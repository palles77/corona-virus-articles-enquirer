We hypothesized that immunostimulation by unmodified siRNA could mediate both RNAi as well as innate immune stimulation depending on the mode of drug delivery. We investigated the potential of immunostimulatory RNAs (isRNAs) to suppress influenza A virus in vivo in the mouse lung. Lipidoid 98N12-5(1) formulated with unmodified siRNA targeting the influenza nucleoprotein gene exhibited antiviral activity. Formulations were optimized to increase antiviral activity, but the antiviral activity of lipidoid-delivered siRNA did not depend on sequence homology to the influenza genome as siRNA directed against unrelated targets also suppressed influenza replication in vivo. This activity was primarily attributed to enhancement of innate immune stimulation by lipidoid-mediated delivery, which indicates increased toll-like receptor (TLR) activation by siRNA. Certain chemical modifications to the siRNA backbone, which block TLR7/8 activation but retain in vitro RNAi activity, prevented siRNA-mediated antiviral activity despite enhanced lipidoid-mediated delivery. Here, we demonstrate that innate immune activation caused by unmodified siRNA can have therapeutically relevant effects, and that these non-RNAi effects can be controlled through chemical modifications and drug delivery.",

In the case of naked unmodified siRNAs targeting RSV, an RNAi-mediated mechanism of action has been confirmed by 5\u0374-RACE detection of the RSV mRNA cleavage site. 12 Lipid carriers have also been used to deliver siRNAs effective against Ebola virus 12 and the DNA virus hepatitis B. 13, 14 In 2003, Ge et al. 15 reported selection of siRNA sequences that efficiently inhibited influenza viral replication in cell culture and chicken eggs. The most promising siRNAs targeting the NP (siNP-1496) and PA genes of Influenza A/PR/8/34 (PR8) were subsequently used by Ge et al. 16 to inhibit influenza in vivo in mouse models of infection. They reported inhibition of viral titers in the lungs of mice following intravenous delivery by linear poly(ethylenimine) (PEI). Tompkins et al. 17 used the same siRNA sequences, which were delivered by hydrodynamic intravenous injection followed by intranasal instillation of oligofectamine/siRNA complexes, to demonstrate protection against a lethal challenge of multiple different influenza subtypes including H5N1. Thomas et al. 18 in 2005 also demonstrated efficient inhibition of influenza in mouse lungs using different forms of PEI as a delivery material for siNP-1496. In all reports, the same green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence (siGFP-949) was used as a control for nonspecific effects.",

            "text": "Initially it was thought that siRNAs avoided the interferon (IFN) response that was observed with longer dsRNA molecules. 19 Induction of intracellular IFN responses was thought to occur only when long dsRNA interacted with cytosolic receptors of RNA such as melanoma differentiation-associated-5 and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I, collectively termed the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like helicases, 20, 21 or activated toll-like receptors (TLRs). 22 However, it has recently been appreciated that siRNA, while shorter in length, can in certain instances interact with TLR3 (refs. 23, 24) , TLR7 (ref. 25) , and TLR8 (ref. 26) to induce IFN responses. This interaction of siRNA with TLRs depends greatly on siRNA structure and sequence, and it can be abrogated through sequence selection strategies and/or chemical modification of siRNA. [27] [28] [29] [30] Chemical modifications such as 2\u0374-fluoro pyrimidines and 2\u0374-O-methyl purines have been shown to prevent the IFN response. 13 2\u0374-O-methyl substitutions to the ribose backbone in particular have been shown to suppress TLR7 and TLR8 interactions with immunostimulatory RNAs (isRNAs). 30 It has been hypothesized that these modifications modulate binding of the TLR through structural conformational changes and affect hydrogen bonding in the minor groove of dsRNA. 28 In both humans and in mice, the IFN-\u03b1-inducing siRNA-TLR7 interaction occurs mainly in the endosome of a specialized cell called the plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC); the pDC circulates in the blood, resides in large numbers in the liver, and is the chief producer of IFN-\u03b1. 21, 25, 31 Many cell types including myeloid DCs (mDCs), monocytes, and monocyte-derived DCs (mo-DCs) express some functional TLR7 (in mice) or TLR8 (in humans).

We hypothesized that, in addition to mediating RNAi, siRNA may have an antiviral effect due to innate immune stimulation, and that this effect may be modulated by method of delivery. We have recently established a combinatorial library of lipid-like materials for delivery of nucleic acids termed \"lipidoids\" that can efficiently deliver small RNA's across cellular barriers. 10 Using high-throughput screening methods, promising novel materials were previously identified that exhibited highly efficient in vitro and in vivo delivery of siRNA molecules to elicit RNAi-mediated downregulation of liver-specific targets. We further investigated the ability of siRNA delivered with one promising candidate material, 98N12-5(1), for its ability to suppress influenza A virus replication in the lung using a murine model of influenza infection. Using a new lipidoid nanoparticle formulation optimized to achieve antiviral effects, we describe the efficient prophylactic inhibition of influenza A in mouse lungs due to innate immune stimulation following the delivery of unmodified siRNA. results 98n12-5(1)-sirnA nanoparticles have antiviral activity Short-interfering RNAs were encapsulated in nanoparticles based upon the 98N12-5(1) lipidoid, a novel lipid-like material that has been used for efficient in vivo siRNA-delivery to the liver 10,39,40 (Figure 1 ). We developed a method for generating stable nanoparticles of lipidoid with cholesterol and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-ceramide in sodium acetate and ethanol. Lipidoid was formulated, extruded at high pressure to normalize particle sizes, and then dialyzed to remove ethanol. These particles consistently exhibit a characteristic size of 70-100 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering with >90% encapsulation of RNA (Supplementary Table S1 ). We investigated the use of dialyzed lipidoid nanoparticles for inhibition of the PR8 strain influenza A virus in a mouse model of infection. Initial studies with formulated 98N12-5(1) particles complexed with siNP-1496 indicated a dose-dependent response following prophylactic treatment 24 hours before infection with a super-lethal challenge of 12,000 plaque-forming units of PR/8 influenza virus. Up to 13-fold (~93%) reduction in lung viral titer compared to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injections was observed at 3 mg/kg siNP-1496 dosing ( Figure 2 ). However, dialyzed lipidoid particles containing siGFP-949 also exhibited a 4.7-fold (~77%) reduction in viral titer at 3 mg/kg. Commercially available PEI, by comparison, demonstrated a 5.8-fold (83%) viral titer reduction at 3 mg/kg dosing of siNP-1496. PEI-siRNA nanoparticles also demonstrated some inhibitory effect at 2 mg/kg dosing (3.6-fold inhibition of viral titer); this effect was similar for both siGFP-949 (data not shown) and siNP-1496.",

Lyophilized lipidoid nanoparticles were formulated with siGFP-949, siNP-1496, or scrambled siNP-1496-sc. We also investigated serum IFN responses following dosing with nanoparticles, as some siRNA sequences are known to induce IFN responses through TLR7 in vivo in mice and TLR7/8 in vitro in human cells. 25, 41 We observed an association between efficient suppression of viral titers (Supplementary Figure S2a) and activation of an innate immune response (Supplementary Figure S2b) using the scrambled siNP-1496 sequence. In addition, viral inhibition in response to an irrelevant siRNA sequence (si\u03b2gal-728) known to induce IFN 41 was similar in magnitude to that observed with siNP-1496 targeting the flu genome. Similar antiviral activity was observed as well with the sequence siPolyA/U, one strand of which (polyA strand) was reported to not stimulate immune responses when formulated with DOTAP 42 ( Table 1) . Antiviral activity was compared side-by-side with siNP-1496 in lyophilized 98N12-5(1) nanoparticles. Surprisingly, siNP, si\u03b2gal, and siPolyA/U lipidoid particles all suppressed influenza reproduction equivalently, achieving over 90-fold reduction in viral titer compared to PBS controls (Figure 3b) . containing both siNP and si\u03b2gal elicited high levels of serum IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1, while neither siGFP-nanoparticles nor PBS injections generated detectable levels of serum IFN-\u03b1 (Figure 3b ).",

[28] [29] [30] The siNP-1496 sequence was modified with various backbone and nucleic acid substitutions ( Table 2) . Immune stimulation by modified siRNAs was first investigated in vitro by transfecting modified siRNA into cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with Gene Porter 2 or DOTAP. IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 levels of culture supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 24 hours after transfection (Figure 4) . Incorporation of neither deoxythymidine overhangs nor substitution with a phosphorothioate linkage was able to prevent immune stimulation. Substituting the hydroxyl group on the 2\u0374 carbon of ribose with a 2\u0374-O-methyl group prevented immune stimulation when present on either sense or antisense strands in vitro (Figure 4) . Just a single base (uridine) modification with 2\u0374-O-methyl could prevent immune stimulation, as the siRNA duplex formed with si4767 (sense) and si3590 (antisense) did not elicit immune stimulation (Figure 4) . Chemically modified siRNAs retained the ability to inhibit influenza through RNAi mechanisms in vitro ( Figure 5 ) with the IC 50 of all duplexes in the sub-nmol/l range (<0.4 nmol/l). Notably, duplexes with the si3590-modified strand exhibited a slightly reduced potency with an IC 50 approaching 1 nmol/l, though siRNA duplexes formed from more heavily 2\u0374-O-methyl substituted RNA strands such as si3589 did not suffer from this slight reduction in activity. A subset of siNP-1496 siRNA representing unmodified and chemically modified duplexes that retain full in vitro RNAi activity was selected for in vivo investigations of immune stimulation and antiviral activity. These modified siNP-1496 sequences were incorporated into the optimal formulation of lyophilized 98N12-5(1) nanoparticles. We investigated both immune stimulation and suppression of influenza in vivo in a mouse model. Chemical modifications that blocked immune stimulation in human PBMCs in vitro also prevented activation of IFN-\u03b1 and TNF-\u03b1 in vivo in Black Swiss mice (Figure 6a) .",

Thus, we have established a correlation between functional viral particles, as measured through plaque-forming assay, and levels of viral mRNA (Supplementary Figure S3) . Measurement of viral mRNA levels can be normalized to a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, to investigate specific inhibition of the siRNA target influenza genome. As measured by branched DNA assay for viral RNA levels, blocking immune stimulation abrogated antiviral responses (Figure 6b ). In addition, the chemically modified GL3 si1995/Luc sequence targeting an irrelevant gene, firefly luciferase, formulated in lyophilized 98N12-5(1) particles did not induce either significant immune stimulation or antiviral responses. Delivery of immunostimulatory siRNA's (si3583/3584 and si4746/4747) was associated with tenfold reduction in normalized viral mRNA levels, compared to PBS-treated mice, and exhibited significantly greater antiviral activity than siRNA modified to abolish immunostimulatory activity. These data together provide evidence that replication of the influenza virus was specifically inhibited by the IFN responses and was not due to carrier-mediated toxicity.",

PEI-mediated delivery of the siNP-1496 sequence was not previously found to induce an IFN response, 16, 18 although our results indicate that the antiviral activity of PEI was also relatively low. Commonly used and commercially available cationic lipid transfection agents such as DOTAP and Lipofectamine have been used to investigate the biology of isRNA activity in vitro. 13, 25, 28, 41 Both lipid-and PEI-based nanoparticles have also been reported to generate isRNA activity in vivo. 25, 30, 45, 46 Here, we have demonstrated that the observed antiviral properties of siNP-1496 siRNA are related to delivery-dependent innate immune stimulation rather than an RNAi-mediated antiviral effect.

Antiviral activity of lyophilized 98N12-5(1) nanoparticles was superior to PEI nanoparticles encapsulating the same siRNAs (Figure 2) , and amplified the difference in isRNA activity between different sequences (Figure 3) .

The previously identified isRNA, si\u03b2gal-728 (ref. 41) , also exhibited antiviral activity. Although the polyA strand of siPolyA/U has been reported to not induce IFN responses when delivered with DOTAP, 42 when combined with the polyU strand in the lipidoid nanoparticle this RNA also had significant antiviral activity (Figure 3) , likely due to the high uridine content. 25, 26 Delivery with lyophilized 98N12-5(1) nanoparticles preferentially to IFN-producing cells is likely to increase isRNA potential of any given siRNA sequence including the siGFP-949 sequence.

PEI, on the other hand, is highly efficient for rapid endosomal escape 47, 48 and therefore may not release significant RNA in the endosome for interaction with TLRs. Lyophilization of lipidoid nanoparticles increases particle sizes and increases antiviral activity. However, the lyophilization process itself is not sufficient for achieving high antiviral activity because dialysis before lyophilization results in particles with decreased antiviral activity (Supplementary Figure S1) .

While we did not observe significant anti-flu effect due to RNAi, large antiviral effect was caused by the immunostimulatory aspect of certain siRNA. The sense strand of the siNP-1496 sequence has been suggested to activate human PBMCs in vitro. 30 Our findings are consistent with this report. The siRNA duplexes containing 3\u0374-overhangs with deoxythymidine showed immunostimulatory activity in vitro in human PBMCs (Figure 4 ) or when formulated and tested in vivo (Figure 6a) . Further modification of the 3\u0374-overhangs with a phosphorothioate linkage also had little effect on siRNA-mediated immune activation. Only 2\u0374-Omethyl modifications were able to block IFN responses in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, only 2\u0374-O-methyl modifications blocked the in vivo antiviral response (Figure 6b) . Previous reports have indicated that a minimum of two residues must be modified to prevent immune stimulation. 30 We observed blockade of TLR activity with 2\u0374-O-methyl modification of just one central uridine residue (modified strand si3590; Table 2 ) in the antisense strand of the NP-1496 sequence that efficiently prevented IFN responses in human PBMCs (Figure 4) . This central base modification also slightly decreased the potency of RNAi activity, although it was not eliminated (Figure 5) , and was not further investigated in vivo. Interestingly, more extensive modification with multiple 2\u0374-O-methyl bases on the sense strand (si3589) molecule did not change RNAi potency. All of the other modifications completely preserved in vitro RNAi activity. While we did not directly test the immunostimulatory activity of our siRNAs in isolated mouse cells in vitro, we have observed similar immunostimulatory activity in vitro with human PBMCs and in vivo in mice consistent with other literature descriptions. 25, 30, 41 Recently, Robbins et al. 44 reported on the misinterpretation of anti-influenza effects of the siNP-1496 sequence due to immune stimulation. They showed that the siGFP-949 sequence is uniquely nonstimulatory for unknown reasons, though the low GU-content of the siGFP-949 sequence could be a factor. They also demonstrated that 2\u0374-O-methyl modification of all uridine nucleotides in the sense strand of siNP-1496 can abrogate immune responses and antiviral activity. 44 Our results presented here are consistent with the observed differences in immunostimulatory nature of various siRNAs contained in the report by Robbins et al. Although we have demonstrated that minimal modification is necessary to prevent undesired immune stimulation, the exact position and number of chemical modifications required to abolish immunostimulation must be tested and confirmed experimentally on a case-by-case basis.",

Despite evidence that chemically modified modified siNP-1496 exhibited potent RNAi-mediated antiviral activity in vitro (Figure 5 ) without significant immune stimulatory activity both in vitro (Figure 4) and in vivo (Figure 6) , these siRNA did not reduce virus titer in mice when delivered in lipidoid formulation. However, using a different formulation of 98N12-5(1), we have previously observed RNAi-mediated antiviral activity following direct pulmonary instillation in a mouse model of RSV infection. 10 The formulation of 98N12-5(1) described here was optimized for maximum prophylactic effect, which was due to immunostimulatory delivery of RNA. It is possible that the relative contribution of RNAi-mediated gene silencing may be more significant for other delivery methods or other formulations of 98N12-5(1). Stably expressed siNP-1496 is capable of knocking down reporter gene expression (data not shown) and inhibiting influenza virus production in cell culture. 16 The lack of observable in vivo RNAi mediated by formulations with siNP-1496 highlights the importance of siRNA delivery in achieving the desired RNAi activity. Thus, additional development is needed to facilitate RNAi-mediated anti-influenza activity of systemically administered siNP-1496 in vivo.",

As TLR7/8 activity is both cell-specific and compartmentalized to the late endosome, controlled delivery can influence the level of immunostimulatory siRNA activity. As TLR7/8 engagement is important for innate antiviral responses, 28, 35 avoiding TLRs is important in the development of RNAi therapies in the infectious disease setting. Additionally, excessive activity of TLR7/8 leading to increased type 1 IFN secretion from the pDC has been associated with autoimmunity. 50 When siRNAs are administered in vivo they must therefore avoid sustained internalization into the endosome of pDCs and other TLR7/8-responsive cells, or siRNAs must be modified to prevent TLR7/8 activation as we have demonstrated. Nevertheless, an attractive therapeutic potential use of controlled siRNA delivery would be simultaneous RNAi activity and immuno stimulatory RNA activity from the same RNA molecule. 46 A single RNA with dual functionality may therefore be readily achieved by controlled delivery to a cytosolic location for RNAi activity and an endosomal location in pDCs for innate immune activation. We show that these antiviral IFN and related cytokine responses mediated by certain siRNAs in vivo can be influenced by delivery material and formulation and can be suppressed by chemical modifications to the siRNA. Our work offers a proof of concept of optimizing in vivo drug delivery for isRNA activity, as well as evidence that even a robust delivery system can be rendered immunosilent by certain chemical modifications to siRNA.",

Complexed lipidoid-RNA nanoparticles were then extruded 10 passes through a double 200-nm membrane (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ) on a Northern Lipids (British Columbia, Canada) extrusion system at 40 \u00b0C. To remove ethanol before injection, nanoparticles were dialyzed in a Slide-A-Lyzer 3500 molecular weight cutoff dialysis cassette (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) against PBS. For lyophilization, 10 mg of sucrose was added per ml of extruded complexes before freezing at \u221280 \u00b0C for >2 hours followed by >1 day-lyophilization.",
