Nucleic acid-targeted molecular techniques are increasingly being used to provide high sensitivity and specificity, short test turnaround time, and automatic and high-throughput processing. In-house and commercially available molecular methods have been developed to qualitatively and quantitatively detect and identify a single or a panel of clinically encountered respiratory tract viruses in a single reaction. Molecular techniques are being gradually introduced in routine laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections. However, their performance characteristics and limitations must be clearly understood by both laboratory personnel and clinicians to ensure proper utilization and interpretation.",

Appropriate management of patients with viral respiratory illnesses requires rapid and accurate identification of the etiologic agent of these infections. Unfortunately, identifying a specific viral respiratory pathogen in these infections can be problematic and elusive for several reasons, such as the wide range of potential viral pathogens that can cause similar clinical manifestations, the insensitivity of conventional laboratory diagnostic tests, and the presence of new and mutating viral pathogens. Rapid detection and identification of viral pathogens causing respiratory tract infections has been demonstrated to significantly decrease the duration of hospitalization and reduce management costs, and to avoid additional laboratory testing and unnecessary antibiotic use; additionally, rapid detection and identification help to guide specific antiviral therapy and appropriate isolation precautions [1, 2] .",

However, as a result of the application of novel detecting techniques, other viruses have been added to the list of significant viral respiratory pathogens: coronaviruses (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinoviruses (hRhV), human bocaviruses (hBoV), PIV4, the newly discovered parvovirus types 4 and 5, mimivirus, respiratory polyomaviruses, and xenotropic murine leukemia virusrelated virus (XMRV). Some of these emerging pathogens (identified since 2000) can cause pandemic or fatal respiratory infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, avian influenza viruses (H5N1, H7N7, and H7N3), and swine influenza viruses (H1N1); furthermore, the clinical significance of others is still not known. Indeed, all of the viruses mentioned are associated with similar and atypical clinical presentations and infect both upper and lower respiratory tracts, which makes it very difficult for clinicians to distinguish the causative pathogen without a laboratory diagnosis.",

It should be kept in mind that falsenegative rapid antigen results can be expected, and should not be interpreted as excluding the possibility of infection caused by the tested viral pathogen. With low sensitivities, rapid antigen tests were usually relegated to point-of-care testing for influenza in defined settings. Serology-based procedures have been primarily in surveillance and epidemiology studies, whereas their applications in diagnosis of viral respiratory diseases have been limited. A single serum sample to detect viral-specific IgG is not useful for diagnosis. Instead, paired acute-and convalescent-phase sera, collected at least 10 days apart, are needed to detect a fourfold or greater increase in serum antibody levels indicative of a recent infection.",

Nucleic acid amplification tests led by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were developed for most respiratory viruses by the end of the decade; today, they are emerging to be used in the routine clinical laboratory as the preferred method for viral diagnostic testing, either as an adjunct to or a replacement for another method. Real-time technology and the ability to perform multiplex testing have facilitated this emergence. Molecular techniques have found their niches in laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections by providing rapid and highly sensitive tools to detect and identify the causal pathogens. They also allow assessment of the impact of a wider array of potential pathogens on viral respiratory infections than previously possible, and targetspecific (multiplex) approaches have proved feasible for enhanced broad-spectrum respiratory virus diagnosis. A wide range of both target and signal amplification nucleic acid amplification methods could be applied to respiratory virus detection. The target amplification technique has the advantage of sensitivity above signal amplification, but the latter may be simpler and less laborious for high throughput. In this review, we focus on commercially available molecular assays, and discuss the performance characteristics required to successfully implement molecular methods for routine diagnosis of viral respiratory infections.",

Pandemics follow the emergence of a novel virus subtype with a new combination of the hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) gene. Rapid antigen assays for the detection of influenza are commonly available, although negative results using these assays increase significantly with the increasing age of the patient. Real-time PCR or culture is necessary to avoid false-negative results in older patients. Molecular methods for detecting influenza viruses were described as early as 1991. Various targets have been used, including the matrix, HA, and NA genes. The first commercially available assay was the Hexaplex assay (Prodesse Inc., Waukesha, WI); it had an analytical sensitivity of 10 copies for influenza A and five copies for influenza B [6] , and set the standard for the detection of influenza viruses. Since then, it has been developed and is now a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved multiplex RT-PCR assay (Pro-Flu+; Prodesse Inc.) for detecting influenza A, influenza B, and RSV. According to the manufacturer, it has a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 93% for influenza A and 98% and 99% for influenza B, respectively [7, 8] . Another FDAapproved multiplex panel is the xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada), which is capable of detecting 12 respiratory viruses and subtypes including influenza. This assay uses multiplex PCR and the Luminex x-MAP suspension array to have a reported clinical sensitivity of 100% for influenza A [9\u2022, 10, 11] .",

However, more recently, they have been reported to have higher-than-expected rates in respiratory hospitalizations. Rhinoviruses were not considered to be clinically important by infectious disease clinicians until recently; they were reported to cause serious lower respiratory tract infections in young children, adults, and immunocompromised individuals. Although rhinoviruses can be detected by viral culture, most clinical laboratories did not provide rhinovirus diagnosis until recently; several in-house developed molecular assays showed sensitivities for rhinovirus detection of 85% using NASBA and 83% using RT-PCR [25] . Four recently introduced commercial multiplex assays-the ResPlex II assay (Qiagen), the MultiCode-PLx RVP assay (EraGen), the Seeplex RV assay (Seegene), and the xTAG RVP assay (Luminex)-cover rhinovirus as a target; however, only the xTAG RVP assay is approved by the FDA for rhinovirus detection, and was 100% sensitive and 91% specific in clinical evaluations [24\u2022\u2022] . Of note, there appear to be rhinoviruses not detected using these molecular methods or positive results that cannot be confirmed by culture, which implies that more sequence data from different rhinovirus serotypes and currently circulating strains are needed. Five coronaviruses species-229E, OC43, SARS-CoV, NL63, and HKU1-have been described to cause human respiratory diseases. CoV OC43 and 229E have been associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infection in a variety of settings, including nosocomial infections in high-risk immunocompromised children and hospitalized elderly patients. SARS-CoV, the causative agent of an outbreak of SARS worldwide from 2002 to 2003, has not been found to circulate in people since 2004.",

Rapid detection of oseltamivir resistance in severe pandemic H1N1 infections is essential for patients to receive maximum therapeutic benefit, and is useful for clinicians to allow for change to an effective treatment at a much earlier stage if resistance is found. Recent studies have reported the use of novel molecular methods to screen for the presence of the H275Y resistance mutation in the neuraminidase gene [58] [59] [60] [61] . In addition to accurate detection of the H275Y oseltamivirresistance allele, samples collected at multiple time points even showed a switch from wild-type oseltamivir-sensitive 275 H to oseltamivir-resistant 275Y population after 9 days of treatment. In the light of emerging resistance, close monitoring and understanding of the nature and dynamics of resistance mutations in newly emerging strains should be a priority.",

Serological tests still remain useful in epidemiological monitoring, whereas viral culture permits full identification and characterization of novel strains or emerging viruses, as well as determination of antiviral phenotypic susceptibility. The enhanced sensitivity and specificity of molecular methods have resulted in conventional methods now becoming secondary tiers in the triage of diagnostic options for investigating outbreaks and epidemiological studies. Molecular methods can also provide a much shorter test turnaround time to accurate results, which is vital for timely and effective intervention during an outbreak of pandemic viral respiratory infections. Molecular methods have been increasingly used in the molecular epidemiological studies of predominant etiological agents, such as influenza virus and RSV during seasonal epidemics [62] [63] [64] [65] .",

Recent studies have been reported to support the usefulness of molecular assays for implementation of a molecular monitoring system for endemic and epidemic viral respiratory infections or institutional outbreaks [66] [67] [68] [69] . Multitargeted molecular assays are now becoming more cost-effective, with the increased cost of testing offset by a reduction in patient care cost due to an earlier diagnostic result provided by molecular methods. This economic advantage can be even more obvious for institutional outbreak and pandemic viral respiratory infections, in which time-to-result is of the most importance to prevent the spread of disease. However, well-defined outcome studies are still needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of these rapid molecular assays.",

In-house and commercially available molecular methods have been increasingly used to detect and identify common respiratory viruses as well as recently identified pathogens. As techniques have advanced, a panel of viral pathogens now can be qualitatively and quantitatively detected in a single reaction, which significantly enhances diagnostic efficacy and yield. Implementation of molecular tests for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections is limited by technical complexity, costs, and lack of proper validation and standardization of assays. The performance characteristics and limitations of these molecular tests must be clearly understood by laboratory personnel and clinicians to ensure proper utilization and interpretation. Prompt exchange of relevant information between the clinician and the laboratory is essential for the molecular diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. Moreover, interpretive reports may play a role, because mixed infections occur frequently.",
