            "text": "Specific pathogen free kittens werevaccinated with an unattenuated field isolate of canine coronavirus (ccv) either by aerosol or subcutaneously, and received boosting vaccinations four weeks later. Aerosolisation elicited a homologous virus-neutralising (VN) antibody response that increased steadily over a fourweek period and levelled off one to two weeks after revaccination. The initial aerosolised dose produced an asymptomatic infection with excretion of eev from the oropharynx up to eight days after vaccination; virus shedding was not detected, however, after the second inoculation. Cats vaccinated subcutaneously developed low VN antibody titres after the first eev dose and experienced a strong anamnestic response after the second dose. Neutrallsing antibody titres then levelled off one to two weeks after revaccination at mean values somewhat lower than in cats vaccinated by aerosol. eev was not isolated from the oropharynx after either subcutaneous dose. Four weeks after eev boosting inoculations, vaccinated cats and sham-vaccinated control cats were divided into three subgroups~nd challenged by aerosol with.the virulent ucm strain of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV ucm) at three different dosage levels. Five of six cats (including sham-vaccinated controls) given the lowest challenge dose showed no signs of disease, while all other cats developed lesions typical of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) . The five surviving cats developed FIP after subsequent challenge with a fivefold higher dose of F1PV. Thus heterotypic vaccination of cats with eev did not provide effective protection against FIPV challenge. FELINE infectious peritonitis virus (FlPV), a member of the family Coronaviridae, is an important pathogen of domestic and exotic cats (Barlough and Weiss 1983 , Barlough and Stoddart 1986 ,Scott 1986 , Pedersen 1987 . It is the causative agent of a lethal, immunologically mediated vasculitis, feline infectious \u00b7Present address: Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma 74078, USA peritonitis (FlP), characterised by fibrinous peritonitis or pleuritis and formation of disseminated pyogranulomas. Current therapies, usually consisting of corticosteroids or other more potent cytoreductive drugs, are only palliative in nature and in most instances are ineffective at halting the relentlessly progressive course of the disease.",

Experiments thus far reported using various viruses within the FIPV antigenic cluster (Pedersen et al 1978) have not been successful in conferring uniformly protective immunity (Toma et al 1979 , Woods and Pedersen 1979 , Pedersen et al 1981 , 1984 , Pedersen and Black 1983 , Barlough et al 1984b , Pedersen and floyd 1985 . Paradoxically, because of the immunopathological nature of the disease, vaccination with some feline coronaviruses has actually predisposed cats to the development of FIP and produced a more rapid and fulminating disease after FlPV challenge. Heterotypic vaccination using cross reactive coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV) of pigs, canine coronavirus lccvl, d'r human coronavirus 229E) has neither sensitised nor protected cats in most experiments. The mechanisms of sensitisation and immunity in FlP are incompletely understood at present, but it may be supposed that, as with many virus infections, a properly balanced cell-mediated immune response involving T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and activated macrophages is essential for effective host resistance.",

Vaccination with ccv produced no clinical signs of infection, did not result in excretion of detectable virus in faeces, and did not protect cats against FIPV challenge. The number of cats used in this first study was small, however, and only a large challenge dose of FIPV was investigated. A larger study using a greater number of cats was then undertaken, vaccinating by aerosol and subcutaneous routes, assaying for virus excretion from the oropharynx and challenging with three different doses of FIPV, all of which were smal1erthan the dose used in the pilot study. The results of this more comprehensive vaccine trial are the subject of the present communication.",

In an earlier pilot study (Barlough et al I984b) , two cats were vaccinated with ccv (Karbatsch) oronasally and challenged with a large dose (approximately 1000 101(0) of FIPV UCDl by aerosol. Both cats succumbed to FIP with a mean survival time of 25' 5 \u00b1 2' 5 days, and shamvaccinated control cats experienced a similar disease course (mean survival time 23' 5 \u00b1 I\u00b7 5 days). Feline coronavirus antibody-sensitised control cats, however, died 8\u00b7 5 \u00b1 O\u00b75 days after F1PV challenge (P<0\u00b7005). It was therefore concluded that vaccination of cats with ccv did not sensitise them to develop accelerated FIP after subsequent FIPV exposure. The expanded study reported here was performed to evaluate more fully the potential of ccv as a heterotypic immunogen for FIP. Cats were vaccinated with ccv by aerosol to induce a potentially more protective mucosal immunity against aerosol challenge than the oronasal vaccination used in the pilot study. In addition, lower, graded challenge doses (5 to (250 101(0) of FIPV were used. It was not possible, however, to demonstrate convincing protection against even the lowest FIPV challenge dose; thus it appears that vaccination of cats with ccv cannot confer protection against FIPV.",

Considered together with the apparent absence of shedding following the boosting ccv vaccination, it would appear that limited replication of ccv occurred in the aerosol-vaccinated cats and that these cats were then to some degree immunised against subsequent ccv infection. By contrast, subcutaneous inoculation of cats with ccv elicited an initial, low level VN response that was boosted considerably by revaccination, data indicative of an anamnestic response to an inert immunogen (Mims 1982) and suggesting little or no replication of ccv in cats vaccinated subcutaneously.",

In the previous experiment, however, cats developed KELA titres only after repeated daily oronasal administration of CCV, not after the initial two doses. As descr;Jbed previously (Barlough et al 1984b) , . this phenomenon is attributed to two factors. First, administration Qf low doses of coronaviruses can result in production of only neutralising antibodies directed against the viral peplomer while higher doses can result in additional antibodies to non-peplomer determinants that are non-neutralising. Second, neutralising anti-peplomer antibody is detected by VN, but perhaps not by KELA due to loss or antigenic alteration of the fragile peplomers during TGEV antigen preparation. Cats in the present experiment may not have been given a dose of ccv sufficient to produce detectable non-peplomer anti-. body, and thus remained negative by KELA until after lethal FlPV challenge. The dramatic anamnestic response in the aerosolvaccinated cats suggests some priming of the immune response by non-peplomer determinants before challenger, the meagre KELA response of subcutaneously vaccinated' cats after challenge may reflect a smaller degree of priming attributable to little or no ccv replication. As in the pilot study. shamvaccinated cats remained negative by KELA even after lethal FIPV challenge. The authors have often encountered the absence of a KELA response against TGEV in coronavirus-naive cats after experimental FIPV challenge, and it is probably due to a combination of the induction of a primary rather than anamnestic immune response, the swiftly fatal experimental disease course, immune complex formation and lesser sensitivity of the heterologous assay.",

Previous studies have shown that some cats with pre-existing coronavirus antibody, when challenged with FIPV, develop a more rapid and fulminating form of the disease than do seronegative cats similarly challenged (Toma et al1979, Pedersen and Boyle 1980 , Weiss et a11980, Pedersen et al1981, 1984 , Weiss 1981 , Weiss and Scott 1981 , Pedersen and Black 1983 ,Barlough et al 1984b , Pedersen and floyd 1985 . Feline coronavirus strains appear to predominate as sensitising coronaviruses; neither TGEV, human coronavirus 229E nor ccv has produced significant sensitisation in experiments reported thus far. Sensitisation appears to be coronavirus strain-specific and dependent on the identity not only of the sensitisingvirus but also of the challenge strain. The sensitisation phenomenon has proved to be one of the major impediments to the development of a safe and effective FIP vaccine; thus it was hoped that a non-sensitising, cross-reactive coronavirus such as ccv might be able to provide immunity without sensitisation. To date, however, this strategy has not met with success.",

Results from work carried out over the past decade suggest, however, that the humoral immune response is probably of minor significance and, when of a sensitising nature, may even be detrimental to the host. In other reports of FIP immunisation attempts and in more recent experiments performed in this laboratory, vaccinated cats have responded unpredictably and idiosyncratically to virulent FIPV challenge. Protection has often been an all-or-nothing phenomenon wherein some cats are not protected yet others are completely resistant to identical challenge doses administered in an identical manner.
