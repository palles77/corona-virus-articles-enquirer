Currently the performance of available animal models for immunization studies using HRV challenge is very limited. The cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a well-recognized model for the study of human respiratory viral infections. In this work we show that, without requiring any genetic modification of either the host or the virus, intranasal infection of cotton rats with HRV16 resulted in measurable isolation of infective virus, lower respiratory tract pathology, mucus production, and expression of interferon-activated genes. Intramuscular immunization with live HRV16 generated robust protective immunity that correlated with high serum levels of neutralizing antibodies. In addition, cotton rats treated prophylactically with hyperimmune anti-HRV16 serum were protected against HRV16 intranasal challenge. Finally, protection by immunization was efficiently transferred from mothers to newborn animals resulting in a substantial reduction of infectious virus loads in the lung following intranasal challenge. Overall, our results demonstrate that the cotton rat provides valuable additional model development options for testing vaccines and prophylactic therapies against rhinovirus infection.",

Due to the occurrence of more than 100 HRV serotypes with extensive sequence variability in the antigenic sites and the lack of animal models to test the efficacy of approaches to prevent or treat infection in vivo, no rhinovirus vaccines are available for use in humans.

A brief plateau of viral loads was detectable in the nose and trachea between 6-10 h p.i. followed by a decrease and clearance of virus.

Higher infectious virus titers were recovered from the lungs of animals infected with HRV16 than from animals infected with a similar dose of hRV1B, suggesting that the cotton rat is significantly more permissive to infection by HRV16.

Although the data from examination of viral load in the respiratory tract over time is certainly compatible with a non-permissive model of infection and clearance of the inoculum over time, the differences observed between the course of infection by HRV16 and HRV1B together with the detection of (\u00c0)vRNA in infected tissues suggest that HRV16 may be actually replicating in the cotton rat.

Unlike the laboratory mouse, which either lacks or has defective Mx genes, the cotton rat has a set of fully functional Mx genes. As described for the human Mx counterparts [31, 32, 44, 45] , cotton rat Mx genes are expressed in response to infection with influenza and RSV.

In our model of i.n. infection, the pulmonary infectious viral load is measurable within the 48 h following instillation and thus provides a powerful readout for assessment of protection by immunization and passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies. We found that i.m. inoculation of live virus but not UV-inactivated resulted in a significant decrease of viral loads in nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung of challenged animals suggesting that replication at the site of injection played a role in the resulting. A measurable protection against challenge was achieved with only one immunization (Fig. 3) . The immunogenicity of the inoculum was likely dependent upon viral replication in the area of immunization since UV-inactivation of the virus completely abolished protection. The protection achieved with live virus was specific for HRV16 since no protection was conferred by immunization with live HRV1B. These results could be due to the apparent lack of replication of HRV1B in the cotton rat respiratory tract (data not shown), but are most likely the result of the lack of shared neutralizing epitopes between HRV16 and HRV1B. The spectrum of cross-reactivities of cotton rat anti-HRV16 neutralizing antibodies should be further investigated in view of the recent reports regarding the induction of in vitro cross-neutralizing antibodies after immunization with recombinant HRV14 and HRV89 VP1 [22] , and the weak induction of HRV1B binding antibodies but not neutralizing antibodies in the mouse by immunization with HRV16 VP0 [23] .",

Importantly, our data highlight the large potential of the cotton rat to provide an experimental platform complementary to that offered by the available mouse models to further evaluate the immunogenicity of individual HRV capsid proteins [22, 23, 47] , some of the already identified anti-HRV antibodies with documented neutralizing activities in vitro [52] , antibodies targeting select domains of the virus receptor [53] , as well as other alternative antibody-based strategies under consideration [54] to support new developments in this area.",

Lung homogenates from 3 animals previously immunized with HRV16 (neutralization titers > 1280), subsequently challenged and sacrificed 10 h after challenge (h1, h2, h3) were mixed with homogenates of a na\u00efve, challenged animal (PBS i.m.) also sacrificed 10 h p.i. Mixed homogenates in the indicated dilution (immune:control) were then titrated for determination of viral load. A control curve (media) was performed by diluting a control homogenate with titration media. The reduction of resulting titers in all mixes was consistent with the dilution factor and not consistent with neutralization occurring ex vivo.",
