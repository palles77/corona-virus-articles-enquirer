Therefore, ExoN(-) virus generated in 265 the presence of an IFN-\u03b2-mediated antiviral state requires 10-fold more genome RNA containing 266 particles to generate 1 PFU than WT-MHV generated in cells pretreated with or without IFN or 267ExoN(-) virus generated in untreated cells. These data suggest that the IFN-mediated restriction 268 of ExoN(-) virus in DBT cells occurs at the level of subsequent infection by reducing particle 269 infectivity. 270 Next, we tested whether the effects of IFN on ExoN(-) viruses were intrinsic to the 271 viruses produced.

If nsp14 ExoN is degrading viral dsRNA, ExoN inactivation should increase 313 intracellular dsRNA accumulation, resulting in a concomitant increase in IFN-\u03b2 expression or 314 activation of RNase L during infection. We neither observed IFN-\u03b2 up-regulation nor RNase L 315 activation over the course of ExoN(-) virus infection (Fig. 4A and B), and rRNA was intact at all 316 time-points tested (Fig. 4B). Therefore, at least two possible explanations exist: 1.) ExoN does 317 not function to degrade dsRNA or 2.) ExoN does degrade dsRNA, but the detection of this 318 PAMP is unchanged during ExoN(-) virus infection due to sufficient antagonism by other CoV 319 proteins. Basal OAS expression levels correlate with RNase L activation (30). Thus, we 320 pretreated DBTs with IFN-\u03b2 to up-regulate OAS and RNase L expression.

Due to the pleiotropic nature of IFN-\u03b2, more than one mechanism may be acting. To 359 date, the majority of our understanding of nsp14 ExoN activity is in the context of proofreading 360 during CoV replication(13, 15, 16, 32). CoVs lacking ExoN activity demonstrate an increase in 361 mutation frequency relative to WT (15, 16). Thus, it is possible that ExoN(-) virus replication in 362 IFN pretreated cells results in further alteration of ExoN(-) virus mutation frequency. Certainly, 363 an increase or decrease in mutation frequency could impair viral replication during a subsequent 364 infection. In addition, an ISG may act to hypermutate the large CoV genome in the absence of 365 ExoN activity, rendering viral progeny less viable. ISGs that increase viral mutation frequency 366 have been described such as adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) and 367 apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) (27, 28). 368 Further, another ISG, SAMHD1, may inhibit HIV replication by limiting nucleotide pools, a 369 known contributor to increased viral mutation frequency (33-35). Moreover, other possible 370 mechanisms outside of altered mutation frequency exist. For instance, in the absence of ExoN 371 activity, terminal RNA modifications, recombination, and/or replicase protein interactions 372 mediated by nsp14 ExoN may be disrupted to a greater extent in the presence of an IFN-\u03b2-373 mediated antiviral state. 374 All rights reserved.

The number of viral genome RNA copies of both 497 reference and silent viruses were determined relative to the appropriate standard curve. The 498 number of viral genome RNA copies relative to the number of silent virus genome RNA copies 499 was determined for each virus and condition.
