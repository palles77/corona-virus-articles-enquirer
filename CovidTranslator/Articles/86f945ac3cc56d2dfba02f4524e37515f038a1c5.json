            "text": "At Honolulu life fell apart. . . . [People] left the town by the hundreds, the healthy to get away from the loathsome disease and the sick to escape what they knew not. . . . They went to the hills to wait out their time-and to spread the disease without knowing it-or they took to boats and canoes in defiance of the Health Commissioner's orders and headed for the outer islands. [Description of the role of travel during the smallpox outbreak in Hawai'i in 1853.] 1 Historically, major epidemic diseases, including plague and smallpox, have been transmitted internationally by travelers. 2 The potential for disease being spread by travelers is critical today, in part because travel is so common. In 2000, approximately 699 million international passengers traveled by air, accounting for an estimated 40% or more of international passenger transportation. 3 In 1992, the Institute of Medicine formally recognized international travel as a major factor in the emergence of new diseases, stating, \"The ease with which people can travel around the world today means that 'exotic' diseases can move just as quickly\" as people can move. 4 One possible means by which a pathogen might arrive in the United States or spread rapidly within the country is through exposure and infection of airline passengers. If the occurrence of the illness was not recognized during the flight and quarantine not imposed upon landing, exposed passengers would likely disembark and leave the airport terminal quickly. As has already been demonstrated for tuberculosis and influenza, infection of other passengers can occur if a person with a communicable illness travels onboard an aircraft. 5, 6 Terrorists might also use public conveyances as a means for spreading infectious diseases. Terrorists might target transportation systems because they are accessible venues in which members of the public congregate with predictable regularity. 7 In the context of combating bioterrorism, assessing the role of the traveler becomes increasingly critical because of the potential for passengers to serve not only as targets but also as possible vehicles for disseminating a biological weapon. The experiences of two recent large-scale biological counterterrorism exercises, Dark Winter and TOP OFF, show that risks associated with airline travel are potentially of serious concern for those attempting to mitigate the spread of a biological attack. 8, 9 Options for providing effective control measures diminish with time from exposure; therefore, determining the length of time needed to locate airline travelers who might have been exposed in-flight to an infectious agent is imperative for preparedness efforts.",

Passengers on-board the plane were alerted that a suspected case of measles had been identified and were provided with general illness information; they were not detained.

The letter also advised passengers that measles vaccination might be of benefit to non-immune individuals if administered within 72 hours after exposure. Passengers were requested to seek medical consultation if they were unsure of their immunity to measles. Attached to the letter was a form to record the day and time the passenger received the notification of exposure to measles. On the morning of May 22, 2000-24 hours after the flight arrived-HDOH began attempts to contact all passengers from the flight by obtaining a passenger manifest and copies of the U.S. Customs declaration forms. The Customs declaration form requires individuals entering the country to provide an address in the U.S. where they can be reached. To minimize the time needed to contact visitors, HDOH disease investigators divided the passengers into groups on the basis of hotel destinations and used their knowledge of local tour operators to identify groups that may have been on the index flight. During the next several days, disease investigators went to hotels and left telephone messages in an effort to locate passengers. If investigators determined that hotel or tour operator staffers might be the first to reach any given passenger, these staffers were given copies of the letters, instructed on the urgency of providing this information to their clients, and asked to ensure that the passenger recorded the time they first read the letter. The forms were collected during the following days. Disease investigators used telephone contact as much as possible to reach passengers who were residents of Hawai'i, but also conducted home visits when necessary. Passengers who had traveled on to the U.S. mainland were contacted with the assistance of local health departments. The airline notified the flight crew, who were not included in the analyses reported here.",

This might be particularly true for longer flights where opportunities for exposure might be greater. In the age of bioterrorism, passengers might also be intentionally exposed to a communicable pathogen disseminated by a dispersal device. In such a scenario, health officials may not recognize that an exposure has occurred among air travelers until after the incubation period has elapsed, making it difficult to reach other fellow passengers within the time frame for effective isolation or treatment.",

However, this passenger was not identified by airline personnel as being seriously ill until the flight was underway, indicating that improvement in efforts to restrict airline travel for ill individuals is needed. Even more important from a disease control perspective is that proscriptions on travel during major epidemics could be ignored. 1 Instead of the contact tracing approach we employed, a more immediate way to communicate with exposed airline passengers would be to use the media to alert the general public. Radio, television, and newspapers could reach a greater number of exposed individuals more quickly than the contact tracing approach used here. However, widespread dissemination of such information might result in panic; in certain situations, waiting for confirmatory testing before making announcements through the media might be preferable. In addition, extensive news circulation of a possible in-flight exposure would likely result in individuals who were not exposed seeking care and prophylaxis, perhaps diverting limited health agency resources from the task of finding and treating those with actual risk.",

This information was useful in facilitating timely contact with the passengers on this flight, but had limitations. Customs forms were not generated for all passengers on the flight manifest because only one name is required on the form (one form can be used to represent multiple travelers in a group or family). In our experience, the total number of people identified on the Customs forms did not equal the total number of passengers on the flight manifest. A total of 218 customs forms (representing 280 passengers) were collected for the 335-passenger flight. We were able to determine the mismatch between Customs forms and the flight manifest only because we had requested a copy of the manifest before it was deleted from the airline's database; typically this is done 48 hours after the plane lands. [Retaining passenger manifests for longer than 48 hours is likely to be important for aircraft-related disease exposures not recognized prior to disembarkation.] Moreover, we determined that 18 passengers did not stay at the locations they had indicated on their Customs declaration form. Although these 18 people were ultimately contacted through tour agencies and investigative efforts, they would not have been reached if we had relied solely on these public. This approach would permit experienced medical consultation before passengers leave the terminal and would enhance opportunities to obtain complete contact information, provide counseling, or offer prophylaxis to passengers. Finally, as has been employed with limited success in combating the SARS outbreak, 10 efforts should be made to develop our global capacity for identifying potentially infectious individuals before international transit so that appropriate treatment and isolation procedures can be initiated before departure.",

First, the large difference observed in contact time between those staying in hotels vs. those not staying in hotels might be confounded by whether passengers were part of tour groups. People in tour groups usually stay together, and tour agencies typically have accurate information on their hotel arrangements. Another limitation is that we measured how long it took to notify passengers of their potential exposure, as opposed to how long it took to provide prophylactic vaccine or antibiotics. Although this approach might approximate the time required to get the passengers appropriate treatment or to isolate them, the additional time from notification to receipt of prophylaxis should be considered. Also, in the investigation reported here, public health agencies learned about a potential in-flight exposure when the ill patient was recognized in the air and diagnosed shortly after the plane landed. Alternatively, if illness in the index patient is not recognized for several days after disembarkation, the amount of time available to contact fellow passengers within the window for effective prophylaxis, isolation, or quarantine is reduced. Another limitation is that the time of notification was selfreported in many instances, and thus subject to reporting errors.",

In one such incident, a flight attendant, subsequently diagnosed with probable SARS in Taiwan, flew into Honolulu while experiencing a febrile prodrome. Her illness progressed overnight, but the following day she worked the outbound flight from Honolulu to Narita, Japan, potentially exposing the airline passengers she served. Upon being notified of her diagnosis, HDOH attempted to contact 108 passengers who had listed an address in Hawai'i as their destination for the original flight into Honolulu. We were able to contact only 68 passengers by telephone or site visits, so letters had to be sent to the remaining 40 passengers.",
