From rats, rat coronavirus (RCV) (7) and sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) (1) have been isolated. By intranasal inoculation RCV causes a fatal pneumonitis in newborn rats and SDAV induces sialodacryoadenitis in adult rats. They have been shown to share common antigen(s) with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). High incidences of antibody to MTIV in rat. colonies (2, 5) suggest that RCV and SDAV might be perpetuating in rat colonies without any apparent illness, while outbreaks of sialodacryoadenitis are common in laboratory rat colonies (4, 6, 9) , causing serious problems in breeding and experimentation.",

Jonas, Comparative Medicine, Yale University, New Heaven, U.S.A. The LBC cells, established from a spontaneous mammary tumor developed in a Lewis rat(3), were grown at 37 \u00b0 C in Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10 per cent fetal calf serum (FCS) and kanamycin (0.06 mg/ml). The FCS concentration was reduced to 5 per cent for maintaining the cells and harvesting the virus. The cell monolayers prepared in 50-ml culture bottles were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and inoculated with 0.2 ml of virus material. After virus adsorption at 37 \u00b0 C for 60 minutes, the inoculated cultures were fed 5 mt of mMntenanee medium and incubated at 37 \u00b0 C.Cytopathie change was first detected on infected cultures at 48 hours postinoculation (p.i.), and 72 hours p.i. syneytia appeared as reported on infected primary culture of rat kidney cells (1). Passages of SDAV in LBC cell monolayers were readily carried out at intervals of 3 days with undiluted culture fluid. After 6 passages much more remarkable CPE developed within 21 hours p.i. CPE induced by SDAV in LBC cells consists of syncytia and their detachment from the glass surface(Figs. 1A and i B). The infectivity of infected culture fluid was estimated by inoculation into LBC cells prepared in 13 \u00d7 100 mm test tubes, showing t07.0 50 per cent tissue culture infective doses (TCIDso)/0.2 ml at the 10th passage level.The LBC cell monolayers grown in coverslips were inoculated with the virus passaged 10 times on LBC cells, fixed at 24 hours p. i. with cold acetone. The fixed samples were treated with anti-SDAV rat serum (1 : 10) supplied by A. M. Jonas at 37 \u00b0 C for 60 minutes, and then overlMd with fluoreseein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgG rabbit serum (Miles Biochemieals, U.S.A.) (1 : t0) at 37 \u00b0 C for 60 minutes. Strong fluorescence was demonstrated within cytoplasm, espeeiMly in perinuclear area of syncytia(Fig. 2), as reported on replication of I~CV in LBC cells (3).",
