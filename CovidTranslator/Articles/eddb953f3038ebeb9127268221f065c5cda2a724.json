The prevalence, characteristics and methods of suicidal behaviour vary widely between different communities, in different demographic groups and over time. Consequently up-to-date surveillance of suicides and suicide attempts is an essential component of national and local suicide prevention efforts. Suicide is stigmatized (or illegal) in many countries. As a result, obtaining high-quality actionable data about suicidal behaviour is difficult, particularly in countries that do not have good vital registration systems (that register suicide deaths) or good data-collection systems on the provision of hospital services (that register medically treated suicide attempts).

Suicide registration is a complicated, multilevel procedure that includes medical and legal concerns and involves several responsible authorities that can vary from country to country. Suicides are most commonly found misclassified according to the codes of the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Conditions (ICD-10) as \"deaths of undetermined intent\" (ICD-10 codes Y10-Y34), and also as \"accidents\" (codes V01-X59), \"homicides\" (codes X85-Y09) and \"unknown cause\" (codes R95-R99) (4, 5, 6) . It is possible that the very wide range in estimated suicide rates reported for different countries and regions is an artefact of different reporting and recording practices. In the 60 countries with good vital registration systems there is a 32-fold range in national age-adjusted suicide rates for 2012 (from 0.89 to 28.85 per 100 000).

An epidemic in the use of barbecue charcoal to produce the highly toxic carbon monoxide gas as a means of suicide began in China, Hong Kong SAR in 1998 and rapidly spread to Taiwan, China where it became the most common method of suicide within eight years (9) . Other methods that have recently become popular in some locations include mixing chemicals to produce hydrogen sulphide gas (e.g. in Japan) and the use of helium gas. These findings highlight the importance of ongoing monitoring of the methods employed in both suicide and suicide attempts in order to ensure that means restriction efforts and associated community educational efforts are responsive to the ever-changing patterns of suicide.

There is ample evidence of large differences in the rates and demographic characteristics of suicide between different locations within countries -e.g. between urban and rural areas of China (12) and between different states in India (13) . In this situation, national data do not help to determine the geographical regions or the demographic groups that should be prioritized for intervention efforts. National estimates of the proportions of all suicides by different methods provide a focus for national means restriction efforts, but these efforts often need to be adapted for different regions in each country.

Such factors include the literacy level of the population, the specific wording used in the questionnaire, the length of the questionnaire, the interpretation (i.e. the exact meaning and implications) of the wording in the local language, the time frame considered, and -most importantly -the extent to which respondents are willing to reveal this information.",

Comparison of self-reported rates of suicidal ideation across groups is particularly problematic because suicidal ideation is often a fleeting, fluctuating experience that is not observable by others. Moreover, comparison of self-reported lifetime rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attemptswhich may be of limited value in assessing the current risk of suicide -are also confounded by the different ages of respondents and by recall biases in remembering long-distant events. Thus, the most useful, and arguably the most reliable, measure generated by community-based self-report surveys is the occurrence of suicide attempts (that result in some level of physical injury) in the prior year.",

The available report on the 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts among individuals 18 years of age and older (collected in studies conducted from 2001 to 2007) is based on data from 10 high-income countries (nine used nationally representative samples) with a combined sample of 52 484 individuals, six middle-income countries (four used nationally representative samples) with a combined sample of 25 666 individuals, and five low-income countries (one used a nationally representative sample) with a combined sample of 31 227 individuals (19) . The reported prevalence of having made one or more suicide attempts in the prior year was 3 per 1000 individuals (i.e. 0.3%) in both males and females from high-income countries, 3 per 1000 in males and 6 per 1000 in females from middle-income countries, and 4 per 1000 in both males and females from low-income countries. Applying the prevalence in high-income, middle-income and low-income countries to the adult populations (i.e. 18 years and above) of all countries in each of these World Bank income strata, the estimated global annual prevalence of self-reported suicide attempt is approximately 4 per 1000 adults. Given the estimated 2012 global suicide rate of 15.4 per 100 000 adults of 18 years and over, this would indicate that for each adult who died of suicide there were likely to be more than 20 others who made one or more suicide attempts. However, as is the case for the rates of suicide and suicide attempts, there is wide variation in the attempt-to-death ratio and in the case fatality rate of suicidal behaviour by region, sex, age and method.",

In these settings, providing training and equipment to local medical personnel is an essential component of the suicide prevention effort (27) .

The purpose of this national registry is to determine and monitor the incidence and repetition of self-harm presentations to hospital emergency departments with the aim of identifying high-incidence groups and areas, and informing services and practitioners concerned with the prevention of suicidal behaviour (20, 21) . There are multiple contributing factors and causal pathways to suicide and a range of options for its prevention. Usually no single cause or stressor is sufficient to explain a suicidal act. Most commonly, several risk factors act cumulatively to increase an individual's vulnerability to suicidal behaviour. At the same time, the presence of risk factors does not necessarily lead to suicidal behaviour; not everyone with a mental disorder, for instance, dies from suicide. Effective interventions are imperative as they can mitigate the risk factors identified. Protective factors are equally important and have been identified as improving resilience. Therefore, enhancing protective factors is also an important aim of any comprehensive suicide prevention response.",

Effective mental health awareness campaigns focus on only one or two disorders, using different types of exposure (e.g. television, print media, Internet, social media, posters) in order to reinforce the messages, appropriately adapting messages, combining several strategies, and organizing programmes at local level by targeting specific populations (62, 63).",

The protective value of religion and spirituality may arise from providing access to a socially cohesive and supportive community with a shared set of values.

Good self-esteem, self-efficacy and effective problem solving-skills, which include the ability to seek help when needed, can mitigate the impact of stressors and childhood adversities (135) .

As mental disorders are widely stigmatized, people (and especially males) may be reluctant to seek help. People who are unlikely to seek help can compound their mental health problems, increasing the risk of suicide that may otherwise have been effectively prevented through early intervention.

Suicide is a major public health problem worldwide but it is preventable.

Health ministries play a central role in government efforts to reduce suicide. However, reducing suicide nationally must be a multisectoral effort in order to be effective.

When suicide is considered a criminal act, suicide attempts are often hidden and suicide deaths are unreported, thus giving the false impression that suicidal behaviours are less prevalent. All countries should review their legal provisions in relation to suicide to ensure they do not deter people from seeking help. Establishing a country's national response to suicide prevention presents an opportunity to tackle the task of preventing suicides across the world in a way that is meaningful to a country's context. Regardless of where a country currently stands in terms of commitment to and resources for suicide prevention, the process of establishing a national response itself can improve prevention. The creation of a national response provides a rallying point for bringing together a diversity of stakeholders in suicide prevention and for building on their expertise through a participatory approach. The result is a convergence of stakeholders from government, NGOs, and health and non-health sectors that can contribute to country-specific, national long-term strategies that follow a public health model.

Following this, the driving force for suicide prevention shifted from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare to the Cabinet Office, and suicide prevention became an overarching government policy that was not limited to a single ministry. In 2007, the \"General principles of suicide prevention\" policy was enacted, aimed at preventing suicide and providing support to survivors. Underlying it was the philosophy that a suicide prevention policy would help build a society in which citizens live purposeful lives, and various responsibilities were attributed to the state. The principles of the Basic Act reflect the idea that suicide prevention activities should take account of the complexity of suicide-related factors and should not only focus on mental disorders. Thus, suicide prevention activities should include prevention, intervention and postvention, with close cooperation between stakeholders.",
