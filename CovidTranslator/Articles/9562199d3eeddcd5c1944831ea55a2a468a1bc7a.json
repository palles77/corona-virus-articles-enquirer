Among such methods, Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method has some advantages to be applied for point-of-care test (POCT) [11] . Well optimized LAMP assay shows sensitivity comparable to that of PCR, less than 10 copies per reaction [12] . Intercalating fluorescent dyes are compatible with LAMP reaction so that we can observe amplification in real-time [13] . Because amplification efficiency of LAMP reaction is very high, changes in reaction mixture components made it possible to detect the result with colorimetric detection methods [14] [15] [16] . Moreover, unpurified sample can be directly used for LAMP [17] [18] [19] . This indicates that high-throughput test is possible when use of unpurified specimen is combined with noninstrumental (e.g. colorimetric) detection.",

For RT-LAMP, 10 U of SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added. For end-point colorimetric detection of LAMP reaction, tweaked version of 5x stock LCV solution[15] containing 0.5 mM Crystal Violet (Sigma, C0775), 60 mM Sodium Sulfite (Sigma, S0505) and 5 mM \u03b2-Cyclodextrin (Sigma, C4767) was directly added to LAMP reaction mixture to 1x concentration. When using WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (NEB), same concentrations of primers and 0.4 \u03bcM SYTO-9 were added. Isothermal incubation and fluorescence signal measurement was performed using LightCycler 96 instrument (Roche) at 69\u2103 with additional heat inactivation (5 minutes at 95\u2103) and melting curve analysis steps. Fluorescence signals were measured for every minute during 60 (screening and optimization) or 30 (Limit of Detection and cross-reactivity) minutes of incubation.
