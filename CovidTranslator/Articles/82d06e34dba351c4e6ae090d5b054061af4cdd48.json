Respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus), enteroviruses (including coxsackievirus and echovirus), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are frequent causes of pharyngitis. EBV pharyngitis often is accompanied by other clinical findings of infectious mononucleosis (e.g., generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly), and can be exudative and indistinguishable from GAS pharyngitis. HSV pharyngitis often is associated with stomatitis in children, and tends to affect the entire oral mucosa including the gingival, buccal mucosa, and tongue. Enteroviral pharyngitis can be an isolated finding (herpangina), or part of the spectrum of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and has a typical appearance. Systemic infections with other viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, and measles virus) also can include pharyngitis.",

Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a rare cause in adolescents and Neisseria gonorrhoeae can cause acute pharyngitis in sexually active adolescents. Other bacteria such as Francisella tularensis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae as well as mixed infections with anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Vincent angina) are rare causes. Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been implicated rarely, particularly in adults. Although other bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae frequently are isolated from throat cultures of children and adolescents with acute pharyngitis, their etiologic role is not established. Fusobacterium necrophorum, the typical etiologic agent of Lemierre syndrome, also may cause uncomplicated pharyngitis. 2 Non-infectious cases of recurrent or prolonged pharyngitis and sore throat include the periodic fever, adenitis, pharyngitis, and aphthous ulcers (PFAPA) syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux and/or laryngopharyngeal reflux, and allergic rhinitis.

A community-wide outbreak of pharyngitis in children was described in which GGS was isolated from 25% of 222 consecutive children with acute pharyngitis seen in a private pediatric office; results of DNA fingerprinting suggested that 75% of isolates belonged to the same GGS clone. 7 The role of GCS and GGS in acute pharyngitis may be underestimated. Laboratories may use bacitracin susceptibility to identify GAS; many GCS and GGS are bacitracin-resistant. Additionally, rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) recognize the GAS cell wall carbohydrate, but are nonreactive with GCS or GGS. 8",

In contrast, the empiric strategy proposed in the CDC/AAFP/ACP-ASIM guidelines resulted in the administration of unnecessary antibiotics to an unacceptably large number of adults. Therefore, diagnosis of adults by symptomcomplex only has been discouraged by the latest AHA scientific statement. 16 ",

There have been only five reports of direct comparisons of different RADTs.

Investigators in a different pediatric group practice reviewed their experience with 11,427 RADTs performed between 1996 and 1999. 42 Only 2.4% of specimens negative by RADT were positive by culture. 42 A retrospective review of over 19,000 clinical RADTs performed in a heterogeneous inpatient and outpatient group demonstrated a negative predictive value (NPV) ranging from 90% to 96% and a maximum sensitivity of 77% to 86%. 39 Physicians electing to use any RADT in children and adolescents without culture backup of negative results should do so only after demonstrating with adequate sample size calculation that the RADT is as sensitive as throat culture in their own practice. 14, 15 Neither blood agar culture nor RADT accurately differentiates individuals with GAS pharyngitis from carriers. However, use facilitates withholding antimicrobial therapy in the great majority of macrolide-resistant. 71 During a longitudinal investigation of GAS disease in a single elementary school in Pittsburgh, investigators found that 48% of isolates of GAS collected between 2000 and 2001 were resistant to erythromycin; none was resistant to clindamycin. 72 Molecular typing indicated that this outbreak was due to a single strain of GAS. Clinicians should be aware of local resistance rates.",

Corticosteroids are recommended for EBV pharyngitis only when tonsillar enlargement threatens airway patency. 15 Several reviews of the large group of heterogeneous studies of use of corticosteroids for GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis conclude a small but measurable benefit in pain reduction, especially when initiated early in the course of severe illness.

Although the use of cephalosporins for GAS pharyngitis could reduce the number of persons (especially chronic carriers) who harbor GAS after completing therapy, empiric first-line use would be associated with substantial economic and possibly ecologic cost. There are compelling reasons (e.g., its narrow antimicrobial spectrum, low cost, and impressive safety profile) to continue to use penicillin as the drug of choice for uncomplicated GAS pharyngitis. Selected use of a first-generation cephalosporin as the drug of choice may be appropriate for patients at high risk of complications (such as a history of rheumatic fever), with severe symptoms, or with a suspected treatment failure or relapse.",

Several antimicrobial agents, including clarithromycin, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftibuten, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime, are effective in GAS eradication when administered for \u22645 days [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] and effective eradication with once-daily dosing has been described for amoxicillin, azithromycin, cefadroxil, cefixime, ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, cefprozil, and cefdinir. 14, 58, 61, [63] [64] [65] [66] However, the endpoints of these studies generally are eradication of GAS, not symptomatic improvement or prevention of rheumatic fever (the two main clinical reasons for treatment). In addition, many agents have a broader spectrum of activity and, even if administered for short courses, can be more expensive than standard therapy. 58 Therefore, additional studies are needed before these short-course or once daily-dose regimens can be recommended routinely. 14 Table 27 -2 gives recommendations for several regimens with proven efficacy for GAS pharyngitis. 14 Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is preferred in patients unlikely to complete a full 10-day course of therapy orally.",

In an investigation of 245 pharyngeal isolates and 56 invasive isolates of GAS obtained between 1994 and 1997 from 24 states and the District of Columbia, only 8 (2.6%) isolates were macrolideresistant. 51 A prospective, multicenter, U.S. community-based surveillance study of pharyngeal GAS isolates recovered from children 3 to 18 years of age during three successive respiratory seasons between 2000 and 2003 found macrolide resistance of <5% and clindamycin resistance of 1%, 70 and no evidence of increasing erythromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations over the 3-year study period. There was, however, considerable geographic variability in macrolide resistance rates in each study year, as well as year-to-year variability at individual study sites. 70 Higher resistance rates have been reported occasionally. For example, 9% of pharyngeal and 32% of invasive GAS strains collected in a San Francisco study during 1994 to 1995 were difficult problem for the practicing physician. The fundamental question is whether this patient is experiencing repeated episodes of GAS pharyngitis or is a GAS carrier experiencing repeated episodes of viral pharyngitis. The latter situation is by far the more common. Such a patient is likely to be a GAS carrier if: (1) clinical and epidemiologic findings suggest a viral etiology; (2) there is little clinical response to appropriate antimicrobial therapy; (3) throat culture (or RADT) is positive between episodes of pharyngitis; and (4) there is no serologic response to GAS extracellular antigen (e.g., ASO, anti-deoxyribonucleases B). In contrast, the patient with repeated episodes of acute pharyngitis associated with positive throat cultures (or RADTs) for GAS is likely to be experiencing repeated episodes of bona fide GAS pharyngitis if:",

If determined that the patient is experiencing repeated episodes of true GAS pharyngitis, some physicians have suggested use of prophylactic oral penicillin V. However, the efficacy of this regimen has not been proven, and antimicrobial prophylaxis is not recommended except to prevent recurrences of rheumatic fever in patients who have experienced a previous episode of rheumatic fever. Tonsillectomy may be considered in the rare patient whose symptomatic episodes do not diminish in frequency over time and in whom no alternative explanation for the recurrent GAS pharyngitis is evident. However, tonsillectomy has been demonstrated to be beneficial for a relatively small group of these patients, and any benefit is relatively short-lived. 83, 84 COMPLICATIONS GAS pharyngitis can be associated with suppurative and nonsuppurative complications (See Chapter 118, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A Streptococcus). Suppurative complications result from the spread of GAS to adjacent structures and include peritonsillar abscess, para-and retropharyngeal abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, sinusitis, otitis media, and mastoiditis. Before antimicrobial agents were available, suppurative complications of GAS pharyngitis were common; however, antimicrobial therapy has greatly reduced the frequency of such complications.",

            "text": "clinical treatment failure (usually defined as persistent or recurrent signs or symptoms suggestive of GAS pharyngitis) is difficult to determine without repeated isolation of the infecting strain of GAS (i.e., true bacteriologic treatment failure). Bacteriologic treatment failures can be classified as either true or apparent. True bacteriologic failure refers to the inability to eradicate the specific strain of GAS causing an acute episode of pharyngitis with a complete course of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. No penicillin-resistant strains of GAS have ever been identified. The following factors have been suggested but not established definitively: (1) penicillin tolerance (i.e., a discordance between the concentration of penicillin required to inhibit and to kill the organisms); 78, 79 (2) enhancement of colonization and growth of GAS by pharyngeal flora or inactivation of penicillin by production of \u03b2-lactamases; 67 (3) resistance of intracellular organisms to antimicrobial killing. 80 Apparent bacteriologic failure can occur when newly acquired GAS isolates are mistaken for the original infecting strain, when the infecting strain of GAS is eradicated but then rapidly reacquired, or when adherence to antimicrobial therapy is poor. However, most bacteriologic treatment failures are manifestations of the GAS carrier state. Chronic carriers have GAS in their pharynx but no clinical illness or immunologic response to the organism, can be colonized for 6 to \u226512 months, are unlikely to spread GAS to close contacts, and are at very low (if any) risk for developing suppurative or nonsuppurative complications. 81, 82 During the winter and spring in temperate climates, as many as 20% of asymptomatic school-aged children carry GAS. 81 GAS carriers should not be given antimicrobial therapy; the primary approach to the suspected or confirmed carrier is reassurance. A throat culture or RADT should be performed whenever the patient has symptoms and signs suggestive of GAS pharyngitis, but should be avoided when symptoms are more typical of viral illnesses (see . Each clinical episode confirmed with a positive throat culture or RADT should be treated. Identification and eradication of the streptococcal carrier state are desirable in certain specific situations. When antimicrobial therapy is employed, oral clindamycin (20 mg/kg per day up to 450 mg, divided into 3 doses) for 10 days is preferred, 51 but intramuscular benzathine penicillin (alone or in combination with procaine penicillin) plus oral rifampin (20 mg/kg per day divided into 2 doses; maximum dose, 300 mg for 4 days beginning on the day of the penicillin injection) 37 also is effective. Chronic carriage can recur upon re-exposure to GAS.",
