            "text": "Eukaryotic ribosomal frameshift signals generally contain two elements, a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (XXXYYYN) and an RNA secondary structure, often an RNA pseudoknot, located downstream. Frameshifting takes place at the slippery sequence by simultaneous slippage of two ribosome-bound tRNAs. All of the tRNAs that are predicted to decode frameshift sites in the ribosomal A-site (XXXYYYN) possess a hypermodi-\u00aeed base in the anticodon-loop and it is conceivable that these modi\u00aecations play a role in the frameshift process. To test this, we expressed slippery sequence variants of the coronavirus IBV frameshift signal in strains of Escherichia coli unable to modify fully either tRNA Lys or tRNA Asn . At the slippery sequences UUUAAAC and UUUAAAU (underlined codon decoded by tRNA Asn , anticodon 5 H QUU 3 H ), frameshifting was very inef\u00aecient (2 to 3%) and in strains de\u00aecient in the biosynthesis of Q base, was increased (AAU) or decreased (AAC) only two-fold. In E. coli, therefore, hypomodi\u00aecation of tRNA Asn had little effect on frameshifting. The situation with the ef\u00aecient slippery sequences UUUAAAA (15%) and UUUAAAG (40%) (underlined codon decoded by tRNA Lys , anticodon 5 H mnm 5 s 2 UUU 3 H ) was more complex, since the wobble base of tRNA Lys is modi\u00aeed at two positions. Of four available mutants, only trmE (s 2 UUU) had a marked in\u00afuence on frameshifting, increasing the ef\u00aeciency of the process at the slippery sequence UUUAAAA. No effect on frameshifting was seen in trmC1 (cmnm 5 s 2 UUU) or trmC2 (nm 5 s 2 UUU) strains and only a very small reduction (at UUUAAAG) was observed in an asuE (mnm 5 UUU) strain. The slipperiness of tRNA Lys , therefore, cannot be ascribed to a single modi\u00aecation site on the base. However, the data support a role for the amino group of the mnm 5 substitution in shaping the anticodon structure. Whether these conclusions can be extended to eukaryotic translation systems is uncertain. Although E. coli ribosomes changed frame at the IBV signal (UUUAAAG) with an ef\u00aeciency similar to that measured in reticulocyte lysates (40%), there were important qualitative differences. Frameshifting of prokaryotic ribosomes was pseudoknot-independent (although secondary structure dependent) and appeared to require slippage of only a single tRNA.",

            "text": "Several viruses use an ef\u00aecient \u00c01 ribosomal frameshifting mechanism to control expression of their replicases. Frameshifts of this class were \u00aerst described as the process by which the gagpol polyprotein of the retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is expressed from the overlapping gag and pol open reading frames (ORFs: Jacks & Varmus, 1985) . Related frameshift signals have since been documented in an increasing number of systems, including several other retroviruses, a number of eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses, a double-stranded RNA virus of yeast, some plant RNA viruses and certain bacteriophage (reviewed by Brierley, 1995) . The phenomenon is not restricted to viruses; frameshift signals of the``retrovirus type'' have been described in a number of Escherichia coli insertion elements (reviewed by Chandler & Fayet, 1993; Farabaugh, 1996) and in a conventional cellular gene, the dna X gene of E. coli (Blinkowa & Walker, 1990; Flower & McHenry, 1990; Tsuchihashi & Kornberg, 1990; Tsuchihashi, 1991) . The mRNA signals that specify frameshifting appear to be composed of two essential elements; a heptanucleotide``slippery'' sequence, where the ribosome changes reading frame, and a region of RNA secondary structure, often in the form of an RNA pseudoknot, located a few nucleotides downstream (Jacks et al., 1988a; Brierley et al., 1989; ten Dam et al., 1990) . The molecular mechanism of the frameshift process is only poorly understood, but work from several groups supports a model (Jacks et al., 1988a) in which the elongating ribosome pauses upon encountering the region of mRNA secondary structure, facilitating realignment of the slippery sequence-decoding tRNAs in the \u00c01 frame. The heptanucleotide stretch that forms the slippery sequence contains two homopolymeric triplets and conforms, in the vast majority of cases, to the motif XXXYYYN. Frameshifting at this sequence is thought to occur by simultaneous slippage of two ribosome-bound tRNAs, presumably peptidyl and aminoacyl tRNAs, which are translocated from the zero (X XXY YYN) to the \u00c01 phase (XXX YYY: Jacks et al., 1988a) . Following the slip, the tRNAs remain base-paired to the mRNA in at least two out of three anticodon positions. There is considerable experimental support for this model, particularly from site-directed mutagenesis studies (Jacks et al., 1988a; Dinman et al., 1991; Dinman & Wickner, 1992; Brierley et al., 1992) , sequencing of trans-frame proteins (Hizi et al., 1987; Jacks et al., 1988a,b; Weiss et al., 1989; Nam et al., 1993) and nucleotide sequence comparisons (Jacks et al., 1988a; ten Dam et al., 1990) . The protein sequencing studies indicate that the frameshift occurs at the second codon of the tandem slippery pair, i.e. at that codon decoded in the ribosomal aminoacyl (A) site (XXXYYYN). The importance of the A-site tRNA in frameshift-ing was also apparent from the mutagenesis studies; point mutations affecting the A-site tRNA were generally more inhibitory than those affecting the P-site tRNA.",

            "text": "A key question that has remained unanswered is whether frameshifting at the slippery sequence is mediated by canonical tRNAs, or requires the participation of special``shifty'' tRNAs, more prone to frameshift than their``normal'' counterparts (Jacks et al., 1988a) . At naturally occurring frameshift sites, of the codons that are decoded in the ribosomal A-site prior to tRNA slippage (XXXYYYN), only \u00aeve are represented in eukaryotes, AAC, AAU, UUA, UUC and UUU, and two in prokaryotes, AAA and AAG (Farabaugh, 1996) . These codons are decoded by tRNAs with a highly modi\u00aeed base in the anticodon loop (see Hat\u00aeeld et al., 1992 and references therein) . In tRNA Asn (AAC, AAU), the wobble base is queuosine (Q), in tRNA Phe (UUC, UUU), wyebutoxine (Y) is present just 3 H of the anticodon, in tRNA Lys (AAA, AAG), the wobble base is 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm 5 s 2 U) (prokaryotes) and in tRNA Leu (UUA), 2-methyl-5-formylcytidine is present at the wobble position (Debarros et al., 1996) . Hat\u00aeeld et al. (1992) have suggested that hypomodi\u00aeed variants of these tRNAs may exist that function as speci\u00aec``shifty'' tRNAs, since such variants will have a considerably less bulky anticodon and be more free to move around at the decoding site. Indirect support for this hypothesis comes from an examination of the modi\u00aecation status of the anticodons of the aminoacyl-tRNAs that are required for translation at and around the frameshift sites of human immunode\u00aeciency virus type 1 (HIV-1), human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-1) and bovine leukaemia virus (BLV: Hat\u00aeeld et al., 1989) . It was found that in HIV-1 infected cells, most of the tRNA Phe lacked Y and in HTLV-1 and BLV infected cells, most of the tRNA Asn lacked Q. However, research from other groups has suggested an alternative hypothesis, in which frameshifting is mediated by standard cellular tRNAs (Tsuchihashi, 1991; Tsuchihashi & Brown, 1992; Brierley et al., 1992) . These authors propose that frameshifting at a particular site depends, amongst other parameters, upon the strength of the interaction between the slippery sequence codons and the tRNAs decoding it and that if this interaction is relatively weak, then slippage is more likely to occur. The strength of the interaction between mRNA and tRNA is likely to be in\u00afuenced considerably by the kind of base-pair that forms between the 3 H base of the codon and the 5 H base of the anticodon (position 34) at the wobble position. Modi\u00aecation of the anticodon wobble base of frameshift site-decoding tRNAs may well in\u00afuence this interaction and hence the level of frameshifting observed. A prediction of the hypothesis is that the anticodon modi\u00aecations present in tRNAs that decode highly ef\u00aecient slippery sequences reduce recognition of the corresponding codons.",

            "text": "Here, we have attempted to test these hypotheses by measuring directly the in\u00afuence of tRNA anticodon modi\u00aecation on frameshifting. Our approach was to determine the ef\u00aeciency of the frameshift signal of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; Brierley et al., 1987 Brierley et al., , 1989 in mutant strains of Escherichia coli unable to modify fully either tRNA Lys or tRNA Asn . The IBV frameshift signal, which is present at the overlap of the 1a and 1b ORFs of the virus genomic RNA, is a well-characterised eukaryotic system (Brierley et al., 1991 (Brierley et al., , 1992 ) that comprises the slippery sequence UUUAAAC and a downstream RNA pseudoknot. We began by determining the components of the IBV signal required for ef\u00aecient frameshifting in E. coli and then proceeded with the investigation of the role of tRNA anticodon modi\u00aecation in frameshifting. Four slippery sequence variants of the IBV site (UUUAAAX, where X was A, C, G or U) were tested, focusing speci\u00aecally on the A-site decoding tRNAs. The results obtained indicate that in E. coli there is little in\u00afuence of the tRNA modi\u00aecation status on frameshifting. Hypomodi\u00aecation of tRNA Asn had only a slight effect on frameshifting and of the tRNA Lys mutants tested, only trmE (anticodon s 2 UUU) had a marked in\u00afuence, increasing the ef\u00aeciency of the process at the slippery sequence UUUAAAA.",

            "text": "The ef\u00aeciency of frameshift signals of the IBV type in the eukaryotic rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) in vitro translation system has been shown to be in\u00afuenced by the nature of the slippery sequence, the integrity of the downstream RNA structure and the precise spacing between the two elements (Brierley et al., 1991 (Brierley et al., , 1992 . We began by con\u00aerming that these requirements were maintained in E. coli. Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) containing variants of the IBV signal were subcloned (see Materials and Methods) into the E. coli expression vector pET3xc (Studier et al., 1990) to create the pMM series of plasmids (see Figure 1 ). pET3xc contains the \u00aerst 783 bp of coding sequence of the bacteriophage T7 gene 10,\u00afanked by a T7 promoter and transcription termination signal. In E. coli BL21 cells, which contain an IPTG-inducible T7 RNA polymerase, a 261 amino acid residue portion of gene 10 is expressed from pET3xc as an abundant, Triton-insoluble product that is relatively easy to purify (see Materials and Methods). In the pMM plasmids, the IBV cDNAs were cloned in frame with and downstream of the gene 10 sequence of pET3xc at a unique BamHI site. In BL21 cells, these constructs were predicted to express a 33 kDa non-frameshifted product corresponding to ribosomes that terminated at the IBV 1a stop codon and a 50 kDa frameshift product from ribosomes which frameshifted prior to encountering the stop codon and continued to translate the 1b ORF in the \u00c01 frame. The constructs tested are shown in Figure 2 , the expressions in Figure 3 and the results are summarised in Table 2 . For the pET3xc plasmid, which does not contain an IBV insertion, only two major species were present, the N-terminal portion of gene 10, with an apparent molecular mass of about 34 kDa and lysozyme, carried over from the puri\u00aecation procedure (see Materials and Methods). For the pMM expressions, three species were seen; lysozyme, a 36 kDa species corresponding to the non-frameshifted product and for most constructs, a 50 kDa frameshift product. The identity of the 36 kDa and 50 kDa proteins was con\u00aermed by demonstrating that both proteins reacted in Western blots with a monoclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of gene 10 (AMS Biotechnology Ltd, Europe; data not shown). We also con\u00aermed that the 36 kDa and 50 kDa proteins were restricted to the insoluble fraction of E. coli cell extracts; no soluble non-frameshifted or frameshifted protein was detected (data not shown). Figure 1 . The basic plasmids used in this study, the pMM series, were prepared by subcloning 585 bp NheI-EcoRI fragments containing the IBV frameshift region from plasmids pFS7, pFS8 or mutant derivatives (Brierley et al., 1989 (Brierley et al., , 1991 into BamHI-cleaved, plasmid pET3xc (Studier et al., 1990) . Both fragment(s) and vector were end-\u00aelled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I prior to ligation with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting plasmids contain the IBV ORF 1a/1b frameshift signal (sequence information from base-pairs 12,286 to 12,511; Boursnell et al., 1987) \u00afanked by portions of the in\u00afuenza A/PR8/34 PB1 gene (sequence information from base-pairs 1140 to 1167 (5 H ) and 1167 to 1500 (3 H ); Young et al., 1983 ) located downstream of, and in frame with, the \u00aerst 783 bp of coding sequence of the bacteriophage T7 gene 10. The ensemble is under the control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter and a T7 transcription termination signal is present at the end of the coding sequences. In the relevant T7-expressing bacteria (see Materials and Methods), the constructs are predicted to express a 33 kDa non-frameshifted product, corresponding to ribosomes that terminate at the IBV 1a stop codon and a 50 kDa frameshift product from ribosomes that frameshift prior to encountering the stop codon and continue to translate the 1b ORF in the \u00c01 frame.",

            "text": "The generality of the simultaneous slippage model of frameshifting for sites expressed in E. coli is not fully established. It was important, therefore, to determine whether frameshifting at the IBV slippery sequence in E. coli deviated from the conventional simultaneous slippage mechanism ascertained in RRL. We created a series of mutations at or around the IBV slippery sequence and tested for frameshifting by expression in E. coli BL21 (see Figure 3A ). The wild-type IBV slippery sequence, UUUAAAC (pMM1), decoded by tRNA Asn (anticodon 5 H QUU 3 H ) stimulated only low-levels of frameshifting (2%), as did UUUAAAU (pMM8, 3%). In E. coli, therefore, tRNA Asn is considerably less slippery than it is in eukaryotic cells or the RRL (Brierley et al., 1989) . In contrast, tRNA Lys (anticodon 5 H U 8 UU 3 H ; where U 8 is mnm 5 s 2 U), which reads UUUAAAA (pMM9) and UUUAAAG (pMM2), was highly slippery; frameshifting at these sites occurring with great ef\u00aeciency (15% and 40%, respectively). The slipperiness of E. coli tRNA Lys has been documented and will be discussed in detail later. In E. coli the hierarchy of frameshifting for the seventh nucleotide of the slippery sequence (UUUAAAN) was N G > A4U C. This is almost the reverse of the situation seen in RRL, where the hierarchy for N is C > A U4G (Brierley et al., 1992) , and is consistent with earlier studies of frameshifting in E. coli (Weiss et al., 1989; Tsuchihashi & Brown, 1992) . The introduction of different termination codons (UGA, pMM24; UAG, pMM27; UAA, pMM28) or an alternative sense codon (UGG, pMM25) immediately downstream of the slippery sequence had little effect on frameshifting, although a discernible reduction was seen with the UAG (32%) and UGA (29%) terminators. By\u00afanking the slippery sequence with termination codons (pMM26), one immediately downstream (UGA) in the zero phase and a second immediately upstream (UAA) in the \u00c01 phase, we were able to con\u00aerm that frameshifting takes place within the UUUAAAG stretch ( Figure 3B ). As with pMM27, we observed a slight reduction in frameshift ef\u00aeciency with this construct, which had UAG as the downstream termination codon (see Discussion). We also introduced mutations within the slippery sequence. Unsurprisingly, the sequence UUUA-CAG (pMM30) was non-functional, since his mutation would prevent slippage of the A-site decoding tRNA. However a P-site mutation, UCUAAAG (pMM29) was fully competent in frameshifting, suggesting that in the case of the IBV signal in E. coli, the process does not involve simultaneous slippage of two tRNAs, but rather \u00c01 slippage of a single tRNA Lys (from AAG to AAA). Puri\u00aeed proteins expressed from the relevant frameshift plasmids were separated on SDS 15% polyacrylamide gels and detected by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue R as described in Materials and Methods.

            "text": "Ef\u00aecient frameshifting at the IBV signal, at least in the RRL, depends upon the RNA pseudoknot structure, which cannot be replaced functionally by a stable stem \u00b1loop structure of the same predicted size and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot (Brierley et al., 1991) . We investigated whether the RNA secondary structure requirements for frameshifting in E. coli were conserved by measuring the frameshift ef\u00aeciency of a series of pseudoknot mutants (see Figures 2 and 3) . Complete removal of the pseudoknot dramatically reduced frameshifting, irrespective of whether the slippery sequence was UUUAAAC (pMM6) or UUUAAAG (pMM5). The pattern of frameshifting observed for mutations within the pseudoknot closely paralleled that seen in the RRL, in that destabilization of either stem of the pseudoknot reduced frameshifting ef\u00aeciency (pMM3, 12, 13, 15, 20, 21 in stem 1; pMM4, 17, 18 in stem 2) and compensatory mutations predicted to restore the structure in general increased frameshifting (pMM16, 22 in stem 1; pMM19 in stem 2). Of the compensatory mutants in stem 1, two of the three analysed had frameshift ef\u00aeciencies considerably below that seen for the wild-type structure (pMM14, 12% and pMM16, 20%). This is a phenomenon that has been observed in a number of studies of eukaryotic frameshifting (see ten Dam et al., 1995) and may reect a functional requirement for a particular pseudoknot conformation that is imprecisely reproduced in some of the compensatory mutants. The ef\u00aeciencies of frameshifting measured for the stem 2 point mutations (pMM4, 15%; pMM17, 15% and pMM18, 9%) were considerably greater than that seen previously in RRL, where frameshifting in these mutants is reduced to about 5% (Brierley et al., 1991) . This supports the idea that ef\u00aecient frameshifting in E. coli can be mediated by simple hairpin loop stimulators. Indeed, in construct pMM23, which contains the potential for formation of only stem 1, frameshifting occurred ef\u00aeciently (22%). Moreover, when the pseudoknot of pMM2 was replaced by a large stem \u00b1 loop structure of the same predicted size and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot (pMM7), frameshifting occurred at a high level in E. coli cells (32%), in contrast to the situation in RRL, where such a structure promotes only low levels (1 to 2%) of frameshifting. This observation highlights an important difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes in terms of their response to RNA stimulators associated with frameshift sites. A similarity that is maintained, however, is the necessity for precise spacing between the stimulatory structure and the slippery sequence. As in the RRL (Brierley et al., 1989) , increasing (pMM11) or decreasing (pMM10) the spacing distance by three nucleotides greatly reduced frameshifting at the IBV site in E. coli.",

In these experiments, T7 RNA polymerase was provided by infecting cells with bacteriophage l CE6 (see Materials and Methods), which contains the gene for T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the P L and P I promoters. Under these circumstances, we found that expression levels were generally lower than those seen upon IPTG-induction of BL21 cells and were in\u00afuenced by the growth-rate of the cells (re\u00afecting the ef\u00aeciency of the l CE6 infection).

In these strains, Q is not incorporated into tRNA and tRNA Asn has the anticodon 5 H GUU 3 H .

This was not a problem with the asuE strain; the level of mnm 5 Se 2 U has been measured in an asuE strain and was not detected (Kramer & Ames, 1988) . Previous studies, however, have indicated that selenium is not detectably incorporated into tRNA when bacteria are cultured in minimal medium (Wittwer & Stadtman, 1986) . Although these authors have suggested that this is also the case for LB medium, we decided to measure frameshifting in the trmC1, trmC2 and trmE strains during culture in a de\u00aened minimal medium prepared from chemicals of high purity in addition to assays in standard LB medium. The results of the analysis are shown in Figure 5 and are summarised in Table 2 . The signal to noise ratio in the minimal medium assays was increased somewhat as a consequence of the slower growth-rate of the strains. The asuE strain ( Figure 5B ) grew very slowly in minimal medium and was only tested in LB medium. The frameshift ef\u00aeciencies measured for the various mutants were not in\u00afuenced by the growth medium. No effect on frameshifting was seen in the trmC1 or trmC2 strains when either the UUUAAAA or UUUAAAG-containing test plasmids were expressed. The most noticeable in\u00afuence was in the trmE strain, where frameshifting was stimulated over twofold (from 15% to 32%) at the UUUAAAA site and also increased at the UUUAAAG site, although to a lesser extent (from 40% to 48%). These increases were seen in two independent trmE strains (TH78, DEV 16). Frameshifting in the asuE background was unaltered at the UUUAAAA site but was reduced a little at the UUUAAAG site (from 40% to 33%).",

            "text": "The generality of the simultaneous slippage model of frameshifting for sites expressed in E. coli is not fully established. Weiss et al. (1989) have expressed a variant of the MMTV frameshift signal in E. coli and have shown that ribosomes respond to both of the tandem slippery codons of the MMTV frameshift signal as predicted by the simultaneous slippage model. At the frameshift signal of the E. coli dnaX gene, mutagenesis of the slippery sequence (A-AAA-AAG) has con\u00aermed that both lysine codons are required for ef\u00aecient frameshifting (Tsuchihashi & Brown, 1992) . Similarly, frameshifting at the G-T ORF overlap required to produce a bacteriophage l tail assembly protein occurs by a two tRNA slip (Levin et al., 1993) . However, in the E. coli insertion element IS1, frameshifting is known to occur by \u00c01 slippage of a single lysyl tRNA at the sequence A-AAA (from the underlined codon onto the overlapping AAA codon), despite the fact that the A 4 stretch is embedded within two potential and conventional slippery sequences (U-UUA-AAA-AAC; Sekine & Ohtsubo, 1992 ). An unexpected \u00aending from our analysis of the slippery sequence requirements for IBV frameshifting in E. coli was the high ef\u00aeciency of the UCUAAAG mutant (pMM29), since such a mutant has only low activity in RRL (Brierley et al., 1989) . The simplest explanation for this observation is that frameshifting at the IBV site in E. coli occurs by slippage of a single tRNA at the second homopolymeric triplet of the slippery sequence (UUUAAAX) rather than by simultaneous slippage of two tRNAs. The P-site codon in the mutant, UCUAAAG, is probably decoded by a minor tRNA Leu isoacceptor with anticodon 5 H UAG 3 H (Inokuchi & Yamao, 1995) . If this tRNA were to slip into the \u00c01 reading frame (in accordance with the simultaneous slippage model) it could form only a single G-U base-pair with the \u00c01 frame codon. At present, therefore, we favour single-tRNA slippage. Whether tRNA Lys slips when in the P or A-site of the ribosome is not know. Recent evidence supports the idea that frameshifting at the HIV-1 slippery sequence (U-UUU-UUA) in E. coli occurs not by simultaneous slippage of P and A-site-bound tRNAs, but when these tRNAs are in the ribosomal E and P-sites (Hors\u00aeeld et al., 1995) . This hypothesis was proposed following the discovery that the presence of a termination codon immediately downstream of the U 6 A stretch reduced frameshifting some \u00aeve-to tenfold in a manner that was independent of sequence context and could be modulated by prokaryotic release factor 2. These observations were consistent with the last six nucleotides of the slippery sequence occupying the E and P-sites and the termination codon the A-site prior to tRNA slippage. In the present study, we did detect a slight reduction in frameshift ef\u00aeciency when the downstream terminators UAG and UGA were employed, raising the possibility that a fraction of the frameshift events monitored involve the E-site; but the data are most consistent with the slippery sequence occupying the standard P and A-sites. This conclusion is supported by the fact that, as is also seen in RRL (Brierley et al., 1989 (Brierley et al., , 1992 , the spacing distance between the slippery sequence and pseudoknot had to be maintained at six nucleotides for ef\u00aecient frameshifting to occur. Protein sequencing studies and further mutagenesis experiments are in progress in an attempt to improve our understanding of the precise mechanism of tRNA slippage at the IBV site in E. coli.",

            "text": "The requirements for downstream RNA secondary structure were tested in constructs with the most ef\u00aecient (UUUAAAG) slippery sequence, using a series of complementary and compensatory pseudoknot mutants. The response of prokaryotic ribosomes to these mutants was generally similar to that seen with the eukaryotic ribosomes of the RRL in vitro translation system (Brierley et al., 1991) . However, an important difference was noted; when the IBV pseudoknot was replaced by a stable stem \u00b1 loop structure of the same predicted size and nucleotide composition, frameshifting was maintained at a high level in E. coli cells, in con-trast to the situation in RRL, where such a structure promotes only low levels of frameshifting. In naturally occurring frameshift sites in E. coli, the requirements for stimulatory RNA structures appear to be variable. At the G-T ORF overlap of bacteriophage l, no stimulatory secondary structure is apparent (Levin et al., 1993) . In contrast, the dnaX frameshift signal includes both a downstream stem\u00b1loop (Tsuchihashi & Kornberg, 1990) and an upstream stimulatory element formed between a Shine-Delgarno-like sequence (5 H AGGGaG 3 H ) located 10 nt upstream of the slippery sequence and the 3 H -end of 16 S rRNA (3 H UCCUcC 5 H : Larsen et al., 1994) . Variation is also evident at the frameshift sites of bacterial insertion sequences (Chandler & Fayet, 1993) . In IS3, a pseudoknot is required for ef\u00aecient frameshifting (Sekine et al., 1994) and in IS150, stimulation is via a downstream stem\u00b1loop that may form a pseudoknot (Vo \u00c8 gele et al., 1991) . In contrast, although a number of potential RNA structures are predicted to form downstream of the slippery sequence of IS1 (Sekine & Ohtsubo, 1989; Escoubas et al., 1991) , they do not appear to play a role in frameshifting (Sekine & Ohtsubo, 1992) . Whatever the case, a stimulatory structure is absolutely required for IBV frameshifting in E. coli; the UUUAAAG sequence alone was unable to stimulate detectable frameshifting. This is perhaps unsurprising, since in the expression constructs employed, no obvious Shine-Delgarno-like sequences are present upstream of the slippery sequence.",

( , 1992 , who proposed that hypomodi\u00aecation of the anticodons of those tRNAs implicated in decoding frameshift sites may promote ef\u00aecient frameshifting. We began by expressing our frameshift reporter constructs in E. coli tgt mutants unable to biosynthesize Q. In these cells, however, we detected only a modest in\u00afuence of hypomodi\u00aeed tRNA Asn , with frameshifting reduced by about twofold on the slippery sequence UUUAAAC and increased by a similar magnitude at the UUUAAAU site. So for tRNA Asn , at least in E. coli, anticodon hypomo-di\u00aecation per se is insuf\u00aecient to promote highly ef-\u00aecient frameshifting. The modest effects noted, however, are consistent with the view that the strength of the pre-slippage codon-anticodon interaction is important in frameshifting. The hypomo-di\u00aeed variant of tRNA Asn with anticodon 5 H GUU 3 H would be expected to pair more strongly with the AAC codon than with AAU, and hence frameshifting should decrease at the AAC codon and increase at AAU, as was observed. The low levels of frameshifting seen in E. coli at slippery sequences decoded by tRNA Asn , with or without Q, is in contrast to the situation in higher eukaryotic cells, where tRNA Asn is highly slippery (Brierley et al., 1992) , despite possessing an identical anticodon loop (Chen & Roe, 1978) . The altered frameshift capacity may simply be a re\u00afection of the eukaryotic translational environment, but a role for Q in eukaryotic frameshifting cannot be ruled out.",

The increased ef\u00aeciency seen in the trmE strains is consistent with the idea that hypomodi\u00aecation of the anticodon stimulates frameshifting (Hat\u00aeeld et al., 1992) . However, this hypothesis cannot explain the intrinsic slipperiness of the hypermodi-\u00aeed``wild-type'' tRNA Lys . The biological role (or at least one of the roles) of the tRNA Lys modi\u00aecations is thought to be in the regulation of the confor-mational\u00afexibility or rigidity of the base to ensure the correct translation of codons during protein synthesis, particularly to prevent decoding of AAC and AAU. Proton NMR studies of the conformational characteristics of modi\u00aeed uridine bases (Yokoyama et al., 1985) indicate that the mnm 5 s 2 modi\u00aecation introduces conformational rigidity such that the ribose exclusively adopts a C3 H -endo form, which favours recognition of adenosine, allows weak recognition of guanosine and precludes binding to cytosine and uridine. In support of this, tRNA Lys has been shown to decode preferentially the AAA codon and has little af\u00aenity for AAG (Lustig et al., 1981) . Tsuchihashi (1991) has rationalised the high-ef\u00aeciency frameshift signal of the dnaX gene on the basis that the slippery sequence, AAAAAAG, is poorly recognised by tRNA Lys , which slips ef\u00aeciently at the AAG codon due to a weak wobble base-pair. This concept is supported by the experiments reported by Tsuchihashi & Brown (1992) , who were able to inhibit frameshifting at the dnaX site by expressing an additional tRNA Lys with anticodon 5 H CUU 3 H . In these cells, frameshifting at the AAAAAAG slippery sequence is thought to have been prevented by the more stable recognition of the AAG codon by tRNA Lys CUU. We believe that the ef\u00aecient frameshift observed at the IBV signal in E. coli (at UUUAAAG) is also a result of a restricted capacity of tRNA Lys to pair with AAG. The fact that the UUUAAAA slippery sequence is also highly permissive suggests that recognition of AAA by tRNA Lys is also unusual when compared, for example, with the decoding of AAC or AAU by tRNA Asn . Yokoyama et al. (1985) have suggested that both the 2 and 5-substituents contribute to the confor-tRNA Anticodon Modi\u00aecation and Frameshifting mational rigidity of tRNA Lys , with the major input from the 2-thiocarbonyl group. The NMR studies by Agris and colleagues (Sierzputowska-Gracz et al., 1987; Agris et al., 1992) indicate a role for only the 2-position thiolation. A second interaction, a hydrogen bond, has been proposed, which forms between the amino group of 5 H -substitutents containing an aminomethyl moiety (mnm 5 and cmnm 5 ) and the 2 H -OH residue of the adjacent, un-modi\u00aeed U33 base in the U-turn structure of the anticodon loop (Hillen et al., 1978; Yokoyama & Nishimura, 1995 ; and see Figure 4 ). Circular dichroism analysis of the tRNA suggests that the anticodon has an unusual conformation in which the wobble base is buried in the anticodon loop, possibly interacting via its 5 H -substituent with the N 6 threonylcarbamoyl (t 6 ) modi\u00aecation of base A37 across the loop (Watanabe et al., 1993) . Support for this idea comes from studies of a chemically synthesised short oligoribonucleotide comprising U33mnm 5 s 2 U-U-U-t 6 A37 (cited by Agris, 1996) . In this doubly modi\u00aeed pentamer, a unique interaction occurs between the two modi\u00aecations that is thought to be between the amine group of mnm 5 and the amino acid residue of t 6 A, by hydrogen or ionic bonding. Furthermore, model-building studies predict that the anticodon domain U-turn in tRNA Lys is at the mnm 5 s 2 U34 base rather than at the usual invariant residue U33.",

In this light, we expected that gross alterations in the modi\u00aecation status (absence of thiolation in asuE, absence of the 5 H -substituent in trmE) would result in a tRNA that would be less restricted and perhaps pair more readily with lysine codons. Following this logic, frameshifting would be reduced in these mutants, since the codon-anticodon interaction would be more stable. Clearly this was not the case, and at present we are unable to explain these observations satisfactorily. The most likely explanation is that possession of either of the two modi\u00aecations is suf\u00aecient to reduce recognition of lysine codons and allow ef\u00aecient frameshifting. The structural studies imply a role for the amino group of the 5 Hsubstituent of tRNA Lys , most likely in inter-loop contact with t 6 A37. The increase in frameshifting seen with trmE, which does not possess the amino group, may well re\u00afect the loss of such an interaction, resulting in altered recognition of the AAA codon (and to a lesser extent the AAG codon) by the mutant tRNA. It seems unlikely that the effect seen with trmE is related to how well the mutant tRNA is aminoacetylated; ef\u00aecient aminoacetylation appears to be correlated with the presence of the s 2 moiety in tRNAs of this class (Rogers et al., 1995) . The lack of effect of the trmC1 and trmC2 mutations, which retain the amino group, may suggest that the conformation of tRNA Lys in these strains is not suf\u00aeciently different to in\u00afuence codon recognition. In the case of trmC1 (cmnm 5 s 2 U; TH69) and trmC2 (nm 5 s 2 U; TH49), model-building studies (Lim, 1994) support the idea that the modi\u00aeed tRNAs would be expected to have similar decoding properties as the wildtype tRNA. Mutants defective in asuE, trmE and trmC all decrease the ef\u00aeciency of the ochre suppressor tRNA supG, which is a derivative of tRNA Lys with anticodon 5 H mnm 5 s 2 UUA 3 H (reviewed by Bjo \u00c8 rk, 1992) . Whether this re\u00afects a reduced af\u00aenity for the nonsense codon or another step in the suppression pathway is not clear, although the trmC1 mutation is known not to affect the binding properties of tRNA Lys to AAA or AAG programmed ribosomes (Elseviers et al., 1984) .",

The observed effects of hypomodi\u00aeed tRNA Asn on frameshifting at UUUAAAU/C are most consistent with the idea that the strength of the codon-anticodon interaction determines frameshift ef\u00aeciency rather than being mediated primarily by hypomodi\u00aeed tRNAs. However, the data obtained with variantly modi\u00aeed tRNAs Lys are not readily explainable in terms of either model. Although the increased frameshifting seen in trmE strains is consistent with a role for hypomodi\u00aeed tRNAs, the inherent slipperiness of the wild-type hypermodi\u00aeed tRNA Lys argues strongly against this hypothesis. Nevertheless, the data obtained for the other tRNA Lys modi\u00aecation mutants are dif\u00aecult to interpret solely in terms of the predicted strength of codon-anticodon recognition. All ef\u00aecient \u00c01 frameshift sites in E. coli employ tRNA Lys as the A-site decoding tRNA and in all likelihood, this tRNA has a very unusual anticodon structure. In attempting to compare the role of tRNA anticodon modi\u00aecation in frameshifting between prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, we remain mindful that tRNA Lys may be a special case and that the role of modi\u00aeed bases in eukaryotic frameshifting needs to be tested directly.

            "text": "The sequence requirements for IBV frameshifting in E. coli were investigated by expressing the pMM plasmid series in E. coli BL21/DE3/pLysS cells ( Figure 1, Table 1 ), largely as described by Studier et al. (1990) . These cells contain, under the control of the lacUV5 promoter, the gene for T7 RNA polymerase inserted within the int gene of the prophage DE3, a l derivative. Expression of T7 RNA polymerase in BL21 cells can be induced by addition of isopropyl-b,D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Freshly transformed BL21 cells prepared by the method of Hanahan (1983) and containing plasmids of the pMM series were inoculated into 1.5 ml LB cultures containing ampicillin (50 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 mg/ml). After three hours at 37 C, IPTG was added to 0.4 mM and incubation continued for a further three hours. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 150 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris (pH 8), 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM sucrose, 2 mg/ml lysozyme), placed on ice for 30 minutes and treated with DNase I (30 mg/ml) for a further 30 minutes at 37 C in the presence of 8 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM MnCl 2 . Detergent solution (300 ml of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 0.2 M NaCl, 1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) was added and the insoluble material harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for two minutes. The pellet was washed three times with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA and the Triton-in-soluble material, which contained predominantly the pMM expression products, dissolved in 100 ml of sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) . Aliquots were analysed on SDS/ 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to standard procedures (Hames, 1991) . Proteins were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R (0.05%, w/v) in 10% (v/v) acetic acid, 50% (v/v) methanol, and destained in 10% acetic acid, 20% methanol. The relative abundance of non-frameshifted or frameshifted products was estimated (Adobe Photoshop and NIH Image software) by scanning densitometry and adjusted to take into account the differential size of the products. Scans were performed on gels whose proteins were stained to an intensity at the centre of the dynamic range of the scanner (Microtek IIXE Scanmaker). The frameshift ef\u00aeciencies quoted in the text and summarised in Table 2 are the average of three to \u00aeve independent measurements that varied by less than 5%, i.e. a measurement of 40% frameshift ef\u00aeciency was between 38% and 42%.",
