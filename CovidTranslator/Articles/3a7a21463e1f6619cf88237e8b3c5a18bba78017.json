Zeolites containing silver and silver/copper caused significant reductions of coronavirus 229E after 1 h in suspension. The silver/copper combination yielded a [5.13-log 10 reduction within 24 h. It was also the most effective ([3.18-log 10 ) against FIPV after 4 h. Other formulations were ineffective against FIPV. On plastic coupons with incorporated silver/ copper-zeolites, [1.7-log 10 and [3.8-log 10 reductions were achieved for coronavirus 229E and feline calicivirus within 24 h, respectively. Silver/copper zeolite reduced titers of all viruses tested, suggesting that it may be effective against related pathogens of interest [i.e., SARS coronavirus, other coronaviruses, human norovirus (calicivirus)]. Of note, it was effective against both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Metal-zeolites could therefore possibly be used in applications to reduce virus contamination of fomites and thus the spread of viral diseases.",

A novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SCoV) was isolated from patients (Ksiazek et al. 2003; Navas-Mart\u00edn and Weiss 2004) . Before the identification of SCoV, two coronaviruses were known to infect humans, strains 229E and OC43 (Navas-Mart\u00edn and Weiss 2004). These cause mild, self-limiting, upper respiratory tract infections (Myint 1994 ) and belong to the Group I and Group II coronaviruses, respectively. SCoV possesses characteristics specific to all three coronavirus groups (Navas-Mart\u00edn and Weiss 2004), but is not closely related to any (Poutanen et al. 2003) . It is apparently an animal virus that recently adapted to cross the species barrier, allowing for human-to-human transmission (Antia et al. 2003) .",

Feline calicivirus has been found to persist for up to 28 days in a dry environment at room temperature (Doultree et al. 1999) . Also, in a study by Smid et al. (1991) , rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (also a calicivirus) survived for at least 105 days in a dried state at room temperature. Viruses that cause symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea are likely to contaminate the environment. In one study, 607 of 680 (89%) norovirus outbreaks were linked to person-to-person transmission (Evans et al. 1998 ) that included poor hand hygiene as well as surface-tosurface transmission (Barker et al. 2001) . Also, successive outbreaks of norovirus infections in passengers on cruise ships on separate trips have strongly implicated environmental contamination (Barker et al. 2001) . Enveloped viruses are typically less stable in the environment, yet the SCoV is able to survive on fomites for up to 96 h (Duan et al. 2003) . The transmission of SCoV is believed to be multifactorial, with evidence from previous outbreaks suggestive of at least some role for contaminated fomites in the transmission of the virus (Dowell et al. 2004; Chu et al. 2005) .",
