The objective of this prospective study was to assess whether plasmatic DGGR-Lipase activity could detect pancreatic disease secondary to equine endocrine conditions. Fifty four cases presenting or two endocrine diseases (PPID*, n 5 24; EMS**, n 5 9; and/or hypertriglyceridaemia, n 5 23) and 99 healthy control horses were included between 2015 and 2017.

            "text": "Significance: Microbiome could influence the development of AM, but this role deserves further investigation. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a method for the recovery of respiratory secretion from the lower airways and alveoli. It is used primarily for cytological evaluation of non-septic conditions, and is especially helpful when severe equine asthma, mild equine asthma or exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) is suspected. Some clinicians have observed by endoscopy that in some horses the sampled bronchus collapses when vacuum is applied to retrieve the BAL fluid, and thereby reducing the amount of recovered fluid. Poor bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) recovery has been observed in horses with moderate to severe inflammation. The objective of this study was to investigate if the administration of a single dose of a bronchodilator in equine patients with a suspicion of severe equine asthma could help in improving recovery of BALF. A total of 15 horses with severe equine asthma were evaluated: 6 horses were once pretreated 30 minutes before BAL with 0.001 mg/kg of inhaled salbutamol, while 9 horses was not treated. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed with BAL-catheter by instilling 300-350 mL of warm sterile saline, using 60 mL syringes. Amount of recovered fluid was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with a two-tailed Student T-test using Excel. Mean BALF recovery in treated group was 53.9%, while in not-treated group 35.61% (P < 0.05). We can conclude that single pretreatment with salbutamol in horses with severe equine asthma improve the volume of recovered fluid after BAL, therefore clinicians should consider such procedure before performing BAL on horses with suspicion of bronchoconstriction. Strangles is caused by the bacteria Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (S. equi) and is a highly contagious disease with numerous outbreaks every year. Questions remain after an outbreak; what is the optimal duration of quarantine? How and when should stables and materials be cleaned and disinfected in an ideal situation? The purpose of this study was 1) obtain knowledge about how S. equi survives on various materials and 2) identify efficient methods to disinfect contaminated equipment.",

Clinical signs of peritonitis are rare, however a higher complication rates should be anticipated when rolling horses after trocharisation. While Coastal Bermuda hay is strongly associated with ileal impaction in the southeastern United States, stabling on flax bedding has anecdotally been associated with this condition in Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between ileal impactions and the use of flax shives opposed to straw as bedding. Medical records of 2,337 referral cases evaluated for abdominal pain between January 2008 and May 2017 were reviewed. Diagnosis, date of admission, age, breed, gender, weight, stall bedding and outcome were recorded. The association between bedding and ileal impaction was evaluated by a Chi square test; the odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. The proportion of cases stabled on flax bedding was 11.4%. The overall prevalence of ileal impactions was 4.2%. In the flax group, the prevalence of ileal impaction was 9.4% as opposed to 3.6% in the straw group. The OR (2.83; 95% CI, 1.83-4.40; P < 0.001) indicated that horses stabled on flax bedding were approximately 3 times more likely to have ileal impaction compared to horses stabled on straw. No significant association for date of admission, age, breed, gender and weight was found in a multivariate model. Survival to discharge was 72.5% in the medically treated group compared to 76.7% in the surgically treated group. No significant association was found between survival to discharge and type of bedding. These results suggest that horses housed on flax bedding were more likely to develop ileal impaction compared to horses on straw.

The aim of the present study was to determine the best time point for salivary cortisol measurement after stimulation.",

            "text": "In human patients, ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs) originating from different intra-ventricular regions result in distinctive ECG characteristics. The aim of our study is to describe changes in QRS morphology in relation to the site of ventricular ectopy. In 4 horses, under general anesthesia, a mapping catheter (Intellamap Orion, Boston Scientific) was used for ventricular pacing at specific locations in the left and right ventricle. The catheter was guided by 3D electroanatomical mapping (Rhythmia, Boston Scientific) and transthoracic ultrasound. After placement of the catheter in the right and left apical, high septal and high free wall area, supra-threshold ventricular pacing was performed at a pacing cycle length between 800 and 1,000 ms while a modified base-apex ECG (Televet100) was recorded. From this ECG, at sinus rhythm (SR) and at each pacing location, 20 QRS complexes were used for QRS morphology description and measurement of QRS amplitude and duration. Compared to SR, paced QRS complexes had longer duration. A large positive R and small negative s morphology was found at high septal and high right ventricular free wall pacing while apical and high left ventricular free wall pacing resulted in small positive r and large negative S morphology. These preliminary results suggest that typical ECG characteristics from a modified base-apex surface ECG may be helpful to identify the site of ventricular ectopy. These findings might be helpful in future for diagnosis and treatment of complex arrhythmias and development of new treatment strategies.Key words: 3D-electro-anatomical mapping; Echocardiography; Electrocardiogram; QRS characteristics; Ventricular ectopy.",

Aleurone-related research has mainly been performed in vitro or in clinical study models focusing on pathological conditions such as obesity. In this study the effect of oral aleurone supplementation on postprandial glucose-insulin metabolism and fecal microbiome of horses was studied.Methods: An escalating dosing trial (10 weeks) was executed in 8 healthy untrained Standardbred horses in a 4 3 4 cross over model, testing 4 different doses of aleurone (50, 100, 200, 400 g) each supplemented during 7 days, followed by 1 week wash out. Horses were fed concentrate feed twice a day (8 am-aleurone enriched, and 8 pm).Postprandial glycemic (AlphatrakV R ) and insulin (Immulite V R ) levels were monitored on day 7 of each week. Blood was sampled when feeding started (T0) and every 30 minutes (4 hours) and thereafter every 60 minutes (4 hours) for glucose and at T0 and every 10 mins (1 hour), thereafter every 30 minutes (4 hours) for insulin. Fecal samples were collected on day 7 of each week.Fecal cDNA extraction (DNA stool mini kit Qiagen V R ) was followed by high throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq Sequencer). Qiime V R and Emperor V R software were used for microbiome analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed paired T test or, for multiple groups, a two-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni correction.Results: Feeding aleurone delayed time to peak glucose and insulin linearly with increasing aleurone dose (P < 0.05). Peak glucose value and area under the curve (AUC) were not changed, however peak insulin value and AUC reduced linearly with increasing doses of aleurone (P < 0.05).An increased alpha-diversity was seen in the fecal microbiome as of a dose of 200 g aleurone. \u00df-diversity was significantly increased in supplemented versus non-supplemented horses.Aleurone supplementation increased the relative abundance of 9 bacterial genera, of which most significantly Bacteroidetes BF311, of which the species Bacteroidetes acidifaciens showed an 6 11 fold increase.Discussion: Aleurone supplementation seems to have a beneficial effect on glucose-insulin response to concentrate meal uptake in horses. Effects are seen as of a dose of 200 g per day.Interestingly, in mice Bacteroidetes abundance in the fecal microbiome, has been shown to be associated with increased glucagon-like peptide 1 production and improved insulin sensitivity (Yang et al., Mucosal Immunol. 2017; 10 (1): 104-116).Conclusions: Aleurone supplementation seems to have a beneficial effect on glucose-insulin metabolism in response to concentrate meal uptake and to increase microbial richness of the fecal microbiome.Significance: Aleurone could be an interesting avenue to modulate glucose-insulin metabolism and the gut microbiome in horses. The observed effects on postprandial glucose-insulin metabolism could be interesting for supporting exercise performance capacity on one hand and on the other hand for horses suffering from equine metabolic syndrome. Overfeeding, obesity and hyperinsulinemia are associated with cardiovascular changes such as increased blood pressure in ponies; however, it is not yet known when cardiovascular changes occur.By supplying an excessive (200% maintenance) diet rich in carbohydrates and fat, hyperinsulinemia and obesity were further induced in 7 Shetland pony mares (test; BCS 5.5-8/9) during 28 weeks. The control ponies (n 5 6; BCS 4-6/9) received 100% of their daily digestible energy needs. Non-invasive blood pressure measurements (oscillometric device on coccygeal artery; Cardell 9402) were taken weekly during the experimental period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) of both the control group and test group were recorded to examine the effect of an excessive diet. SBP, DBP and HR were significantly higher in the test group compared to the control group, moreover significant changes in HR and DBP occurred directly after starting the diet (wk 1; wk 0, respectively) and SBP changed after about 10 weeks on the diet. The same experiment was repeated one year later after a 16week period of only hay before restarting the excessive diet. Groups slightly differed (test n 5 5, 2 new; control n 5 5, 3 new). Heart rate and blood pressure changes over time showed the same pattern as the year before.Conclusion: Overfeeding increases SBP, DBP and HR of Shetland pony mares. SBP seems to respond differently compared to DBP and HR. Although blood pressures remained within the physiologic range, chronically increased BP can lead to heart diseases. Assessment of insulin dysregulation (ID) is essential to diagnose EMS. However, protocols for implementation of oral diagnostic test vary from glucose administration with the animals' feed to glucose administration via naso-gastric tubing. Manipulation-induced stress response during naso-gastric tubing is a common concern, resulting in missing owner compliance and an uncertainty about impairment of test results. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the impairment of naso-gastric tubing on clinical relevant parameters during oral glucose test (OGT). Eighteen Icelandic horses of varying sex, age, weight and insulin sensitivity were included into the study. OGT was performed with 1 g/kg BW glucose in 2 L water administered via nasogastric tubing, followed by a Sham-OGT (SOGT) with administration of 2 L water without glucose three weeks later. Blood samples were collected for 2 hours and were analyzed for insulin, glucose, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. OGT caused time-dependent increase in glucose concentration (P < 0.0001) and endogenous insulin response (P < 0.0001), whereas glucose and insulin concentrations remained unaffected during SOGT, differing significantly from OGT (P < 0.0001). ACTH and cortisol increased immediately after nasogastric tubing, however both were not significant different from baseline concentrations after 120 minutes. To conclude, clinical relevant insulin and glucose concentrations determined between 60 and 120 minutes showed no variation in SOGT, suggesting most likely no impairment by acute stress response due to naso-gastric tubing. Therefore, glucose application during OGT procedure can be performed via naso-gastric tubing without falsifying the relevant test results in terms of ID although an influence on glucose kinetics related to OGT remains unknown.Key words: ACTH; Cortisol; Horse; Insulin; Naso-gastric tube; Oral glucose test",
