We surveyed 700 households to elicit information on human and animal medicine use and husbandry practices. Households that owned livestock (n=265/459, 57.7%) reported using animal treatments 630 times during the previous 6 months; 57.6% obtained medicines, including antibiotics, from drug-sellers. Government animal health care providers were rarely visited (9.7 %), respondents more often sought animal health care from pharmacies and village doctors (70.6% and 11.9% respectively), citing the latter two as less costly and more successful based on past performance. Animal husbandry practices that could promote the transmission of microbes from animals to humans included: the proximity of chickens to humans (50.1% of households reported that the chickens slept in the bedroom); the shared use of natural bodies of water for human and animal bathing (78.3%); the use of livestock waste as fertilizer (60.9%); and gender roles that dictate that females are the primary care takers of poultry and children (62.8%). In the absence of an effective animal health care system, villagers must depend on local animal health care practitioners for treatment of their animals. Suboptimal use of antimicrobials coupled with unhygienic animal husbandry practices are important risk factors for emerging zoonotic disease and resistant pathogens.",

            "text": "Many factors contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance (See Figure) ; antibiotic usage is considered the most important factor promoting the emergence, selection and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in both veterinary and human medicine (Marshall & Levy, 2011) and exposure to livestock is a risk factor for emerging zoonotic diseases, including antimicrobial resistant pathogens, coronoviruses (SARS, MERS) and filoviruses (Ebola) (Morens et al., 2004) . In the modern poultry industry antimicrobials are used in high quantities -not only for therapy and prevention of bacterial disease but also as antimicrobial growth promoters (AMGPs) in animal feeds -which may constitute the greatest selection pressure for the emergence of resistance (Marshall & Levy, 2011 , Angulo et al., 2009 . The fecal flora of chickens, for example, contains a relatively high proportion of resistant bacteria. Studies from high income countries have reported that poultry are a source of antibiotic resistance for poultry farm workers (Price et al., 2007 , van den Bogaard et al., 2002 . Studies from low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) have shown that poultry farm workers and their family members are at an increased risk for carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria and diarrheal pathogens than the general population (Al-Ghamdi et al., 1999 , Donkor et al., 2012 , Raghunath, 2008 ) (See Figure) . In LMICs people generally live in closer contact with livestock than in high-income countries (HIC) and this is linked to increased risk for diarrheal diseases (Harvey et al., 2003 , Al-Ghamdi et al., 1999 ) (See Figure) . Limited data are available on household level antibiotic use for humans in Bangladesh and no data exists on household level animal antibiotic use there or in other low income countries (Hossain et al., 1982) . One of the few published studies on human antibiotic use in Bangladesh suggested a high rate of medicine use; 189 individuals took 261 drugs, patients rarely obtained a full prescription and about 95% of purchases were from private pharmacies (Hossain et al., 1982) . According to this study there was minimal antibiotic use in animals and none in animal feed in the early 1980s. An extensive literature review did not uncover any additional references on antibiotic use in Bangladesh.",

The qualitative research uncovered important themes related to antibiotic use that this study quantified (Roess 2013) . The qualitative research uncovered local language terminology for animal husbandry practices including types of treatments (antibiotics and feed additives) given to livestock and animal health problems (poor growth, diarrhea). These terms were used in the questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed to elicit information on and quantify: 1) human and animal medicine use at the household level, 2) animal husbandry practices, and 3) human and animal health care provider utilization in rural Bangladesh. The dependent variable of interest was reported recent animal treatment (animal treatment was defined as seeking advice for addressing an animal health concern) within the 6 months prior to the survey. Possible factors associated with recent animal treatment were recorded including: socioeconomic and demographic factors, specifically household structure, drinking water source, and education status; type of animal health care provider (homeopath, drug seller, village doctor, veterinarian); ownership of animals (type of animal, number of animals); type of animal illness; characteristics of the use of medicine for household members (type of medicine, source of medicine, purpose of medicine use); and household member farm worker status (any member working on a farm, any poultry farm workers, any dairy farm workers, any agricultural farm workers). Each of these factors has been shown to have an association with human medicine use variables (Radyowijati & Haak, 2001) . Since limited literature is available on household level animal medicine use and since literature has described animals as an important investment, we hypothesized that some of the same socioeconomic factors influencing household level human antibiotic use would also influence animal antibiotic use.",

Where the medicines were purchased differed significantly according to who recommended the medicines. For instance, village doctors sold what they recommended in more than half of cases (73/135); household members recommended treatments that were most often obtained from pharmacies (331/388); and drug sellers sold what they recommended (30/33). In this context drug sellers were generally in the informal sector and may or may not have formal training as pharmacists. They generally traveled with their products or had small stalls in a market. Pharmacies on the other hand were well-stocked and generally run by pharmacists who had formal training. They were generally larger stalls in market places or small stand along building.",

The prevalence of antibiotic resistant pathogens has increased steadily in LMICs since the introduction of antibiotics (Radyowijati & Haak, 2003) . Despite the recognized importance of examining both animal and human antibiotic use at the household level in a LMIC setting no other studies have been published that report this information. We report frequent animal medicine use at the household level in rural Bangladesh (Sylhet district) and frequent treatment purchase from pharmacies which are indicative of non-human antibiotic use. Respondents reported using medicines in almost a quarter of animal treatment events specifically for diarrhea and fever more than other treatments, and medicines were recommended and obtained from trained health care-providers and drug sellers. We conducted qualitative interviews with drug-sellers and village doctors to triangulate the findings of this study and we found that the terms that respondents used for medicines were used by drug-sellers and village doctors for antimicrobials (most commonly referring to oxytetracycline and metronidazole). The reported use of medicines may be a proxy for antibiotic use; yet information on the extent of non-human antibiotic use is lacking (Roess, 2006 , Roess et al., 2013 . Additives were most often recommended by household members and were a common treatment. As described, additives referred to grain and commercial animal feed that included antimicrobials and were used primarily to treat animals that were in general poor health or were not growing (Roess, 2006) . Living with a household member who was working on a poultry farm or another type of farm was associated with using animal medicines and additives. We previously reported that commercial poultry farms in Bangladesh use prepared animal feed and antibiotics and that poultry farm workers reported applying these techniques for their personal livestock holdings (Roess, 2006 , Roess et al., 2013 .",

Other important animal health care providers that emerged in our studies included: government veterinarians, livestock office doctors (poshudaktar), and \"locals who know about animals\" (Roess, 2006) . The lack of infrastructure was perceived by the household respondents and by the veterinarians interviews as an obstacle to seeking adequate health care for themselves and their livestock when it is needed (Roess, 2006) . Livestock are important culturally: in establishing the status of the farmer as providers of employment to the farmer and family members; as a store of wealth; and as a form of insurance (Riethmuller, Chai et al. 1999) . Livestock provide an opportunity for low-income farmers to accumulate capital, which in turn helps reduce hunger (Riethmuller, Chai et al. 1999; Singh 2001; Peeling and Holden 2004) . The loss of an animal for a small farmer can have severe consequences, such as the loss of a source of income or social standing in the community. These are important justifications for spending a significant portion of household income on animal medicines, health care and other means of protecting livestock.",

Rationale for animal antibiotic use in rural Bangladesh is similar to that of American farmers in the 1950\u2032s and 60\u2032s when agricultural antibiotic use was beginning (McEwen & Fedorka-Cray, 2002 )-specifically respondents report that it is an effective way to protect herds of animals who lived in closed quarters from diseases and thus appears to be economically sound. Future studies should examine the prevalence and emergence of antibiotic resistant microbes in similar settings in the context of household level antibiotic use for humans and animals. Due to logistic constraints and the lack of financial resources we were unable to do so. Nevertheless, the emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens is quickly outweighing the perceived benefits of animal agricultural antimicrobial use. Several European countries and the European Commission banned avoparcin in animal feed and this led to a decrease in human cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (Angulo et al., 2009) ; similar interventions may be useful in Bangladesh. Another limitation in our study is that it was nested in the comparison arm of an impact evaluation and participants had to meet the inclusion criteria which included be married or divorced or widowed and have a baby less than 18 months old. It can be argued that families that do not have infants may behave differently with regard to use of animal household products.",

Environmental health impacts of agricultural antibiotic use, including the observation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria of animal origin in areas surrounding livestock operations, could also be mitigated by such measures (Landers 2012) . Globalization and the documented epidemics during the study period, most notably severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah-like virus, and H5N1, are evidence for the need to strengthen surveillance of emerging diseases, including resistant strains in even remote areas of the world (Xing et al., 2010 , Kerkhove, 2013 . In May 2005, the World Health Organization passed an amendment mandating the reporting of 7 diseases in member countries (Steiger, 2005) . Although none of these reportable diseases include antibiotic resistance, this important step can be a platform on which surveillance programs can be built to monitor the emergence of resistance in the environment in remote areas. Information gathering of agricultural antibiotic use is necessary to inform treatment recommendations for people in affected areas. Improvement of government animal health services to strengthen outreach to the remote populations is needed to assist them to protect their livelihood, monitor animal health, and prevent emergence of resistant bacteria in such populations.",
