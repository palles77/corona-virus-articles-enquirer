The idea of structural modifications of nucleosides and nucleotides gained interest fairly early and appeared fruitful supplying a wide variety of marketed compounds such as ribavirin, zidovudine, adefovir and many others (Fig. 1 ). In general, the modifications included replacements of the phosphate P(O)eOeC bond for the non-hydrolysable phosphonate P(O)eC linkage, a furanose ring for other heterocyclic or even acyclic fragments or natural nucleobases for unnatural, substituted heteroaromatic or even homoaromatic systems. Several functionalities have been tried as linkers and aliphatic chains as well as 3-to 6-membered aliphatic and aromatic homo-and heterocyclic systems exemplify a long list of examples [1e4] .",

The idea of retaining the natural nucleobases with simultaneous introduction of the functionalised 1,2,3-triazole unit into a furanose ring led to compounds 1 and 2 which showed an antiviral activity [5, 6] . On the other hand 2 0 ,3 0 -diethanethio-2 0 ,3 0 ,5 0 -trideoxy-5 0 -triazolonucleosides 3 displayed antitumour activity [7] . Recently, Kim et al. designed novel 1,2,3-triazole-appended C5-modified nucleosides 4 and their anticancer activity was demonstrated [8, 9] . Various acyclonucleosides [10, 11] and acyclonucleoside phosphonates [12] containing a 1,2,3-triazole unit were obtained from N-propargyl nucleobases and their antiviral activity was evaluated. Among them, pyrimidine-and purine-containing derivatives 5 and 6 appeared to be the most potent so far and exhibited anti-HCV activity (IC 50 values of 16 mM) without any cytotoxicity at a concentration up to 100 mM. On the basis of a similar idea, novel 1,2,3-triazole nucleosides 7 linked to DNA nucleobases as a recognition element have been synthesised and their antiviral activity was evaluated [13] .",
