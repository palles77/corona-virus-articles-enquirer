Hands may act as vectors transferring the organism to food where enterotoxins may be formed and result in acute gastroenteritis on ingestion. Nasal carriers and contaminated foods are possible sources of S aureus contamination. 1 However, studies of S aureus carriage in food handlers have mainly focused on nasal colonization, 2 with limited investigation of the origins of hand contamination. Although hand and environmental contamination in Spanish food handlers was recently investigated, there was no attempt to match sources of contaminating organisms and nasal carriage. 3 A Japanese study that investigated transmission using ribotyping demonstrated spread from contamination of cooking equipment and another worker by a colonized food handler. 4 Because SFP is an important cause of foodborne illness, identification of sources of contamination is essential to determine appropriate hygiene interventions. This study aimed to investigate the sources of S aureus contaminating hands of food handlers.",

Such transmission would most likely occur indirectly, as a result of nasally contaminated hands of colonized workers contaminating the environment, utensils, or food, which are then in contact with other food handlers. The lower diversity of spa types from hand isolates matching nasal isolates from persistent carriers rather than those of transient carriers indicated that the majority of contamination may be originating from a few persistent carriers. The most frequently isolated straindt189dis commonly isolated from human infections in Southeast Asia 6 and has been isolated from pork products, including local roasted pork. 7 Types t091, t127, and t701 have been implicated in food poisoning outbreaks in China, 8 and types t127 and t084 have been implicated from SFP isolates from Germany. 9 Persistent carriers harbor higher loads of the organism and may contaminate their hands and surrounding environments. 10 Environmental contamination can lead to transmission to hands of noncolonized workers who may become transient carriers and/ or transfer the organisms via their hands to food. 4 Up to 90% of nasal carriers have been shown to simultaneously harbor the bacteria in their noses and on their hands. 10 However, in our study, endogenous hand contamination was surprisingly rare, which might be attributable to regular handwashing, because reinforcement reduced isolation of these strains at site C. Environmental contamination from persistent carriers may also involve aerosols from these workers in addition to the usually considered nose-to-hand-to-environment transmission route. Reinforcement of handwashing also led to elimination of spa types from sources other than colonized coworkers. This indicates handwashing before commencement of work removes contamination from outside the workplace. Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, hand hygiene has improved as a result of government initiatives, including appointment of hygiene supervisors to monitor handwashing. The overall low level of hand contamination we found was similar to the 9% reported for Finnish airline-catering workers 11 ",
