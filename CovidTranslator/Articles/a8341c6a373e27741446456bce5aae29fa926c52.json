            "text": "these peaks were identified by determining the most frequently covered topics, specifically: the death of Carlo Urbani, the Italian WHO officer who identified the disease in Hanoi; the first two probable cases in Italy; the death of a suspected case in Naples; and the press conference announcing the first meeting of the Italian National Task Force. The highest peak occurred on April 23, after the announcement that the number of cases had reached 4,000 and that a vaccine would not be available anytime soon. In the days after the peak, coverage remained quite high, in association with the definition of SARS as a \"global threat\" by WHO and the twofold increase in the number of probable cases in Italy. The high press coverage was followed by an overall decrease, although small peaks occurred in association with the conflicts among European Ministries on airport measures, increased quarantine measures in China, and the identification of the civet cat as a probable source of SARS-CoV. Coverage tended to be greater on weekends, probably because political stories constitute less competition for space on these days.",

During outbreaks of infections, both the media and the public are often criticized for overreacting, yet public concern over serious health hazards is essential in guiding prevention activities (3-5) and in deciding whether to adopt measures that could place restrictions on civil rights, such as quarantine (6) quality of risk-communication of the journalists or of the experts quoted in the articles, wide press coverage of the WHO global alert may have contributed to public-health bodies' taking action towards containing the epidemic.",

The cases occurred in Tzu-Chi High School, a private boarding school for 830 students 12 to 18 years of age, all of whom live in the same building and eat daily meals together in the school cafeteria. On April 28, when a student (case-patient 1) visited the school nurse on the first day that he had a fever, an infection specialist from affiliated Tzu-Chi Medical Center immediately responded. The specialist discovered that this student's close friend in the same class (case-patient 2) was already febrile. Case-patient 2, a Hong Kong resident who leaves Taiwan for Hong Kong every 3 months, had visited Hong Kong twice in March and April 2003. Both students were isolated in the hospital on April 28.",

All nine schoolmates underwent chest x-ray examinations and were tested for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS -CoV) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (4) and DNA sequencing. The tested length for SARS-CoV was 340 bp in the RNA-dependent polymerase region. Those teenagers with diarrhea were tested for Norovirus in their stool by RT-PCR. For those teenagers with cough, throat swabs were cultured for influenza and parainfluenza virus.",
