A double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) based on the use of monoclonal antibodies was developed for the detection of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV). The DAS-ELISA was compared with RT-PCR in the examination of 506 specimens collected during 2006-2007 from pigs originating from different farms located in the Po valley. Both faecal samples obtained directly from the rectum of live animals showing clinical signs and intestinal samples collected from the caecum of deceased pigs were included in the study. The correlation between the two methods was higher when testing faecal samples (K = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-1.00) than testing intestinal samples (K = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.35-0.89). The use of ELISA technology provided an efficient and effective mean of evaluating the presence of coronavirus PED antigen in field samples and indicates that this procedure is a very useful tool in epidemiological studies.",

Since then, several outbreaks of the disease have been reported in many swineraising countries, most notably in Europe and East Asia (Pensaert and Sang-Geon, 2006) . PEDV induces an enteric disease similar to that caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in pigs of all ages with high morbidity and mortality related to the age. Mortality rate averages 50% but may be as high as 90% in pigs less than 7 days of age and very low or nil in pigs older than 2 weeks (Pensaert and DeBouck, 1978; Pensaert and Sang-Geon, 2006; Pritchard et al., 1999) .",

Samples were dispensed to duplicate wells and, after incubation a 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the HRPO-conjugated MAb 1F12 was added at a pre-determined optimal dilution. Positive and negative controls for PEDV were included in each plate. The diluting buffer consisted of PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% yeast extract. Following incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the substrate solution (orthophenylenediamine dihydrochloride 0.5 mg/ml and 0.02% H 2 O 2 in 50 mM phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5.0) was then added. The colorimetric reaction was stopped after 10 min by addition of 2 N sulphuric acid and the absorbance values were read at 492 nm using a spectrophotometer. Results were expressed as an optical density (OD). Fifty microliters per well of reagent were dispensed; three washings with PBS-Tween 20 were performed after each incubation.",

When examining faeces, only two samples gave discordant results, i.e. they were negative by ELISA, but were identified as PEDV-positive by RT-PCR. The kappa value was high (0.97), suggesting an almost perfect agreement between the two methods. The ELISA test may fail to detect antigens in faecal samples with very low viral titres specially when clinical specimens are collected in the recovery phase of the disease. Other reasons could be the presence in faeces of specific antibodies that form immunocomplexes, or an excessive delay between collection and examination resulting in sample degradation and loss of antigenic sites.",

In particular, 6 of the 291 intestinal samples were positive by both methods, whereas 7 samples resulted ELISA positive, but RT-PCR negative. Such disagreement could be due to the presence of PCR inhibitors and DNA damaging substances in stool samples, but can also result from poor-quality specimens, e.g. extremely autolysed tissues or those stored at room temperature for prolonged periods. In addition, false-positive reactions in the ELISA assay may be due to the non-specific binding of antibodies used as reagents to intestinal bacteria or their products (Brandt et al., 1981) . However, this was probably not the case since the results did not change, even after incubation of ELISA pos/RT-PCR neg samples with a negative mouse serum in order to block a potential binding between murine antibody (MAbs) and pig specimens. It is already known that ELISA results depend on the clinical and pathological data: in intestinal contents and faecal specimens obtained from experimentally infected PEDV piglets, the virus shedding is detected with high consistency during the acute phase of disease, but much less frequently during the incubation period and the recovery phase (Callebaut et al., 1982) . Our data confirm that for a successful and correct diagnosis of PEDV it is advisable to collect faecal materials at the onset of illness rather than taking intestinal contents from dead or suppressed animals with prolonged clinical signs.",
