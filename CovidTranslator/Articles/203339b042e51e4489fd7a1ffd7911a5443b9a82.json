She had no history of rash, head trauma, drug ingestion, travel abroad, or contact with animals. Her vaccination record was up to date. Her 3 older siblings were healthy. On examination, she was irritable and febrile (temperature 39\u00b0C), with tachypnea, tachycardia, and photophobia. On lung auscultation, a few crackles were heard on the right side. The rest of her physical examination, including a bedside undilated fundoscopic examination, was unremarkable. Blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid examination, and neuroimaging studies were conducted (Table) . Results of renal and liver function and metabolic screening tests and serum calcium, troponin T, immunoglobulins, and total complement levels were within reference limits. Diagnostic test results were negative for respiratory viruses including influenza A(H1N1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. A chest radiograph showed right middle lobe haziness suggestive of pneumonitis.",

Hia meningitis is strikingly reminiscent of Hib meningitis, manifesting as a serious illness mostly in otherwise healthy children 6-24 months of age (1, 4, 5) . Hia has been reported to be the most virulent among encapsulated H. influenzae after Hib; the genetic structure of virulent Hia strains closely resembles that of virulent Hib strains with respect to the duplicated arrangement of the capsule locus and, in some cases, partial deletion of the IS1016-bexA gene locus (5-7; online Technical Appendix Table) . An active hospital-based surveillance study for meningitis during 1996-2007 in Salvador, Brazil, reported that Hia and Hib meningitis occurred mainly among children <5 years of age; case-fatality rates were higher than those for meningitis caused by types e and f and NTHi strains, which occurred in older age groups and tended to have a better prognosis (6) . The study observed an association between IS1016-bexA deletion and poor clinical outcome of Hia meningitis.",

With documentation of 3 cases (including the case reported here) of Hia meningitis in the Eastern Mediterranean Region within <2 years (8), more than a decade after Hib vaccine implementation, it is crucial to monitor meningitis in children within the region, complemented by laboratory characterization of incoming specimens by molecular methods for rapid, accurate information on all (7) and recurrent invasive diseases (9,10) and outbreaks caused by Hia (9; online Technical Appendix Table) emphasize the necessity for continued surveillance, strong laboratory support, and local epidemiologic studies on non-b H. influenzae disease. Hia meningitis has been reported mainly in the indigenous peoples of Canada, Alaska (USA), and Australia; in the Navajo and White Mountain Apache tribes in the southwestern United States; and in Utah (USA), Brazil, the Gambia, East Africa, and Papua New Guinea. Sporadic cases have been reported in the rest of the world (1,10; online Technical Appendix Table) . The reasons behind the high rates of invasive Hia disease among indigenous children remain unclear (1) . In Canada, where invasive non-b H. influenzae disease has been included in the list of nationally reportable diseases (http://diseases.canada.ca/notifiable/diseases-list) since 2007, a public health-driven initiative has been established to provide a better characterization of the epidemiology of invasive Hia disease and develop a candidate vaccine against Hia (online Technical Appendix Table) .",
