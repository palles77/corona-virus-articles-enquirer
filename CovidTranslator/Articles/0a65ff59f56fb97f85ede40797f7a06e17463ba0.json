We constructed a series of recombinant DIs (rDIs), a highly attenuated vaccinia strain, expressing a gene encoding four structural proteins (E, M, N and S) of SARS-CoV individually or simultaneously. These rDIs elicited SARS-CoV-specific serum IgG antibody and T-cell responses in vaccinated mice following intranasal or subcutaneous administration. Mice that were subcutaneously vaccinated with rDIs expressing S protein with or without other structural proteins induced a high level of serum neutralizing IgG antibodies and demonstrated marked protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge in the absence of a mucosal IgA response. These results indicate that the potent immune response elicited by subcutaneous injection of rDIs containing S is able to control mucosal infection by SARS-CoV. Thus, replication-deficient DIs constructs hold promise for the development of a safe and potent SARS vaccine.",

As of 31 July 2003, 8,098 SARS cases had been identified worldwide, resulting in 774 deaths and a mortality rate of about 9.6% (World Health Organization statistics). SARS is now known to result from infection with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . Evidence that SARS-CoV is the etiologic agent of SARS follows an experimental infection of macaques (Macaca fascicularis), fulfilling Koch's postulates . The clinical manifestations of SARS are hardly distinct from other common respiratory viral infections, including influenza. Because influenza epidemics might occur simultaneously with the eventual re-emergence of SARS, an effective SARS vaccine is urgently required, as well as more sensitive diagnostic tests specific for SARS.",

Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is a plus-stranded RNA virus with a 30-kb genome encoding replicase gene products and the 4 structural proteins; i.e., spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The S protein is thought to be involved in receptor binding, while the E protein has a role in viral assembly, the M protein is important for virus budding, and the N protein has a role in viral RNA packaging (for review, see reference (Holmes, 2003) ). Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV . Thus, the first step of infection likely involves binding of S protein to the ACE2 receptor. In a model of MHV infection, S protein is known to contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibody responses in mice (Collins et al., 1982) . Therefore, the S protein of coronavirus might be manipulated to induce immunity. However, S, M, and N proteins are also known to contribute to the host immune response (Anton et al., 1996; Jackwood and Hilt, 1995) . A DNA vaccine encoding the S glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induces T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model . Vaccination with a plasmid expressing N protein is capable of generating strong N-specific humoral and T-cell-mediated immune responses in vaccinated C57BL/6 mice (Kim et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2004) . In addition, N-specific CD8 + T cells provide protective immunity against some coronaviruses (Collisson et al., 2000; Seo et al., 1997) .",

A robust signal was detected at 50 kDa, corresponding to the N protein of SARS-CoV, as predicted by its genomic size (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . A band approaching 200 kDa likely corresponds to the S protein, which is known to be heavily glycosylated ( Fig. 2A) . Our results are consistent with data reported by Xiao et al. (2003) who expressed the full-length S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV Tor2 strain in 293 cells and demonstrated a protein approaching 180-200 kDa by SDS gel electrophoresis. Concerning the M protein, only a smear band in the stacking gel was detected using a polyclonal antibody against synthetic peptide of the M protein (Mizutani et al., 2004) , presumably because it formed large oligomers with SDS-resistance in cells ( Fig. 2A) .

Thus, our results, consistent with others (Bisht et al., 2004; Buchholz et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004) , indicate that the S protein is a prerequisite for eliciting a sufficient IgG antibody response for neutralization. Similar neutralizing activity was obtained in mice receiving S alone or in combination with other components. Therefore, we expected that the rDIsSARS expressing E/M/N/S proteins in combination could be the best vaccine candidate among others. (M, N and S, respectively) . Purified SARS-CoV virion (0.5 \u03bcg) was used as a positive control. SARS-CoV proteins were detected using monoclonal antibodies (N and S) or polyclonal antibodies (M).

To analyze subcellular localization of these proteins, monoclonal antibody against GM-130 (Golgi marker) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were used.

We, next, examined mucosal immunity in the respiratory tracts of mice inoculated with rDIsSARS either subcutaneously or intranasally. The level of anti-SARS-CoV IgA within nasal wash fluid of vaccinated mice was determined by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As shown in Fig. 4A , substantial levels of anti-SARS-CoV IgA were detected only in mice received intranasal inoculation of rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S, compared to those inoculated with parental DIs (P = 0.0010). The level of IgA detected in intranasally rDIsSARS-E/M/N/Sinoculated mice was similar to that observed following intranasal immunization with UV-inactivated, purified SARS-CoV virion (positive control). On the other hand, subcutaneous injection of all forms of rDIsSARS produced only slightly higher levels of IgA than those observed in DIs -injected control mice.

We inoculated three times with 10 pfu of rDIsSARS-N, rDIsSARS-E/M/S or rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S into four mice in each group either subcutaneously or intranasally. One week after final inoculation, the mice were challenged intranasally with 10 4 tissue culture 50% infectious dose (TCID 50 ) of SARS-CoV. The results were shown in Fig. 4D . In mice inoculated with saline, 10 3 TCID 50 /ml of SARS-CoV were recovered from lung wash fluid on day 3. In contrast, titers of SARS-CoV from the lungs of mice subcutaneously immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/S or rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S were below the limits of detection. The same was true for mice intranasally immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S, whereas the virus was recovered in mice similarly immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/S. Taken into consideration of a relatively low or marginal level of mucosal IgA antibody in mice intranasally immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S or rDIsSARS-E/M/S, or even no IgA response by subcutaneous route as described above, it was suggested that mucosal IgG antibody, but not IgA antibody, likely contributed to the protective immunity, especially in mice simultaneously immunized with recombinant rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S.",

In a previous study of coronaviruses, S protein was shown to play an important role in viral pathogenesis, as well as induction of protective immunity (Holmes, 2003) . In order to assess the ability of rDIsSARS to induce SARS-CoV S-specific T cells, T cells from axillary lymph nodes (ALN), superficial cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and spleens of mice subcutaneously immunized with rDIs-SARS-S or DIs were isolated and stimulated in vitro with UVinactivated, purified SARS-CoV virion. Culture supernatant was collected 4 days later, and the levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were measured. T cells in ALN produced the greatest cytokine levels (Fig. 5 , and data not shown). This is not surprising in light of the subcutaneous route of immunization. Notably, mice immunized with rDIsSARS-S produced a high level of IFN-\u03b3 upon in vitro stimulation with UV-inactivated, purified SARS-CoV virion. The production of TNF-\u03b1, an inflammatory cytokine, was significantly elevated in T cells in ALN of rDIsSARS-S immunized mice after in vitro stimulation with virion antigens. However, TNF-\u03b1 production was observed also in mice immunized with parental DIs without in vitro stimulation with virion antigens. Since T cells from the lymph nodes of na\u00efve mice did not produce cytokines even after in vitro stimulation with virion antigens (data not shown), it is possible that injection of DIs induces mild local inflammation, even when viral proliferation does not occur at the injection site. The pattern of IL-2, IL-5 and IL-4 production were similar to that of IFN-\u03b3, and the maximum level of these cytokines in ALN T cells from rDIsSARS-S-immunized mice were 254, 227 and 88 ng/ml, respectively.",

We carried out IFN-\u03b3 enzymelinked immunospot (ELISPOT) analysis using four 20-mer peptides corresponding to the ACE2 binding region of the S protein selected using the SYFPEITHI score (S44-47), as well as overlapping 20-mer peptides pool covering a whole N protein. When the splenic T cells of mice were analyzed following intranasal or subcutaneous immunization with the most potent vaccine, rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S, a high level of reactivity against S46 was observed especially in the T cells of subcutaneously immunized mice (Fig. 6A ). Zhi et al. recently identified a CD4 + T cell epitope, known as NYNYKYRYL, in BALB/c mice (Zhi et al., 2005) . S46 contains this sequence, thus, these IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells are likely CD4 + T cells. To detect N-specific T cells, mice subcutaneously or intranasally immunized with rDIsSARS-N were analyzed by ELISPOT. In this case, ten peptides were pooled from amino-terminus of N protein, resulting in 5 pools of peptides. We thus detected Nreactive T cells capable of recognizing the first 10 peptides pool (Fig. 6B) , and observed a greater proportion of N-specific T cells following nasal immunization than subcutaneous immunization. These results indicate that S-and N-specific T cells are generated systemically by rDIs.",

SARS-CoV antigens were diffusely observed within the bronchial and alveolar epithelium.

DNA vaccines (Kim et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2005) and viral vectors such as vaccinia virus (Bisht et al., 2004; Weingartl et al., 2004) , parainfluenza virus , adenovirus (Zakhartchouk et al., 2005) and rhabdoviruses (Faber et al., 2005; Kapadia et al., 2005) are used as recombinant vaccines. Yang et al. (2004) showed that viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors, and protection was mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism. Bisht et al. (2004) showed that inoculation of BALB/c mice with a recombinant MVA expressing SARS-CoV S protein elicited serum antibodies to SARS-CoV S protein and protective immunity against SARS-CoV infection. Previous studies demonstrated passive transfer of serum from immunized mice conferred protection against SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract following inoculation with either SARS CoV or recombinant MVA expressing S protein (Bisht et al., 2004; Subbarao et al., 2004) . These results suggest that S protein is a crucial antigen in generating protective immunity. We observed that intranasal or subcutaneous inoculation of BALB/c mice with rDIs expressing S protein (rDIsSARS-S, rDIsSARS-E/M/S or rDIsSARS-E/M/ N/S) produced serum antibodies capable of recognizing the SARS-CoV virion by ELISA, also capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV in vitro. The subcutaneous route appears to elicit stronger immunity than intranasal immunization with respect to the level of anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody produced. Important finding here is that although the mucosal IgA antibody response was induced only in mice intranasally immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S, the mice administered with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S by either route elicited strong protective immunity. Therefore, the protection was achieved in the absence of a mucosal IgA response in mice subcutaneously immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S. Thus, our results clearly show that mucosal infection might be prevented in the presence of a high level of neutralizing serum IgG antibody. Control mice vaccinated with DIs not expressing envelope proteins were not protected, indicating that the effect was specific for the expressed envelope proteins of SARS-CoV and was not due to enhanced nonspecific immunity.",

In another study, the importance of SARS-CoV structural proteins in generating protective immunity was investigated by expressing them individually and in combination using a recombinant parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 vector. The expression of S with the two other putative virion envelope proteins, M and E protein, did not augment the neutralizing antibody response. In the absence of S, expression of M and E, or the nucleocapsid protein N, did not induce a detectable serum SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody response . Our results were consistent with this in that expression of M or N proteins by administration of DIs harboring SARS-CoV M or N gene singly did not induce a neutralizing antibody response, although anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were detected by ELISA.",

Although we here showed that N protein expression by rDIs was capable of eliciting N-specific humoral and cellular immunity, vaccination with rDIsSARS-N failed to elicit a neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV infection in vitro, and failed to confer full protection in vaccinated mice against SARS-CoV challenge, suggesting that SARS-CoV N protein-specific antibodies and CTLs were not sufficient to provide full protection against SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Histopathological analysis of lung tissues in the present study revealed a marked lymphocytic infiltration in peribronchial sites in mice immunized intranasally or subcutaneously with recombinant vaccinia virus DIs expressing E/M/S or E/ M/N/S. Almost no SARS-CoV antigens were detected in these areas upon immunohistochemical analysis. The infiltrating lymphocytes were shown to be CD3 positive T-cells. This is the first evidence of induction of protective immunity against SARS-CoV associated with marked infiltration of T cells at a SARS-CoV infection site. We were able to detect SARS-CoV S-specific CD8 + T cells in the spleen of these immunized mice by INF-\u03b3 ELISPOT. Thus, these results suggest that T cell induction in mice immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/S and rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S might provide additional help to completely eliminate SARS-CoV in the lung. Of note, Weingartl et al. (2004) reported a low level of neutralizing antibody response in ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) immunized with a recombinant MVA expressing SARS-CoV S protein. They also showed that there are more rapid and vigorous neutralizing antibody responses in immunized ferrets, compared to control animals after challenge with SARS-CoV. However, SARS-CoV infection and spreading in the immunized ferrets is not prevented. Moreover, upon infection with SARS-CoV, strong inflammatory responses were noted in ferrets immunized with either recombinant MVA expressing SARS-CoV S or N protein, suggesting that vaccination with the recombinant MVA expressing SARS-CoV S or N protein may, in some case, lead to enhanced pathology during SARS-CoV infection (Czub et al., 2005; Weingartl et al., 2004) . It was also reported that antibodies that neutralized most human SARS-CoV S enhanced entry mediated by the civet virus S, suggesting the possibility that such kind of vaccines might enhance viral infection (Yang et al., 2005) . Although we observed no such pathology in rDIs-immunized mice after virus challenge, the potential for widespread tissue damage following administration of SARS-CoV proteins should be carefully investigated. In addition, further studies are required to clarify whether the recruited T-cells indeed play an important role in clearance of SARS-CoV from sites of infection.",

The plates were then incubated with either peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Zymed, South San Francisco, CA) or IgA (1:2000, Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) antibody. The plates were washed three times with PBS-Tween at each step. The substrate mixture (o-phenylenediamine (Zymed) and hydrogen peroxide) was added to each well, and the absorbance of each well was read at 490 nm using a model 680 microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). To provide a standard for IgG detection, serum was obtained from a hyperimmunized mouse and the OD490nm value of 100 ELISA units/ml of standard serum was around three in every assay.",
