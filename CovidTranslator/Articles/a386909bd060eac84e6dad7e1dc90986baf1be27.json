A chest radiograph showed bilateral micronodular infiltrates (Fig. 1) . The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis showed severe hypoxemia with PaO 2 of 70 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 60%, respiratory acidosis with PaCO 2 of 52. Fourteen days after admission to ICU, and despite treatment with oseltamivir and aggressive supportive care with mechanical ventilation, fluid resuscitation, and high dose norepinephrine infusion, refractory hypoxia rapidly led to a fatal multiorgan failure. No autopsy was performed. Cultures of BAL fluid, blood and urine specimens remained negative for mycobacteria, and fungi. Only Escherichia coli from urine and Proteus mirabilis from BAL (both were susceptible to meropenem) were detected.",
