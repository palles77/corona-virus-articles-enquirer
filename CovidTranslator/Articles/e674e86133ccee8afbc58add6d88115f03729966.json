The first is the water stretching and bending modes at ca. 3200-3700 cm \u00c01 and 1600-1630 cm \u00c01 , respectively, 1 which dominate the IR spectra of any dilute biological sample. When studying water-soluble proteins, it is possible to overcome this problem partially through the use of highly concentrated specimens, short sample path lengths, and/or use of D 2 O. In contrast, membrane proteins are particularly suited for examination by FTIR spectroscopy. Here, water opacity is much less of a problem because the lipid bilayer is the dominant solvent of the protein. Hence, after the removal of bulk water, membrane proteins can readily be studied by FTIR in their native environment -the lipid membrane.",

In other words, the width of a single vibrational mode is often significantly larger than the differences between individual vibrations. Therefore, traditional IR spectroscopy yields information that pertains to the average properties of a protein or that which is obtained because of coupling between numerous modes. The advent of isotope editing in IR spectroscopy of proteins has alleviated this problem to an extent, because of the ability of isotopomers to shift the vibrational frequency to a 'transparent' region of the spectrum. If we assume that the vibrational mode between atoms a and b behaves as a harmonic oscillator, its frequency, w a;b will change upon isotope editing of atom a to c and b to d as follows:",

For example, the amide A vibrational mode (mostly the N-H stretch) at ca. 3300 cm \u00c01 will shift \u00c0890 cm \u00c01 upon deuteration ( 14 N-1 H ! 14 N-2 H) but only \u00c07 cm \u00c01 upon isotope labeling of the nitrogen ( 14 N-1 H ! 15 N-1 H). This is due to a relative change of 100% with regard to the hydrogen atom mass in the first case, versus a relative change of 7% with regard to the nitrogen atom mass, in the second case. Thus, because of its ability to isolate an individual vibration, isotope-edited FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool that can yield precise information regarding the labeled site. Moreover, it does so with minimal interference, because isotopomeric species are normally completely silent with respect to the chemical nature (e.g., structural perturbation) of the examined protein.",

The \u00c040 cm \u00c01 shift that results from 13 C 16 O incorporation yields an isotope-edited mode present as a shoulder on the natural (unlabeled) 12 C 16 O peak (see Figure 1 ). Furthermore, the natural abundance of 13 C (1.1%) maintains that in any protein with 90 amino acids or more, the contribution of non-labled 13 C is as much, or more than that of the label. To overcome the above shortcomings, we often utilize the 13 C 18 O label [7, 8] . The frequency shift of \u00c065 cm \u00c01 places the isotope-edited absorption band so that it is nearly base-line resolved from the much larger 12 C 16 O mode, and the natural abundance of the 13 ",

In large proteins, it is useful to compare the results with spectra of an unlabeled protein to verify that the suspected peak originates from the isotopically labeled amino acid.

The authors performed a 'reaction-induced difference FTIR', in which a reaction is initiated by changing the sample conditions and the resulting difference in the FTIR spectra is recorded. By using LacY uniformly labeled with 13 C and 15 N the authors were able to assign peaks in the difference spectra at 1765-1730 cm \u00c01 to carboxylic groups as well as to assign additional spectral features to contributions of other side chain moieties such as lysine, arginine, histidine and the amidic residues.

Thus, polarized spectroscopy of a macroscopically aligned sample can determine the orientation of a particular chromophore if the geometry of the transition dipole moment in relation to the chromophore's principal axis is known. Because it is very easy to macroscopically align membrane proteins by depositing them in membrane stacks, this methodology has been used extensively in infrared spectroscopy to determine the average tilt angle of helices based on a simple linear dichroism experiment (see Figure 2 for a schematic representation). Specifically, the measurement of the absorption ratio between parallel and perpendicular polarized light (relative to the membrane plane) can yield the orientation of the molecule in question (for review see [14] [15] [16] ).",

These restraints were then implemented as orientational refinement energy terms in molecular dynamics simulations, leading to a structure for the Schematic representation of the effect of helix geometry upon the dichroisms of three arbitrary vibrations shown in blue, yellow and green. In the left model, the three different vibration transition dipole moments are all equally aligned with respect to the z axis and hence exhibit the same dichroism. However, tilting the helix by the angle b in the middle structure now results in the green mode having the highest dichroism because it is the least tilted with respect to the z axis. Finally, rotation about the helix director by the angle v reverses the dichroism ratio, causing the blue mode to exhibit the highest dichroism.",

The study employed two different peptides, corresponding to the dimeric and the (mutant) monomeric transmembrane domains of the human glycophorin A [32] . Gly79 was exchanged for a glycine in which the two Ca hydrogens were replaced with deuteriums. This enabled the authors to selectively measure the glycine CD 2 stretching frequency and to determine the effects of hydrogen bond formation thereupon. The results of the study show a 6 cm \u00c01 difference between the peak of the monomeric and the dimeric glycine CD 2 stretching mode, indicating that in the dimeric form the methylene group is hydrogen bonded to the C O group in the opposing helix, as predicted [31] .

In addition, 2D IR has the ability to probe the dynamics of molecules in time regimes that are inaccessible to most other methods, providing information on the dynamics of structures and environments down to the femtosecond regime (see Figure 4 ).",

However, two recent studies from the Zanni group on the transmembrane domain of CD3-z demonstrate the promise that the approach possesses. In the first study of a membrane protein by 2D IR [39 ] the authors measured the homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths of the single 13 C 18 O labled site and compared that with the entire peptide amide I (arising from the 12 C 16 O modes). This study was later extended to 11 different 13 C 18 O residues along the entire length of the transmembrane peptide [29 ] . The analysis pointed to the fact that although all sites exhibit the same homogeneous broadening, they differed substantially in their inhomogeneous linewidths. Comparison of experiments with simulations indicate water accessibility of the protein backbone as the primary cause that affects the dynamical behavior of the different sites. The differential water accessibility correlated well with the structural model of the protein [27 ] .",

One obvious limitation that must be considered is the ability to label the target protein. Two categories of proteins should therefore be considered for FTIR analysis: those that can, and those that cannot be made synthetically. Inserting a label into a synthetic protein is trivial -it is simply introduced at will during the synthesis. The problem with this approach is that 'straight-forward' chemical synthesis is limited to proteins smaller than 60-70 residues. However, chemical ligation can be used to extend this upper limit significantly [43] , as shown by the recent total synthesis of functional mechanosensitive channels from Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, containing 136 and 151 residues, respectively [44 ] . Isotopic labeling of proteins that cannot be made synthetically is much more of a challenge. Approaches that have been used to address this technical obstacle are metabolic labeling of unique amino acids [35 ,36 ,37 ] and tRNA engineering [45, 46] .",
