The primary functions can be divided into four major modes and, correspondingly, there are four major modes of alimentary dysfunction. There may be abnormality of motility, secretion, digestion, or absorption. The procedure in diagnosis of alimen tary tract dysfunction should be to determine which mode or modes of function are dis turbed before proceeding to the determina tion of the site and nature of the lesion and ultimately of the specific cause.",

            "text": "The form and function of the small intestine of farm animals are similar between species, but the stomachs and large intestines vary considerably. The motility patterns in both the small and large intestine are similar among the species. In the small intestine, the fundamental unit of electrical activity is the slow wave, which is a subthreshold fluctuation in membrane potential. Slow waves are constantly propagated from the stomach to the rectum. When an additional stimulus causes the membrane potential to exceed the excitation threshold, a spike or electrical response activity occurs, which is usually accompanied by contraction. Almost all spike activity in the intestine is superim posed on slow waves, which are important in controlling frequency and velocity at which spiking events occur. The spiking activity, also known as the migrating myoelectric complex, is the myoelectric pattern in the stomach and small intestine of fasted nonru minants, fed and fasted ruminants, and pigs and horses fed ad libitum. 1 There are three phases of the migrating myoelectric complex: \u2022 Quiescent phase, in which very little spike activity occurs \u2022 Irregular phase, characterized by intermittent spike activity \u2022 Activity front, characterized by intense, continuous spike activity There is very little muscle contraction or transit of gut contents during the quies cent phase. During the irregular phase, con tractions mix the intestinal contents and propel them in an aboral direction. The activity front is accompanied by intense muscular contraction that obliterates the lumen, preventing backflow of content as it propagates, or migrates, down the intestine.",

The most important mechanism is stretching of the wall of the viscus, which stimulates free pain endings of the autonomic nerves in the wall. Contraction does not itself cause pain but does so by causing direct and reflex distension of neighboring segments. Thus spasm, an exaggerated segmenting contrac tion of one section of intestine, will result in distension of the immediately oral segment of intestine when a peristaltic wave arrives. When there is increased motility for any reason, excessive segmentation and peristal sis cause abdominal pain, and the frequent occurrence of intermittent bouts of pain depends on the periodic increases in muscle tone that are typical of the alimentary tract wall. Other factors that have some stimulat ing effect on the pain of end organs are edema and failure of local blood supply, such as occurs in local embolism or in intestinal accidents accompanied by twisting of the mesentery. A secondary mechanism in the production of abdominal pain is the stretch ing and inflammation of serous membranes.",

An important additional factor in the production of shock, when there is distension of alimentary segments, is a marked reflex depression of vasomotor, cardiovascular, and respiratory functions. In diarrhea in calves in which there is no septicemia or toxemia asso ciated with bacteria, the endpoint in the phase of dehydration can be cardiac failure caused by severe metabolic acidosis and elec trolyte abnormalities. Renal ischemia leading to azotemia or uremia can result from decreased circulating blood volume and also contribute to a fatal outcome. These matters are discussed in detail in Chapters 5 and 6.",

If they do occur in farm animals, they have so far only been recog nized as aberrations of motility caused by the defects of secretion. However, it is reasonable to assume that some neonates are deficient in lactase activity, which results in dietetic diarrhea. Undigested lactose causes diarrhea by its hyperosmotic effect, and some of the lactose can be fermented in the large intes tine, the products of which fermentation exaggerates the diarrhea. A deficiency of lactase activity has been suspected in foals affected with diarrhea of undetermined origin when the definitive diagnosis has not been made. The intestinal lactase activity of foals is at its highest level at birth, gradually declines until the fourth month of age, and then disappears from adults before their fourth year.",

For example, in recently weaned pigs, there is villous atrophy with a resulting loss in secretory and absorptive function. Inefficient digestion originating in this way may or may not be manifested by diarrhea, but in malabsorption there is usually diarrhea. There is always failure to grow or maintain body weight (BW), in spite of an apparently normal appetite and an adequate diet. In horses, the lesions associ ated with malabsorption, which can be with or without diarrhea, include villous atrophy, edema and/or necrosis of the lamina propria of the gut wall, and nodular tracts and aggre gations of eosinophils indicating damage by migrating strongyle larvae. Special tests are now detailed for the examination of digestive efficiency in the horse. These are listed in the next section. Increased venous pressure in the portal circuit caused by congestive heart failure or hepatic fibrosis also causes diarrhea. The question of whether or not enteritis in animals causes intestinal hypermotility and increased peristalsis, resulting in diar rhea, remains unresolved. If hypermotility and increased peristalsis cause diarrhea, antimotility drugs may be indicated in some causes of acute infectious diarrhea. Current concepts on the pathophysiology of the com mon diarrheas associated with infectious agents (such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli) indicate that there is a net increase in the flow of intestinal fluid into the lumen and a decrease in outflow back into the sys temic circulation, which causes distension of the intestine with fluid. The hydraulic effect of the distension can cause diarrhea, and hypermotility is probably not necessary. In addition, because of the temporary malab sorption that exists in infectious enteritides, and the presence of infectious agents and enterotoxins in the lumen of the intestine, the emphasis should be on evacuation of the intestinal contents and not on the use of anticholinergic drugs to inhibit evacuation. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the anticho linergics will have any significant effect on the secretoryabsorptive mechanisms that have been altered by an enteropathogen.",

Dynamic or mechanical ileus is a state of physical obstruction. In paralytic ileus there is loss of intestinal tone and motility as a result of reflex inhibition. This can occur in acute peritonitis, excessive handling of viscera during surgery, and prolonged and severe distension of the intestines as in intes tinal obstruction or enteritis. Ileus can also be caused by acidbase imbalance, dehydra tion, electrolyte imbalances such as hypocal cemia and hypokalemia, and toxemia. Ileus can affect the stomach, causing delayed gastric emptying and subsequent dilatation with fluid and gas. The effect of ileus on the intestines is to cause failure of orocaudal movement of fluid, gas, and ingesta and accumulation of these substances, which results in intestinal distension and varying degrees of abdominal pain, dehydration, and a marked reduction in the amount of feces. Distension of the abdomen, fluidtinkling, fluidsplashing sounds, and pings on percus sion of the abdomen are common clinical findings. Impaction of the large intestine of horses is a form of ileus. Postoperative ileus of the small and large intestines is a common complication of surgical treatment for colic in the horse. 25 The clinical findings include gastric reflux because of gastric distension with fluid, absence of or minimal intestinal peristaltic sounds, an absence of feces, abdominal pain, distended loops of intestine palpable per rectum, and varying degrees of shock and dehydration as a result of intestinal fluid sequestration and a decrease in fluid absorp tion. Infarction of the intestinal wall associ ated with an acute mechanical obstruction of the intestine also results in ileus.

Passage of a stomach tube into the rumen will determine the patency of the esophagus and if there is increased intraruminal pres sure associated with a frothy or freegas bloat. In a freegas bloat, large quantities of gas are usually released within a minute. In a frothy bloat, the ruminal end of the tube may become occluded by the froth and very little if any gas is released. Moving the tube back and forth within the rumen and blowing air into the tube to clear the ruminal end may result in the release of some gas.",

            "text": "When the tube is in the rumen, some rumen juice can be siphoned or pumped out and collected in an open beaker for field and laboratory analysis. The color, depend ing on the feed to a limited extent, will be green, olivegreen or browngreen. In cattle on pasture or being fed good quality hay, the color is dark green. When silage or straw is the diet the color is yellow-brown. In grain overload the color is milky gray, and in rumen stasis of long duration with putrefaction, the color is greenish-black. The consistency of the rumen contents is normally slightly viscid, and watery rumen content is indicative of inactive bacteria and protozoa. Excess froth is associated with frothy bloat as in primary ruminal tympany or vagus indigestion. The odor of the rumen contents is normally aromatic and, although somewhat pungent, not objectionable to the nose. A moldy, rotting odor usually indi cates protein putrefaction, and an intensely sour odor indicates an excess of lactic acid for mation caused by grain or carbohydrate engorgement. The pH of the rumen juice varies according to the type of feed and the time interval between the last feeding and taking a sample for pH examination. The normal range, however, is between 6.2 and 7.2. The pH of rumen juice should be examined immediately after the sample is obtained, using a wide range pH (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) paper. High pH values (8) (9) (10) will be observed when putrefaction of protein is occurring in the rumen or if the sample is mixed with saliva. Low pH values (4) (5) are found after the feeding of carbohydrates. Generally, a pH below 5 indicates carbohydrate engorgement; this pH level will be maintained between 6 and 24 hours after the animal has actually consumed the car bohydrate diet. Microscopic examination of a few drops of rumen fluid on a glass slide with a lowpower field will reveal the level of protozoon activity. Normally five to seven protozoans are active per low power field. In lactic acidosis the proto zoa are usually absent or a few dead ones are visible.",

In vagus indiges tion, the rumen may be grossly distended with fluid contents, which will gush out through a largebore tube. In some cases 100 to 150 L of rumen contents may be released. If no contents are released the contents may be frothy or mushy and the rumen end of the tube will plug almost instantly. Rumen lavage may then be attempted using a water hose to deliver 20 to 40 L of water at a time followed by back drainage using gravity flow.

Insufflation of the stomach is essential for a thorough examination, although it has been associated with segmental volvulus in a small number of cases. 28 A complete examination of the stomach is important, and the presence or absence of squamous ulceration cannot be used as a predictor for the presence or absence of glandular ulceration. 27 Observation of the squamous mucosa is relatively easy, whereas passage through to the pyloric antrum is more technically demanding. However, observation of the pyloric antrum is critical because the majority of glandular ulceration occurs in this region. 2931 Observation of the most ventral portion of the fundus is typi cally not possible because of the presence of fluid.

Concentration of the metabolite or marker of interest in blood is plotted against time, and the shape of the curve, highest concentration attained, time to attain the highest concen tration, and elevation over baseline values (i.e., those measured immediately before administration of the test meal) are com pared against values obtained from clinically normal horses or foals. Blood concentrations of glucose or xylose that are lower than expected (so called \"flat curve\") can be indic ative of alterations in gastrointestinal func tion that hinder propulsion, digestion, or absorption of nutrients. Thus tests of diges tion and absorption alone rarely provided sufficient information to make a definitive diagnosis of the functional disorder. The exception to this rule is the modified lactose tolerance test in foals (see later). Interpreta tion of the results of oral tests of absorption is often confounded by factors that alter gastrointestinal function, such as feed with holding or enteritis or conditions that alter removal of the test compound from blood like reduced insulin sensitivity. This is par ticularly the case for tests that depend on measurement of blood glucose concentra tion. Blood glucose concentrations are deter mined in the absorptive state by the difference in rates of absorption of glucose from the small intestine into blood and removal of glucose from blood by uptake into muscle, adipose tissue, and metabolically active tissues. Conditions that enhance glucose uptake from the blood can result in low peak blood glucose concentrations, and conditions that decrease insulin sensitivity (as is seen in fat horses) can result in high blood glucose concentrations. The use of dxylose as an indicator of smallintestinal absorption is intended to avoid these effects of variable glucose disposal. Therefore the values obtained with oral tests of absorption and digestion should be interpreted with caution and should be considered in light of all clinical and laboratory data available for the animal. Sedation does not affect dxylose uptake in horses. 32 ",

Fermentation of lactose in the hind gut causes acute and sometimes severe osmotic diarrhea.

In humans the ability to hydrolyze lactose is one of the first functions of the intestinal mucosa to be lost in which there is epithelial damage in the gut. It is also one of the last functions to return in the recovering patient. The loss of intestinal lactase may be the pathogenetic basis of the diarrhea that occurs in rotavirus infections in neonates.

This appears to be of major importance only if there are loops of distended atonic intestine situated on the ventral abdominal wall. This is a common occurrence in the later stages of intestinal obstruction that is still amenable to surgery. Puncture of a devitalized loop of intestine may cause a leakage of intestinal contents and acute diffuse peritonitis, which is rapidly fatal. Penetration of a normal loop of intestine occurs often enough to lead to the conclusion that it appears to have no ill effects. If a sample of peritoneal fluid is an important diagnostic need in a particular case, and the first attempt at paracentesis causes penetration of the gut, it is recommended that the attempt be repeated, if necessary two or three times, at more posterior sites. Repeated abdominocen tesis does not cause alterations in peritoneal fluid constituents, and any significant changes are likely caused by alterations in the disease state present. The technique most likely to cause bowel penetration is the use of a sharp needle instead of the blunt cannula recom mended, and forcibly thrusting the cannula through the linea alba without a prior inci sion.

A teat cannula similar to the one described for use in the horse is recommended but, with care and caution, a 16gauge 5cm hypodermic needle may also be used. The needle or cannula is pushed carefully and slowly through the abdominal wall, which will twitch when the peritoneum is punctured.

In gastric or intestinal obstruction, or when diarrhea is severe, it is necessary to replace lost fluids and electrolytes by the parenteral administra tion of large quantities of isotonic glucosesaline or other physiologically normal electrolyte solutions. The amount of fluid lost may be very large and fluids must be given in quantities to replace losses and to support continuing losses and maintenance require ments. In acute, severe dehydration in horses, such as occurs in acute intestinal obstruction, the amount of fluid required before and during surgery ranges from 50 to 100 mL/kg BW per 24 hours. It is critical that adminis tration of fluid is commenced at the earliest possible time because of the need to maintain homeostasis. Details of fluid therapy are given in Chapter 5. In young animals the need is much greater still and amounts of 100 mL/kg BW, given slowly intravenously, are commonly necessary and not excessive. The treatment of shock is also presented in Chapters 2 and 9 and includes the administration of fluids, plasma or blood, and nonsteroidal antiin flammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Broken mouth is a chronic inflammatory disease of the tissue supports of the tooth. Between 60% and 70% of ewes sold at slaugh ter in England and Scotland have loose or missing incisor teeth. Broken mouth is geo graphically specific and it seems that once the disease is established on a particular farm, the animals are permanently suscepti ble. Many sheep are culled before the end of their useful reproductive life because of broken mouth. The problem is particularly severe in New Zealand and the hill country in Scotland. The cause is uncertain, but envi ronmental factors that result in periodontal disease are probably important. Broken mouth is associated with abnormal bacterial flora in the mouth with affected sheep having a preponderance of Mannheimia ruminalis and Moraxella caprae compared with sheep with healthy mouths. 2 Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis, an organism that is found in plaque from sheep's teeth, has been found with increased frequency in diseased com pared with unaffected animals. The depths of the gingival crevice of sheep are heritable and it is possible that deeper crevices may already be harboring greater numbers of periodontally pathogenic bacteria so that when the animals are exposed to a broken mouth environment they may be more prone to the changes. Although nutrition and mineral deficiencies influence dental devel opment and tooth eruption of sheep, there is no significant difference in calcium or phos phorus status between control and affected populations of sheep. Low planes of nutrition have delayed eruption of the permanent den tition and retarded mandibular growth, but these changes are not seen in broken mouth in sheep. The occurrence of this periodontal disease is higher in some soil types than on others. The ingestion of irritating materials such as sand and spiny grass seeds has been suggested as causes, but they are considered to be secondary complications in a preexist ing disease. Another dental disease of sheep is also recorded on an extensive scale in New Zealand. There is excessive wear of decidu ous incisors but no change in the rate of wear of the molar teeth. The incisor wear is epi sodic and is not caused by any change in the supportive tissues, and there is no change in the intrinsic resistance to wear of the incisor teeth. The disease is not related to an inade quate dietary intake of copper or vitamin D and is thought to be caused by the ingestion of soil particles. The two New Zealand dis eases do not occur together and have no apparent effect on body condition score.",

This subsides leaving a chronic gingivitis and an accumulation of subgingival plaque. On some farms, for reasons not understood, this gingivitis penetrates down into the alveoli, causing a severe periodontitis and eventual shedding of the teeth. The severity of the gin givitis can vary between farms. The disease is episodic in nature, with discrete acute inflammatory incidents leading to periodon tal injury that may resolve by healing. The balance between repair and the various short and longterm acute episodes proba bly accounts for the large variation in inci dence and age onset of tooth loss both within and between flocks. The inflammatory peri odontal disease markedly affects the tooth's mobility. Collagen fibrils supporting the tooth become abnormal. The deepened peri odontal pocket resulting from inflammation removes the major area of support for the tooth and abnormal loads are applied to fibers deeper within the tissue. Although the incisor teeth are usually most severely affected, the cheek teeth are also involved. In some unusual circumstances the gingivitis appears to arise from heavy deposits of dental calculus.

Several dental health indices can assist to assess the amount of gingivitis, tooth move ment, gum recession, and pocketing. Gingi vitis is characterized by redness and edema of the attached gingiva. Bleeding from the gingivae is also a feature. Clinical gingivitis is evident as soon as the permanent teeth erupt. Chronic gingivitis results in a down ward retreat of the gum margin; loss of its normal, scalloped shape; and fibrosis of the gingiva. Within a year before tooth loss, tissue damage around the incisors leads to deepening of the gingival sulcus and the for mation of pockets, which are readily detected by the use of graduated dental measuring probes. The normal sulcus is 0.5 to 1.0 mm deep labially and up to 4 mm deep lingually; pockets may be over 1.0 cm in depth before tooth loss.

The important decision is whether to proceed and risk damaging the esophagus or wait and allow the esophageal spasm to relax and the obstruction to pass spontaneously. This problem is most impor tant in the horse. Attempts to push the obstruction too vigorously can injure the mucosa, causing esophagitis and even esoph ageal perforation. Alternatively, leaving a large obstruction in place can restrict blood flow to the local area of mucosa and result in ischemic necrosis. Complications such as strictures and diverticula can occur but are uncommon.

Return of the fluid through the oral cavity and nostrils is minimized by ensuring that the tube is not plugged by returning material and by using only small quantities of fluid for each input of the lavage. Throughout the procedure, the tube is gently manipulated against the impac tion. The use of a transparent tube assists in helping to see the amount and nature of the material coming through the tube. This is repeated many times until the fluid becomes clear. This procedure can require a few hours, but perseverance will be successful. After each lavage the tube can be advanced caudad a few centimeters and eventually all the way to the stomach. Care must be taken to avoid overflowing the esophagus and causing aspi ration into the lungs. This is a constant hazard whenever irrigative removal is attempted and the animal's head must always be kept as low as possible to avoid aspiration.

Generally, when lesions of the large intestine predominate, the fluid and electrolyte losses are not as acute or as severe as when the lesions of the small intes tine predominate.

The total amount of fluid entering the large intestine from the small intestine, plus the amount entering from the mucosa of the large intestine, is equal to the animal's total extracellular fluid volume, and 95% of this is reabsorbed by the large intestine. This illustrates the major importance of the large intestine of the horse in absorbing a large quantity of fluid originating from saliva, the stomach, liver, pancreas, and small and large intestine. Any significant dysfunction of the absorptive mechanism of the large intestine of the horse results in large losses of fluids and electrolytes.

The degree of recession of the eyeball is also a useful aid. In the early stages of acute enter itis, the degree of clinical dehydration may be underestimated because of the time required for fluid to shift from the interstitial and intracellular spaces to the intravascular space to replace fluids already lost. Dehydra tion is usually evident by 10 to 12 hours fol lowing the onset of acute enteritis and clinically obvious by 18 to 24 hours.

The question of whether or not a normally digestible diet should be removed temporarily or the total daily intake reduced in animals with acute enteritis is a difficult one. The rationale is that in acute enteritis the digestibility of nutrients is reduced considerably and undigested feed provides a substrate for fermentation and putrefaction to occur, the products of which may accentuate the malabsorptive state. However, temporary withdrawal of feed presents practical problems, especially in the young. For example, the temporary removal from the sow of newborn piglets affected with acute enteritis presents practical prob lems and is of doubtful value, which is similar with beef calves nursing cows on pasture. With foals it is relatively easy to muzzle them for 24 hours. With weaned piglets affected with weanling diarrhea and feeder pigs with swine dysentery, it is common practice to reduce the normal daily intake by half for a few days until recovery is apparent. Mature horses affected with diar rhea should not have access to any feed for at least 24 hours. During the period of tem porary starvation, the oral intake of fluids containing glucose and electrolytes is desir able and necessary to assist in maintaining hydration. In newborn calves with diarrhea, if oral fluid intake is maintained, the total loss of water from feces and through the kidney is not significantly greater than in normal calves, because in diarrheic calves the kidney will effectively compensate for fecal losses.

Under ideal conditions when a labora tory is available, the determination of PCV, total serum proteins, plasma bicarbonate, blood pH, serum electrolytes, and a hemo gram would provide the clinician with a laboratory evaluation initially and through out the course of therapy to assess the effec tiveness of the treatment. However, such laboratory service is expensive and usually not readily available.

The net effect is an increase in resistance to passage of intestinal contents, and more complete absorption of both water and nutri ents occurs with a subsequent decrease in the frequency of defecation.

The hard masses of necrotic fat that occur relatively commonly in the peritoneal cavity of adult cattle, espe cially the Channel Island breeds and possibly Aberdeen Angus, are commonly mistaken for a developing fetus and can cause intesti nal obstruction. The latter usually develops slowly, resulting in the appearance of attacks of moderate abdominal pain and the passage of small amounts of feces. Many cases are detected during routine rectal examination of normal animals. The lipomatous masses are located in the small and large omentum and mesentery in cattle and more diffusely to other parts of the body in sheep and goats. The composition of the fatty deposits is iden tical with the fat of normal cows and there is no suggestion that the disease is neoplastic. Sporadic cases are most common but there are reports of a herd prevalence as high as 67%. The cause is unknown, but there appears to be a relationship between such high prevalence and the grazing of tall fescue grass, and an inherited predisposition is sug gested. The rate of occurrence increases with age with the peak occurrence at 7 years of age. It has been suggested that excessive fat tiness of abdominal adipose tissue may pre dispose cattle to fat necrosis. An unusual form of the disease with many lesions in sub cutaneous sites has been recorded in Hol stein Friesian cattle and is regarded as being inherited.

The resulting tox emia is the most important factor in the pro duction of clinical illness, and its severity is usually governed by the size of the area of peritoneum involved. In acute diffuse peritonitis, the toxemia is profound, but in local inflammation, it is negligible. The type of infection present is obviously important because of variations between bacteria in their virulence and toxin production. With rupture of the alimentary tract wall and the spillage of a large quantity of gut contents into the peritoneal cavity, some acute peritonitis does develop, but death is usually too sudden, within 2 to 3 hours in horses, for more than an early lesion to develop. These animals die of endotoxic shock caused by absorption of toxins from the gut contents. In acute diffuse peritonitis caused solely by bacterial contamination from the gut, the reaction depends on the bacteria that gain entry, the capacity of the omentum to deal with the peritonitis, and the amount of body movement that the animal has to perform. Cows that suffer pen etration of the reticular wall at calving have lowered immunologic competence, a greater than normal negative pressure in the perito neal cavity; are invaded by F. necrophorum, Corynebacterium spp., and E. coli; and are required to walk to the milking parlor, to the feed supply, and so on. They are likely to develop a massive diffuse purulent peri tonitis and a profound toxemia and die within 24 hours. In contrast, horses that develop acute peritonitis from streptococci or A. equuli show little toxemia and manifest only abdominal pain caused by the inflam matory reaction of the peritoneum.",

After abdominal surgery, dif ferentiation between septic peritonitis and other postoperative complications can be difficult using physical and hematological findings alone. As a result of the exploratory process itself, diagnosis of septic peritonitis is often complicated in horses after surgery because the total nucleated cell count and protein concentration in the peritoneal fluid are often high. Consequently, identification of bacteria on cytologic evaluation or isola tion of bacteria from peritoneal fluid is a more definitive indicator of septic peritoni tis, but sometimes there are falsenegative results. Although bacterial cultures are con sidered the standard criterion for the diagno sis of sepsis, positive results may not always be obtained and results may be delayed by a minimum of 24 hours for aerobic organisms and up to 10 to 14 days for anaerobic organ isms. Thus ancillary tests such as pH, glucose concentrations, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in equine pleural and syno vial fluid have been used to detect sepsis with the potential advantages of speed, ease of measurement, and lower cost relative to bac terial cultures.",

The conflicting results might be the result of varying study populations, study design, presence of varying confounding factors, and interpretation of data. Confounding factors are those that alter with the age of the horse, such as use, feeding, and management of horses, and mask an effect of age or give the impression of an effect of age when in fact such an effect is not present. Horses 2 to 10 years of age are 2.8 times more likely to develop colic that horses less than 2 years. One largescale study reported that foals less than 6 months of age had an incidence of 0.2 cases of colic per 100 horses per year, whereas horses more than 6 months of age had an incidence of approximately 4 to 6 colic affected horses per 100 horse years, with the incidence varying to a limited extent among older age groups. The mortality rate varies widely among insured horses in Japan, with a much higher incidence of death from colic in older horses: 9% in horses >21 years of age compared with 1.5% in foals and yearlings. 5 Other studies have not found a similar effect of age. However, each age group has a par ticular set of diseases unique or common to it. Newborn foals can have congenital colon or anal atresia or meconium impaction (see the section Colic in Foals), diseases that do not affect older horses, whereas strangulat ing or obstructive lesions caused by pedun culated lipomas are found only in older horses.",

The absorptive function of the intes tine may be decreased by inflammation or ischemia, which results in distension of the small intestine or large colon, pain, and potentially rupture of the stomach or colon. Impairment of the barrier function of the gastrointestinal mucosa by inflammation or ischemia can result in leakage of endotoxin and other toxic compounds into peritoneal fluid with subsequent endotoxemia , , toxemia, and systemic inflammatory response syn drome (see the section Endotoxemia).",

Detection of colonic mesenteric vessels in an abnormal location (lateral or ventral to the colon) is strongly associated with a diagnosis of colon displacement or volvulus. 32, 39 Ultrasonographic detection of smallintestinal distension is more sensitive than is rectal examination. (Fig. 71 , A-D 33 ). Abdominal ultrasonography can be used for the accurate definitive diagnosis of some smallintestinal and largeintestinal diseases. Distended and nonmotile small intestinal loops are associated with strangu lated obstruction. Failure to visualize the left kidney is associated with renosplenic entrap ment, and thickened large colon is associated with strangulating volvulus. 40 Ultrasonographic examination reveals colon with a mural thickness of 9 mm or greater in horses with colon torsion. The test has a sensitivity of approximately 67% (i.e., correctly predicts the presence of colon torsion in twothirds of horses that have the disease) and specificity of 100% (correctly rules out the diagnosis in 100% of horses that do not have the disease). Similarly, ultraso nography has a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 98% for detection of dilated small intestine. 33 The abdomen should be examined in a systematic fashion with a 2.0 to 3.5mHz transducer, and a procedure allowing rapid examination of the abdomen of horses has been proposed (Table 714 ). 33 The value of this protocol is that it ensures a systematic and thorough examination of the abdomen and thorax for signs of the cause of colic. The normal ultrasonographic anatomy of equids is described. 34 ",

Referral should be sooner if there is evidence of compromised cardiovascular function, or any of the signs described next. \u2022 Recurrent attacks of colic over a period as long as several months. \u2022 Failure of an efficient analgesic to provide analgesia or relief for at least 20 minutes. \u2022 A rectally palpable lesion including distended small intestine, large colon, or small colon, or impaction of the large colon that does not resolve in 24 hours. \u2022 Reflux of more than 4 L of fluid through a nasogastric tube. \u2022 Abdominal distension. \u2022 Bloodtinged, highprotein peritoneal fluid with a high white cell count. \u2022 A rapid worsening of the pain and vital signs during a period of 2 to 4 hours Not all of these criteria need to be fulfilled to warrant a decision to refer, and in most cases the presence of one of these findings is suf ficient to justify a recommendation to the owner to refer the horse for further evalua tion and specialized care. Important in the decision to refer, or to perform a laparotomy, is the client's under standing of the costs involved and the likely outcomes. Because decisions to refer are often complicated by the emotional pressures on the owner and the need to make a decision quickly, it is important to take the time to fully inform the owner of the likely costs and outcomes before a final commitment is made to refer. If there is doubt-refer it!",

The survival rate for horses undergoing surgical correc tion of lesions depends on the nature and location of the underlying disease and its duration. However, survival rates range from 50% to 75%, with approximately twothirds of horses returning to their intended use. 62 The survival rate of horses with smallintes tinal lesions is less than that of horses with largeintestinal disease, and the survival rate for horses with strangulating disease is much less than that of horses with nonstrangulat ing disease. 59 Thoroughbred racehorses that return to racing after colic surgery do so successfully. 63",

Progestins are sometimes administered in an attempt to prevent abor tion of mares after resolution of colic, but there is evidence of their lack of efficacy in this respect. 4 The risk of abortion in mares with colic is partially dependent on the severity of the colic and it cause, necessity for surgical inter vention, the duration of colic, and the stage of gestation. 36 Abortion rates in pregnant mares treated for colic at referral institutions vary from ~20% to 50% depending on the particular disease. 36 Severely ill mares with signs of toxemia have abortion rates of almost 70%, whereas mares with less severe disease have abortion rates of 8% to 18%, which is not markedly different from the rate in mares without colic. 3 Mares treated surgically have a greater relative risk of abortion (3.5, 95% CI 1.7-7.3) than mares treated medically.

Other causes include insufficient access to water, poor teeth causing poor digestion, or the atony of old age. Some affected horses have histologic abnormalities of the stomach or intestine, but the clinical importance of these lesions in development of the disease is unclear. 1, 2 Horses can present with acute, chronic, or recurrent colic. Horses with acute disease usually have clinical signs of <3 days' dura tion, and half have had previous episodes of colic. 2 The most common clinical sign is inappetence with or without colic. 1,2 Heart rate and respiratory rate are usually not markedly elevated and rectal examination does not reveal diagnostic abnormalities. If the stomach has ruptured, there will be signs of septic peritonitis with toxemia and cardio vascular compromise including sweating, tachycardia, delayed mucous membrane cap illary refill time, and discolored mucous membranes. Signs of longterm (chronic) disease include weight loss; intermittent colic; anorexia; dullness; and passage of small amounts of hard, dry feces. Gastroscopy confirms the diagnosis by visualization of large amounts of ingesta in the stomach or phytobezoars, although visu alization of the stomach is impaired by the presence of large quantities of ingesta causing the impaction. At exploratory laparotomy the stomach is enlarged with dry, fibrous feed material but is not grossly or acutely distended, and the intestines are relatively empty.",

It is assumed that ulcers occur because of an imbalance between the erosive capability of the low gastric pH and the protective mechanisms of the gastric mucosa. Low gastric pH was considered essential for the devel opment of a gastric ulcer, but there is less certainty about this now that it is recog nized that critically ill foals, and especially those that are premature or recumbent, often have high (less acid to alkaline) and highly variable gastric pH. 5 Additionally, administration of omeprazole to wean lings is effective in reducing the prevalence of lesions of the gastric squamous mucosa but might worsen lesions of the glandular mucosa. 1 The conventional wisdom is that preser vation of adequate mucosal blood flow and the presence of an intact, bicarbonaterich layer of mucus over the epithelium are essen tial to maintaining the resistance of the epi thelium to digestion by gastric acid and pepsin. Mucosal blood flow and bicarbonate secretion into the protective mucous layer are dependent in part on normal prostaglan din E concentrations in the mucosa. Factors that inhibit prostaglandin E production, such as NSAIDs and ischemia, could con tribute to the development of ulcers. Trauma to the gastric epithelium can disrupt the pro tective layer and allow an ulcer to develop, as can the presence of compounds in duodenal fluid, such as bile salts that intermittently reflux into the stomach of normal foals.",

These lesions are very common in foals less than 60 days of age and usually do not cause clinical signs. The lesions heal without treatment and are now considered variations of normal. 4 2. Ulceration of the squamous epithelium of the lesser curvature and fundus. This is more common in older foals (>60 days) and is sometimes associated with clinical signs including diarrhea, inappetence, and colic. 3. Ulceration of the glandular mucosa, sometimes extending into the pylorus. This lesion occurs in foals of any age and is most common in foals with a comorbid disease. Clinical signs caused by the ulcer can be severe and include teeth grinding, excessive salivation, inappetence, colic, and diarrhea. There is often reflux esophagitis. 4. Gastric outflow obstruction caused by pyloric or duodenal stricture secondary to pyloric or duodenal ulceration. This occurs in 2 to 5monthold foals and is evident as colic, inappetence, weight loss, gastric dilatation, gastroesophageal reflux, excessive salivation, and teeth grinding. 5. Peracute peritonitis secondary to gastric perforation. This usually occurs in foals that do not have a history of signs of gastric ulceration. Clinical signs include unexpected death, shock, dehydration, sweating, and an increased respiratory rate. 6. Hemorrhagic shock secondary to blood loss into the gastrointestinal tract from a bleeding gastric ulcer. This is an unusual presentation. 7. The typical signs of gastric ulcers in foals include depression, teeth grinding, excessive salivation, and abdominal pain that can range in intensity from very mild to acute and severe, similar to that of a foal with an acute intestinal accident. Diarrhea, with or without mild to moderate abdominal pain, is often associated with gastric ulcer disease in foals. Treatment with antiulcer drugs is sometimes associated with resolution of diarrhea and signs of gastric ulcer disease. There might be pain evinced by deep palpation of the cranial abdomen, but this is not a reliable diagnostic sign. Definitive diagnosis is provided by gastroscopic examination. The endoscope should be 2 m in length, although a 1m endoscope might allow partial examination of the stomach of young or small foals. Diameter of the endoscope should be less than 1 cm. Foals can usually be examined without sedation, although sedation might facilitate examination in larger or fractious foals. Ideally, older foals should have food withheld for 12 hours before the examina tion but this might not be necessary or advis able in sick foals. Young foals (those relying on milk intake for their caloric needs) should have food withheld for 1 to 2 hours. Ade quate examination of the nonglandular stomach can usually be achieved without fasting, especially in younger foals, but thor ough examination of the glandular mucosa and pylorus requires fasting.",

These drugs are either histamine type 2 (H 2 ) receptor antagonists or inhibitors of the proton pump in the gastric parietal cells. Administration of ranitidine (6.6 mg/kg orally every 8 hour) effectively increases gastric pH in normal neonatal foals but does not affect gastric pH in hospitalized neonates. 3 Omeprazole (4 mg/kg orally every 24 hours), a proton pump inhibitor, increases gastric pH within 2 hours of administration and for 24 hours in clinically normal neonatal foals and in clinically ill neonatal foals. 7 Omeprazole enhances healing of spontaneous ulcers in foals older than 28 days and is usually con sidered to not have important or frequent adverse effects. However, recent evidence suggests that administration of omeprazole to clinically normal weanlings is associated with increased severity of lesions in the glan dular mucosa. 1 Sucralfate is used to provide protection of denuded gastric epithelium, although its efficacy in preventing lesions or enhancing healing of existing lesions in foals with spon taneous disease is doubted. A common treatment protocol involves administration of an H 2 antagonist or omeprazole. Treatment should begin as soon as the presence of a clinically relevant ulcer is suspected and should continue for at least 1 week after the resolution of clinical signs or until there is endoscopic confirma tion of healing. Foals are often treated for 2 to 6 weeks.",

Helicobacter DNA was detected by PCR in a similar pro portion of lesions and in one of the two horses that did not have lesions.

The frequency with which gastric ulcers are detected depends on the method of examination, the group of horses examined, and the reasons for examining them. It is not uncommon for studies of large numbers of horses (>100) to report prevalence of gastric ulcers equal to or greater than 80%, although this is not uni versal. 8, 9 Studies reporting on incidence of gastric ulceration in horses with clinical abnormalities or at necropsy revealed a high frequency of gastric lesions in horses with colic (49%). 10 More recent studies have examined large numbers of horses without clinical signs of gastric ulcer disease but from populations at risk and have demonstrated a high prevalence in horses undertaking stren uous exercise on a regular basis. 9, 1113 Gastric ulcer disease in horses is a recently recognized disease, with most reports origi nating after 1990 and coinciding with the widespread availability of endoscopes of suf ficient length to permit examination of the stomach of adult horses. However, a longitu dinal study of horses submitted for postmor tem examination in Sweden demonstrated that horses have been affected with gastric ulcers since 1924. 14 The condition is common in racehorses and other breeds of horse used for athletic events, and this population represents the most important occurrence of the disease. That said, less active horses and horses on pasture can be affected and with relatively high prevalence. 3, 11, 15, 16 Broodmares on pas ture can have a high prevalence of gastric ulcers (71%, 44 of 62 horses examined) with 42 of the 44 affected horses having ulcers only in the squamous mucosa. 16 There was no difference in prevalence of ulcers between pregnant and nonpregnant mares or between pregnant and recently foaled mares. 16 The presence of ulcers was not correlated with the weight of foals or placenta, raising the issue of the clinical importance of the pres ence of the ulcers. Over 60% of a nonrandom selection of horses kept on pasture in Den mark had gastric ulcer lesions \u22652. 3 Thoroughbred and Standardbred horses in training or racing have a high prevalence of gastric lesions. 8, 9, 11, 12 Gastroscopic studies of convenience samples of clinically normal Thoroughbred racehorses in training reveal a prevalence of lesions of the gastric mucosa of 82% to 93%. Gastric lesions are detected in 52% to 87% of Standardbred horses in training and actively racing. 9 Postmortem examination of Thoroughbred racehorses in Hong Kong, where many horses that retire from racing are examined postmortem, reveals a prevalence of gastric lesions of 66%, with the prevalence increasing to 80% when only horses that had raced recently were con sidered. Among racehorses selected for gas troscopic examination because of clinical abnormalities, including inappetence, failure to race to expectation, poor hair coat, or poor body condition, lesions of the gastric mucosa were detected in 86% to 90%. 14 Lesions of the gastric mucosa occur in approximately 80% of endurance horses between racing seasons and in over 90% during racing. 13 Gastric lesions were present in 58% of show horses that had competed in the 30 days before gastroscopic examination. 14",

For instance, being in training often coin cides with confined housing, intermittent feeding, daily bouts of strenuous exercise, and administration of NSAIDs. The combi nation of these factors, even without NSAID administration, reliably induces ulcers in Thoroughbred racehorses.

Horses with gastric lesions are more likely to have a nervous disposition, exacerbated stress hormone response to novel stimuli, and to paw more frequently. 17 Nonsteroidal antiin flammatory drugs are ulcerogenic at high doses and often administered to horses in training. The impact of NSAIDs on gastric permeability varies among drugs, 19 although the risk of any NSAIDs causing gastric ulcers at doses effective for treatment of musculo skeletal pain appears to be minimal. 5 Fur thermore, among Thoroughbred racehorses there is no clear association between admin istration of these drugs and the risk of having gastric lesions. 14, 17 Colic is associated with presence of gastric lesions, although a cause and effect relationship is often not clear in individual cases. In a series of 111 horses with clinical evidence of abdominal discomfort of varying duration and severity, 91 had endoscopic evi dence of gastric ulceration. Other abnormali ties of the gastrointestinal tract or abdominal viscera were not found in 57 of the 91 horses with gastric ulcers.

However, 34 of the 91 horses with gastric ulceration had concurrent abnormalities of the gastro intestinal tract, demonstrating that gastric lesions can develop in horses with colic.

The stratified squamous epithelial mucosa has minimal resistance to gastric acid. The glandular epithelium has elaborate mechanisms, including the mucus-bicar bonate barrier, prostaglandins, mucosal blood flow, and cellular restitution, to protect itself from peptic injury. Hydrochloric acid and pepsinogens, which are converted to the proteolytic enzyme pepsin in an acidic envi ronment, are secreted in the glandular mucosa by parietal cells and chief cells, respectively. The horse is a continuous, vari able hydrochloric acid secretor, and the pH of equine gastric contents in the pylorus and antrum is often less than 2.0. Gastric pH is lowest, and acidity highest, when horses have been deprived of feed or have voluntarily stopped eating, often for as little as 2 hours. Thus there are periods during the day when gastric acidity is high (notably during the nighttime hours from midnight to 9 am). 15, 21 Periods of prolonged high gastric acidity (pH <2.0) can be induced in horses by intermit tent deprivation of feed, which often results in severe ulceration in the gastric squamous epithelial mucosa.

The lesion deepens and progresses from an erosion to ulceration, exposing unprotected tissue to acid contents. 22 Subsequent healing might occur depending on factors influenc ing acidity and healing capabilities of the individual animal. 22 Exposure of squamous mucosa to acid is probably involved in the development of ulcers in most horses and there is in vitro evidence that volatile fatty acids, in combination with hydrochloric acid, are important in the development of ulcers in the nonglandular mucosa. 23 A particular circumstance appears to favor the development of gastritis and ulcer ation in horses that undertake intense exer cise. During exercise intragastric pressure increases from approximately 14 mm Hg at rest to as high as 50 mm Hg, stomach volume decreases, and the acidity of fluid within the proximal part of the stomach declines from pH 5 to 7 to pH 2 to 4. The combination of reduced blood flow and exposure to low pH increases the likelihood of mucosal damage, loss of protective mechanisms, and develop ment of gastric mucosal lesions. 14 Other factors, including physical injury to gastric mucosa, reflux of bile acids from the duodenum, and the presence of volatile fatty acids in the stomach all can contribute to the development of gastric lesions, but the definitive roles, if any, of each of these factors have not been determined.",

Gastro scopic examination of the adult horse requires an endoscope of at least 2.5 m in length, although 3 m is preferable. The pres ence of feed material within the stomach prevents complete examination of the gastric mucosa, and in particular of the pylorus and antrum. The horse should be prepared by having feed withheld for at least 12 hours and water withheld for 4 hours before examination. If the horse is stabled on edible material, such as straw or shavings, it should be muzzled to prevent it eating this material. The horse may need to be sedated before examination (xylazine hydrochloride 0.1-0.3 mg/kg intravenously) and a twitch applied. The gastric mucosa is examined in a systematic fashion. As the end of the endo scope passes through the cardia the greater curvature and margo plicatus are examined. The endoscope is then advanced and rotated so that the lesser curvature and cardia are examined. The stomach should be inflated with air during the procedure. Excess fluid in the pylorus and antrum can be aspirated to allow better visualization of these regions. Careful attention should be paid to the margo plicatus because this is the most common site for lesions. The gastric glandu lar mucosa should be examined carefully for lesions because they are easily missed in this region. Material adherent to the mucosa should be washed away by flushing water through the endoscope. The endoscope can be passed into the duodenum to permit com plete examination of the antrum. Endoscopic examination usually underestimates the number of gastric ulcers, compared with necropsy examination, and does not accu rately predict the severity or depth of ulcers.",

The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of the drug have been extensively investigated in horses under a variety of conditions and management systems. Omeprazole (4 mg/kg BW orally every 24 hours) is effective in promoting healing of ulcers of the squamous mucosa in horses that continue to train or race, a situa tion in which ulcers will not heal spontane ously. Omeprazole is safe and no adverse effects from its administration have been reported. Omeprazole at a dosage of 4.0 mg/ kg once daily is more effective at healing ulcers of both the squamous and glandular portions of the stomach than is a dosage of 0.8 mg/kg. 29 However, omeprazole is less efficacious at healing ulcers of the glandular mucosa than the squamous mucosa. 29 A fre quently used treatment regimen is omepra zole 4 mg/kg once daily for 14 days followed by maintenance therapy of 1 to 2 mg/kg once daily for as long as the horse is at risk of developing gastric ulcers. Administration of omeprazole (4 mg/kg once daily either before or after exercise) resulted in healing of 80% of squamous ulcers versus 21% of glandular ulcers (P = 0.0002), and improve ment in 96% of squamous ulcers versus 53% of glandular ulcers (P = 0.001). 30 Omeprazole paste administered at 1 mg/kg orally once daily is effective in both pre venting development of ulcers in horses entering race training and preventing recur rence of ulcers in horses in which ulcers have healed during treatment with a higher dose of omeprazole. 31, 32 Omeprazole (0.5 mg/kg once daily) is as efficacious as 1 mg/kg once daily in treating Thoroughbred racehorses with ulcers in training. However, there was no untreated control group, or group admin istered a higher dose of omeprazole, and results might have reflected healing that could be expected without medication. 33 Administration of omeprazole (1 mg/kg) as an entericcoated formulation is as effective as administration of omeprazole (4 mg/kg) as a paste in a nonplacebo controlled cross over trial. Administration of the enteric coated formulation resulted in lower plasma omeprazole concentrations than those achieved with the higher dose of the paste formulation. 34 Rectal administration of omeprazole does not reliably decrease gastric pH. 35 Intra venous administration of omeprazole (0.5 mg/kg) significantly increases intragastric pH within 1 hour and appears to enhance healing of nonglandular ulcers. 36 The addition of trimethoprimsulfon amide to treatment with omeprazole does not enhance healing of ulcers of the glandu lar mucosa. 37 The composition of the excipients and form of omeprazole is important in deter mining efficacy. Forms of omeprazole other than that in the commercial preparation are associated with reduced or nil efficacy. Omeprazole is more effective than cimeti dine (20 mg/kg orally every 8 hours) for treatment of gastric ulcers in racehorses.",

The type of lesion is important, depending on whether the blood supply to a large section of intes tine is occluded or whether effective circula tion is maintained. Obstructions that do not cause widespread intestinal ischemia, such as those caused by focal external pressure or with some form of disease caused by pedun culated lipomas or caused by internal foreign bodies such as phytobezoars, are less acutely lethal and do not cause as severe signs as volvulus and forms of intussusception that result in ischemia of large sections of intes tine. In the latter case, endotoxins from the gut lumen pass through the devitalized tissues of the gut wall into the circulation, resulting in signs of toxemia and cardiovas cular collapse. There does not appear to be an important role for translocation of intes tinal bacteria into the bloodstream in horses with smallintestinal lesions. 14 ",

The pain can be minimally or only transiently responsive to administration of analgesics. During this early stage intestinal sounds are still present and feces still passed. The pulse rate increases to 60 to 80 beats/min, the respiratory rate can be as high as 80 beats/min, and sweating begins in many horses. It might be 8 to 12 hours before distended loops of intestine are palpable on rectal examination, and it is about the same time that clinical and labora tory evidence of hypovolemia is first appar ent. Depending on the site of the obstruction there can be reflux of fluid on passage of a nasogastric tube. More proximal lesions result in distension of the stomach earlier in the course of the disease. Smallintestinal dis tension is readily detected by percutaneous or rectal ultrasonographic examination. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonographic examination for detecting smallintestinal distension (98% and 84%, respectively) is greater than that of rectal examination (50% and 98%, respectively). 1, 15 In the period 12 to 24 hours after obstruc tion commences, the pulse rate rises to 80 to 100 beats/min, loops of distended intestine can be palpated per rectum, gut sounds and defecation cease, and the rectum is empty and sticky to the touch. Abdominal paracen tesis yields bloodstained fluid. From 24 hours onward, signs of hypovolemia and toxic shock become marked, but the pain may not worsen. The horse will often appear depressed and poorly responsive to external stimuli. Sweating may persist. The heart rate increases to 100 to 120 beats/min, intestinal loops are easily palpable, and reflux filling of the stomach occurs, with a great deal of fluid evacuated via the stomach tube; the horse may vomit. Death from endotoxemia or rupture of the intestine usually occurs within 48 hours. The terminal stage is one of severe endotoxic shock, with or without intestinal rupture and peracute diffuse peritonitis.",

However, approximately 40% of affected horses do not have signs of abdominal pain when examined at a referral center and 52% do not have nasogastric reflux. Horses with less severe clinical signs presumably have shorter lengths of incarcer ated small intestine or incomplete obstruc tions to passage of luminal material or blood flow. Herniation of the parietal (antimesen teric) margin of the small intestine is some times associated with incomplete obstruction of the small intestine and signs of mild dis ease. Because of the anterior location of the lesion, distended small intestine cannot usually be palpated per rectum and is not identifiable without ultrasonographic exami nation or surgical intervention. A fatal com plication of epiploic foraminal herniation is rupture of the portal vein, leading to sudden death from internal hemorrhage. Tension by the incarcerated section of gut on the portal vein causes tearing of the wall and subse quent hemorrhage.

Disruption of the smallintestinal mucosal barrier allows absorption of toxins, including endotoxins, which further compromise car diovascular and metabolic function. Death in untreated cases results from acute, diffuse peritonitis secondary to gastric rupture, or shock and metabolic disturbances secondary to hypovolemia and endotoxemia.

The differentiation of duodenitis proximal jejunitis and a smallintestinal obstructive lesion on clinical grounds is dif ficult, and there is no one variable that allows the distinction to be made reliably. Horses with duodenitisproximal jejunitis have a lower heart rate, higher rectal temperature (fever), lower volume of gastric reflux, and less turgid small intestine on rectal examina tion than do horses with obstructive lesions, although others report that horses with duo denitisproximal jejunitis have a higher volume of reflux at first examination and during the first 24 hours of disease. However, these differences are not sufficiently great to be conclusive. Horses with duodenitis proximal jejunitis more often have normal peritoneal fluid than do horses with small intestinal obstructive lesions. The response to gastric decompression and intravenous administration of fluids is useful in discrimi nating between diseases because horses with duodenitisproximal jejunitis have marked resolution of abdominal pain and tachycar dia within minutes of gastric decompression, whereas horses with smallintestinal obstruc tion have minimal or no resolution of these signs. Generally, horses with a heart rate below 60 beats/min after gastric decompres sion, mildly to moderately distended loops of small intestine, resolution of abdominal pain after gastric decompression, and normal peritoneal fluid probably have duodenitis proximal jejunitis. However, horses should be examined frequently for changes in clini cal condition.

The decision on whether to elect surgical treatment for affected horses is dependent on the availabil ity of surgical expertise and experience of clinicians in managing such cases medically or with surgical intervention. Horses for which surgical intervention is more likely are those with more severe signs of pain and absence of fever (each of which increases the likelihood of a smallintestinal obstructive lesion that requires surgical intervention for correction). 5 The duration of hospitalization is not different for horses treated medically (10 \u00b1 4 days) or surgically (10 \u00b1 6 days), although the survival rate for surgically treated horses is lower (75% versus 91%). 5 This could be a result of treatment modality, but it could also be related to the selection of horses for surgical treatment. Surgically treated horses are more likely to develop diarrhea (12% versus 28%). 5 Gastric decompression is an urgent need in affected horses and can be accomplished by nasogastric intubation. The nasogastric tube should be left in place, or replaced fre quently, for as long as there is reflux of clini cally significant quantities of fluid (more than 2-4 L/4 h in a 425kg horse). Discon tinuation of gastric siphonage should be approached cautiously and the horse moni tored for any increase in heart rate, develop ment of abdominal pain, or ultrasonographic evidence of gastric or smallintestinal disten sion that could indicate recurrence of gastric distension. After the nasogastric tube is removed, the horse should be reintroduced cautiously to oral fluids and food. Small amounts (1-2 L) of water should be offered frequently (every 1-2 hours) during the first 12 to 24 hours. Horses should not be given immediate access to ad libitum water because some horses in the early convalescent period from duodenitisproximal jejunitis will con sume a large quantity of water and develop gastric dilatation and colic. Feed should be reintroduced gradually over 24 to 48 hours.",

Cecal impaction is therefore probably much less common as a cause of colic in field cases. Cecal impaction is the most common cause of cecal disease (40%-50% of cases) and 5% of horses with intestinal impaction. 3, 7 There is no gender predisposition to the disease, although there are reports of a high proportion (22%) of affected mares having foaled within the previous 90 days or being pregnant (20%). 7 Older horses are dispropor tionately affected with 50% of affected horses being between 10 and 17 years of age. 7 Horses over 15 years are at increased risk compared with horses less than 7 years of age. 3 The disease occurs sporadically but is reported in horses and foals hospitalized or treated for an unrelated disease, and it is speculated that anesthesia, surgery, and/or administration of NSAIDs are risk factors for the disease. 3, 68 Hospitalization and treatment for ocular disease are risk factors for impaction colic, with 10 of 72 (14%) of such horses in one study developing impaction of the cecum. 9 Fasting, poor dentition, poorquality feed, and restricted water intake might also be risk factors for the disease. The case-fatality rate is approximately 30% to 50%. 7 A particular form of cecal impaction is that involving only the cecal base (cecal cupula) without accumulation of impacted material in the cecal apex or body of the cecum. 10 There are no identified risk factors, and the outcome of surgical treatment is good (100% survival of 7 horses treated). 10 The disease had a frequency of 0.45% of horses undergoing exploratory laparotomy. 10 Cecal Perforation or Rupture Cecal rupture at parturition occurs in 0.1% of mares. It represents approximately 27% of cecal disease in horses, and that associated with concurrent but apparently unrelated disease is the most common (13%). Cecal rupture or perforation is otherwise a spo radic disease that is often, but not always, a sequela to cecal impaction. The case-fatality rate is 100%. Cecal rupture, often without recognized preexisting disease, is a compli cation of anesthesia and NSAID (usually phenylbutazone) administration.

The displacement of the large colon (see Figs. 72 and 73) impedes aboral movement of ingesta and gas and may result in colonic distension. Should the dis tension become sufficiently severe, colon blood flow will be impaired and cause ische mia and necrosis of the colon. The obstruc tion to blood flow is predominantly in venous drainage, resulting in hemorrhagic strangulating obstruction with progressive development of intramural edema, extrava sation of red blood cells, microvascular thrombosis, mesothelial cell loss from the serosal surface, and mucosal necrosis with loss of colonic epithelium. Volvulus of the large colon of less than 270 degrees does not compromise blood supply but does impede aboral movement of ingesta and gas. Volvulus of 360 degrees or more causes ischemia through occlusion of both arterial and venous circulation of the involved large colon with rapid loss of colonic mucosal integrity and colon viability. There is reduced microvascular perfusion in horses with largecolon volvulus. 3 Irre versible mucosal damage occurs after 3 to 4 hours of ischemia. Loss of mucosal integrity impairs normal barrier function and permits toxins and substances normally confined to the colonic lumen to enter the systemic cir culation. Additionally, loss of barrier func tion allows leakage of vascular proteins and in severe cases red blood cells into the colonic lumen. Subsequent signs are typical of strangulating obstruction (see section Equine Colic) with development of toxemia, cardiovascular collapse, and death within 12 to 18 hours.",

The disease represented 13% of colic cases treated at a referral facility and approx imately 10% of colic cases seen in private practice in the UK. 1 An important risk factor is a change in management, especially one that involves a reduction in exercise and change in diet. 1 Risk factors for SCOD include cribbing or wind sucking, stabling with the risk increasing with the number of hours stabled per day, change in regular exer cise program, travel within the previous 24 hours, and lack of anthelmintic administra tion. A recent or current musculoskeletal injury is common in horses with SCOD. 1 Among 118 cases of SCOD examined in primary care practice in the UK, 53% resolved with minimal or no treatment, 37% required multiple visits or hospitalization, and 9% required surgical intervention or died. 1 The case-fatality rate is approxi mately 10%. 1 The disease is common in donkeys occur ring at a frequency of 3.2 per 100 donkeys per year and is the most common cause of colic in donkeys. 2,3 Important risk factors were increasing age (OR 1.1 per year), lower BW (0.98 per kg), previous colic (6.80), and presence of dental disease (29) . 2 The casefatality rate was 58%.",

Distension causes pain and changes in colonic motility that exacerbate or perpetu ate the impaction. Changes in motility can lead to displacement of the colon, such as right dorsal displacement.

Pain control is discussed in Table  715 . Fluid therapy is discussed in Chapter 5. Softening of ingesta is achieved by rehy drating the inspissated material and provid ing lubrication to hasten its passage. Fecal softeners (see Table 716 ) such as magne sium sulfate or sodium sulfate can be given to increase the fecal water content and soften the impacted, inspissated ingesta. Magne sium sulfate is associated with a small risk of hypermagnesemia and neurologic signs, whereas sodium sulfate causes a mild hyper natremia and hypokalemia. Oral adminis tration of a balanced, polyionic electrolyte solution is associated with the greatest increase in colonic water content and no change in serum electrolyte concentrations. Enteral administration of 10 L/h (to a 500kg horse) of a balanced, isotonic, polyionic elec trolyte solution is more effective than intra venous administration of the same quantity of water in combination with oral adminis tration of MgO 4 in hydrating colonic con tents in normal horses. Oral administration of plain water (100 mL/kg/day) is effective at increasing fecal water content in healthy a foreign body and which can cause disease evident as obstructive enterolithiasis. Most enteroliths in the colon of horses are of two major types: magnesium phosphates/struvite and magnesium vivianite. There is wide variability in macrotexture and ionic con centrations between and within enteroliths of ammonium magnesium phosphate (stru vite). Affected horses often have more than one enterolith and the enteroliths can weigh up to 12 kg.",

Equids that require surgical correction of sand colic and associated gastrointestinal abnormalities have a worse prognosis than do equids requiring solely medical treatment. 1 Medical treatment to effect sand removal is indicated in less acute cases.

However, in an experimental model of the disease this treatment was no more effective than no specific treatment in removal of sand from the cecum and colons. In contrast, administration of a combination of psyllium (0.5 kg orally twice daily) and mineral oil (2 L orally once daily) effectively removed 51% of the administered sand load, whereas treatment with mineral oil resulted in the passage of 26% of the sand. The largest amount of sand was excreted after 24 hours of treatment with psyllium and oil and after 5 days of treatment with oil only. 6 Mineral oil (1 mL/kg) or MgSO 4 (1 g/kg) orally may hasten sand removal.

There is almost always a history of administration of an NSAID. The disease can persist for weeks and often prompts inap propriate administration of NSAIDs. Rectal examination is unremarkable. Ultrasonography is useful in the diagnosis of right dorsal colitis by detecting the presence of a hypoechogenic submucosal layer and per mitting measurement of the wall thickness of the right dorsal colon. The hypoechogenic layer in the wall of the right dorsal colon cor responds with edema and cellular infiltrates observed histologically. The right dorsal colon in adult horses has a maximal thickness of 6 mm, whereas that in horses with right dorsal colitis is greater than 8 mm and can be as great as 16 mm. Additionally, the ratio of right dorsal colon to right ventral colon wall thickness is up to 1.6 in normal horses and greater than 2.0 in affected horses. Scintigraphic detection of right dorsal colitis is achieved by the administration of 99m tech netium hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime labeled white blood cells. Images obtained 20 hours after administration of labeled white cells demonstrated uptake of cells into the right dorsal colon (right cranioventral abdomen).",

This is best achieved by sedating the horse, providing local analgesia of the rectal mucosa and anus, and careful manual and visual examination of the rectal mucosa. Sedation can be achieved by administration of adrenergic agonists (xylazine, romifidine, and detomidine) with or without a narcotic drug (butorphanol, meperidine, pethidine, and morphine). Anal gesia of the rectum and anus can be induced by epidural anesthesia (lidocaine or xylazine) or local application of lidocaine gel or lido caine enema (10-15 mL of 2% lidocaine in 50-60 mL of water infused into the rectum). Peristalsis can be reduced by administration of hyoscine (Nbutylscopolammonium bromide, 0.3 mg/kg intravenously).",

Of over 1000 foals examined at studs in the UK the most common disease was diarrhea with systemic disease (fever, tachycardia, depression, dehydration, or combinations thereof) affecting 5.9% of foals <30 days of age. Approximately onehalf of these foals tested positive for rotavirus. 1 Etiologic infectious organisms were iso lated from 55% of 223 foals hospitalized in the United States for treatment of diarrhea, with 78% of the 122 positive foals having only one organism isolated. 3 Foals were tested for the presence of rotavirus, Salmonella spp., C. perfringens, C. difficile, coronavirus, hel minthes, and cryptosporidium.

There are five major types of C. perfringens and, while the organism is clearly associated with disease, a definitive role for each of these types in causing disease has not been established, partly because toxin pro duction for strains isolated from foals with diarrhea has not been routinely documented. However, there is clear evidence that C. perfringens type C causes diarrhea in foals. C. perfringens types A, B, D, and E might be associated with disease in foals, but definitive proof is lacking. \u03b22 toxigenic C. perfringens type A has been described as a cause of colitis in a foal. 4 C. difficile, alone or in coinfection with C. perfringens, is a cause of diarrhea in foals. 5, 6 E coli, an important cause of disease in neonates of other livestock species, does not appear to be an important cause of diarrhea in foals, although some strains are pathogenic. Similarly, although there are reports of coro navirus causing severe disease in foals, this does not appear to be a common cause of diarrhea in foals. Candida spp. can cause diar rhea in critically ill foals and those adminis tered antibiotics, but yeasts are apparently not causally associated with diarrhea in foals. 7 Yersinia spp. have been associated with diar rhea in foals but do not appear to be a common cause of disease. Bacteroides fragilis is an uncommon cause of diarrheal disease in foals. C. parvum or a specific horserelated cryptosporidium causes diarrheal disease in foals and can be isolated from broodmares. 810 The role of Campylobacter spp. in foal diar rhea, if there is any, is unclear, although it has been isolated from foals with enteritis. 11 Strongyloides westeri infection, although usually regarded as causing only mild disease, if any, can cause severe disease in a foals and an outbreak of diarrhea. 12 Group A rotaviruses are an important cause of diarrhea in foals and are discussed separately. 13, 14 Most foals develop transient, clinically unimportant mild diarrhea in the first 2 weeks of life. Colloquially referred to as foal heat diarrhea because of its temporal asso ciation with postpartum estrus in the dam, the occurrence of diarrhea is not associated with estrus in the dam but rather changes in intestinal flora as the foal ages. 15 Noninfectious causes of diarrhea in foals include foal heat diarrhea, overfeeding of orphan foals or feeding of incorrect milk replacers, primary or secondary lactose intolerance, and pica (allotriophagia), including eating of sand or dirt. Primary lactose intolerance, the congenital absence of lactase in foals, is reportedly rare. 16 Second ary lactase deficiency occurs in foals recover ing from enteritis and responds to feeding of lactosefree milk or administration of exog enous lactase. Acute pancreatitis causes diar rhea in foals, along with signs of abdominal pain and increases in lipase activity in blood and peritoneal fluid. 17 Diarrhea is common in foals with sys temic sepsis (septicemia) in which it can be attributable to the agent causing septicemia also causing colitis/enteritis (for example Salmonella spp.) or as a result of systemic organ dysfunction. 18 Approximately 50% of foals with diarrhea treated at a referral insti tution were bacteremic, although bacteremia was not associated with risk of death. 18",

Bicarbonate loss, per se, is not a cause of the metabolic acidosis, at least in calves. Infectious agents generally cause enteritis, although rotavirus infection is associated with loss of villous cells and subsequent loss of enzyme activity derived from the mature epithelial cell. The loss of enzyme activity, including that of disaccha ridases, causes malabsorption of nutrients in milk and other feed. Failure to absorb nutri ents in the small intestine causes them to be delivered to the cecum and large intestine where they are fermented. Subsequent reduc tions in colonic pH and increases in osmotic activity of the colon contents result in excre tion of large quantities of fluid and electro lytes. C. difficile and C. perfringens produce enterotoxins that cause damage to intestinal cells and accumulation of hemorrhagic fluid in the intestine. 16 L. intracellularis causes an infiltrative and proliferative enteropathy with subsequent protein loss and malabsorption of nutrients. 19 ",

The amount and frequency will depend on the size of the foal, severity of disease, and response to treatment. Foals that have clear signs of hypovolemia should be administered fluids intravenously.

Basic principles include ensuring adequate trans fer of passive immunity, reducing exposure to pathogens, and minimizing the effect of other risk factors. 23 Of the important causes of disease, in terms of morbidity and case-fatality rate, control of diarrhea associated with rotavirus and clostridial species is most important. Control of rotaviral diarrhea is discussed elsewhere. Control of clostridial diarrhea on farms with an endemic problems includes vaccinating of mares, administration of met ronidazole to atrisk foals, and supplemen tation of passive immunity with antitoxins to clostridial toxins. Vaccination of mares with toxoids (C. perfringens type C and D toxoid) prepared for use in other species has been practiced, but there are no reports of safety or efficacy. Administration of antitoxin raised against C. perfringens C, D, and E might provide protection against the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b5toxins that have the potential to affect foals. The antiserum, which is intended for use in ruminants, is administered orally (50-100 mL per foal) soon after birth. The efficacy of this practice has not been deter mined. Foals at risk may also be adminis tered metronidazole (10 mg/kg every 12 hours) for the first 4 to 5 days of life. Again, the efficacy of this practice has not been determined. Vaccination of mares with recombinant protein of C. difficile toxin resulted in production of specific antibodies, although the efficacy of the vaccine in pro tecting foals was not tested. 24 Administration of a probiotic containing Lactobacillus pentosus WE7 did not confer any protection against development of diar rhea in foals, and was associated with an increased risk of clinical disease, including diarrhea. In most cases (65%) of acute diarrhea in horses the cause is not determined, or if the cause is determined it is frequently at nec ropsy examination or as a result of serologic or microbiological testing after the horse has recovered.",

Diarrhea occurs in horses administered antimicrobials, but such horses frequently have other risk factors for development of diarrhea, and the link to antimicrobial administration is unclear. 1 The prevalence of antimicrobialinduced diarrhea in 5300 adult horses in three referral hospitals over 1 year was 0.6% and had an 18% case-fatality rate. 3 However, 6.3% of horses administered antimicrobials developed diarrhea within 7 days of arthroscopic surgery compared with none of 44 horses after arthroscopic surgery and not administered antimicrobials. 16 The macrolide antibiotic lincomycin causes acute, often fatal, disease of horses even when administered at relatively low doses, such as that resulting from horses ingesting medicated pig feed. Erythromcyin is associated with diarrhea in adult horses and in mares of foals administered the com bination of erythromycin and rifampin. Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of acute diarrhea but, when given intravenously at therapeutic doses (6.6 mg/kg every 12-24 hours) are probably no more likely to cause diarrhea than other broadspectrum antibiotics. Tetracy cline contamination of feed causes outbreaks of diarrhea on horse farms. Enrofloxacin can be a cause of diarrhea in horses. 3 The combination of trimethoprim and sulfadiazine given orally caused diarrhea in 7% of hospitalized horses, whereas pivampicillin, a prodrug of ampicillin, caused diarrhea in 3%, although this difference was not statistically significant. The risk of diarrhea was greatest in hospitalized horses administered enro floxacin or combinations of drugs including gentamicin. However, the number of horses with diarrhea was small and important asso ciations might have not been detected. 3",

Colitis is associated with increased production of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor, in the colon, and with impaired mucosal absorptive function. Additionally, bacterial toxins and inflammation result in an increase in mucosal permeability with loss of plasma proteins into the colonic lumen and systemic absorption of toxins, including endotoxin. Loss of plasma proteins causes a reduction in plasma colloidal oncotic pressure with subse quent extravasation of water and electrolytes and development of edema and decreased effective intravascular volume (hypovole mia). The effect of the decrease in oncotic pressure becomes most apparent in horses that are treated aggressively with fluids. These horses, which often inadvertently receive excessive amounts of sodium as part of their treatment, rapidly develop edema of the ventral body wall and colon, among other tissues.

The common form of the disease is one in which the infiltration is segmental and associated with acute colic caused by obstruction of the small intestine or large colon by mural lesions. 4, 5 The disease must be differentiated from other causes of colic.",

The presence of IgG anti bodies to BoNT/C in serum of 30.8% (61 of 198) of horses in Israel, where the disease is not recognized, suggests that factors other than simply exposure to BoNT/C are required for induction of the disease. 3 It is speculated that dietary factors (hence \"grass sickness\") alter gastrointestinal biota of horses and allow proliferation of C. botulinum type C or D, or promote increased production or absorption of neurotoxin, and initiate development of the disease. 4 Interestingly, horses with grass sickness have a higher prevalence of C. perfringens in feces (7/9 detected by culture and 15/37 by ELISA) and ileal contents than do horses with colic (1/16) of other cause or grazing healthy horses (0/60 by culture and 1/74 by ELISA). 5 indicating a causative role for C. perfringens in equine grass sickness. 5 Evidence supporting a role for C. botulinum toxins in the etiology of the disease included the isolation of toxin (BoNT/c) producing strains of C. botulinum type C from the ileum of 45% of horses with grass sickness and 4% of clinically normal control horses, the presence of higher concentrations of IgA antibodies to BoNT/C and BoNT/D in the ileum of horses with acute grass sick ness than of unaffected controls, 6 and higher risk of the disease in horses with low serum concentrations of antiBoNT/C IgG antibod ies. Vaccination of horses with a botulinum toxoid markedly reduced the mortality rate among vaccinated, compared with unvacci nated, horses providing evidence of a role for immunity to C. botulinum toxins in resis tance to the disease. 1 Remarkably, this study was conducted in 1922 and 1923. There are plans to conduct further vaccine trials. 7",

Under normal circumstances ammonia is absorbed and transported as ammonium in the blood to the liver, where it is converted to urea or incorporated into amino acids. A decrease in liver func tion or absorption from the gut of excessive amounts of ammonium can result in hyper ammonemia. Increases in blood ammonium concentration adversely affect neuron and astrocyte function leading to depolarization, activation of Nmethyldaspartate receptors and cell swelling. There is only a poor cor relation between blood ammonium concen trations and signs of neurologic disease, although systemic inflammation combined with hyperammonemia results in more severe signs than hyperammonemia alone. 1 The epidemiology of the syndrome is not well described. The disease is reported in the UK and the eastern and southeastern United States. Equids of any age can be affected including foals less than 1 day of age. 4 Risk factors include gastrointestinal disease (colitis, enterocolitis, colic, and meconium impaction). 4 Case-fatality rate in equids treated at a referral hospital was 60% (22 of 36 cases). Ingestion of black locust roots (Robinia pseudoacacia) caused the disease in two ponies. 7 Infection with C. sordellii is a suspected cause in adult horses. 8 The clinical signs include those of colitis, enterocolitis, or colic and can include diar rhea and depressed mentation. Horses are usually tachycardic and tachypneic but not usually pyrexic. Signs of neurologic dysfunc tion can be present at the initial examination, with signs of gastrointestinal disease, or can develop over the next 24 to 72 hours. Signs of neurologic disease include profound depression, head pressing, ataxia, central blindness, recumbency, personality changes, aggression, abnormal mentation, compulsive walking, circling, lip smacking, and seizures (petite mal or grand mal). 4 Hyperammonemia (normal is less than ~55 \u00b5mol/L) is present and an essential com ponent of the diagnosis. Blood ammonium concentrations are usually over 100 \u00b5mol/L and can exceed 1000 \u00b5mol/L, although horses with severe systemic inflammation can have signs of neurologic disease with blood ammo nium concentrations as low as 60 \u00b5mol/L. 4 Affected horses have hematological signs consistent with inflammation (leukocytosis), hypovolemia (increased hematocrit, and serum total protein concentration), and some have mild increases in serum activity of liver derived enzymes (GGT). 4 Treatment is largely supportive, including correction of hypovolemia, protection from selfharm, control of seizures, efforts to reduce blood ammonium concentration, and reduction of systemic inflammation. The underlying disease should be treated as appropriate. Reduction of blood ammonium concentration can involve the administra tion of oral neomycin, lactulose, or both. The efficacy of these treatments has not been determined. Lactulose (~300 mg/kg orally every 8 hours) is used, but the decrement in blood ammonium concentration in affected horses is undetermined and in healthy horses is modest (3 \u00b5mol/L). 4 Lactulose is proposed to act by acidifying the colon contents, favor ing conversion of the freely absorbable ammonia (NH 3 ) to ammonium. Activated charcoal or mineral oil can be given to reduce absorption and increase excretion of ingested toxic materials. 7 Sedatives might need to be administered to control abnormal ambulation or behavior.

Ulcers usually ini tially occur along the junction of the PE with the glandular stomach but may enlarge to efface the entire squamous portion of the stomach. These more diffuse ulcers are easily missed on cursory examination because of their uniform appearance. Chronic gastric ulcers develop thickened, raised edges caused by ongoing fibrosis, occasionally resulting in a gastroesophageal stricture. The histologic appearance varies with the stage of lesion development, but in fatalities there is typi cally complete loss of the epithelial layer, with exudation of neutrophils from a bed of mature granulation tissue. In one survey of apparently normal stomachs it was found that 32% had histologic parakeratosis, 38% had mild erosions, and 23% had severe ulcer ations.

The temperature is subnormal, the respira tion is distressed, and there is a bluish discol oration of the skin. Death occurs in 24 to 36 hours. Acute cases occur in young pigs up to 3 months of age, and chronic cases, caused by ulceration and chronic peritonitis, occur in the 7 to 8month age group.",

Regardless of the route of infection, SCS can persist in the tonsil and ileocolic lymph nodes, ileocolic junction and colon, and can be excreted in the feces of experimentally infected pigs for at least 12 weeks. The amount of shedding and persistence of infec tion is dose dependent. Low doses of SCS can be easily cleared, moderate doses can persist for at least 2 months, and high doses result in longterm carrier states. After intranasal inoculation of STM the organism rapidly appears in the intestines, suggesting that the tonsils and lungs may be important sites for invasion and dissemination of Salmonella species. Experimental infection with a zoo notic strain of S. Newport can also be estab lished in pigs at 7 weeks of age to persist until market age (28 weeks). Longterm persis tence of infection is limited generally to the palatine tonsils, the intestinal tract caudal to the midjejunum, and their lymph nodes. The prevalence of the organism in pigs creates a reservoir of infection for animals and humans. The transmission of salmonellosis in pigs can occur in a few days. Exposure to relatively low levels of SCS may result in high morbidity and initiate a severe out break in naive pigs within several days of being exposed to infected pigs. Only a small fraction of carrier pigs are responsible for the maintenance of the pathogen in a pig popu lation. SCS may persist for at least 3 months in wet feces and 6 months in dried feces.",

The morbidity and mortality rates were high and the disease spread rapidly through commercial pigfin ishing units. These outbreaks are now rare and small in scope, largely because of the restric tion of garbage feeding, much less movement and mixing of pigs through public auction marts, and diseaseprevention strategies such as the use of specific pathogenfree (SPF) pigs, an allin/allout policy in commercial finishing units, and the vertical integration of pigproducing enterprises. This ensures a constant supply of diseasefree growing hogs to finishing units and the assumption of a pyramidtype responsibility at all levels of the enterprise.

However, modern methods of raising pigs in multisite production systems, using allin/allout management of finishing pigs, appear to have no benefit in reducing the prevalence of Salmonella compared with conventional farrow-finish systems.",

Comprehensive longi tudinal studies of two multisite pig produc tion systems in the United States revealed considerable temporal variability in Salmonella prevalence between cohorts of pigs. Cohorts of sows and individually identified growing pigs from their litters were serially sampled to determine the prevalence and serotypes of salmonellas in each stage of production based on fecal culture and feed and environmental samples. A total of 15 different serotypes were isolated from the two systems. Pig prevalence estimates ranged from 0 to 48.1%. Environmental contamina tion was frequently encountered despite cleaning and disinfection. Feed was only rarely contaminated. The prevalence of infection within and among cohorts of pigs was highly variable, which indicates that point estimates of Salmonella prevalence and serotypes are not reliable indicators of the Salmonella status on farms, and that uncon trolled studies of interventions to control Salmonella on pig farms may yield mislead ing results.",

Salmonella was predom inant in weaners, growers, and finishers, and was only occasionally detected in sows and gilts. This is contrary to the results of studies in the United States, in which Salmonella was found to be common in sows. In the Danish study, there was a rapid increase in Salmonella prevalence in the nursery, which may be associated with the stressors of weaning such as change in feed, commingling of litters, and piglets being deprived of the antibodies in sow's milk before activation of their own immune response. The observa tion that no piglets were shedding Salmonella just before weaning, but 3 to 4 weeks later in the nursery between 5% and 50% of the piglets were shedding, suggests that horizontal transmission occurred in the nursery. During the finishing period Salmonella shedding decreased, but with consider able variation. Some pigs cleared themselves of the infection, whereas others continued shedding. Average shedding time was esti mated to be 18 to 26 days. Seroprevalence peaked approximately 60 days after peak prevalence in culture. At slaughter there is a marked increase in the prevalence of Salmonella infection. This increase may be caused by rapid crosscontamination during trans port and lairage. Rapid infection during transport, and particularly during holding, is a major reason for increased Salmonella prevalence in pigs. A high degree of carcass contamination occurs at slaughter from the delivery of Salmonellapositive pigs and crosscontamination from the slaughter house environment. Contaminated feed trucks also may serve as a potential source of Salmonella contamination. The withdrawal of feed from pigs before slaughter does not increase the prevalence of Salmonella coloni zation or the risk of carcass contamination. Over time in a swine production unit it was found that a particular genotype of Salmonella, if introduced into a breedinggestation unit of a farm, would evolve only slowly over short time intervals; its spatial distribution would be limited primarily to adjacent or nearby pens. 35 Risk factors associated with serologic Salmonella prevalence in finishing pig herds in the Netherlands have been examined. Feeding a complete liquid feed containing fermented byproducts and the omission of disinfection after pressure washing a compartment as part of an allin/allout procedure were both asso ciated with a lower Salmonella seropreva lence. A small to moderate herd size (<800 finishing pigs), a previous diagnosis of clini cal Salmonella infection in the herd, the use of tylosin as an antimicrobial growth promoter in finishing feed, and herds that have more than 16% of their pigs' livers condemned at slaughter because of white spots were associ ated with a higher Salmonella seroprevalence. There was no effect on experimental Salmonella infection of the use of tylosin as an antimicrobial growth promoter.",

In lethal infections, the early growth of the bacterins the tissues results in high bacterial numbers that lead to death of the animal. Following natural infection with Salmonella antibody, responses to lipopolysac charides (LPS) and protein determinants can be detected. AntiSalmonella IgM appears in serum early after infection followed by IgG. Tcells have a critical role in the later stages of primary infection. The presence of STM in mesenteric lymph nodes was examined, and it was found that there was an immune response marked by a substantial infiltration of phagocytes and an upregulation of proin flammatory genes. This resulted in a reduc tion of STM but not the total elimination. It might be that STM interferes with dendritic cell-Tcell interactions. 38, 39 Environmental and Management Risk Factors Farming Practice in General There are a wide variety of contributing factors to Salmonella infections.

Since 1990 there have been dramatic increases in the occurrence of multiresistant strains of Salmonella spp. in many developed coun tries. Of particular note has been the epi demic spread of STM DT104, which now has a worldwide distribution. AMR in zoonoti cally transmitted salmonellas is an undesir able but almost inevitable consequence of the use of antimicrobials in food animals. Generally, such use is legitimate. Recom mendations have been made that new anti microbials with crossresistance to those used in human medicine should not be used for prophylaxis in foodanimal production. For example, it is argued that the use of antimicrobials in food animals has been a major factor in the development of decreased susceptibility to antibiotics such as cipro floxacin in zoonotically transmitted salmo nellas. Multidrug resistant strains that also carry specific virulence factors are more likely to be of clinical significance. 47 AMR of Salmonella has been a major con troversial concern in veterinary medicine and human public health. Antimicrobials are used in foodproducing animals for the treat ment of infectious diseases and for growth promoting effects. Their continued use has long been incriminated as a major cause of selective pressure that leads to the appear ance and persistence of resistant strains. The resistance is usually to multiple antimicrobi als and its existence is considered as a poten tial risk factor. The significance of AMR is most obvious in its impact on the treatment of human infections. If the frequency of drug resistance increases, the choice of antimicro bials for the treatment of systemic salmonel losis in humans becomes more limited. There is also an association between drugresistant salmonellas and the routine clinical use of antimicrobials for infections other than salmonellosis. The AMR Salmonella infec tions can complicate antimicrobial therapy of other infections; prior antimicrobial therapy allows fewer numbers of AMR Salmonella to cause symptomatic infections, and an increase in the proportion of Salmonella species that are AMR will increase the overall frequency of salmonellosis.",

In the UK, over a period of about 20 years, little change has occurred in the AMR patterns of salmonellas isolated from animals. Most of the resistance in STM is associated with phagetype DT204C. Serotypes other than SD and STM show low levels of resistance to most antimicrobials, with the exception of sulfonamides and tetracyclines, to which resistance is increasing.",

The nature of the disease that occurs follow ing infection is dependent on the specific combination of serovar and host known as serovar-host specificity. A range of infections is included in the term salmonellosis. The most common type of infection is known as \"the carrier state, \" in which car riage of the organism is not accompanied by clinical abnormalities or clinical disease. In production animals, these carriers are of importance because they may serve as reser voirs for further spread of infection through shedding and may be present as contami nated food products.",

Many animals survive this stage of the disease, but localiza tion of the salmonellas occurs in mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and particularly the gallbladder. In experimental STM infec tion in pigs, the organism can persist from 6 to 8 weeks of age until market age with long term persistence in the palatine tonsils, gastrointestinal tract, and adjacent lymph nodes.

In either instance the animals become chronic carriers and discharge sal monellas intermittently from the gallbladder and foci of infection in the intestinal wall into the feces and occasionally into the milk. For this reason they are important sources of infection for other animals and for humans. Carrier animals may also develop an acute septicemia or enteritis if their resistance is lowered by environmental stresses or inter current infection.

The best information available on the pathogenesis of enteritis is derived from the experimentally produced disease. In most instances the disease is produced by the administration of massive doses of bacteria, and this may result in the production of a different syndrome from that which occurs naturally. The pathogenesis of enteric salmo nellosis is much more complex than cholera, involving an increase in mucosal cell cyclic AMP content and prostaglandin concentra tion, as well as an inflammatory response to the invading bacteria. Intestinal inva sion is a characteristic feature of Salmonella pathogenesis. The organism must invade the intestinal mucosal epithelium to cause disease. Neutrophil recruitment and trans migration across the epithelium is important in the enteritis. Hostderived caspase1 can act as a proinflammatory agent by cleav ing IL1\u03b2 and IL18 into active molecules. SipA is a protein that Salmonella injects into the host cells, which has also been shown to contribute to the inflammatory response by activation of phosphokinase C. This acti vates the transepithelial migration of neu trophils into the intestinal lumen. Diarrhea is a result of decreased sodium absorption and increased chloride secretion caused by choleralike and Shigalike enterotox ins. Certain Salmonella outer membrane proteins also mediate cell damage. Sur vival within the phagocyte (O side chains, smooth LPS, and an LPS core are important) is also an important attribute of virulent salmonellas.",

The organisms proliferate in the intestine, invade the intestinal epithelium, stimulate fluid secretion, and disseminate from the intestine to mesenteric lymph nodes and other organs. SCS invades enterocytes by penetration of the brush border, resulting in focal loss of microvilli, and the bacteria are endocytosed into membranebound vacu oles. Experimental infection of ileal-gut loops of pigs with S. enterica results in prefer ential bacterial adherence to Mcells within 5 minutes, and by 10 minutes, bacterial inva sion of the apical membrane occurs in Mcells, goblet cells, and enterocytes.

To be able to estimate the number of infected animals entering the abattoir and estimate the size of the Salmonella problem in pig herds, the population and herd level preva lence of Salmonella have to be investigated. An estimation of the prevalence of S. enterica infection in finishing pigs in Iowa was done using onfarm fecal cultures, culture of onfarm necropsy and abattoircollected samples, and serum ELISA using serum exudate (meat juice). Fecal samples collected on the farm detected only 13.3% of all posi tive pigs necropsied on the farm. Abattoir and onfarm results combined, the fecal sample detected 57.4% of positive pigs. Abat toircollected samples provided prevalence estimates much higher than onfarm col lected samples (39.9% versus 5.3%). Thus fecal samples have a low sensitivity for detecting infected pigs, and abattoircol lected samples overestimate the onfarm S. enterica prevalence. A study of subiliac lymph nodes at slaughter showed that they had a low rate of detection compared with the onfarm incidence. 79 Pigs can become infected during routine testing or holding periods during marketing when exposed to relatively low numbers of Salmonella in the preslaughter environment.

It is accepted that this can occur and that the use of antimicrobials can theoretically contribute to the spread of disease. However, because of the way in which animals are kept, and because they constantly ingest contaminated pasture or other feed, there is an almost universal carrier segment in animal populations, and to regard another survivor from salmonel losis as a significant contributor to the carrier frequency seems an exaggeration. In many situations this appears to be the correct view, but in other situations an animal can become infected, for example, in a veterinary hospital or at an exhibition or show, recover clinically with treatment and, after returning to its parent herd, initiate an outbreak of fatal and debilitating salmonellosis. Both epidemio logic patterns occur, and they seem to occur in different places, so that the most appropri ate attitude to take seems to be the one that fits local circumstances. In an area in which only sporadic cases of the disease occur in herds, it would be professionally negligent not to treat infected animals with appropri ate antimicrobials.

Finishers receiving growers that were positive had a much higher level of seroprevalence in the finishers than those that did not. \u2022 If possible, purchase animals when they are older to provide an opportunity for specific and nonspecific immunity to develop. Animals from vaccinated herds are desirable but not always available. \u2022 The premises of dealers, saleyards, and transport vehicles must be under close surveillance, and the need for frequent vigorous disinfection must be stressed. With decreasing levels of infection it is important that the infections in transport systems and the lairage are managed. 84 Introduce only those animals likely not to be carriers. Unfortunately the detection of carriers is inaccurate and expensive. To have any confidence in the results, fecal samples for culture must be submitted on at least three occasions. Even then, occasional carriers with lesions in the gallbladder or tonsils will escape the net and be capable of reviving the disease on the farm or transferring it to another one. Rodent and bird control is essential. Control of access to potential human fomites is also important, and they should be provided with clean protective clothing and boots before entering the herd. The significance of various environmental sources is often neglected and should be studied more intensely, such as lairages and truckwashing facilities. 85",

As a result of the program the level of Salmonella in Danish pork declined from 3.5% in 1993 to 0.7% in 2000. Simultaneously, the number of human cases of salmonellosis caused by pork declined from approximately 1444 in 1993 to 166 in 2000. Quality control has been described. 113 The control program is integrated from \"feed to food. \" It is based on routine testing and classification of slaughter pig herds and the subsequent slaughter of pigs according to the inherent risk, as measured by the con tinual test program. In a study of culture and ELISA testing, it was found that results cannot be compared easily, because some seronegative pigs were + ve on culture and some culture \u2212 ve pigs were + ve on serology, so the test has to be selected to answer a specific question. 114 Methodological prob lems related to the optical density data obtained from meat juice ELISAs have been shown to require recalculation; otherwise there would be an underestimation of actual seroprevalence. 115 The Danish Control system and a descrip tion of an extended preharvest surveillance and control program has been described. 116 Only hotwater decontamination was socio economically profitable in a comparison with the control plan as it operated in 2006. 117 Basically, the level of Salmonella is con trolled at various stages. The UK plan has been described. 118 The barriers to the adop tion of measures to control Salmonella in pigs in the UK has been reviewed 119 and one of the most important measures was the failure of farmers to recognize the impor tance of Salmonella control. Other factors are the low awareness of pork as a risk for Salmonella, the low incidence of Salmonella associated with pork, and the food chain members do not want to raise the problems. It is important to recognize that pooled sam pling is highly efficient compared with indi vidual sampling and that clustering at pen level influences the results; thus it is impor tant to take this into account in the estima tion of appropriate sample sizes and the estimation of prevalence from pooled sample data. 120 These data can be used to study spatial disease epidemiology. 121 Feedstuffs Compounded feeds are heat treated at 81\u00b0C to eliminate Salmonella. The national program requires mandatory Salmonella testing in all plants producing animal feeds. In 2000 the level of Salmonella spp. in final products was only 0.3%.",

CD is an important cause of diarrhea in humans associated with antibiotic usage. It may also present as a colitis, or fulminant colitis followed by ileus, toxic megacolon, and bowel perforation. It may also cause diarrhea in antibiotic treated foals, hamsters, and guinea pigs. Some authors highlight the high level of relatedness of CD ribotypes found in human and porcine isolates. 1,2 It was originally associated with hospital infec tions but now approximately 40% may be communityassociated CD infections. 3, 4 The ribotype O78 is an emerging strain in humans and pigs. 5 There is still confusion as to whether this is a potential zoonotic or foodborne disease. 6 It is likely that there is little foodborne risk because the level of infection in slaughter pigs is greatly reduced. 7 It has been suggested that humans and pigs may be exposed to the same environmental sources of CD. The comparative pathology of CDassociated disease has been described. 8 It may be the most important uncontrolled cause of neonatal diarrhea in the pig. 9 ETIOLOGY CPC is a primary pathogen but can colonize other lesions. It is a large, grampositive rod that only occasionally forms spores and pro duces the \u03b1 and \u03b2toxins (CPA and CPB toxins).

It causes fluid production in the intestine. Toxin B ((TcdB; 270kDa) does not appear to bind to any tissue nor does it produce lesions in explants, 34 but it appears to be a cytotoxin that is extremely toxic to cultured cells. Both toxins are internalized by target cells and disrupt the cytoskeleton. There is cessation of enzyme production and cell division. Degranulation of mucosal mast cells and release of inflammatory mediators follows with resultant tissue damage. The key event appears to be the receptormediated endocy tosis in intestinal epithelial cells. 35 A poreforming toxin has been identi fied in necrotic enteritis strains of C. perfringens. 36 A large survey of AMR and toxin genes in commercial swine was undertaken. 37 In young pigs, sampled at farrowing time, 73% had CD, and it was isolated from 47% of sows.

The profile ciprofloxacin-erythromycintetracycline was detected in 21.4% of the piglets and 11.75 of the sows. Most had TcdA (65%), TcdB was found in 84%, and the binary toxin CdtB was found in 77%. The presence of CD spores in the feces of foodproducing animals represents a risk for contamination of meat products. 38 In colon explants, toxin A produces cell swell ing, swelling of mitochondria and other organelles, distension of cytoplasmic vesi cles, expansion of paracellular spaces, apop tosis, and necrosis. 35 C. perfringens type E rarely causes damage in the pig gut but it can in weaned pigs and does so when maternal antibodies have disappeared.",

PWD is a significant cause of mortality between weaning and slaughter in some herds. Although the clini cal signs in these two diseases are different, they occur in similar age groups, and the same type of management change may precede their occurrence. Weaning and weaning age are both associated with signifi cant effects on the microbial populations. In PWD the bacteria disappear more quickly, usually by about 7 days postinfection (DPI), but in ED they may still be there 9 DPI but with a slower buildup to a peak within 3 to 5 DPI. A typical scenario would be 4 to 5 days PWD followed by clinical ED with mor tality reaching as high as 50%. Both are asso ciated with the proliferation of predominantly hemolytic serotypes of E. coli within the small intestine. However, it is rare to encoun ter both diseases concurrently on the same farm. In PWD the serotypes are ETEC and the major manifestation is diarrhea resulting from enterotoxin activity at the time of pro liferation.

Three serogroups cause ED: O138, O139, and O141 and sometimes O147. They are called EDEC and are nearly all \u03b1hemolytic. The strains have adhesins that enable the bacteria to colonize the intestine and elaborate protein exotoxins. The biochemical phenotypes were studied in Sweden and O138, O139, and O141 are dominated by one phenotypic type, even though others do occur within the serotype. The entire pathogenicity island known as ETT2 is necessary for the ED viru lence factors in O138, O139, or O141. Iso lates of E. coli have been found in which the toxin or F18 fimbrial types were not related to selected electrophoretic types. This sug gests that toxin and F18 genes in the isolates from pigs with PWD or ED occur in a variety of chromosomal backgrounds. The bacteria colonize the small intestine without causing significant changes by means of the adher ence factor F18 (F107), usually F18ab or occasionally F18ac, as the fimbrial adhesin. The E. coli strains with the highest mucin binding capacity belonged to potential ST toxin producers, whereas strains without genes encoding for toxin production dis played a much weaker binding to mucin capacity. In a recent outbreak in Denmark, in which ED had not previously been observed, most isolates were O139, but a few were untypeable. All the isolates from the Danish pigs with ED were in one cluster in contrast to isolates from other countries, which did not form any clusters. In the Denmark study, 563 isolates were serotyped and O149 was found in 49.9% of the isolates, O138 in 14.9%, O139 in 6.9%, O141 in 4.1%, and O8 in 3.7%.

Characteristically, the larger and faster growing pigs within the group are affected. The disease is not common in runt or poorly thriving pigs.

The experi mental oral inoculation of the EDproducing E. coli results in colonization of the small intestine, and lesions of the vessels of the intestinal mucosa are detectable as early as 2 days after infection. An experimental model for subclinical ED in weaned pigs has been described. Microscopic vascular lesions were found in pigs 14 days after oral inoculation with a SLT2positive strain of E. coli . Once PWD occurs there is an increased intestinal permeability that predisposes to ED, and once developed the influx of SLT toxin into the bloodstream is facilitated further, pre cipitating the disease.

It is a major cause of economic loss from both mortality and inferior growth rates for several days to 2 weeks following weaning. The etiology, epi demiology, and pathogenesis are multifacto rial and complex because of the several weaningassociated factors that may interact. In some instances the PWD may be followed by ED. The presence of the F4 receptor was asso ciated strongly with pigs being high shedders of E. coli. 4 Most commonly, F4 is serotype O149, and F18 is serotype O 139, O138, O141, O149, and O157, which are associated with the disease. Most serotypes appear to be O149:STaSTbLT:F4 (K88). The strains of O149 isolated in recent years from weaned pigs with diarrhea possess the gene for an additional enterotoxin STa, which older strains lack. Of the new strains that corre spond to O149 H10, 92% code for this gene. This enteroaggregative E. coli heatstable enterotoxin 1 (EAST 1) gene is found in iso lates from weaned pigs that have diarrhea or ED. The F107 fimbriae can be found in asso ciation with PWD isolates, and other adhe sive fimbriae such as Av24 and 2134P have been described. Many ETEC isolates colo nize the small intestine of weaned pigs but lack known colonization factors. The sero groups of E. coli isolated from pigs with PWD in piggeries in Spain include strains that produce the ETEC and VTEC E. coli and cytotoxic necrotizing factor toxins. The disease can be reproduced consistently in weaned pigs, provided the pig's epithelial cell brush borders are susceptible to the adhesin of strains of E. coli with fimbrial antigen F4 (K88). The DNA sequences coding for the F18 fimbrial antigens and AIDA adhesin are on the same plasmid in E. coli isolated from the cecum.

The virulence factors for PWD are associated with the F4 and F18 fimbrial antigens that carry the genes for the production of toxins (STa, STb, LT, SLT2a, and SLX2e). The receptor for the F4 adhesin is not found in all pigs. There are five phenotypes based on the susceptibility of brush borders of different pigs to adherence of isolates producing variants F14ab (K88ab), F4ac (K88ac), and F4ad (K88ad). Pigs with at least one copy of the dominant allele for the receptor are susceptible to epithelial cell adherence and therefore colonization. The F18ab variant is expressed by the E. coli O139 strain producing Shigalike toxin and causing ED. The F18ac fimbrial E. coli strains often relating to O141 or O157 cause diarrhea by expressing enterotoxins (STa or STb) either together or with or without Shigalike toxins. STb binds to a particular receptor. 6 The PWD strains also produce LT, which lead to hypersecretion of electrolytes and water. 7, 8 Following weaning, their numbers in feces normally increase markedly, even in pigs that remain healthy. The E. coli proliferate in the small intestine and produce an enterotoxin that appears to attach to the receptors. This triggers the uptake of calcium into the cell, which results in the excretion of water and electrolytes into the lumen. This causes a net loss of fluid and electrolytes to the lumen and subsequent diarrhea. After weaning, the net absorption of fluid and electrolytes in the small intestine of pigs is temporarily decreased.",

The susceptibility of the small intestine to the enterotoxin varies according to area; the upper small intestine is highly susceptible, and susceptibility decreases down through the more distal portions. Unlike many other species, the weanling pig depends largely on its large intestine for absorption of fluid and electrolytes with only small changes in net fluid movement occurring along the jejunal and ileal segments. In fatal cases, death results from the combined effects of dehydra tion and acidosis resulting from fluid and electrolyte losses.

The finishing pigs showed the lowest levels of AMR. Onfarm AMR did not select for the VGs in E. coli carried by a population of healthy pigs. 14 In a study of pigs fed antibiotics it was shown that bacterial biotypes shifted after 14 days of treatment, with the medicated pigs showing an increase in Proteobacteria (1%-11%) compared with the nonmedicated pigs. Antibiotic resistance genes increased in diar rhea and diversity. Some of the new genes conferred resistance to antibiotics that had not been given. 15 The E. coli stored in a storage tank was more diverse than that in fresh feces. The detection of resistance to specific antibiotics was not significantly different. 16 There may a horizontal exchange of AMR genes. Almost half (47%) of E. coli and Salmonella isolated from the same fecal samples showed the AMR genes at the same level. 17, 18 Significant spacetime clusters of resistant E. coli were found in parts of Denmark. 19 In a study of E. coli isolated from pigs in China it was found that most isolates were geneti cally unrelated. AMR was found in 89% of E. coli strains. Most prevalent VG was East 1, followed by Stx2e and eae. The authors stressed that there was a great need to monitor changes as a result of the high inci dence of VG and AMR. 20 The pharmacody namics of antimicrobials at different levels of the intestinal tract of pigs and their relation ship to E. coli resistance patterns in the pig have been described. 21 A study of AMR and virulence profile genes in multidrugresistant ETEC isolated from pigs with PWD in Aus tralia 22 has shown that nine serogroups were identified, particularly O149. None showed resistance to ceftiofur or enrofloxacin, and 9.4% were resistant to florfenicol. O141 had a higher AMR index than other serogroups. There were few associations between AMR and VGs.

To avoid a sudden transi tion in diet at weaning, creep feed should be introduced to the suckling piglets by at least 10 days of age. It is important that the creep feed and feeder area be kept fresh to main tain palatability. The same feed should be fed for at least 2 weeks following weaning, and all subsequent feed changes should be made gradually over a 3 to 5day period.

In a study 26 of the role of fiber in the control of PWD it was found that there were two major means of reducing enteric disorders: (1) by minimizing the use of nonstarch poly saccharides (NSPs) such as pearl barley and guar gum, which lead to increased digesta viscosity and (2) by including moderate levels of NSPs that do not increase digesta viscosity, such as oats and inulin, especially where there are levels of high crude protein. NSP fractions affect the taxonomic composi tion and metabolic features of the fecal microbiota. 27 The use of lowprotein diets may reduce the toxic products and reduce PWD. A diet with decreased protein content reduces protein fermentation and the incidence of PWD challenged with ETEC. 28 The develop ment of greater digestibility or stimulation of higher feed intake may also be responsible for reduction of PWD. 29 Zinc oxide in the diets at 300 to 4000 ppm may stop PWD by preventing colonization of the epithelial lining of the intestine. A variety of feedstuffs reduced the adhesion of ETEC to a porcine intestinal cell line and reduced the inflam matory response. 30 A symbiotic preparation of starch and antiETEC K88 probiotic in the presence of raw potato starch is an effective method for reducing the negative effects of ETEC in the piglet model. 31 Organic acid administration in drinking water to reduce the pH to 4.0 has shown that there was a reduction in the excretion of fecal E. coli, but there was also a significantly decreased water intake. 32 \u03b2Glucans also reduce susceptibility to ETEC, 33 and in this study there was a reduced excretion of F4 + E. coli and a reduced F4specific serum antibody response.",

A gene has been discovered that encodes for a surface antigen (LsaA) that is believed to be associated with attachment to and entry into cells and that is synthesized during infections. A study of recorded out breaks of PHE indicated the disease often occurred within 12 months after repopula tion of the herd and following withdrawal of antimicrobials from the feed. It has been pro posed that the introduction of breeding stock from herds in which the disease is endemic may be a risk factor, but this is not documented. In a study in the UK showed there seemed to be a higher risk when there were more than 500 sows. An older parity structure in the sow population seemed to reduce infection. There seemed to be a higher risk if buying in boars. Fully slatted or fully meshed floors also carried a higher risk of infection compared with solid floors or straw. A higher risk was seen in those herds in which large numbers of pigs entered the finishing units simultaneously. Pigs on concrete slats may also be predis posed. Intensive systems were more severely affected than outdoor systems. There was a reduced risk if there was thorough cleaning and disinfection (allin/allout) before the next group of pigs arrived. Seroconversion usually occurred as the pigs entered the fin ishing site suggesting that the exposure takes place in the nursery. There may be five major types of risk factor: comingling, temperature fluctuations (overheating/ chilling), trans portation, depopulation, and new buildings. Sows may have low levels of antibody and are capable of passing on colostral protection to the piglets. Maternal antibodies have usually declined by 3 to 5 weeks of age but may be extended to 42 days by repeated sow vaccina tion, by which time exposure may have occurred and there may be both active and passive antibodies.",

They have shown that the sys tem is operative in LI. 9 The infection is by oral means and enters the epithelial cells of the crypts of the small intestine. The process appears to go ileum first then colon, to cecum, and finally rectum. 4 The infection process appears to take about 3 weeks to peak with the organ isms appearing in the feces about 1 week after experimental infection. The histologic lesions may have cleared from the ileum by day 29 following inoculation. Considerable progress has been made using porcine ileal models. 12 Proliferative enteropathy is character ized by the hyperplasia of the epithelial cells of the intestinal crypts, particularly in the ileum and colon. The presence of non membrane bound, curved bacteria free in the cytoplasm of the affected enterocytes is a consistent feature of the disease. The bacteria associate with the enterocyte and enter through an entry vacuole, which then breaks down and the LI live freely in the cell. The organisms infect the immature cells of the mucosal glands and stop them from maturing. 13 The goblet cells decrease and then disappear. The cells lose protein and fail to absorb nutrients, which then contrib utes to the weight loss that occurs. 14 This causes them to multiply without leaving the gland, and the cells then degenerate prob ably by apoptosis and the glands continue to proliferate. 15 Gross and microscopic lesions typical of acute proliferative enteritis can be repro duced by inoculation of cellcultured LI into pigs 3 or 7 weeks of age. The incubation period is about 7 to 14 days with the early lesions appearing in the terminal ileum. Fecal shedding usually occurs about 7 days postchallenge and the animals seroconvert about 14 days postchallenge. The disease peak is about 21 days postinfection. The clinical signs decrease, and the lesions begin to resolve after 28 days. The disease process results in a 2week delay in marketing. Inoc ulation of gnotobiotic pigs does not cause the disease. It now seems certain that LI is the causative agent of the disease complex. Infec tion of intestinal epithelial cells is causally linked to marked hyperplastic proliferation of affected tissue.",

At day 14 postinfection there were a few pinpoint lesions, and the percentage of infected crypts was minimal. At the same time the number of CD3+ cells was reduced and the number of intraepithelial CD3+ cells was also reduced, while the CD8 and CD4 cells showed no changes. Apparently there is an induction of an immunosuppressive phe notype with downregulation of an adaptive immune response through the reduction in the CD8+ T and Bcells.",

The disease has been reproduced with pure cul tures of B. hyodysenteriae in conventional and SPF pigs. Challenge of gnotobiotic pigs with pure cultures results in colonization, but disease does not occur until other intestinal organisms are given, which suggests that the disease is the result of a mixed synergistic infection of the spirochete and other intesti nal anaerobic organisms. These results and others are consistent with the concept that B. hyodysenteriae is the primary causative agent of swine dysentery and that the presence of one or more other anaerobes is a prerequisite for expression of pathogenicity of B. hyo dysenteriae. This prerequisite can be met by a variety of anaerobes. There is considerable variation in virulence among strains of differ ent serotypes of B. hyodysenteriae when given orally to SPF piglets or mice. A virulent B. hyodysenteriae has been isolated from a herd free of clinical swine dysentery, which indicates that the organism can still be present in herds considered to be free of the disease.

Treatment of swine dysentery with the more efficacious drugs has been shown to inhibit the develop ment of this immunity and serum antibody to B. hyodysenteriae. However, the clinical significance of this is undermined, and at present it is suggested that outbreaks of swine dysentery be treated vigorously.",

In other words, swine dysentery was caused by an entirely different agent. The isolates were found to be different from all known Brachyspira spp. on the basis of the nox gene, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, and biochemical testing. The organism is called B. hampsonii after David Hampson, who contributed so much to the study of Brachyspira. To identify the organ ism, the duplex PCR was first used to dif ferentiate or eliminate B. hyodysenteriae and BP, and then PCR was used to identify the nox gene. The PCR products were then sequenced and then multilocus typing was used. 2, 3 The results of this typing grouped the isolates into two clades (I and II), which formed a cluster independent of each other. Most of clade I was positive for \u03b2glucosidase and clade II negative for this enzyme. This organism is strongly \u03b2hemolytic but is indole negative, which distinguishes it from B. hyodysenteriae and B. suanatina, which are the other \u03b2hemolytic Brachyspira.",

BP can virtually eat its way through from the lumen to the lamina propria. They spread extracellularly in the underlying lamina propria and are phagocytosed by the macrophages and also enter the capillary blood vessels.

It has been suggested that the herds are mainly the high yielding wellmanaged herds. There is con siderable variability between the litters; particularly the gilts and second litter sows may be affected. The length of parturition in the affected litters was longer than in the unaffected herds. The proportion of piglets born late was higher. Levels of antibodies in colostrum varied, but there was no evidence of differences in quality of colostrum. No consistent pattern emerged in the herds, and no consistent pattern of microbiological observations has been found. Piglet serum IgG is a reflection of the rate of absorption from the gut, which depends on the level of IgG in the colostrum and in turn depends on the level of maternal antibody in the sow. There were normal amounts of milk in the stomach of affected pigs; there were no obvious gross lesions; they were not dehy drated; the small intestines were contracted, or atonic, and dilated; hyperemia was rare, and intestinal contents were yellowish and aqueous. The intestinal mucosa was not inflamed and the lymph nodes were reactive. The colon had no changes, and the contents were creamy or watery. In the Danish labo ratories 55% of the cases had nonhemolytic E. coli and 7% hemolytic E. coli that was mostly O7, 16% had ETEC, C. perfringens type A was found in 80%, C. difficile was found in 12%, and rotavirus was also found in 12%. Only 1/220 samples had C. perfringens type C. Four Danish pig herds with NNDS were investigated. 2 This has occurred since 2008 and is characterized by a nonresponse to treatment or to management therapies. No pathogens have been detected in the past, and in this investigation no pathogens were detected either. Macroscopically, these pigs had filled stomachs and flaccid intestines without mucosal changes. The predominant histologic changes were villous atrophy in the jejunum and ileum. Epithelial lesions were seen in the colon in onethird of the cases. In the Danish cases it was found that (1) microbiological testing was not sufficient to explain the problem, (2) histopathology was generally inconclusive, (3) E. coli and C. perfringens type A are found in normal pigs and are therefore not considered to be important, and (4) the role of C. difficile under Danish conditions has not been elucidated.",

During the past three decades, TGE has changed from a sporadic disease that histori cally occurred in the midwestern United States to an endemic disease in most coun tries of the northern hemisphere. It can cause severe disease even in seronegative herds, especially if the protection of porcine respi ratory coronavirus (PRCV) is missing. In Asia, TGE and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) often cocirculate. In densely swine populated areas, such as the midwestern United States, the disease is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in young pigs. The disease has not been diagnosed in Australia and New Zealand. In 1990, the prevalence of infection in the United Kingdom was low, with 0.6% of sows sampled being seropositive compared with 3% in 1984. No major epidemics have occurred since 1981. In 1984, a seroconversion to the TGE virus occurred in a closed herd in the absence of any clinical disease. The TGE virus was not isolated, and it is possible that the seroconversion resulted from the emer gence of PRCV throughout Europe and the United Kingdom beginning in 1986. PRCV is a deletion mutant of the TGE virus, and its high rate of prevalence has markedly reduced the number of TGE outbreaks in European swine herds. The TGE virus probably coex ists in these herds together with PRCV. In 1999, a single case was diagnosed in East Yorkshire as a oneoff. Other isolated out breaks in herds that were seropositive for PRCV were also reported. An outbreak of TGE occurred in the United Kingdom in 1996 in which the virus was a variant with an intact spike gene but with a large deletion in ORF 3a, which therefore may not be nec essary for enteric virulence.",

In other words, it pro vides crossprotection. Infection with PRCV produces high levels of interferon and nitric oxide in the lungs. 4, 5 Despite the antigenic relation of PRCV and the TGE virus, they can be differentiated with monoclonal anti bodies. All PRCV strains have around 600 to 700 nucleotide (nt) deletions within the aminoterminal S gene, resulting in the loss of hemagglutination activity and two anti genic sites. European PRCVs have an identi cal deletion of 672 nt at the same position, whereas U.S. strains have 621 to 681 nt dele tions located at different positions, which suggests that they arose separately. Natural infection of the sow with PRCV induces natural antibodies that neutralize classic TGE. The virus has spread throughout Europe and has been identified in the United States and Canada. Spread of the virus has been explained in part by airborne transmis sion, and infection shows a seasonal pattern, affecting farms during winter and spring. Seroprevalence studies in Belgium indicate that 95% of sows are PRCV positive. Nearly all piglets are infected by 10 to 15 days of age. The infection is widespread in swine herds in Spain. The risk factors associated with sero positivity in Danish swine herds include (a) increasing herd size, (b) certain geographical locations, (c) presence of a slurry system with slatted floors, and (d) purchase of pigs.

Recrudescence of clinical disease is usually of much shorter duration than the primary outbreak and commonly lasts only 6 to 10 days. The periods of recrudescence are commonly precipitated by the simultaneous farrowing of several sus ceptible gilts in the same farrowing room. Of greater longterm concern is that approxi mately 50% of some large herds continue to experience clinical recrudescences for almost 2 years or more. The endemic form of the disease appears to be correlated with herds of more than 100 sows and herds in which fin ishing pigs were kept. In large herds, the virus may spread more slowly, and replacement gilts entering the herd may take several months to become infected and to serocon vert. In large herds, the rapid turnover of breeding stock, continuous farrowing, and early weaning also contribute to the perpetu ation of an endemic infection, and thus TGE can maintain itself through the slow and incomplete spread of the virus among adult pigs, particularly herd replacements. Joint infection with PRRS and TGE does not appear to affect the clinical effects, shedding, or persistence of either virus. The economic losses can be very large. Simulation of the economic losses resulting from an outbreak of disease in Australia, where the disease is exotic, estimated a reduction in net revenue of 70% in the 6 months after a moderate outbreak (50% mortality of piglets under 1 week of age) and 100% for a severe outbreak (95% mortality of piglets under 1 week of age).

Vaccination of sows orally with a nonattenuated vaccine provides greater levels of lactogenic protection than does orally or parenterally administered attenuatedvirus vaccine. In vaccinated sows, the levels of colostral antibody correlate with the percentage of survivability of their piglets when challengeexposed at 3 to 5 days, whereas the serum antibody to TGEv does not. There is also a significant relationship between milk antibody and percentage sur vivability when pigs are challengeexposed at 5 days of age but not at 3 days of age. There is a need to develop an attenuated virus strain that is completely avirulent for pigs but that also replicates sufficiently in the small intestine of sows after oral administration and induces secretory IgA antibody. It appears that no strains of the virus have been identified that are sufficiently attenuated and safe for pigs while still being able to provide a sufficient immune stimulus in the intestine of the sow. The Nouzilly strain, which is a mutant type of TGEv resistant to acidity and the proteases of the digestive tracts of adult pigs, is being evaluated as a vaccine.",

Piglets born from vaccinated sows were challenged at 4 to 5d ays of age with the virulent virus, and the morbidity was 100%, with mortality ranging from 20% to 80%. The same vaccine given subcutaneously to 11dayold piglets induced VN antibodies. This is consistent with the wellknown observation that secre tory IgA antibody in the milk is necessary for protection in piglets. Compared to VN anti bodies, antibodies of the secretory IgA class are more effective at neutralizing TGEv because they are at higher titers in milk, are more resistant to proteolytic enzymes, and bind to gastrointestinal enterocytes. Protec tive immunity to transmissible gastroenteri tis correlates with milk whey secretory IgA antibody titer to the TGE virus when pigs are challengeexposed with the virulent virus at 3 to 5 days of age.",

There is indirect evidence that a bronchialassociated lym phoid tissue (BALT)-mammary gland link similar to the gutassociated lymphoid tissue (GALT)-mammary gland link described for TGEv may exist in pregnant, multiplePRCV exposed sows. In herds infected with PRCV, multiple exposures of pregnant sows are asso ciated with higher IgA and IgG antibody titers to TGEv in milk, and these titers contribute to protection against TGEv. The immunization of pregnant gilts with PRCV induces lacto genic immunity and partial protection of piglets from challenge with TGEv. An overall survival rate of 70% was found for piglets nursing PRCVinfected gilts compared with a 16% survival rate for piglets nursing control gilts. The highest degree of protection occurs in sows primed with PRCV, then given a booster vaccination with TGEv 2 weeks later. Infection of pigs with PRCV primes the sys temic and mucosal humoral immune system against TGEv, and subsequent challenge with TGEv results in a secondary antibody response and decreased duration of excretion of the virus. Protective immunity to TGEv infection can also be induced in piglets exposed to PRCV at 2 to 6 days of age.",

It has been suggested that 90% of the infection may be through the tonsil. A large amount of virus is in the tissues before the clinical signs develop. Once infection is established in a pig, virus excretion is so massive it results in infection of others in the group through the tonsil and gastrointestinal tract as well as through skin abrasions. Massive amounts of the virus are excreted in the feces. Experi mentally, the disease can be reproduced by intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intradermal inoculation of virus. Virus spreads at the site of infection and enters the bloodstream through the lymphatics. It is followed by viremia, which may last 2 to 3 days. Recent research has suggested that the virus can persist for a longer length of time for up to 63 days, but at 119 DPI the virus was again found in feces when two groups of pigs were mixed. This suggests that the virus and RNA can persist for a long time and possibly suggests a carrier state, but the same authors also suggest that persistent infection is rare. Most virus is produced during the first week, but lesions are infective for a long time. The virus has a special affinity for epi thelium of the coronary band, tongue, lip, and snout, and for myocardium.

Lameness, arching of the back, and other signs of foot discomfort are evident but are less severe than with FMD. Very occa sionally they walk on the knees or scream. The incidence of lameness and of foot lesions are influenced by management and are less severe on bedding or with soft conditions underfoot. Characteristic vesicles occur at predilection sites frequently associated with trauma. They are most common on the coro nary band of the claws, especially at the heel, and of the supernumerary digits. They start as areas of blanching and swelling and pro gress in 1 to 2 days to thickwalled vesicles that rupture, giving the appearance of an ulcer. Sometimes pigs may have a retracted recovery. In severely affected pigs, the lesions will encircle the coronary band and the horn may be shed as in FMD. Lesions also occur on the tongue, lips, and snout and the skin of the legs and belly. They are much less fre quent in these areas and frequently do not progress to typical vesicles. An examination of the feet of other apparently normal pigs within the group will often reveal the pres ence of minor lesions, and the extent of involvement of pigs within the group may be underestimated without careful examina tion. In some outbreaks, the incidence of clinical lesions has been minimal and even a single vesicle on the pig's foot should be treated as suspect. Some pigs show no clinical signs but develop significant titers of neutral izing antibody. The course of the disease within a group is generally 2 to 3 weeks, mor tality is very uncommon, and there is only a minor setback to production unless complete separation of the horny foot occurs.

This change in taxonomy has caused and will be causing confusion as long as both terminologies appear in the medical litera ture. The way former Salmonella species and now serovars were designated changed with time. Initially the serovar name denoted a syndrome (e.g., S. typhi) or hostsyndrome combinations (e.g., S. abortus-ovis, S. abortus-equi). Later serovars were designated by the geographic origin of the first identified strain of the serovar in question (e.g., S. dublin, S. london). When the new nomencla ture was introduced names were retained for serovars of subspecies enterica, which com prises the great majority of isolated serovars, because these names were so familiar. In contrast, serovars of other subspecies are now designated by their antigenic formula. 1 Salmonella serovars differ in the range of hosts they can infect and in the nature of disease that may result: this difference is referred to as serovar-host specificity. So called ubiquitous serovars such as S. Typhimurium or S. Enteritidis can affect a wide range of hosts and produce acute but selflimiting illness. Host-specific serovars, such as S. Typhi in humans or S. Gallinarum in poultry affect only a single species, and are associated with severe illness that does not necessarily include diarrhea. Host-restricted serovars primarily affect one specific species, but can also cause illness in a limited number of other species. Such serovars are, for example, SD, primarily affecting cattle or SCS, primarily affecting pigs. 3 The serovars that most commonly cause salmonellosis in farm animal species are as follows:",

The most common serovars isolated in the 2007 study were, in descending order, S. Cerro, S. Kentucky, S. Montevideo, S. Muenster, S. Meleagridis, S. Mbandaka, and S. Newport. A study conducted in one large U.S. feedlot receiving calves from the Midwest and High Plains found a prevalence of culturepositive environmental samples in cohorts at the time of feedlot entry of 64.7%. 5 The predominantly isolated serotypes in this study were S. Anatum, S. Montevideo, S. Orion, S. Kentucky, S. Mbandaka, and S. Newport. The geographic distribution of the serotypes differs: S. Typhimurium has a uni versal distribution and SD has a patchier habitat. In the United States, up until 1948, it was limited to California and as recently as 1971 it had not been reported in cattle east of the Rocky Mountains. In 1980 the first case of SD occurred in Indiana. The movement of infected adult cattle and calves is responsible for the introduction of infection to areas in which it had not previously been diagnosed. In a California survey of 60 dairy herds, milk samples and serum samples tested with an ELISA for antibodies against Salmonella serogroups B, C1, and D1 antigens found that 75% of dairy herds surveyed had cows with serologic evidence of recent exposure to sal monellas, especially S.

The proportion of positive composite fecal samples stratified by sheep type was 38.2% for ewes nursing lambs; 30.9% for the group of nursing lambs, market lambs, and replace ment ewes; and 29.1% for pregnant ewes and others. 9 By far the most prevalent serovar was S. enterica subsp. diarizonae IIIb:61 :1,5,7 accounting for 94.6% of all isolates. S. Enteritidis and S. Newport com bined accounted for only 4% of all isolates, whereas S. Typhimurium was not isolated. 9 Abattoir studies conducted in different countries reported prevalences of culture positive samples of sheep between 0.1% in the UK and 40% in Australia. 10 In a recent Australian abattoir study, Salmonella spp. were isolated from 20% of fecal samples and 13% of fleeces in slaughtered sheep. 11 Another Australian study used a multiplex qPCR to determine the prevalence of S. enterica in fecal samples collected from lambs at weaning, postweaning, and pre slaughter from eight farms across four states. The overall prevalence of Salmonella-positive fecal samples was 5.0%, but wide variations among states were found. Highest prevalence rates were determined in New South Wales in lambs at weaning (18.1%) and postwean ing (23.8%). 10 S. Abortusovis is an ovinerestricted serovar that represents a common cause of abortion and mortality in newborn lambs in Western Asia. 12 Infections have been reported from France, Spain, Germany, Cyprus, Italy, Switzerland, Russia, and Bulgaria, but few infection prevalence studies are available. A recent Swiss study determined the sero prevalence of S. Abortusovis infection in sheep flocks in 2007 after a series of abortion storms that had occurred between 2003 and 2007 throughout the country. Before 2003 abortion caused by S. Abortusovis had not been reported for several decades in this country. Overall an animal seroprevalence of 1.7% and a flock prevalence of 16.3% were found. 13 Horses Few infection prevalence studies conducted in nonclinical horses have been conducted. The National Animal Health Monitoring System Equine 1998 study that included over 8000 horses on nearly 1000 operations across the country reported prevalence of culture positive fecal samples of 0.8%. At least one horse on 1.8% of operations was estimated to shed salmonellas in feces. 14 A total of 14 dif ferent serotypes were isolated with the most common serotype being S. Muenchen.",

Thus persistence of infection in animals and in the environ ment is an important epidemiologic feature of salmonellosis. A cow infected with SD may become a clinical case or an active carrier, shedding organisms constantly or intermittently in the feces. It may alterna tively become a latent carrier with infection persisting in lymph nodes or tonsils but no salmonellas in the feces, or even a passive carrier, which is constantly acquiring infec tion from pasture or the calfpen floor. In passive carriers invasion of tissues does not occur, and when the animal is removed from the environment the infection disappears. However, passive carriers probably multiply the salmonellas, contributing to the epidemi ology of the pathogen. Latent carriers can become active carriers or even clinical cases under stress, especially at calving time or during illness. A major problem with the control of SD infection is that latent carriers of the organism, unlike persistent excreters, cannot be readily identified by fecal culture or serologic methods. In a 3year study of one dairy herd, the organism was isolated occasionally from the feces of adult cattle, from some cattle after parturition, and from some calves within 24 hours after birth.

Typhimurium is sporadic and, even though it is fatal to individual animals, it is not a serious disease. Although there are probably similar differences with the other species, they are not particularly well defined. The difference between the diseases associ ated with SD and S. Typhimurium is the marked tendency for SD to persist in adult cattle and create a significant reservoir of carrier animals. S. Typhimurium does not do so as much, so that the disease is likely to subside after an initial exposure and to recur only when the source of infection, from rodents or feedstuffs, or sewage or slurry, reappears. This does not preclude the disease from persisting in a flock or herd for long periods. S. Typhimurium infection persisted in a large dairy herd for 3.5 years. Although the incidence rate of clinical disease declined over the study period, the organism could still be cultured from the bulk tank milk filters, which may have been associated with one cow identified as a milk excretor.

The response to infection with a Salmonella sp. varies depending on the size of the challenge dose and the immunologic status of the animal, itself dependent on colostrum intake in neonates, as well as previous exposure to infection and exposure to stressors, particu larly in older animals.

In lethal infections, the early growth of the bac teria in the tissues results in high bacterial numbers that lead to death of the animal. Following natural infection with Salmonella antibody, responses to LPS and protein deter minants can be detected. AntiSalmonella IgM appear in serum early after infection fol lowed by IgG.

The resistance is usually to multiple antimicrobi als and its existence is considered as a poten tial risk factor. The significance of AMR is most obvious in its impact on the treatment of human infections. AMR of Salmonella spp. causing clinical disease leads to increased morbidity, mortality, and treatment costs and limits the choice of antimicrobials for the treatment of systemic salmonellosis in humans. 26 Antimicrobialresistant Salmonella infections can further complicate anti microbial therapy of other infections; prior antimicrobial therapy allows fewer numbers of antimicrobialresistant salmonellas to cause symptomatic infections, and an increase in the proportion of salmonellas that are antimicrobial resistant will increase the overall frequency of salmonellosis. Infec tions in humans associated with antimicro bialresistant salmonellas are increasing and have become a cause for public health concern. Resistance to third and fourth generation cephalosporins and fluoroquino lones is considered of greatest public health importance, because these are the antimicro bials of particular relevance for the treatment of human salmonellosis. 27 The prevalence of Salmonella isolates that are antimicrobialresistant varies widely between countries, animal species, and serovars. National and speciesspecific dif ferences have been attributed to differences in the practice of antimicrobial use between animal species, production systems, and countries. Generally, AMR among salmonel las is higher in the United States than in other countries, is more common in isolates from swine than from other species, and is more common in serovar Typhimurium than in other Salmonella serovars.

The disease in horses usually occurs in a single animal and is sporadic. However, outbreaks do occur in newborn foals, in groups of horses recently transported, and in horses hospitalized in veterinary clinics. Analysis of spatial and temporal clustering of horses with salmonellosis in an intensive care unit of a veterinary teaching hospital suggested that affected horses were grouped in time. Experimental infection of horses by oral administration of S. Typhimurium produces a disease similar to the natural disease. The incubation period may be as short as 24 hours. The following four syn dromes occur: \u2022 Asymptomatic shedding of S. Typhimurium in feces intermittently or continuously for short periods of 4 to 6 days \u2022 A subacute enteric form in adult horses on farms in which the disease is endemic, with fever, depression, and anorexia but without severe diarrhea, although the feces may have the consistency of soft bovine feces. There is no other obvious intestinal abnormality. There may be a neutropenia with a left shift. \u2022 Severe, acute fulminating enteritis with diarrhea, fever, dehydration, and neutropenia occurs. There is abdominal pain, which may be sufficiently severe to stimulate violent actions. This is the common form of the disease, occurring commonly in adults that are exposed to stress in one form or another. Newborn and young foals up to 8 days of age also often have this form of the disease, characterized by depression, anorexia, and diarrhea. \u2022 In foals up to about 2 days of age there is a highly fatal septicemia.

Clinical findings included head tilt, seizures, and diarrhea. S. Abortusequi has become a rare, only occurring in few countries worldwide. Infec tion with this serovar is associated with abor tion in the last third of gestation, followed by retained placenta and metritis. Foals born alive may develop acute septicemia in the first week of life or polyarthritis in the second week of life.

A major complicating factor is the occurrence of apparently healthy carriers, which shed the organism intermittently and in low numbers, and silent carriers, which do not shed Salmonella in feces but harbor the organism in mesenteric lymph nodes or in the mucosa of the cecum and colon. The dif ficulty varies according to genotype. Host adapted serovars (e.g., SD in cattle or S. Abortusovis in sheep) are more difficult to isolate from feces than serovars with a broader host range such as S. Typhimurium. In cattle with SD infection, the bacteria are present in the blood and milk for a very brief period during the bacteremic phase and before diarrhea commences. Cows near calving are most likely to be shedding Salmonella in the feces. Multiple cultures at 24hour intervals were found to be superior to single fecal cultures for the diagnosis of clinical sal monellosis in horses; currently at least five consecutive fecal samples are recommended to rule out the carrier state in an individual animal with over 95% confidence. 21 The organism can be cultured from tissue, body fluids, fecal samples, bulk tank milk, milk filters, water, feed, and environmental sites.

Issues are in part derived from experience in human medicine where invasive infection with Salmonella is uncommon and antimi crobial therapy is discouraged. 23 However, bacteremia is frequently encountered in cattle with acute enteritis, and septicemia is a feature of clinical salmonellosis in foals, calves, and lambs. In acute cases of clinical salmonellosis with suspected or confirmed bacteremia it would be professionally negli gent not to treat affected animals with appropriate antimicrobials. There is indeed evidence that antimicrobials can prolong the duration of the period after clinical recovery from acute and in particular from chronic enteritis in humans and animals during which the causative bacteria can be isolated from the intestine. It is accepted that this can occur and that the use of antimicrobials may contribute to the spread of disease. Another related issue is the creation of drugresistant strains.

The principal sources of infection are carrier animals and contaminated feeds containing foodstuffs of animal origin. There is a critical need to develop methods to control the spread of Salmonella infections on dairy farms by instituting biosecurity and biocontainment practices in addition to enhanced farm man agement. This would result in a reduction in the use of excessive antibiotic treatment of individual animals or herds. A closed herd minimizes the risk of infec tion but is not a practicable procedure for the types of animal producer (the calfrearer and the commercial pig fattener) for which sal monellosis is a major problem. For such pro ducers the following rules apply: \u2022 Introduce the animals directly from the farm of origin. Avoid auction marts, saleyards, and public transport, all of which are likely to be sources of infection. Ensure that the farm of origin is free of salmonellosis. \u2022 If possible, purchase animals when they are older, such as 6 weeks of age for calves, to provide an opportunity for specific and nonspecific immunity to develop. Animals from vaccinated herds are desirable. \u2022 The premises of dealers, saleyards, and transport vehicles must be under close surveillance and the need for frequent vigorous disinfection must be stressed. The infection rate in calves delivered to calfdealers' yards in the UK was less than 1%, but the infection rate increased to 36% if the calves were kept on the premises over the weekend. \u2022 Introduce only those animals likely not to be carriers. Unfortunately the detection of carriers is inaccurate and expensive. To have any confidence in the results, fecal samples for culture must be submitted on at least three occasions. Even then, occasional carriers with lesions in the gallbladder or tonsils will escape the net and be capable of reviving the disease on the farm or transferring it to another one. Management practices to reduce the risk of S. Brandenburg on a sheep farm include reducing stocking density; avoiding strip grazing; maintaining adequate nutrition; minimizing yarding of ewes and the time spent in yards; dampening down yards before yarding; providing stock with a fresh clean source of drinking water; avoiding the pur chase and/or grazing of stock from known affected farms, as they may contain carrier animals; preventing dogs from scavenging; and preventing scavenging by blackbacked gulls by removing and burying aborted fetuses frequently during the lambing season.",

            "text": "Overall disease occurrence and mortality of neonatal calves has been shown to be influenced by feeding practices. Adequate energy and nutrient supply are critically important for proper immune function. In the dairy industry it is customary to limit the daily feed supply of unweaned calves to 10% to 15% BW, a procedure also known as \"restricted feeding. \" The objective of restricted feeding is to facilitate early weaning and to decrease the risk of diarrhea. Not withstanding the voluntary intake of calves fed whole milk ad libitum can easily exceed double this amount, and it was shown that calves can safely ingest milk equivalent to 20% of their BW and achieve markedly higher daily weight gains than calves on restricted feeding. 8 The effect of feeding larger amounts of milk on the incidence of diarrhea was studied with inconsistent results; some studies have reported higher diarrhea incidence when feeding larger volumes while others did not. 8 Feeding milk replacer instead of whole milk also presents a form of undernutrition, particularly during the cold season of the year, when the energetic requirements of the calf are increased. The energy density and the digestibility of proteins contained in commercial milk replacers are generally speaking lower than in whole milk, which has been proposed to predispose to impaired immune function and thus to disease. A study comparing calves fed the same amount of whole milk or milk replacer in a commer cial dairy farm found that mortality rates in both groups were similar during summer but differed dramatically during winter between calves fed whole milk (2.8%) and milk replacer (21.0%). 9 Some studies have shown that the major contributing factor to dairy calf mor tality is the care provided by the calf attendant.",

A common practice is feeding medicated milk or milk replacer during the first weeks of life, which is a practice that has been associated with reduced calf morbidity and mortality and increased daily weight gains particularly in herds with a high prevalence of FTPI and high infectious pressure. 10 In contrast, this effect was much less pronounced over even the opposite in a wellmanaged herd with low FTPI prevalences. In wellmanaged herds calves fed a medicated milk replacer had over 30% more days with diarrhea than herd mates receiving nonmedicated milk replacer. 10 Although antimicrobial therapy is clearly indicated in diarrheic calves with signs of systemic disease, antibiotics may be coun terproductive in scouring calves without systemic illness. 11 Scouring calves without systemic illness that were treated with anti biotics in addition to oral rehydration had 70% more days with diarrhea than calves without systemic disease that received oral rehydration without antibiotics. 12 Other Environmental and Management Factors Cold, wet, and windy weather during the winter months in temperate climates and hot humid weather during the summer months may be associated with an increased inci dence of dairy calf mortality caused by diar rhea. Changes in weather and wet, windy, and cold weather are commonly associated with subsequent outbreaks of the disease in beef calves raised outdoors.

Producers that managed their farrowing barns as allin/ allout facilities had lower diarrhearelated morbidity and mortality rates. 13 Herd size was found to have a positive association with piglet morbidity but not mortality related to diarrhea. 13 Piglets in litters receiving milk replacer as feed supplement were at increased risk of developing diarrhea (OR 1.9) compared with piglets that did not. Although the explana tion for this observation is not evident, it was suggested that feed supplementation might either be associated with increased occur rence of hypogalactia or agalactia in sows, or the provision of milk replacers reduces the voluntary intake of sow's milk. 13 Other management practices that were associated with reduced diarrhea incidence in piglets were the parenteral administration of iron to piglets and vaccination of the sow herd against E.coli. 13 Increasing the percent age of gilts among the sow population was associated with increasing diarrhea inci dence in the herd. 14 Seasonal effects have also been reported with highest diarrhea incidence rates in piglets occurring during the cold season of the year. 15 Lambs Management factors associated with diar rhea in neonatal lambs were animal density in pens, cleaning frequency of lambing pens, and the use of anthelminthic drugs. 16, 17 Conflicting results regarding the effect of the flock size on diarrhea incidence in lambs have been published.

Mixed infections are common. Rotavirus will be most common in some groups, especially housed calves. Coronavirus may predomi nate in beef calves in some countries, and Cryptosporidium spp. may occur in 30% to 50% of diarrheic calves on a worldwide basis. Cryptosporidium spp., rotavirus, and corona virus are the most commonly identified enteropathogens in intensively reared veal calves. In dairy calves, the prevalence of giar diasis and cryptosporidiosis may be high and both parasites may be associated with diar rhea. C. parvum is an important pathogen in calves under 1 month of age, but Giardia duodenalis may be more important in older calves. Calves may clear C. parvum infec tions within 2 weeks, whereas G. duodenalis infection may become chronic in the same calves. The combination of Cryptosporidium spp. and rotavirus may predominate in some situations. Cryptosporidium spp. were the second most commonly detected pathogens next to rotavirus, and case-control studies indicated a highly significant association with diarrhea. Enteropathogens may not be detectable in up to 30% of diarrheic calves. Eimeria spp. can cause coccidiosis in calves any time after about 21 days after birth, but the disease is more common in calves several months old.",

C. difficile causes enterocolitis in horses of any age and is associated with diarrhea in neonatal pigs. Strains of C. difficile pathogenic to horses produce two toxins, A and B, and the degree of pathogenicity is related to the capacity for toxin production. 1 There are numerous strains of C. difficile (>50 ribotypes by one estimate), although a much smaller number (~4) constitutes the predominant isolates in animals. 2 Ribotype 078 is the most com monly reported in animals, especially in pigs and cattle, 3 although common human ribo types (014/020 and 002) also occur in animals.

            "text": "The microbiota of horses is complex and clostridial species are common in the feces of healthy horses, although C. difficile (mostly nontoxinogenic) is isolated from <10% of horses on single sampling. 57 How ever, monthly sampling of 25 healthy horses for 1 year detected toxinogenic C. difficile in 40% of horses at least once, 8 and toxinogenic C. difficile was detected in 7 of 55 healthy race horses examined once during summer in Ohio, suggesting that asymptomatic car riage of toxinogenic strains by some popula tions of healthy horses is relatively common. 9 Detection of toxigenic C. difficile is often, but not always, associated with disease in horses of any age, as demonstrated by the dispro portionate representation of this organism in feces of horses with diarrhea. 68, 1014 Seven of 14 foals with diarrhea had C. difficile toxin (A/B) identified in feces, whereas none of 139 healthy foals were positive. 15 C. difficile was detected only in foals with gastro intestinal disease, and not in healthy foals (OR 5.4) , in central Kentucky. 14 C. difficile toxin(s) is detected in approximately 5% of hospitalized foals with diarrhea, 10 and C. difficile was isolated from 10 of 73 hospitalized horses, 7 of which were positive for toxin A and/or B. 16 There was no association of C. difficile with a particular disease in this study. 16 One or both animals in mare-foal pairs can be subclinically infected with C. difficile and are potentially a source of infec tion for the other. 11 This is exemplified by the development of acute C. difficile enterocolitis in mares of foals treated with erythromycin and rifampin. Both C. perfringens (type A) and C. difficile can simultaneously infect foals with severe enterocolitis not associated with administration of antimicrobials, sug gesting the potential for an interaction resulting in more severe disease. 4 There is a strong anecdotal association of C. difficileassociated enterocolitis in horses with the administration of antimicrobials. Although most clinicians would agree that this association exists, there is no evidence that quantifies the increase in risk of a horse developing C. difficileassociated disease with the administration of antimicrobials or particular antimicrobials. Antimicrobial administration was not significantly more likely in horses with C. difficileassociated diarrhea than in horses with diarrhea from which C. difficile was not identified, and only 26% of hospitalized horses with C. difficile associated diarrhea had been administered antimicrobials. 17 Thirtytwo of 33 (97%) horses and all adult horses with C. difficile associated diarrhea had been administered antimicrobials before onset of diarrhea com pared with 48% to 79% of horses with diar rhea of other causes. 18 Horses with longer duration of hos pitalization before onset of diarrhea are more likely to develop C. difficileassociated diarrhea. 18 Pigs C. difficile has increasing reportage, or recog nition, and occurs predominantly in young piglets but also is recorded as a major cause of disease and mortality in sows. 19 The disease occurs worldwide and is an impor tant cause of loss of young piglets. 20, 21 The disease in piglets occurs predominantly in the first week of life, when the majority of the litter can be affected, and the case fatality can approach 50% but is usually lower. Stunt ing is a common sequel. Outbreaks occur with or without a history of processing with antibiotics.",

Farms without evidence of endemic clini cal disease had lower mean titers and lower maximal titers in individual horses than did farms on which the disease was endemic. Whether this finding is a reflection of prev alence of the disease (i.e., a consequence of high disease prevalence on some farms) or reflects greater exposure of horses that subsequently develop disease is unclear. 12 Approximately 50% of mares on farms with endemic disease are seropositive and ~50% of foals acquire passive immunity (become seropositive after nursing) from mares, and these maternally derived antibodies persist for 1 to 3 months. 13 Thirty percent of foals have evidence of infection, but not disease. 13 The organism was not detected in foals with signs of gastrointestinal disease in Ken tucky in one study, 9 although the disease is endemic in the area. 14 The disease occurs almost exclusively during late summer and early winter in Kentucky. 14 Affected foals are usually 3 to 13 months of age and disease in adults is rare. 15 There is insufficient information to determine whether there is a breed predisposition to the disease. The disease is presumably transmitted by the fecal-oral route, with mares a potential, but unproven, source of infection. 16 Proliferative enteropathy in foals occurs as isolated cases and as outbreaks on breed ing farms. There is evidence that outbreaks begin after introduction of foals or weanlings to farms with no history of the disease, although whether this is coincidence or rep resents the mechanism of introduction of infection to the farm is unknown. Morbidity among foals and weanlings on affected farms is 20% to 25%, although this is based on disease outbreaks on only two farms. Casefatality rate is as low as 7% in treated foals. 14",

Most horses with disease caused by N. risticii have titers \u22651 : 80 at the onset of clinical signs, whereas horses with titers \u22641 : 40 probably do not have the disease. The presence of a high titer at the time of onset of clinical signs is a result of the 8 to 12day incubation period during which there is a high level of neorickettsemia and the pro duction of a strong IgM antibody response. The IgM antibody response wanes rapidly and can be undetectable by 60 days after infection, although a prominent IgG response occurs. Therefore by the time clinical signs are apparent the horse has a high titer that might decline, making the use of acute and convalescent (2 weeks after clinical signs resolve) serum titers potentially misleading. A rising titer in samples collected several days apart soon after the onset of disease is indicative of the disease, but a declining titer does not rule it out.

An inactivated wholecell adju vanted vaccine is available, and vaccinated animals have resistance to experimental challenge. However, protection from vacci nation is not complete and wanes within 6 months.

The putative causative agent is equine coronavirus (ECoV), and the strains identified in Japan, France, and the United States are virtually identical to the strain initially isolated from foals in North Carolina. 14 There is some variation in the virus, principally within p4.7 and the noncoding region following the p4.7 gene. 5 ECoV is of the genus Betacoronavirus and the species Betacoronavirus1, which includes BCoV, porcine HEV, and canine respiratory coronavirus. 6 Experimental inoculation of adult horses reproduces the disease. 7 The association between coronavirus infection and clinical disease in adult horses is reported in Japan, North America, and Europe. 15, 8 Animal risk factors have not been identified, and the disease occurs in horses from 1 to 29 years of age. 2, 5, 8 The disease in adult horses is most commonly reported as an outbreak in stables affecting 15% to 60% of horses. 2, 4, 5 The case-fatality rate is approxi mately 0% to 7% with deaths caused by acute, profuse diarrhea; septicemia; or signs of neu rologic disease. 2, 5, 8 A case-fatality rate of 27% is reported in two outbreaks of disease in Miniature horses and Miniature donkeys. 8 Transmission is assumed to be fecal-oral, but the importance of fomites is spread within a stable, and longevity of the virus in the environment is not reported. The virus can be detected in feces for at least 12 to 14 days after oral inoculation of horses, 7 although the median shedding time from onset of clinical signs in horses with sponta neous disease is 4 days. 8 The incubation period for horses experi mentally infected with ECoV is 2 to 4 days before development of fever or anorexia. 7 The main clinical signs are anorexia, leth argy, and fever (43) . Approximately 10% of affected horses have diarrhea and colic in approximately 2% of horses. 2, 5 Horses that die do so with rapid progression of the disease including profuse diarrhea, septice mia, or neurologic disease. Depression, ataxia, and recumbency with abnormally high blood ammonia concentrations are sug gestive of intestinal hyperammonemia. 8 Clinical signs generally resolved within 1 to 4 days with supportive care. Outbreaks last approximately 3 weeks. 2, 5 Affected horses are leukopenic (neutro penic). 2, 5 Serum amyloid A concentrations increase in experimentally infected horses 2 to 4 days after inoculation with the virus. 7 Serology is useful for demonstrating sero conversion to ECoV or high titers in recov ered horses. 35 The virus can be detected in feces and blood, but not nasal discharges, in nonexperimental cases using PCR tech nology. 2,3 Reverse transcription and loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay are less sensitive but cheaper than RTPCR technology for detection of the virus. 9 The virus is more frequently recov ered from feces of clinically affected horses during outbreaks, and viral load in feces is associated with severity of disease. 2, 3, 8 Treatment is supportive. There is no vaccine. Control is facilitated by implemen tation of measures to reduce viral spread, such as strict limitations on movement of horses within the facility, use of sanitary procedures including disinfectants, and ces sation of racing or competition until the outbreak has abated. Most commonly used disinfectants are efficacious in reducing infectivity of coronavirus on surfaces, includ ing benzalkonium and glutaraldehyde as well as alcoholbased hand disinfectants.",

The incidence of diar rhea in herds not vaccinated in the previous year was compared with the incidence during the year of vaccination, which is inadequate to assess the efficacy of the vaccine. Field trials using the oral vaccine indicate a failure of protection of calves against rota virus infection and rotavirus-coronavirus infection. Effective oral vaccination of calves may be hindered by the presence of specific antibodies in the colostrum (the colostrum barrier) and may explain the failure of the vaccine under field conditions. The intestinal antibody response of young calves to an enteric viral infection is associated with the production of IgM and IgA antibodies locally in the intestine. This response is absent or diminished in calves that have ingested ade quate amounts of colostrum with specific antibodies to the viruses. Most of the efficacy trials with the vaccine were performed on colostrumdeprived gnotobiotic calves that were vaccinated orally at birth and experi mentally challenged a few days after birth.

Vaccination of ewes can result in an elevation of specific colostral antibody and prolong the period over which the antibody is present in the lumen of the intestines of the lambs. The vaccination of cows with a monovalent vaccine results in a heterotypic response to all serotypes of rotavirus to which the animals have been previously exposed, which suggests that single serotype vaccina tion may be sufficient.",

Areas of low inci dence are protected by natural barriers to insect migration. These observations pro mote the importance of biting insects in the spread of the disease both locally and from infected to clean areas. In enzootic areas there is a much higher risk for dairies in forest land, the presence of sandflies, and a higher risk for clinical disease in older cows and cows in lactation.",

However, the shedding of oocysts has been observed to be higher in calves with low absorptive efficiency of IgG from colostrum and low serum IgG concentrations. Case-fatality rates in cryptosporidiosis are usually low and the disease selflimiting, unless there are other complicating factors. In addition to concurrent infections, these include deficits linked to an inadequate intake of colostrum and milk and chilling from adverse weather conditions. Age related resistance, unrelated to prior expo sure, has been observed in lambs but not calves. Infection may result in a serum anti body response, but both cellmediated and humoral responses are important in immu nity against cryptosporidia.",

The disease is usually selflimiting, with symptoms normally lasting between 3 and 12 days. In immunologically compromised persons, clinical disease may be severe. This is particularly serious in human patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed. The infection can be transmitted from person to person, but direct infection from animals and indirect waterborne infection from surface water and drinking water contaminated by domestic or wild animal feces can also be significant.

Cryptosporidi osis is one of a number of zoonotic infections that have recently emerged in these settings. The apparent increase in prevalence of these infections might be caused by the general movement of populations from rural to urban communities and the consequent removal from early exposure to farm animalderived zoonotic agents. Similarly, it could result from better detection and reporting by public health authorities. Regardless, the risk of transmission of zoonotic agents associated with petting zoos, farm animal exhibits, fairs, etc., is real and veterinarians are increasingly asked for advice on this issue. This can be in association with an official capacity as a fair veterinarian or in consultation with farm owners, who desire to bridge the increasing estrangement of urban populations to farm activities.

Each motile sporozoite migrates, by gliding motility, along the exterior surface of the epithelial cells of the gut (e.g., microvilli in the small intestine) and penetrates the cell, eliciting an invagination in the cell membrane (of enterocytes in the small intestine) and forming a bilayered membranous vacuole (outer layer is host derived; inner layer is parasite derived, parasitophorous vacuolar membrane [PVM]). The hostderived outer layer of the vacuole disintegrates, and the inner PVM thickens and acts as the interface between the developing parasite and the host cytoplasm, which results in the parasite being located intracellularly but external to the cell cytoplasm (i.e., extracytoplasmic).

Each merozoite infects a new enterocyte, then rep licates and develops into new type 1 meronts to repeat the cycle, or enters into the repro ductive phase to replicate and develop into a type 2 meront, each of which contains four merozoites. After entering a host cell, each type 2 merozoite initiates the sexual cycle (gametogony) and eventually develops either into a microgamont (containing 12-16 microgametes) or a macrogamont (maturing into a macrogamete). Microgametes (male) are released and fertilize macrogametes (female) to form zygotes. The zygote then develops, within the PVM into an oocyst. In another asexual reproductive phase (spo rogony), the oocyst sporulates to produce, internally, four naked sporozoites. Two types of oocyst are produced and slough off the epithelial layer. The thinwalled oocysts (~20% of the overall population of oocysts) remain in the alimentary tract and have the ability to sustain an autoinfection, whereas the thickwalled oocysts (~80%) are passed in the feces. The thinwalled oocysts are of particular relevance in immunocompro mised, immunodeficient, or immunosup pressed individuals, as the likely cause of chronic cryptosporidiosis.

Halofuginone lactate (HFL) has been used as a supportive measure to treat ment of clinical cryptosporidiosis in calves. Studies have indicated that administering HFL to infected calves at a dosage of 60 to 125 \u00b5g/kg BW (e.g., for 7 days from 1 day of age) decreased the severity of clinical disease as well as oocyst numbers in feces shortly after treatment. Other studies have provided further support of these findings, indicating that HFL is an effective chemo therapy in calves for the purpose of reducing the severity of bovine cryptosporidiosis, and suggesting that HFL decreases the spread of Cryptosporidium from animal to animal because of decreased fecal oocyst output. However, although HFL may be useful in diminishing the severity of disease symp toms, this drug delays rather than eliminates the excretion of oocysts in feces.

Infection occurs most often when weaned calves are fed on the ground, result ing in continuous fecal contamination of the feed. The prevalence of infection in calves in the northwestern and midwestern part of the United States is highest in summer, fall, and spring compared with midwinter (January) and early summer (June). In Canada, for example, winter coccidiosis occurs in beef calves 6 to 10 months of age, most commonly following a prolonged cold period or a sudden change from a moderate winter to severely cold temperature. Cold weather may act as a stressor to precipitate clinical disease in animals previously infected. Acute coccidiosis and a marked increase in the numbers of oocysts dis charged will occur following the treatment of infected calves with a corticosteroid on the 20th day after infection, when clinical signs are apparent, or from the 12th to 15th day after infection. Occasional outbreaks occur in nursing beef calves on pasture when they mingle near water supplies. Postweaning coccidiosis occurs in beef calves grazing on pastures in the subcoastal, dry tropics (e.g., northern Queensland, Australia). It may be more severe in dry years, suggesting that oocyst challenge is less important than immuno suppressive effect of weaning and dietary stress in precipitating clinical disease. Calves are usually weaned and yarded for 3 weeks and then turned out to graze. Severe E. zuernii coccidiosis causing diarrhea, dysen tery, weight loss, and death occurs with up to 10% of calves clinically affected. The disease is most severe in hot, dry, and sunny conditions when, despite heavy fecal con tamination, the yard conditions remain dry and dusty, and oocysts are difficult to find. Coccidiosis caused by E. alabamensis along with other species is a common cause of diarrhea and unthriftiness in calves 2 to 4 months of age within the first few weeks after being placed on permanent pasture in the spring.",

In this situation, lambs spend the first few weeks of their life indoors and have little exposure to infective oocysts, and little or no immunity is acquired. When the lambs are turned out on to pas tures grazed by sheep in the previous grazing season, they rapidly become infected with overwintered oocysts. Coccidiosis develops in such nonimmune lambs 2 to 3 weeks later. The immunity induced by the first infection seems to protect most lambs from reinfec tions later in the grazing season. If lambs are treated with sulfadimidine at 200 mg/kg BW on days 12, 13, and 14 after turnout, then a marked reduction in the severity of the coc cidial infections is seen.",

Early subclinical infection improves the resistance of lambs to later chal lenge. When lambs receive a relatively large inoculum of oocysts during their first week of life, they are relatively resistant to the patho genic effects of some coccidia, are able to respond immunologically, and seem to be protected from subsequent challenges. This information suggests that early exposure or infection of lambs with coccidia, before they are susceptible to the parasites' pathogenic effects, may assist in reducing the incidence, prevalence, and severity of subsequent coc cidiosis. In calves, resistance to E. zuernii infection can occur after chemotherapy, or experimental infection, with monensin or amprolium. Both drugs suppress the develop ment of disease, during which time immunity can develop. An effective immunity develops in piglets following natural or experimental infection with I. suis, which appears to be the most immunogenic coccidial parasite of pigs. Susceptible piglets are infected by this species from infected older pigs. Piglets develop a disease that is more severe when infected with I. suis at 1 to 3 days of age than when infected at 2 weeks of age. 3",

Unsporulated oocysts are passed in the feces from an infected host and develop into the infective stage (sporulated oocysts) in the environment. The original single cell of Eimeria divides, forming four sporoblasts, each of which develops into one sporocyst, and within each sporocyst two sporozoites develop (1 : 4 : 2 configuration of the oocyst for Eimeria). When ingested, the wall of the oocyst breaks down, and sporocysts and spo rozoites are released. The sporozoites then enter epithelial cells. Once within the cells, the sporozoites transform to merozoites, which then undergo asexual replication (schizogony or merogony) and produce first-generation schizonts, which contain many merozoites. After the schizont matures, the merozoites are released by rupture of the epithelial cell. New epithelial cells are again invaded, and second-generation and thirdgeneration schizogony occur. The second generation and/or thirdgeneration schizonts (depending on Eimeria species) are deeper in the mucosa than firstgeneration schizonts and usually lead to the sloughing of the epi thelium, associated hemorrhage, and tissue destruction; therefore these schizonts cause pathogenic effects and lead to enteritis (bloody in severe infections) and clinical disease, but also induce immunity. Following schizogony, the final merozoites that are released invade epithelial cells and \"switch\" to produce sexual stages, called the macrogametocyte (female) and the microgametocyte (male) during the phase of gametogony. The microgametocyte eventually produces microgametes, which fertilize macrogametes (from microgametocyte; within the mucosa) to produce zygotes. These zygotes become oocysts, which slough from the epithelium and are excreted in the feces. The sloughing of the epithelial layer during gametogony can also lead to bleeding.

Exfoliation of the mucosa causes diarrhea, and in severe cases, hemor rhage into the intestinal lumen, and the resul tant hemorrhagic anemia may be fatal. If the animal survives this stage, the life cycle of the coccidia terminates without further damage, and the intestinal mucosa will regenerate and return to normal.

The adult worms are long (females are 20-40 cm and males are 15-25 cm in length), cylindrical, and pointed at both ends and have a thick, glistening, yellowwhite cuticle. They live in the small intestine and lay very large numbers (0.5-2 million eggs per day) of thickshelled eggs. 4 These are not infective until a larva has developed inside. This process needs suitable warmth and humidity and takes place over a period of several weeks. When swallowed, infective eggs hatch quickly in the intestine of the host and the larvae migrate through the intestinal wall, reach the portal vein, and are transported to the liver. They cross to the hepatic venous system and travel to the lungs, are passed up the bronchi and trachea to the pharynx, and are swallowed and come to rest in the intes tine where they mature. The prepatent period (time from infestation to the appearance of eggs in the feces) is 6 to 8 weeks for A. suum and 11 to 15 weeks for P. equorum. T. vitulorum has a more complex life cycle. When eggs are ingested by cattle or buffalo more than 4 to 5 months of age, the larvae settle in somatic tissues without devel oping or growing instead of traveling to the intestine. Subsequently they become acti vated around calving and migrate to the udder. They transfer to the calf in the colos trum and grow to the adult stage in the intes tine over a period of 3 to 4 weeks and produce large numbers of eggs for about 4 weeks. 1 After 8 weeks of infection, the worm counts in the infected calf decline because of strengthened host immunity. 1 Although the eggs in the environment are resistant to drying and freezing, exposure to sunlight will kill them within a few weeks. 4 Protective immunity develops and con sequently only the young are seriously affected. Ascarid worms are very immuno genic and induce strong Th2 immune responses characterized by eosinophilia and high levels of antiinflammatory cytokines, resulting in worm expulsion. 5 However, this strong Th2 induction may inhibit Th1 responses against bacterial and viral infec tions, reducing the efficacy of vaccinations. 6, 7 Under field conditions, eggs are passed by foals from 12 to 13 weeks of age and sponta neous expulsion of worms occurs 6 to 9 weeks later. Eggs are seen occasionally in the feces of very young foals, but this is thought to be from the ingestion of uninfective eggs during coprophagia. In older animals no clinical signs are observed but infested animals, particularly adult sows and yearling horses, continue to contaminate their sur roundings and are an important link in the chain of infection.",

Options for control by grazing management are limited. Alternate or mixed grazing with ruminants can reduce pasture infectivity, as horse strongyles will not establish in these hosts. The stomach worm T. axei, however, is a shared parasite. Removal of all horse feces from fields twice weekly is highly effec tive provided heavy rainfall does not disperse the material. This approach can be cost effective where valuable animals are at risk or labor is relatively inexpensive. Tractor mounted mechanical devices are available for this purpose. A further benefit of fecal removal is that the area within the field grazed by the horses is enlarged, i.e., the ratio of lawn to rough increases.

Thus the alimentary tract wall, liver, kidney, spleen, and lung are most susceptible to the general depression of metabolic activity and development of clinical signs. Gastro intestinal tract lesions produce the most obvious clinical signs because of the exten sive damage to capillaries causing increased permeability and exudation of serum into tissue spaces. The mucosa lifts from the underlying muscle coat and is shed with a resultant loss of large quantities of body fluids. Arsenic does not precipitate protein, and there is no direct local effect on alimen tary tract mucosa; this is indicated by the fact that the parenteral injection of arsenic pro duces lesions in the gut wall, which are iden tical with those associated with ingestion.",

Cattle, horses, sheep, and goats have all become symptomatic or died shortly after exposure. 1,2 Death occurs most often when livestock or horses have access to clippings thrown into their pastures or drylots. Differ ent grayanotoxin isoforms do not degrade in a similar manner during composting but are not expected to be a risk to animals coming into contact with the waste. 5 Humans are exposed by ingesting honey produced by bees obtaining nectar from rhododendrons (mad honey disease), herbal teas, and other natural products. 1 The toxins interfere with the function of voltagegated sodium channels resulting in a continuous state of cell membrane depolar ization. 1, 2 Clinical signs are related to the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, nervous, and respiratory systems. Signs generally begin within 3 to 14 hours after the plant or clippings are eaten and include dullness, sali vation, projectile vomiting, bloat, repeated swallowing or belching, tenesmus, abdomi nal pain, a staggering gait, recumbency, con vulsions with opisthotonus, tremor, dyspnea, and groaning and bleating. Tachycardia, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias occur in some cases. Aspiration pneumonia is a common sequel and is the only common gross necropsy finding. Histopathological changes are limited to minor lesions in the gray matter of the spinal cord. Horses, pigs, and cattle may be poisoned by S. occidentalis seeds that contaminate pre pared rations. 6 All of these plants are associ ated with severe gastroenteritis manifested by diarrhea, often with transitory signs of abdominal pain if the dose is large. Liver damage is a common lesion in experimental and field cases and may dominate the nec ropsy findings. 6, 7 Smaller doses of Senna spp. over a period of a week are associated with necrosis of striated muscle fibers character ized by limb weakness, incoordination, drag ging the hind toe tips, and eventually paralysis in sternal or lateral recumbency. Necropsy lesions are cardiac and skeletal muscle necro sis, but these have not been shown to be direct effects of anthraquinones.",

Mortalities are likely when cattle graze dense patches of C. autumnale in pasture or are fed hay containing the plant. Excretion is primarily through the bile with extensive enterohepatic recirculation; a small percentage (10%-30% in humans) is excreted unchanged in the urine. The toxin is excreted in the milk for an unspecified time period. 8 Confirmation of colchicine in the serum, urine, or milk can be made with several laboratory methods; liquid chroma tography/mass spectrometry is the most current. 2, 8 Treatment is limited as sudden death is the normal result, but would include multiple doses of activated charcoal and intravenous fluid and electrolyte therapy.

In the stomach of the horse, they occur in the cardiac portion and may cause obscure indigestion syn dromes, lack of appetite, weight loss, anemia, obstruction of the lower esophagus, dyspha gia, colic, and occasionally chronic diarrhea. Also, a tumor may ulcerate to terminate with perforation of the stomach wall and the development of peritonitis. Metastases may spread to abdominal and thoracic cavities with an accumulation of fluid. Subcutaneous edema is a common accompanying sign. There may also be pleural effusion caused by metastases in the pleura. Metastases in the female genital tract have also been noted. Most affected animals are euthanized because of anorexia and chronic weight loss. Large masses of metastatic tumor tissue may be palpable on rectal examination. In such cases an examination of paracentesis fluid sample cells should be valuable. Lymphoma in horses is classified into multicentric, alimentary, mediastinal, cuta neous, and solitary tumors of extranodal sites. The alimentary form accounts for approximately 19% of the equine lymphoma cases and is often manifested by chronic diarrhea caused by massive infiltration of the intestinal wall. 1 There is severe weight loss, even in the absence of diarrhea in some cases, usually a large appetite and often severe ascites, and anasarca and sometimes colic. The same signs are recorded in a case of mesothelioma in a horse. The oral glucose absorption test is abnormal with a poor absorption response. Rectal examina tion may reveal large masses of hard nodular tissue, and hematological examination may be of assistance in diagnosis. Pseudodiver ticula or intestinal obstruction may develop in the small intestine associated with tumor tissue. 2, 3 Paracentesis and examination of cells in the fluid for the presence of mitotic figures is an essential part of an examination in suspected cases of neoplasia in the abdom inal cavity. Nasal fibrogastroscopy is an obvious technique for visualizing proximally located tumors but is limited because stan dard instruments are usually not long enough. The course of this disease in horses is quite variable, with the period of illness lasting from 3 weeks to 3 months.",

It is also plausible that early preg nancy diagnosis by palpating the amniotic sac before 40 days of gestation may be a con tributing factor, but it is not essential for all cases. Intestinal atresia can be produced experimentally by terminating the mesen teric blood supply to some parts of the intes tine during development.",

            "text": "In atresia coli, the abdomen may be grossly distended before birth when the defect is in the small intestine, and the dis tension may interfere with normal parturi tion. In defects of the large intestine, distension usually occurs after birth. In these the anus is normal, and the part of the intes tine caudal to the obstructed section may be normal or absent. The principal clinical find ings are depression, anorexia, and abdominal distension. Frequently the owner has not seen the calf pass meconium or feces. Thick mucus may be passed through the anus if it is patent or through the vagina in heifers with concomitant rectovaginal fistula. In many cases the animal has not sucked since the first day, and 5 to 6dayold animals are very weak and recumbent. The intestine may rupture and acute diffuse peritonitis develop. Intestinal segmental atresia has been pro duced experimentally by occluding the blood supply to the intestine in fetal lambs. In one large series of congenital defects in calves the most common site of atresia was the midpor tion of the spiral loop of colon. The passage of a rectal tube or the infusion of barium and radiography may assist in the detection of atresia of the intestine, but care must be exer cised during this procedure or the rectum and descending colon may be perforated. There are usually large quantities of thick tenacious mucus in the rectum with no evi dence of meconium or feces. In the latter case only exploratory laparotomy can reveal the extent and nature of the defect. The dif ferential diagnosis of atresia coli in calves includes acute intestinal obstructions such as volvulus and intussusception, diffuse perito nitis, and septicemia. The presence of feces in the rectum rules out the presence of atresia coli.",

Both melanocytes and myenteric ganglia cells are of neural crest origin, and their failure to migrate from the neural crest results in the absence of melanocytes in the skin and aganglionosis of the intestine. 1 Over 94% of frame overo, highly white calico overo, and frame blend overo horse are heterozygotes, whereas fewer than 20% of tobiano, sabino, minimally blend overo, and breedingstock solid are carriers. 1 Many solid (nonwhite coatcolor pattern) horses with Paint horse bloodlines are heterozy gous; therefore the genotype cannot neces sarily be inferred from coatcolor patterns. 1 White coat color can result from other genetic conformations and is not invariably associated with lethal white syndrome. Some affected foals may have flecks of black hair in the mane and tail or a small black body spot. 1 Affected foals and lambs die within hours to several days of birth. Affected foals are all white or nearly all white and die of colic shortly after birth because of functional intestinal obstruction. Rectal examination reveals a lack of meconium. Radiographic examination of the abdomen reveals a dis tended large colon. Diagnosis is based on characteristic coat color and confirmation of megacolon. Diagnostic testing for the caus ative mutation is available commercially. Control is by testing and detection of hetero zygotes and implementation of appropriate breeding programs.",

If unavailable, oropharyngeal fluid from cattle or throat swabs from pigs may be submitted. Samples should be placed in containers with Trisbuffered tryptose broth with phenol red at pH 7.6. Glycerophosphate buffer, pH 7.2-7.6, can be used for specimens intended for CF. 1 Samples need to be kept refrigerated for shipping for up to 48 hours or otherwise frozen. The indirect sandwich ELISA (IS ELISA) is currently the diagnostic method of choice for identification of viral serotypes of VSV and other causative agents of vesicular diseases. Virus isolation can also be per formed by inoculation into Vero cell cultures and subsequent staining with antiVSV FA conjugate. CF is less sensitive than the ISELISA and is affected by procomplemen tary or anticomplementary factors. 1 Nucleic acid recognition by PCR has been used to detect presence of viral DNA.Serologic tests include VN, CF, and a LP ELISA, all of which are prescribed tests for international trade. LPELISA is currently considered the method of choice for the detection and quantification of antibodies against different VSV serogroups. The ELISA has advantages in speed and expense and has comparable specificity and gives fewer false negative results than VN.1",

The presence of large numbers of oocysts supports the diagnosis, and necropsy findings are usually characteristic.

Large numbers (10 5 /g) of oocysts may occur in the feces of asymptomatic lambs; thus the observation of large numbers of oocysts in the feces of lambs affected with diarrhea and/or dysentery may not, in itself, constitute a diagnosis of coccidiosis.

Cattle/buffalo: Prophylactic anthelmintic treatment of 10-to 16-day-old calvesIn pigs and horses the only route of infection is by ingestion of larvated eggs. Because the eggs have very thick walls the infective stage is protected from deleterious environmental influences. Few disinfectants will harm them, and they are very resistant to cold but survive most readily in cool, moist sur roundings. Periods of survival of up to 5 years have been recorded. In the UK, A. suum eggs shed from September to May, become infective more or less synchronously in July, and the number of eggs becoming infective then falls away rapidly. This coin cides with the prevalence of damaged livers recorded at bacon factories. Transmission is therefore seasonal but as ascarid eggs are very resistant and can overwinter, pigs and horses may in the absence of good hygiene become infected at all periods of the year. Clinical ascariasis is usually associated with conditions that allow infective eggs to accu mulate. This may happen where, for example, the stocking rate is high and the same pad docks are used year after year, or when indoor pens are inadequately cleaned.",

Most tumors of the peritoneum occur by metastasis from adjacent organs, such as with gastric squamous cell carcinoma, or dis seminated disease such as lymphosarcoma. Primary tumors include leiomyomatosis and mesothelioma. Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis has been reported to occur in a mature Quarter Horse. Clinical findings included inappetence, weight loss, intermittent fever, chronic abdominal pain, and enlargement of the abdomen. Rectal examination revealed a prominent, firm, smoothwalled mass in the ventral aspect of the abdomen. Transabdom inal ultrasonography was used to detect the mass, which was a friable, polycystic struc ture occupying a large portion of the abdom inal cavity and weighing 34 kg. The mass was removed and recovery was complete.Mesothelioma has been reported in cattle and goats, 1 predominantly in the peritoneal cavity, but mesothelioma can also occur in the pleural cavity and the vagina of adult cattle. The cause of mesothelioma in cattle is unknown, but pleural mesothelioma in humans is associated with asbestos exposure. One report suggested that the frequency of diagnosis in cattle is increasing. All ages of cattle can be affected with peritoneal meso thelioma, but affected animals are typically young, with fetal and neonatal cases also being reported. Calves and adult cattle most frequently present with moderate abdominal distension. Other presenting signs include scrotal edema in intact males and ventral pitting edema. Occasionally, small 2 to 20mm, welldemarcated \"bumps\" can be felt on all serosal surfaces during palpation per rectum in adult cattle. Peritoneal fluid is easily obtained by ventral abdominal para centesis and has the characteristics of a modified transudate with a moderate to marked increase in phagocytically active mesothelial cells. Definitive diagnosis is made during a rightsided exploratory lapa rotomy, in which numerous raised, white, and welldemarcated masses are palpated on all serosal surfaces, with copious abdominal fluid present. Biopsy of these masses and microscopic examination confirms the pre sumptive diagnosis of mesothelioma. Exten sive peritoneal mesothelioma is fatal and there is no known treatment. All cases reported have been sporadic, and there is no apparent association with asbestos or other toxic agent in cattle. ",

Abdominal distension in utero occasionally causes dystocia. Surgical repair is possible in some cases, but in others a large segment of rectum is missing, and creation of a colonic fistula in the inguinal region is necessary. The condition is thought to be inherited in pigs and calves, but supporting evidence is slim, and the evidence is less clear still in sheep.

A calf with atresia ani and diphal lus and separate scrota has been described. Inherited atresia coli, with complete closure of the ascending colon at the pelvic flexure, has been recorded in Percheron horses.
