The model is parametrised only by the average incubation period, \u03c4, and two rate parameters: contact rate, r C , and exclusion rate, r E . The rates can be manipulated by non-therapeutic interventions and determine the basic reproduction number, R = r C /r E , and, together with \u03c4, the daily multiplication coefficient at the early exponential phase, \u03b2. Initial \u03b2 determines the reduction of r C required to contain epidemic spread. In the long-term, we consider a scenario based on typical social behaviours, in which r C first decreases in response to a surge of daily new cases, forcing people to self-isolate, and then slowly increases when people gradually accept higher risk. Consequently, initial abrupt epidemic spread is followed by a plateau and slow regression. This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, will grant time to develop, produce, and distribute a vaccine, or at least limit daily cases to a manageable number.",

            "text": "On the 11 th of March, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. The rapidly spreading disease is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, transmitted between people via respiratory droplets. Typical symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In severe cases, infection leads to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. The virus was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The disease had spread widely over the province of Hubei, but was contained after strict quarantine imposed on January 23, 2020. The peak of daily confirmed cases of about 4000 was reached on February 3, ten days after the quarantine had been imposed; then the number of daily new cases decreased below 100 at the beginning of March. Currently (as of March 20, 2020), despite some efforts, nearly exponential growth with more than 20 000 cumulative cases is observed in Italy (nearly 50 000 cumulative cases), Spain, Germany, and the US. In contrast, South Korea, that reported less than 10 000 cumulative cases, appears to have exited the exponential phase.",

The model has only 3 parameters: average incubation period (known to be approximately 5 days [1, 2] ) and two parameters that can be modified by applying non-pharmaceutical protective measures: the infectious-susceptible contact rate, r C , and the exclusion rate, r E . Quarantine reduces r C , while testing increases the rate at which infectious individuals are hospitalised or isolated, r E . These two rates determine the basic reproduction number, R = r C /r E . The model is applied to estimate the fold change of r C required to contain the epidemic at its early stage. Since early containment seems implausible, we use the model to put forward longerterm scenarios, in which we assume time-dependent r C reflecting typical social behaviours rather than the impact of government-mandated restrictions that appear to be ineffective in European countries.",

            "text": "We consider a deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded (SIIE) model shown in figure 1. Our model is similar to a commonly used SIR model extension, SEIR [3, 4] ; key differences and their consequences are explained in Discussion. We assume that an individual can be in one of the following states: susceptible (S), infected (i 1 , . . . , i 5 ), infectious (I), or excluded (E). Susceptible individuals get infected by contact with infectious individuals at the rate proportional to the contact rate, r C . Multiple infected states are introduced to account for the average incubation period, \u03c4. With Figure 1 . Scheme of the model with notation guide and default parameter values. The incubation period, resulting from inclusion of k = 5 intermediate infected states, follows the Erlang distribution with average \u03c4 = 5 days, in agreement with data [1, 2] . The serial interval follows the hypoexponential distribution with rate parameters \u03bb = {5/\u03c4, 5/\u03c4, 5/\u03c4, 5/\u03c4, 5/\u03c4, r E }. The model is fully characterized by three parameters: r C , r E , and \u03c4. k = 5 infected states such representation is equivalent to the assumption that the incubation period is distributed according to the Erlang distribution with k = 5 and the rate parameter \u03bb = k/\u03c4 = 1/day. Infectious individuals may become excluded with the exclusion rate r E . As a consequence, the serial interval is distributed according to the hypoexponential distribution that is a series of k = 5 exponential distributions, each originating from one step of the incubation process, having mean times \u03c4/k = 1 day, and one exponential distribution, originating from the \"exclusion\" process, with mean time 1/r E = 3 days. The serial interval distribution implicated by the model agrees perfectly with the distribution obtained from epidemic data (see figure 2B in Ref. [5] ). Excluded individuals comprise the confirmed cases currently handled by the healthcare, those recovered with acquired resistance, and the deceased. Excluded individuals cannot infect. We assume that excluded individuals maintain resistance to the disease. The dynamics is governed by a system of 8 ordinary differential equations provided as equations (8a-8e) and analysed in Methods.",

We use equation (1) to calculate the dependence of \u03b2 = exp(\u03b1) on r C , r E , and \u03c4 (supplementary figure S1). Either a decrease of the contact rate r C or increase of the exclusion rate r E may result in reduction of \u03b2 below 1 and containment of the epidemic. Practically, r C is reduced by quarantine or isolation of individuals, which both lower the potential number of contacts per individual per day, while r E is increased by performing more diagnostic tests, which reduces the expected time during which an infected individual may infect others. Coefficient \u03b2 decreases also with increasing \u03c4 (supplementary figure S1C), but this parameter is not controllable by protective measures.",

A decrease of the contact rate, that can be achieved by imposing quarantine, results in a decrease of the daily multiplication coefficient \u03b2 that describes growth of the cumulative as well as the daily new cases in the exponential phase. Coefficient \u03b2 can be reduced also by an increase of the exclusion rate that in turn depends on efficiency of the healthcare. Large exclusion rate is achieved by fast identification and isolation of infectious individuals. However, when the number of cases is very high, achieving large exclusion rate is nearly impossible; in this case, reduction of the contact rate remains the only option.",

Both estimates were based on the SEIR model, which is essentially very similar to our SIIE model. In SEIR model, Susceptible individuals become Exposed, then Infected (which correspond to our infectious), and then Removed (which correspond to our excluded ). The main difference between our model and the SEIR model lies in the fact that instead of a single infected state we have assumed the existence of five intermediate infected states, which is equivalent to assuming that the incubation period is Erlang-distributed with parameters k = 5 and \u03bb = k/\u03c4, while serial interval follows the hypoexponential distribution, in agreement with Li et al. [5] . Importantly, the simplifying assumption that there is only one intermediate state is equivalent to the assumption that the incubation period follows an exponential distribution. A bit surprisingly, this simplification substantially modifies R estimated from \u03b2.

The exponential distribution or even Erlang(k = 2, \u03bb = k/\u03c4) distribution of the incubation period ( figure 4C) is not supported by data [1, 2] , which indicates much narrower distribution isolated from zero, so we think that our estimate of the basic reproduction number is closer to a real value. Data describing epidemic dynamics in China suggest that very strict quarantine and other preventive efforts imposed in the most affected China province, Hubei, [7, 16] allowed to reduce R about 25-fold (which is on par with the estimated reduction of transmissibility of 97-100% [17] ). This allowed the Chinese to reduce coefficient \u03b2 from about 1.4 in the exponential growth phase to about \u03b2 = 0.89 in the regression phase. In Italy, however, in response to the mild restrictions, \u03b2 was reduced from about 1.5 in the early phase to 1.18 observed currently (March 14-20, 2020), which corresponds to the reduction of R from about 12 to 3; thus, further three-fold reduction is necessary to contain the exponential epidemic spread.",

It appears that most of European countries follow the regulations adopted in Italy, which proved to be insufficient to contain the epidemic, and, correspondingly, with a week-to-month delay, follow the Italian trajectory of the cumulative daily new cases.",

            "text": "Of concern is COVID-19 lethality, which in quantitative terms is usually expressed as the case fatality rate, assessed as the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases. This definition, used by WHO, works well in the steady state when the number of active cases remains constant or when historical data of previous epidemics are analysed. However, in the exponential growth phase, the case fatality rate underestimates the real rate of deaths due to the disease. When the average time between the onset of symptoms or positive test and death is m days, the current cumulative number of deaths should be divided by the cumulative number of cases recorded m days before, which is \u03b2 m times lower than the current number. This observation may to some extent explain puzzling large differences between fatality rates across European countries. In Germany, having the lowest fatality rate (among countries with a high number of cases), identification of people by testing at early stage of the disease and high standard of public healthcare may result in large m, which together with high \u03b2 \u2248 1.3 (March 14-20, 2020) may result in a significant underestimation of the case fatality rate. Assuming m between 10 and 14 days, one can find that the case fatality rate may be underestimated by a factor between 1.3 10 and 1.3 14 , that is, 14-40 times. Finally, we should notice that in non-containment scenarios the expected death toll may not be predicted based on the case fatality rate, because a significant number of cases may be asymptomatic (and some individuals could possibly turn out resistant).",

Additionally, keeping the coefficient \u03b2 at such low level requires stringent limitation of personal contacts, while the time to the peak of the epidemic would be about 7 months. One of potential consequences of exceeding the healthcare system capacity is the increase of case fatality rate due to the lack of necessary medical equipment.",

In early phase of the epidemic, the contact rate may be reduced only by forcing people to stay at home; in the latter phase, when the number of daily cases exceeds a threshold, people isolate themselves to reduce the risk. In such scenario the number of daily new cases reaches peak proportional to an assumed \"fear\" threshold and then slowly decreases due to the decreasing fraction of susceptible individuals. Such scenario seems more realistic and, although devastating for both the economy and social life, grants time to develop and administer vaccine. Historical data on 1918-1919 H1N1 influenza pandemic suggest also that this \"fear\" threshold may not be constant in time, because people suffering from prolonged quarantine may tend to accept higher risk. When this \"negligence\" effect is included, one may obtain trajectories for which fast growth is followed by a plateau and then relatively fast decrease of daily cases. A bit surprisingly, this scenario, although not resulting from centrally imposed preventive policies, may be the most plausible non-containment scenario balancing health and economic costs.",
