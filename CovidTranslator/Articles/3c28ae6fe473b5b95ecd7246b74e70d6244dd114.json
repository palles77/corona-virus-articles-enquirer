The large type produces an erect stem, 2-4.5 m tall, c.15 cm in diameter, sparsely branched, producing prominent prop roots. The taste and fl avour quality are the same in both growth forms. The small form is usually cultivated, grown by suckers or by stem cuttings. It is usually grown mixed with various other crops in the home garden, and large plantations do not exist. Harvesting of leaves can start 6 months after planting. Individual leaves are cut for use, leaving a tuft of four to fi ve leaves at the top of the plant, and are marketed fresh. A mixed plantation of fragrant pandan may give approximately 60 kg fresh leaves per harvest or 6 tons/ha per year. It is also an ornamental plant and its leaves can be used for basket weaving.",

An infusion of leaves is taken internally as a sedative in restlessness, and it is also indicated in curing internal infl ammations. It is used in the treatment of weak nerves (neurasthenia), lack of appetite, hair loss and to darken hair and prevent dandruff. In Thailand, pandan leaves are used as a traditional medicine for treating diabetes. The mode of administration is usually as juice or as a concentrated infusion taken with or without the addition of sugar. Locally it is also used as a treatment for wounds, as an antipyretic, to relieve headache and earache, as a laxative for children, for relief from chest pains, in helping women to recuperate after delivery and in reducing stomach spasms (Wongpornchai, 2006; Anon., 2012a) .",

Juice expressed from the leaves is used to impart fl avour and colour to foodstuffs. Pandan leaves release their aroma when sliced, and have a subtle grassy-nutty fl avour, making them suitable for use in pot pourris alongside fl ower petals, especially rose. They are widely used in many Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, India and even in Australia in a variety of dishes, including rice dishes, puddings, beverages and curries. Nasi lemak, nasi kuning and nasi padang are some of the pandan leaf-fl avoured rice dishes widely eaten in Malaysia and Indonesia, and the leaf paste is used in green Thai and Malaysian curries; the fl avour goes very well with coconut milk, glutinous rice, lemon grass, milk, brown sugar and turmeric. In India, pandan leaves, as well as pandan fl owers from the related species Pandanus fascicularis (common screw pine, the Ketaki fl ower), are used to perfume biryani and other rice dishes and also used in spice blends. Pandan leaves are also used as wrappers in South East Asian cooking in order to provide a distinct fl avour to foods. They are wrapped around chicken, pork, fi sh and desserts before grilling, roasting, barbecuing or steaming. The leaves also provide the green colour and fl avour in Indonesian, Thai, Malaysian and Nonya-style rice baked desserts, candies, puddings, soups and coconut milk. In fact, all over South East Asia, the most important culinary application of pandan leaves is in desserts (Anon., 2012a). In Indonesia, pandan leaves are made into ice cream-like concoctions. Pandan leaves are also used in sweet puddings or custards based on sticky rice covered in thick coconut milk (Routray and Rayaguru, 2010) . Indian desserts such as rasagolla, gulab jamun and rasmalai also often contain pandan leaf. Many dishes containing pandan leaf fl avouring can be found on well-known recipe sites, including: coconut pandan rice custard, coconut pandan chiffon cake, pandan fudge cake, Thai pandan chicken, chicken wrapped in pandan leaves, Thai pandan custard, nasi kuning -festive yellow rice, Indonesian rice with pandan, lod-chong nam ka-ti (pandan noodles with coconut milk), buko pandan, pandan waffl e, Thai pandan chicken, pandan coconut muffi ns.",

The term sumac is derived from the Arabic root, summaq, meaning red, referring to the colour of sumac fruit. Sumac belongs to the genus Rhus, found in subtropical and temperate regions throughout the world. Many species are used as a spice, the most important being Sicilian sumac, Rhus coriaria. Other species used include Chinese sumac (Rhus chinensis), smooth sumac (R. glabra), Staghorn sumac (R. typhina), fragrant sumac (R. aromatica), lemonade sumac (R. integrifolia), sugar sumac (R. ovata) and Muller's sumac (R. mulleria) among others. Sumac plants are large shrubs or small trees, reaching a height of 3-10 m, with pinnately compound leaves. They bear greenish white fl owers in dense panicles and red drupaceous fruits (also called sumac bobs), from which the spice is derived. Sumac is an invasive species that has spread over large stretches of land in many areas of the USA, where it has proved diffi cult to eradicate.",

            "text": "Wasabi (Wasabia japonica (Miq.) Matsum; mustard family -Brassicaceae), also known as Japanese horseradish, is a native aromatic herbal spice crop of Japan. The natural distribution of wasabi ranges from Russia's Sakhalin Island, north of Hokkaido (the most northern Japanese island) to Kyushu (the southernmost major Japanese island). However, the Shimane region is the largest area of wasabi production and breeding research in Japan at present. Wasabi is now being grown in many countries in the world, including New Zealand, Taiwan, Korea, Israel, Brazil, Thailand, Columbia and the Vancouver region of Canada and in Oregon, USA. However, Japanese wasabi is still considered as the best quality variety. Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) is a widely used adulterant and substitute for wasabi. The genus Wasabia consists of two species, the cultivated wasabi (W. japonica) and the wild, uncultivated wasabi (W. tenuis). W. japonica is a glabrous, perennial aromatic herb that grows about 45 cm high, producing leaves on long petioles from the crown of the plant. Wasabi crop matures after 18 months when the plants have thickened rhizome. According to some Japanese farmers wasabi has nine well-known cultivars: Mazuma, Daruma, Takai, Shimane, Midori, Sanpoo, Izawa Daruma, Medeka and Hangen (Oates, 2008) . Daruma is the most popular variety, known to grow well under marginal environmental conditions, such as warmer temperatures. For poor quality locations, researchers developed cultivars like Fuji Daruma, Izawa Daruma, Ozawa Daruma and Sanpoo. Wasabi is grown in two ways: in water and in soil. The water-grown type is considered superior and this is known as sawa wasabi; the lower quality land grown wasabi is known as oka wasabi (Oates, 2008; Sultana and Savage, 2008) .",

When the tissue gets damaged or cut or ground, the glucosinolates are acted upon by the enzyme myrosinase. Isothiocynates are the fi nal product of this enzymatic reaction, which is aided by neutral and alkaline conditions. Wasabi contains several types of isothiocynates, and the fl avour quality of wasabi varieties differ depending upon the relative concentration of these compounds.

In order to minimize the loss of volatiles, the rhizome is kept at a 90\u00b0 angle to the grating surface; in this way, the volatile compounds are allowed to develop with minimal dissipation. Commercially wasabi paste is prepared using mincers to fi nely grind the rhizomes and then it is mixed with other ingredients depending on the end use of the paste (Savage, 2012).",

Wasabi is described as having 'a sharp hot taste with pungent smell', but the heat component in wasabi is different from chillies, and the hotness quickly dissipates in the mouth, leaving an extremely pleasant mild vegetable taste, with no burning sensation at all. Wasabi adds aesthetic and culinary appeal to many foods and is considered a staple condiment in the Japanese diet. Recently, it has found widespread appeal in western cuisine due to its ability to change an ordinary dish to an extra special one by improving the taste (with addition of a spicy fl avour). As a result, it is fast becoming a new fl avour for the rest of the world. All the plant parts of wasabi possess same fl avour but vary in the sharpness they deliver' and are, therefore, used for different purposes. Basically, wasabi can be served in three ways. These are as a condiment on the side of a dish, as a spice or herb in a dish and as wasabi fl avour in processed foods. Rhizomes are the most popular tissues used to prepare fresh paste to be placed in a mound on a dish next to sliced raw fi sh (sashimi), spread on the raw fi sh in sushi preparations, or served on a small dish to accompany a bowl of cooked noodles. Sometimes grated wasabi is mixed with other ingredients like soya sauce and vinegar to prepare a dip for use with raw fi sh or other dishes, according to individual's choice. Tofu (soybean curd) is often decorated with grated wasabi. Wasabi petioles and leaves are pickled in sake brine or soya sauce and are popular accompaniments for white rice. Sometimes fresh leaves are used in salads and dried leaves are used to fl avour cheese, salad dressings or crackers. A wasabi wine is sold (mainly as a novelty) in some Japanese specialty stores, as well as a high alcohol content wasabi liqueur.",

This means that the valuable medicinal properties of wasabi do not reach consumers. This adulteration and substitution of genuine wasabi with horseradish has been going on for over six decades and seems likely to continue unless stringent measures are employed to prevent it (Anon., 2009). In 2009, an organization known as the 'World Wasabi Council' (WWC) was formed by wasabi growers and manufacturers with the purpose of addressing this problem. Any genuine products should carry an 'Authentic Wasabi' logo prominently displayed for easy recognition by consumers. The WWC carry out independent scientifi c tests to verify that products carrying this logo do not contain any European horseradish and/or artifi cial colourings.",

Boldo leaves are strongly aromatic, similar to cinnamon or bay leaves and, when used, impart a very agreeable aroma to dishes. They are most useful in fi sh dishes, and can also enrich the taste and fl avour of sauces, mushroom dishes, pickled vegetables and gravies. Boldo leaves contain about 2 % essential oil, which contributes to the fl avour and aroma of this leaf. The main component of the essential oil is ascaridol, a monoterpene peroxide with a disagreeable smell and found only very rarely in plants. The fl avourcontributing compounds are p-cymene, 1,8-cineol and linalool. The leaves also contain alkaloids such as boldine, isoboldine and N-methyllaurotetanine. They are used in herbal teas, and were part of traditional Mayan medicine. Research has verifi ed the various indigenous uses of boldo leaves: in animal studies, they have been shown to stimulate digestion and to have anti-infl ammatory, antioxidant and bile-producing and diuretic properties which are attributed largely to the plant chemical boldine. A US monograph reports that boldo can increase urine output by 50 %, which again validates the plant's traditional use as a diuretic (Taylor, 2004; Katzer, 1998a ). An ethanol extract of the leaf administered to mice was shown to have a liver protective effect, preventing damage from chemical exposure. The extract also relaxes smooth muscle tissue and prolongs intestinal transit.",

Tropeolaceae). Garden cress and water cress belong to the mustard family (Brassicaceae), and nasturtium belongs to the Tropeolaceae family. All three types of cress have similar fl avour qualities and are used in similar ways. Cresses have a spicy aroma and a refreshing peppery, pungent taste. The unique taste and fl avour are due to the presence of isothiocynate derivatives, which are characteristic of plants in the mustard family. The main component of water and garden cresses is gluconasturin, which yields 2-phenylethyl-isothiocyanate. Nasturtium leaves contain glucotropeolin, which on hydrolysis gives benzyl-isothiocyanate. Cresses must be used fresh: they cannot be dried because drying removes the fl avour almost completely. Cresses are used in local traditional medicine as a remedy for cough, cold, asthma, diabetes, anaemia, constipation and also as a body deodorizer. They are also a good source of iodine (Shipard, 2003) . All three cresses are very commonly used in European and American cuisines. In America, they are used for spreads (especially based on cheese) and salads and often served along with bread and butter. Chopped cress leaves are used as toppings on warm dishes like vegetable soups, scrambled eggs and fi sh dishes. In Europe, cress leaves are used in fl avouring vinegar, sauces and soups, particularly in the form of a herb mixture known as mustard cress. This is a mixture of mustard and garden cress seedlings grown together for use (Katzer, 2012c) . The BBC cook book lists 107 recipes using cresses. (Anon., 2011c).",

All aerial plant parts of this herb contain essential oil (0.7 % in the leaves, 2.5 % in the unripe fruits), which is composed of various monoterpenoids (\u03b1-pinene, \u03b1-phellandrene, thymol, myrcene, p-cymene, terpinene, campher, trans-isocarveol) and ascaridole, a monoterpenoid peroxide (Katzer, 2000c; Stuart, 2003) . Its essential oil and its infusion are anthelmintic; the oil is active against intestinal nematodes, and aqueous extract is active against plant nematodes. Methanol extracts are antiinfl ammatory and analgesic and ethanol extracts are used to reduce tumour growth, most likely due to an immunomodulatory effect. Tea made from its dried leaves is patented as a treatment for uterine fi broids (Diroff, 2008) . Diroff (2008) has provided a detailed review on all aspects of epazote, including its medicinal properties and, biological actions. The herb is used fresh in soups, salads, meat dishes, sauces and, most commonly, in bean dishes (such as the famous Mexican refried beans). It is also used in Mexico as herbal tea. The www.food.com site lists 79 recipes using epazote (Anon., 2011d).",

The solvent extract of fi nger root was reported to have antibacterial properties. Cell line screening using HL-60 cancer cell line indicated that the extract also has an anticancer effect, with a compound called bossenbergin A, reported to have the strongest cytotoxic effect. Finger root is used mainly in fi sh curries, vegetable stews and sea food soups (Katzer, 2003a) .

The leaf contains essential oil, the main components of which are \u03b1-pinene, 1,8-cineol, myrcene and limonene. Gale leaves are used like bay and cinnamon leaves: the whole leaf should be steeped in the dish during preparation, and the leaves are removed before serving. Gale leaves impart a very agreeable and pleasant fl avour to boiled vegetable stews and legume dishes, but are less commonly used in meat dishes. Historically, the most important use of gale leaf has been for fl avouring beer.

In one, the predominant component is citral (citral type) and in the other, the main component is citronellal (citronellal type). The former is more common and is the one used for culinary purposes. It is often described as the queen of lemon herbs, because its essential oil contains around 95-97 % citrals, in contrast to lemon peel, which contains only up to 10 % citrals. The oil of lemon myrtle is antifungal, antiseptic, antiviral, calmative and sedative. Its fragrance, together with its medicinal properties, makes it ideal for use in cosmetics, toiletries, incense burners and massage oils. Citral is used extensively as a food fl avouring, but a leaf or two of lemon myrtle is a good substitute. Lemon myrtle is used in cooking and it blends well with macadamia nut oil. The leaves are used fresh, dry, as powder or as encapsulated extracted fl avour. It is used widely in a variety of food products from bread to pasta, in fi sh preparations, as a herbal tea, in milk-based products, creams, cheesecakes; and also in native beer. Lemon myrtle is also a widely grown ornamental and avenue tree (Katzer,1999) .",

Mexican pepper leaf and its young stems are widely used to fl avour various dishes in Mexican cuisine; outside Mexico it is seldom used mainly due to a lack of availability.

For cooking, the dried berries and dried powdered leaf are used; both have a strong woody fragrance, with a black pepper-like taste with a cinnamon-like notes. Tasmanian pepper is initially intensely hot and pungent, so caution is required in its use. It then produces a strange sensation of numbness similar to the effect of Szechuan pepper. The component responsible for this pungency is polygodial, which is a dialdehyde with a bicyclic sesquiterpenoid skeleton. Tasmanian pepper goes well with other aromatic herbs and can be mixed with other spices like coriander, lemon myrtle, wattle seed and salt. In Australia, it is essential for preparing bush food dishes, like emu burgers, kangaroo steaks and so on. The berries are crushed and mixed with oil, and the resulting product is used for marinating meat. The berries are used in fl avoured breads, pastas and pat\u00e9s, mustards and cheeses. In stews or sauces this spice imparts a vibrant red colour which can be very attractive. Tasmanian pepper is now being marketed internationally and is available in many western supermarkets. Dishes using Tasmanian pepper include: salmon with acacia seed and Tasmanian pepper berries, Australasian roast pork, Australasian roast chicken, balmian bugs and whiting, and Tasmanian pepper beef stew (Katzer, 2001a) .",

The leaf contains essential oil, the main components of which are \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, 1,4cineol, fenchone, \u03b1-humulene, \u03b2-caryophyllene and trans-\u03b2-bergamotene. As with Tasmanian pepper, the bicyclic sesquiterpenoid, polygodial, has been found to be responsible for the pungent taste. The pungency imparted by the water pepper is such that it is diffi cult to substitute it with any other spice. However, the use of water pepper is restricted to Japanese cooking and to the cuisine of some areas of South East Asia such as Vietnam. In Japanese cookery, water pepper leaf is widely used in soups, salads, and also for garnishing sushi. Since water pepper does not have a taste or fl avour of its own except pungency, it is used in Japanese cuisine wherever pungency is required without masking the original fl avour and taste of a dish and its ingredients, such as in fi sh recipes and sushi. Certain types of water pepper have very low pungency, and these are used in Japan as a vegetable. Water pepper seeds are also very pungent, and were used once as a substitute for black pepper, but are rarely used today (Katzer, 2000d) .",
