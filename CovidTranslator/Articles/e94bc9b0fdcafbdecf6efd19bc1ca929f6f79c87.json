Genomics and proteomics are helping the identification of host factors as new targets for drug development, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and tomography offer unprecedented, high-resolution images of virus particles. This year, ICAR recognized the need to discuss this revolution with a special session on Recent Technological Advances. How mutagenesis of the human genome may be used to decipher virus entry, or an excellent introductory lecture on cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction were among the highlights of this year's conference. Similarly, how new expertise may be applied to understand and predict the evolution of virus infections further recognized the role of new strategies to address long-standing unresolved questions.",

For transplantation of a solid organ, the provision of an organ by a HCMV-positive donor (D+) to a HCMV-negative recipient (R-) results in the greatest chance of disease, of which viral load above a certain titer is the greatest predictor (the threshold concept). Paul presented the idea of viral peak shiftif a vaccine can shift the time when the peak viral titer occurs, then it can shift the onset of disease, and thus allow time for antiviral therapy to treat the virus before it turns into problematic and sometimes fatal disease.",

Lysis of infected cells prior to shedding?). Paul's final thoughts revolved around the development of anti-HCMV drugs.

The reasons to mask nucleotides are clear: bypassing the phosphorylation step, due to limited metabolism of nucleoside analogues in the cell and efficient delivery of polar nucleotide analogues into the cells.",

Especially challenging, from the chemistry viewpoint, is the design of NDP and NTP prodrugs, for which the specific and selective removal of up to three or four masking groups, respectively, next to the phosphate anhydride bonds had to be achieved. It was expected that nucleophiles (e.g. intracellular water) would attack the phosphorus atom, leading to cleavage of the anhydride bond in fully masked NDPs and NTPs. The key idea of Chris's approach to avoid undesired cleavage was to keep the negative charge on the \u03b1-(for NDPs) or \u03b1and \u03b2-phosphate (for NTPs) moieties, so that a nucleophile would not attack that position, due to electrostatic repulsion. This would lead to increased chemical stability of the phosphate anhydride bonds in the prodrugs of NDP and NTP prodrugs.",

Two different routesphosphoramidite and H-phosphonate chemistrieswere used for the synthesis of target TriPPPro-compounds in good yields. As in the DiPPro-approach, TriPPPro-compounds bear two lipophilic groups at the terminal phosphate moiety (Gollnest et al., 2015 (Gollnest et al., , 2016 . One can easily play with the masking groups, in order to tune lipophilicity and stability of the prodrug molecules. Longer alkyl chains increase the lipophilicity of the molecules, to compensate for the negative charges on the \u03b1and \u03b2-phosphate moieties, and also enhance stability. Enzymatic hydrolysis of TriPPPro-compounds using porcine liver esterase (PLE) showed a selective formation of NTPs (Fig. 1D) . Formation of the triphosphates was furthermore proven in primer-extension assays. Finally, Chris demonstrated several examples of TriPPPro-compounds derived from well-known antiviral agents, such as ddC (zalcitabine), d4T (stavudine), abacavir, and sofosbuvir. For example, the d4TTP-prodrug (stavudine triphosphate prodrug) was shown to release the active metabolite, d4TTP, and exhibited very good anti-HIV activity in TK-deficient cells. In studies in mice, application of a TriPPPro-derivative based on the sofosbuvir nucleoside led to a two-fold increase in the concentration of the corresponding triphosphate in the liver, compared to sofosbuvir.",

Desiree LaBeaud. She began her talk by describing the breadth and attributes of dengue viral (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) infections, which largely impact neglected populations. Of note, vector-borne diseases are estimated to account for 17% of all infectious diseases, with one million deaths per year. They are spreading largely due to the influences of modern life, including significant travel by up to 2 billion people each year, and increased niches that lead to mosquito breeding. These diseases are both endemic and epidemic. There are 65 million cases of dengue per year in Africa, and this year, Kenya is experiencing an outbreak of CHIKV. In Kenya alone, 10-20% of the children are exposed to DENV and CHIKV, though not all develop disease. Desiree noted the tremendous need for antivirals and vaccines to treat and prevent dengue and chikungunya disease as well as continued efforts to increase awareness and reduce breeding grounds for mosquitos.",

The second cohort contains approximately 500 healthy children aged 1-12 years at each study site, visited every 6 months. Since the inception of the study, 5% of cases of fever were due to DENV infection and 3% were due to CHIKV infection. There is a stable source of virus in these communities, and outside of outbreaks, the incidence of disease is equal across all ages. However, during outbreaks the incidence of disease increases with increasing age, probably due to human movement. It was noted that both diseases have long-term effects. Of note, dengue patients are fully recovered at 1 month postinfection, and fare worse with malaria coinfection (Vu et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "Ester Ballana began her lecture by introducing the role of host factors in modulating virus infections, in particular HIV-1. Restriction factors are host antiviral proteins that counteract or 'restrict' viral replication, and are considered a first line of defense against viruses or other incoming pathogens. Sterile-alpha-motif-and-histidine-aspartatedomain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a member of a unique group of restriction factors that limit retroviral replication at distinct stages of the viral life cycle (Ballana and Este, 2015) . HIV-2 Vpx induces degradation of SAMHD1 by targeting it to the proteasome through addition of ubiquitin (Ub), bypassing SAMHD1 viral restriction. SAMHD1 is tightly linked to cell-intrinsic innate immune responses that direct antiviral defenses by triggering interferon (IFN) production and to the regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation (Fig. 2) . Phosphorylation of SAMHD1 by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) is associated with deactivation of the restriction activity on HIV-1 replication in primary lymphoid and myeloid cells (Badia et al., 2016 . Selective CDK4/6 inhibitors impede SAMHD1 phosphorylation, activating SAMHD1 function and blocking HIV-1 replication (Pauls et al., 2014) . SAMHD1 restricts HIV-1 infection at the reverse transcriptase step in non-proliferating cells. The putative restriction mechanisms of SAMHD1 lie in its dNTP-triphosphohydrolase activity, which regulates the intracellular dNTP pool. Ester showed that SAMHD1 is a modulator of nucleotide analogue efficacy, whereas sensitivity to a non-nucleoside inhibitor (nevirapine) or to nucleoside phosphonates (cidofovir and tenofovir) is not affected. However, she also showed that SAMHD1 could either enhance or reduce the antiviral potency of anti-cancer analogues, an effect that was not dependent on the specific nucleotides targeted, but on their capacity to act as substrates or competitors for the catalytic site in SAMHD1 of the natural nucleotides. Additionally, selective CDK inhibitors also modify the antiviral activity of antimetabolites, an activity that is lost in SAMHD1-knockdown cells. She concluded that modulation of SAMHD1 function may constitute a promising target for the improvement of multiple therapies that employ nucleotide analogues or antimetabolites affecting the dNTP pool.",

The mechanisms of injury remain undefined, and it is still not understood why there is so much damage in infants with low levels of virus.

The data indicate that antiviral therapy with anti-inflammatory agents could improve the long-term outcome of infants with congenital HCMV infections. David Kimberlin presented information on infants with symptomatic CMV infections, which are straightforward to diagnose, since clinical manifestations drive the diagnosis, and asymptomatic infections, for which diagnosis is more difficult, and can only be achieved though broad-based screening. HCMV-induced hearing loss may not be present at birth, but can develop by 15 years of age (delayed onset). Data are only available for infants with symptomatic disease, with treatment started in the first month following diagnosis. Long-course ganciclovir (GCV) treatment resulted in a reduction of worsening/abnormal hearing loss; 6 months of therapy is superior to 6 weeks. The main adverse effect, neutropenia, was lessened with the use of valganciclovir, when compared to IV GCV. As additional drugs for the treatment of HCMV are developed, their use as monotherapies or in combination with valganciclovir for the treatment of congenital HCMV appears promising.",

LET is a HCMV DNA terminase inhibitor with EC 50 values against clinical isolates in the range of 0.7 nM-6.1 nM. LET is active against strains with mutations in UL97 and UL54 that confer resistance to DNA polymerase inhibitors.

In this case, atomic analysis of viral capsid proteins bound to the drug allowed identification of a new hydrophobic drug-binding pocket. Data on resistance mutations mapping to the binding pocket revealed by cryo-EM suggested that this newly revealed structure could be a potential target for the development of novel inhibitors. Next, she used respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as an example of structural heterogeneity among viral particles. Electron cryo-tomographic characterization of RSV virions showed highly heterogeneous architectures, either spherical, filamentous, or a combination of both morphologies. Cryo-EM followed by sub-tomogram averaging revealed that different morphologies correlated with local ordering of the glycoprotein spikes, either in pre-fusion or post-fusion conformations (Liljeroos et al., 2013) . To sum up, Sarah discussed the advantages and caveats of cryo-EM technology, highlighting its enormous potential, especially for resolving structures of not very small proteins (up to 0.1 MDa), but also pointing out some still unresolved issues, such as averaging and computational requirements and the need to develop standardized validation methods.",

Jean-Michel Pawlotsky University of Paris-Est, Paris, France Jean-Michel Pawlotsky told the revolutionary story of anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug development, covering all relevant aspects, including the HCV medical burden, milestones of direct acting antiviral (DAA) discovery, the combination paradigm, handling of drug resistance, through the current standard of care in industrialized countries. He did not forget to state that huge efforts are still needed to identify all HCV patients, particularly in low-income countries, and treat them to potentially eliminate this disease worldwide. Currently we are far from achieving this goal \u2026 Chronic HCV infection in the 1990s was a lethal disease in the long term leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in undiagnosed and untreated patients. The first line of therapy, then based on nonspecific interferon-alpha (initially free, then pegylated) combined with ribavirin, was associated with a poor sustained virological response (SVR). But HCV encodes several enzymes and targetable proteins, including the serine protease NS3-4A, the polyfunctional NS5A protein and the NS5B polymerase. Therefore, drugs targeting these viral functions were soon developed and tested in clinic. Jean-Michel reminded us that the path was not without difficulties, and that many early drugs (e.g. BILN-2061, boceprevir, telaprevir) failed at a late stage of clinical evaluation, or were approved, but quickly replaced by better drugs.",

Some countries such as Australia, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and few others are on track with this road map, but many others need to improve their national action plans. So far it is estimated that only around 5% of patients have been treated worldwide. In China, which counts 10 million infected people, 20% have been diagnosed, but only 1-2% have been treated (www. polarisobservatory.org). \"We know how to do it; let's make it happen.\" Percy Knolle gave an excellent state-of-the-art lecture on the mechanisms of immune disfunction in chronic hepatitis B and possible immune therapies. Chronic HBV infection affects 250 million individuals worldwide, for whom the existing prophylactic vaccine is useless and a curative treatment option does not exist. Indeed, currently the sole therapeutic options rely on either peg-IFN\u03b1 or nucleoside analogues, but those options lead to HBsAg loss (called a functional cure) in only 10% of patients. In contrast to hepatitis C, which can be cured with direct-acting antivirals, it is expected that immunotherapy of some sort will be necessary to functionally cure chronic HBV infections.",

This may initially favor viral replication in the absence of primary innate cell-mediated inflammation, and renders possible the induction of T-cell exhaustion/attrition in a few patients (around 10% of immunocompetent adults) in a virologic context of high and persistent replication. In chronically infected patients, there is a long-lasting failure of HBV-specific immune responses that results in persistence. Yet in many patients, HBV infection remains acute and is cleared rapidly by strong and poly-epitopic T-cell responses. This implies that the infection can be defeated by immune responses, and that in chronically infected patients one would have to break the HBVdriven immune subversion to restore full control of the virus. Most therapeutic vaccination strategies have failed to restore immune control of infection (for a list of past and current trials, see Table 1 ).",

The TherVacB strategy, developed with Prof. Ulrike Protzer (Institute for Virology, Munich), relies first on protein priming with HBV surface antigen and core protein to induce neutralizing antibodies and to prime T cells. A boost with an MVA vector encoding various HBV epitopes (not disclosed) is then given, which expands HBV-specific T cells in liver parenchymal secondary/tertiary lymphoid structures called iMATEs (Huang et al., 2013) .",

AAV-HBV launches a persistent infection in mice, which recapitulates the T-cell exhaustion phenotype. In this model, TherVacB induced HbsAg loss, anti-HBs antibody production (anti-HBs seroconversion), and effector HBs-specific intrahepatic CD8 + cells in iM-ATEs. Interestingly, the formation of iMATES was also favored by an \"adjuvantation\" procedure, based on CpG agonists (TLR9 ligand). At a more subcellular level and with an in-depth mechanistic effort, Percy presented unpublished data showing that iMATEs were induced by a TNF\u03b1/TNFR1 signaling pathway, leading to ROS-mediated mitochondria reshaping. If further preclinical validation of the TherVacB strategy is needed, a clinical evaluation of this patented approach is soon David Durantel's lecture summarized current efforts to develop molecules targeting the assembly of the HBV nucleocapsid, thereby preventing the neosynthesis of viral DNA. The core (HBc) is a structural protein that assembles a capsid around the pregenomic RNA, and reverse transcription then takes place to generate relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA). Core assembly modulators (CAMs) inhibit this process and the neosynthesis of rcDNA, similar to the action of nucleoside analogues (NUC). The HBc protein also has other regulatory functions in infected cells. David reminded us that, in cells with high levels of HBV replication, HBc is in the nucleus, where it binds to cccDNA and may contribute to its transcriptional activity or stability. HBc also binds to host DNA and may regulate host gene expression. Finally, as HBc is mainly an RNA-binding protein, it could bind to viral RNAs and regulate their fate. Due to the multifunctional character of HBc, CAMs might do more than initially envisaged.",

SAMHD1, via its dNTPase activity, mediates an anti-HIV-1 activity by reducing the pool of dNTP. It also modulates the activity of antimetabolites such as pemetrexed (Pmtx), which have basal anti-HIV and anti-cancer activity. The dNTPase activity of SAMHD1 is inactivated by phosphorylation. The inhibition of SAMHD1 phosphorylation could therefore lead to more pronounced anti-HIV activity, due to dNTP deprivation. This study elegantly showed that CDK4/6 is involved in the phosphorylation of SAMHD1 and that its inhibition by palbociblib (Pb) prevented SAMHD1 phosphorylation and, in turn, potentiated the anti-HIV activity of Pmtx. Indeed the combination of Pb and Pmtx had an increased effect on HIV-1 replication, as well as an increased anti- cancer effect, with a combination index (CI) < 0.02. Such a combination could prove useful for therapeutic strategies. Maria Pujantell, also of the Irsicaixa AIDS Research Institute in Barcelona, showed experimental evidence that A-to-I editing by the cellular adenosine deaminase, acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), functions as a regulator of innate and antiviral immune function in HCV infection. ADAR1 has been reported as a key step in triggering innate immunity in response to foreign viral RNAs, including HIV-1 . Knockdown of ADAR1 enhanced expression of the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5, phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression and phosphorylation of IRF7, indicative of innate immune activation. Polymorphisms within the ADAR1 gene were found to be significantly associated with the clinical response to interferon therapy and advanced liver fibrosis in a cohort of 155 HCV-and HIV-1 coinfected patients (Pujantell et al., 2018) . They concluded that ADAR1 regulates innate immune signaling and is an important contributor to the outcome of the HCV-host interactions.",

To demonstrate that the small molecules were recruiting the CLR complex to mediate degradation of NS3-4A, the cereblon-binding moiety in DGY-04-35 was modified to produce DGY-07-026, which cannot recruit cereblon and consequently does not mediate NS3-4A degradation. Degradation of NS3-4A could also be prevented by competition with lenalidomide, a cereblon ligand. Together, the experiments demonstrate that the small molecules were recruiting the CLR complex to mediate degradation of NS3-4A and thereby inhibit HCV. Jinhong Chang of the Baruch Blumberg Institute, Doylestown, PA, USA, described novel benzamide compounds that modulate HBV nucleocapsid assembly in a distinct manner compared to other capsid assembly modulators (CAM), which are currently developed as anti-HBV in clinic. Starting from a chemical bank of around 20,000 molecules and using a home-made screening assay based on the AML12HBV10 cell line, they identified 8 novel chemotypes. The newly identified chemotypes also induce the formation of empty capsids, but the latter have a different mobility in an optimized, i.e. slow running, agarose capsid migration assay. Amongst the 8 molecules identified, BA-53038B was further studied. It showed an EC 50 in the sub-\u03bcM range against WT HBV, remained active against F97L, V124A, V124F mutants, but was ineffective against V124W mutant, similar to other CAMs. This was indirect evidence that BA-53038B binds to the HAP pocket, but could induce different conformation change with surface altered charges.

Ebola treatment: working in the dark under the spotlight. Michael Jacobs, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK During the West African Ebola epidemic, he led the team that treated patients at the Royal Free Hospital in London, including a case of encephalomyelitic infection in a nurse who had earlier recovered from Ebola virus disease. Michael Jacobs noted that, in spite of an epidemic lasting nearly three years, with an estimated 28,000 cases, and considerable experience in administering experimental treatments to patients in Africa, the USA and Europe, there are still no therapies with proven efficacy. Part of the difficulty has been disagreement among experts over how experimental medications should ethically be administered and how trials should be designed to provide evidence of efficacy.",

Examination of BDAA-resistant YFV found that the compound interacts with a three-residue motif centered at P219 of the NS4B protein. In addition to direct inhibition of viral replication, RNAseq analysis revealed that BDAA treatment also significantly enhances the levels of mRNAs specifying a broad range of cytokines, chemokines and ISGs.

May and colleagues found that 3.3 competes with cholesterol for binding to the membrane distal domain (D1) of LAMP1: cholesterol strongly enhances the interaction of the viral GP with D1, while 3.3 blocks it.

GCV is converted to its monophosphate (MP) form by the CMV-encoded pUL97 protein kinase, followed by endogenous cellular phosphorylation to the active GCV-TP that inhibits viral DNA synthesis. In contrast, MBX-2168 was previously shown to be partially phosphorylated to the MBX-2168-MP by the cellular kinase TAOK3, allowing MBX-2168 to overcome UL97 resistance. Second, a butyl-ether moiety at the 6-position of the guanine ring must be enzymatically removed. To characterize this step, pentostatin, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and adenosinedeaminase-like-protein-1 (ADAL1), was co-incubated with MBX-2168, which resulted in a reduction in its EC 50 by > 300-fold (0.02 \u03bcM vs. 6.47 \u03bcM). Further, the moiety at the 6-position of the guanine ring of MBX-2168 was not enzymatically removed by ADA, suggesting that it is removed by ADAL-1 following phosphorylation of the drug to a MP. Remarkably, when MBX-2168 was incubated with cellular extracts and an ADAL1-baculovirus construct, conversion of MBX-2168-MP to synguanol-MP was demonstrated, Future research will focus on the conversion of MBX-2168-MP to synguanol-MP by ADAL-1 in the presence and absence of 2-deoxycoformycin (dCF), a potent adenosine deaminase inhibitor, and on the conversion of MBX-2168 to its triphosphate in infected cells.",

Although intranasal challenge of 4-week-old mice with EV-D68 does not cause mortality or weight loss, decreased lung function is observed by plethysmography, with elevated lung virus titers and proinflammatory cytokines. Following STF1019 treatment, only modest antiviral effects were observed, but mice given 100 or 200 mg/kg showed significant decreases in lung titers of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. In the EV-D68 neurological model of infection of 10-day-old mice, treatment with STF1019 did not prevent weight loss, neurological signs or mortality. However, in the EV-71 neurological model, all mice treated with 200 mg/kg were protected from infection. These results demonstrate the utility of the EV-D68 and EV-71 mouse models to evaluate antivirals and the effectiveness of STF1019 as a potential therapy for EV-71 infection.",

Some compounds showed higher selectivity indices than acyclovir, the gold standard for therapy of HSV. Experiments using a dual-color HSV strain expressing GFP in the tegument and red cherry in the capsid (Ivanova et al., 2016) were performed to identify which steps of the viral replication cycle were hindered. Some compounds inhibited nuclear capsid formation or capsid egress into the cytoplasm, while three (PANH_135, 173 and 174) reduced the number of HSV-1 capsids in the cytoplasm and blocked the binding of the Cterminal domain of pUL36 (the large essential tegument protein) to nuclear and cytoplasmic capsids. Time-of-addition studies showed that these compounds are still active when added 24 h after infection. Work is ongoing to elucidate their inhibitory potential for HSV-2, varicella zoster virus, CMV and Kaposi sarcoma HV and to determine the molecular and/or host targets.",

Time-of-addition studies showed that the drug inhibits an early stage of the CMV replicative cycle and affects transcription of immediately-early (IE) genes; the effect is dependent on the multiplicity of infection (MOI). However, inhibition of a late stage of the replicative cycle was found to be independent of the MOI, suggesting a novel mechanism of action.

To characterize this transcriptional heterogeneity, her team performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using the Fluidigm technology and a primary model of HIV latency. They analyzed the transcriptional profile of 224 latently infected CD4+T single cells, divided into three groups: untreated, histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat (SAHA)-treated and TCR-stimulated cells. Principal component analysis identified two different clusters in each of the three groups that correlated with differences in HIV expression: a \"deep\" stage CD4 + T-cell cluster, poorly responsive to external stimuli and difficult to reactivate, and an \"inducible\" stage CD4 + T-cell cluster, which was easier to stimulate and reactivate. They also found a 134-gene specific cellular signature that was associated with the success of HIV reactivation. In vivo analysis of single cells from HIVinfected individuals further confirmed the existence of the two cellular populations, which might reflect two distinct resting cellular states and display a different potential for cell stimulation and HIV reactivation.",

Thanks to Vpx, HIV-2 infects DCs at high levels and activates innate immunity through sensing of DNA by cGAS-cGAMP-STING proteins (Lahaye et al., 2013) . Manel's team was able to package cGAMP into viral particles (VLPs), transmit it into target cells, and induce an immune response. As he highlighted, this has implications for cancer immunotherapy, since cGAMP-VLPs induce anti-tumor T cell responses, and for vaccination, because cGAMP-VLPs could be delivered along with antigen by intramuscular injection, thereby exerting its immunomodulatory role.",

Manel and colleagues demonstrated by different approaches the existence of a nuclear protein that directly binds to the HIV capsid and that it is required for STING-IRF3-mediated interferon induction in response to HIV-2 in DCs.

They were conceived as a strategy to cure HIV infection, by means of the shortterm administration of latency-reversing agents (LRA) that increase HIV-1 transcription, protein expression and plasma RNA. To induce virus reactivation, many pathways may be targeted by LRAs. Vorinostat provided the first direct measurement of the disruption of HIV-1 latency in vivo, with a mean 4.8-fold induction in unspliced cell-associated HIV-RNA that was not accompanied by a rebound of viral particles in plasma (Archin et al., 2012) . The subsequent use of other LRAs such as panobinostat, which induces extracellular HIV-1 RNA and p24 production in plasma, further confirmed that it is possible to induce in vivo reactivation of HIV-1 . However, as Ole highlighted, none of these early trials, even those using potent LRAs such as romidepsin, were able to reduce the size of the latent reservoir, and once ART is interrupted, there is viral rebound. He therefore concluded that \"shock\" exists, but not \"kill\". In the last part of his lecture, he reviewed newer studies that combined LRAs with therapeutic HIV-1 vaccines aimed at improving the killing of reactivated cells, and studies to test LRAs such as TLR7 and TLR9 agonists, which may also enhance antiviral immunity.",
