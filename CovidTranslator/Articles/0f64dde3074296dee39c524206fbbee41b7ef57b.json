I3eginning about 1972, the more severe respiratory form of IBR also became widespread in western European countries (Edwards, 198X; Ackermann et al.. 1990a.h.) .",

About 50000 seropositive animais have been sl~u~ht~re~~ at a cost of about 110000000 Swiss francs (A~kern~~~nn, 1990b) . The cost of lll~int~ining this program is estimated at an ~~dditi~~n~l 5000000 Swiss francs per year. Although appropriate for small countries like Switzerland, it seems unlikely that similar test and slaughter programs would be feasible or cost-effective in countries with much larger cattle herds. Thus. alternative approaches are needed. One such approach now under consideration is that of vaccinating cattle with genetically engineered deletion marker vaccines so as to protect the cattle, and then testing the cattle with differential diagnostic test kits so that infected animals may be distinguished from vaccinated anin?& and culled from the herd (Kit et al., 1990b) . The genedeleted marker vaccine and differential diagnostic test approach has already been used in worldwide pseudorabies control and eradication programs (Kit, S. and Kit, M., 1991) .",

In each plate, two wells were used as blank wells (lacking antigen}, two wells for negative controls (fetal bovine sera lacking IBRV antibodies), and two wells for positive control (sera with IBRV antibodies). Aliquots (0.1 ml) of test sera or of negative and positive control sera were added to appropriate wells of microtiter test plates. A negative serum was added to one blank well and a positive serum to the other blank well. The plates were covered and incubated for 2 h at room temperature (21.--25\"C), the fluid was removed, and the wells were rinsed three times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, I mM EDTA). IBRV anti-g111 monoclonal antibody(G2) --. horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Collins et al., 198411985, 1985) was then added to each well. The plates were covered, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and rinsed live times with wash buffer, with tapping dry between washes. Finally, 0.1 ml of premixed TMB substrate solutions I and II (KPL) were added to all of the wells, the plates were incubated at 21-25\u00b0C for 20 min, and then 0.5 ml of a stop solution containing 0.01% sodium azide was added to each well, and the color was analyzed by reading the absorbance at 650 nm. The absorbance (A) of the blank well (about 0.05) was subtracted from the A readings of the other wells. The antigen and monoclonal antibodyconjugate concentrations were adjusted so that the A values of the negative control (fetal calf sera) were from 1.0 to 1.5. The A values of the positive control (bovine anti-IBRV sera) were about 0.2 to 0.4. Results on test sera were expressed as S/N values, defined as the A of the test sample (S) divided by the A of the negative control (N).",

The IBRV gII1 gly~oprotein used as antigen in the blocking ELISA test is a major component of IBRV particles. IBRV gII1, like the homologous PRV gII1 and HSV gC glycoproteins, has a role in the initial attachment of virus particles to heparin-like receptors on the surface of permissive cells, so that the deletion of gII1 probably delays the replication and spread of IBRV in vivo (Kit, S. and Kit, M, 1991; Liang et al., 1991) .

            "text": "IBRV gII1 is classified as a 'late' protein (Ludwig and Letchworth, 1987) . This and the fact that it is expressed at high levels on the surface of virus particles and on the surface of virus-infected cells, and also the fact that it is a major target for the induction in cattle of high levels of virus neutralizing antigens makes IBRV gII1 an advantageous and reliable marker for a differential diagnostic test (van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk et al., 1990; Hutchings et al., 1990) . The high level of induction of virus-neutralizing antibodies and the importance of gIII for differential diagnostic testing s4 counterbalances any reduction in protection of cattle that might occur through the use of IBRV gIII deletion mutant as vaccines. It may be noted that even in the absence of gIII, several important immunogens capable of inducing protection are available. For example: (i) IBRV glycoproteins gl and gIV, the homologues of the essential HSV glycoproteins gB and gD, respectively, are major antigens involved in the induction of IBRV neutralizing antigens early in infection (Ludwig and Letchworth, 1987) : (ii) IBRV gIV appear to be the antigen which most consistently stimulates the proliferation of lymphocytes from IBRV-immunized animals (Hutching et al., 1990) ; (iii) the activation of natural killer cell activity against IBRV-infected cells does not require late viral glycoproteins, like gII1 (Cook et al.. 1989; Palmer et al., 1990) ; (iv) protective itnmune responses are obtained by injection of individu~~l IBRV glycoproteins g1, gI11, and gIV. with gIV inlInLlni~ation providing the best individual protection (Babiuk et al., 1987 : van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk et al., 1990 and (v) essential glycoprotein gH (Meyer et al., 1991) and other IBRV proteins (e.g. VP8) may contribute to the induction of protective immune responses. In the case of the complex herpes viruses, there is neither theoretical nor empirical evidence that deletion of the nonessential gIII(gC) glycoprotein impairs the protective response (Kit, S. and Kit, M., 1991) .",
