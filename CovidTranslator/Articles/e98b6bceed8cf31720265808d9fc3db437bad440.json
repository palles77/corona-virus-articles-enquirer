            "text": "In considering how to design antiviral drugs, one envisions two broad strategies. Because viruses replicate by using self-encoded proteins or by seizing control of cellular factors, agents designed to interrupt viral replication could, in principle, target with equal effectiveness either a viral or cellular polypeptide 2 . Interestingly, the two strategies hold different implications. In the case of a unique viral function, such as capsid formation, there is a lower risk of creating inhibitors with toxic effects on the host, similar to the advantage antibacterial drugs have in inhibiting bacterial targets that do not exist in their host. In the case of a target such as a viral HELICASE, there is a smaller window for specificity because the viral and cellular enzymes catalyse a similar enzymatic reaction. However, as the viral and cellular enzymes are not identical, traditional medicinal chemistry and structure-based drug design can exploit the difference between host and viral enzymes to create drugs with high specificity for the virus.",

            "text": "The Achilles heel of antiviral therapy is RESISTANCE 3 . Unless a drug is incredibly potent (reducing the size of the replicating pool of virus rapidly), and therefore requires only a short duration of treatment (reducing the time for the resistant viruses to amplify), resistance to treatment will arise over time, as observed with HIV or HBV patients on therapy. Targeting a cellular factor that is required for viral replication should help overcome the problem of viral resistance. Theoretically, the drug could be pan-antiviral and inhibit all viruses that are dependent on the same host factor. Operationally, we define pan-antiviral to mean that the inhibitor targets more than one family of viruses. This latter intervention strategy limits the development of resistant viruses, but it has a major disadvantage in generally causing greater toxicity to the host. Empirically, how one focuses one's antiviral drug design can be influenced by whether the virus replicates largely autonomously of the host, using predominantly virally encoded genes (for example, herpes simplex virus (HSV)), or whether the virus is intimately associated with the host's metabolism (for example, integrated proviruses). In this review, we discuss in a non-exhaustive fashion the HCVencoded helicase NS3, and the cellular helicase DDX3 adopted for use by HIV-1, as two illustrative examples of potential antiviral targets.",

            "text": "At the most basic level, helicases are motor enzymes that use energy derived from NTP hydrolysis to unwind double-stranded nucleic acids [4] [5] [6] [7] . Further classification depends on whether the helicase can bind single-stranded nucleic acid, unwind RNA or DNA or both, and the direction of unwinding (3\u2032 to 5\u2032 or 5\u2032 to 3\u2032), and whether certain signature motifs are present in the primary sequence. Helicases have been divided into three super-families (SF1, SF2 and SF3) and two small families based on sequence comparisons and conserved motifs 8 . Examples of members of SF1, SF2 and SF3 are shown in TABLE 1. FIGURE 1a shows a schematic illustration of the seven highly conserved motifs among the two largest families (SF1 and SF2). Although, as discussed later, the conserved motifs are associated with conserved helicase function, a comparison of the primary sequence of two SF2 helicases (FIG. 1b) , HCV helicase and human DDX3 reveals a paucity of identical residues (highlighted in green) and a tremendous divergence in sequence outside of the conserved motifs (highlighted in red). The differences in primary sequence and tertiary structure between the helicase of a viral pathogen and that of cellular helicases can be exploited to confer specificity to an antiviral inhibitor.",

The total number of domains can vary from four (that is, PcrA/Rep), to three (that is, HCV helicase) to two (that is, elongation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A)). The different domains of a three-domain helicase (HCV helicase) are shown schematically in FIG. 1c, in which domain 1 (magenta), domain 2 (yellow) and domain 3 (cyan) are clearly delineated. Domains 1 and 2 form a core that is conserved in all helicases, and contain most of the conserved sequence motifs at the interface between the two domains, as seen in the example of HCV helicase (FIG. 1d) . Surprisingly, despite widely disparate protein sequences, similar structural elements are conserved in all the structures solved to date. This is illustrated by an overlay of the structures for HCV RNA helicase 10 (red; three domains) and PcrA DNA helicase 11 (cyan; four domains) in FIG. 2a. The position and length of the \u03b1-helices and the number and orientation of \u03b2-strands in the core of both enzymes (top two domains) are very similar. By contrast, a divergence is clearly seen in domain 3 (bottom left) and HCV helicase has no counterpart to domain 4 of PcrA helicase (cyan, bottom right).",

SF2 RNA helicases are also called DEA(D/H)-box helicases after the signature sequence of Walker B motif. As highlighted in orange in FIG. 1b, the residues in the conserved motifs required for binding and hydrolysing NTP lie at the interface between of domains 1 and 2 in HCV helicase. There is considerable flexibility in the distance between the two domains, although NTP hydrolysis can only occur when the domains are in a 'closed' configuration. Additional crystallographic and mutational analyses have identified motifs that contribute to oligonucleotide binding, such as Ia and IV 8 . The TxGx motif spans the bottom of the cleft between domains 1 and 2 and acts as a 'hinge' for the movement of domain 2. The exact changes in physical conformation and the path the RNA or DNA takes as one strand is destabilized and 'unwound' from the other are not well understood, but they do not seem to be conserved between different helicases. Complicating matters further, some helicases seem to function as monomers (for example, HCV helicase), others as dimers (for example, HSV UL5) and yet others as hexamers (for example, simian virus 40 (SV40) T antigen). Many putative helicases have so far only been identified by the presence of a DEAD/H box in the primary sequence and await biochemical verification of bona fide helicase function.",

Although all viruses are thought to functionally need helicase(s), in some cases the larger entities have the luxury of self-encoding such an enzyme, whereas size-constrained, smaller viruses can adapt to use a cellular helicase. In general, RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm mostly self-encode a helicase, whereas those that replicate in the nucleus often utilize a cellular helicase. Consistent with the latter notion, HIV-1 was shown in two recent studies to co-opt the activity of a cellular helicase 27, 31 . Human helicase members of superfamily 2, DDX1 31 and DDX3 are required for the viral Rev protein to export unspliced/partially spliced HIV-1 mRNAs from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. DDX1 or DDX3 can therefore be added to the list of potential treatment targets of HIV-1-encoded enzymes (that is, reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase).",

Optimization of the screening hits resulted in compounds that inhibited HSV growth in cell culture with little cytotoxicity and which were orally active in an animal model of HSV. Mechanistically, the thiazolylphenylcontaining drugs seem to stabilize helicase-primase binding to polynucleotide substrates and halt further catalytic cycles. The mechanism of antiviral action was confirmed when several groups independently selected resistant viruses with single point mutations in the UL5 DNA helicase gene for both classes of compounds, confirming the mechanism of action of the inhibitors. Although the UL5 mutants showed little to no reduction in replicative fitness compared with wild-type virus in cultured cells 44 , the fitness of such mutants in the clinical setting is the most important measure of fitness.

However, at the time there was widespread optimism that the HCV helicase would turn out to be a good target for antiviral drug discovery. Bolstered by the successful examples of anti-HIV drug design, structure-based drug design efforts have focused on finding inhibitors of three essential viral enzymes: the [48] [49] [50] . In the NS3 bifunctional protein the first 181 amino acids form a serine proteinase, whereas the carboxy-terminal 181-631 amino acids form a helicase. From a biological standpoint, protease and helicase activities co-exist in vivo, and either could serve as a useful anti-HCV target. The helicase and polymerase form a complex with other host and viral proteins to create the viral replicase multi-protein complex [51] [52] [53] . In order for HCV to multiply, negative-stranded RNA replicative intermediates must be synthesized by the replicase complex using incoming positive-stranded RNA from the infecting virus as the template. The negative-stranded replicative intermediate is then used as an intermediate template to synthesize positive-stranded progeny RNA, which is packaged into viral capsids. Because the positive and negative RNA strands are complementary, HCV helicase is thought to be required for strand separation. Additional functions in HCV replication might include the melting of highly stable secondary structures, which are known to be present in HCV RNA, in order to increase translational efficiency of the polyprotein or to increase replication rate and fidelity 54, 55 . Currently, very little is known about the crucial protein-protein interactions in HCV, except that the NS4A cofactor interacts with NS3. Microscopic studies indicate that replicase, as well as most of the HCV proteins, congregate on the ER to form a 'membraneous web' . It is thought that cellular factors are probably present in this membrane-associated complex or complexes. Future efforts at mapping protein-protein interactions, both between viral proteins and cellular factors, will be important for successful drug discovery.",

These structural studies support the notion that in the absence of other replicase proteins, the helicase domain can largely function independently of the protease domain and that use of the helicase domain alone could be a reasonable choice for an assay format. However, biochemical studies comparing the helicase activity of the full-length NS3 protein with the truncated helicase domain suggest that the full-length domain is more efficient at unwinding, and subtle differences exist in the mechanism of unwinding for the full-length and truncated domain [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] in the presence and absence of NS4 63 .

An in-depth description can be found in detailed physical and kinetic analyses of periodic cycles of RNA unwinding and pausing by HCV NS3 helicase, which have been investigated by several laboratories 59,64-68 . As schematically shown in FIG. 5a, the conformation of an active helicase can be broadly divided into an 'open' and a 'closed' complex of domains 1 and 2, with a transition between the two. As shown in FIG. 5b, assays can be used to identify small-molecule helicase inhibitors that have the following effects: they inhibit NTPase activity by direct competition with NTP binding 69 ; competitively inhibit nucleic-acid binding; inhibit NTP hydrolysis or NDP release by blocking the movement of domain 2; inhibit the process that couples NTP hydrolysis to translocation and unwinding of nucleic acid; inhibit unwinding by sterically blocking helicase translocation 70 ; and inhibit unwinding (reviewed in REFS 14, 71) . For all these mechanisms, unwinding and binding assays can be deployed.",

As all helicases share some common enzyme reactions (for example, NTP hydrolysis and translocation) in their mechanisms of action, it might be difficult to avoid the possibility of hitting an unintended cellular helicase and generating unwanted side effects. Electrostatic analysis of the HCV helicase shows both active-site and nonactive-site locations 73 that could be exploited for drug design. Although it might be tempting to inhibit oligomerization, inhibition of protein-protein interactions with a small molecule could be difficult because such interactions usually have multiple points of contact over a broad surface area, and blocking one such contact with a small molecule is usually not sufficient to block binding of the two proteins. This kind of mechanism is more suitably targeted by antibodies and antibody mimics. Likewise, targeting additional domains that are unique to a helicase in an attempt to gain specificity -such as the two novel conserved motifs in HCV helicase 74 -is not practical unless a specific assay is available for a function known to be associated with the domain or an approach is used to develop reagents that bind to the region of interest. Recombinant human antibodies 75, 76 and RNA aptamers 77, 78 have been developed that bind to HCV helicase and which inhibit HCV helicase activity.",

Theoretically, an unwinding assay should increase the odds of finding an inhibitor because inhibition of any of the potential mechanisms of action listed above, except those requiring a cellular environment (for example, turnover and replicase-complex formation), should result in 'hits' (for example, low-potency chemical starting points for medicinal chemistry optimization). The choice of a more stable DNA substrate versus the more 'natural' RNA substrate is available for HCV helicase because it can unwind both RNA and DNA homoand heteroduplexes. Biochemical assays for detecting inhibitors of nucleic-acid binding or ATPase activity can be run in HTS mode, but are primarily used to elucidate the mechanism of action of an inhibitor. There is no reason why an unwinding assay could not also find inhibitors that cause conformational changes to the helicase.",

Empirically, in screens for HCV helicase, very few candidates were found; one explanation for this dearth of results could be that non-potent hits simply could not bind with sufficiently high affinity to helicase to inhibit the unwinding reaction. An alternative to an unwinding assay is to identify molecules that simply bind to the helicase and alter its conformation. Accordingly, the strategy is to evolve initial binders that change conformation into tighter binders that can also inhibit unwinding. In scoring for binding and conformational perturbation, one could possibly find more hits than scoring for unwinding. ",

Both compounds decreased HCV viral load in patients by ~2-3 logs in the first 3 days of dosing. In some patients treated with VX-950, the HCV viral load dropped from 10 6 infectious units (IU) per ml at the start of treatment to below the limit of detection (<10 IU per ml) during 14 days of dosing. Several other HCV protease inhibitors from different companies are currently in clinical trials. The speed with which HCV protease inhibitors have approached the clinic is remarkable given that the active site of the enzyme is notorious for being 'flat and featureless'. In addition, most high-throughput protease screens of large compound libraries have not produced good hits. However, it has been possible to use the HCV protease substrate and cleavage products as starting points for structurebased design to create the peptidomimetic inhibitors that are in clinical development today.",

The ATP-binding site has been successfully targeted by kinase and gyrase inhibitors in which the binding site is a distinct and well-defined 'pocket' . By contrast, only weak inhibitors have been found that inhibit the HCV binding site 86 . One explanation might be that the HCV helicase NTP-binding site at the interface of domains 1 and 2 has little specificity -it binds all NTPs primarily through the phosphate, not the base, of the nucleotide. In all helicases, the NTP-binding pocket forms transiently as domain 2 approaches domain 1, a movement that results in hydrolysis of ATP and concomitant opening or separation of domain 2 from domain 1. Most of the crucial residues for helicase activity and the conserved motifs are arrayed on the inside face between domains 1 and 2 in which the potential target-binding sites are only formed transiently when the two domains close. The constant movement of domains 1 and 2 between an 'open' and a 'closed' configuration and back again means that the enzyme is likely to often be in transition 87 . We have yet to understand the necessary principles required to inhibit such a dynamic protein system.",

Domains 1 and 3 are relatively rigid with respect to each other (the traces lie on top of each other), whereas domain 2 has a large freedom of motion. This is indicated in FIG. 6B by the silver ball identifying a single carbon atom in domain 2. Finally, small-molecule drug design requires a reasonable starting point, whether it is a substrate mimic or a hit from screening.

All cells and viruses require a helicase function, not necessarily their own, for nucleic-acid replication. The requirement for long-term treatment regimens for HIV allows for the generation of drug-resistant cellular enzymes, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to treat hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, endothelial dysfunction and renal disease 89 . The potential for off-target-induced cytotoxicity is significant, irrespective of whether one is targeting a cellular or viral helicase, because of similarities in structure and function. However, the recently characterized requirement for a helicase in Rev-dependent HIV-1 gene expression could be a new means to treat HIV-1 without generating drug-resistant viruses. In our laboratory (K.-T.J.), preliminary evidence has been found that ring-expanded nucleoside analogues, previously used successfully as NTPase/helicase inhibitors of West Nile virus 90 , have substantial anti-HIV-1 activity in cultured cells at non-cytotoxic doses. The HSV helicase-primase inhibitors offer proof of principle that a viral helicase complex can be specifically differentiated from and selectively inhibited among a pool of related cellular helicases in cell-based experiments and in an infectious animal model without significant cytotoxicities. Although the conserved helicase motifs within the helicases are very similar, individual helicases are widely divergent in their coding sequences, raising the possibility that each individual protein could be targeted with specificity in a knowledge-based manner. As highlighted in TABLE 1, an emerging picture is that viruses either encode their own helicase or use a cellular helicase for replication. For example, poxviruses, papovaviruses and pathogenic RNA viruses, such as West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Dengue fever virus, all encode viral helicases that could potentially be future antiviral targets. Regrettably, other than the rare drug candidates that we have mentioned in this review, there currently are no clinically useful candidate compounds for viral helicases. Cumulated successes against virusencoded helicases are likely to precede effective drug targeting of cellular helicases used by viruses.",
