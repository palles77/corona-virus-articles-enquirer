Most analogues proved active against influenza B virus in the low micromolar range, and the best compounds (11, 13, 14 and 16) even reached the sub-micromolar potency of zanamivir (EC 50 \u00bc 0.060 mM), and markedly exceeded (up to 327 times) the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin. Activity was also observed for two influenza A strains, including a virus with the S31N mutant form of M2 proton channel, which is the most prevalent resistance mutation for amantadine. Importantly, the compounds displayed nanomolar activity against RSV and a superior selectivity index, since the ratio of cytotoxic to antiviral concentration was >10,000 for the three most active compounds 11, 14 and 16 (EC 50~0 .008 mM), far surpassing the potency and safety profile of the licensed drug ribavirin (EC 50 \u00bc 5.8 mM, SI > 43).",

The acute respiratory illnesses caused by these viruses represent major medical problems, given their significant morbidity and potential mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations such as small infants, elderly people or patients with underlying medical conditions [1] . Besides, the threat for new influenza A virus pandemics (such as that of 2009 [2] ) is a reason for global and constant concern. Since the current arsenal of antiviral drugs to treat or prevent influenza or RSV infections is quite limited [1, 3] , new therapeutics are highly needed. According to a recommendation by the World Health Organization [4] , attention should be given to innovative agents with broad activity against diverse respiratory viruses.",

Most approved antiviral drugs target unique proteins encoded by one virus or a range of closely related viruses. This strategy is prone to selecting drug-resistance, particularly for viruses, which possess high mutability (such as influenza virus) or require long-term therapy. An alternative and relevant approach is to address host factors involved in the viral life cycle. This type of inhibitors is anticipated to possess a markedly higher barrier for selecting drug-resistant viruses and, furthermore, may display broad-spectrum antiviral activity when dealing with a cellular target that is recruited by different viruses. Two host-directed antiviral drugs are maraviroc, a CCR5 receptor antagonist approved for HIV therapy, and alisporivir, a cyclophylin inhibitor that is undergoing Phase III tests for hepatitis C treatment [5] . Specific host proteins were proven to be critical for the replication of diverse unrelated viruses [6] , yet the array of possible cellular targets (the 'virus-host interactome') is continuously growing, as recently reviewed for influenza [7] and RSV [8] .",

            "text": "The first example of a broadly-acting antiviral drug is ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue that was proposed to act directly at the level of the viral polymerase, although an indirect effect via inhibition of the host-cell IMP dehydrogenase and depletion of the GTP pool seems more plausible [9] . Another enzyme of the purine and pyrimidine pathways is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF), a crucial cofactor for the biosynthesis of IMP and thymidylate. Folate antagonists interfering with DHFR can be applied in diverse pharmacological (i.e. antimalarial, antibacterial and antineoplastic) settings [10e13] . The licensed antifolates trimethoprim [14] , pyrimethamine [15] and cycloguanil are potent inhibitors of bacterial and protozoal DHFR, respectively, but only weak inhibitors of mammalian DHFR enzymes. On the other hand, the drug methotrexate (MTX) is a potent unselective DHFRs inhibitor (Ki \u00bc 0.01e0.2 nM) [16] , because of its close structural similarity with dihydrofolic acid, the natural substrate of the enzyme [17] . MTX shows a binding affinity to human DHFR (hDHFR) 1000-fold higher than that of folic acid [16] , explaining its clinical application as anticancer, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agent. Indeed, the MTX capability of affecting different intracellular pathways has been very recently described, highlighting a rather complex mechanism of action besides the most important therapeutic activity related to hDHFR inhibition [18] . Ongoing research efforts to develop novel antifolates for cancer chemotherapy and microbial infections continue to be extensively reviewed [19] . Cycloguanil is the active metabolite of the antimalarial drug proguanil (Paludrine \u00ae or Malarone \u00ae ), that is approved for prophylaxis and treatment of infections by Plasmodium vivax or falciparum. The species-selective activity of cycloguanil (and pyrimethamine) has traditionally been attributed to higher affinity of the drug for Plasmodium bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase (DHFR-TS) than for hDHFR [20] . Since 1991, cycloguanil and related 1-aryl-4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazines were studied with the aim at treating Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia [21] , searching for more selective inhibitors for P. Carinii DHFR over host DHFR (especially human enzyme). Indeed, trimethoprim, the antifolate most widely used for that kind of infection, was a poor inhibitor of P. Carinii DHFR (Ki \u00bc 280 mM) and showed about 6-fold greater selectivity for hDHFR (Ki \u00bc 48 mM). Some 1-aryl-4,6diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazines exhibited a selective P. Carinii DHFR inhibition, while cycloguanil and some related analogues (two of them corresponding to our compounds 11 and 14) were disclosed to bind slightly stronger to hDHFR (cycloguanil, Ki \u00bc 43.0 mM) than to P. Carinii enzyme (cycloguanil, Ki \u00bc 109.0 mM). Finally, the Author suggested that not only the expected selective fungal enzyme inhibitors, but even compounds with higher species-selectivity profile for hDHFR showed improvement over agents currently used to treat P. Carinii infections.",

As shown in Table 1 , there was overall correlation between the antiviral EC 50 values obtained by either method, indicating the reliability of the observed antiviral effect. On the other hand, microscopic evaluation revealed that several compounds produced cytostatic effect, yielding a minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of, for instance, 4 mM for cycloguanil (1) . By comparison, its CC 50 value by cell viability assay was 52 mM, indicating that a true cytotoxic effect with manifest cell killing was only seen at higher concentrations of 1. It is worth noting that cycloguanil is the active metabolite of the prodrug proguanil, an antimalarial drug that is considered as safe even when used during pregnancy [35] . Furthermore, most of the compounds were cytotoxic only in MDCK cells while leaving unaffected (MCC > 100 mM) the human HeLa (Table 2 ) and primate Vero cell lines (Table 3) used to grow the other viruses under investigation.

Based on this interesting observation, the study was oriented towards design and synthesis of more effective agents. Firstly, replacement of the chlorine atom in position 4 of the aromatic ring was explored: the introduction of either electron-withdrawing group isosteres of chlorine (F, 5; Br, 6) or electron-donor groups (CH 3 , 3; OCH 3 , 4) was permitted without changing the activity, whereas polar electron-withdrawing groups (NO 2 , COOH and COOEt: 7e9) were detrimental. Having assumed that chlorine is a well-suited substituent, we investigated its influence on the mono-substituted cycloguanil-related 2-Cl (10) and 3-Cl (11) isomers, and on the di-substituted 2,4-dichloro (15) and 3,4-dichloro derivatives (16) . Compounds 11 and 16, bearing a lipophilic electron-withdrawing group in position 3 of the aromatic ring, proved to be strong inhibitors with sub-micromolar potency against influenza B virus (EC 50 \u00bc 0.10 and 0.080 mM, respectively) and only 2-fold lower activity against influenza A viruses. In contrast, compound 10 was only poorly active against influenza B (EC 50 \u00bc 56 mM), while the 2,4-dichloro substitution abolished the activity (15) . Since these data clearly indicated that a lipophilic electron-withdrawing atom in position 3 properly modulates the antiviral activity, we next synthesized the 3-F (12), 3-Br (13) and 3-CF 3 (14) analogues. Compound 14 showed an activity profile comparable to that of 11, whereas bromine derivative 13 was found to be the best influenza B inhibitor among the entire series, having an EC 50 of 0.016 mM. In the next step, we varied the two methyl groups on C(2) of the 4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazine scaffold, by introducing bulkier alkyl groups than the two ones derived from acetone. This was achieved by performing condensation with methyl ethyl ketone (for 18), methyl isopropyl ketone (for 19), cyclopentanone (for 20e22), or cyclohexanone (for 23e25).

Since in vivo application of cycloguanil is through its prodrug proguanil (30), we checked whether also the prodrug and 1-(4chlorophenyl)biguanide (31) possess anti-influenza activity. The two main metabolites of the antimalarial drug proguanil are the active form cycloguanil and the inactive 1-(4-chlorophenyl)biguanide, which constitute about 30% and 23%, respectively, of the total drug concentration in plasma. 32 Both compounds 30 and 31 were shown inactive, alike the anilinedihydrotriazine isomer 29 of cycloguanil. The 2,4-diaminopyrimidines trimethoprim and pyrimethamine were chosen as fully unsaturated cycloguanil analogues: only pyrimethamine (32) influenza B virus appears more sensitive to a reduction in the THF pool. This could point to a higher sensitivity of influenza B virus to nucleotide imbalances [perhaps related to the slower growth kinetics of influenza B compared to influenza A virus [36] , although this seems contradicted by the finding that the GTP-depleting agent ribavirin displayed similar EC 50 values for influenza A and B viruses (Table 1) .",

These compounds inhibited RSV replication at nanomolar concentrations, far surpassing the antiviral activity of ribavirin (EC 50 \u00bc 5.8 mM, SI > 43). The latter is the only small molecule drug to treat RSV infections, but, as a consequence of its limited efficacy, the need of prolonged aerosol administration and the risk of toxicity, its use is limited to children at high risk [39] . Therefore, effective and safe drugs are strongly needed to treat severe RSV-linked respiratory pathologies which can also affect adults and, particularly, elderly. Thus, the highly potent compounds 11, 14 and 16 could be interesting lead compounds for further chemical derivatization and development of improved RSV inhibitors. Similar to what was observed for influenza virus, the drugs cycloguanil (1) and pyrimethamine (32) were found to be equipotent RSV-inhibitors with EC 50 values of 0.55 and 0.75 mM, respectively, which is nearly one order of magnitude superior to the value of ribavirin.",

Host-targeting antivirals represent an alternative and emerging strategy to address host factors involved in virus life cycle. This type of inhibitors could show a markedly higher barrier for selecting drug-resistant viruses and, furthermore, display broad-spectrum antiviral activity when interacting with a common cellular target that is recruited by different viruses. The interesting dual activity of the 1-aryl-4,6-diamino-1,2dihydrotriazines against influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, via inhibition of the cellular (human) DHFR enzyme, points to this host factor as a new therapeutic target for these two respiratory viruses. In fact, reversal effect on antiviral activity has been demonstrated in RSV-infected HeLa cells exposed to compound 14 in combination with different concentrations of dihydrofolic acid, such as natural DHFR substrate. The most promising compounds, tested against the recombinant protein of the hDHFR, also confirmed to bind this enzyme in the sub-micromolar range. Kinetic inhibition studies of cycloguanil showed a competitive inhibition behavior, and docking studies disclosed the most probable binding mode for this class of compounds as hDHFR ligands. Notably, the antiviral activity against RSV and influenza B viruses in cell-based assays, the Ki values on the recombinant hDHFR enzyme and, also the estimated binding affinity (DG) shared an interesting comparable SAR trend.",

Of the two influenza A virus strains tested, the A/Ned/378/05 strain carries a wild type M2 protein. Against this strain, the three most active cycloguanil analogues (11, 14 and 16) displayed comparable potency as zanamivir and rimantadine, while surpassing ribavirin and amantadine. The A/Virginia/ATCC3/2009 strain, which has an S31N mutant M2 protein alike most currently circulating influenza A strains, had marginal to no sensitivity to the adamantane-based M2-blockers. This strain was strongly susceptible to compounds 11, 14 and 16 with EC 50 values of about 1 mM, which is 2-fold and 8-fold better than the values of zanamivir and ribavirin, respectively. Whereas the antiviral EC 50 values were nicely comparable for the two influenza A strains tested, all active analogues displayed higher activity (lower EC 50 value) against influenza B virus. In fact, 73% of all compounds inhibited influenza B virus with EC 50 values in the range of 0.016e29 mM. Hence, compared to influenza A,",
