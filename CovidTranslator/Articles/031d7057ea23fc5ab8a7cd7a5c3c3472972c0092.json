By this model definition, we are able to detect the beginning of each bubble period even before it bursts.

From a macroeconomic point of view, the property sector is an aspect of paramount importance of the holistic performance of economy. In fact, over the past few decades the real estate industry has been a target of government fiscal and monetary policies aimed at achieving balanced economic growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. However, policy makers seem to have no way in restraining bubbles in real estate markets; indeed, their adherence to orthodox policies (e.g. easy monetary policy or low interest rates to avoid recession) may be making the problems worse [1] .",

The rise is usually followed by a reversal of expectations and a sharp decline in price often resulting in financial crisis''. In other words, bubble is a huge rise in prices followed by a crash. Speculative bubbles have the special characteristics that they are persistent, systematic and exhibit increasing deviations of prices from their fundamental values [3] .",

After the peak in 1991, land prices fell by more than 90% while stock prices slumped badly by 80%, which led to much lower economic growth ratio and a sharp rise in unemployment in the following decades. In August 1997 the Asian Tigers suffered a similar crisis, after asset price bubbles collapsed. While the trigger was the collapse of the currency, it was the massive rise and subsequent fall of property and stock prices that made the aftermath so painful [1] . Most recently, the Subprime Mortgage Crisis that began in August 2007 lies at the center of recent turmoil in housing and credit markets. A number of studies have examined the Subprime Mortgage Crisis and its tremendous effect to the real economy (see Refs. [4, 5] for a survey). Some articles document that real estate markets could be related to financial crises. For instance, Edelstein and Paul [6] and Mera [7, 8] argue that several ''urban economic policies'', such as land use regulation, are partially responsible for the formation of the land price bubble in Japan, which led to the financial crisis later. Renaud [9] connects the real estate cycles and banking crises in Asia. Wong [10] finds that the 1997 financial crisis in Thailand is related to the real estate bubble.",

Debate on house price bubbles mostly focuses on charts of house prices to income or rent ratios, or mortgage payment to income ratios (see Refs. [15] [16] [17] for examples), because it seems reasonable to cite the currently low level of the rent-price ratio as a sign that we are in a housing price bubble. However, Meen [18] argues that there is no stable relationship between house prices and rents or between house prices and income. The main reason is that the discount factor of future rents or income is not stable over time. Therefore, evaluations of house prices have to consider a discount factor as well.",

Basically the specification of these methods is developed to compare the volatility between the assumed fundamental housing price and the actual housing price. If the volatility of the actual housing price is significantly larger than that of the assumed fundamental housing price, the test will claim that housing price bubbles are being detected indirectly. However, Marsh and Merton [25] provide a striking example which provides evidence that variance bounds test fails when dividends and stock prices are non-stationary (see also Ref. [26] ).

Kim and Lee [27] employ the cointegration test to examine the existence of real estate price bubbles in Korea. More recently, Hui and Shen [14] incorporate econometrical methodologies into a Reduced Form Equations structure to study housing price bubbles in Shanghai and Beijing. Taipalus [17] develops a rolling sub-sample Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) indicator to test log rent-price ratio for the existence of real estate bubbles for Finland, USA, UK, Spain and Germany, and the results suggest bubbles exist in nearly all of these countries. However, these direct tests can only provide necessary, but not sufficient, evidence of bubbles existing because rejecting the no-bubble hypothesis is not the same as detecting a bubble. As Gurkaynak [24] argues, econometric detection of asset price bubbles cannot be achieved with a satisfactory degree of certainty despite recent advances, especially when dealing with small sample econometrics problems.",

However this definition is generally thought to be not very practical, because it is very difficult to definitively identify a bubble until after the fact-that is, when it is bursting we confirm its existence (see Ref. [29] ). Zhou and Sornette [30] give a mathematical description of the end of the bubbles as the spontaneous singularity assuming that a crash follows after rapid growth of economic indicators faster than an exponential function. Although their method is practically useful for prediction of the end of a bubble, it says nothing about the start of a bubble. There is little mathematical definition or criterion formula to identify the start of the bubble period. Recently, Watanabe et al. [31, 32] introduce a mathematical definition of bubbles and crashes by exponential behaviors detected in the systematic data analysis. Their mathematical model could identify the whole period of a bubble or a crash determined purely from past data, and the start of a bubble can be identified even before its burst. However, there are still some limitations in practice. Firstly, they fix the optimal time scale T i for observing the exponential behaviors to be constant, e.g. 100 days. Secondly, the coarse-graining scale of data t needs to be very small, like 30 s around in order to derive reasonable results. Unfortunately, we can just get monthly or daily data in some certain markets (e.g. real estate markets) due to the limitation of data frequency. Therefore, we will improve this model in this paper so that it can be used in the real estate market reasonably.",

Then we draw a trend curve for each connected divergent period by approximating the price fluctuation in each period by one exponential function of Eq. (3).

The reason is that the coarsegraining scale of data ( t) should be very small, like 30 s around in order to derive reasonable results. Unfortunately, we can just get monthly or daily data in some certain markets (e.g. real estate markets or some property securities index) due to the limitation of data frequency.

All five property securities indices plunge after the Subprime Mortgage Crisis happened. It is interesting that the index of Hong Kong Property Securities market culminated in Jan, 2008, about one year later than the average of other countries studied in this paper. Table 1 provides the mean and standard deviation and other statistic parameters for all index series.

The property securities indices escalated dramatically during the past five years, and the recent boom of the real estate market seems unique in its pervasiveness. According to the tendency of property securities indices, we document that USA and Singapore suffer the exponential crashes recently. Other countries (the United Kingdom and Hong Kong), however, undertake different level of crashes. In other words, the collapses of property securities markets in the USA and Singapore are more seriously than other countries in our study.",

Due to the difficulties of assessing the fundamental value of the property markets, the purpose of this paper is to contribute the literature on the definition and detect property bubbles by exponential fitting of the lower frequency historical data (e.g. real estate or property securities markets) without the presence of fundamental value.",

This method is powerful in detecting bubbles and crashes in the financial markets; though it cannot be used to predict the end of either bubble or crash [31, 32] , which would be focused on in our further study. In order to apply the model when t is 1 day, we improve the fixed T i to be dynamic T i , fitting by regression model. The result of the improvement model is shown by Fig. A. 3.",
