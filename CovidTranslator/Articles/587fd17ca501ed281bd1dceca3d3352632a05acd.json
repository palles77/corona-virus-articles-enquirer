Engaging globally in health requires the creation of relevant and eff ective partnerships to implement solutions for shared or common problems. To build on the UK's achievements and leadership in global health, the central government Department of Health is now leading the development of a UK Government-wide global strategy. This paper describes the rationale and process for developing the new UK Government-wide strategy for global health and highlights some of the issues that must be discussed.",

Globalisation can also pose risks to human health-for example, through unfair trade and its regulation, inequitable distribution of natural resources, and poorly managed migration. The key issue for policymakers is how these benefi ts can be harnessed while minimising the potential for harm. The Whitehall Permanent Secretaries regularly discuss how the UK government best responds to globalisation. The group promulgates UK action to maximise the opportunities of globalisation in areas such as development, climate change, energy security, trade and industry, science and innovation, education, and global health.",

            "text": "The US Institute of Medicine, in a 1997 report, 4 made a strong case for why that country would benefi t from investing in health abroad. The report identifi ed three pillars: protecting people, enhancing the economy, and advancing international interests. In 1999, the then director general of WHO, Gro Harlem Brundtland, reminded the international community that investing in global health was good politics, good economics, and good for national and international security. 5 A Lancet Editorial recently described the advantages of using health as an instrument of foreign policy, 6 such as protecting nations against health threats, social cohesion, strengthened national infra structure, improving bilateral relations, and encouraging trust across global multilateral agencies. Five key reasons exist for why the UK Government should do more than it does at present to prom ulgate global health. Engagement with the global health agenda can improve global security and health protection, enhance sustainable development, improve trade by promoting health as a commodity, maximise potential of global public goods, and encourage a human rights approach to health. Potential confl icts exist between them. For example, reconciling UK trade interests (includ ing trade in health commodities) with sound pro-poor development policy and maintenance of international human rights might be diffi cult. Also, global health should not be seen solely in security terms. That would create a security triage in which health issues that rep resent security threats are given automatic priority over others. Another potential area of diffi culty is where the military is associated with peacekeeping and service deliv ery. Local populations can be unclear on mandates and non-governmental organisations might have con cerns about erosion of humanitarian space. 7 A coherent UK glo bal-health strategy is important in navigating an econom ically and ethically acceptable path through these fi ve areas.",

An infl uenza pandemic is an obvious example of a global-security threat. HIV and AIDS are inextricably linked with national and global security. AIDS is crippling economies and also compro mising the governance, state stability, and military capacities of many African countries. 10 In view of South Africa's international tourism boom and global trade and transport systems, recent emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is another example of disease with a global threat. 11 Migration brings economic and social benefi ts. Although many migrants are healthy, some have complex, specifi c health needs (eg, mental health, communicable disease). 12 People developing communicable disease control policies, such as pre-embarkation screening for tuberculosis and HIV, should do so on the basis of sound public-health evidence.",

The commission estimated that in developing countries, a basic health-care package of US$34 per person would save 8 million lives a year, which would generate economic benefi ts of $360 billion. Tactically sound action across government could encourage African countries to implement the Commission for Africa's recommendation that they spend 15% of their national income on health and that resources are used to support health interventions that are proven to be most cost eff ective. 15, 16 The macroeconomic eff ects of the HIV pandemic are substantial. 17, 18 In eastern Europe, 80% of people infected with HIV are of working age. Malaria is slowing African economic growth by up to 1\u00b73% a year, costing more than $12 billion yearly. Controlling endemic malaria in Africa will raise its gross domestic product by 20% over 15 years. Tobacco use results in a yearly global net loss of $200 billion. The $300 million investment in global smallpox eradication returned more than $3 billion in economic benefi ts. 19 Improvements in health might have contributed to as much as a third of the east Asian economic miracle. 20",

Worldwide, the health-care industry is worth more than US$3 trillion yearly. 21 The estimated value of healthcare products and services exported from the UK in 2005 was \u00a314 billion. Pharmaceutical industry exports are estimated at \u00a312\u00b72 billion, creating a trade surplus of \u00a33\u00b74 billion. The UK's medical device market is the fourth largest in Europe, with an estimated value of \u00a34 billion. Globally, the industry is an attractive target for abuse. According to Transparency International the medi cal sector is seen as being more corrupt than the military sector. 22 Enhancing the eff ect of industry on global health requires greater focus on access for the poorest people in the world than exists at present. Increasing the number of public-private partnerships that include commercial drug and biotechnology companies is one way to do this. A second approach is fairer regulation of international trade. The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement is designed to protect the rights of patent holders over knowledge systems or products including, for example, drugs. In 2003, World Trade Organisation (WTO) members agreed that developing countries with insuffi cient manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector could make eff ective use of the compulsory licensing provisions contained in the TRIPs agreement, which was amended in 2005. These changes are designed to make it easier for poor countries to import cheaper generic medicines if they are unable to manufacture them. Developed countries have an obligation to help poor countries make the most of these fl exibilities with the aid for trade approach. 23 The General Agreement on Trade in Services is the fi rst multilateral trade agreement to cover trade and investment in services. It constitutes the legal framework through which WTO members progres-sively liberalise trade in services, including, where members wish, health-related services. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, a UN Food and Agriculture Organization and WHO body, sets standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and other recommendations for food quality and safety to protect consumers from food-borne illness from home-grown and imported food and ensure fair trade practices in the food trade.",

First, it could give additional legitimacy for individual government departments and non-governmental agencies to invest in and take action on global health. Second, it could be an accountability mechanism for govern ment delivery on existing frameworks that aff ect global health. Third, it could help to prioritise areas for action. A global-health strategy provides the opportunity for individual Government departments and agencies to ask themselves whether their engagement in global health is suffi cient. For example, many of the central government Department of Health's objectives and targets under its Pub lic Service Agreement (reducing adult smoking rates and halting the rise in obesity in children younger than 11 years) have a global dimension and require global engagement.",

The separation of domestic and international health problems is less relevant than it used to be as people and goods travel across continents. The strategy also widened the traditional infectious-disease control functions to encompass health protection-including combating chemical, environmental, and radiation hazards. The value of this approach was shown in the response to the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian intelligence offi cer, with polonium. 33 WHO, for example, often struggles to get professionals working in the UK health system released to work on global health priorities. In February, 2007, the ex-Chief Executive of the NHS, Lord Crisp, published a report commissioned by the Prime Minister on how the UK and the NHS can do more to strengthen the health capacity of developing countries. This report provides an opportunity for UK development partners to think about engaging more strategically in this area. 34 Independent of the priorities that arise from the global-health strategy, Government departments can work together more eff ectively. The UK Government should speak with a clear and unifi ed voice on the role and mandate of WHO and other multilateral agencies with an interest in health. Many of the Government's health targets need international solutions that can only be tackled through the input of a number of domestic Government departments. The human-rights agreements to which the UK Government has signed up encompass availability of health care, health promotion and protection, safe water, adequate sanitation, and occupational and environmental conditions conducive to good health.",
