            "text": "Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) contributed to significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. We aimed to establish the validity, reliability and responsiveness of the functional impairment checklist (FIC) as a measurement tool for physical dysfunction in SARS survivors. One hundred and sixteeen (65 females and 51 males, mean age 45.6) patients who joined the SARS rehabilitation programme were analysed. The factor analysis yielded two latent factors. The mean FIC-symptom and FIC-disability score were 24.12 (SD \u00b1 20.2) and 26.11 (SD \u00b1 27.32), respectively. Based on the item-scale correlation coefficients, the Cronbach's alpha coefficients reflecting the internal consistency reliability of scale score were 0.75 for FICsymptom and 0.86 for FIC-disability. Test-retest reliability in 23 patients showed no statistical significant difference in the FIC scores between tests with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.49-0.57. The FIC scales correlated both with 6 munute walking test (6MWT) distance ()0.26 and )0.38) and handgrip strength (HGS) ()0.20 and )0.27). Moreover, the FIC scales correlated with St. George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) (0.19 to 0.52) and short form 36 Hong Kong (SF-36) domains ()0.19 to )0.59). Both FIC scales correlated stronger with physical component summary (PCS) ()0.41 and )0.55) than with mental component summary (MCS) ()0.30 and )0.23). FIC reduced significantly at 6 months while the SF-36 PCS and MCS did not show any change. In conclusion, the study results indicate the FIC is reliable, valid and responsive to change in symptom and disability as a consequence of SARS, suggesting it may provide a means of assessing health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes in a longitudinal follow up.

At the height of the SARS crisis in May 2003, a panel of medical researchers and specialist clinicians joined the Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food to outline advances in treatment protocol and rehabilitation programme for SARS patients. The recommendation was that all those in need must receive comprehensive and standardized assessment, followed by rehabilitation services. The Hospital Authority Hong Kong introduced interdisciplinary rehabilitation programs tailor-made for recovered SARS patients. The Wong Tai Sin Hospital (WTSH) became the first to launch the program in May 2003 [7] . In order to provide effective rehabilitation programs for SARS patients, it was critical to develop a clinical tool or checklist to identify and quantify the morbidity among SARS survivors so as to evaluate the extent of impairment and disability [3, 6] .",

However, because SARS was a novel disease, no existing HRQOL instrument was applicable for the necessary assessment. To fill the void, the Hospital Authority Hong Kong designed an instrument called functional impairment checklist (FIC) to make post-SARS evaluation. The FIC was a symptom and disability focused questionnaire adopted as a territory wide functional assessment tool in the Post-SARS clinics. In addition to evaluating post-SARS health related issues, the FIC also served as a clinical checklist for referral to the SARS rehabilitation programme. The FIC was complemented by two other existing HRQOL assessment tools to make disease-specific and generic quality of life assessment. The diseasespecific tools used in the SARS rehabilitation program was a respiratory disease tool validated for chronic obstructive lung diseases and asthma, the St. George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) [12] . The generic quality-of-life measure, short form 36 Hong Kong (SF-36) (HK), was included as to measure the more global issues affecting the physical and psychological well being [13] for this novel disease with unknown sequelae.",

The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong had convened a Working Group on Physical and Psychosocial rehabilitation that comprised respiratory physicians, rehabilitation physicians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, clinical psychologists, social workers and community partners from all cluster territories in Hong Kong. Twenty-four experts in the Working Group convened a series of urgent meetings to review the transcripts, they analysed the qualitative information and decided on a set of standardized assessment tools. The team reduced the physical items to 8 and eliminated the psychological domain. The team determined that the psychological assessment would be better performed by the clinical psychologists using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) [16] and the impact of event scale revised (IES-R) [17] . The FIC would serve as a symptom and disability checklist for the general or chest physicians and as a screening tool for physical rehabilitation specifically for SARS patients. Before the targeted launch of the FIC for clinical use in June 2003, Hospital Authority convened a meeting with 20 Respiratory Physicians to receive their comments. The next step was to conduct focus group discussions with SARS patients to explore potentially relevant items and establish the content validity for the FIC. In June, WTSH conducted a series of four focus group discussions with 48 SARS patients. The disease severity of the patients interviewed varied from mild to severe, and included SARS patients who were in convalescence and those who had been discharged home. The results of the focus groups showed that the items on the FIC were representative of the physical symptoms and the functional disability experienced by the SARS survivors.",

The purpose of developing an effective standardized assessment was to help us make comprehensive assessment, identify the needs of rehabilitation and evaluate the long term consequences of the diseases for the SARS survivors. This study showed that the FIC was an internally consistent and reliable tool for the assessment of physical symptoms and disability in patients recovered from SARS. The FIC showed a high degree of construct validity. The FIC scores correlated well with the physical function measurement, SF-36 (HK) and SGRQ. There was good discriminant ability and the FIC was able to differentiate patients with different levels of quality of life and physical performance. The FIC scores were significantly higher in patients with impaired SF-36 (HK) and 6MWT measurement, suggesting the internal validity of the FIC. The test and retest reliability also demonstrated the reliability in the paired tests. In addition, there was a significant reduction in FIC scores at 6 months after rehabilitation as compared with baseline, and similar improvement was observed in other physical function parameters despite a slight difference in the relative magnitude. This suggested that FIC could be used as an evaluative tool to assess the functional profile of SARS patients longitudinally.",

Although there were studies on the short-term outcome and risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes, there was limited knowledge about the functional consequences of SARS [36, 37] . Clinical follow-up of people recovered from SARS demonstrated radiological, functional and psychological abnormalities of varying degrees in the recovery period [5] .

Non-ventilatory limitation during exercise was noted in the majority of our rehabilitation group and very few subjects had desaturation during the 6MWT.
