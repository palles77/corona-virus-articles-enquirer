Primer extension experiments showed that the RNA expressing this gene is shorter than the complete ORF, and could form a protein of M r 85 540. The protein was expressed by recombinant baculovirus and was recognized by anti-virion serum, indicating a structural role. Sequence comparison indicates that astrovirus serotypes 1 and 2 differ markedly in the C-terminal half of the protein but are well conserved towards the N-terminus.",

            "text": "Astroviruses are spherical, non-enveloped positive strand RNA viruses first observed in the faeces of human infants with diarrhoea [1]. The 28 nm particles have a smooth margin and a proportion display a characteristic five or six pointed star motif on their surfaces (from which the viruses are named). Astroviruses have since been found in a variety of hosts and are often associated with gastrointestinal symptoms [2] . Early difficulties in the culture of these viruses impeded their study, however several isolates were adapted to growth in tissue culture by passage through primary human embryo cells [3] . This requirement limited the isolations made in the past, but now viruses can be grown directly from diarrhoeal stools [4] . Molecular biological experiments have shown that astroviruses resemble the Caliciviridae in their synthesis of an intracellular subgenomic RNA from the 3' end of the genome [5, 6] , but differ from this family in possessing 3-4 structural proteins, a property in which they resemble the Picornaviridae. Furthermore, in contrast to the picornaviruses, it is possible that virus replication may involve the host cell nucleus [2] . These features led to the recognition of the astroviruses as a distinct family, the Astroviridae [7] .",

Recently Monroe and co-workers [5] described the synthesis of a protein (M r 90000) in astrovirus serotype 2-infected cells which could be processed by trypsin to yield products resembling virion proteins. Finally the sequence of the astrovirus type 2 subgenomic RNA has been reported [9] .

We therefore mapped the 5' end of the virus subgenomic RNA by primer extension (Fig. 3) . A prominent termination product (135n) was observed, co-migrating with base 286 in the sequence. Fainter terminations were obtained 5' to PACG T P 4 4 ,4 this strong stop; all of these are indicated in Fig.  2 .

Figure 4 demonstrates the induction of immunoprecipitable astrovirus-specific protein following Sf21 cell infection with this recombinant. A protein (M r approx. 90 000) was observed in increasing amounts from 4 days post-infection; a smaller protein (M r 40000) was also precipitated concurrently. The 90 000 protein identified by Monroe [5] is thought to be cleaved to yield the structural proteins of the virion and we attribute this smaller species to partial cleavage in this unnatural host cell. Both proteins were selectively immunoprecipitated with rabbit antiserum raised to astrovirus type 1 particles, confirming a relationship between these products and virion structural peptides. The material remaining at the top of the gel is also observed in immunoprecipitates prepared from astrovirus-infected CaCO 2 cells. No proteins were precipitated from mock-infected Sf21 cells, or those infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing feline calicivirus proteins, at the same time post-infection. Figure 5 compares the proteins predicted from astrovirus serotype 1 with those from serotype 2. This indicates that the extent of similarity varies in different regions of the proteins. The serotype 2 virus protein is 10 residues longer than that of serotype 1 but both proteins are clearly related at the N terminus. Between residues 1 and 415 (numbers relative to serotype 2 virus) amino acids are 85.6% conserved. This number rises to 90.6% similarity if maintenance of amino acid character is taken into account. Between residues 416 and 707 the sequences are only 41.7% conserved (56.2% if allowance is made for substitutions which maintain the character of the residue). This region includes a highly variant area 649-707 in which only 16.9% of amino acids are conserved and only 28.8% are similar; 8 of the 10 extra residues present in serotype 2 are deleted from serotype 1 in this region. Finally, towards the C terminal conservation and similarity once again rise reaching 61.8% and 74.2%, respectively. Despite these changes in sequence, the hydropathy profiles of the two serotype proteins are very similar (not shown). In particular, a stretch of basic residues is present in both serotypes between residues 18 and 34. A similar sequence is present in some coronavirus capsid proteins [14] . It will be of great interest to compare the sequences of proteins from other astrovirus serotype proteins with that presented here.",

This open reading frame overlaps that of the structural proteins by 186 bases. This is larger than such overlaps seen in the caliciviruses [14] . However, primer extension studies indicate that not all of the potential open reading frame is actually expressed as mRNA, and the 5' gene thus overlaps the expressed region of the structural protein open reading frame by only six bases. This presumptive mRNA start position is three bases upstream from that identi-fled by Monroe [9] .
