Transmission dynamics models are well suited to address infectious disease scenarios that do not conform to these assumptions. For example, these models easily account for changes in the incidence rates of infection as the proportions of susceptible and infectious persons change in the population. Fundamental concepts relating to these methods, such as the basic reproductive number, the effective reproductive number and the susceptible-infected-recovered compartmental models, are reviewed. In addition, comparisons and contrasts are made between the following concepts: microparasites and macroparasites, deterministic and stochastic models, difference and differential equations and homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing patterns. Finally, examples of how transmission dynamics models are being applied to factors associated with emerging infectious diseases, such as zoonotic origins, microbial adaption and change, human susceptibility and climate change, are reviewed.",

            "text": "One set of methods that epidemiologists use to better understand emerging infections is mathematical transmission dynamics models. These models describe the transmission of an infectious agent between hosts (humans, animals and/or vectors) in a population. One historical example of their usefulness in furthering our understanding of infections is Sir Ronald Ross' (1857-1932) hypothesis and mathematical model that a community could eliminate malaria by sufficiently reducing the size of the mosquito population. 2 Transmission dynamics models such as Sir Ross' are known to be highly nonlinear 3 and cannot be captured with traditional statistical models, requiring instead a range of calculus-based methods. However, the fundamental concept of keeping a model as simple as possible, while accounting for only the most important factors, is similar to what is done in traditional statistical models. 3 For example, consider the series of images in Figure 1. All the panels are sketches of a bull. The simplest sketch lacks detail and could possibly be confused with other animals, such as a cow or a buffalo. As additional detail is added to the sketches, it becomes readily apparent that the sketch is truly a bull. However, to describe how an infectious agent is transmitted between hosts in a large population, a model as rough as the simplest sketch may be sufficient. Despite the science and mathematics involved in developing infectious disease transmission dynamics models, there is also a certain amount of art entailed; and perhaps surprisingly, usually less is more. Chief among many reasons to keep the model simple is to make it easily comprehensible to a wide audience, including both scientists and policy makers. 4, 5 Thus, infectious disease clinicians/epidemiologists are placed in a paradox. The transmission of emerging infections is often complex, involving several hosts and important small population clusters, yet, the most desirable models to describe the transmission are simple. In addition, most clinicians and public health professionals are not exposed to approaches in which theory (in contrast to data) is the base of developing a model. The theory-based model is used to simulate scenarios of transmission and control, which may be later verified by field data. This approach may provoke a sense of unease and skepticism among the uninitiated researcher or clinician. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of some of the common methods used in transmission dynamics models and illustrate their uses in the context of emerging infectious diseases. Ultimately, our goal is to demonstrate that transmission dynamics models can be helpful in better understanding how emerging and reemerging infections are being transmitted and how best to control them.",

Similar to R 0 , R is influenced by the number of contacts per unit time, the transmission probability per contact and duration of infectiousness; however, as the number of susceptibles in the population decreases, so will the number of individuals who can be infected by each case.

The simplest approach is to begin with a closed population of size N, where there are no births or deaths affecting the size of the population (including deaths from infection). These models are helpful in counting the flow of individuals through the compartments over the course of time of an epidemic. That is, at time t, the rate at which susceptibles move from S to I is equal to c\u060bp\u060b(I/N), and the rate at which people move from I to R is equal to 1/d, where d represents the average duration of infectiousness.

This is important because the intensity of infection (ie, number of parasites infecting the host) impacts the infectiousness of the host. Some additional differences between macroparasites and microparasites are the following: the generation time for macroparasites is longer than for microparasites; hosts rarely develop full immunity to reinfection with macroparasites; and the death rates of macroparasites have greater variability than those observed in microparasites. These factors can be accommodated using increasingly complex compartmental models. 10 Even though a large number of macroparasites are considered as reemerging, the majority of emerging infectious diseases in the United States are microparasites (Table 1) ; thus, most of the examples will be those of microparasites.",

In deterministic models, the size of each compartment is influenced by fixed rates of emigration (going out) and immigration (coming in), which can result in fractions of people being assigned to a given compartment. In contrast, stochastic models incorporate the role of chance in determining whether an event occurs (eg, that transmission occurs given an exposure) and, thus, either an event occurs or it does not. Fractions of people are not allowed to enter compartments, and thus stochastic models attempt to better model reality in transmission of Transmission Dynamics Models infectious disease scenarios. However, because stochastic models are usually run through thousands of iterations to identify the average probability of observing the modeled event, the results from deterministic and stochastic models are often similar when applied to large populations. 7 However, by running a stochastic model through many iterations, a distribution of outcomes is obtained, which is more informative than the average result obtained from a deterministic model. 4, 11 Stochastic models have at least 2 advantages over deterministic models. First, they are better at modeling the probability of an epidemic running a course through extinction. 7 Second, they do not require the assumption of a large sample size (which may be unrealistic in some settings) that deterministic models need. 6 There are 2 primary obstacles to developing stochastic models. One is a lack of computing power necessary to run increasingly complex models through the necessary number of iterations, and the other is the increased intellectual difficulty demanded in incorporating the stochastic components. Computing power is rapidly becoming more available to the average infectious disease clinician/epidemiologist. 5 The decision to overcome the second obstacle is a personal decision. Thus, our recommendation to the novice modeler is to start with deterministic models and work into stochastic models as competence and interest dictates.",

That is, difference equations can be used to model discrete changes in time, whereas differential equations use calculus-based principles to model continuous changes in time. 11 The chained binomial probability (eg, the Reed-Frost model) is a well-known example of the use of discrete time events modeled using the compartmental model structure. 12 Because infection transmission occurs on a continuous time-scale, differential models are often preferred. However, the straightforward nature of differ-ence equations can provide useful approximations without intimidating less proficient mathematicians.",

The types of interactions necessary for transmission of measles (transmitted via the airborne route) are vastly different from those necessary to transmit genital herpes. In addition, there are complex patterns that dictate how people within populations interact with each other. For example, while typical school-aged children spend the majority of their time mixing with other children of their same age, the parent of that child likely mixes with a much broader age range of individuals in the same community because of activities related to work, hobbies, etc. Despite the obvious complex pattern of mixing among individuals, basic transmission dynamics models assume that individuals within a population mix homogeneously. 7 That is, the probability of a given individual coming into sufficient contact to transmit infection is equal in every other individual in that population, regardless of age, gender or social status.",

Furthermore, relatively simple adaptations were made to models of sexually transmitted infections (ie, differentiating between males and females) that were able to move this class of models forward. A major advance in transmission dynamics models has been the development of methods to account for heterogeneous mixing patterns. These methods typically rely on matrices in which the columns and rows represent the characteristics of the subpopulations and individual cells are estimates of probabilities of contact or contact rates between each subpopulation as shown in Table 2 . 12, 13 Another method to account for heterogeneous mixing patterns is the use of social networks, 13 for example, areas where public transportation is common in contrast to areas where most individuals use their own transportation. This summarizes some of the basic concepts in the structure of transmission dynamics models. The dichotomy of methods and assumptions illustrates the choice that the modeler must make in determining the complexity of the model and hopefully facilitates the reading of this type of research. We also provided guidance regarding factors to consider when choosing which type of model or assumption to pursue. ",

Zoonoses not only account for approximately 75% of all emerging infections 14 but also have been responsible for some of the most devastating pandemics in world history [ie, plague, Spanish influenza and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS]. 15 Most of the zoonotic pathogens that have been modeled are viruses (with influenza and SARS accounting for almost half of all zoonotic models). 15 Modeling infection transmission accounting for spread from the animal reservoir is often an important step in understanding the relevant dynamics. However, the impact of including animal reservoirs in the model is as varied as each zoonotic infection. For example, while HIV can be considered a zoonotic infection in the strictest sense of the word, ongoing spread from the animal reservoir plays an insignificant (if any) role in the overall spread of HIV, which is principally spread person to person. In contrast, tick-borne infections, such as Lyme disease, are not known to be transmitted person to person, and therefore modeling infection transmission from the reservoir is critical. In between these 2 ends of the transmission spectrum are infections such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, which is primarily spread by escaping the animal host (by contaminated food products) but can also be spread person to person via the fecal-oral route.",
