The epicenter of the South Korean COVID-19 outbreak has been identified in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million people, approximately 150 miles South East of Seoul. The rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Korea has been attributed to one case linked to a superspreading event that has led to more than 3,900 secondary cases stemming from church services in the city of Daegu (Kuhn, 2020 , Ryall, 2020 . This has led to sustained transmission chains of COVID-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 19, with 55% of the cases associated with the church cluster in Daegu (Bostock, 2020) . Moreover, three other clusters have been reported including one set in Chundo Daenam hospital in Chungdo-gun, Gyeongsanggbuk-do (118 cases), one set in the gym in Cheonan, Chungcheongnam-do (92 cases), and one Pilgrimage to Israel cluster in Gyeongsanggbuk-do (49 cases).

Therefore, we utilize this empirical distribution of reporting delays from the onset to diagnosis to impute the missing dates of onset for the remainder of the cases with missing data. For this purpose, we reconstruct 300 epidemic curves by dates of symptoms onset from which we derive a mean incidence curve of local case incidence and drop the last three data points from the analysis to adjust for reporting delays in our real-time analysis (Tariq et al., 2019) .",

Using the Korean incidence curves for imported and local cases, we estimate the evolution of Rt for COVID-19 in Korea. First, we characterize daily local case incidence using the generalized growth model (GGM) (Viboud et al., 2016) . This model characterizes the growth profile via two parameters: the growth rate parameter ( ) and the scaling of the growth rate parameter ( ). The model captures diverse epidemic profiles ranging from constant incidence ( = 0 ), sub-exponential or polynomial growth (0 < < 1), and exponential growth ( = 1) (Viboud et al., 2016) .

Our current findings suggest sustained disease transmission in the region, underscoring the need to implement a wide array of social distancing measures to rapidly contain the outbreak in Korea, mitigate the morbidity and mortality impact of the disease, and stem the number of case exportations to other nations.",
