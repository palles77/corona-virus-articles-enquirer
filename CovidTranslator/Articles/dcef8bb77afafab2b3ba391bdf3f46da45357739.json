            "text": "The critical host defensive mechanism(s) that are specifically involved in resistance to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) are not known. Apparently, humoral immunity by itself is not protective; instead, it may promote development of vascular lesions and cause a fatal immune-mediated disease (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981a, b, c) . Immune complexes of FIP virus (FIPV), anti-FIPV immunoglobulins, and complement (C3) can be demonstrated in lesions, serum, and in the renal glomeruli of cats with FIP (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Jacobse-Geels et al., 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981a; Jacobse-Geels et al., 1982) . It is presently believed, but not proven, that cellmediated immunity (CMI) plays a decisive role in resistance to FIP. This hypothesis is supported by several observations. Firstly, the clinical incidence of FIP is increased greatly by concurrent infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and FeLV is a powerful suppressant of CMI in cats (Hardy, 1982; Rojko and Olsen, 1984) . Secondly, there is severe necrosis and depletion of lymphocytes in T-dependent areas, and normal to hyperplastic B cells in spleen and lymph nodes of cats with induced FIP (Weiss and Scott, 1981a, c; Hayashi et al., 1983 ) . Thirdly, there is enhanced dissemination of FIPV in macrophages and a more severe disease in thymectomized vs control kittens infected with FIPV (Hayashi et al., 1983) . Also, blastogenesis to T-cell mitogens is suppressed in cats after infection with FIPV (Stoddart et al., 1988) , and blastogenic responses to FIPV, or delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to FIPV inoculated intraconjunctivally, are increased in some FIPV-recovered cats (Pedersen and Floyd, 1985) . Finally, the histopathologic lesions of noneffusive FIP are similar to lesions of tuberculosis or deep mycoses (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis); and CMI in the latter diseases is involved in both immunity and development of lesions (Beeson et al., 1979; Pedersen and Black, 1983) .",

All the cats were FeLV test-negative (by ELISA) and were seronegative for feline coronavirus neutralizing antibodies prior to challenge-exposure with FIPV. The cats were housed separately in cages at the Scott Ritchey Animal Isolation Facilities; housing, care, and testing of cats were in compliance with standards set forth in the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" (NIH publication no. 85-23).

Four of these cats remained seronegative to FIPV; three of the four seronegative cats, however, became febrile 1-2 weeks after IP challenge-exposure. One of 12 cats given 100 LDloo of FIPV survived (cat 11 ) and was asymptomatic for 2 weeks before ID challenge-exposure, and one of four cats given 5000 LDloo of FIPV survived (cat 10) and was asymptomatic for 5 weeks.

Possibly, the histopathology of DTH lesions in cats can be related to certain characteristics of the feline inflammatory response per se. Macrophages are attracted to sites of immunologic activity by lymphokines that are produced and secreted specifically by antigen-primed T lymphocytes (Greene et al., 1984) . The recruited macrophages subsequently can release inflammatory mediators, including leukotrienes (LT), prostaglandins (PG) and complement ( C ) components which are strongly chemotactic for PMN and which can mediate vascular permeability and vasomotor changes (Parker, 1984; Piper, 1984) . Potentially, feline macrophages are activated during CMI reactions and can produce physiologically active amounts of chemotactic molecules and other inflammatory mediators. Indeed, significant increases in plasma or serum LTB4, PGE2, or C3 are found in cats with induced FIP (Jacobse-Geels et al., 1982; ; and C3b complexes are bound to macrophages in FIP lesions (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981a) . It is not known whether activated macrophages of cats produce relatively greater amounts of chemotactic molecules than do macrophages of other species such as humans or guinea pigs, or whether biochemical differences in the secretory products of effector cells are responsible for ir.terspecies variation in the DTH lesion.",

In FIPV, nonimmune control cats, the FIPV inoculum itself caused a persistent but mild neutrophilic perivascular response at PIH 10-12, 24, 48, and 72. In contrast, perivascular dermal responses in the asymptomatic cats were moderate at PIH 24 and were marked with more mononuclear cells at PIH 48 or 72. Other than edema and occasional inflammatory cells, skin lesions were not induced by injection of medium ID in the control cats or by ID injection of medium in cats that had been injected IP once before with the media. It seemed likely that a component of the edema probably was poor fluid resorption following injection of hypertonic solution and bovine serum protein.",

Perhaps the serum antibodies detected by virus neutralization in these cats were not complement-fixing; or, cats may not respond dermatologically to FIPV antigens with classic Arthus-type reactions. Another possibility was that the FIP vasculitis was due primarily to cellular rather than humoral mechanisms (Pedersen, 1985) .

Apparently, cats that develop strong antiviral CMI, with or without humoral immune responses, are resistant to fatal FIP, whereas cats which lack CMI or develop poor CMI responses and respond humorally develop effusive FIP; noneffusive FIP probably is an intermediate stage between immunity and effusive disease (Pedersen, 1983; Pedersen and Black, 1983) . Depending on the CMI response of the cat, low but infectious challenge-exposure dosages of FIPV either can induce protective immunity, or can promote noneffusive FIP (Pedersen, 1983) . In our study, seven of nine asymptomatic DTH skin test-positive cats originally were challenge-exposed with low dosages of FIPV. Four of the cats given low dosages remained VNA-seronegative for 8 weeks before they were ID-tested for DTH; three of those seronegative cats originally had transient fevers within 1-2 weeks after primary challenge-exposure with FIPV (data not shown), suggesting acute infection without seroconversion. Perhaps a low challenge-exposure dose did stimulate CMI {preferentially? ) in the seronegative cats that had strong DTH skin responses to FIPV. In three DTH-positive cats that responded to a low FIPV dose with strong antibody responses, a protective (CMI?) response undoubtedly was also stimulated, because two of these cats (nos. 3 and 4) survived two additional challenge-exposures with highly lethal doses of FIPV, and the third cat (no. 6) successfully resisted an additional challenge-exposure with lethal amounts of FIPV but succumbed eventually to a third dose. A new and significant finding in this study was the apparent loss of protective immunity with time in some of the DTH-positive cats that had initially resisted lethal challenge-exposure (s) with FIPV.",

Seemingly, these DTH-like lesions may represent an ineffectual CMI response to FIPV disseminated perivascularly in macrophages (Weiss and Scott, 1981b; Pedersen, 1983; Pedersen and Black, 1983) . Our findings support this concept because four of six cats (67%) with induced DTH reactions that eventually died and were necropsied also had noneffusive FIP, and another DTH-positive cat had lesions both of noneffusive and effusive FIP. The one DTH-positive cat (no. 11) that died from effusive FIP had neutrophilic dermal infiltrates in skin biopsies at PIH 48 and mixed mononuclear cells and PMNs at PIH 72. Perhaps the lesions in this cat reflect a mixture of cellular and humoral immune responses to FIPV that were not protective. Unfortunately, there seems to be no reliable way to predict histologically -by differences in maximal reaction times, lesion scores or infiltrating cells -which DTH lesions in biopsies indicate complete immunity or which ones indicate partial responses.",
