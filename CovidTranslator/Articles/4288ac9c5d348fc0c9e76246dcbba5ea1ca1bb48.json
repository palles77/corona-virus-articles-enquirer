            "text": "Canine viral respiratory disease is a widespread problem where large numbers of dogs are housed indoors together, such as in shelters, commercial dog colonies, and breeding facilities. The longer dogs are housed in a shelter situation, the greater the risk that respiratory illness will occur. 3 In shelter environments, transmissible respiratory disease (or canine infectious respiratory disease complex [CIRDC] , previously referred to as \" kennel cough\" or canine infectious tracheobronchitis) delays the placement of dogs in homes and can result in unmanageable costs related to treatment, quarantine, and isolation. Transmissible respiratory disease occasionally occurs in owned dogs after a period of contact with large numbers of other dogs at dog parks, dog sporting events such as fly ball, or dog behavior classes. It can also occur after dogs (or dog owners) visit veterinary hospitals, boarding facilities, or pet daycare centers.",

            "text": "With the widespread clinical application of molecular diagnostic assays, it is increasingly apparent that the number of viruses that can infect the canine respiratory tract is much larger than previously thought. This has led to exciting new discoveries in the field of canine infectious respiratory disease, and our knowledge of the pathogens involved continues to expand. Co-infections with multiple viruses and bacteria such as Mycoplasma spp., Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus are common and contribute to an increased severity of disease. [4] [5] [6] Viruses believed to play a role in canine respiratory disease include canine herpesvirus-1 (CHV-1), canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPiV), canine pneumovirus, canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), and canine influenza virus (CIV) ( Table 17-1) . CAV-1 may also play a role when vaccination is not performed or when it is performed improperly. 7 Reoviruses may also play a role. 8 CDV, CHV-1, and CAV are discussed in more detail in Chapters 15, 16 , and 18, respectively. The major bacterial causes of canine transmissible respiratory disease are covered in Part II, Section 2 of this book (Chapters 34, 38, and 40) . Although most of the canine respiratory viruses have a worldwide distribution, their relative prevalence varies from year to year and between geographic locations. Even within a state or city, predominant pathogens may differ from one shelter and boarding kennel to another.",

[11] [12] [13] [14] There is evidence of widespread exposure to CHV-1 in dogs worldwide, 10 and a substantial proportion of the dog population may be latently infected. Like other herpesviruses, CHV-1 becomes latent in neurologic tissues, with precipitation of virus shedding by stress. Consistent with the time delay required for reactivation after stress, CHV-1 was most frequently detected 3 to 4 weeks after dogs were introduced to a rehoming center, whereas CRCoV and CPiV were most frequently detected in the first and second week. Dogs infected with CHV-1 were more likely to have severe respiratory disease, although severe respiratory disease itself might predispose dogs to the shedding of CHV-1. 10 Infection with CHV-1 was reported in association with fatal hepatic necrosis in an adult dog that lacked any evidence of immunosuppression. 15 Refer to Chapter 16 for information on CHV-1 infections in neonates.",

Influenza A viruses are classified based on the genetic composition of their hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes. To date, 16 H types and 9 N types have been identified, each of which are antigenically distinct. 16 The names of influenza viruses are specified as follows: influenza genus (A, B, or C)/host/geographic origin/strain number/year of isolation and, in parentheses, H and N type-for example, A/canine/Florida/43/2004 (H3N8). 17 Extensive genomic rearrangements that occur within influenza A viruses allow for occasional cross-species transmission among birds and mammals. These rearrangements occur when two different viruses simultaneously infect a host, with subsequent genetic reassortment. Occasionally, cross-species transmission occurs without alteration of the viral genome.",

            "text": "In the United States, CIV emerged in racing greyhounds in Florida in 2003 and 2004, 17 where it caused hemorrhagic pneumonia and a high mortality. However, serologic evidence of infection in the greyhound dog population dates back to 1999. 18 Infections spread slowly and were subsequently reported in racing greyhounds and non-greyhounds in at least 38 U.S. states. Outbreaks have continued to occur in shelter situations for nearly a decade after the virus was discovered. The virus that currently circulates in the United States is an H3N8 virus that closely resembles an equine influenza virus, which suggested that an interspecies jump occurred without genetic reassortment. 17 Instead, accumulation of point mutations with minor amino acid changes occurred, with sustained transmission among dogs. The most significant outbreaks of disease due to CIV have occurred in Florida, New England, Colorado, Wyoming, and Texas. In many other states, sustained transmission of the virus from one dog to another has not occurred. The most significant risk factor for infection has been indoor housing. 19 Virtually all cases to date have involved dogs in kennels, animal shelters, or dog daycare facilities. Dogs of all ages and breeds are susceptible, but to date severe hemorrhagic pneumonia has occurred only in greyhounds. 20 The virus is shed for up to 7 to 10 days. CIV has retained the ability to infect horses, but horses develop only mild disease or no clinical signs. 20 Avian-lineage H3N2 CIV emerged in South Korean dogs in 2007, and a similar virus was subsequently isolated from dogs in China. 21, 22 Experimentally, cats are also susceptible to infection by this virus. 23 Korean isolates were associated with epidemics of respiratory disease in kennels within veterinary clinics. 22 A novel H3N1 virus was also detected in South Korean dogs that lacked signs of respiratory disease. 24 A novel H5N2 influenza virus was recently detected in a dog with respiratory disease in China. 25 Dogs are susceptible to infection with human influenza virus H1N1 26, 27 and avian H5N1, 28 but sustained transmission of these viruses in the dog population has not been reported. Limited infection of dogs with equine H3N8 viruses was detected in hounds in England 29 and during an equine influenza outbreak in Australia. 30 In England, disease was so severe that several hounds had to be euthanized, and subacute bronchointerstitial pneumonia was detected at necropsy. 29 The Australian dogs developed inappetence, lethargy, nasal discharge, and a cough that persisted for several weeks, but dog-to-dog transmission was not identified. Experimental transmission of H3N8 influenza virus from horses to dogs was documented in Japan, but infected dogs did not show signs of illness. 31",

The virus infects dogs worldwide, replicates in epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, and often causes no signs or mild respiratory illness. Respiratory disease may be more severe when co-infections with other pathogens such as B. bronchiseptica are present. 33 Viremia seems to be uncommon, but occasionally CPiV has been isolated from the liver, spleen, and kidneys. A strain of CPiV was also isolated from a dog with neurologic signs. 34 There is some evidence that cats may be infected with CPiV or a closely related virus. 35 Virus is shed for up to 10 days after infection.",

CRCoV is a relatively newly identified cause of contagious respiratory disease in dogs. The virus is a group 2a coronavirus (family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus) and is distinct from canine enteric coronavirus, a group 1a coronavirus (Box 17-1). 39 Minimal serologic cross-reactivity exists between these two viruses. Group 2a coronaviruses possess a gene that encodes hemagglutinin esterase, an outer membrane protein glycoprotein. This gene is absent in group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. CRCoV is most closely related to a bovine coronavirus but also resembles human coronavirus OC43. 40 CRCoV was first reported in 2003, in a group of dogs with respiratory disease in a rehoming facility in England that had been vaccinated against CAV-2, CDV, and CPiV. 6, 40 Some of the dogs were co-infected with CPiV and CHV-1. 6 CRCoV spread rapidly and primarily was detected in the first week that dogs were introduced to the kennel, after which time CPiV and CHV-1 were detected. Alone, CRCoV causes subclinical infections or mild respiratory disease, but like human respiratory coronaviruses, it can cause reversible damage to, or loss of, the cilia on respiratory epithelial cells (Figure 17-1) . As a result, infected dogs are predisposed to secondary infections. Serologic evidence of exposure to CRCoV is widespread in dogs from North America, Great Britain and continental Europe, Japan, Korea, and New Zealand, 10, [41] [42] [43] and the virus has been detected widely using PCR-based methods in dogs with respiratory disease from many of these countries. To date, there is no evidence that cats can be infected with CRCoV.",

Collection of multiple specimen types from several dogs with and without clinical signs in an outbreak situation can facilitate diagnosis and allow interpretation of the significance of positive test results. Organism detection methods, such as PCR assays, are likely to be of highest yield early in the course of illness (e.g., the first 1 to 3 days) or in exposed dogs that have not yet developed clinical signs. Use of a combination of serology and organism detection methods also facilitates diagnosis. In shelter situations or outbreaks where severe disease occurs, necropsies can provide valuable information and should be performed by a veterinary pathologist as soon as possible after death or euthanasia. Tissues should be submitted for histopathology (in formalin), bacterial and virus cultures (fresh tissue), and PCR assay for respiratory viruses and bacteria (fresh or frozen tissue; see Chapter 5).",

For dogs with signs of respiratory disease that have been present for less than 7 to 10 days and that remain bright and appetent, no treatment is indicated. In some dogs, cough persists for as long as 10 to 30 days. Cough suppressants such as hydrocodone could be used for dogs with a nonproductive, honking cough that occurs throughout the day and night. Cough suppressants should not be used in dogs that have productive cough, because they suppress normal clearing mechanisms. Use of a harness or gentle leader for leash walking rather than a neck collar may also reduce cough. The efficacy and optimal dosage of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir (see Chapter 7) is unknown, and because of this and the fact that oseltamivir is a first-line treatment for pandemic influenza in humans, it should not be used to treat dogs with respiratory disease, even when CIV infection is present. For dogs with confirmed ocular CHV-1 infections that are associated with corneal ulceration, topical antiviral ophthalmic preparations such as idoxuridine or cidofovir could be considered (see Chapter 7) . 50 Antimicrobial drug treatment could be considered for dogs with signs that persist beyond 7 to 10 days, but is primarily indicated when there is evidence of secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia, such as pulmonary alveolar infiltrates and consolidation on thoracic radiography, lethargy, mucopurulent oculonasal discharges, and/or decreased appetite. Because antimicrobial drug resistance is increasingly reported among secondary bacterial pathogens and B. bronchiseptica, treatment of dogs with secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia is optimally based on the results of culture of a transtracheal wash specimen from each affected dog and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. For dogs with severe pneumonia, initial treatment should involve the use of broad-spectrum parenteral antimicrobial drugs such as a combination of a fluoroquinolone and a penicillin or clindamycin. When infection with B. bronchiseptica or Mycoplasma spp. is suspected, doxycycline may be the best first choice.

Vaccination against CIV is required for importation of North American dogs to Australia. 57 The initial vaccine can be given as early as 6 weeks of age. Because CIV vaccines are inactivated, two initial doses are required 3 to 4 weeks apart, and maximum immunity does not occur until 1 week after the second dose. As a result, CIV vaccines may not protect dogs that enter shelters where canine influenza is endemic, unless newly introduced dogs are separated from dogs that might be shedding CIV until immunization is complete. Annual boosters are recommended for dogs that remain at risk of infection, but the maximum duration of immunity is unknown.",

[58] [59] [60] One study showed that intranasal CPiV vaccination reduced clinical signs even when dogs were challenged as long as 1 year after immunization. 58 Few studies have compared the efficacy of parenteral and intranasal vaccines. In a study reported in the early 1980s, the parenteral vaccine was less effective at reducing shedding than the intranasal vaccine, 59 but a study reported in the 1970s showed reduction of clinical signs and shedding after parenteral vaccination. 61 The use of one parenteral CPiV vaccine resulted in antibody titers that persisted for at least 2 years. 62 Use of intranasal CPiV vaccines, as opposed to parenteral vaccines, has been advocated, because they produce local immunity, reduce shedding, and can be used in puppies as young as 3 to 4 weeks of age. 63 However, proper administration of mucosal vaccines may be difficult in aggressive dogs or dogs that refuse to be restrained. Mucosal vaccines may also be associated with transient respiratory illness for 3 to 10 days after immunization in a small percentage of dogs. This may be problematic in shelter and boarding environments, because these signs cannot be distinguished from those that result from natural infection with wild-type viruses. More studies that evaluate the relative efficacy of mucosal and parenteral CPiV vaccines are required.",

When factors such as stress, immunosuppression, co-infections, and overwhelming challenge doses are present, vaccine-induced protection may be overwhelmed. Prevention of transmissible respiratory tract disease in dogs therefore involves not only vaccination, but also control methods that include quarantine of dogs introduced into densely populated environments, early identification and isolation of dogs with signs of respiratory disease through proper training of shelter personnel, avoidance of overcrowding and mixing of dogs, use of solid walls between runs, reduction of time dogs spend in a shelter environment, optimum nutrition, fomite control, control of noise such as barking, and proper ventilation and disinfection (see . Distances traveled by aerosols generated by dogs are unknown. Dogs with respiratory disease should be separated from other dogs in shelter environments by at least 25 feet (or as far as possible) and ideally placed in an enclosed room with a separate ventilation system. Isolated dogs should not be moved back into the general shelter population, but adopted out of isolation or a separate recovery room. Provided proper cleaning and contact times are used, use of disinfectants with activity against parvovirus should also kill respiratory viruses, with CAV-2 being the respiratory virus that is most resistant to disinfection. The order of inspection of dogs in shelters should be healthy dogs, then quarantined dogs, and finally dogs in isolation.",

However, it is less likely to be successful for distemper and bordetellosis, which can have prolonged incubation and shedding periods. For some viral respiratory diseases such as canine influenza, discontinuation of intake and adoptions for 2 to 3 weeks may be necessary while the disease runs its course. Exposed dogs could also be transferred to foster care in a household with no other dogs.
