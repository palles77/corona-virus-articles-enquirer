However, the association between clinical, laboratory and CT characteristics and RT-PCR results is still unclear. We sought to examine this association in detail, especially in recovered patients.",

            "text": "An outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, and spread quickly across 114 countries around the world. On 11 March 2020, the Word Health Organization(WHO) made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic because we have now surpassed 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide, with more than 4,000 deaths [1, 2] . According to the recommended guidelines, approximately 22,888 patients were discharged in China after two consecutive negative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid [3, 4] . Until now, there has been no adequate, approved, or available alternative to the emergency use of RT-PCR for diagnosing COVID-19. Thus, nucleic acid testing plays an important and key role in the diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making in COVID-19. Apart from the RT-PCR results, new coronavirus pneumonia has been observed in approximately 76.4% of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients on chest CT images [5] . Although the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and CT characteristics of COVID-19 have been well documented, their association with RT-PCR results is still unclear [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Recently, follow-up examinations have found that few patients have positive RT-PCR results after recovery [12] . However, the follow-up of recovered patients has been limited to date. We sought to assess the association between RT-PCR results and the clinical, laboratory and radiological features of COVID-19 patients. Specifically, we evaluated the clinical characteristics of patients with re-positive RT-PCT test results after recovery from COVID-19.",

Our inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR results [13] and (2) patients who were discharged from the hospital with standard treatment after having two consecutive negative RT-PCR results based on the sixth guidelines of the CDC in China [4] . Patients who died or were not discharged were excluded. The institutional ethics board of our institutes approved this study (No. 2020.43). All patients were orally informed that their clinical data would be used to perform this research to contribute to the deeper understanding of COVID-19 and that their private information would be strictly confidential. The RT-PCR results after recovery from COVID-19 were tracked, and the due date was Feb 29, 2020.",

Most importantly, after obtaining negative RT-PCR results, 2/18 (11.1%) patients demonstrated segmental progression on CT, and their RT-PCR results were positive again after discharge (9 days and 10 days). 5) Of 52 discharged patients, 7 patients had re-positive RT-PCR results 9 to 17 days after discharge, of whom two were found to have new GGO, and the remaining 5 patients improved compared with the CT findings with negative RT-PCR results.

            "text": "Human coronavirus mainly affects the respiratory system and causes mild to moderate respiratory symptoms (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoVOC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). Although the sequence of 2019-nCoV is relatively different from that of two other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) that threatened public health in 2003 and 2012[14,15], they may share similarities regarding pathogenesis. Chemokines and cytokines might play a key role in human coronavirus infection. Indirect evidence shows that in the second phase of SARS-CoV infection, high fever, obvious progression of pneumonia and hypoxemia occur despite a significant decline in virus titres [16] . In addition, previous research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV directly revealed that pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL12, TGF\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL10, and IL8) in serum increased considerably, and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) decreased in severe patients [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . A similar phenomenon was observed, in which pro-inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 increased and ICU patients had much higher plasma concentrations [6] . Cytokine storms and immunopathology via the dysregulation of chemokines and cytokines may cause epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis, vascular leakage, and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils, which induce severe lung injuries [25, 26] . Similarly, our study demonstrated that a few COVID-19 patients had sustainable increases in CRP levels and decreases in lymphocyte counts, and most patients' CT images demonstrated progression before the RT-PCR results became negative, which suggests that these patients may suffer from inflammatory storms and lymphatic system (especially T lymphocyte) injuries caused by the virus [7] . In addition, the serum levels of these chemokines and cytokines might remain elevated and lead to an inflammatory response even with negative RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2[17], which may be the reason for the progression of radiographical signs in 2 of our patients (Figure 1 and Figure S2 ) and the fact that almost half of the patients still had higher CRP levels after obtaining negative RT-PCR results.",

Research on SARS-CoV has demonstrated that after 60 days of recovery from SARS-CoV, inflammatory factors are still higher than in normal controls, pneumonia still exists in the lungs, and complete resolution may not occur until 90 days or later [17] . Thus, for COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital, regular follow-up with laboratory tests and CT imaging are essential for monitoring inflammation progression and reduction, and sufficient nutrition support is necessary to help repair inflammatory injury. Previous radiographic studies have shown that the majority of COVID-19 patients have similar CT characteristics, such as GGO, consolidation, and fibrosis [9] [10] [11] . In improved patients, fibrosis or resolution of exudation is detected; however, new lesions or additional consolidated primary lesions are found in progressed patients.",

In these 7 patients, the chest CT results of 2 re-positive patients showed that the lung lesions had deteriorated compared with the chest CT results before obtaining negative RT-PCR results; one of these patients had new lesions in the lung on follow-up chest CT when readmitted to the hospital due to re-positive RT-PCR results. Our results demonstrate that even with negative RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal swabs, patients with lesion progression on CT images should be given more attention. This phenomenon may be due to two reasons: one is that a proportion of recovered patients may still carry the virus; thus, close observation and quarantine is needed for two weeks after discharge [12] . Based on these considerations, isolation for 14 days has been added to the 6th guidelines issued by China's National Health Commission [4] . Another reason may be that all our patients underwent nasopharyngeal swabs to test for SARS-CoV-2, which may have provided false-negative results due to sampling bias. Therefore, two rounds of negative RT-PCR results should not be recommended as the only criteria for COVID-19 recovery; the combination with dynamic chest CT is essential, as mentioned in the sixth edition of the COVID-19 patient management guidelines [4] . Additionally, for these patients with negative RT-PCR results but CT progression, deep sampling, such as lower respiratory tract or faecal sampling, is required to ensure that negative RT-PCR results are accurate. According to our research and the latest literature[27], chest CT plays a critical role in the evaluation of NCP progression as well as follow-up after RT-PCR results become negative; thus, chest CT findings should be considered as part of the standard criteria for discharge and management. In the future, more effort should be made to investigate virus retention, CT outcomes and the clinical prognosis of COVID-19. This study has some limitations. First, we had a relatively small number of recovered patients, including only 18 of 52 patients with three follow-up CT images. Second, the time of follow-up was relatively short, and the full outcome of the RT-PCR results may be limited to some extent. Third, the results of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL12, TGF\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3) and chemokines (CCL2, CXCL10, and IL8) were lacking, and more evidence is needed regarding the sustainable inflammatory condition of COVID-19 after obtaining negative RT-PCR results. Thus, further investigations considering the abovementioned limitations are required.",
