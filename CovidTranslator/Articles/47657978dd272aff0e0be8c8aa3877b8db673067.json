However, the capacity of VSV-based vaccines to induce mucosal immunity has not been fully investigated. In the present study, a recombinant VSV expressing coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) major immunogen VP1 has been generated and the immune protection elicited by VSV-VP1 was evaluated. We demonstrated that intranasal delivery of VSV-VP1 can induce a potent antigen-specific mucosal immune response as well as a systemic immune response, particularly the induction of polyfunctional T cells. Importantly, mice immunized with VSV-VP1 were better protected against CVB3-induced viral myocarditis than those receiving a chitosan-formulated DNA vaccine. Increased dendritic cell (DC) maturation in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) was observed in the mice vaccinated with VSV-VP1, which could be a potential mechanism for the protective immune response. These findings support VSV as a viral delivery vector that can induce robust mucosal immunity that should be considered for further vaccine development.",

Agammaglobulinemic individuals are particularly susceptible to CVB3-associated encephalitis, and mice lacking B cells develop a chronic infection and remain viremic for at least 2 months; viremia can be alleviated by the adoptive transfer of B cells from CVB3immune wild-type mice [17] [18] [19] . Reports have also highlighted the importance of cellular immunity against CVB3-induced viral myocarditis. Comparison of C57BL/6 mice (resistant to chronic CVB3 myocarditis) and A.BY/SnJ mice (susceptible to chronic CVB3 myocarditis) found that a failure to clear the virus may be attributed to defects in dendritic cell (DC) maturation/activation and MHC class I antigen processing [20] . The neutralization of interleukin 17 (IL-17) increases both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, which ameliorates the pathological cardiac changes and reduces viral replication [21] .",

Thus, it is important for a CVB3 vaccine to produce mucosal immunity at the sites of viral transmission to block the initial infection as well as the induction of potent systemic immune responses. A multitude of vehicles, including http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.05.052 0264-410X/\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. microparticles, liposomes, and attenuated pathogens, have been developed as alternative platforms for mucosal delivery. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a viral vaccine vector, has been shown to be an excellent vector to deliver foreign antigens [22, 23] . Using reverse genetics, an exogenous gene can be inserted into the VSV genome and recombinant VSV can be recovered entirely from an infectious cDNA clone [24, 25] . The exogenous antigen is expressed continuously in vivo once the recombinant viruses are inoculated into animals, and thus it triggers specific immune responses. Recombinant VSV has been successfully developed for a number of vaccine candidates, such as human immunodeficiency virus [26] [27] [28] [29] , severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [30, 31] , hepatitis C virus [32, 33] , hepatitis B virus [34] , influenza virus [35] , papillomavirus [36] , human respiratory syncytial virus [37] , poxvirus [38] , Ebola virus, and Marburg virus [39, 40] . The VSV-based HIV vaccine candidate has been so successful in early studies that it has recently been moved to clinical study through the HIV Vaccine Design and Development Teams program [41] . Collectively, these studies have demonstrated the great potential of VSV-based vaccines to trigger strong immunity even after a single immunizing dose. In spite of this, the capacity of VSV-based vaccines to induce mucosal immunity has not yet been fully characterized.",

Detection of serum creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB activity reflects the amount of cardiac damage. Immunization with VSV-VP1 significantly reduced the serum CK and CK-MB activity ( Fig. 4B and C) . For example, CK-MB in the VSV-VP1 immunized group was only 631.3 IU/L, while it was 1420.0 IU/L in the VSV-GFP immunized group. Additionally, the viral titer of heart tissue in the VSV-VP1 immunized group was at least 250-fold lower than that of the VSV-GFP immunized group (Fig. 4D ). Histology analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained heart sections showed a large amount of myocyte necrosis and immune-infiltration in the control (PBS), VSV-GFP and chito-pcDNA3.1 immunized groups. Only a tiny amount of inflammation was seen in the VSV-VP1 immunized group, suggesting that this vaccination prevented the development of myocarditis (Fig. 4E) .

Single-positive CD4 + or CD8 + T cells expressing IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423, or IL-2 was significantly increased in the VSV-VP1 immunization group (4.64% for CD4 + IFN-\u2425 + , 16.48% for CD4 + IL-2 + and 23.04% for CD4 + TNF-\u2423 + ) upon VP1 peptide stimulation and was significantly higher than those in the chito-pcDNA3.1-VP1 immunization group.

Analysis of IFN-\u2425 + TNF-\u2423 + , IFN-\u2425 + IL-2 + , and TNF-\u2423 + IL-2 + double-positive CD4 + T cells revealed that the proportion of IFN-\u2425 + IL-2 + cells was the lowest (1.69% for the VSV-VP1 immunized group and 0.88% for the chito-pcDNA3.1-VP1immunized group). TNF-\u2423 + IL-2 + double-positive T cells were the most abundant, reaching 18.10% for the VSV-VP1 immunized group and 7.92% for the chito-pcDNA3.1-VP1 immunized group.

Although VSV-based vectors have been widely used as vaccine platforms, few studies have characterized the capacity of VSV-based vaccines to induce potent mucosal immunity. We compared the antigen-specific mucosal immunity elicited by intranasal administration of a VSV-VP1 vaccine with that of a chitosan-based mucosal vaccine, chitosan-pcDNA3.1-VP1 [14] . With a single-dose intranasal delivery of VSV-VP1, mice exhibited significantly higher levels of both mucosal and systemic immune responses than mice vaccinated with chito-pcDNA3.1-VP1. This improvement in multiple aspects of immunity is one of the most important virtues of mucosal vaccination [43] . While the peak levels of antigen-specific fecal sIgA in the VSV-VP1 and chito-pcDNA3.1-VP1 groups were similar, the induction of antigen-specific sIgA in the VSV-VP1 immunized group was much faster than that in the chito-pcDNA3.1-VP1 immunized group. Since the same antigen, VP1, was used for both delivery systems in this study, these results demonstrate that the VSV-based vector is more potent at inducing mucosal immunity than the chitosan-based delivery system. The increased protection against viral myocarditis in VSV-VP1 immunized mice may result from the elevated humoral response as well as the cellular immunity comparing to that of chito-pcDNA3.1-VP1.",

Because the gastrointestinal tract is the main route through which CVB3 invades the host, it is critical to induce mucosal immune responses that can block virus infection at the initial stage and the primary site. Second, being a virus, VSV can induce strong cellular immunity to compensate the impaired cellular immunity after CVB3 infection. Kemball et al. found that CVB3 infection rapidly induces phenotypic changes in conventional DC, and markedly impairs specific CD8 + T cell antigen presentation through MHCI pathway in vivo [48, 49] . Third, the VSV reverse genetics system is well characterized and easy to manipulate [24, 25] . High titers of recombinant VSV can be achieved by propagating virus in mammalian cell lines approved for vaccine production. Compared with other potential vaccine platforms such as baculovirus, the VSV system is faster and less expensive. Finally, VSV vaccines can be administered needle-free. This is especially valuable for people who live in rural regions that are short of health care.",

For HCV, it was reported that the resolution obtained under early interferon therapy correlated with the development of polyfunctional IFN-\u2425/IL-2/CD107\u2423 + specific CD8 + T cells [51] . While the chito-pcDNA3.1-VP1 vaccine could induce some polyfunctional T cells (1.52% triple-positive IFN-\u2425 + TNF-\u2423 + IL-2 + CD4 + T cells), immunization with VSV-VP1 resulted in the striking increase of this population up to 4.28%. In addition, the VSV-VP1 vaccine induced up to 18.10% double-positive TNF-\u2423 + IL-2 + CD4 + T cells.

Viral vectors, such as recombinant adenovirus 35, that can efficiently infect and cause maturation of DC in vivo induce optimal vaccine responses [52] . As previously described in vitro for BMDC [53, 54] , we observed that VSV infection significantly improved the maturation of MLN DC through the up-regulation of different molecules 2 weeks post-final immunization. One reason for this might be that the stimulation caused by VSV infection is stronger and lasts longer than that caused by chitosan-incorporated DNA at the sites of immunization. The increased maturation of MLN DC in VSV-VP1immunized mice likely results from the sustained migration and activation of peripheral DC from the inoculation site.
