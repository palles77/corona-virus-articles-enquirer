Brefeldin A (BFA) was shown in earlier studies of numerous cell types to inhibit secretion, induce enzymes of the Golgi stacks to redistribute into the ER, and to cause the Golgi cisternae to disappear. Here, we demonstrate that the PtKt line of rat kangaroo kidney cells is resistant to BFA. The drug did not disrupt the morphology of the Golgi complex in PtKt cells, as judged by immunofluorescence using antibodies to 58-(58K) and l l0-kD (B-COP) Golgi proteins, and by fluorescence microscopy of live cells labeled with C6-NBD-ceramide. In addition, BFA did not inhibit protein secretion, not alter the kinetics or extent of glycosylation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G-protein) in VSV-infected PtKt cells. To explore the mechanism of resistance to BFA, PtKt cells were fused with BFA-sensitive CV-1 cells that had been infected with a recombinant SV-40 strain containing the gene for VSV G-protein and, at various times following fusion, the cultures were exposed to BFA. Shortly after cell fusion, heterokaryons contained one Golgi complex associated with each nu-cleus. Golgi membranes derived from CV-1 cells were sensitive to BFA, whereas those of PtKt origin were BFA resistant. A few hours after fusion, most heterokaryons contained a single, large Golgi apparatus that was resistant to BFA and contained CV-1 galactosyltransferase. In unfused cells that had been perforated using nitrocellulose filters, retention of/3-COP on the Golgi was optimal in the presence of cytosol, ATP, and GTE In perforated cell models of the BFAsensitive MA104 line, BFA caused 3-COP to be released from the Golgi complex in the presence of nucleotides, and either MA104 or PtK~ cytosol. In contrast, when perforated PtKl cells were incubated with BFA, nucleotides, and cytosol from either cell type, ~-COP remained bound to the Golgi complex. We conclude that PtKl cells contain a nondiffusible factor, which is located on or very close to the Golgi complex, and confers a dominant resistance to BFA. It is possible that this factor is homologous to the target of BFA in cells that are sensitive to the drug.",

            "text": "T rIE Golgi apparatus comprises a series of membranous compartments in which proteins are modified posttranslationally and sorted so that each is targeted to an appropriate cellular membrane. To fulfill these tasks, the Golgi complex is divided into several structurally and functionally distinct regions through which proteins successively pass: the cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi cisternae, and the trans-Golgi network (Farquhar, 1985; Griffiths and Simons, 1986) . Maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi complex and its various compartments represents a significant challenge for the cell because large quantities of protein and lipid regularly pass between the Golgi complex and other membranous organelles. For example, proteins destined for processing in the Golgi network are exported from the ER along with more numerous resident ER proteins. This process occurs by a mechanism that concentrates the former proteins 5-10-fold in the Golgi complex, while efficiently returning the ER proteins to their normal place of residence (Green et al., 1981; Griffiths et al., 1984; Warren 1987; Pelham, 1989 ). An equally important feature of this process is that proteins which perform their functions in the Golgi complex are selectively retained within the Golgi complex. Thus, the exchange of membrane components between the ER and the Golgi membrane is opposed by at least two concentration gradients, one favoring escape of abundant ER proteins into Golgi membranes that lack them, and another favoring absorption of Golgi membrane constituents into the ER.",

One of these sorting steps is accomplished during the formation of transport vesicles that emanate from the ER (Palade, 1975; Bergmann and Singer, 1983) , while another occurs in an immunologically distinct compartment juxtaposed to the Golgi complex (Seraste and Kuismanen, 1984; Tooze et al., 1984; Warren, 1987; Schweizer et al., 1988; Pelham, 1989) . This intermediate compartment has been proposed to segregate \"escaped\" ER proteins from proteins which proceed through the secretory pathway. As a result, component proteins of the ER can be recycled from the intermediate compartment back to the ER, while proteins that require further posttranslational modifications can be transported to cis-Golgi cisternae. It seems likely that these protein sorting events are coupled to the formation of vesicles derived from the intermediate compartment, and that some of the vesicles fuse selectively with the ER, while others merge specifically with the cis-Golgi membrane (reviewed in Pelham, 1989) . In principle, such a mechanism could prevent the flow of Golgi membranes into the intermediate compartment, and by extension, into the ER.",

            "text": "Further insight into the mechanism for preventing Golgi proteins from escaping into the ER has been gained recently through studies of the fungal metabolite, brefeldin A (BFA) t. Treatment of cultured cells with BFA was found to cause resident Golgi proteins to redistribute into the ER by a mechanism that requires energy and intact microtubules (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990) . Moreover, the application of BFA to cultured cells has provided evidence that the pathway for membrane flow between the ER and Golgi membrane contains the aforementioned ER recycling arm, which is otherwise difficult to detect (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990) . Based on these and related findings (Fujiwara et al., 1988; Doms et al., 1989; Ulmer and Palade, 1989; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990) , it has been proposed that BFA acts through a specific molecular target and directly inhibits only one aspect of membrane traffic (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990) . If BFA does, indeed, inactivate a specific Golgi target that plays a critical role in maintaining the separate identity of Golgi membranes, then BFA-treated cells may be as useful for understanding the control of intracellular protein traffic in animal cells as mutant strains have been for unravelling the secretory pathway in yeast. As of now, however, the hypothesis that BFA acts directly on a single intracellular target and exerts a limited number of specific effects has been supported mainly by the observations that BFA does not alter cellular ATP levels, protein synthesis, or endocytosis, and affects cells at submicromolar concentrations (Misumi et al., 1986; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990) .",

In this report, we present evidence that the Golgi apparatus in the rat kangaroo kidney cell line, PtKI, is unaffected structurally or functionally by BFA. The resistance of PtK~ cells to BFA cannot be explained by an inability of the drug to enter the ceils, or by the sequestration or inactivation of BFA once it gains access to the cytoplasm. Instead, in PtKt cells the Golgi complex itself, or a compartment directly adjacent to the Golgi apparatus appears to contain a dominant, nondiffusible factor that confers resistance to BFA. This factor may represent a BFA-insensitive version of the molecule which serves as the target for BFA in other cell types.",

For immunofluorescence, all antibodies were diluted into PBS containing 1% BSA. Anti-58K was used in purified form at 10/~g/ml. Other primary antibodies were in the form of polyclonal antisera and monoclonal ascites fluids. These were diluted 1:200, except for anti-Gai T, which was used at a 1:50 dilution. Fluorescent second antibodies were used at 5/~g/mi. Cells growing on No. 1 thickness coverslips were washed twice with PBS containing 1 mM MgC12 and 0.1 mM CaCI2, and then were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.2 for 10 rain at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were rinsed once with DME and incubated with DME for 10 additional min to inactivate free aldehyde groups. The cells were then permeabilized by a 5-rain incubation in methanol at -20\"C, after which they were subjected to the following successive incubations at room temperature: (a) 30 min in 1% BSA in PBS; (b) 45 rain (for double labeling) or 1 h (for single labeling) in primary antibodies; (c) 3 x 5' each in 1% BSA/PBS; (d) 1 h in fluorescently labeled second antibodies; (e) 3 x 10' in 1% BSA/PBS. The coverslips were then mounted onto glass slides using Mowiol (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). The specimens were viewed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using a 63 x planapo objecfive, and photographed on TMAX 3,200 film (Eastman Kodak Corp.; Rochester, NY), which was processed with TMAX developer for an effective film speed of E1 800.",

Fig. 1 presents micrographs of PtK1 and CV-1 cells that were cultured in the presence or absence of BFA, and labeled for immunofluorescence with mAbs directed against two proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus. One of these is a 58 kD, cytoplasmicaUy oriented, peripheral membrane component of the Golgi apparatus. This protein, known as \"58K\" binds directly to microtubules and has been proposed to be involved in anchoring the Golgi apparatus to microtubules in vivo (Bloom and Brashear, 1989) . The other protein, a ll0-kD species (Alan and Kreis, 1986), was recently shown to dissociate from the Golgi apparatus in cultured cells within 30 s of BFA exposure (Donaldson et al., 1990) , and to bear significant homology to the clathrinassociated protein, 5-adaptin (Duden et al., 1991) .

After CV-1 cells were exposed for 30 min to 1.8/~M (0.5 /zg/ml) BFA, the localization of/~-COP and 58K was altered, as both proteins appeared to be dispersely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (B and D). Recent evidence suggests that BFA exerts distinct effects on these two proteins, causing a redistribution of 58K into the ER and solubilization of/~-COP (Donaldson et al., 1990) . Neither of these effects were observed in BFA-treated PtK~ cells.

When BFA was of PtK] and CV-1 cells were pulse labeled for 10 min at 37\u00b0C with 3H-leucine or 35S-methionine, and then chased with unlabeled amino acids for 1 h at 37 \u00b0 C or on ice. When BFA was used it was present throughout the entire pulse and chase period. After the chase, TCA-precipitable counts were measured in 75-/zl aliquots of tissue culture media, duplicate samples of which were measured in all cases. Levels of protein secretion were determined by subtracting the TCA-precipitable counts produced by cultures that had been chased on ice (background counts) from the counts yielded by cultures that had been chased at 37\u00b0C, but were otherwise identical. Shown here are the normalized results from three sets of experiments, two of which used aH-leucine and the other of which was performed using 35S-methionine. Percent secretion refers to counts secreted by cells cultured in the presence of 1.8 or 36/zM (0.5 or 10/zg/ml) BFA compared to counts secreted by control cells. In 75-#1 aliquots of tissue culture medium, control CV-I ceils typically yielded '~25,000 cpm of background-corrected, secreted protein when 3SS-methionine was used, and \",d,000 cpm with 3H-leucine. For control PtKt cells, the values were ,~12,000 cpm with 3~S and ,~400 cpm with 3H. As is evident in the graph shown here, BFA inhibited secretion in CV-1 cells by '~80-90%, but the drug did not suppress secretion in PtK1 ceils. VSV, pulse labeled with 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine, and chased with an excess of unlabeled amino acids. After each chase period, the cells were lysed and VSV G protein was immunoprecipitated and digested with endo H. When present, BFA was added to 36 ttM (10 #g/ml) 30 min before the 35S pulse began, and remained in the medium throughout the entire pulse and chase. Shown here are fluorographs of two SDS-polyacrylamide gels on which several such samples were analyzed. Note that in the absence of BFA and after a 15-min chase, a portion of the VSV G protein in CV-1 cells resisted digestion by endo H, and that all VSV G protein gained resistance by 90 min of chase. When BFA was present, endo H resistance was not detected by 90 min of chase. In contrast, the VSV G protein in PtK~ cells acquired partial and complete resistance to endo H by 15 and 90 min of chase, respectively, in either the absence or presence of BFA. This indicated that in PtK~ cells BFA failed to inhibit Golgi-dependent conversion of the VSV G protein from a high mannose to a complex carbohydrate form. The numbers at the bottom of this figure refer to gel lanes, as mentioned in the text.",

This was accomplished by infecting PtK~ cells with VSV, and monitoring the susceptibility of the VSV-encoded transmembrane G protein to digestion by endo H. The loss of endo H sensitivity marks the maturation of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides to complex forms by a process that occurs within the medial Golgi stacks (reviewed in Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) . Previously reported experiments using CHO cells had demonstrated that BFA caused a 45-90 min delay in the acquisition of endo H-resistant oligosaccharides by the VSV G protein, and that redistribution of Golgi enzymes to the ER, rather than movement of substrate to the Golgi apparatus, led to the eventual processing of the VSV G protein (Doms et al., 1989) . In the present case, parallel cultures of PtKt and CV-1 cells were infected with VSV and pulsed with 3~S-labeled amino acids. For each cell type, samples were incubated in both the presence and absence of BFA throughout a constant radiolabeling period and a variable chase interval. At the end of each chase interval, VSV G protein was immunoprecipitated, digested with endo H and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. As illustrated in Fig. 4 , the VSV G protein produced in both cell types in the absence of BFA acquired partial resistance to endo H by 15 rain of chase and was fully resistant after a 90-min chase (lanes 4 and 6). A time-dependent, progressive increase in endo H resistance was observed at intermediate time points, and was indistinguishable for the two cell types (data not shown). However, in the presence of 36/zM (10 #g/ml) BFA, a dramatic difference between the two cell types was noted. In PtK~ cells, the VSV G protein produced under these conditions acquired resistance to endo H with kinetics identical to the untreated cells (lanes 10 and 12). In contrast, by 90 min of chase the VSV G protein produced in BFA-treated CV-1 cells was still totally sensitive to endo H (lane 12). As expected, some resistance to endo H was seen in the CV-1 cells at later times of chase (data not shown).",

In agreement with our previous observations (Figs. 1 and 2) , bright staining of a morphologically intact Golgi apparatus was ob-served using both antibodies (data not shown).

For example, the cells may have failed to import BFA, they might have actively exported BFA before the drug exerted its effects, or they could have lowered the concentration of BFA in the cytoplasm by sequestering or degrading it. Alternatively, PtK~ cells may have been resistant to BFA by one of several mechanisms that could be useful for investigating the molecular basis for the effects of the drug. For instance, perhaps PtKI cells lacked the target for BFA, possessed a BFA-insensitive version of the target, or contained a factor that somehow interfered with the action of BFA. To attempt to distinguish among these possibilities, PtK~ cells were fused to CV-1 cells and the resulting heterokaryons were tested for resistance to BFA. The CV-1 cells used in these experiments were infected with a recombinant SV-40 vector containing the gene for the VSV G protein, which was known from earlier studies to act as a potent cell-cell fusogen below pH 6.0 (White et al., 1981; Rothman et al., 1984) .",

The PtK~ cells were then chased in the absence of FITC-dextran for 24 h, during which time the lysosomes containing FITCdextran collected in a perinuclear region. The SV-40-infected CV-1 cells were then added to the culture and allowed to attach overnight. At the end of this incubation period, the fusogenic pH 5.5 wash was administered to some cultures, but not to others, and the cultures were incubated for several more minutes.

It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that heterokaryons corresponded to those syncytia that contained both BFA-resistant and sensitive Golgi complexes, which originated in PtKm and CV-1 cells, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 6 , most detectable Golgi complexes in heterokaryons were stained not only by anti-58K, but by anti-VSV G protein, as well. Staining by the latter antibody indicated that VSV G protein, which was provided to the heterokaryons by CV-1 cells, was able to enter Golgi complexes supplied to the syncytia by PtKt cells within 30 rain after cell fusion. There has been a prior report of heterologous ER to Golgi transport in heterokaryons within this time frame, although homologous transport can be detected much earlier (Valtersson et al., 1990) . It is also worth noting that while cells in Figs. 5 and 6 were stained with anti-VSV G protein, labeled Golgi complexes can be found only in the latter figure. This is because the cells in Fig. 6 , but not those in Fig. 5 , were permeabilized before being stained with the antibody to VSV G protein.",

To address this issue, we used a polyclonal antibody that was made against human milk Gal T, and stains the Golgi complexes by immunofluorescence in CV-1, but not PtK~ cells (Fig. 8, A and B) . Cultures that had been allowed to recover in normal pH medium for 1.5 h after fusion and were then treated with 36 #M (10/zg/ml) BFA for an additional 30 min were stained for double immtmofluorescence with anti-Gal T and a mAb specific for VSV G protein.

It seems clear that the BFA-resistant, Gal T-positive Golgi complexes found in cells >/1.5 h after fusion represented a merger of Golgi components derived from both PtKl and CV-1 cells. Within such merged Golgi complexes, the PtK~ phenotype of BFA resistance was dominant over the CV-1 cell phenotype of BFA sensitivity. 30 min after fusion, though, when the Golgi complexes in syncytia were still separate, heterokaryons contained both BFA-resistant and -sensitive Golgi apparatuses. These collective observations are not compatible with models stipulating that PtK~ cells are unable to accumulate pharmacologically active BFA, or contain a cytosolic factor which abrogates the effects of the drug. Instead, the data indicate that PtK~ cells contain a nondiffusible factor which is tightly associated with the Golgi complex or a nearby compartment, and which confers resistance to BFA.

Heterokaryons were generated as in Fig. 5 and 6 and incubated with 36 #M (10 #g/ml) BFA for 30 min beginning 3 h after fusion. The ceils were then fixed, perrneabilized, and stained for double immunofluorescence using mouse monoclonal anti-58K and rabbit polyclonal anti-VSV G protein followed by Texas red-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and FITC-labeled goat antirabbit IgG. Shown here are corresponding FITC (A and C) and Texas red (B and D) micrographs of two heterokaryons which contained merged, BFAresistant Golgi complexes. Bar, 10 #m. using nitrocellulose membranes. MA104 ceils were observed to behave identically to CV-1 cells in all of the fusion experiments previously described (data not shown), but were superior to the CV-1 cells for the perforation experiments because they adhered to the coverslips more tightly. The perforated cells were found to be readily permeable to macromolecules, such as IgG, because cytoplasmic antigens could be stained by immunofluorescence methods following fixation with formaldehyde, without the need for additional permeabilization steps. Parallel cultures of unperforated cells remained completely unstained when processed in an otherwise identical manner (data not shown). The standard design of these experiments was to perforate cells, incubate them in the presence or absence of BFA for 30 min, and then fiX. Following fixation, the cell models were stained for immunofluorescence using the monoclonal antibody to/S-COP. This antibody was chosen because removal of/S-COP from Golgi membranes can be detected in cells sensitive to BFA less than 1 min after their initial exposure to the drug (Donaldson et al., 1990) . This phenomenon is the earliest known effect of BFA, and we reasoned, therefore, that it might be one of the easiest BFA-dependent events to duplicate in a cell model system. A very similar approach was used recently to implicate a GTP-15inding protein in maintaining the association of ~COP with the Golgi membranes in perforated cells (Donaldson et al., 1991) .",

Initially, we extended this basic observation in four principal directions. First, virtually identical results were obtained when PtK1 cells were exposed to BFA concentrations at least 100-fold greater than that required for complete dissolution of the Golgi apparatus in sensitive cells. Secondly, similar results were obtained using two additiona! antibodies, one directed against another Golgi-associated protein, ~COP (ll0-kD protein; Alan and Kreis, 1986; Duden et al., 1991; Serafini et al., 1991) , and the other specific for the VSV G protein. Next, fluorescence microscopy of PtK1 cells treated with the vital Golgi stain, Ct-NBD-ceramide, demonstrated once again that the Golgi apparatus in this cell line remains intact in the presence of high concentrations of BFA. Finally, we found that in PtK1 cells BFA did not inhibit two major Golgi-dependent activities, secretion, and conversion of newly synthesized glycoprotein from high mannose to complex carbohydrate forms. Taken together, these observa-tions indicated that both morphological and functional properties of the Golgi complex are resistant to BFA in the PtK~ cell line.",

This allowed us to ask, in essence, a genetic question about such heterokaryons: in the presence of BFA, would the phenotype of either cell type be dominant over the other or, during the period when the Golgi complexes remained separate, would each respond to the drug as it would have in an unfused cell? Each of the three potential outcomes would have indicated a unique set of possible mechanisms for the BFA resistance of PtK~ cells. In actuality, when syncytia were treated with BFA immediately after fusion, each Golgi complex behaved independently as it would have in an unfused cell. Approximately 20% of the multinucleate cells contained both BFA-resistant and -sensitive Golgi complexes. Based on their frequency, it is likely that these cells represented the entire heterokaryon population (Table I) , and it is noteworthy that we never observed syncytia in which all Golgi complexes were resistant to BFA. These results indicate that the PtKI Golgi remains intact even when it is in direct contact with biologically active levels of BFA, and virtually eliminate the possibility that PtK~ cells produce a diffusible, cytosolic factor which provides resistance to BFA.",

To circumvent this limitation, experiments were performed using cells in which the plasma membranes were perforated with nitrocellulose, an approach that has proven to be useful for studying a variety of steps in intracellular membrane traffic (Beckers et al., 1987; Bennett et al., 1988; Beckers and Balch, 1989; Simons and Verta, 1989; Smythe et al., 1989; Podbilowicz and Mellman, 1990) . In these experiments, as in another recent study conducted elsewhere (Donaldson et al., 1991) , the focus was on the earliest known effect of BFA, the removal of/3-COP from the Golgi complex (Donaldson et al., 1990) . We found that the addition of BFA to an incubation buffer containing ATP, GTP, and buffered autologous cytosol induced the release of/~-COP from the Golgi complex in perforated MA104 cells. This effect was not prevented by replacing MA104 cytosol with a sizable excess of PtK~ cell cytosol, nor was B-COP driven from the Golgi complex by BFA in perforated PtKI cells that had been incubated with either PtK~ or MA104 cytosol. Since these experiments entailed the use of a large excess of cytosol isolated from a single source, it is evident that soluble, cytosolic factors cannot make a BFA-sensitive Golgi resistant to the drug, or convert a BFA-resistant Golgi to a drug-sensitive state. The perforated cell results thus support two fundamental conclusions of the fused cell studies: (a) a nondiffusible factor located on or very near the Golgi complex provides PtK~ cells with resistance to BFA; and (b) a specific molecular target for BFA is similarly localized in other types.",

Heterokaryons were formed by plating CV-1 cells that had been infected with an SV-40 strain containing the gene for VSV G protein onto monolayers of PtKt cells, and briefly exposing the mixed cell cultures to pH 5.5. The PtKl cells in this case had been labeled earlier with FITC-dextran, which entered the cells by fluid-phase endocytosis and eventually accumulated in lysosomes. VSV G protein located on the plasma membrane was detected by staining fixed, unpermeabilized cells with rabbit polyclonal anti-VSV G protein followed by TRITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Corresponding phase contrast (transmined light) and fluorescein and rhodamine epifluorescence images are shown. Appreciable cell fusion occurred only when the acid wash was included (.4, C, and E). When the acid wash was omitted, multinucleated cells were not observed (B, D, and F). Bar, 10 ~m.",
