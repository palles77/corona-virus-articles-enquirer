            "text": "Viruses depend on their hosts at every stage of their life cycles and must therefore communicate with them via Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs). To investigate the mechanisms of communication by different viruses, we overlay reported pairwise human-virus PPIs on human signalling pathways. Of 671 pathways obtained from NCI and Reactome databases, 355 are potentially targeted by at least one virus. The majority of pathways are linked to more than one virus. We find evidence supporting the hypothesis that viruses often interact with different proteins depending on the targeted pathway. Pathway analysis indicates overrepresentation of some pathways targeted by viruses. The merged network of the most statistically significant pathways shows several centrally located proteins, which are also hub proteins. Generally, hub proteins are targeted more frequently by viruses. Numerous proteins in virus-targeted pathways are known drug targets, suggesting that these might be exploited as potential new approaches to treatments against multiple viruses.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases cause millions of deaths every year. New infectious diseases appear regularly in diverse parts of the globe, even as we fail to eradicate established diseases such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), malaria and tuberculosis. Virulent strains of known pathogens increasingly appear, as in the recent swine flu outbreak. Current treatments and vaccinations are focused on the pathogen. However, pathogens are able to adapt and rapidly evolve mechanisms to evade anti-bacterial and anti-viral drugs and vaccines. Moreover, once the pathogen has evaded the immune system, the infection may become chronic. Recent efforts in vaccine development therefore include targeting the host by combining pathogen-derived antigens with adjuvants, for example to boost the host immune system (Lederman, 1995) . New avenues for drug discovery may arise from study of the interactions between the pathogens and their hosts. When a pathogen invades a cell, it depends on the host's resources at all stages of its life cycle. To subvert the host cellular machinery for its purposes, the pathogen must communicate with the host, via chains of interactions referred to as signal transduction pathways. These allow cells to respond to the environment, and pathogens to take over the host.",

            "text": "Recently, more than 2500 interactions involving ~1000 human and 17 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) proteins have been catalogued (Fu et al., 2009) . While not all of these interactions may be based on physical contacts, this large number provides a glimpse into the extent of the communication between HIV and its human host, which is particularly remarkable considering the small number of HIV proteins. Small genome size is general for other viral genomes also, which typically encode less than 20 proteins. Increasingly, the interactions involving viruses other than HIV are also being catalogued, e.g., by the Pathogen Interaction Gateway (PIG) (Driscoll et al., 2009) and VirusMINT (Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2009) efforts. These databases store information on PPIs between multiple hosts and pathogens. The VirusMINT database (Chatr-Aryamontri et al., 2009) integrates interactions involving proteins from 149 virus strains and their human binding partners, obtained from sources such as MINT (Zanzoni et al., 2002) , IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2007) and the HIV-1, Human Protein Interaction Database (Fu et al., 2009) . PIG, in addition to interactions with viruses, also includes bacteria (Driscoll et al., 2009 ). These efforts now allow a global view of the PPI networks between pathogens and their hosts. Earlier analysis of proteins targeted by pathogens including bacteria has revealed some common features that appear to be shared amongst several host-pathogen systems (Dyer et al., 2008) . The topological properties of proteins in the human PPI network indicate that pathogens target hub proteins, i.e., proteins that have many interacting partners, or bottlenecks, i.e., proteins that have many 'shortest paths' going through them (Dyer et al., 2008) . A common set of host proteins was identified that are frequently targeted by multiple pathogens, suggesting that at least some of the proteins targeted in humans are conserved across pathogens.",

A comparison of the potential effects of various pathogenic viruses on different signal transduction pathways in the host cell will allow addressing questions such as which viruses target the same pathways, which viruses target pathways that are less or not at all targeted by other viruses and which proteins are common targets for many viruses given the current interaction data. Addressing the above-mentioned questions is expected to advance our fundamental understanding of virus-host communication mechanisms and may help antiviral drug discovery.",

A large number of pathways (>80) contain a single known virus binding partner, but the majority of pathways contain more than one protein interacting with a virus. Most pathways include between 2 and 42 virus binding partners, but two pathways display an exceptionally large number of proteins known to interact with viruses. These are the TGF-\u03b2 and the canonical NF-\u03baB pathways, with 50 and 78 proteins that are known virus binding partners, respectively. These proteins account for 23% and 10% of the proteins present in the corresponding pathway, respectively. Figure  1 (B) shows the number of pathways targeted by one or more viruses. The number of pathways targeted by a single virus is of course equal to the number of pathways targeted by a single protein (>80), as in Figure 1 (A). Most pathways contain proteins interacting with 2-5 different viruses, but some pathways are potentially targeted by up to 18 of the 31 viruses analysed.

            "text": "The above-mentioned analysis indicates that despite the differences in cell surface receptors recognised and required for entry, the different viruses subsequently may target overlapping signal transduction pathways. This is also supported by the relatively similar distribution of the numbers of pathways potentially affected by different viruses, shown in Figure 3 . There are some significant outliers, however. The graph is sorted according to pathway interactions with HIV. The comparison of the pathways affected by HIV with all other viruses highlights that EBV interacts with proteins in pathways, which other viruses, including HIV, may not affect or for which the corresponding interactions have not yet been studied. Major pathways, which are potentially affected by EBV but not other viruses, are listed in the legend of Figure 3 . Further work is required to identify if these outliers reflect a true difference between EBV and other viruses, or if the respective pathways have not yet been investigated for other viruses. Table 3 lists the proteins that interact with at least 2 viruses and shows the number of pathways in which these proteins participate. If a particular protein is present in many pathways, then its interaction with viral proteins may disrupt multiple pathways simultaneously. Interaction of a viral protein with such human proteins may thus up-or down-regulate many pathways allowing the virus to subvert the host's cellular machinery for its purpose at a very broad scale. These proteins include proto-oncogenes such as tyrosine-protein kinases LCK, Fyn and Lyn, proteasome subunit \u03b2 type-6, CREB-binding protein, histone acetyltransferase p300, paxillin and TATA-box-binding protein. Their study can thus be of pharmacological significance. Of the 93 proteins that are targeted by at least 2 proteins, SV interacts with 23 of these and the SV and HPV together have interactions with 17 (from 23) of these proteins. BPV also interacts with a large number (14) of proteins from the set of 93 proteins. BPV and HPV together interact with 13 (from 14) of these proteins. These high overlaps of proteins likely reflect conserved mechanisms of viral communication with their hosts. Figure 4 gives the distribution of the number of pathways and number of proteins targeted by more than one virus. One can see that the number of proteins targeted by different viruses is smaller when compared with the number of pathways. This finding suggests that different viruses target a number of the same pathways by binding to different proteins. This implies that interactions may be conserved at the pathway level, rather than the protein level. It may be more critical for a virus to disrupt a particular pathway by any PPI that may do so, rather than restricting itself to a specific PPI. Pathway disruption may be conserved irrespective of the molecular mechanism of disruption.",

A prime example of this is the TGF-\u03b2 receptor signalling pathway, which is targeted by the maximum number of viruses (18). One possible explanation is because with 212 proteins this pathway is large (see Figure 2 for the general trend). Even more proteins participate in the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway (739), and this pathway is also frequently targeted (by 16 viruses). However, there are other large pathways that are not frequently targeted, for example the electron transport chain has 78 proteins, yet only one has been shown to interact with a viral protein. Thus, it is likely that the frequent targeting of some pathways is functionally significant. To further investigate this observation, we screened the proteins targeted by viruses (among the 413 proteins with Uniprot ID, 411 could be mapped to gene symbols) using the IPA system (see Section 2). The network analysis resulted in 25 enriched networks whose statistical tests were significant (p < 10 \u22125 , score > 5). Table 4 lists 12 most significant networks whose scores were at least 20. We merged networks 1 and 2, both of which had functions related to infectious disease. Figure 5 shows the combined molecular network. As can be seen in the figure, NFKBIA, NFKB1 and NFKB2 are centrally located in the network, providing quantitative support for the finding described earlier, that viruses often target the NF-\u03baB pathway. For many viruses, the largest number of interactions is with the proteins in the canonical NF-\u03baB pathway (see earlier).",

This comparison shows that especially for proteins with degree above 10 the difference becomes very large. Since there is no standard definition of hub in a network, we defined three groups: hubs, intermediate hubs and non-hubs by degree >20, 10 \u2264 degree < 20 and degree < 10, respectively. We then investigated these groups with respect to all virus groups. The results are shown in Table 5 . We found a clear inverse relationship between the percentage of proteins (hubs vs. non-hubs) in the pathways targeted by virus or not. This finding confirms that hub proteins are more likely targeted by viruses.",

It would be interesting to test if these compounds have antiviral activity.

We find an increase in the number of pathways targeted with the size of the pathway targeted, but some pathways are overrepresented in being a virus target. We find that viruses have the potential to target the same pathways, albeit not necessarily via the same PPIs, indicating commonalities in their hijack strategies. One such common strategy is to target hub proteins. It has previously been noted that the EBV targets high degree human proteins (Calderwood et al., 2007) and pathogens in general tend to interact with host proteins with high degrees and betweenness centrality (Dyer et al., 2008) . Finally, we need to note that the validity of any global analysis on the protein interaction data is dependent on the quality of the experimental data. The interaction data, in general, are derived through different experiments and experimental conditions and the resulting sets of protein interactions are more likely to include false positive and negative pairs as well as sample bias. Because of this lack of gold standard data sets, any conclusion that is based on protein interaction data sets should be taken with a grain of salt. However, this type of global views has still the potential to lead us to valuable findings regarding the general phenomena of how organisms work and communicate.",
