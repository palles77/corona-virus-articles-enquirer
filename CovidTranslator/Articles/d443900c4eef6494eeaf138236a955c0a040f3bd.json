Methods: Serum PCT levels were examined in febrile pediatric patients admitted between August 2013 and August 2014. The patients were divided into 3 groups as follows: 49 with KD, 111 with viral infec tions, and 24 with bacterial infections. Results: The mean PCT level in the KD group was significantly lower than that in the bacterial infection group (0.82\u00b11.73 ng/mL vs. 3.11\u00b16.10 ng/mL, P=0.002) and insignificantly different from that in the viral infection group (0.23\u00b10.34 ng/mL,P=0.457). The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Creactive protein (CRP) level in the KD group were significantly higher than those in the viral and bacterial infection groups (P<0.001 and P<0.001 for ESR, P<0.001 and P=0.005 for CRP, respectively). The proportion of patients in the KD group with PCT levels of >1.0 ng/mL was significantly higher in the nonresponders to the initial intravenous immunoglobulin treatment than in the responders (36% vs. 8%, P=0.01). Conclusion: PCT levels may help to differentiate KD from bacterial infections. A combination of disease markers, including ESR, CRP, and PCT, may be useful for differentiating between KD and viral/bacterial infections.",

Increased CRP level in patients with KD plays a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment, and is also a risk factor for coronary arteryrelated complications 12, 19, 20) . However, the clinical impact of serum PCT levels in patients with KD has not been determined. Fever is the first symptom to appear in KD, and the other symp toms do not usually develop simultaneously 7, 8) . The initial high ESR and CRP levels associated with fever are suspected to be indi cative of bacterial infection; hence, oral or intravenous antibiotic therapy may be administered, which usually continues until the symptoms fulfill the criteria of KD. However, patients with KD do not respond to antibiotic therapy and require IVIG treatment in stead. Because KD is a difficult inflammatory disease to diagnose and PCT is a known biomarker of sepsis to diagnose bacterial infection and decide antibiotic treatment, we hypothesized that serum PCT level may differentiate KD from other infections.",

The present study also showed similar results: (1) The mean PCT level in patients with KD and in those with bacterial infection was significantly higher than that in patients with viral infection. (2) The mean PCT level in patients with KD was lower than that in patients with bacterial infection; however, this difference was not significant. We speculated that immune responses to bacterial infections may occur in patients with KD, although the causative microorganism of KD has not yet been confirmed. The definite cause of KD is currently unknown; however, it is generally accepted that KD de velops as a result of a genetic predisposition combined with an infection with an undefined trigger or an autoimmune mecha nism. Many bacterial and viral agents have been suggested but not confirmed as triggers of KD infection. Recently, bacterial toxins or intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies associated with viral infections have been newly hypothesized as causes for the development of KD 18) .",

Although PCT levels were not useful in differentiating between KD and bacterial infections, ESR and CPR levels were significantly higher in patients with KD than in those with bacterial infection. Therefore, not only PCT but also ESR and CRP levels should be considered in febrile pediatric patients.
