Meanwhile, health education campaigns touching on good hygiene practices and social distancing were implemented in hospitals, schools, local communities, and through mass media. 5 Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the government of China has strengthened its surveillance and established the prevention and control system for infectious disease. 6 The level of science and technology in this field in China has since improved significantly. Compared with the abundant research on how the government and institutions could improve the surveillance management and prevention system, there have been few public reports assessing the effect of these policies and the level of health literacy associated with influenza prevention in the general population.",

            "text": "Background: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, behavioral, and skill responses toward influenza in the general population of Beijing after pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Beijing, China, in January 2011. A survey was conducted in which information was collected using a standardized questionnaire. A comprehensive evaluation index system of health literacy related to influenza was built to evaluate the level of health literacy regarding influenza prevention and control among residents in Beijing. Results: Thirteen thousand and fifty-three valid questionnaires were received. The average score for the sum of knowledge, behavior, and skill was 14.12 AE 3.22, and the mean scores for knowledge, behavior, and skill were 4.65 AE 1.20, 7.25 AE 1.94, and 2.21 AE 1.31, respectively. The qualified proportions of these three sections were 23.7%, 11.9%, and 43.4%, respectively, and the total proportion with a qualified level was 6.7%. There were significant differences in health literacy level related to influenza among the different gender, age, educational level, occupational status, and location groups (p < 0.05). There was a significant association between knowledge and behavior (r = 0.084, p < 0.001), and knowledge and skill (r = 0.102, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The health literacy level remains low among the general population in Beijing and the extent of relativities in knowledge, behavior, and skill about influenza was found to be weak. Therefore, improvements are needed in terms of certain aspects, particularly for the elderly and the population of rural districts. Educational level, as a significant factor in reducing the spread of influenza, should be considered seriously when intervention strategies are implemented. \u00df 2014 The Authors.
