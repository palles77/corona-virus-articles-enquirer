Our results show that finance and consumer service industry returns have significant power in explaining the movements of market returns. Further, we apply logit regressions to explore the determinants of the leading hypotheses and find exchange rate and interest rate are important in explaining the industry-market nexus. In a developed market the industry and the market have feedback relations, but in a highly controlled economy the influence from the stock market dominates.",

As a large body of research concentrates on the unidirectional relationship between industry and stock market returns and produces divergent findings, little of the studies discuss about the bi-relationships. For instance, Tessitore and Usmen (2005) compare different industries and find that financials and telecommunications are the dominant industries in explaining stock market returns. Hong, Torous, and Valkanov (2007) verify that industries can lead the stock market, because the returns of industry portfolios that are informative about macroeconomic fundamentals are shown to lead the aggregate market. Tsuji (2012) finds all U.S. industries strongly forecast one-month-ahead small-minus-big factor returns.",

This paper investigates the dynamic linkages between industry and stock market returns from a broader perspective through four hypotheses: (i) industry leading hypothesis: Industry returns exert a unidirectional leading effect on market returns. The hypothesis may be sustained by government support for a specific industry. (ii) market leading hypothesis: Industry returns are determined by market returns, i.e., rising or declining market returns precede the change in industry returns. (iii) feedback hypothesis: There exists a bi-directional causal relation between industry and market returns, meaning that industry and market returns are determined jointly (iv) neutrality hypotheses: No causal relation exists between industry and market returns, meaning that industry returns are not correlated with market returns. We further examine the factors determining the presence of these hypotheses such as GDP growth rate, exports, inflation rate, exchange rate, interest rate, etc.",

The original study by Roll (1992) points out that the capital goods sector is essential for Germany, whereas basic goods sector is important for such producers as South Africa, yet negative for raw material importers like Hong Kong. This implies that industry effects are restrained by country resources and amplified by national advantages. Griffin and Karolyi (1998) reveal that internationally-traded goods industries explain a relatively large proportion of the variation in returns, compared with non-internationally-traded goods industries. Wang, Lee, and Huang (2003) indicate that the influence of the information technology (IT) industry on the stock market apparently dominates that of traditional industries. Tessitore and Usmen (2005) demonstrate that the importance of the IT industry on returns has diminished, and the prominent contributors to industry effects are financials and telecommunications. Thus, the result of the industry returns-stock market returns nexus is still inconclusive.",

The economic successes of several Asian economies and their increasingly important roles in the global financial market have lately motivated several studies (Ito, 2006; Kang & Yoon, 2006; Lee, Chen, & Hsieh, 2013a) . Most of the prior related literature assesses major developed countries, except Wang et al. (2003) . The study of the industry-market nexus focusing on 10 eastern and southern Asia countries has important implications for international investors as the area is now an important emerging market.",

If the relationship is not necessarily stable, but instead evolves over time as several economists argue, then cross-sectional analyses may provide a limited depiction about the relationship. Time-series analyses over the debate on the dynamic associations of the industry and market returns from an alternative perspective are still scarce. To complement recent studies, we focus on time-series analyses concerning the relative importance of the industry-based versus market-based debate.",

We consider the effect of structural breaks in the stock returns, because the stock market is closely correlated with an economic system, and the impact of external factors is inescapable and should attract attention. Neglecting structural break problems makes it hard to find out whether or not parameters are unstable within each of the sub-periods (Lee, 2013; Lee & Chang, 2005) -that is, without considering a structural break, the causal relationship may not be clearly identified due to the effect of unusual economic events.",

For instance, the industry leading hypothesis is supported in the following industries and countries: basic materials in China; consumer services in India, Japan, and Malaysia; financial industry in South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand; health care in Singapore and Taiwan; oil and gas in Thailand; and technology in Malaysia. This suggests that returns of these industries could be used to predict the overall market returns in the respective countries, possibly because of government support for specific industries or due to some industries making up a substantial proportion of the overall stock market values. And, a growth revival can be spotted in the above mentioned industries.",

An obvious difference is identified between the two countries. That is, private enterprises in Japan are major actors in the market and the government exerts little intervention; in Indonesia, however, state-owned enterprises play a prominent role in the economy.

The exchange rate and interest rate are crucial factors that affect the hypotheses simultaneously.

To examine the impact of the long-, intermediate-, and short-term industry returns on market returns, we test the data span covering 10 years, 3 years, and the latest 1 year intervals. We apply the industry classification benchmark (IBC) to segregate markets into ten major industries: basic materials (MATS), consumer goods (GDS), consumer services (SVS), financials (FIN), health care (HEA), industrials (INDU), oil & gas (OIL), technology (TECH), telecommunications (TELE), and utilities (UTIL). The industry indices and market indices in US dollars are from Datastream. We retrieve data for explanatory variables applying logit model analysis (i.e., exports, inflation rate, the percentage change of the domestic price of oil, exchange rate, percentage change in GDP, and the effective interest rate) from World Development Indicators compiled by the World Bank. The control variable (trading activity) 1 and explanatory variable -expected growth of real GDP from Datastream.

South Korea has the highest standard deviation of 0.0214. The Jarque-Bera tests strongly reject normality for all the sample markets, and thus using OLS may obtain misleading results. Among the ten industries, the three with higher returns are MATS, GDS, and OIL in our sample, which are contrary to Yang, Tapon, and Sun (2006) who document that TECH had the highest return during the IT boom period of 1998 to 2002.

We concentrate on the results obtained using the US dollar return series for two reasons. First, a common currency across the ten sampling markets allows us to compare the results easily. Results in terms of US dollar measure are especially relevant to international investors (Chen, Firth, & Rui, 2002) . Second, when returns of indices are expressed in a local currency, part of the index' return volatility is induced by monetary phenomena such as changes in anticipated and actual inflation rates. Historically, inflation emerged as the biggest macroeconomic Table 1 Causality test results between market returns and industry returns (Eqs. (1) and (2) (1) and (2)).",

The results in Panel C shows still hold in eight out of eleven industry-leading industries in controlling for trading activity, suggesting that trading activity does not substantially affect the industry leading relation here.

Chang, McAleer, and Tansuchat (2013) mention that fluctuations in oil prices are likely to have significant effect on the production sector as with every production sector relying heavily on oil as an energy source. Stock returns are negatively related to inflation rate (Geske & Roll, 1983; Kaul, 1987) . Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on trade volume as well as affect the value of firms that are involved in international business. Wang and Mayes (2012) state that interest rate has an effect on stock prices. Keim (1983) provides evidence on the time series behavior of the size effect. We are the first, to our knowledge, to address the impact of industry size on industry returns. Johnson and Mitton (2003) show that firm gains official government support to increases in stock prices.

Government support is a dummy variable that equals 1 if described government support has appeared in the country industry report, and 0 otherwise. Liberalization is cross-listing or country fund listing from Bekaert and Urias (1996) and Patro (2002) . Table 3 shows the results of the logit regression models, in which the exchange rate and interest rate are the two most prominent factors affecting industry-market returns nexus, and the effect is different from the two alternative hypotheses. For the market leading hypothesis, expected growth and change in GDP have significant influences, while export, oil price, and government support are important for the industry leading hypothesis. The exchange rate being relevant with respect to the two alternative hypotheses should correlate with the high dependence on exporting by sampling Asian countries. Government support determining whether industry returns lead market returns may be correlated with government policies for specific industries. An in-depth discussion about these determinants is not pursued here due to space limitation, but may be a topic worthy of further investigation in the future.",

Notes: m = 2 denotes two structural break points, which generate three regimes. The critical value for the 5% significance level is 33.454. SupLR denotes the SupLR test statistic. The null hypothesis is that there is no structural change. Break denotes the estimated date of structural changes. 'n.a.' denotes the test statistic cannot be computed, because the matrix is not positive definite. 'n.d.' denotes data are unavailable.",

Based on the possible dates of structural changes, we divide the whole period into three subperiods. The results show that in different sub-periods the stock returns of some industries in some countries have divergent effects, i.e., positive and negative, on the market returns respectively. On the other hand, Japan's SVS and Malaysia's INDU are negatively impacted by the structural changes, while Japan's FIN and Malaysia's TECH are positively impacted by the structural changes.",

We follow Campbell and Thompson (2008) , Welch and Goyal (2008), and Jacobsen et al. (2011) to compute an out-of-sample R 2 statistic and change in root mean squared predicted errors ( RMSE) to evaluate the performance of the predicted model adopted in this article. 11 When performing an out-of-sample test, selecting an adequate estimation and evaluation periods is important. Welch and Goyal (2008) note that it is not clear how to choose adequate periods when estimating and then evaluating a regression model, but some criteria could be followed even though the choice is ad-hoc in the end. An important requirement is to have enough initial data to reliably estimate the regression model at the start of the evaluation period and the evaluation period needs to be long enough to be representative. As our data frequency is on a daily basis, we use 2010 as the out-of-sample forecast evaluation period and earlier data, i.e., 2001-2009 , to estimate an initial regression. Furthermore, due to space limitation, we choose industries having a unidirectional causal effect on the market return to assess the performance of the predicted regression. 12 Table 7 presents the results of the out-of-sample performance test. We examine if the predicted returns based on the industry leading regression is superior to the pure buy-and-hold returns (BHR). As the forecasted return based on the industry predicted regression (Column 3) shows, the predicted returns have a positive return, except SVS in Japan. Column 5 presents a positive R 2 OS in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan, suggesting that the predicted error of the market returns by the predicted regression is lower than by the historical average in these countries. The result signifies better predictability compared with BHD, even though the predicted strategy could not have 10 As we cannot evaluate this possibility through examining all countries, we view the evidence as suggestive and leave it for the future research. 11 We do not delineate the computation here to save space and refer interested readers to these papers for details. 12 We exclude the technology industry in Malaysia as the data are unavailable after March 23, 2009. Notes: BHR denotes the buy-and-hold return. Forecast denotes the forecasted return based on the predicted industry regression. Difference is the mean difference between buy-and-hold return and forecasted return based on the industry leading regression.

Generally, the market leading hypothesis is supported in most of OIL, GDS, and UTIL; the industry leading hypothesis in SVS and FIN; the feedback hypothesis in HEA and TECH; and the neutrality hypothesis in some of the other industries. Several factors determine the dominance of the alternative hypotheses, including GDP growth rate, exports, oil price, the exchange rate, the interest rate, and government support.
