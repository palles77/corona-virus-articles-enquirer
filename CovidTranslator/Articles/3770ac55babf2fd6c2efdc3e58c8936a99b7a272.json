Strong downstream mRNA secondary (2\u00b0) structures, which must be unfolded for translation, can slow or even halt protein synthesis. Here we employ single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to determine reaction rates for specific steps within the elongation cycle as the Escherichia coli ribosome encounters stem loop or pseudoknot mRNA 2\u00b0 structures. Downstream stem-loops containing 100% G-C base pairs decrease the rates of both tRNA translocation within the ribosome and deacylated tRNA dissociation from the ribosomal exit (E) site. Downstream stem-loops or pseudoknots containing both G-C and A-U pairs also decrease the rate of tRNA dissociation, but they have little effect on tRNA translocation rate. Thus, somewhat surprisingly, unfolding of mRNA 2\u00b0 structures is more closely coupled to E-site tRNA dissociation than to tRNA translocation.",

Translation rates are known to be modulated by mRNA secondary structures downstream of the decoding center. Downstream pseudoknots or stemloops, which have to be unfolded by the ribosome in order to be translated, can slow or even halt protein synthesis. Such pauses have been linked functionally to co-translational protein folding 4 , protein modification, and frame-shifts. Programmed frameshifting 5, 6 , which is often required for viral pathogenicity, is usually associated with 'slippery' oligonucleotide sequences acting in conjunction with pseudoknots 7 .

They contain stem-loop structures with 15, 14, and 13 G-C base pairs, respectively, in which the first G-C pairs of the duplexes are placed at nucleotides +10, +11, and +12, respectively, where +1 is defined as the 5\u2032 base of the Arginine codon, which serves as a reference location in the experiments below ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ). mPK contains a pseudoknot modified from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). We chose this pseudoknot and its variants following studies of Brierly et al. 8, 16, 17 who determined frameshifting efficiency as a function of pseudoknot structure. U7C, which exhibits similar frameshifting efficiency to mPK, stabilizes the pseudoknot. In contrast, variants G3C G4C and G15C G42C, which weaken secondary structure relative to mPK, are not expected to induce frameshifting. mPK-SL, a single 17-bp stem loop with the same set of base pairs as mPK, but no stabilizing tertiary interactions, does not induce frameshifting 8, 17 . The first base-pair of the pseudoknot structures in these mRNAs are located at nucleotide +12, defined as above. mSL-15e, mSL-14e and mSL-13e (Fig. 1) , used in ensemble kinetic experiments described at the end of Results, contain stem-loop structures similar to mSL-15, mSL-14 and mSL-13.",

The PRE and POST complexes studied in these experiments are shown in Fig. 2 .

We initiated translation by injecting into the flow cell a mixture of ternary complexes (aa-tRNA\u00b7EF-Tu\u00b7GTP, TCs) containing Cy3-labeled Arg-tRNA Arg (Cy3-R), Cy5-labeled Phe-tRNA Phe (Cy5-F), and unlabeled Tyr-tRNA Tyr and Glu-tRNA Glu , and other necessary protein synthesis components. Two dwell times were measured from each fluorescence trace (Fig. 3A ): the dwell time of the Cy3-only state, corresponding to the combined lifetimes of complexes 2-3-4, and the dwell time of the FRET state, corresponding to combined lifetimes of complexes 5-6 ( Fig. 2, row B) . Both dwell times are exponentially distributed ( Fig. 3B and C), allowing determination of the overall rate constants for the conversion of PRE ER (2) to PRE RF (5) and of PRE RF (5) to POST F (7) [Figs. 2 (row C) and 3], respectively. These rate constants are presented in Figs. 3D and 3E, and in Supplementary Table 2, for ribosomes programmed with each of the mRNAs studied. It is important to note that since the end of interval (4) is the beginning of interval (5), the reciprocal of the combined dwell times of complexes 2-3-4 gives the overall rate constant for (2) \u2192 (5) conversion. This nomenclature for dwell time distributions and the corresponding fitted rate constants is used for all of the intervals measured in this paper.",

The progressive decrease of translation rate is consistent with the notion that, as expected, the number of base pairs disrupted in this cycle progressively increases from mSL-13 to mSL-14 to mSL-15. In contrast, the rate constants for PRE RF to POST F conversion (5 \u2192 7) are similar for mRNAs mSL-13, mSL-14 and mSL-15 (stemloop duplex starting +12, +11 and +10 relative to +1, the 5\u2032 base of the P-site codon, now Arginine) and 76% less than that of mRNA mPL (Fig. 3E) , suggesting that all of these mRNAs have three stem-loop base pairs disrupted in this elongation cycle. Taken together, these results indicate that the closest intact mRNA base pair is located at 12 or 13 nucleotides (nts) downstream from 5\u2032 base of the P-site codon, in accordance with previous estimates of +12 -+14 11, 14 . A further test of this distance was carried out using ensemble kinetics, which is presented at the end of Results.",

Apparent delivery rates of Cy3-F into the A-site of POST R (4) were measured similarly (Fig. 2 , rows C and D and Supplementary Figure 1 ). The delay time between injecting the labeled tRNA and appearance of Cy3 and FRET intensity was ~7 s, corresponding mostly to second-order binding of Cy3-R to the ribosome, with a 2 nd -order rate constant of ~14 \u03bcM -1 s -1 (= 1/(7 s \u00d7 10 nM Arg-tRNA Arg )).

We measured the dwell times of PRE complexes prior to the transition to the 0.2 FRET state for both complexes PRE ER (2) and PRE RF (5) , and calculated apparent translocation rates of PRE ER to POST ER (2 \u2192 3) and PRE RF to POST RF (5 \u2192 6) (Fig. 4) , respectively. To our surprise, tRNA translocation rates on the 50S subunit in both elongation cycles were hardly affected by mPK or any of its variants (Figs. 4E, 4F, and Supplementary  Table 2 , columns 2 \u2192 3 and 5 \u2192 6) relative to mPL. A more nuanced result was obtained for the mSL variants, which hardly affected the rate of PRE ER to POST ER (2 \u2192 3) conversion, but, in each case, decreased the rate of PRE RF to POST RF (5 \u2192 6) conversion by ~ 50%. These results demonstrate that the unwinding of downstream pseudoknot or stemloop 2\u00b0 structures, which presumably accounts for the slowing of elongation (Fig. 3) , is not rigidly coupled to tRNA translocation in the 50S subunit. In contrast, the results presented below indicate that it is dissociation of tRNA from the E-site that is invariably slowed when the ribosome encounters these 2\u00b0 structures.",

We observed four distinct FRET states that occurred in the temporal sequence E = 0.07, 0.66, 0.40, and 0.78 (Fig. 5A) . A density map for transitions between these states (Supplementary Figure 2) shows that the temporal order among these states was largely unidirectional and highly consistent between traces. To help assign these states to tRNA Arg positions in the ribosome, experiments were conducted at an order of magnitude lower concentration (5 nM) of the next cognate ternary complex, F-TC, than the 50 nM concentration typically employed. The lower concentration slows association of F-TC and POST R (4) to form PRE RF (5), thereby delaying translocation to form POST RF (6) . The dwell times of both 0.40 and 0.66 FRET states were markedly lengthened at 5 nM [F-TC] (dwell time histograms, Fig. 5B , and heat maps, Supplementary Figure 3A and B). Accordingly, these FRET values were assigned to the states containing Cy3-R in the P-site (complexes POST ER (3), POST R (4), and PRE RF (5) Table 2 ). The results show that for both cycles the presence of a downstream stem-loop in mRNA of all G-C base pairs markedly decreases the rate of tRNA dissociation from the E-site. In the earlier cycle, mRNA mSL-13, mSL-14, and mSL-15 progressively decrease rates of tRNA Glu dissociation by 47% to 58% to 66% compared to mRNA mPL (Supplementary Table 2 , column 3 \u2192 4); in the later cycle, tRNA Arg dissociation rate is approximately halved for all three mSL structures (Supplementary Table 2, column 6 \u2192 7) . Although the stem-loops in the mSL variants ( Fig. 1) do not affect the rate of translocation when encountered at positions +13 -+15 relative to 5\u2032 -end of the P-site (+1) (Supplementary Table 2 , column 2 \u2192 3), they do markedly slow translocation at positions +10 -+12 (Supplementary Table 2 , column 5 \u2192 6).",

The generalities that emerge from these results are that downstream 2\u00b0 mRNA structures substantially reduce the dissociation rate of E-site tRNA, that this slowing accounts for the most of the observed rate reduction of the overall elongation cycle for the mRNA structures we have examined, and that the slowing effects are more common when 2\u00b0 structure is encountered at positions +10 -+12 than further downstream (+13 -+15).",

However, mRNA mPK-G15C G42C slows elongation much less than mPK even though the mismatched base pairs in mPK-G15C G42C are located at the 3\u2032 end of the pseudoknot, away from the segment entering the mRNA entry channel. It is possible that destabilization of the stem 2 structure in mPK-G15C G42C results in formation of a simple stem-loop structure with 11 base pairs, which can be more easily unfolded by the ribosome than the native mPK. Alternatively, the extra bulge in mPK-G15C G42C may inhibit untwisting of the 5\u2032 stem during unfolding to a lesser extent than in mPK 28 . Although the three base pairs closest to the mRNA entry channel are all G-C pairs in both mPK-SL and the mSL mRNAs, reducing overall G-C content from 100% (SL series) to 65% (mPK-SL) removed inhibition of translocation from PRE RF (5) to POST RF (6) .

Our previous studies on ribosomes programmed with mRNAs lacking stable downstream 2\u00b0 structure showed the 2-1-2 pathway to be dominant after the first 3 -4 elongation cycles. Consistent with these earlier results, here we found the 2-1-2 pathway to be dominant for tRNA Arg release from the POST RF complex programmed with mPL-mRNA, by two criteria. First, when reactions were carried out using Cy3-R and unlabeled ribosomes, 96 -98% of the Esite Cy3-R molecules disappeared before the binding of the next incoming TC, Cy5-V-TC (Supplementary Figure 4) . Second, the presence or absence of added 50 nM V-TC had no detectable effect on the rate constant for Cy3-R dissociation from the E-site (0.38 \u00b1 0.01 s -1 vs. 0.39 \u00b1 0.01 s -1 ). Similar results were obtained for ribosomes programmed with mPK, mPK-SL, and mSL-15 ( Table 1 ). The contribution of photobleaching in these conditions to disappearance of the fluorescent signal from the ribosome was determined to be less than 2% 19 . These results indicate that, despite the increased tRNA residence time at the E-site that is a consequence of downstream 2\u00b0 mRNA structure, tRNA dissociation from the E-site still precedes cognate TC complex binding to the A-site: i.e., the 2-1-2 pathway is maintained.",

PRE complexes programmed with mRNAs mSL-15e, mSL-14e and mSL-13e (Fig. 1) contained proflavin(prf)-labeled peptidyl-tRNA Arg in the A-site, tRNA Phe in the P-site, and a G-C stem-loop at positions +13, +14, and +15 nts, respectively. Upon rapid mixing of the PRE complexes with EF-G\u00b7GTP, proflavin fluorescence intensity increased and then decreased more slowly, allowing calculation of two apparent rate constants (k app1 and k app2 , Supplementary Figure 5 ). The fast phase, which is beyond the time resolution of our smFRET measurements, is due to a conformational change in the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis by EF-G and precedes tRNA movement. The second slower phase is caused by both translocation and dissociation of tRNA from the E-site. Results at different EF-G concentrations, summarized in Table 2 , show that both phases are progressively slowed as the stem-loop is brought closer to the A-and P-sites, leading to ~80% decreases in both k app1 (37 s -1 to 8 s -1 ) and k app2 (1.4 s -1 to 0.25 s -1 ) for mSL-15e compared with mSL-13e at 4 \u03bcM EF-G, which is close to saturating [EF-G].

The overall rate of elongation in the present experiments is consistent with these earlier studies when the lower tRNA concentrations imposed by fluorescence background here are considered, as described in the notes with Supplementary Table 2 . Their results have been interpreted based on the assumption that helix melting necessarily accompanies the translocation step 14, 15 . Thus, an unexpected feature of our results is that the step in the elongation cycle most consistently affected by downstream secondary structure is E-site tRNA release, rather than translocation of the tRNAs relative to the 50S subunit. This indicates that melting of the RNA duplex at the helicase site takes place mainly after tRNA translocation and before or concomitant with E-site tRNA dissociation. Translocation was measured by changes in the fluorescence of tRNAs labeled within their D-loops 31 that monitor the movement of tRNAs within the large subunit. Movements of mRNA and tRNA in the small subunit were not directly monitored. Since ensemble studies have shown that the overall rates of tRNA and mRNA translocation are equal to one another 32,33 , our results may suggest that the distance from the tRNA binding sites to the mouth of the mRNA entry channel, which for most of the mRNAs we employ is also the edge of the unmelted mRNA 2\u00b0 structure, contracts during translocation and extends again before or during E-site tRNA dissociation. Such a structural change would allow translocation without concomitant unwinding of the mRNA. Alternatively, transient movement of some unmelted secondary structure into the mRNA channel cannot be excluded, given recent cryoelectron microscopy results demonstrating substantial opening of the channel during translocation of ribosome-bound tmRNA 34 due to the movement of protein S3 at the channel entrance.",

Then tRNA release from the E-site would occur either simultaneously with mRNA motion in the small subunit and 2\u00b0 structure unwinding or in a rapid step following unwinding and 30S translocation. Results presented in Supplementary Table 3 indicate that the dynamics of tRNA movements during transitions between the classical and hybrid PRE states 21, 22 are not affected by mRNA 2\u00b0 structure. tRNAs would thus have to bend far more than in the hybrid state to allow further motion in the 50S subunit uncoupled to translocation in the 30S subunit. Such bending is, at least plausible, based on cryoelectron microscopy results demonstrating the presence of tRNAs severely bent in the required direction in eukaryotic ribosomes stalled by the same IBV pseudoknot used in the present work 5 .",

An intermediate possibility is that complete translocation of tRNAs in the large subunit is accompanied by a partial translocation in the small subunit, forming an intermediate in which deacylated tRNA interacts with the E-site in the large subunit and both E-and P-sites in the small subunit, as has recently been suggested from cryo-EM images of translocation intermediates stalled on the ribosome by the antibiotic fusidic acid 34, 35 . Distortion of the tRNAs in both of these studies moves their D-loops several nm farther from L11, as we have observed (Fig. 4) , and such movement could occur prior to mRNA translocation within the 30S subunit. Irrespective of which of these detailed interpretations is correct, our results clearly show that the mRNA entry channel allosterically interacts with the E-site to modulate tRNA dissociation when the ribosome encounters mRNA 2\u00b0 structures. Such communication could be achieved by large scale conformational changes within the ribosome on completion of an elongation cycle, reverse ratcheting 36 and/or reverse swiveling of the 30S head with respect to the 30S body 35 .",

U7C, which exhibits similar frameshifting efficiency to mPK, stabilizes the pseudoknot. In contrast, G3C G4C and G15C G42C, which weaken secondary structure, are expected to show diminished frameshifting efficiency. As anticipated, there is a clear correlation between the propensity of pseudoknot structures and their variants to induce frameshifting, as measured by others 16, 17 , and their tendency to slow E-site tRNA Arg dissociation (Supplementary Table 4 ). The exception is mPK-SL, which shows similar kinetics to those of mPK in our experiments, but does not induce frameshifting in eukaryotes 17 . As suggested by Somogyi et al. 17 , it is possible that some feature of the pseudoknot beyond its ability to pause elongation is important for its induction of frameshifting.",

Using tRNA-tRNA, L11-tRNA and L1-tRNA FRET pairs, we measured rate constants for delivery of ternary complexes into the A-site, translocation of tRNAs in the 50S subunit, and dissociation of E-site tRNAs during elongation cycles when such 2\u00b0 structures were present at the entrance of the mRNA channel. Stem loops containing 100% G-C pairs lead to 45-66% decreases in both the translocation and E-site tRNA dissociation steps suggesting that, when necessary, the ribosome applies two sequential helicase actions within each elongation cycle to unwind duplex mRNA. On the other hand, stable stem loops and pseudoknots containing both G-C and A-U pairs only slow E-site tRNA dissociation, suggesting that in these cases 30S translocation of the tRNAs and unwinding of 2\u00b0 structures are decoupled. Neither stem-loops nor pseudoknots affect the delivery rate of cognate tRNA into the A-site or dynamics of tRNAs between the classical and hybrid PRE states. Our results indicate that, in most cases, the presence of a stable downstream mRNA 2\u00b0 structure at the entrance to the mRNA channel prolongs the lifetime of POST translocation complexes containing tRNAs in both the E-and the P-sites.",

For tRNA-tRNA experiments, alternating excitation between 532 nm and 640 nm excitation 42 was achieved with an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF, AA Opto-Electronic, Inc.) synchronized with the camera. Fluorescence emission from the probes was collected by the microscope and spectrally separated by interference dichroic (630 nm) and bandpass filters, 585/70 nm (Cy3) and 680/50 nm (Cy5), in a Dual-View spectral splitter (Photometrics, Inc., Tucson, AZ).",

Reversible transitions between 0.40 and 0.66 FRET efficiency at low [F-TC] are the result of conformational dynamics of the L1 stalk and of the E-site and P-site tRNAs in complexes POST ER (3) and POST R (4) 25-27 . Pre-formed POST R (4) and PRE RF (5) complexes each gave L1-tRNA FRET values of ~0.40, whereas addition of deacylated tRNA Glu to pre-formed POST R to form the POST ER complex (3) produced the 0.66 FRET state. Taken together, these results allow the 0.07, 0.66, 0.40, and 0.78 FRET states to be assigned to the complexes 2, 3, 4-5, and 6, respectively, in the two different elongation cycles. Although the absolute values of translation rates measured here with different FRET pairs do not exactly match each other (Supplementary Table 2), the trends and extent of slowing of the rates of specific steps affected by secondary structure (columns in Supplementary Table 2) are quite similar for the different FRET pairs. Dissociation rates of tRNA Glu (3 \u2192 4) and tRNA Arg (6 \u2192 7) from the E-site were determined from the dwell times of the 0.66 and 0.78 FRET states, respectively (Fig. 5 and Supplementary",
