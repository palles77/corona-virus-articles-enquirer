            "text": "Background: Lower respiratory tract infections in the first years of life are associated with later asthma, and this observation has led to a focus on the potential causal role of specific respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses and respiratory syncytial virus, in asthma development. However, many respiratory viruses and bacteria trigger similar respiratory symptoms and it is possible that the important risk factors for asthma are the underlying susceptibility to infection and the exaggerated reaction to such triggers rather than the particular triggering agent. Objective: We sought to study the association between specific infections in early life and development of asthma later in childhood. Methods: Three hundred thirteen children were followed prospectively in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies of Asthma in Childhood 2000 high-risk birth cohort. Nine respiratory virus types (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, other picornaviruses, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, influenza viruses AH1, AH3, and B, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, and bocavirus) and 3 pathogenic airway bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) were identified in airway secretions sampled during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms in the first 3 years of life. Asthma was determined by age 7 years. Results: In unadjusted analyses, all viruses and pathogenic bacteria identified during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms were associated with increased risk of asthma by age 7 years with similar odds ratios for all viruses and pathogenic bacteria. After adjustment for the frequency of respiratory episodes, the particular triggers were no longer associated with asthma. Conclusion: The number of respiratory episodes in the first years of life, but not the particular viral trigger, was associated with later asthma development. This suggests that future research should focus on the susceptibility and exaggerated response to lower respiratory tract infections in general rather than on the specific triggering agent.

            "text": "It is a solid clinical observation that asthmatic children experience exacerbations in relation to the common cold, and viruses are more commonly found during asthma exacerbations than in the asymptomatic state. 1 In addition, viral respiratory tract infections in the first years of life have been suspected to initiate a chronic disease trajectory leading to recurrent wheeze and asthma later in childhood, and this putative causal role in asthma development has stimulated a strong focus on the role and pathogenic mechanisms of specific viral agents. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] With respect to long-term consequences on asthma risk, there has previously been a particular focus on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection as a cause of instigating abnormal pulmonary function, wheezing, and asthma in childhood, [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] although recently there has been a focus on the role of human rhinovirus infection in asthma development. 7 However, several viral and bacterial agents can elicit similar asthmatic symptoms in young children 8 and trigger asthma exacerbations in school-aged children. 1 Furthermore, it is clear that individual susceptibility plays an important role in the response to respiratory tract infections. Asthmatic patients have an altered epithelial immune response to rhinoviruses 9 and they are more susceptible to lower respiratory tract infections in relation to these. 10 Also, hyperreactive airways are a hallmark of asthmatic children and we and others have shown that children who later have asthma display increased bronchial responsiveness before any lower respiratory tract illness. 11, 12 Therefore, it is possible that the important risk factors for asthma are the pre-existing susceptibility and inflammatory response to respiratory tract infections in general rather than the specific triggering agent. This is a key question for directing future research: if specific viruses confer a specific risk, then virus-specific mechanisms should be the focus. Alternatively, future research should focus on the underlying susceptibility and hyperreactivity to infections in general. We analyzed the association between specific viruses and pathogenic bacteria detected during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms in early life and asthma status at age 7 years in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2000 (COPSAC 2000 ) birth cohort.",

Troublesome lung symptoms were translated to the parents as any symptom significantly affecting the child's breathing, such as noisy breathing (wheeze or whistling sounds), shortness of breath, or persistent troublesome cough affecting sleep or the activity of the child. Daily symptoms were recorded as composite dichotomized scores (yes/no) each day (ie, the parents were taught to make a global assessment). The complexity of symptoms was detailed in a book that was given to the parents (www. copsac.com/content/literature-parents).

In line with our findings, another birth cohort study reported that respiratory tract infections with RSV and rhinovirus in the first year of life were associated with wheeze and asthma by age 5 years, with no statistically significant difference between the 2 viruses. 24 We have previously shown that pathogenic bacteria are associated with wheezing episodes in young children. 8 Similar to our finding for viruses, it did not seem to determine the long-term course of asthma if the episodes were triggered by bacteria.

There is a significant body of work published on the association between particularly RSV 2-6 and more recently rhinovirus 7 and later development of asthma. On the other hand, predisposition to asthma was associated with increased risk of lower respiratory tract infection and RSV bronchiolitis, the intermediary phenotype associated with asthma. 25 Furthermore, early wheezy symptoms were found to be a strong risk factor for subsequent RSV-related hospitalization. 26 Recently, we demonstrated that children with acute severe virus-induced bronchiolitis were born with increased bronchial responsiveness compared with children without bronchiolitis 27 and that allergic sensitization was a risk factor for rhinovirusinduced wheezing. 28 The present study does not support causal effects of specific viruses: for a given number of respiratory episodes it did not influence the risk of asthma whether any of these, or how many of these, were triggered by a specific virus. A differential risk from different virus types during acute episodes could be interpreted in support of a causal effect from certain viruses. However, our study did not support this observation. Similar to other observational studies, we cannot draw any conclusions on causality of early respiratory tract infections on later asthma from this study. It has been reported that timing of birth in relation to the yearly peak in viral respiratory tract infections was associated with later asthma in support of a causal role of early respiratory infections. 29 A causal role can only be proved in interventional studies showing that removing the virus or preventing infection changes the risk of subsequent asthma. A recent randomized trial of mAbs against RSV demonstrated a protective effect against wheeze in the first year of life and also after the end of treatment, and further follow-up will provide information on the causal role of early RSV infection on asthma. 30 Our results showing a nondifferential response to different viral infections would suggest that a potential causal effect on asthma would not be restricted to RSV infections. It is plausible that early respiratory tract infections interact with genetic susceptibility to asthma and initiate a trajectory toward asthma. An interaction between early respiratory tract infections and the asthma locus at chromosome 17q21 was recently reported from the COPSAC and COAST (Childhood Origins of ASThma) birth cohorts. 31 This locus seemed primarily to be associated with increased susceptibility to respiratory episodes triggered by rhinovirus infection. Future studies must show whether genetics can improve our understanding on the relationship between early infections and asthma.",
