The biogenesis and maturation of the SCV has been studied in detail in both macrophages and epithelial cells. Within a few minutes of bacterial entry, components of the early endocytic pathway, such as EEA1 and the transferrin receptor, are recruited to the SCV (early SCV; Me Steele-Mortimer et al., 1999) . These proteins are then gradually lost, and interactions between the SCV and late endosomal compartments lead to the progressive acquisition of the vacuolar ATPase and several lysosomal membrane proteins (lgps), such as LAMP1 (intermediate SCV; Garcia-del Portillo and Finlay, 1995; Rathman et al., 1997; Me \u00c2resse et al., 1999; Steele-Mortimer et al., 1999) .",

It requires the intracellular synthesis of bacterial proteins and is characterized by the further recruitment of lgps and the initiation of Sif formation. Sifs are tubular structures enriched in lgps and which appear to be contiguous with the SCV (Garcia-del Portillo et al., 1993) . However, the SCV does not accumulate signi\u00aecant amounts of the lysosomal enzymes that are normally delivered to a maturing phagolysosome by the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (Garcia-del Portillo and Finlay, 1995; Rathman et al., 1997) . Interactions between the SCV and the endocytic pathway are therefore selective, and this unique traf\u00aecking pathway creates an environment permissive for bacterial cell division, which begins after a lag period of 3\u00b14 h after invasion (Garcia-del Portillo et al., 1993) .",

This TTSS translocates effector proteins into the vacuolar membrane and cytosol of the host cell. Several effectors have been identi\u00aeed in recent years, encoded both within and outside the pathogenicity island. SpiC is a SPI-2-encoded protein that prevents interactions between SCVs and endocytic compartments in macrophages (Uchiya et al., 1999) . SifA is encoded outside SPI-2, and is required for maintenance of the vacuolar membrane, most likely by facilitating the recruitment and fusion of vesicles with the SCV (Beuzo \u00c2n et al., 2000) . SifA is also required for the formation of Sifs (Stein et al., 1996) . SCV membrane dynamics are also in\u00afuenced by the action of another effector, the predicted acyl transferase SseJ (Ruiz-Albert et al., 2002) . Several other effectors have been described, but the functions of most of them are not understood (Waterman and Holden, 2003) .",

Mutational analysis of this protein identi\u00aeed a Golgi-targeting domain and de\u00aened further regions that are required for recruitment of SCVs to the Golgi network.

Developing microcolonies usually comprised tight clusters of bacteria, positioned close to the nucleus (Figures 1A and 2A ) and were often found closely associated with the Golgi network. Confocal X/Z reconstructions revealed that these microcolonies were partially or completely enveloped by Golgi membranes ( Figure 1A ; Supplementary \u00aegure S1 available at The EMBO Journal Online). This phenomenon was observed using antibodies against a variety of Golgi proteins, including giantin and Golgi matrix protein 130 (GM130) ( Figure 1A and data not shown). Similar results were obtained using an antibody against TGN46, a glycoprotein the subcellular localization of GFP-expressing wild-type S.typhimurium (wt-GFP, green) in relation to the cis-Golgi protein giantin (red), and the host cell (DIC in merged image), 8 h after invasion.

HeLa cells were infected with different mutant strains, then \u00aexed and analysed by confocal microscopy for bacterial association with the Golgi network. SCVs were considered Golgi-associated if they were at least partially surrounded by Golgi membranes. The percentage of wild-type bacteria associated with the Golgi steadily increased to~80% over a 10 h period. However, a strain carrying a mutation in ssaV, which is defective for secretion of all SPI-2 TTSS effector proteins, had a signi\u00aecantly reduced level of association with the Golgi network; <20% of bacteria were associated with the Golgi at any time during the experiment (Figure 2A and B). Although ssaV mutant bacteria remained predominantly perinuclear, in contrast to the wild-type strain they displayed a scattered distribution ( Figure 2A ). No differences were observed between the wild-type and strains carrying mutations in phoP or spvB (data not shown), two virulence loci that are involved in growth of Salmonella in macrophages (Holden, 2002) . To identify the SPI-2 effector responsible for this phenotype, strains carrying mutations in genes encoding different SPI-2-translocated proteins were examined. Whereas sseJ and sseI mutant strains were indistinguishable from the wild-type, an sseG mutant strain had a phenotype similar to that of the ssaV mutant (Figure 2A and C). The Golgitargeting defect of the sseG mutant could be attributed to a lack of SseG because a plasmid containing the wild-type sseG allele restored association with the Golgi to the level of the wild-type strain ( Figure 2C ). Inactivation of SseG leads to a replication defect in macrophages and moderate virulence attenuation in the mouse model of systemic salmonellosis . SseG is predicted to have at least two transmembrane domains; its primary amino acid sequence displays no signi\u00aecant similarities to protein database entries, apart from a 31% similarity to SseF, which is encoded immediately downstream of sseG .",

            "text": "To test the requirement for an intact Golgi network in intracellular growth of Salmonella, cells were treated 15 min after bacterial invasion with Brefeldin A (BFA). BFA inhibits nucleotide exchange on the small GTPase ADP-ribosylating factor (Arf1), which is required for formation of COPI coated vesicles (Chardin and McCormick, 1999) . As a result, the Golgi network rapidly redistributes into the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989) . BFA strongly inhibited intracellular growth of wild-type S.typhimurium, but had little effect on numbers of ssaV mutant bacteria ( Figure 4C ). However, BFA had no noticeable effect on markers of the maturation and traf\u00aecking of the SCV, such as LAMP1 recruitment and cathepsin D exclusion (data not shown). Therefore, the effects of BFA appear to be independent of the selective interactions between SCVs and the late endocytic pathway. As a further test for the requirement of a functional Golgi network in S.typhimurium replication, bacteria were examined in HeLa cells expressing Arf1T31N-GFP, a dominant interfering variant of Arf1 (Dascher and Balch, 1994) . A signi\u00aecant reduction in intracellular bacterial numbers was observed at 12 h after invasion, compared with bacterial replication in cells expressing GFP alone ( Figure 4D ). Sar1 is another small GTPase, involved in COPII-mediated vesicle formation, and its inhibition by constitutively inactive Sar1T39N prevents the formation of early secretory vesicles at ER exit sites (Ward et al., 2001) . Bacterial replication was also severely inhibited in cells expressing this mutant protein ( Figure 4D ). Expression of Arf1T31N-GFP or Sar1T39N had no effect on bacterial internalization (Supplementary table S1 ). Together, these experiments establish that an intact and functional Golgi network is required for intracellular replication of S.typhimurium.",

It follows that SseG contains only two TMDs, which are most likely HR1 and HR2. Therefore, either or both N-and C-terminal regions of the protein might be involved in localizing SCVs to the Golgi network. To test this, variants of SseG were expressed in HeLa cells and assayed for their ability to restore association of the sseG mutant strain with the Golgi network. First, cells were transfected with a construct expressing full-length myc::SseG, then infected with GFP-expressing wild-type or sseG mutant bacteria for 10 h, and examined for bacterial localization. Expression of myc::SseG or mutant versions did not affect the ability of wild-type bacteria to localize ef\u00aeciently to the Golgi network ( Figure 7B ), indicating that these proteins did not exert a dominant-negative effect on Golgi targeting by wild-type bacteria. Ectopically expressed myc::SseG restored Golgi localization of the sseG mutant strain to the level seen with the wild-type strain ( Figure 7B ). Expression of mutants D8 and D10, which were not Golgi associated, did not rescue Golgi localization to the sseG mutant. However, mutants D1, D4 and D6, which were ef\u00aeciently Golgi-localized ( Figure 6B) , also failed to rescue the sseG mutant phenotype ( Figure 7B ). These results demonstrate that in addition to a requirement for the Golgi-targeting region of SseG, information in both the C-and N-terminal regions of the protein is required for the interaction between SCVs and the Golgi network. To determine if other SPI-2 effectors might be involved in Golgi-targeting, myc::SseG was tested for its ability to restore Golgi localization of ssaV (SPI-2 null mutant) bacteria. In contrast to the sseG mutant, Golgi localization of the ssaV mutant could not be rescued by ectopic expression of SseG ( Figure 7B ). This result suggests that other SPI-2 translocated effectors contribute to the process of Salmonella localization to the Golgi network.",

Incorporation of Golgi-derived lipids is thought to provide a mechanism for growth and maintenance of the Chlamydia inclusion membrane (Hackstadt et al., 1997) . Therefore it is possible that SseG could mediate a similar function in acquiring lipids for the SCV membrane. BFA treatment of Chlamydiainfected cells leads to smaller, morphologically abnormal inclusions, but does not affect bacterial multiplication (Hackstadt et al., 1996) . In contrast, BFA had no effect on the integrity or morphology of the SCV membrane, as judged by LAMP1 labelling (data not shown), but strongly inhibited Salmonella replication. Furthermore, Chlamydia inclusions do not interact with endocytic organelles (Wyrick, 2000) , whereas the SPI-2 effector SifA has a major role in the recruitment and probably fusion of lgpcontaining vesicles to the SCV membrane (Ruiz-Albert et al., 2002) . Indeed, mutation of sifA results in a strain that cannot maintain the physical integrity of its vacuolar membrane (Beuzo \u00c2n et al., 2000) . Therefore Salmonella appears to exploit late endocytic organelles as a source of membrane that is required to enclose replicating bacteria, and it seems more likely that interactions between SCVs and the Golgi satisfy a nutritional requirement, for example by providing carbon and/or nitrogen sources which are necessary for bacterial replication.",

First, sseG mutant bacteria fail to localize to the Golgi network of infected cells. Second, this defect can be rescued ef\u00aeciently by ectopic expression of full-length SseG in infected cells, but not by a version lacking the Golgi-targeting domain. In infected cells, SseG was found associated with SCVs and in peripheral punctate structures, which occasionally co-localized with Golgi markers. How then does translocated SseG account for bacterial association with the Golgi? Apart from its Golgi-targeting region, both the proline-rich N-terminal domain and information in the C-terminal 51 amino acids contribute to the localization of SCVs to the Golgi network. Furthermore, localization of sseG mutant but not SPI-2 null mutant bacteria to the Golgi can be rescued by the ectopic expression of SseG in HeLa cells. These results suggest the existence of another SPI-2 effector that functions together with SseG to mediate Golgi localization of SCVs. Alternatively the null mutant may be defective in earlier unrelated processes of vacuole maturation, on which SseG function is dependent. Translocated SseG might interact with its target membrane via the Golgitargeting domain, and to another effector through its N-or C-terminal regions. It is possible that SseG is a component of a multiprotein complex that mediates interactions between SCVs and Golgi membranes.",

Microscopic examination of S.typhimurium in primary and RAW 264.7 macrophages failed to reveal signi\u00aecant association of SCVs with the Golgi network. However, other evidence indicates that S.typhimurium\u00b1Golgi interactions might be relevant in macrophages. First, the virulence of the sseG mutant strain is attenuated in the murine model of infection . Second, the sseG mutant strain has a replication defect in RAW 264.7 macrophages , and in primary peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). Third, treatment of infected macrophages with BFA signi\u00aecantly inhibited S.typhimurium replication (Supplementary \u00aegure S3). Therefore, it seems probable that S.typhimurium does interact with the Golgi network in macrophages, but in a way that does not involve clustering of bacterial microcolonies within Golgi membranes.",

The major conclusion to emerge from the work described here is that while these interactions are necessary for bacterial survival, they are not suf\u00aecient for intracellular replication: this requires SCV interactions with the secretory pathway. The identi\u00aecation of SseG as a Golgi-targeting virulence protein provides the basis for further investigation into the mechanisms by which this pathogen replicates in host cells, could provide insights into the normal functioning of the Golgi network and might ultimately offer novel approaches to inhibit bacterial growth in host cells.",
