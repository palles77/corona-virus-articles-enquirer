            "text": "Background: Community determinants of antibiotics nonadherence, an important contributor of antibiotics resistance, remained unclear. Objectives: Our objective was to investigate whether deficient antibiotics knowledge could contribute to nonadherence in a community with high prevalence of antibiotics resistance. Methods: We recruited 465 people by random sampling from 5 urban areas in Hong Kong. A structured questionnaire was used to assess antibiotics knowledge and adherence. Adherence was defined as completing the most recent course of antibiotics entirely according to physicians' instructions. An antibiotics knowledge score ranging from 0 to 3 (highest) was composed based on the number of correctly answered questions. Results: Of the 465 participants interviewed, 96.3% had heard of the term \"antibiotics,\" and 80.6% recalled having previously received antibiotics prescription. Among the eligible 369 subjects, 32.9% showed nonadherence. Percentages of participants with antibiotics knowledge scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 were 11%, 27%, 33%, and 29%, respectively. There was a higher prevalence of nonadherence among people with lower antibiotics knowledge score (P < .001). Furthermore, people with nonadherence had a significantly lower mean antibiotics knowledge score (1.3 AE 1.0 versus 2.0 AE 0.9, P < .001), with no interaction with education (P < .05). Adjusted for potential confounders, antibiotics knowledge scores of 2, 1, and 0 independently predicted increased risk of nonadherence by 1-fold (odds ratio [OR], 2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.94; P \u00bc .047), 4-fold (OR, 4.77; 95% CI: 2.30-9.92; P < .001), and 17-fold (OR, 18.41; 95% CI: 6.92-48.97; P < .001) respectively, compared with the maximum score of 3. Conclusion: Lack of antibiotics knowledge is a critical determinant of nonadherence independent of education in the community.",

            "text": "In today's postantimicrobial era, 1 antibiotic resistance has emerged into a threatening trend of reversing our decades' progress of therapeutic success. 2 Antibiotics resistance causes substantially increased infectious disease morbidity and mortality, as well as huge burden of cumulative socioeconomic costs. 3, 4 With the alarming emergence of bacteria multiresistant to potent antibiotics, 5,6 the search for new antibiotics has become an issue of urgency. 7 At the same time, there is a pressing need to identify the causes of antibiotics resistance and to devise effective interventions accordingly. 8, 9 The causes of antibiotic resistance are multifactorial, representing a complex interplay among physician practices, patient behavior, and environmental factors. 5 Along with the frequent emergence of resistant microbial strains in the tertiary care setting, such resistant strains are also increasingly found in the community. [10] [11] [12] Larson has emphasized the importance of addressing the community's role in the development of antibiotics resistance including behavioral, environmental, and policy factors. 13 Although previous studies have attempted to understand the dynamics of physicians stewardship 9, 14 and infection control in the hospital setting, 15 research studies that addressed patients' behavioral factors in the community have been scarce. In particular, it remained unclear as to what determines nonadherence behavior among patients who are prescribed antibiotics in the community setting. Unnecessarily long course of antibiotics (overuse) and nonindicated use of antibiotics (eg, for uncomplicated viral infections) are known to be important contributors to the development of bacterial resistance. 13, 16, 17 Although without substantive evidence and requires further proof, nonadherence to prescribed antibiotics may potentially also play an important role. Thus, understanding the determinants of patient adherence could have profound implications for formulating effective public health interventions and policy making. We hypothesize that general knowledge of the appropriate use of antibiotics is important for patients in the community to ensure adherence to antibiotic prescriptions and that lack of this knowledge could negatively impact on adherence.",

Based on multivariable regression model of 4 predictors (age, gender, education, and antibiotics knowledge score) and assuming type I error <.05, a sample size of 312 is required to detect a small effect size of 0.05 with power of 90%. Statistical significance was defined at the level of P value < .05.",

First, in this densely populated area, high rates of antibiotic usage and selection pressure 11 contribute to rapid development of resistant microbial strains. Furthermore, the public sector's dominance 29, 30 in primary health care reduces continuity of physician care in general. Doctor shopping 31 is common, and the patient's bargaining power for selfperceived treatment needs is high. Physicians may feel pressured by the patient's expectation of an antibiotic prescription even in the absence of clinical indications, 32 although that could be an overestimation of the patients' expectations. 33 However, in a competitive, mixed medical ecology, physicians may be driven to respond to patient's wishes and to be overly cautious to avoid potential medico-legal consequences in an atmosphere of protective medicine. 34 The challenge and the need for appropriate physician stewardship has been recognized. 35 On the other hand, several participants reported lack of clear instructions from their physicians as the reason why they did not complete the course of antibiotics. Limited consultation time is often a constraint for physicians in practice, 36 hindering clear explanations for each prescription. Measures to foster communications between physicians and patients and to reconcile their expectations could be useful.",

The differential impact of antibiotics knowledge and background education level on nonadherence suggests that traditional school education have failed to adequately equip the community to demonstrate proper behavior in antibiotics usage. Antibiotic overuse and misuse (and possibly that of nonadherence, which should be confirmed in further studies) are important contributors to the development of bacterial resistance. 13, 16, 17 Targeted and multilevel community education in the appropriate use of antibiotics could be a valuable public health intervention in our combat against the ever-increasing threat of antibiotics resistance.",

However, the related lower threshold of antibiotics prescription in anticipation of potentially severe infections and infection control practices may produce an undesirable counteracting effect. 42 The recent experience from European countries such as Norway 43 has shown that antibiotic resistance can be halted, and potentially reversed, with comprehensive, appropriate legislative measures restricting antibiotics use, which are appropriately implemented and enforced. The need for active surveillance systems of antibiotics use and enforced legislative measures in metropolitans such as Hong Kong needs to be critically reviewed.",

First, we did not include people, albeit a minority, who did not recognize the term \"antibiotics.\" Some of these could have been prescribed antibiotics, but their behavior was not assessed. This should lead to a more conservative estimate of effect size observed. Second, we cannot exclude misclassification error at the initial recruitment based on their prior knowledge of the term \"antibiotics.\" To reduce this potential misclassification, we also included prior experience of physician-prescribed antibiotics as another inclusion criterion. There may be recall error regarding previous antibiotic prescriptions, but any such effect is likely to equally distribute in the sample. Furthermore, if there is a bias because of prompting, it is likely to affect predominantly subjects with poorer knowledge in antibiotics, which would be expected to drive the results towards null, as opposed to the observed results in this study. Third, because the study was conducted in a rather challenging setting (nearby the zebra cross), we had to strike a balance between the depth of inquiry and the need to minimize the interview duration for each subject, so as to ease administration and enhance the response rate. For this reason, we could not inquire further into other important areas including knowledge of treatment failure as an important possible outcome of nonadherence and the (in) appropriateness of using antibiotics for viral infections/ influenza. Finally, this study was conducted in a location with high antibiotic resistance and may not apply to developing countries or suburban areas. Finally, this is a cross-sectional study, and, thus, causality cannot be confirmed. Nevertheless, given the nature of parameters studieddnonadherence and antibiotics knowledgedreverse causality is unlikely. Future large prospective interventional studies would be of great interest.",
