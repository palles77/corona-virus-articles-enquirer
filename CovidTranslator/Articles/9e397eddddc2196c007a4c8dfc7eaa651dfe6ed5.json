Foremost are the viral neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, which have already been used to treat human influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B virus infections. The use of the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine is compounded by the rapid development of drug resistance. Although formally approved for other indications (i.e. treatment of hepatitis C), ribavirin and pegylated interferon might also be useful for controlling avian flu. Combined use of the currently available drugs should be taken into account and attempts should be made to develop new strategies directed at unexplored targets such as the viral proteins hemagglutinin, the viral polymerase (and endonuclease) and the non-structural protein NS1. As has been shown for other viral infections, RNA interference could be a powerful means with which to suppress the replication of avian H5N1.",

After binding to sialic acid receptors, influenza virions are internalized by receptormediated endocytosis. The low pH in the endosomes triggers the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, and the influx of H + through the M2 channel releases the viral RNA genes in the cytoplasm ('uncoating'). Adamantane derivatives block this uncoating step. The RNA replication and transcription steps [which require repeated cycles of (\u00c0)RNA $ (+)RNA polymerization reactions] occur in the nucleus and can be blocked indirectly by inosine 5 0 monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase inhibitors (e.g. ribavirin), which suppress the biosynthesis of GTP, or directly by RNA polymerase inhibitors (e.g. T705). The translation of viral mRNA to proteins could be prevented by interferon and small interfering (si)RNAs. Packaging and budding of virions occur at the cytoplasmic membrane, and neuraminidase inhibitors block the release of newly formed virions from the infected cells [6] .",

First, the amino acid at position 627 in the viral polymerase protein PB2 is mutated from glutamic acid to lysine in H5N1 viruses, and this might represent an adaptation of H5N1 viruses for efficient replication in mammalian cells [42] . Second, the HA of H5N1 viruses contains an unusual stretch of basic amino acids (RRRKKRG) that is cleaved by ubiquitous intracellular proteases (including furin). Recombinant H5N1 viruses that lack these basic amino acids are not virulent in mice [40, 43] . Third, the Cterminal domain of the non-structural protein NS1 of avian H5N1 viruses contains a sequence motif (ESEV/EPEV) that can be considered a virulence factor because it binds to human host proteins and disrupts their morphology and functioning [44] . In ferrets, however, the C-terminal sequence is not required for the virulence of H5N1 viruses [45] . Therefore, the role of the ESEV/EPEV motif and other molecular determinants of the virulence of H5N1 viruses must be explored further [41] .",

This includes compounds that are already used against influenza A virus infections -such as amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir and oseltamivir -in addition to compounds that are used for infections with other viruses, such as ribavirin and pegylated interferon, which are used to treat HCV. Attempts to design and develop further new antiviral drugs should be intensified, whether based on known molecular targets such as neuraminidase and/or the viral uncoating process or on relatively unexplored targets such as the viral endonuclease or the viral RNA polymerase, which, in principle, could be targeted by both nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors. The latter approach can be thought of as analogous to the nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors of the HIV reverse transcriptase and of the HCV RNA polymerase.",
