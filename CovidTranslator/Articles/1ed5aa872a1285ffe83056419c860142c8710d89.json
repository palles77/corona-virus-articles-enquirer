Virus replication, DNA synthesis, and immediate-early gene expression are severely restricted in HmLu-1. We compared adsorption and penetration of BHV-1 in permissive MDBK and semi-permissive HmLu-1 cells. At a low multiplicity of infection, BHV-1 attached to permissive MDBK cells twice as much as to HmLu-1. The presence of heparin inhibited the attachment of BHV-1 to MDBK cells by about 60%, but over 90% of the attachment was inhibited in HmLu-1. To investigate the penetration of BHV-1, we performed the quantitative measurement of viral DNA by quantitative competitive (QC)PCR in infected cells. In MDBK cells, virions attached to the cell surface, penetrated into the cells and were transported to the nucleus. However in HmLu-1, only a small fraction of the virions attached to the cell surface were allowed to penetrate. Our results indicated that the replication of BHV-1 in semi-permissive HmLu-1 was not dramatically restricted at one certain point but at some various stages including adsorption and penetration.",

Many cell lines derived from a wide variety of animals, such as human, monkeys and rodents, are permissive to HSV and PRV, and most of the research on these viruses were carried out using permissive cell systems. However, it is also important to study the growth behavior of herpesviruses in various nonpermissive or semi-permissive cell systems to understand and dissect the fine details of the stages of their viral growth cycles. There have been some examples of such research. Swine testis (ST) cells were abortive to herpes simplex virus (HSV) because the virus was unable to enter the cells through the plasma membrane (Subramanian et al., 1994 (Subramanian et al., , 1995 . For ST cells, virus entry was critically reduced, DNA from the input virus could not be detected, and virus proteins were not synthesized.",

            "text": "Murine resident peritoneal macrophages (ResPMO) produced viral immediate early (IE) protein in the course of HSV-1 infection, but early promoter activities were markedly reduced probably under the influence of infected cell-specific protein0 (ICP0) and therefore were not permissive to HSV (Leary et al., 1985; Tufaro et al., 1987; Sit et al., 1988; Mittel and Field, 1989; Morahan et al., 1989; Wu et al., 1993) . Tufaro et al. (1987) isolated a mutant line of mouse L cells, in which the growth of HSV was abortive. HSV entered the mutant cells normally, negotiated the early stages of infection, yet were impaired at a late stage of virus maturation. It was concluded that the export of newly made glycoproteins was defective in the mutant cells. These studies indicated that the growth of herpesvirus could be arrested at various stages in different systems. Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), which causes economically important diseases in the respiratory tract of cattle, belongs to the a-herpesvirus group (Armstrong et al., 1961; Roizman et al., 1981) but unlike other members of the group, such as HSV-1 or PRV, it has a relatively narrow host range in vitro. BHV-1 can replicate well in bovine-derived cell lines such as Madin Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells but grows poorly in rodent cell lines such as HmLu-1 cells derived from hamster lung. But little knowledge has been obtained about the host specificity. In this study, we investigated at which step BHV-1 replication was restricted in semi-permissive HmLu-1 cells.",

At various times, the cells were washed with PBS, trypsin solution added (0.8% trypsin (w/v), 0.05% EDTA (w/v) in PBS) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. After the trypsin treatment, the cells were washed three times with PBS. DNA was extracted by the method described in Section 2.3. The isolation procedure for nuclei was described previously (Preston, 1979) . Cells in 60 mm dishes were infected with BHV-1/RSV/p32 at moi 5 at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated at 37\u00b0C with a medium containing PAA. At various times, the cells were washed with PBS, scraped into PBS and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 3 min by a minifuge at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellets were suspended in 200 ml lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mMMgCl 2 , 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) and homogenized with a dounce homogenizer until almost all the cells were broken and the nuclei released under microscope examination. Homogenates were centrifuged at 2000\u00d7 g for 2 min, and the pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with sucrose buffer (10 mM Tris-Hcl (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM NaCl, 0.32 M sucrose) at 2000\u00d7g for 4 min. DNA was extracted from the nuclear preparation by the method described above. All work was carried out on ice or at 4\u00b0C except where described otherwise. After ethanol precipitation, each DNA sample was dissolved in 20 ml water and a 1 ml aliquot was subjected to quantitative competitive (QC)PCR reaction. The QCPCR reactions to measure the amount of BHV-1/RSV/ p32 in infected cells or nuclei were designed based on the method described by Gariglio et al. (1997) . The primers used to detect T. sergenti p32 gene were as follows; 5%-AAGCTCGACCTTTCCCAT-3% and 5%-CAGGCGATGAGAAGAGC-3%. Using the p32 gene in plasmid or BHV-1/RSV/p32 as a template, these primers yielded a 517 bp fragment by PCR amplification. A mutant template plasmid pUCp32cdel1, which contained a deletion in the p32 gene, was constructed by cleaving the parental plasmid pUCp32 at the TthIII1 site and deleting some nucleotides with Exonuclease III (Takara) and mung bean nuclease (Takara) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Using pUCp32cdel1 as a template, a 350 bp fragment was amplified by PCR using the same pair of the primers. Known amounts of mutant templates and samples (1 ml) were added to each reaction tube with Taq DNA polymerase Recombinant (GIBCO BRL) and amplified according to the instructions using a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (Perkin-Elmer). The conditions were as follows; incubation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, 35 or 40 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 55\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by a single extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. Amplified DNA fragments (517 and 350 bp) were electrophoretically separated in 1.5% agarose gel. The DNA bands were compared using Luminous Imager ver. 1 for Macintosh (AI-C). The equivalent points, where equal amounts of 517 and 350 bp DNAs were synthesized, were determined according to the standard linear regression curves.",

When infected at a moi 5, the titer of BHV-1 in the MDBK cells started growing exponentially after 3 h, reached a plateau between 12 and 24 h and declined afterwards. In contrast, the titer in HmLu-1 increased very little up to 12 h and increased very slowly afterwards until it reached a plateau at around 48 h. The yield of infectious viruses in the HmLu-1 cells was two orders of magnitude lower than that in the MDBK cells. In the case of infection at a low moi, the difference in the growth in permissive and semi-permissive cells appeared to be greater. In the MDBK cells, BHV-1 replicated exponentially between 16-24 h p.i. reaching up to 10 7 PFU or more at around 48 h p.i. regardless of the initial input of the virus. However, in the HmLu-1 cells, the onset of the virus replication was delayed, starting around 24 h p.i., and the yield of infectious virus was three orders of magnitude lower than in the MDBK cells.

The arrow indicates BHV-1 specific bands (B). attached to both MDBK and HmLu-1 cells, but the amount of BHV-1 attached to HmLu-1 was about half of that attached to MDBK. BHV-1, as well as other herpesviruses, is known to bind to heparan sulfate on the cell surface, and this binding is blocked by heparin (Okazaki et al., 1991) . When labeled BHV-1 was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h in a medium containing 10 U/ml heparin and then added to the MDBK cells, the attachment of BHV-1 to the MDBK cells was reduced by about 60%, suggesting that about 40% of the labeled BHV-1 attached to the MDBK cells not via heparan sulfate but by other mechanisms. On the other hand, 90% of the adsorption of labeled BHV-1 to HmLu-1 was blocked by heparin treatment. This indicates that BHV-1 attached to the HmLu-1 cells mostly through heparan sulfate and only a small fraction of virus attached in a heparan sulfate independent manner. using isotope labeled virions.

In order to measure the viral DNA that fused to the cells, QCPCR was used. In this series of experi-as the wild type BHV-1 in the MDBK or HmLu-1 cells. To quantitate viral DNA in the sample, a series of known amounts of a competitor template plasmid pUCp32cdel1 was mixed with the sample DNA, and the series of mixtures of the sample and the competitor were subjected to PCR amplification using the pair of primers described above. The PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis as shown in Fig. 6A . BHV-1/RSV/p32 contains the wild type p32 gene which yields a 517 bp PCR product, and the competitor plasmid pUCp32cdel1 contains the p32 gene with a deletion which yields a 350 bp PCR product. When an equi-molar amount of BHV-1/RSV/p32 and the competitor plasmid were present in the sample mixture, the same amounts of the 517 bp product and the 350 bp product would be present in the PCR product. The amount of viral DNA in the samples was determined by estimating such a point by analyzing the data in Fig. 6A as described in Section 2. The MDBK or HmLu-1 cells were infected with BHV-1/RSV/p32 at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, washed extensively with cold PBS and incubated with medium at 37\u00b0C for 0, 1, 2, and 5 h. The virions attached onto the surface of cells during incubation at 4\u00b0C and penetrated into the cells when the temperature was shifted to 37\u00b0C (Huang and Wagner, 1964) . To prevent the replication of viral DNA, 400 mg/ml phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) was included in the medium. Total DNA (cellular and viral DNA associated with cells) was extracted before and after trypsin treatment, and the amount of viral DNA was quantitated as above. The trypsin treatment removes attached virions from the cell surface but does not remove fused (penetrated) virions. The results are shown in Fig.  6B . After incubating at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, 1.02 pg equivalent (mean of three independent samples) BHV-1/RSV/p32 DNA was attached to the MDBK cells. However, trypsin treatment removed over 90% of the attached viral DNA, and only 0.095 pg equivalent viral DNA was found to be associated with the cells. The attached virions became more resistant to trypsin treatment when infected MDBK cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C; 0.37, 0.38, and 0.50 pg equivalent viral DNA were detected in the cells after 1, 2, and 5 h incubation periods, respectively. In the MDBK cells, therefore, about 49% of the attached virions became trypsin resistant after 5 h incubation at 37\u00b0C.",

The amount of BHV-1 DNA in the nuclei of MDBK decreased at 12 h p.i. probably because the viral DNA was degraded when the viral DNA replication was inhibited by PAA. In the nuclei of HmLu-1, the amount of viral DNA was below the detection level of the method employed here (B 0.001 pg equivalent).

To study the growth behavior of the virus in a semi-or non-permissive system is very important because it allows for the analysis of the fine details of the particular step where the growth is arrested. In this study we investigated and elucidated the growth behavior of BHV-1 in semi-permissive HmLu-1 cells compared with that in permissive MDBK cells. The HmLu-1 cells have been used to propagate Akabane virus (Kurogi et al., 1976; Liao et al., 1996) , bovine corona virus (Fukai et al., 1998) , bluetongue virus (Ianconescu et al., 1996) and PRV (Shibata et al., 1991; Matsuda Tsuchida et al., 1992) . However, BHV-1 grows poorly in HmLu-1 cells. When the HmLu-1 cells were infected with BHV-1 at low moi, very little CPE was observed, and the virus titer hardly increased after prolonged incubation periods. Infection at high moi caused distinct CPE, and the virus titer increased slightly (less than 1% of that in the MDBK cells). The timing of the virus replication was also delayed in the HmLu-1 cells. The transcripts of the BICP4 and BICP0 genes were synthesized in the MDBK cells immediately after infection by BHV-1, but only a very small quantity of both transcripts was found in the HmLu-1 cells at 12 h p.i. or later. It would appear that the cause of the poor growth in the HmLu-1 cells exist in the step or steps before the induction of the IE gene.",

One adsorption mechanism is through the interaction between viral glycoproteins (gC and gB) and heparan sulfate on the cell surface. This adsorption mechanism is inhibited by heparin (WuDunn and Spear, 1989) . The other adsorption mechanism, which is not inhibited by heparin, is not well understood (Lee and Fuller, 1993) . Radioisotope labeled BHV-1 was adsorbed onto non-permissive HmLu-1 cells although the amount of adsorbed virus was about 50% of that adsorbed onto permissive MDBK cells. When the virus was treated with heparin before infection, the adsorption onto HmLu-1 cells was reduced by 90%. This suggests that 90% of BHV-1 was adsorbed onto semi-permissive HmLu-1 cells through heparan sulfate, and only 10% was adsorbed through the other mechanism. On the other hand, 60% of BHV-1 was adsorbed onto permissive MDBK cells through heparan sulfate and 40% through the heparan sulfate independent mechanism. Therefore, it would appear that the HmLu-1 cells are deficient in their ability to adsorb BHV-1 through the heparan sulfate independent mechanism. Because the heparin wash did not remove the virus which was already attached to either permissive MDBK or semi-permissive HmLu-1 cells, we concluded that after heparan sulfate binding, BHV-1 quickly bound to a cellular factor other than heparan sulfate and became resistant to the heparin wash.",

            "text": "Virus particles fused with the plasma membrane are resistant to trypsin treatment while particles which are just adsorbed on the cell surface are susceptible to trypsin. Quantitative analysis by QCPCR revealed that BHV-1 adsorbed to permissive MDBK cells penetrated into the cells, became trypsin resistant, and gradually were transported to the nuclei. On the other hand, the greater part of virus adsorbed to HmLu-1 remained trypsin sensitive after prolonged incubation and virus DNA was not detectable by the method employed in this study. However, a small number of BHV-1 virions must have reached the nuclei and replicated because a small fraction of BHV-1 infected HmLu-1 became infectious centers as shown in Fig. 1B. Our results suggest that the major bottleneck for the growth of BHV-1 in the HmLu-1 cells may exist at the level of the penetration of the virion. Many viral and cellular factors are involved in the herpesvirus penetration which is probably a multistep event. Montgomery et al. (1996) cloned herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM/HveA) and demonstrated that HVEM mediated the entry of several wild type HSV strains into non-permissive CHO-K1 and ST cells. Mutations in the HSV envelope glycoprotein D (gD) significantly reduced HVEM-mediated entry, suggesting that HVEM functions via HSV gD (Montgomery et al., 1996) . Other evidence existed that gD was important for fusion. Abortive cells could be made resistant to HSV entry while retaining the ability to bind a virus by transfection with plasmid expressing HSV gD (Campadelli-Fiume et al., 1988; Johnson and Spear, 1989) . Soluble forms of HSV gD inhibited virus entry into cells (Johnson et al., 1990) . And recently, two other cell surface proteins named poliovirus receptor-related protein 1 (PRR1)/HveB and PRR2/HveC, were found to mediate HSV entry also by interaction with gD Warner et al., 1998) . For BHV-1, gD expressing cells were reported to resist BHV-1 penetration into the cells (Chase and Letchworth, 1994) . Therefore it might be possible that HmLu-1 cells might lacked the HVEM like factor for BHV-1 gD while MDBK cells express such a factor allowing the penetration and the nuclear transport of BHV-1.",
