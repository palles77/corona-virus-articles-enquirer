Drugs that inhibit the ion channel formed by the 3a protein can be expected to inhibit virus release, and would be a source for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Here we demonstrate that emodin can inhibit the 3a ion channel of coronavirus SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 as well as virus release from HCoV-OC43 with a K 1/2 value of about 20 M. We suggest that viral ion channels, in general, may be a good target for the development of antiviral agents.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in 2002 in China. In mainland China about 50% of patients were treated with Chinese herbal medicine as an adjunct therapy in addition to Western medicine (see ), and some positive effects in SARS patients had been reported (see (Liu et al., 2008) ). By screening a large number of Chinese herbs (Ho et al., 2007) emodin was identified as an effective component of Polygonaceae to block the interaction of the SARS-coronavirus spike protein (SARS-CoV S protein) with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and to reduce the infection by S protein-pseudo-typed retrovirus. The ACE2 was shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV (Kuhn et al., 2004; Li et al., 2003) with a specific binding domain of the S protein (Babcock et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004) . SARS-CoV had been shown to exhibit an open reading frame ORF-3a that codes for an ion-permeable channel in the infected cells; the activity of the 3a protein may influence virus release (Lu et al., 2006) . The ion channel is permeable for monovalent cations with higher permeability for K + than for Na + . Ba 2+ in the external solution effectively can block the channel. The ORF-3a is also named \"New gene\" localized between \"spike and envelope gene\" (SNE) (Zeng et al., 2004) , and has been identified also in other coronaviruses (Lu et al., unpublished , see also (Wang and Sun, 2011) ). This includes the SNE of the human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) which shows similar ion-channel characteristics as the 3a protein of SARS-CoV.",

Females of the clawed toad Xenopus laevis (Maosheng Bio-Technology Com., Shanghai, China) were anaesthetized with 1 g/l H 2 O tricane (MS222, Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland) or in ice water. Parts of the ovary were removed and treated with 0.3 units per ml liberase (Roche) for 3 h to remove enveloping tissue and to obtain isolated oocytes. For expression of HCoV-O43 or SARS-CoV 3a protein the respective cDNA was cloned into pNWP vector (for details see (Lu et al., 2006) ), and cRNA was synthesized using mMESSAGE mMACHINE high-yield capped RNA transcription SP6 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Expression of the protein in oocytes and infected cells had been demonstrated previously ( (Lu et al., 2006) , Lu et al., unpublished) . Oocytes of stage V or VI (Dumont, 1972) were selected and injected with cRNA (20 ng per oocyte); these cells were stored together with uninjected control oocytes for 2 days at 19 \u2022 C in oocyte Ringer's-like solution (ORi, see Section 2.6).

Virus adsorption was carried out for 1 h in medium without serum. Cells were then washed with PBS and cultured with medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and various concentrations of emodin for 40 h at 33 \u2022 C. Hence the emodin was added after the virus absorption was carried out. Since the emodin stock solution was prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), control experiments were conducted in the absence of emodin, but in the presence of the respective concentrations of DMSO indicating that up to 0.5% DMSO had no significant effect on virus release. Only for the highest concentration (1%), which was applied when using 100 M emodin, an inhibition of virus release by 20% could be detected; in the presence of the 100 M emodin virus release was completely inhibited (see Section 3.3).",

            "text": "The work of Lu et al. (2006) has shown that the SNE-3a protein of SARS-CoV forms an ion channel, and its activation may be involved in virus release from the infected cell. Hence, inhibition of the 3a channel can be expected to counteract virus release. Here we have demonstrated that emodin is a potent inhibitor of the 3a channel with a K 1/2 value of about 20 M. The reduction of extracellular viral RNA copies by emodin reflects inhibition of virus release. At high concentrations of emodin also intracellular levels of viral RNA copies were reduced suggesting that the high concentrations may also inhibit other stages of the virus life cycle. The discrepancy between the reported K 1/2 value of 200 M for inhibition of S protein and ACE2 and the 80% inhibition of infectivity at already 50 M (Ho et al., 2007) might be explained by our observation that the block of 3a protein contributes to spread of virus infection in addition to the effect on S protein/ACE2 interaction. Ho et al. (2007) suggested that emondin may act as an antiviral drug by blocking virus infection. In our experiments we applied the emodin only after the virus absorption was carried out; in addition, the HCoV-OC43 appears to bind to cells via N-acetyl-neuramic acid (Vlasak et al., 1988) , which is different from the S protein/ACE2 interaction (Babcock et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004) . Therefore, we suggest that emodin may contribute to reduced virus release from the SARS-CoV-infected cell through inhibition of the current mediated by 3a protein. Indeed, emodin inhibited HCoV-OC43 release from infected RD cells with similar effectiveness of K 1/2 \u2248 20 M for inhibition of SNE-3a protein of SARS-CoV and HCoV-OC43. Reduced virus release from infected cells may provide to the immune system sufficient time to effectively respond to the infection. Emodin or derivatives hence may open the door to novel therapeutics in treatment of SARS and other coronaviruses with SNE gene.",

These channels are sensitive to amantadine, and it was suggested that inhibition of the ion channel activity may affirm the protein as a target for future antiviral therapy. However, amantadine-resistant influenza virus is on the rise though amantadine-resistant mutant residues have been found in locations surrounding the high affinity site in the M2 region (Cady et al., 2010) . Amantadine has failed to have clinically significant antiviral effect in patients where blood concentrations of 1-2 M are the highest that can be achieved (von Wagner et al., 2008) . Wozniak et al. (2010) Wozniak et al.'s (2010) work showed that amantadine is ineffective at the concentrations achieved clinically and thus improved agents targeting the p7 channel activity may have therapeutic potential.",
