Here, we study for the first time the immunogenicity profile of a replicationcompetent smallpox vaccine (vaccinia Tiantan, VTT strain) for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) through mucosal vaccination, which is noninvasive and has a critical implication for massive vaccination programs. Four different routes of vaccination were tested in parallel including intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), oral (i.o.), and subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculations in mice. We found that one time vaccination with an optimal dose of VTT was able to induce anti-VTT Nabs via each of the four routes. Higher levels of antiviral Nabs, however, were induced via the i.n. and i.o. inoculations when compared with the i.m. and s.c. routes. Moreover, the i.n. and i.o. vaccinations also induced higher sustained levels of Nabs overtime, which conferred better protections against homologous or alternating mucosal routes of viral challenges six months post vaccination. The VTT-induced immunity via all four routes, however, was partially effective against the intramuscular viral challenge. Our data have implications for understanding the potential application of mucosal smallpox vaccination and for developing VTT-based vaccines to overcome preexisting antivaccinia immunity.",

Fortunately, this disease was completely eradicated throughout the world by 1980 after the introduction of a global smallpox vaccination campaign [3] . During this process, vaccinia virus, which shares broad antigenic properties with the variola virus, played an essential role as an effective vaccine in inducing protective immunity against smallpox [3] [4] [5] . It is well accepted that vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are critical to protection [6] [7] [8] . The fear of variola virus being deliberately released in potential bioterrorism attacks and the increasing use of vaccinia as vaccine vectors for other diseases such as AIDS have led to more recent studies aimed at understanding the protective immune responses induced by the smallpox vaccine [9, 10] . It is, therefore, necessary to investigate the neutralizing antibody responses induced by historically used smallpox vaccines via different route of vaccination.",

Genetic analysis of VTT genome, however, suggested that it is a vaccinia strain instead of a variola viral variant [14] . The clinical safety of this vaccine has not been clearly documented although VTT was historically used for millions of people. These issues are essential for a safe smallpox vaccine [15] . The biological characteristics of VTT have been described in our recent studies [16, 17] . It was reported that VTT caused larger lesions after intradermal vaccination and was likely more virulent than other widely used smallpox vaccines such as Lister or Wyeth [12, 18] . To date, whether or not VTT can induce protective neutralizing antibody responses through noninvasive mucosal vaccination remains less understood [19, 20] .",

After a three-week interval, all animals were challenged again with the same dose of 2 \u00d7 10 6 PFU MVTT-S. Blood samples were collected on week 3, week 26, week 29, and week 32 for measuring Nab responses after MVTT-S challenge. Our animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Committee on Laboratory Animal Use of Wuhan University. Since MVTT-S is an attenuated VTT variant which is not lethal in mice, we define the full protection by the lack of detectable anti-S Nab response induced by the challenge virus MVTT-S in this study.",

This is a critical question because VTT was historically used as a smallpox vaccine for millions of people yet its potential use as a noninvasive vaccine remains elusive. To address this question, four groups of mice were inoculated with an optimal dose of 10 6 PFU VTT via s.c, i.m., i.n., and i.o. routes, respectively. Another group of mice received a placebo as controls. Three weeks after inoculation, the animals were tested for the production of anti-VTT Nabs using a newly developed FACS-based MVTT-GFP neutralization assay (Figure 1 (a)) [24] . Since the sample quantity is small, pooled sera were tested for each experimental group. The pooled sera contain an equal amount of serum of individualmice in each group. We found that each route of vaccination was able to induce anti-VTT Nab responses after one-time vaccination (Figure 1(b) ).

In contrast, MVTT-S challenges resulted in high levels of anti-S Nabs in VTT-na\u00efve or nonvaccinated mice after the second challenge (Figure 2(a) ). The IC 50 values reached over 1 : 10,000 serum dilution titer. Moreover, i.m. VTT vaccination also protected mice completely against i.n. and i.o. MVTT-S challenges, respectively (Figure 2(a) ). Here, the lack of detectable anti-S Nabs after two consecutive MVTT-S challenges likely suggests a possible complete protection (Figure 2(a) ). Notably, the s.c. VTT vaccination did not completely protect mice against i.n. or i.o. MVTT-S challenges as anti-S antibodies were readily detected three weeks after the second challenge ( Figure 2(b) ). Since the mean anti-S IC 50 titer of all s.c. vaccinated mice was significantly lower than that of all nonvaccinated controls (1 : 1778 versus 1 : 14678, P = .03) (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)), we speculated that at least partial significant protection was achieved by the s.c.

This P = .03 value was determined by comparing the anti-S mean value of the s.c. vaccinated group (1 : 1598, 1 : 1026, and 1 : 2710, with an average value of 1 : 1778) versus control group (1 : 14261, 1 : 8251, and 1 : 21523, with an average value of 1 : 14678). It is possible that the less protection of s.c. vaccinated mice is related to lower levels of anti-VTT neutralizing antibodies induced (Figure 1(a) and Table 1 ). Since MVTT-S causes transient viremia and infection in mice as we recently described [19] , our efforts to detect live challenge virus around three weeks after each challenge in all groups were unsuccessful.",

For this purpose, another three groups of VTT-vaccinated mice were challenged with MVTT-S via the i.m. route also at six months postvaccination. Similarly, no detectable levels of anti-S Nabs were found three weeks after the first MVTT-S challenge, suggesting a protective role of VTT-induced immunity. However, we found that the second MVTT-S challenge was able to generate substantial levels of anti-S Nabs in all three groups ( Figure 3 ). Since the levels of anti-S Nabs (both IC 90 Figure 3 ). Since substantial levels of anti-VTT Nab responses were induced by a one time VTT vaccination via four different routes (Figure 1(b) ), it was puzzling why these Nabs were not able to block i.m. MVTT-S infections completely. For this reason, we speculated that there might be a difference in the recalled anti-VTT Nab responses after the MVTT-S challenges. Therefore, we measured the levels of anti-VTT Nab responses after each of the two MVTT-S challenges. We found that the first MVTT-S challenge boosted the levels of anti-VTT Nabs significantly, confirming its shared neutralizing determinants with VTT (Figure 4(a) ).

We provide evidence that one-time vaccination with VTT through each of four different routes was able to induce long-lasting antivaccinia Nab responses in mice.

VTT vaccination fully protected animals from i.n. and i.o. MVTT-S challenges, i.m., i.n., and i.o. VTT-vaccinated animals were not fully protected from i.m. challenges (Figures 2(a) and 3 ). Our results, therefore, suggested that the route of VTT vaccination is critical for inducing protection in mice. In the meantime, the finding that i.m. MVTT-S challenge overcomes preexisting antivaccinia immunity induced via mucosal routes has implications for MVTTbased mucosal vaccine development.",

It has been demonstrated that Nabs induced by vaccinia vaccine play an essential role in providing sterile immunity against smallpox infections [25, 26] . Here we show that VTT displays an advantage for inducing higher levels of antivaccinia Nabs 7 through the noninvasive mucosal route of vaccination. The underlying mechanism of this finding remains largely unknown, although we have recently provided evidence that the tissue tropism may play a role in affecting the immunogenicity of a vaccinia-based vaccine [19] . Since VTT and its variants unlikely establish long-term persistent infection in mice, mechanisms for the maintenance of immunological memory for lasting Nabs remain to be further investigated [8] . One study showed that antigen can be retained in the draining lymph nodes for extended periods of time [27] . Whether this finding would have implications for the continuous maturation of VTT-induced Nabs observed in our study will require future studies. We acknowledge that different route of vaccination may have different protective effects. We did not conduct a direct comparison between intradermal (i.d.) vaccination with other routes because i.d. vaccination did not seem to induce high levels of Nabs in our previous studies [17] . We, however, will compare the skin scarification vaccination with other routes in our future studies as it conferred sterile protection in humans against smallpox infection historically.",

In this study, we developed a convenient model for animal challenge based on testing of the antibody response to the highly immunogenic S protein. Through our protocol, the preparation of vaccinia virus was mostly intracellular mature virion (IMV) particles. Since the S spike protein was not located on the IMV by Western blot analysis (data not shown), the MVTT-S particles themselves cannot induce S-specific antibodies unless they enter the cells and initiate infection. This design provides anti-S antibody as a valuable biological indicator for protection of MVTT-S challenge in mice and eliminates the biosafety issues related to the restricted use of pathogenic vaccinia WR by laboratory regulations [28] , as well as helps to reduce study costs. Nonpathogenic viral challenge model has previously been used to study the neutralizing antibody-mediated protection against immunodeficiency viral infection [29] . We, however, recognize the limitation of our experimental system because there might be major differences between lethal and nonpathogenic vaccinia challenge systems. For example, NKT-cells, CD8+ CTLs together with Nabs may be involved in protection against a highly pathogenic virus [30] . This issue should be further studied in future studies.",

            "text": "Mucosal VTT vaccination elicited protection against both homologous and heterologous routes of mucosal MVTT-S challenges. Our results have provided scientific evidence that mucosal VTT vaccination (e.g., one time i.n. or i.o. VTT vaccination in this study) likely confers complete protection against mucosal routes of viral challenges (Figure 2(a) ), which is consistent to previous findings [14, 31] . These findings are relevant to smallpox prevention because the vaccination likely provided a protective barrier at the dominant portal of variola viral entry, in the mucosa. This is concluded by the fact that the transmission of smallpox occurs mainly through inhalation of airborne variola virus, usually droplets expressed from the oral, nasal, or pharyngeal mucosa of an infected person [32] . Critically, the role of mucosal immunization with a smallpox vaccine has been demonstrated in previous studies [33, 34] . Since four groups of mice all developed systemic antivaccinia Nabs before MVTT-S challenges (Figure 1(c) ), we speculated that higher levels (4.4-fold) of the Nab responses induced via the mucosal i.n. and i.o. inoculations compared with the s.c. route might have played a role in blocking MVTT-S challenge completely. To this end, the rapidly recalled high levels of anti-VTT Nabs after the MVTT-S challenges might also contribute to this protection (Figure 4(a) ). In spite of these findings, extra attentions should be paid when VTT is used as a human smallpox vaccine for mucosal vaccination due to (1) its in vivo toxicity or virulence [16] as well as (2) its complicated quasispecies containing a group of viral variants [14] . As a substitute, it is evident to use a safely attenuated and homogenous MVTT strain to conduct mucosal smallpox vaccinations [14] .",

(a) A FACS-based neutralization assay was newly developed to measure the anti-VTT neutralizing antibody responses. (b) Serum samples were tested three weeks after the VTT vaccination. (c) Serum samples were tested six months after the VTT vaccination. Due to a limited amount of serum collected from each mouse, pooled sera, which contain an equal amount of serum of each vaccinated mouse in each group, were subjected to each experiment.

An IC 50 value is a serum dilution factor which achieves 50% of viral inhibition as indicated by the dashed horizontal line. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results obtained.

In addition, we determined the anti-VTT Nab response after the second challenge of MVTT-S. We found that the average serum dilution titer of anti-VTT Nabs among i.m., i.n., and i.o. pre-VTT-vaccinated mice had likely saturated at comparable levels with the IC 50 values of 1 : 3410, 1 : 4434, and 1 : 5276, respectively, which is not statistically significant (Figure 4(b)). This P value was calculated from the average values of anti-VTT Nabs after the second challenge from three groups: i.m. (1 : 6280, 1 : 1587, and 1 : 2362, with an average of 1 : 3410), i.n. (1 : 5210, 1 : 2944, and 1 : 5148, with an average of 1 : 4434), and i.o. (1 : 4721, 1 : 6205, and 1 : 4901, with an average of 1 : 5276).Apparently, these levels of the recalled anti-VTT Nabs were sufficient to block completely the mucosal (i.n. and i.o.) but not the systemic (i.m.) MVTT-S challenges, suggesting a likely difference between mucosal and systemic immunity.",
