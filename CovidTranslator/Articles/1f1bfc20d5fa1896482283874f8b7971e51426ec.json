The nucleoprotein (N) of VSV protects the viral genomic RNA and plays an essential role in viral transcription and replication, which makes the nucleoprotein an ideal target of host defense. However, whether and how host innate/intrinsic immunity limits VSV infection by targeting the N protein are unknown. In this study, we found that the N protein of VSV (VSV-N) interacted with a ubiquitin E3 ligase, tripartite motif protein 41 (TRIM41). Overexpression of TRIM41 inhibited VSV infection. Conversely, the depletion of TRIM41 increased host susceptibility to VSV. Furthermore, the E3 ligase defective mutant of TRIM41 failed to limit VSV infection, suggesting the requirement of the E3 ligase activity of TRIM41 in viral restriction. Indeed, TRIM41 ubiquitinated VSV-N in cells and in vitro. TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination leads to the degradation of VSV-N through proteasome, thereby limiting VSV infection. Taken together, our study identifies TRIM41 as a new intrinsic immune factor against VSV by targeting the viral nucleoprotein for ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation.",

            "text": "Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) belongs to the Rhabdoviridae that encapsidates a single-stranded RNA genome encoding five major proteins [1] . VSV is a zoonotic virus with epidemic potential in horse, cattle, and swine, which causes significant economic burden to the livestock industry [2] . To infect host cells, VSV binds to the cell receptors through its glycoprotein (G), which triggers endocytosis followed by uncoating of the helical nucleocapsid (NC) in the cytoplasm. The nucleoprotein (N) encapsidates the viral RNA to form the NC, which is the template for full-length NC replication and for transcription of subgenomic mRNAs [3, 4] . The NC is tightly shielded by N protein and only opens transiently for RNA synthesis by the L polymerase and phosphoprotein (P) [5, 6] . Since the N protein is critical for VSV capsid and viral replication, it is an ideal target for the host immune system. However, whether and how the N protein is targeted by host innate or intrinsic immunity are unknown. Filling this knowledge gap will not only deepen our understanding of host defense to VSV but also pave an avenue for the development of therapeutics for VSV infectious disease.",

The ubiquitin E3 ligase activity is conferred by the conserved N-terminal motif comprising three domains, Really Interesting New Gene (RING), B box, and coiled coil. TRIM proteins have variable C-terminal domains that determine the interaction between the target proteins and TRIM proteins. It is well known that TRIM proteins mediate host innate immune activation and promote the induction of antiviral cytokines and chemokines, such as type I interferon (IFN). For instance, TRIM25 ubiquitinates the cytosolic RNA sensor, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which is critical for subsequent RIG-I oligomerization and activation [7, 8] . TRIM5 interacts with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) capsid and activates NF-\u03baB signaling [9] . Recent studies found that TRIM proteins are also intrinsic immune factors, which limit virus infection by directly targeting viral proteins [10] . For example, TRIM32 ubiquitinates the polymerase basic 1 (PB1) of influenza A virus, which leads to PB1 proteasomal degradation, thereby inhibiting viral infection [11] .",

TRIM41 also mediates monoubiquitination of the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS, thereby promoting type I IFN production [13] . Secondly, TRIM41 is an intrinsic immunity factor that inhibits viral infection. Our recent study discovered that TRIM41 restricts influenza by polyubiquitination and degradation of viral nucleoprotein [14] . Moreover, a recent screening of TRIM proteins found that TRIM41 and other seven TRIM proteins inhibited the hepatitis B virus (HBV) transcription [15] .

To examine whether TRIM41 can conjugate ubiquitin molecules onto VSV-N, we first performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay. As shown in Figure 5A , TRIM41, but not the Del-RING, conjugated the ubiquitin molecules onto VSV-N. Consistently, overexpression of wild type TRIM41, but not the Del-RING mutant, induced the ubiquitination of VSV-N in HEK293 cells ( Figure 5B ). Next, we examined VSV-N ubiquitination in TRIM41 knockout cells. VSV-N was transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin into wild type and TRIM41 knockout HEK293 cells. Knockout of TRIM41 dramatically reduced the levels of polyubiquitin chain conjugated onto VSV-N ( Figure 5C ). These experiments suggest that TRIM41 mediates polyubiquitination of VSV-N. Polyubiquitination often leads to proteasomal degradation of the targeted protein. Thus, we further examined whether TRIM41 mediates VSV-N protein degradation. VSV-N was co-transfected with TRIM41 or the Del-RING into HEK293 cells. Overexpression of full-length TRIM41 reduced the VSV-N expression; however, the Del-RING had a marginal effect on the expression of VSV-N protein ( Figure 5D ). Furthermore, we treated cells with the protease inhibitor MG132 to determine whether TRIM41-mediated protein degradation of VSV-N is proteasome-dependent. HEK293 cells were transfected with VSV-N along with TRIM41 or vector. After 48 h, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 6 h. Western blot analysis found that MG132 treatment blocked TRIM41-mediated VSV-N degradation ( Figure 5E ). In all, the combined data indicate that TRIM41 mediates the ubiquitination of VSV-N, which leads to VSV-N proteasomal degradation, thereby inhibiting VSV infection. ",

            "text": "Innate immunity and intrinsic immunity are the frontlines of host defense to the invading viruses. Innate immunity comprises various signaling cascades leading to the expression of type I IFN and many other antiviral genes. These innate immune signaling pathways are triggered by the products and the by-products of microbes, which are usually foreign to the host. The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and RIG-I are the sensors that recognize the 5'-ppp-RNA of VSV in the endosome and the cytoplasm, respectively [18, 19] . Upon the engagement with viral RNA, TLR7 and RIG-I activate signaling cascades, which lead to the induction of type I IFN expression [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Unlike innate immunity factors, the intrinsic immunity factors are a group of constitutively expressed host factors. The \"pre-existed\" expression of these host factors guarantees a more rapid response and a direct inhibition of viral infection [10, 25] . For example, the cytidine deaminase, apolipoprotein editing complex 3 G (APOBEC3G), introduces transversion mutations into the HIV genome, thereby impeding HIV infection [26] . It is well established for how innate immunity responds to VSV infection; however, the intrinsic immune response to VSV is still elusive. Here, we report that TRIM41 interacts with the N protein of VSV and subsequently targets it for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Our previous study showed that TRIM41 is constitutively expressed [14] . Thus, TRIM41 is a new intrinsic immune factor to VSV. TRIM41 belongs to the TRIM family that consists of more than 70 members. Recently, many TRIM proteins are identified as intrinsic immune factors that curb viral infection through directly targeting viral proteins. For instance, TRIM32 restricts influenza A virus by targeting PB1 protein for ubiquitination and degradation [11] . TRIM22 and TRIM14 restrict hepatitis C virus by targeting NS5A for ubiquitination and degradation [27, 28] . TRIM52 interacts with the nonstructural protein 2A of Japanese encephalitis virus and mediates NS2A ubiquitination and protein degradation [29] . Our study showed that TRIM41 inhibited VSV infection by mediating proteasomal degradation of the N protein. It should be noted that another TRIM protein, PML (also known as TRIM19), has been implied a role in VSV infection. Overexpression of PML in CHO cells increased the resistance to infection of VSV [30] . Furthermore, PML deficiency increases mice susceptibility to VSV infection [31] . A recent mechanistic study showed that PML enhances IFN synthesis by regulating the cellular distribution of Pin1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase). The interaction of PML with endogenous Pin1 prevents the degradation of activated IRF3, thereby potentiating IRF3-dependent production of IFN [32] .",

TRIM41 also inhibits HBV activity, which is dependent on the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and the C-terminal domain of TRIM41 [15] . Thus, TRIM41 has emerged as a broad-spectrum antiviral factor. Like TRIM41, several other TRIM proteins are reported to have a broad-spectrum antiviral activity. PML also inhibits herpes virus and adeno-associated virus [33] . TRIM56 restricts influenza B virus, HIV, yellow fever virus, and dengue virus by reducing the viral RNA levels through its C-terminal tail [34, 35] . TRIM22 restricts encephalomyocarditis virus, influenza A virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus [27, [36] [37] [38] . However, the underlying mechanism for the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of TRIM proteins is unknown. To determine the broad-spectrum antiviral activity, it is important to identify the common mechanism. Future studies will determine whether the interacting viral proteins share a common motif for TRIM41 interaction.",
