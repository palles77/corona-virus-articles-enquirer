            "text": "The cells of the central nervous system (CNS) have the peculiarity of physiologically expressing very low levels of HLA molecules. In multiple sclerosis (MS), however, as in endocrine autoimmune diseases, there is a marked increase of HLA expression in the tissue (i.e. the plaques) and this is attributable not only to infiltrating cells but also to the astrocytes. To gain an insight into the regulation of HLA in the different cell types in the CNS and to compare it to that observed in the endocrine organs, we have studied the effect of the lympho/monokines interferon (IFN)-a and -~,, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and interleukin (IL)-2 and other agents on this aspect of the biology of human fetal brain cells in culture. A two-colour immunofluorescence technique which combines antibodies to diverse CNS cell markers and monoclonai antibodies (MoAbs) to the non-polymorphic region of HLA molecules was used throughout this study. In control cultures, only astrocytes expressed MHC class I, but after incubation with either IFN\u00b0y or TNF-a oligodendrocytes acquired class I expression. Surprisingly, astrocytes became spon-taneously class II positive in culture and this was greatly enhanced by IFN-~,. Other agents such as IL-2, epidermal growth factor, phorbolmyristate acetate and lectins had no effect. The expression of HLA molecules in the cells of the CNS both in basal conditions and in response to lymphokines is therefore selective and highly heterogenous, thus reflecting their intrinsic biological diversity. These findings may help to explain the features of the immunopathology of MS and also of latent viral infections of neural cells.",

Of the latter, the best known are lymphokines and in particular those belonging to the interferon (IFN) family (Review in Pujol-Borrell and . Recently, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-a) and lymphotoxin (LT or TNF-fl) , produced by macrophages and T lymphocytes respectively, have also been found to induce and/or enhance HLA molecule expression in certain systems (Collins et al., 1986; Pfizenmaier et al., 1987; .",

Since the above hypothesis was proposed, the occurrence of inappropriate class II expression has been documented in the target organs of many organ-specific autoimmune diseases (Review in Bottazzo et al., 1986) and the ability of class II-positive thyroid cells to present antigen to T cells has been experimentally demonstrated (Londei et al., 1984 (Londei et al., , 1985 .",

Attempts were not made to identify microglial cells because we lacked specific reagents to recognize them. Endothelial cells were not present in our monolayers, probably due to their inability to grow on glass surfaces (Zetter, 1981) .",

Class I molecules were consistently detected throughout the culture period on astrocytes but not on oligodendrocytes or neurons ( Fig. 2a and b) . Class II molecules were seen in less than 1% of the cells in the culture up to day 3. However, astrocytes (identified by GFAP-positive staining) became gradually class II positive, and by day 20, around 50% of them showed a clear and bright staining ( Fig. 2c and d, time-course in Fig. 3 ). This 'spontaneous' class II expression was observed in both the protoplasmic and the fibrous type of astrocytes (identified by their morphology under phase contrast and confirmed by GFAP + staining) and also in the astrocyte subtype recently defined by the 308 MoAb (Dickson et at., 1983) . Astrocyte class II expression included also HLA-DP and DQ subregion products and did not depend on the gestational age of the fetal brain. Passive absorption of class II molecules to the membrane of the astrocytes could be excluded by the concomitant detection of the non-secretory class II invariant chain in the cytoplasm of these cells when they were stained with MoAb VIC-Y1. The other cell types (neurons and oligodendrocytes) remained negative throughout the culture period (up to 30 days). For the reasons mentioned above, microghal or endothelial cells could not be detected. Table   2 were tested during the initial 8 days of culture when the percentage of spontaneously positive astrocytes was less than 15%, as to minimize the interference of the spontaneous expression of class II in astrocytes in the reading of the preparations (see above). Among the biological and chemical compounds used (Table 2) , only IFN-a, IFN-7 and TNF-a had a clear effect on HLA expression in the different cell types and the results are summarized in Table 3 . Neurons and oligodendrocytes both = Astrocytes did not express class II in the early stages of culture, but an increasing percentage were found spontaneously positive after 6 days in culture (see text and Fig. 4) . lacked class I expression in basal conditions but, while the former remained always negative, oligodendrocytes acquired a clear membrane staining for class I after culture with either IFN-T or TNF-a (Fig. 4) . IFN-a and IFN-T both produced an increase in class I expression in astrocytes and fibroblasts. None of the mediators or chemicals tested were able to induce class II expression in neurons or oligodendrocytes, and this also applies to the combination of IFN-T and TNF-a. IFN-~, was able to produce a dramatic increase in the number of astrocytes positive for membrane and cytoplasmic class II and 4 days after the addition of 1000 U/ml to the cultures, all GFAP-positive cells were stained for class II. This effect was dose related (see Fig. 5 and legend) and was also detectable with the MoAb VIC-Y1 which reacts with the cytoplasmic invariant chain of class II products. No apparent synergism was observed between IFN-~ and TNF-a in the induction of class II in astrocytes (Fig. 6 ).",

Neither IFN-7 nor TNF-a separately or in combination were able to induce class I or class II expression in human fetal neurons. With regard to class I expression our results differ from those reported by Wong et al.

Stages of development, species differences and neoplastic transformation could account for these apparent discrepancies. Referring to class II molecules, our results agree with the generally accepted concept that cells of the neuronal lineage are refractory to the effect of available modulators, alone or in combinations, on the levels of HLA class II expression regardless of the species employed (Wong et ai., 1985) . The inability of IFN-T to induce class I or class II in neurons contrasts with the strong positive modulation it produces on most cell types including terminally differentiated human cells such as thyrocytes and melanocytes (Houghton et al., 1984) . The biological meaning and molecular basis for this differential regulation are at present unknown.",

Our finding that human oligodendrocytes are constitutively negative for both class I and class II molecules but express class I after incubation with IFN-T is in agreement with numerous previous studies on cultures of murine brain cells and suggests the presence of receptors for IFN-T on the surface of these cells (Wong et al., 1984; Suzumura et al., 1985; Tedeschi et al., 1986) . More interesting is the observation that TNF-a can also induce class I expression in oligodendrocytes from human fetal brain. Reports of a similar action of TNF-a on other cell types (Collins et al., 1986) have suggested that this may be one of the mechanisms through which this mediator exerts its anti-tumour action in vivo (Pfizenmaier et ai., 1987) . Neither IFN-T or TNF-a alone or the combination of the two were able, however, to induce class II expression in oligodendrocytes in our system. This is in contrast with our recent findings which showed that human pancreatic islet cells, another cell type unresponsive to IFN-T alone, could be induced to express class II products by the synergistic action of IFN-T and TNF-a or -fl . There is no consensus in the literature on whether adult human oligodendrocytes can express class II molecules following incubation with IFN-T. Lysak et al. (1983) , like us, did not find class II expression in stimulated primary cultures while Kim (1985) and Kim et al. (1985) reported 4-16% of class II-positive oligodendrocytes (although only in half of the culture preparations); the reason for these differences remains at present unclear.",

Astrocytes expressing class II are present in the 'active' plaques in the brain of MS patients (Traugott et al., 1985) and, most importantly, it has been shown that they can present antigens to T cell clones in vitro (Fierz et al., 1985) . The postulate has accordingly been made that by presenting myelin basic protein (MBP) or related antigens to autoreactive T lymphocytes, class II-positive astrocytes may initiate and possibly perpetuate an autoimmune recognition to MBP which subsequently leads to the demyelination process in active MS (Fontana, 1984; Sun and Wekerle, 1986; Takiguchi et al., 1986) . In short-term cultures we found that astrocytes express class I but not class II molecules and this is in accordance with previous work (Fierz et al., 1985) . However, we were surprised by the arousal of a population of astrocytes positive for class II after 5-6 days while these cells were growing in culture. These results may substantiate the report by Kim (1985) which showed that in cultures of human adult brain 9-27% of the astrocytes were class II positive at day 10. Similar findings were described on a human fetal astrocyte cell line, but the spontaneous class II expression disappeared after subsequent passages (Pulver et al., 1987) . This phenomenon seems to be a unique characteristic of the astrocytes since fibroblasts and other cell types present in our cultures remained negative, thus arguing against the possibility that it is mediated by IFNs or other non-specific soluble factors generated during the culture period or by the medium employed, as previously suggested (Pulver et al., 1987) . This spontaneous induction of class II expression indicates that in vivo the expression of class II by astrocytes should be constantly suppressed by still unidentified humoral or locally produced mediators. Alternatively, it is also possible that the abundant debris which our cultures initially contained could have stimulated phagocytosis by the astrocytes and this then triggered the expression of class II, as part of the general activation process undergoing in these cells. In this context, it is of interest to recall that it has recently been shown that the phagocytosis of coronavirus particles induced class II expression in rat astrocytes (Massa et al., 1986) .",

The studies of class II modulation on astrocytes were carried out at the beginning of the culture period while the level of spontaneous expression was still low and in this way we were able to reproduce previous work which has shown that IFN-7 is indeed able to induce a rapid increase in the percentage of class II-positive human fetal astrocytes (Pulver et al., 1987) as well as enhance the intensity of the staining (Fig. 5) . Microglial cells were not easy to identify in our monolayers and this was most probably due to the early gestational age of the fetal tissue.

            "text": "In summary, we have presented for the first time data on a large number of human fetal brains both in sections and in primary cultures indicating that the regulation of the expression of HLA products in human fetal brain cells varies widely among the different cell types. There is a gradation in both constitutive expression and inducibility which ranges from neurons, which lack HLA products completely and are refractory to all inducers and modulators tested so far, to astrocytes which in culture become spontaneously positive for class II and are highly responsive to IFN-y. This heterogeneity of HLA regulation among the brain cells is reminiscent of that observed for class II in the human pancreas where ductal/exocrine cells are easily induced to express class II while islet endocrine cells require a two-med~tor signal . Considering the analogies between the different cell populations which form these two complex organs it seems that the cells with a high or intermediate turnover (ductal cells, astrocytes) are more easily induced to express HLA molecules than those with a low turnover (e.g. islet cells) or no turnover (e.g. neurons). One may speculate on the biological significance of this differential regulation. One possibility is that the lack of inducibility of class II expression may constitute one of the mechanisms which maintain tolerance to autoantigens present in highly specialized cells Cowing, 1985) . On the other hand, absence of class I and inability to express it, may represent a more extreme way of excluding irreplaceable cells from the interaction with the immune system and in particular from the attack by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This may help to explain the inability of the cellular immune mechanisms to eradicate certain neuronal viral infections, such as herpes simplex. It may well be that it is more advantageous for the organism to have some neurons latently infected than not to have them at all, with the consequence of an irreversible disability. If these postulates are correct, it follows that a better knowledge of the differential regulation of HLA protein expression in the central nervous system may contribute to our understanding of the autoimmune processes and latent viral infections occurring in this organ.",
