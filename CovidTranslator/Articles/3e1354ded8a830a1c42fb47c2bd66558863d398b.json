This exposure event was previously described in detail [3] : While a severelycoughing MERS patient stayed at our emergency department (ED) for three days, 675 patients stayed at the ED and had chance to be exposed. After meticulous contact tracing, 175 closely exposed patients were identified and classified into two groups by exposure time and location: group A, patients who stayed in the same examination rooms at the same time with the index case (our ED is composed of zone I~IV for adult patients, and the index case used zone II~IV); and group B, patients who shared the same radiology room or registration area at the same time period (30 min before and 2 h after) with the index case. Exposure sites of group A were subdivided into the zone II, III, and IV, as attack rates of each zone were significantly different (23% (13/57), 32% (7/22), and 8% (3/38), respectively; P \u00bc 0.047) [3] . Included patients were followed for 14 days, which is a previously determined incubation period of MERS-CoV [1] . The Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center approved this study. For simple comparison of clinical variables, Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests were used for continuous variables, and chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the association of clinical variables with MERS-CoV infection. Variables with statistical significance in univariate analyses were included in the multivariate analysis. The effect of exposure intensity was adjusted by including exposure sites in the multivariate analysis. All P-values were two-tailed, and those <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.",

Baseline characteristics and clinical presentation of the study population at the time of ED visit are presented in Table 1 . There was no statistical difference in age, sex, body mass index, and immunosuppressive conditions. Patients exposed at zone II and III showed higher attack rates as previously described [3] . Among underlying diseases, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases were significantly different between infected and non-infected patients (all P < 0.05). Significantly higher proportion of MERS-infected patients presented with tachypnea (respiratory rate > 24/min) at ED visit, compared to noninfected patients (15.4% (4/26) and 2.7% (4/149), respectively; P \u00bc 0.018).

Evaluating an exposure cohort for host susceptibility is often not feasible as enough number, medical records, contact tracing, and follow-up of the exposed patients is required. We experienced a unique situation in that discrete population of patients was exposed to the single index case in the defined space of ED, which made it possible to conduct the first cohort study to evaluate host susceptibility to MERS-CoV. Of note, previously reported poor prognostic factors, including old age, male sex, concomitant infection, low albumin concentrations, lymphopenia, diabetes, and multiple comorbidities [3, 5, 6] , were not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. These factors were evaluated in the present cohort with sufficient numbers, and the analysis indicated that they did not play critical roles in host susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. This finding suggests that risk factors associated with poor prognosis and host susceptibility need to be separately considered. Meticulous surveillance of MERS-CoV exposed patients should be conducted regardless of presence of poor prognosis factors.",

Although susceptibility of autologous SCT recipients to viral infections after engraftment has not been well evaluated, two of three autologous SCT recipients (66.7%) in the present cohort were infected with MERS-CoV despite relatively low exposure intensity (at radiology room and zone IV). Because all the autologous SCT recipients in this cohort had underlying lymphoma and had multiple chemotherapy before SCT, whether autologous SCT per se or heavily-treated aggressive lymphoma would be a risk for increased host susceptibility for MERS-CoV infection is not conclusive. Also, immunocompromising conditions generally associated with viral infections including hematologic malignancies other than lymphoma, allogeneic SCT, and corticosteroid use were scarcely included in this cohort [7, 8] . Therefore, it would be more relevant to interpret the present data that severely immunocompromised hosts could be more vulnerable to MERS-CoV infection and need special caution when exposed to the virus.",
