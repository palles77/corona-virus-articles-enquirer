The familial form of disseminated atypical mycobacterial infection and disseminated BCG infection are both caused by defects in one of the following genes involved in interferon-gamma effector pathway: interferon-gamma receptor-1 (IFNGR1), interferon-gamma receptor-2 (IFNGR2), interleukin-12B (IL12B), interleukin-12 receptor \u03b2 (IL12RB1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1). However, these familial forms Clinica Chimica Acta 406 (2009) 98-102 of predisposition are rare.

As the extent of host response to lung infection was partly determined by the expression level of CXCL-10 and its blood concentration [18] , we hypothesized that genetic variation in the gene encoding for CXCL-10 might be a cause of the between-individual difference of CXCL-10 expression. It is also expected that genetic variations affecting the transactivation of chemokine genes, particularly those in the promoter region of the gene, might influence the extent of gene expression after stimulation, and thus determine the susceptibility to infection. There are many examples of disease predisposition polymorphisms in promoter regions of various genes [20, 21] . Here, we used a genetic association approach to study whether the promoter variations of CXCL-10 were associated with predisposition for TB.",

This association was also confirmed by permutation analysis and suggested that haplotype GAG (at the position \u22121447/\u2212872/\u2212 135) accounted for most of the protective effect. Interestingly, Deng et al. [ref needed] found that \u2212 135G NA was also highly associated with susceptibility to liver disease progression (cirrhosis or liver cancer) among HBV carriers. The \u2212 135G NA polymorphism regulated the expression of CXCL-10 [19] , which suggested that this SNP was important in transactivation of CXCL-10. The A allele had both strong nuclear protein binding affinity on EMSA and an increased transactivation capacity on luciferase reporter assay.",
