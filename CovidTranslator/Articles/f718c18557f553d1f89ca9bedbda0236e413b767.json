REGN3051 and REGN3048 are two fully human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against MERS-CoV that reduced virus replication in mice expressing human DPP4 upon prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. Here, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of REGN3048 and REGN3051 in the common marmoset model of MERS-CoV infection. Intravenous administration of mAb resulted in high levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing activity in circulating blood. When animals were treated with mAbs one day before challenge, respiratory disease was less severe and, in animals treated with both REGN3048 and REGN3051, viral loads in the lungs were reduced. However, therapeutic treatment on day one after challenge was less efficacious as it did not prevent the development of severe respiratory disease and all treated animals developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia of similar severity as the control animals. Thus, mAb administration may be more effective in a prophylactic treatment regimen rather than treatment of MERS.",

The high case-fatality rate of MERS-CoV infections underlines the urgent need for an effective treatment to reduce the burden of disease. Convalescent plasma therapy has been suggested as a promising option for improving disease outcome in MERS patients (Consortium, 2013) . A meta-analysis of studies into the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in SARS patients showed a reduced casefatality rate and reduced time to discharge in patients when treatment was administered early in the disease course; however, the quality of studies included in the meta-analysis was considered low and with a moderate to high risk of bias (Mair-Jenkins et al., 2015) .",

            "text": "As a proof of concept for the therapeutic or prophylactic approach of convalescent plasma for MERS CoV, MERS-CoV-neutralizing serum from Egyptian dromedary camels naturally infected with MERS-CoV was transferred to IFNAR -/mice transduced with an adenovirus expressing human DPP4 (Ad5-hDPP4) and inoculated with MERS-CoV, resulting in reduced weight loss and lung pathology in treated animals compared to controls . Polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations from the plasma of transchromosomal cows or horses vaccinated against MERS-CoV were also effective in reducing lung virus titers when administered to Ad5-hDPP4 mice one day after inoculation with MERS-CoV Zhao et al., 2017) . However, despite promising results in mouse models, the high case-fatality rate in humans, low neutralizing antibody titers in survivors and the inability of many survivors to function as plasma donors due to underlying health issues are considerable hurdles in the implementation of convalescent plasma therapy for MERS patients (Arabi et al., 2016) . Monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment could provide an alternative for convalescent plasma, and several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been developed and tested in animal models (Agrawal et al., 2016;  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.06.006 Received 2 April 2018; Received in revised form 4 June 2018; Accepted 5 June 2018 Corti et al., 2015; Houser et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015; Pascal et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2016) . REGN3051 and REGN3048 are two fully human, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that bind to previously described distinct epitopes in the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV spike protein (Pascal et al., 2015) . Treatment of mice expressing human DPP4 under control of the mouse DPP4-regulatory elements with 200 \u03bcg of either REGN3048 or REGN3051 24hrs before inoculation with MERS-CoV significantly reduced virus titers in the lungs; similarly, treatment of mice with 500 \u03bcg REGN3051 24hrs after inoculation with MERS-CoV also reduced virus titers in the lungs. Inoculation of common marmosets with MERS-CoV results in coalescing bronchointerstitial pneumonia with clear signs of respiratory disease that may require euthanasia (Chan et al., 2015; Falzarano et al., 2014) . Here, we evaluated the ability of the human, neutralizing mAbs REGN3048 and REGN3051 to reduce disease severity and virus replication in the lungs of common marmosets inoculated with MERS-CoV upon prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. In this model, there was a clear clinical benefit upon prophylactic treatment with mAb; however, the effect of therapeutic mAb treatment on the disease course was limited.",

The marmosets in group II were treated prophylactically on day \u22121 with 25 mg/kg REGN3051; Group III was treated prophylactically on day \u22121 with a combination of REGN3048 and REGN3051 at 12.5 mg/kg each; group IV was treated therapeutically on day 1 with 10 mg/kg REGN3051 and group V was treated therapeutically on day 1 with 25 mg/kg.

As expected, no neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV were detected in the animals in group I that were infused with a control mAb (Fig. 1) . The animals in groups II and III that were treated prophylactically had very high neutralizing antibody titers at the time of inoculation with MERS-CoV on day 0, ranging from 2560 to 7680 in individual animals. In five out of six animals in group II, the neutralizing titers had dropped between 0 and 6 dpi (Fig. 1) .

One animal in this group was euthanized due to severity of disease on 5 dpi; neutralizing titers in this animal were 2560 on 2 dpi and remained high at time of euthanasia (1280), so the severe disease observed in this animal was unlikely to be due to low neutralizing antibody titers. The animals in group V received a higher mAb dose than those in group IV, and this was reflected in the level of neutralizing antibodies detected in serum, that ranged from 1280 to 10,240 on 2 dpi.

Since the lungs are the main site of MERS-CoV replication in common marmosets, we compared the viral loads, as determined by qRT-PCR (Corman et al., 2012) , in all four lung lobes. In group I, viral loads in all lung lobes were consistently high; variation between animals was much larger in the groups treated with MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 3A) . Further analysis of complete lung viral loads (Fig. 3B) showed that viral loads of animals in treatment groups III and IV were statistically significantly lower (Oneway ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test) than those in animals in group I; viral loads in the lungs of animals in treatment groups II and V did not differ significantly from those in group I. Of note, the animal in group IV that was euthanized on 5 dpi was excluded from this analysis; however, even when this animal is included there is still a statistically significant difference between lung viral loads in group I vs. group IV, but the difference is smaller. These differences do not correlate with the dose of mAb administered to the animals. Various other tissues were also tested for the presence of viral RNA. The viral loads in respiratory tissues and lymph nodes that drain those tissues were often significantly higher in the animals in group I than in the treated groups II-V. In extra-respiratory tissues there were few significant differences between the viral loads in animals in control group I versus any of the treatment groups (Fig. 4) . Of note, the animal in group IV that was euthanized on 5 dpi due to severity of disease, was excluded from these analyses. Viral loads in tissues from this animal are displayed separately in Fig. S1 .",

Should the impact on patient treatment be limited by the timing of health seeking behavior by patients, MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs may still be useful for patient management during MERS-CoV outbreaks. Many MERS-CoV outbreaks have centered around health care settings, and the presence of comorbidities in MERS patients is linked to a poor prognosis. Thus, one could consider prophylactic treatment of specific target populations and their family members once several MERS cases have been identified in a health care facility, similar to the current practice of mAb prophylaxis of children at increased risk of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus (American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious and American Academy of Pediatrics Bronchiolitis Guidelines, 2014). Moreover, it is possible that neutralizing mAbs will provide therapeutic benefit when combined with other antiviral treatment regimens that are currently under investigation for MERS.",

Histopathological changes in the lungs of common marmosets inoculated with MERS-CoV and treated with neutralizing mAbs. Five groups of six marmosets were inoculated with MERS-CoV and treated with mAb as indicated in Table 1 . On 6 dpi all animals were euthanized and lung samples were collected and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (A, B, D, E, G, H, J, K, M, N) or a polyclonal \u03b1-MERS-CoV antibody (C, F, I, L, O). One representative image was chosen for group I (A, B, C), group II (D, E, F), group III (G, H, I), group IV (J, K, L) and group V (M, N, O). Treatment groups: Group I: 25 mg/kg REGN684; Group II: 25 mg/kg REGN3051 prophylactically; Group III: 12.5 mg/kg REGN3048 and 12.5 mg/kg REGN3051 prophylactically; Group IV: 10 mg/kg REGN3051 therapeutically; Group V: 25 mg/kg REGN3051 therapeutically. Panels were chosen to reflect the overall histopathology in the lung most accurately and were therefore not all collected from the same lung lobe; however, the 20x HE and IHC panels are from consecutive tissue sections. Magnification is indicated at the top of the figure. Table 1 . On 6 dpi all animals were euthanized and lung samples were collected and stained with a polyclonal \u03b1-MERS-CoV antibody; slides of all four lung lobes of all animals were digitized and antigen-positive pixels were quantified using the ImageScope positive pixel algorithm. The percentage antigen-positive pixels was calculated as the number of pixels stained for MERS-CoV antigen divided by the total number of stained pixels (i.e. non-stained areas such as air spaces were excluded from the analysis). Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test was performed to determine statistical significant differences between Group I and the other 4 groups. * indicates P < 0.05. Treatment groups: Group I: 25 mg/kg REGN684; Group II: 25 mg/kg REGN3051 prophylactically; Group III: 12.5 mg/kg REGN3048 and 12.5 mg/kg REGN3051 prophylactically; Group IV: 10 mg/kg REGN3051 therapeutically; Group V: 25 mg/kg REGN3051 therapeutically.",
