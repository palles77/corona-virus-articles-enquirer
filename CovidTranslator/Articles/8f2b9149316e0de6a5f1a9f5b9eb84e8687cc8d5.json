The mutated G-cDNA was made to encode a virulent type G protein [G(Arg)] having arginine, instead of glutamine, at position 333.

We found that, when G(Arg) protein was expressed in G(Arg)-NA cell cultures upon induction with sodium butyrate treatment, extensive syncytium formation was observed under the neutral pH conditions, but no such syncytium was observed in G(Arg)-BHK, G(Gln)-BHK, or G(Gln)-NA cell cultures.

After being cut with BarnHI, the negative strand of the G-cDNA was transferred into the BarnHI site of the Ml 3mpl g-am4 vector having an amber mutation in gene 4 of M 13 (at 5237). The vector can grow only in the supE strain of Escherichia co/i. A 20-mer (5'-AAGTCTGTCCGGACCTGGAA-3') was used as the mutagenic oligonucleotide primer to induce a mutation in the G gene (at position 333 of G protein), which would result in a single amino acid change, from glutamine to arginine, at position 333 of G protein, as well as introduce a new cutting site for a restriction enzyme Acclll. Another mutagenic oligonucleotide primer, SEL 1 (5'~AAGAGTCTGTCCATCAC-3', the selection primer), was also annealed to the vector to restore the glutamine codon at the amber mutated site in gene 4 of M 13 phage. Accordingly, the mutated revertant phage vectors were made to grow in the nonsupressor strain. The revertant vectors obtained were first examined for the acquisition of the new Acclll site. The amino acid substitution in the mutant G protein was further checked by a DNA sequencing technique. The authentic HEP G-cDNA is referred to as G(Gln)-cDNA or nonpathogenic type G-cDNA, and the mutated G-cDNA is referred to as G(Arg)-cDNA or pathogenic type G-cDNA in this article.

As shown in Fig. 8A , we could observe massive syncytium formations in the cocultures of G(Arg)-BHK cells with NA cells only when they were treated with sodium butyrate (Fig. 8A ), but not under the untreated conditions (data not shown). As already noted above, no syncytium was observed in both the control single cultures of G(Arg)-BHK cells (Fig. 8C ) and the sodium butyrate-treated NA cells (Fig. 8D ). When G(Arg)-BHK cells were cocultivated with the pretreated NA cells, syncytium formation was not so efficient probably due to rapid retraction of the sodium butyrate-induced host cell factor(s) of the cell during the cocultivation in the absence of the agent (the pretreated NA cells recovered its round shape soon after the elimination of sodium butyrate from the culture medium and began to propagate). In addition, no syncytium was observed in the cocultures of G(Gln)-BHK and sodium butyrate-treated NA cells (Fig. 8B) . These results demonstrate that G(Arg) proteins synthesized by BHK-21 cells are as active in the syncytium formation as those synthesized by G(Arg)-NA cells, and that a cellular factor(s) expressed on the sodium butyrate-treated NA cells is required for syncytium formation. Although it was suggested that the G(Arg) proteins were differently glycosylated in NA and BHK-21 cells (Fig. 2 ) the difference does not seem to cause any difference in the syncytium-forming potency of G protein. These results not only indicate that G(Arg) protein has an ability to produce syncytia of NA cells regardless of cell types by which the G protein was produced but also suggest strongly that some cellular factor(s) is also required for syncytium formation, the cellular factor(s) which is lacking in BHK-21 and untreated NA cells but is induced in NA cells by sodium butyrate treatment.",

For this purpose, we used two types of G-cDNAs, the original G-cDNA of the nonpathogenic type virus (HEP strain) (Morimoto et a/., 1989 ) and its point mutant, which was made to encode a pathogenic type G(Arg) protein having arginine, instead of glutamine, at position 333. With these G-cDNAs, four types of G gene-containing cell lines were obtained from BHK-2 1 and neuroblastoma NA cells. By using these cell lines, we found that only the pathogenic-type G(Arg) protein had an ability to induce the giant cell formation at a neutral pH, whereas the nonpathogenic-type G(Gln) protein did not display such an activity, although the amounts of G(Gln) proteins expressed on the cell surface were similar to those of G(Arg)-NA cells. During the incubation periods of these cultures, the pH of the culture fluids did not decrease below 7.0 even in the presence of 5 mM sodium butyrate. These observations show that arginine-333 is necessary for G protein to display the fusion activity at a neutral pH. The syncytium-forming ability of G(Arg) protein was independent of the cell types by which G(Arg) protein was produced. Syncytium formation was correlated with expression of G protein on the cell surface of G(Arg)-NA cells and was completely inhibited by anti-G antiserum, indicating that G(Arg) proteins which are expressed on the cell surface are involved in the syncytium formation.",

These observations also suggest that the host cell factor(s) is lacking or present in very small amounts in BHK-21 and untreated NA cells, but could be induced in NA cells by treatment with sodium butyrate.

On Day 4 after the sodium butyrate treatment, they were fixed and stained with a Sellers' staining solution.

            "text": "Consistent with the results obtained from cDNA transfection experiments, we could also see the pH-independent cell fusion (syncytium formation at the neutral pH) in the virus infection system (unpublished observations). Only the pathogenic-type rabies virus (such as ERA strain and the neurovirulent revertants of HEP strain) induced the cell fusion in the sodium butyrate-treated NA cell cultures, but the nonpathogenic HEP strain did not. As expected, such pathogenic virus-induced pH-independent cell fusion could not be As reported by Mifune et al. (1982) , rabies virus causes cell fusion at acidic pH, but no difference has been described between the pathogenic and nonpathogenic mutant viruses in their ability of low pH-dependent cell fusion (Wunner and Dietzschold, 1987) . We also observed that the nonpathogenic virus (HEP strain) and the pathogenic virus (ERA strain and a pathogenic revertant of HEP strain) equally induced cell fusion in both BHK-21 and NA cell cultures when they were exposed to pH 5.0 (unpublished observations). Very recently, Whitt et al. (1991) reported that the rabies virus G protein (CVS strain) expressed on the cDNA-transfected HeLa cells induced giant cell formation under low pH conditions. Unexpectedly, however, we could not observe syncytium formation in the cultures of G(Arg)-BHK, G(Gln)-BHK and G(Gln)-NA cells even when they were exposed to acidic pH (5.1-5.7). We suppose that, although the amount of G(Arg) protein expressed on the surface of G(Arg)-NA cells was enough for the pH-independent cell fusion, such amount of G proteins expressed on the surface of G(Arg)-BHK, G(Gln)-NA and G(Gln)-BHK cells would not be enough for the low pH-dependent syncytium formation, and more abundant G protein should be expressed. Alternatively, other viral factor(s), such as another viral envelope component (the matrix protein) might be required in the case of HEP virus G protein. As for the former possibility, the estimated amounts of G protein produced by G(Gln)-BHK and the butyratetreated G(Gln)-NA cells were at most 2 to 3% of those produced by the virus-infected BHK-21 and NA cells, respectively (Morimoto et al., 1992) . Table 1 compares the properties of two types of rabies virus-induced cell fusion (syncytium formation): in addition to the dependence of different pH, two other properties could be distinguished. First, syncytium formation at the neutral pH (low pH-independent cell fusion) was caused only by the pathogenic type rabies virus and G(Arg) protein, whereas the low pH-dependent cell fusion is caused by both the pathogenic and nonpathogenic type viruses and G proteins. Second, the G(Arg)-induced cell fusion at the neutral pH requires some cellular factor(s) which is specifically expressed on the cells of neuronal origin, but not on the nonneuronal BHK-21 cells. On the other hand, the low pH-dependent cell fusion of rabies virus does not seem to require such tissue-specific factor(s) (Mifune et a/., 1982; Whitt et al., 1991) . We suppose that the pH-independent fusogenic ability would be an in vitro marker of the pathogenic virus and would contribute to the efficient invasion of the virus into neuroblastoma cells in culture and possibly into neuronal cells in viva (see below). Many kinds of viruses, including paramyxoviruses and some members of human retroviruses like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are known to display pH-independent cell fusion activity (the ability to cause cell fusion at a neutral pH) and are assumed to have a conserved fusogenic domain in the viral envelope glycoproteins (Richardson et al., 1986) . We supposed that the rabies virus G protein should also have a similar fusogenic domain for displaying the cell fusion activity at a neutral pH. Accordingly, we looked in the primary sequence of rabies virus G protein for a possible consensus sequence, such as F-X-G-X-V/I-I/L-G, which was found at the N-terminus of F, protein of the paramyxoviruses as well as of gp41 of HIV-l. After all, we found a homologous sequence, ranging from positions 360 to 366 (360-F-N-G-l-l-L-G-366) of the G protein, locating 27 amino acids downstream from the position 333, which was also connected downstream by a similar hydrophobic sequence as that found in F, protein of paramyxoviruses (Fig. 9) . Accordingly, we assume that this homologous region found in rabies virus G protein may be a putative fusion domain (or a part of it). Tuffereau et al. (1989) pointed out that the presence of a positively charged amino acid (arginine or lysine) at position 333 is necessary for a crucial step of viral invasion to the neuronal cells. Our present study strongly indicates that arginine at position 333 is essential for the G protein-induced cell fusion at a neutral pH. We think that the arginine-333-containing region is not a receptor-binding site, but would work for efficient interactions of G protein with a presumed neuronal factor(s) on the cell, which is essential for pH-independent membrane fusion on the surface of neuronal cells in collaboration with other regions on the G protein molecule. One such collaborating region may be a neurotoxin-like sequence, located at positions 189-214, and another one a putative fusogenic domain as mentioned above. The former region is a sequence that resembles the toxic loop of snake venom neurotoxins (the loop in the toxin is known to be involved in binding to the acetylcholine-binding site on AChR molecule; Lentz et al., 1984) . It is of much interest to determine whether and how these three regions of the G protein (the region from 189 to 214, the arginine-333-containing region, and a putative fusogenic domain) collaborate in giant cell formation and possibly in viral invasion into the neuronal cells. Lentz et al. (1984) suggested that nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) might serve as a rabies virus receptor in viva, and the neurotoxin-like region of the rabies virus G protein might be involved in binding the virus to the nAChR-positive cells. We suppose that the neuronal cell-specific factor(s) induced in the sodium Comparison of the putative fusogenic domain of rabies virus G protein with that of the fusion proteins of other viruses. A hydrophobic region, a putative fusion domain, of the rabies virus G protein, ranging from positions 360 to 385, is compared with the presumed fusion domain (conserved hydrophobic region) of envelope proteins of the paramyxoviruses (F, protein) and human immunodeficiency virus (gp41 protein). Underlined are identical residues which are found both in rabies virus G protein and in either of four other envelope proteins listed. Hydrophobic amino acids are shaded.

We also suppose that pH-independent fusogenic ability would contribute to the efficient invasion of the virus into neuroblastoma cells in vitro (in our preliminary experiments, we observed that the pathogenic ERA virus could infect to the sodium butyrate-treated NA cells at a neutral pH in the presence of NH,CI which completely blocked the endocytosis-mediated viral invasion) and possibly into neuronal cells in the brain where the factor(s) might be present. This assumption seems to be consistent with previous reports of comparative studies on the behavior of pathogenic and nonpathogenic viruses in in vitro and in viva infections (Wunner et a/., 1984; Dietzschold et al., 1985; Kucera et al., 1985) . Wunner et a/. (1984) described that pathogenic and nonpathogenic viruses displayed no qualitative difference in the efficiency of the viral attachment to NA cells. In this case, however, NA cells were not pretreated with sodium butyrate. Dietzschold et al. (1985) reported that nonvirulent mutant viruses are deficient in cell-to-cell transmission in the mouse neuroblastoma cells. They also reported that the pathogenic viruses spread within the brain much more rapidly than the nonpathogenic viruses. Syncytium-forming ability at a neutral pH of the rabies virus G(Arg) protein in NA cell cultures may reflect such an efficient spread of the virulent type virus in the brain. On the other hand, Lafay et al. (1991) suggested recently that the pathogenic strain (CVS) of rabies virus should be able to bind several different kinds of receptors to penetrate neurons, while Avol (nonpathogenic virus) would be unable to recognize some of them. Accordingly, the requirement of the tissue-specific factor(s) for pH-independent fusogenic activity of the pathogenic virus may only reflect an aspect of the neurotropic nature of the virus. The details of this problem remain to be elucidated.",
