Ease of propagation and assay and lack of pathogenicity makes bacteriophages advantageous surrogate viruses (Sinclair et al., 2012) . Use of bacteriophages allows for larger sample sizes and reduced risk to human volunteers compared to pathogenic viruses (Grayson et al., 2008) , but surrogates for enveloped viruses are needed (Phillpotts et al., 2010) . One candidate bacteriophage that has been evaluated as a potential surrogate for influenza and other enveloped human viruses is the bacteriophage \u03a66 (Adcock et al., 2009 , Phillpotts et al., 2010 , Casanova and Waka, 2013 , Turgeon et al., 2014 . A member of the Cystoviridae and a phage of Pseudomonas, \u03a66 is a 13.5 kb segmented RNA virus with a lipid envelope (Laurinavi\u010dius et al., 2004) , giving it structural similarities to the Orthomyxoviridae (influenza), and Coronaviridae (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). Although \u03a66 is a potential surrogate, recommended methods for sampling hands for viruses in healthcare personnel handwash testing have been optimized for bacteria and non-enveloped viruses (ASTM, 2013a , ASTM, 2013b . There is a need to evaluate the efficacy of sampling methods for the recovery of enveloped viruses from hands. Therefore, the objective of this research is to evaluate a range of candidate eluent solutions, including protein, salt, and detergent-containing solutions, for their ability to recover \u03a66 during whole-hand sampling.",

N o was calculated by measuring the titer of virus in distilled water before application to the hand. N t is the quantity of virus present in eluent solution following hand sampling, expressed in PFU/mL. Data were analyzed with Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corp.), GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), and SAS v.9.3. Effects of eluent and trial on virus loss during sampling were analyzed using general linear models with Tukey-Kramer adjustment of p-values for all pairwise comparisons to protect against experiment-wise error rate inflation.",

Although results from the small sample size should be interpreted with caution, these results suggest that protein and detergent-based eluents may have similar recoveries, but recovery may still vary across repeated sampling. Recovery may be of lesser importance when evaluating hand hygiene agents as the methods for the evaluation of hand hygiene products compare the amount of virus recovered after hand hygiene with the amount of virus recovered from a baseline hand sample taken before any hand hygiene agents are applied (Grayson et al., 2008 , ASTM, 2013a , ASTM, 2013b . Theoretically, this should control for losses from sampling as the baseline and post-wash samplings will presumably undergo the same loss, but this study suggests that this assumption may not be valid in all cases. In handwashing studies, low recovery and high loss during baseline sampling may limit the log reduction that can detected in a particular experiment. Recovery efficiency of whole hand sampling methods is highly relevant for studies of survival and transfer on hands; poor recovery can lead to underestimation of transfer efficiency or viral survival.",

            "text": "There has been little examination in the literature of the possible influence of viral carryover during sequential samplings. We conducted experiments to determine if virus remained on hands after hand hygiene with non-antibacterial soap followed by decontamination with 70% ethanol, and no virus was detected during sampling following hand decontamination (data not shown). Also, if trial-to-trial carryover was an important contributor to the amount of virus recovered, we would expect to see a continual decrease in virus loss across multiple trials as the amount of virus accumulated with each trial. Our results do not suggest that this is the case; the differences seen appear to be chiefly between trial 1 and the subsequent ones; trials 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were not found to be significantly different from each other regardless of which eluent was used. It is possible that changes to the skin as a result of hand hygiene and sampling take place during the first trial. This may change the skin surface in some way that is either more conducive to viral survival or less conducive to viral attachment, leading to decreases in virus loss after the first trial. It has been suggested that natural skin oils on hands may affect influenza survival (Grayson et al., 2008) ; one possibility is that the reduction in oils on the surface of the skin from sampling and hand hygiene may create a more favorable environment for the survival of viruses on hands or a less favorable environment for viral attachment to the skin, leading to decreased virus loss after trial 1. However, it is difficult to say for certain what this effect is without measurements of what is happening on the surface of the hand, such as measurements of skin oils or skin drying. One possible study design to determine why trial effects are seen would be to have each volunteer participate twice. During their first participation, all six trials would be run with virus, as in the work described here. In their second participation, trial #1 would be run as usual, but with virus-free liquid applied to the hands. Trials 2-6 would then be conducted as usual, with virus. This would give some insight into whether the application of eluent solution alone during trial 1 is causing some changes in the skin that would lead to decreased virus loss in subsequent trials. Measurements of skin change (such as changes in skin oils or skin drying using conductance and capacitance measures) would also help determine whether skin changes are playing a role.",

For effective sampling of enveloped viruses thought needs to be given to the effects of multiple sampling on the same individual; further exploration is needed of the effect of replicate sampling, eluent, and changes to the skin surface on recovery from whole-hand sampling. The results of this work suggest that protein and polysorbate-based eluent solutions can recover an enveloped surrogate virus from hands during whole hand sampling; future work should evaluate protein-detergent combinations to determine if synergistic effects between the two can boost recovery. Based on current work, protein-based eluents such as beef extract can maximize recovery of enveloped viruses during hand sampling using the glove juice method.
