            "text": "Merchant et al., by using ung+ and ung-Escherichia coli strains, demonstrated that total nitric oxide exposures in the \u00b5mol/L range can lead to C\u2192T mutations by a mechanism probably involving cytosine deamination (8) . On the other hand, in M. smegmatis, the abrogation of the Ung activity leads not only to increased mutator phenotype but also to growth inhibition by reactive nitrogen intermediates (7) . In summary, I speculate that mutations in ung that do not completely impair function, but do decrease synthesis of its product, might tolerably increase the spontaneous C\u2192T mutations, including those in the respective positions in the rpoB codons 531 and 526. This assumption seems likely because both of the aforementioned particular mutations were described in spontaneous mutants of H37Rv obtained in vitro and had a Darwinian fitness slightly less than or equal to that of the rpoB wild-type-susceptible parental strain (9) . In contrast, the translesion synthesis-based pathways appear less likely to contribute to emergence of such mutants, although at least one of the translesion synthesis genes (dinP) is present in the genome of M. tuberculosis. In the E. coli in vitro model, a translesion synthesis enzyme (dinB encoded DNA polymerase IV) activity clearly promoted more important frameshift mutations (single-base deletions) in two thirds of the spontaneous mutants (10) .",

            "text": "From an evolutionary point of view, the multiple rpoB mutations in M. tuberculosis have been hypothesized to arise as a compensatory mechanism to ameliorate the fitness costs of the original resistance mutation by a secondary mutation (11) . The process of adaptation to the fitness costs of chromosomally encoded resistance has been studied in E. coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi for mutations that affect translation in the rpsL and fusR genes (11) and for rpoB mutations in E. coli K12 strain (11) . In the last instance, the rpoB multiple mutants were selected in vitro in a stepwise fashion, and one double mutant, L511Q+D516G (also described in M. tuberculosis strain [3] ), exhibited a relative fitness either greater than or equal to either single mutant or the wild type. Reynolds (11) suggested that this allele is favored not merely as a combination of two low-level resistance mutations but also because these mutations together boost resistance and preserve fitness. Whether the same is true for other multiple mutant alleles in M. tuberculosis rpoB remains to be seen. Studying the costs of resistance of multiple rpoB mutations in a more realistic environment of animal models of TB infection seems promising.",

Investigations were conducted on 90 episodes in 89 elderly patients, 62 males and 27 females, in which we found no other microorganisms that could have been related to the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RNA was extracted from the sputum samples and amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect HMPV as previously described (3) . Results of bacterial culture and culture and PCR to detect respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus types A and B were negative, whereas HMPV was found in the sputum of five (three men and two women) immunocompetent patients, 77-87 years of age. The prevalence of HMPV infection was 5.5%, similar to the percentage obtained by Chan et al., when HMPV RT-PCR was conducted on the respiratory samples. Fever (temperature >38\u00baC) was not present in any of the five patients infected with HMPV. Two patients were admitted to a hospital. Both patients had bronchial infection and cough with bronchospasm and moderate respiratory insufficiency (oxygen saturation rate: 90.3% and 88%, respectively) for >1 week. Sputum samples from an additional 70 elderly patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with positive detection for influenza virus (n = 50) or respiratory syncytial virus (n = 20) were tested for HMPV infection. None of the samples showed HMPV infection.",

Additional studies should be conducted to confirm that HMPV exacerbates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, by performing an RT-PCR directly on the sample instead of the more efficient RT-PCR after viral culture used by Chan et al., these findings suggest that HMPV is a frequently undetected agent in acute respiratory infection unrelated to SARS. The important questions are whether HMPV and SARS-CoV coinfection would facilitate more severe SARS, or whether HMPV infection would facilitate a more efficient transmission of SARS-CoV. ",

The selective pressure created by the widespread use of antimicrobial agents in animals and humans as prophylactic and therapeutic agents may have contributed to the dissemination of resistant bacterial strains. In 2000, the new serovar Keurmassar (35:c:1,2) of S. enterica, was described in Senegal (1). Integrons are efficient gene-capture systems by site-specific recombination and are involved in antimicrobial-drug resistance in gram-negative bacteria (2) . Three classes of integrons are well characterized and are involved in antimicrobial resistance. Integrons have been found in different nontyphoidal serovars of S. enterica and recently in serovar Typhi (3).We evaluated the contribution of integrons to the antimicrobial drug resistance of eight isolates of S. enterica serovar Keurmassar sent to the Senegalese National Salmonella and Shigella Reference Laboratory at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar from March to May 2000. One strain was isolated from poultry flesh, and seven strains were isolated from human stool or blood samples. Susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar according to the Comit\u00e9 de l'antibiogramme, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Microbiologie, recommendations. The eight strains expressed an extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase, which was previously identified as SHV-12 (1). The strains were also resistant to aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, netilmicin, spectinomycin, streptomycin, and",
