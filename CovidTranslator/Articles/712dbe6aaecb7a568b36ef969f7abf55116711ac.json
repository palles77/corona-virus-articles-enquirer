Numerous approaches have been developed in recent years, and in this section we briefly describe some successful strategies. Genome-wide approaches have emerged as a powerful means to identify the host factors involved in (+)RNA virus replication. For example, genome-wide screens of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (BOX 1) led to the identification of ~130 S. cerevisiae genes that affect the replication of tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) 23, 24 , ~30 genes that affect TBSV RNA recombination [25] [26] [27] , and ~100 genes that influence the replication of brome mosaic virus (BMV) 28 . Interestingly, only a small subset of S. cerevisiae genes affects replication of both BMV and TBSV, suggesting that these distantly related (+)RNA viruses depend on mostly different host factors and cellular processes 23, 24, 28 .",

This approach led to the identification of several hundred host genes that affect (+)RNA virus replication, but this is probably an underestimation owing to the considerable level of genetic redundancy in animals, the variable efficiency of the protein knockdowns, the diversity of experimental conditions and cell types used, and the possible 'off-target' effects of some small interfering RNAs (that is, unwanted silencing of nontarget genes). Further analysis of the functions of the identified genes will be necessary to confirm that they are indeed co-opted for viral replication.",

These data indicate that NS3 and NS5A might have crucial roles in reprogramming host cell metabolism during HCV infection through altering the cellular functions of the interacting host proteins. Proteomic approaches have also been used to identify host proteins that interact directly with the viral RNA of coronaviruses, alphaviruses and WNV (viral RNA was purified, and bound host proteins were then identified by mass spectrometry 9, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] ) and with the viral RNA of TBSV and BMV (using a protein microarray) 45, 46 .",

The resulting viral replication proteins then recruit the (+)RNA to subcellular membrane compartments, where functional viral replication complexes (VRCs) are assembled. A small amount of negative-sense RNA ((\u2212)RNA) is synthesized and serves as a template for the synthesis of a large number of (+)RNA progeny. The new (+)RNAs are released from the VRCs, whereas the (\u2212)RNA is retained.

Therefore, for replication to take place, the viral genomic RNA, together with viral and host factors, must be actively recruited to the appropriate subcellular membrane surfaces. Viral replication proteins can bind selectively to viral (+)RNA, which probably leads to recruitment of the viral RNA from translation to replication 54-59 . However, host proteins are also involved. For example, in the case of human poliovirus (PV), a central role for host poly(rC)binding protein 2 (PCBP2) in RNA template recruitment has been suggested (FIG. 2) . PCBP2 is an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA stabilization and the regulation of transcription and translation, and it binds to the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in PV (+)RNA to promote cap-independent translation. When bound to the viral RNA, PCBP2 is cleaved by the PV-encoded RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) precursor (3CD) or protease (3C) proteins and, as a result, loses one of its three RNA-binding sites. However, the cleaved form of PCBP2 retains two RNA-binding sites that allows the protein to bind to the cloverleaf structure at the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of PV (+)RNA (FIG. 2a) . This is crucial for PV RNA replication, as it brings together the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the viral RNA through interaction with another host protein family, the poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) 60,61 (FIG. 2a) . The PV-encoded 3CD is also involved in RNA template selection and in switching of the viral RNA from translation to replication by binding to the cloverleaf-like structure at the 5\u2032 UTR and influencing genome circularization 54,55,60,62,63 .",

TOM1 and TOM3 are also part of the ToMV VRC, in which they probably act as membrane anchors for the replication proteins 64,65 . Similarly, the human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA), a SNARE-like protein, might serve as a membrane anchor for HCV replication proteins. Indeed, VAPA interacts with the HCV replication proteins NS5A and NS5B 66 , an interaction that could be important for the association of NS5A and NS5B with the intracellular ER-derived membranes that constitute the site of HCV replication. Inhibiting the expression of VAPA, which is partially associated with lipid rafts, results in relocation of NS5B from detergent-resistant to detergent-sensitive membranes 67 . Detergent-resistant lipid rafts -cholesteroland sphingolipid-rich microdomains -in subcellular membranes could serve as nucleation sites to increase the local concentration of viral replication proteins and facilitate the selective binding of key host factors, ultimately leading to the formation of VRCs 67,68 .

The small genome size also means that there is a reduced level of redundancy. In addition, less than 7% of the genes carry introns, which greatly simplifies prediction of the encoded proteins. Moreover, toolboxes and gene libraries are available for the controlled expression of selected genes. One advantage to performing genome-wide screens in S. cerevisiae is the availability of collections of knockout mutants, such as the yeast single-gene-knockout (YKO) library, or libraries containing gene sets with regulated expression, such as the yTHC library 135 . Gene libraries with fluorescent tags or affinity tags for identification of the subcellular localization of proteins and for protein purification, respectively, are also available 136 . Microarray chips with DNA oligonucleotides for most S. cerevisiae genes, and protein arrays with 4,100 purified proteins from this organism, have been produced 137 .

This process seems to rely on the endosomal trafficking pathway and the actomyosin system 70 . It has been proposed that only a single genomic RNA molecule is transported in each vesicle 71 . TBSV requires the peroxisomal shuttle protein PEX19, which is necessary for the formation of the peroxisome membrane, and the chaperone heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) to target viral replication proteins to the peroxi some 72-75 . However, the peroxisomal membrane is not essential for TBSV replication, as TBSV RNA can replicate in a pex\u0394 S. cerevisiae strain, (which is defective in peroxisome biogenesis) as efficiently as in a wild-type strain 24, 76 . The finding that TBSV can replicate efficiently on the ER membrane in the absence of peroxisomes suggests that some RNA viruses have the flexibility to use different host membranes for their replication. In addition, TBSV replication proteins can be transported to the sites of replication in the form of multimolecular complexes that include viral RNA and some host factors 77 . Pre-organization of replication factors into multicomponent complexes in the cytoplasm is partly unwound by the chaperone activity of the host heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNPC) and the binding of PCBP2 and 3CD to the 5\u2032 end of the (+)RNA. After cleavage of 3CD, the released 3D-POL starts (+)RNA synthesis, which will go on for many rounds to produce excess amounts of (+)RNA progeny. b | PV begins replicating in the Golgi-TGN compartment. The virally encoded tail-anchored membrane protein 3A binds to the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) and promotes the degradation of the host general vesicular transport protein p115, preventing the recruitment of \u03b5-COP and \u03b2-COP (components of the vesicle coatomer complex 1, which surrounds transport vesicles in the early secretory pathway) to ERGIC. These events slow down vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi-TGN. The production of additional 3A molecules on the newly made PV (+)RNAs results in remodelling of the Golgi-TGN and ERGIC compartments into viral replication organelles (the VRCs). These organelles provide optimal replication for PV owing to the presence of an increased amount of the lipid phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), which is produced by the recruited host PtdIns4P synthesis enzyme, PtdIns4-kinase-\u03b2 (PI4KIII\u03b2). c | Trafficking between the ER and the Golgi in uninfected cells.

The probable role of GTP-bound ARF1 (the membrane-associated active form) is to recruit other cellular effector proteins to change the membrane curvature, induce the formation of transport vesicles from intracellular organelles and modify the lipid composition of membranes 83, 84 . It is likely that PV proteins 3A and 3CD act synergistically to reorganize the host secretory trafficking pathway in order to facilitate the formation of individual VRCs and replication organelles 82, 83 . Similar replication organelles are probably also formed during flaviviral infections 82 .",

The ER-bound HCV protein NS5A recruits the host kinase PI4KIII\u03b1 (also known as PI4K\u03b1), another protein involved in PtdIns4P synthesis 37, 85, 86 . NS5A binding stimulates PI4KIII\u03b1 kinase activity to enrich the membrane compartment with PtdIns4P 87 . The PtdIns4P-rich membrane can then facilitate the recruitment of additional host factors, such as oxysterolbinding protein 1 (OSBP1), which is required for HCV replication 88 . Both PI4KIII\u03b1 kinase and PtdIns4P are crucial for the formation and integrity of the membranous web structure of the HCV replication organelle 87 (FIG. 3a) . Remarkably, both PV and HCV seem to use PtdIns4P enrichment to create a favourable microenvironment for RNA replication, but they co-opt different cellular kinases to do so. One possible explanation for this is the availability of these host kinases in different subcellular compartments. For example, ER-bound NS5A co-opts PI4KIII\u03b1 kinase, which is also ER localized and thus likely to be readily available. By contrast, PV co-opts the Golgi-localized PI4KIII\u03b2, which could be available in the ERGIC compartment (FIG. 2) . The mechanisms used by HCV and PV for PtdIns4P enrichment of cellular membranes provide a good illustration of a common theme in the biology of (+)RNA viruses: different host proteins can be co-opted by different viruses to provide mechanistically similar functions during viral replication.",

            "text": "In addition, coronaviruses induce the formation of interconnected double-membraned vesicles (DMVs) 89 by exploiting a regulatory pathway that controls ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) 90 . Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, seems to prevent degradation of the short-lived ER chaperones ER degradation-enhancing \u03b1-mannosidase-like 1 (EDEM1) and OS9, which are crucial regulators of ERAD, by trapping them in structures called edemosomes (FIG. 4) . It has been hypothesized that the accumulation of MHV replication proteins in edemosomes, which are decorated with LC3-I (non-lipidated microtubule-associated proteins 1A and 1B light chain 3A; a homologue of yeast Atg8, a ubiquitin-like protein that is required for the formation of autophagosomal membranes), transforms these structures into permanent DMVs 90 . The coronaviral replication proteins nsp2 and nsp3 are colocalized with LC3-I on the surface of DMVs during the entire course of MHV infection. Indeed, depletion of LC3 (which results in a reduction of both the lipidated form, LC3-II, and the non-lipidated form) by RNAi severely inhibits DMV formation and MHV replication 90 . The actual function of DMVs has not been fully defined, but they could be the sites of viral replication and virion assembly. The viral content could be released from DMVs by fusion with other membranes or by disintegration of the DMV membranes. (FIG. 3b,c) . Moreover, the interaction between NS3 and FASN results in increased FASN activity 91 . This leads to de novo synthesis of fatty acids that then integrate into the ER and DENV VRC membranes, suggesting that the local synthesis of fatty acids facilitates the expansion of the ER and the formation of DENV VRCs in infected cells. DENV also increases the amount of free fatty acids derived from lipid droplets in mammalian cells by inducing autophagy 49 . The released free fatty acids become available for the assembly of DENV VRCs and lead to an increase in cellular ATP, as they are metabolized by \u03b2-oxidation in the mitochondria. Increased ATP is expected to enhance cellular processes and stimulate DENV replication 49 . Thus, DENV and the closely related HCV seem to rely on the local enrichment of different lipids (fatty acids versus PtdIns4P) to promote the assembly of VRCs. These differences could be explained by the different cell types or hosts infected by these viruses (HCV infects liver cells in humans, whereas DENV not only infects humans and non-human primates but also persists in the mosquito vector), which could dictate the available lipid synthesis pathways. The generation of new membrane surfaces via fatty acid biosynthesis also has a major effect on Drosophila C virus replication in Drosophila melano gaster cells: depletion of host HLH106, a protein that regulates fatty acid metabolism, blocks the formation of Drosophila C virus-induced vesicular compartments 16 . In addition, in S. cerevisiae inactivation of the gene encoding Ole1, a fatty acid \u03949-desaturase that participates in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, reduces the activity of the BMV replicase, probably owing to reduced binding of one of the replicase components (BMV replication protein 1a) to membranes with a lower ratio of unsaturated fatty acids 92 . This results in reduced efficiency of VRC assembly and a low level of replication.",

Indeed, dynamic The virus-encoded replication protein non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) binds to human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAPA), which, together with NS4B, seems to be important for the association of NS5A and NS5B with cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in the ER-derived membranes. The membrane-bound NS5A then recruits and activates the host kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-\u03b1 (PI4KIII\u03b1), which leads to an enrichment of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) that could facilitate recruitment of oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP1) and the formation of the sterol-rich 'membranous web' to support HCV replication. The high concentration of PtdIns4P probably also facilitates the recruitment of additional host factors to the membranous web. The viral protein NS4B is also important for the formation of the membranous web, possibly by inducing membrane curvature (not shown). b | Electron micrograph of the viral replication complexes (VRCs) induced during dengue virus (DENV) infections. The white arrowhead indicates a DENV-induced vesicle in the ER with an opening towards the nuclear envelope; the black arrowhead points to a virus particle in a cisterna close to a Golgi stack. c | Three-dimensional modelling of the VRCs induced during DENV infections. The arrow indicates a putative virus budding site, and red spheres represent remodelling and deforming of membranes to give rise to unique spherule structures seem to require host proteins. For example, tombusviruses recruit ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) proteins 24 , which have a major role in sorting cargo proteins from the endosomes to multivesicular bodies by membrane invagination and vesicle formation [108] [109] [110] [111] . Recruitment of ESCRT proteins for TBSV replication might facilitate VRC assembly, including the formation of TBSV-induced spherules (FIG. 5) and vesicles in infected plant cells 52 . Accordingly, the ubiquitylated TBSV p33 was found to interact with S. cere visiae vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 23 (Vps23; an ESCRT-I protein) and Bro1 (an accessory ESCRT factor) 52, 112 , resulting in the recruitment of Vps23 and possibly Bro1 to peroxisomes, the sites of TBSV replication. This is followed by the recruitment of ESCRT-III proteins (Snf7 and Vps24), which could assist optimal assembly of the VRC, facilitate colocalization of the viral replication proteins p33 and p92 within selected areas in the membrane, and promote the formation of viral spherules by deforming the membranes or stabilizing the 'neck' structure (the narrow opening in the spherules that faces the cytosol) (FIG. 5) . It seems that protection of the viral RNA is compromised if the VRC assembles in the absence of ESCRT proteins 52 . Thus, ESCRT proteins appear to affect the quality of VRC assembly by contributing to the protection of viral RNA from ribonucleases.",

For example, elongation factor 1\u03b1 (eEF1\u03b1), which is a highly abundant cellular protein that delivers the aminoacyl-tRNA to the elongating ribosome, is a permanent resident of the tombusvirus VRC and binds to the 3\u2032 UTR of the TBSV RNA (in yeast, this is the TEF1 and TEF2 forms of eEF1\u03b1, but in plants and mammals the specific form of eEF1\u03b1 involved is not yet known) 46 . Mutational analysis of eEF1\u03b1, in combination with in vitro replication studies, suggests that eEF1\u03b1 promotes (\u2212)RNA synthesis by the tombusvirus VRC by binding to both the RdRp and the 3\u2032 UTR of the (+)RNA molecule, thus facilitating the proper positioning of the RdRp on the template RNA for efficient initiation of RNA synthesis 123 . Similarly, eEF1\u03b1 binds to the 3\u2032 UTR of the (+)RNA of WNV, and certain mutations introduced at the eEF1\u03b1-binding sites of the viral RNA inhibit both (+)RNA-eEF1\u03b1 binding and (\u2212)RNA synthesis 21, 124 . Moreover, eEF1\u03b1 colocalizes with the WNV VRC in infected cells, indicating that eEF1\u03b1 facilitates the interaction between the viral replicase and the WNV RNA 3\u2032 UTR 125 . The involvement of eEF1\u03b1 in viral (+)RNA replication might be common, as eEF1\u03b1 binds to many viral (+)RNAs and replication proteins, and its high abundance in cells might facilitate its recruitment for viral replication. Indeed, the bacterial homologue of eEF1\u03b1, termed EF-Tu, is known to affect (\u2212)RNA synthesis for the bacteriophage Q\u03b2 126, 127 , suggesting that subversion of eEF1\u03b1-like host proteins by (+)RNA viruses might be an ancient process.",

Downregulation of GAPDH inhibits TBSV replication in S. cerevisiae and in plants and results in production of (+)RNAs and (-)RNAs in a 1:1 ratio, instead of asymmetric RNA synthesis 133 . GAPDH might promote asymmetric RNA synthesis by selectively anchoring the (\u2212)RNA template to the VRC, allowing efficient access of the (\u2212)RNA replication intermediate to viral RdRp, whereas (+)RNA progeny (which are not bound by GAPDH) are released from VRC into the cytosol 133 .

Inactivation of PMR1 increases the rate of TBSV RNA recombination and replication 53 . It has been proposed that the viral replicase uses the far more abundant Mg 2+ over Mn 2+ when Pmr1 works efficiently (that is, at low cytosolic Mn 2+ concentrations), leading to a normal replication rate and low-frequency RNA recombination 53 . However, inhibiting Pmr1 increases the level of cytosolic Mn 2+ , promoting more efficient use of Mn 2+ by the viral replicase, resulting in an increased replication rate and highfrequency RNA recombination.

In vitro reconstitution of VRCs would be extremely useful for the dissection of unknown functions of the host proteins that are co-opted for viral replication. Super-resolution imaging and electron tomography to determine the position and orientation of host proteins within VRCs will advance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in (+)RNA virus replication. In addition, proteomics can be used to study the possible roles of posttranslational modifications of viral replication proteins. These advances should lead to a better understanding of viral replication and the interactions between host factors and (+)RNA viruses, which are key aspects of viral pathogenesis.

As a result of the interaction between PCBP2 and PABP, the ends of the PV RNA genome are brought into proximity, facilitating the cleavage of 3CD and the release of the RdRp (3D-POL). 3D-POL then starts synthesis of the negative-sense RNA ((-)RNA) using VPg-UU (di-uridylated VPg protein) as a primer.
