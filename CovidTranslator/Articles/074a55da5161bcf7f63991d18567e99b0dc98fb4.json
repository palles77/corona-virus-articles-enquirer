The VRC 319 trial, done in three centres, assessed plasmid VRC5288 (Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus chimera), and the VRC 320, done in one centre, assessed plasmid VRC5283 (wild-type Zika virus). Eligible participants were aged 18-35 years in VRC19 and 18-50 years in VRC 320. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 by a computer-generated randomisation schedule prepared by the study statistician. All participants received intramuscular injection of 4 mg vaccine. In VRC 319 participants were assigned to receive vaccinations via needle and syringe at 0 and 8 weeks, 0 and 12 weeks, 0, 4, and 8 weeks, or 0, 4, and 20 weeks. In VRC 320 participants were assigned to receive vaccinations at 0, 4, and 8 weeks via single-dose needle and syringe injection in one deltoid or split-dose needle and syringe or needle-free injection with the Stratis device (Pharmajet, Golden, CO, USA) in each deltoid. Both trials followed up volunteers for 24 months for the primary endpoint of safety, assessed as local and systemic reactogenicity in the 7 days after each vaccination and all adverse events in the 28 days after each vaccination. The secondary endpoint in both trials was immunogenicity 4 weeks after last vaccination. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02840487 and NCT02996461.",

All local and systemic symptoms were mild to moderate. In both studies, pain and tenderness at the injection site was the most frequent local symptoms (37 [46%] of 80 participants in VRC 319 and 36 [80%] of 45 in VRC 320) and malaise and headache were the most frequent systemic symptoms (22 [27%] and 18 [22%], respectively, in VRC 319 and 17 [38%] and 15 [33%], respectively, in VRC 320). For VRC5283, 14 of 14 (100%) participants who received split-dose vaccinations by needle-free injection had detectable positive antibody responses, and the geometric mean titre of 304 was the highest across all groups in both trials.",

In December, 2015, the Pan American Health Organization and WHO issued an alert linking Zika virus infection with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and congenital malformations, including microcephaly. WHO later declared Zika virus to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 10 The causal links between Zika virus infection with these syndromes are supported, 11 but the mechanism of infection-related microcephaly is un known and its epidemiology is complex. 12 As no effective treatments are yet available and infection is often sub clinical, development of a preventive vaccine is urgently needed.",

When these proteins are expressed in mammalian cells, they assemble into subviral particles that are non-infectious but have structural and antigenic similarities to virion particles and can induce protective immune responses. 20, 21 Because preclinical studies were being done in parallel with manufacturing, initial product choice was based on in-vitro data and the final choice was based on animal model data.

Outbreaks in the Pacific region and Brazil led to its recognition as an emerging infectious disease. Previously unknown sequelae of Zika virus infection, most notably congenital abnormalities, served as the impetus for accelerated vaccine development. The Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, has experience in developing vaccines to protect against emerging infectious diseases, in general, especially against flaviviruses. We searched PubMed with the terms \"Zika virus\", \"Zika vaccine\", \"flavivirus\", and \"DNA vaccine.\" We did not use any other search parameters. We also used news alerts from WHO, Pan American Health Organization, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify reports. We retrieved 11 445 papers. Two papers provided evidence for immunogenicity and safety of the DNA vaccine platform, given via a needle-free injector system of administration for a different flavivirus (West Nile virus). The DNA vaccine platform was attractive in this context because it allowed for the modification of a previously validated plasmid backbone, which helped facilitate rapid preclinical development, manufacturing, and regulatory approval of a first-in-human vaccine candidate. We also found that using a needle-free injection device could augment immune responses to DNA vaccines compared with administration via needle and syringe.",

Administration of the VRC5283 vaccine by needle-free injection resulted in the highest magnitude humoral and cellular responses. While these clinical data indicate that the DNA vaccine candidates are viable options for use against Zika virus infection, additional clinical trials are needed to further the development of VRC5283 and to determine efficacy in at-risk populations.

This Japanese encephalitis virus sequence was used because it improved the release of subviral particles in non-human primates, which was thought to have potential for improving immunogenicity, but, without surface exposure on mature particles, were not expected to contribute otherwise to the induction of protective immunity to Japanese encephalitis virus. 22 In non-human primates, the two Zika virus vaccine candidates induced robust neutralising antibody res ponses after two doses given 4 weeks apart. 17 of 18 animals who received two 4 mg doses of VRC5288 or two 4 mg or 1 mg doses of VRC5283 were protected from viraemia following Zika virus challenge 8 weeks after vaccination. 22 The animal that broke through received two 4 mg doses of VRC5288.

The proportions of total CD4 and CD8 T cells producing interleukin 2, interferon \u03b3, tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, or a combination of these cytokines, were quantified. Boolean gating was done and all cytokinepositive gates were summed to calculate the total proportion of cytokine-positive cells responding to a peptide pool.

For example, neutralising activity is an established correlate of protection for most licensed flavivirus vaccines. 25 In studies of VRC5288 and VRC5283 in non-human primates, neutralising activity correlated with protection against viraemia following vaccination and Zika virus challenge. 22 Additionally, the role of antibody-mediated protection against Zika virus infection is supported by protection against infection after adoptive transfer of purified IgG from mice vaccinated with a DNA vaccine against Zika virus into CD4 and CD8 T-cell-depleted mice. 26 In addition to humoral immunity, cellular immunity might be relevant, particularly because CD8 T-cell responses have been detected in human beings after flavivirus infections. [27] [28] [29] With this in mind, the DNA vaccine platform has an advantage over protein-based vaccines because it induces antibody and substantial T-cell responses. CD4 T-cell responses are necessary for optimum memory B-cell response, and CD8 T cells are thought to facilitate viral clearance important to fetal protection. 30 Based on our findings, VRC5283 was more promising than VRC5288 to advance into later stage development because 100% (14 of 14) of participants who received the vaccine by needle-free injection in split doses had detectable antibody responses and had neutralising antibody and T-cell responses of the greatest magnitude. Additionally, CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were greater with VRC5283 than VRC5288. Since VRC5288 encodes the Japanese encephalitis virus E transmembrane sequence, some cellular immune responses induced by vaccination might have been specific to this virus and not captured by our intracellular cytokine staining assay or might not have been able to respond to Zika virus. The wild-type Zika virus E transmembrane protein in the VRC5283 plasmid might, therefore, elicit cellular immune responses to this region, giving this vaccine a further advantage.",

Needle-free injectors are known to augment DNA vaccine response, possibly by increased dispersion of injectate or through tissue damage that increases immunogenicity. 31 The GMT after split-dose needle-free delivery of VRC5283 was six times higher than that after single-dose delivery via needle and syringe. The number of injections was also important, as the GMT achieved after VRC5283 was given in split doses via needle and syringe was two to three times greater than those seen with VRC5288 or VRC5283 given in single doses by the same vaccination schedule. The VRC 319 trial used only needle and syringe delivery and, therefore, we could not compare specific variables responsible for different outcomes between the two trials. In non-human primate studies, however, VRC5288 and VRC5283 were both administered by needle-free injection, and VRC5283 prevented viraemia more effectively than VRC5288. 22 The antibodies induced by each vaccine are being investigated for qualitative differences that might contribute to their differing protective capacity. Additionally, dosereduction studies for VRC5283 in non-human primates are being done to define the serological correlate of protection from viraemia. Based on all the available information and the need for a shortened assessment schedule, VRC5283 has been advanced into an international placebo-controlled phase 2 efficacy trial of vaccination at 0, 4, and 8 weeks via needle-free delivery with the Stratis device (NCT03110770).

The plaque reduction neutralisation test and the microneutralisation assay, however, assess entry and spread of replicating virus in cell culture, and might be unable to detect replication-competent virus that is not neutralised at any concentration. In a phase 1 trial of another Zika virus DNA vaccine, neither the plaque reduction neutralisation test nor the microneutralisation assay predicted whether passively transferred human sera would protect mice against Zika virus challenge. 32 Ultimately, efficacy data from field trials will be needed to establish reliable correlates of protection that can be used to refine sufficient doses and schedules for effective immunity.",

Randomsied placebo-controlled efficacy trials in volunteers from regions where Zika virus and other flaviviruses are endemic are still needed. An important limitation in the development of any Zika virus vaccine is the lack of established correlates of protection from fetal malformations. Whether established correlates of protection from clinical disease in non-teratogenic flaviviruses will be predictive of prevention of fetal disease with Zika virus is unknown. Whether completely preventing viraemia, reducing peak viraemia, or preventing persistent viraemia in pregnant mothers will provide sufficient fetal protection is also unknown. Similar to the situation for congenital rubella syndrome in the 1960s, sustained epidemiological surveillance of large populations of vaccinated individuals will be needed to confirm effects on congenital infection.",

VRC5283 showed the most robust neutralising antibody and T-cell responses, and has been advanced into an international phase 2 efficacy trial. Several other vaccine approaches are also being pursued. Findings from a human study of another DNA vaccine have been reported, 32 and an inactivated vaccine is being assessed in human beings (NCT02963909). Differing vaccines might be designed for distinct target populations, provide various immune response patterns, and varying durability. As the joint efforts continue and knowledge of the immune response to Zika virus deepens, guidance on developing a definitive solution to the epidemic will improve.",
