In this study, a microwave assisted nanofibrous air filtration system was developed to disinfect air containing airborne pathogens. Aerosolized E. coli vegetative cells and B. subtilis endospores, as benign surrogates of pathogens, were collected on nanofibrous filters and treated by microwave irradiation. Both static on-filter and dynamic in-flight tests were carried out. Results showed that E. coli cells were efficiently disinfected in both static and inflight tests, whereas B. subtilis endospores were more resistant to this treatment. Microwave power level was found to be the major factor determining the effectiveness of disinfection. Both thermal and non-thermal effects of microwave irradiation contributed to the disinfection. Reducing flow velocity to decrease heat loss yielded higher disinfection efficiency.",

            "text": "After the anthrax attacks in 2001, concerns regarding infectious bioaerosols in public safety have been brought to light. Bioaerosols vary in size from submicron to a few hundred microns. More specifically, bacteria and fungal spores have sizes ranging from 0.3 to 30 mm, whereas viruses are smaller, ranging from 20 to 300 nm (Hinds, 1999) . Through aerosolization, large amounts of biological agents can be dispersed over a wide area in a very short period of time (Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2008) . One can also inexpensively contaminate an entire building by spraying bioaerosol into its ventilation system; for example, a medical nebulizer can be purchased by less than $2. Hence, aerosolization is deemed as one of the most effective methods for biological attacks (Henderson, 1998; Kortepeter & Parker, 1999) and measures to counter such attacks are necessary. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the long-lasting threat of avian flu and the recent outbreak of the H1N1 Influenza A virus have also raised public awareness of the need to protect the public from natural bioaerosols. In addition, exposure to concentrated airborne microorganisms is associated with allergenic diseases (Jo & Seo, 2005; Ren, Jankun, & Leaderer, 1999) . All these are calling for better control of exposure to bioaerosols albeit intentionally released or natural (Douwes, Thorne, Pearce, & Heederik, 2003; Lee, Wu, Wysocki, Farrah, & Wander, 2008) . Filtration is one of the most commonly applied methods for air purification. Due to their simple structure and low cost, fibrous air filters are among the most popular ones (Yun et al., 2007) . Nanofibrous filtration media have small fiber size, allowing integration of small pore size and large surface areas. Gas slip occurs on nanofibers, which reduces air resistance (Li, Wu, Tepper, Lee, & Lee, 2009; Zhang et al., 2009) . All these advantages make nanofiber filtration a promising alternative to existing filters (Barhate & Ramakrishna, 2007) . However, air filters alone may not provide sufficient protection against pathogenic bioaerosols, if the captured microorganisms are reentrained into the air. Therefore, it is necessary to add a treatment to the filters to inactivate the microorganisms. Ultraviolet (UV) light is effective in killing bacteria but has limitations on spores (Nicholson, Schuerger, & Setlow, 2005) , whereas for a biocidal filter the active chemical is consumed (e.g. by vaporization or reaction) over time (Lee, Wu, Wysocki, Farrah, & Wander, 2008) . A remedy to this issue is microwave disinfection. Microwave is an electromagnetic wave with frequencies ranging from 300 MHz to 300 GHz (Jones, Lelyveld, Mavrofidis, Kingman, & Miles, 2002) . Volumetric heating, selective heating, and hot-spot effect distinguish microwave heating from conventional heating (Zhang & Hayward, 2006) .",

            "text": "Since the mid-1980s, microwave induced/assisted reactions have been studied and widely applied. Among these microwave assisted reactions is the use of microwave irradiation for killing microorganisms (Apostolou et al., 2005; Celandroni et al., 2004; Vaid & Bishop, 1998) . Some researchers, especially those among earlier research studies, believe that the microwave inactivates the microbes solely through thermal effects. Goldblith and Wang (1967) studied the effect of microwave irradiation on Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and failed to detect any non-thermal effects. Jeng, Kaczmarek, Woodworth and Balasky (1987) found no significant non-thermal effects in a dry microwave disinfection process. Fujikawa et al. (1992) investigated the kinetics of E. coli destruction by microwave irradiation and found the difference between microwave exposure and conventional heating was not remarkable. Meanwhile, other studies have reported their observations of non-thermal effect during microwave disinfection of microorganisms. They distinguished the non-thermal effect through examination of damaged cells (Campanha et al., 2007; Celandroni et al., 2004) , distorted membrane structure and function (Persson, Salford, Brun, Eberhard, & Malmgren, 1992; Phelan, Neubauer, Timm, Neirenberg, & Lange, 1994) , increased release of Ca 2 + , K + , DNA, dipicolinic acid and protein (Campanha et al., 2007; Celandroni et al., 2004; Vaid & Bishop, 1998) and altered the enzyme activities (Dreyfuss & Chipley, 1980) after microwave irradiation. Betti et al. (2004) acknowledged the disruption of weak bonds in active protein forms, enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, and cell-signaling pathway interference to microwave non-thermal effects. Watanabe et al. (2000) found that the ionic strength can affect the microwave disinfection rate of microbes and linked the effect to the current within the cells generated by microwave.",

After collection, the filter was taken out of the filter holder and cut into four equal quadrants. Because the ACF mat could ignite in air during microwave irradiation, the PAN nanofiber layer was peeled off the ACF mat. One of the quadrants was directly inoculated into 50 mL of Ringer's solution and vortexed to extract the microorganisms. This inoculated solution was serially diluted, plated and incubated at 37 1C for 24 h. The number of colony forming unit (CFU) on the plates was then counted. Only plates with between 30 and 300 units were counted. The remaining quadrants were placed between two SiC disks (Vesuvius, 47 mm OD \u00c2 20 mm thickness, 45 PPI, OBSIC, lot no.: AL7370101L) and heated in the microwave oven for varying periods of time (30, 45, 60 and 90 s) to determine the microwave disinfection efficiency and to ascertain how long it would take to completely sterilize the bioaerosols by microwave irradiation. SiC disks were used because they are a good microwave absorber and can be quickly heated by microwaves. After microwave irradiation, the quadrants were also inoculated into the Ringer's solution and cultured as described above. In the case that had no plate with more than 30 colonies, the plate of the lowest dilution level was analyzed. The survival fraction (S) on the filter was then calculated as S = c t /c 0 , where c t is the viable bioaerosol concentration of the quadrant treated in microwave for time t, and c 0 is the viable bioaerosol concentration of the quadrant without microwave treatment. Additionally, to verify that the 4 quadrants collected similar amounts of microorganisms, a triplicate set of control tests (where all of the 4 quadrants were not microwaved) were carried out for E. coli. Results showed that the average coefficient of variation (CV) was 32%. Hence, the deviations are insignificant considering that microwave disinfection is measured logarithmically.",

After the dilution dryer, the air flow was split equally into three paths of 4 LPM each. The first path was directed to the quartz filter holder inside the microwave oven. The pressure drop across the filter was monitored by a differential pressure gauge and the flow rate across the microwave/filtration system was adjusted according to the pressure drop. The corresponding face velocity across the filter holder was 5.3 cm/s based on the effective filter diameter in the holder (40 mm). The second 4 LPM split stream was directed to a filter holder outside the microwave oven with an identical filter type as was present in the microwave oven. The third split stream was directed to a Biosampler (SKC, Eighty-Four, PA) without any filter to determine the feed concentration. A vacuum pump (Model no.: RVE56B17F5305A, Marathon Electric, WI) was used to draw air from the system in order to prevent pressure built up in glass joints, which would otherwise be forced apart.

The dynamic in-flight disinfection (the F1/F2 value) of E. coli as a function of microwave application time at three microwave power levels is displayed in Fig. 2 . When 500 W microwave power was used, at least 3.7 logs of the viable E. coli were disinfected regardless of whether the microwave was applied to the system continuously (10 min per 10-min-cycle), or periodically (5 or 2.5 min per 10-min-cycle). This suggests that 2.5 min per cycle is sufficient to disinfect the E. coli. At a lower power level, less disinfection was achieved. A two-way ANOVA test using Minitab 15 statistical package identified that the microwave power was the major factor that affects the E. coli disinfection (p-value= 0.003). On the other hand, the microwave application time did not exhibit a significant influence (p-value40.3). Experiments were then carried out without the use of filters. Under continuous 500 W microwave power, about 1.3 logs of E. coli were lost during flight across the microwave field (i.e. filter holder in the microwave oven). The corresponding exposure time to microwave was less than 5 s, which most likely resulted in a limited heating effect. This is suggested by the calculations of Canals et al. (1999) where a micrometer sized aerosol was found to experience a temperature increase of only 1 K for a 5 s residence time in a relatively strong microwave field. The results suggest direct microwave nonthermal effect can disinfect biological agents to certain extent, at least for vegetative cells like E. coli.",

Comparing to the E. coli results, spore disinfection is still less effective. This result is likely attributed to the heat resistivity of the endospores. Although complete disinfection could potentially be achieved by increasing the microwave power further, the durability of the filter in such conditions was a concern. Irradiation at 750 W for extended periods of time was found to degrade the mechanical efficiency of even the crosslinked PAN filter.

Hence, experiments were conducted to decrease face velocity during irradiation (at the same microwave power level) to verify the hypothesis. For the 750 W and 1.25 min condition, decreasing the face velocity 50% during irradiation resulted in an increase of 0.636 log removal of spores. This result provides evidence that heat conduction to the flow affects microbial inactivation on the filter.

However, in the present study, because of the high retention of the nanofiber filters, it was not possible to extract enough viable particles from the filter in order to yield a control plate with more than 10 5 CFU of E. coli. Hence, disinfection of more than 5 logs was not achievable in the present study.

Because a different heating medium and setup was used, it is not appropriate to compare their results directly to the present study. In the previous study, spores were suspended in a solution during irradiation while in this study spore aerosols were collected on microwave transparent PAN fibers which required SiC disks for heating. Although fiber heating occurred by conduction with the SiC disks rather than direct heating by radiation, the SiC disks were able to reach a much higher temperature than boiling water near 100 1C.
