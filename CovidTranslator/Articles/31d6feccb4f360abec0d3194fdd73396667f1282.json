            "text": "The 2019-2020 influenza sentinel surveillance data exhibits unexpected trends. Typical influenza seasons have a small herald wave, followed by a decrease due to school closure during holidays, and then a main post-holiday peak that is significantly larger than the pre-holiday wave. During the 2019-2020 influenza season, influenza-like illness data in the United States appears to have a markedly lower main epidemic peak compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak. We hypothesize that the 2019-2020 influenza season does have a lower than expected burden and that this deflation is due to a behavioral or ecological interaction with COVID-19. We apply an intervention analysis to assess if this influenza season deviates from expectations, then we compare multiple hypothesized drivers of the decrease in influenza in a spatiotemporal regression model. Lastly, we develop a mechanistic metapopulation model, incorporating transmission reduction that scales with COVID-19 risk perception. We find that the 2019-2020 ILI season is smaller and decreases earlier than expected based on prior influenza seasons, and that the increase in COVID-19 risk perception is associated with this decrease. Additionally, we find that a 5% average reduction in transmission is su cient to reproduce the observed flu dynamics. We propose that precautionary behaviors driven by COVID-19 risk perception or increased isolation driven by undetected COVID-19 spread dampened the influenza season. We suggest that when surveillance for a novel pathogen is limited, surveillance streams of co-circulating infections may provide a signal.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by a novel coronavirus were identified in Wuhan, China. In the months since, the now-termed COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread around the world, leading to hundreds of thousands of cases in over 160 countries [1] . The first evidence of community spread of SARS-Cov-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, in the United States appeared in February 2020. Since then, there have been widespread workplace, school, and business closures to dampen transmission [2] . Preceding this widespread policy response, individuals, informed by massive media coverage, engaged in voluntary behaviors such as increased handwashing and social distancing [3] . Such non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are known 1 to play a significant role in diminishing transmission, and are expected to be particularly important against SARS-Cov-2 as the virus appears to transmit for up to two weeks before symptoms appear [4] . Indeed, NPIs have been very e\u21b5ective in reducing the potential number of COVID-19 cases in China [5, 6] . As the COVID-19 outbreak unfolds, it is important to empirically understand the e\u21b5ects of NPIs on infection spread, and characterize the potential interaction between COVID-19 and other circulating respiratory infections. As the spread of COVID-19 in the United States has been temporally coincidental with the influenza season, and both infections share the same transmission pathways and NPIs, we focus on influenza as a case study.",

Typical ILI dynamics in an influenza season exhibit a small pre-holiday peak, followed by a larger post-holiday peak [7] . Recent ILI data for the United States show a markedly lower epidemic peak for the 2019-2020 influenza season compared to what would be expected based on the pre-holiday peak [8] . A similar phenomenon has been observed in other locations including Hong Kong and France [9, 10] . Understanding this uncharacteristic ILI behavior is important for understanding influenza epidemiology and optimizing influenza mitigation e\u21b5orts. Assessing ILI dynamics in the US in the time of COVID-19 also provides a useful tool to understanding the ecological interaction between these two respiratory infections which share transmission pathways and interventions, as well as to gain a better understanding of COVID-19 dynamics and control.",

Briefly, this method uses data from control time series to construct structural models for a counterfactual time series, or what is projected to occur if a disruption (\"intervention\") had not occurred. In particular, we use past influenza seasons as controls to characterize counterfactual 2019-2020 influenza season dynamics if COVID-19 risk perception had not occurred; the comparison between this counterfactual influenza time series and the true influenza time series for 2019-2020 allow us to identify any deviations from expectations. We used three control time series of previous influenza seasons (the 2015-2016, 2008-2009, and 2002-2003 seasons) individually, and together. The disruption initiated by COVID-19 was modeled as an \"intervention\" starting February 3, 2020. Thus, we considered October 7, 2019 to February 3, 2020 as the pre-intervention period, and February 10, 2020 to March 2, 2020 as the post-intervention period.",

The model is described in detail in [7] . We simulated a seasonal influenza epidemic in the US, including typical holiday school closure, and seasonality with the season ending at April 30, 2020. We then incorporated reduction in age-structured transmission by (1 \u2327 (t)), where is the intensity of transmission decrease, which relates to the increase in risk perception level of \u2327 (t). We parameterize \u2327 (t) based on daily Google trends for COVID-19 and fit to assess the degree to which influenza transmission is reduced in the early stages of COVID-19 in the US. We consider two main possible mechanisms by which COVID-19 may have resulted in decreased transmission: 1) increased risk perception of respiratory transmitted disease resulting in precautionary behaviors, like increased handwashing, that reduce potentially transmissible contacts and 2) isolation of infected individuals, either due to undetected COVID-19 spread, or increased messaging surrounding remaining home if one is feeling ill for any reason.",

This conjecture is supported by past studies that have shown that risk perception is a strong predictor of preventative health behaviors [21] . However, the timing of this e\u21b5ect (early to mid February) is important to consider. The decrease in the observed US ILI peak occurred before widespread closures of public spaces and implementation of social distancing to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. Our results could indicate that the use of personal NPIs such as handwashing and voluntary social distancing may have been occurring before policy changes took place in March 2020. In a survey conducted in early February 2020, US respondents rated their risk perception of COVID-19 as a median score of 5 out of 10, and more than 90% of participants were aware of infection prevention measures [22] . Our mechanistic model suggests that an average of 5% reduction in transmission likelihood could result in the ILI dynamics observed of the 2019-2020 season. Past studies have shown that frequent, e\u21b5ective handwashing can result in a comparable moderate reduction in infections [23, 24, 25] . A meta-analysis of the e\u21b5ects of NPIs in reducing influenza transmission demonstrated that hand hygiene was significant in reducing influenza transmission, with an odds ratio of 0.62 [26] .",

Past work has shown isolation to be e\u21b5ective in reducing transmission [30, 31] , and our mechanistic model results suggest that even a small reduction in the susceptible pool could result in the observed decline in influenza cases. One counterpoint to our expectation of widespread COVID-19 circulation since early February may be the lack of increased cases in respiratory disease hospital surveillance or in syndromic surveillance like ILINet (as the symptom profile for influenza and SARS-Cov-2 are overlapping) during this period. Additional data on COVID-19 prevalence from serological surveys will be necessary to further support these conclusions.",

We also tested whether a shift in the antigenic makeup of circulating influenza strains was explanatory. Early in the influenza season, influenza B was dominant, but since early February, influenza A H1N1 has been more prevalent. Influenza A H1N1 is expected to produce milder infections so this may explain the ILI reduction later in the season [32] . However, we found that influenza A dynamics were not significantly associated with ILI dynamics. We also considered whether there were changes in healthcare seeking that could have changed the apparent ILI dynamics, but we evaluated the number of total patients in ILINet, and found no increase in total patients within this timeframe (Appendix, Figure S2 ). Lastly, an increase in late vaccination may predict a smaller flu epidemic. However, CDC data from 2019-2020 shows that approximately 98% of the vaccine supply was distributed by January 1st 2020, and data from past seasons shows that over 90% of the cumulative flu vaccination coverage is reached by January 1st, 2020 [33, 34] .
