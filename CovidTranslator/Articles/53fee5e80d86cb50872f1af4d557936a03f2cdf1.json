Some patients have immune activation related to 'overlap syndromes' with such disorders as systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. Over half report feeling well until they had 'the worst flu of my life', after which they never felt the same, so that investigation of persistent viral infection or 'hit and run' viral episodes that result in long-term functional impairment of affected and bystander cells is relevant.",

            "text": "Not only could processing of sensory input be aberrant in CFS/FMS, resulting in dysfunctional responses, but the 'weight' given to various sensations seems to be increased, perhaps accounting for the phonophobia, photophobia and odorant sensitivity about which many patients complain ( Figure 3 ). The weight given to sensory input is called 'sensory gating', and has been studied by examining the startle reflex, which is inhibited when the startling stimulus is preceded by a weak prepulse. This phenomenon is termed prepulse inhibition (PPI), and has been studied in animals and schizophrenics. The technique has also been used to see whether men differ from women in the degree of inhibition by prepulses (Bickford et al, 1993; Swerdlow et al, 1993a,b) . Animal studies implicate the hippocampus and . Representation of a neurone processing activities or signals. Each input activity is multiplied by a number called the weight. The 'unit' adds together the weighted inputs. It then computes the output activity using an input-output function. Figure adapted from page 106, Hinton G. How neural networks learn from experience. Scientific American, September 1992, 267(3) . 9 1992 by Scientific American Inc. All rights reserved. reticular formation in PPI, and women inhibit less well than men. The research on schizophrenics does not yield any consistent results. We are studying CFS patients using this technique, and found in a pilot study that most patients have abnormal waveforms (unpublished results) . If these results hold up, they may represent a diagnostic test for CFS/FMS. The treatments discussed in this chapter may markedly improve PPI deficits. We have not been able to perform double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments because of lack of funding, but it is possible that some of the observed pharmacological effects of thse medications reproduce alterations in neurochemical and neurophysiological parameters caused by placebo administration (Peck and Coleman, 1991) . It is likely that FMS and the commonly comorbid anxiety, fatigue, migraine headaches and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (Goldenberg, 1993) have a common neurobiological mechanism, which is almost certainly supraspinal. Pain, a major symptom of FMS as well as of IBS, CFS and migraine headaches, has numerous descending inhibitory pathways from the brainstem (e.g. raphe nuclei, locus ceruleus, periaqueductal grey, reticular formation) as well as from higher centres such as the hypothalamus, thalamus, limbic system and cortical structures. The regulation of pain by 9 higher centres is poorly understood (Tasker and Dostrovsky, 1989; Coderre et al, 1993) . The muscle fatigue of CFS appears to be central (Kent-Braun et al, 1993) . Just as pain and fatigue are dysregulated, so are many other neural network functions. There is an increasing tendency to view FMS and CFS as variable presentations of the same pathophysiological process (Waylonis and Heck, 1992; Goldstein, 1993) , which appears to be neurobiological. About one third of CFS patients do not meet the tender point criteria for FMS. Numerous neurochemical abnormalities have been described in CFS/FMS. A basic finding is a low level of central corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) . This polypeptide has other central nervous system (CNS) functions besides regulating proopiomelanocortin and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion, and is involved in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system as well as the prefrontal cortex (Fisher, 1989; Takamatsu et al, 1991) . Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), a pluripotential cytokine, regulates CRH secretion through interleukin-6 (IL-6) and prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha (Rothwell, 1991) . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-1 beta levels were normal in a study of CFS patients (Lloyd et al, 1991) , as well as in an FMS cohort (I.J. Russell, personal communication), suggesting antagonism of IL-1 beta effect. CRH is also stimulated by other agents (see below). Postulating decreased IL-1 effect leaves the increased CSF substance P levels (Vcer0y et al, 1988) poorly explained, since IL-1 is known to stimulate substance P secretion (Martin et al, 1993) . Substance P, however, inhibits the release of CRH (Larsen et al, 1993) . It also unmasks connections in the dorsal horn and may be involved in the formation of new receptive fields (Hoheisel et al, 1993) .",

We consistently find rCBF measured using xenon-133 (133Xe) to decrease after exercise in this population, the opposite of what occurs in normals (Mena, 1993) .",

All clinicians seeing a large number of such patients note an increased familial incidence, with panic disorder (Hudson et al, 1992) being the familial comorbid disorder with the highest occurrence. Panic disorder is generally believed to have a predominantly limbic mechanism (Caplan et al, 1992) . However, a hereditary predisposition to develop a certain illness may range from strong to weak. Those with a strong tendency to be afflicted with CFS/FMS may have been sick since childhood. Others may require one or more triggering stimuli such as child abuse, viral infections, surgery, pronounced physical or mental overexertion, childbirth or emotional stress.",

            "text": "It is fairly well accepted that victims of child abuse are more likely to develop somatic symptoms as adults (Fry, 1993) . Since the limbic system is the primary mediator of the stress response, it is reasonable to assume that functional changes, which may be long lasting, could occur in the neurones in this network (Teicher et al, 1993) . The hypercortisolaemia of prolonged stress may damage neurons in the cornu ammonis, area 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus and alter the regulation of hippocampal corticosteroid receptors, an effect which may be ameliorated by the CNS calcium channel blocker nimodipine (Levy et al, 1993) . Changes may not only occur in transmitters and receptors, but also in the second messenger cascade, transcription factors, peptides, proteins and growth factors (Post, 1992) . Viral infections affect patients differently, perhaps depending on how viral sequences are processed and presented. Some individuals may present an epitope that others do not. Viruses may produce a latent infection that does not cause an immune response (Joly et al, 1991) , may alter secretion of only one neurotransmitter (Oldstone, 1989) , or may cause 'hit and run' infections in which long-lasting alterations of cellular function can occur after the virus has disappeared (Demitrack and Greden, 1991) . A virally induced neurotransmitter deficit may be corrected with appropriate medication (Mehta et al, 1993) . Latent herpesvirus infections are well known to exist in nerve ganglia and to appear at times of stress (Bonneau et al, 1993) . The trigeminal nerve, which can modulate limbic activity through projections to the pontine reticular formation and hypothalamus (Burstein et al, 1993) , is commonly involved in the production of herpes labialis, for example. Herpes simplex is the most common virus to infect the limbic system, usually in the anterior temporal cortex. Viruses may enter the limbic system via retrograde neuronal transport (Lavi et al, 1988) . Thus a viral infection could alter neuronal function in a genetically vulnerable person, who may already have some premorbid limbic-related disorders such as bruxism, IBS and allergic rhinitis, in such a way that the function of the neural network could be further dysregulated, and sensory gating and processing abnormalities would become manifest as deranged responses produced symptoms. The aspects of viral infection relevant to CFS/FMS are given in Table 1 . Thus far, there is no single viral candidate for precipitating CFS, and perhaps multiple agents could be implicated.",

There is a significant diminution of rCBF after a drop in the first eye, which becomes profound after the second eye is instilled. The response is not ipsilateral, as would occur from stimulation of the trigeminal neurovascular system, which causes vasodilation in only one hemisphere. I have proposed that there is a multisynaptic pathway from the mesencephalic trigeminal tract to the pontine reticular formation, and/or to the hypothalamus and thalamic reticular nuclei, and subsequently to the cortex and the limbic system, perhaps the hippocampus (Goldstein, 1993) . Sensory inputs produced by touch and pain are transmitted to the thalamus by separate pathways, but travel to the cortex in a single projection. When pain occurs, touch neurotransmission from the thalamus is inhibited by GABAergic interneurones in the thalamic reticular nuclei.

Endothelin receptors are found in neuronal, neuroendocrine and endocrine cells as well as in endothelial cells. Endothelins promote the release of vasopressin, substance P, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin and growth hormone. Rapid development of sensitization to prolonged or repetitive stimulation with endothelin is usual, probably by endocytosis of the endothelin-receptor complex (Stojilkovic and Catt, 1992) . Tolerance to naphazoline ophthalmic solution is common, as it is to other agents which may stimulate endothelin secretion (see below). Perhaps pertinent to CFS/FMS, endothelin stimulates CRH neurones (Hirai et al, 1991) . Complicating the issue somewhat, ET-1, acting at the ETB receptor, is vasodilatory, generating prostacyclin, nitric oxide, and an endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizing factor distinct from nitric oxide (Haynes et al, 1993) .",

The effect of dopamine on rCBF is somewhat similar to its action in the peripheral circulation. Low doses cause vasodilation and high doses produce vasoconstriction (Koyama et al, 1990; Grasby et al, 1993) . The dopamine-releasing properties of ET-1 have thus far been studied only in relation to its production of ischaemia, and can be attenuated by calcium channel blockers (Ooboshi et al, 1993) and hydralazine (Fuxe et al, 1992) , both of which are sometimes effective treatments for CFS/FMS. ET-1 given by intracerebroventricular injection to mice produces long-lasting, dose-dependent antinociception, which is not antagonized by naloxone (Nikolov et al, 1992) . Because of the high density of endothelin receptors in the hypothalamus and the limbic system, CSF endothelin levels were measured in patients with depression and in normal controls (Hoffman et al, 1989) . Endothelin levels in the depressed group were about half of that of the control population. Endothelins are thought to be 'paracrine factors normally involved in long-term cellular regulation, but which may be important in several pathologies, many of them stress-related' (Huggins et al, 1993) . Numerous endothelin agonists have been synthesized (Huggins et al, 1993) and an agent with appropriate receptor specificity may be a useful treatment for neurosomatic disorders.",

When I saw the profound regional cerebral hypoperfusion in CFS/FMS brain SPECTS, one of my first inclinations was to reverse it with NO. The best available marketed source of NO is glyceryl trinitrate, which exerts its vasodilatory actions by conversion into NO. Giving CFS/FMS patients very low (0.04 mg) doses of sublingual glyceryl trinitrate sometimes results in an amelioration of symptoms, especially pain, in about 2 rain. It is also effective in central pain such as deafferentation syndrome and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Patients with failed back syndrome often respond to it.

Such a mechanism could also produce lower levels of CNS serotonin, dopamine, certain prostaglandins, IL-6 and CRH. IL-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA) and IL-1 receptor antagonist protein mRNA are densely localized in the dorsal raphe nuclei that synthesize serotonin (E. De S0uza, personal communication).",

Many effects of NMDA receptor activation appear to be mediated by NO, since glutamate is a primary ligand for the NMDA receptor. Thermal hyperalgesia in animals is potentiated by NO causing an increase in cyclic GMP and thus an increase in glutamate, and NMDA receptor antagonists and NO synthase inhibitors are being developed as novel analgesics (Woolf and Thompson, 1991) . It thus appears that peripfferal thermal pain processing is modulated by NO in an opposite manner to central pain, and certainly glyceryl trinitrate has had no effect on peripheral noxious stimulation in my patients. A corollary to this hypothesis is that NO-modulated sensory gating in CFS/FMS occurs rostral to the dorsal horn. NMDA receptor antagonists given by the intracerebroventricular route have been shown to attenuate the antinociceptive effect of NMDA receptor antagonists, given intrathecally, which would have primarily a spinal site of action (Nasstrom et al, 1993) . This explanation is similar to that proposed by M. B. Yunus, i.e. that the pain of fibromyalgia is a result of central sensory dysregulation (Yunus, 1992) . Yunus conceives of a 'heterogeneous neurohormonal dysfunction' as the primary problem and describes peripheral and supraspinal structures interacting at the level of the dorsal horn to cause sensory gating abnormalities. My view is that the dorsal horn is one of many sensory 'gates' that might be dysfunctional, and that most of them are rostral to the spinal cord. This expansion of Yunus' basic concept would better explain the wide variety of symptoms and specific findings on functional imaging of the brain and neuropsychological testing.",

Ongoing morphological changes occur in dendrites to modify the synaptic communication between neurones and glia. Synapse density of adult mammalian hippocampal neurones has been found to fluctuate depending on the circulating levels of oestradiol. In the adult primate oestradiol valerate treatment resulted in a 39% decrease in the number of axosomatic synapses in the infundibular hypothalamic nucleus (Naftolin et al, 1993) , a possible example of synaptic convergence. Such variations in synapse density could account for the cognitive dysfunction associated with late luteal phase dysphoric disorder and a decrease in the efficiency of synaptic gating and sensory input processing.

These include isradipine, nifedipine, nicardipine, felodipine, nitrendipine, nisoldipine, amlodipine and nimodipine. Each of these drugs is slightly different from the others. Nimodipine is used primarily for its effects in counteracting cerebral vasospasm from subarachnoid haemorrhage, since it has fewer systemic hypotensive effects than other dihydropyridines and is more lipophilic, enabling it to cross the blood-brain barrier more easily. Nicardipine is a better cerebral vasodilator (Alborch et al, 1992) , but it lowers blood pressure too much to be prescribed in the acutely ill patient with a ruptured aneurysm. It may be, however, that the neuroprotective effects of nimodipine in subarachnoid haemorrhage are not related to vasodilation, but to some other mechanism (Tettenborn and Fierus, 1993) .",

It is also the most useful in treatment-resistant panic disorder (Gibbs, 1992) , a related limbic dysfunction. Neuronal plasticity is related to calcium-dependent pre-and postsynaptic processes such as occur with LTP in the hippocampus (Ginspen, 1993) . Nimodipine strongly enhances the firing rate of single aged hippocampus neurones recorded in vivo, while two other calcium-channel blockers, nifedipine and flunarizine, do not (Disterhoft et al, 1993) . A 30 mg nimodipine capsule usually works in about 45 min, often producing relaxation, increased energy, a decrease in tender point sensitivity, improved exercise tolerance and enhanced mental clarity. Calcium-channel blockers of other sorts have previously been reported to be useful in panic disorder (Goldstein, 1985; Klein and Uhde, 1988) and in potentiation of opioid analgesics (Pereira et al, 1993) . Nimodipine is also being investigated in treating HIV cognitive/motor complex. Calcium-channel blockers potentiate the action of lignocaine (lidocaine USP) (Taniguchi et al, 1993) and are analgesic as monotherapy when given epidurally (Dey et al, 1993) or topically in the eye (Chen et al, 1993) . Some of my patients with developmental learning disorders have had remarkable improvement with nimodipine. The drug also has antidepressant effects, both in patients and in animal models (de Jonge et al, 1993) .",

            "text": "About two-thirds of the time, nimodipine causes further vasoconstriction on post-treatment CFS/FMS 133Xe brain SPECT, sometimes to a profound degree. This paradoxical response is another demonstration that therapeutic benefit in CFS/FMS derives from release of a substance that has intrinsic vasoconstrictive properties. Nimodipine has been shown to release dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine (Azmitia et al, 1993; Fanelli et al, 1993; Rezvani et al, 1993) . Of these transmitters, only serotonin can be vasoconstrictive in the human brain at physiological concentrations. Tolerance does not develop to the vasodilatory properties of nimodipine, but it sometimes does to its effect in CFS/FMS. Nim0dipine does not cause release of any substance known to increase secretion of endothelin. Such compounds include angiotensin II, thrombin, bradykinin, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), ACTH, platelet-activating factor, cytokines, vasopressin, and various growth factors including transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) (Stojilkovic and Catt, 1992) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) (Matsumoto et al, 1990) . None of these are known to be deficient in CFS/FMS except IGF. I have prescribed vasopressin in the form of desamino-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) for numerous patients over the years with minimal results and have also combined it with fenfluramine as a secretagogue in an attempt to increase CRH secretion, with no effect. Vasopressin levels are actually elevated in CFS (G. Chrousos, personal communication). TGF beta, if anything, is elevated in CFS (Goldstein, 1990; Chao et al, 1991) , and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril, an effectiye antidepressant (Zubenko and Nixon, 1984) , have some limited utility in ameliorating CFS/FMS symptoms, probably because captopril is an endopeptidase inhibitor which can increase concentrations of certain peptides, including the enkephalins. ACE inhibitors also increase bradykinin secretion, which increases endothelin levels as well as stimulating release of NO from endothelial cells. Captopril, the only ACE inhibitor to have a sulphydryl group, is also the only marketed agent of its class with antidepressant properties.",

This drug has been reported to increase secretion of growth hormone (Arvat et al, 1993) by potentiating growth hormone-releasing hormone via a central cholinergic mechanism. Somatomedin C/IGF-1, a growth hormone related peptide, has been found to be low in patients with FMS (Bennett et al, 1992) . As noted previously, IGF may increase the central secretion of endothelin.

Thus far they seem to involve sensory gating and processing of sensory input, and are probably multifactorial in aetiology. The regions of the limbic neural network most affected, and the way in which the function of the neuronal machinery is deranged, markedly influence patient symptomatology. The rapid response to the medications described here and the concomitant profound post-treatment alteration in brain SPECT suggests, at least on a neurophysiological basis, that many neurosomatic disorders may be improved by ameliorating state-dependent deranged neural network function.",

These drugs are all relatively free of adverse reactions and do not appreciably interact with one another. Two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) should not be given conjointly. I prefer sertraline (Zoloft) because it does not inhibit hepatic cytochrome P450, and thus does not increase serum levels of other agents metabolized by the liver. Paroxetine, however, is less likely to cause agitation and gastrointestinal side-effects. SSRls do not have as effective an analgesic effect as the other agents.",
