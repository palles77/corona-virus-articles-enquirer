In addition, viral part, ides were found free in the cytoplasm or surrounded by a unit membrane. The location of viral particles closely parallels that of TGE virus. The negatively stained particles showed a typical coronavirus morphology. These coronavirus-like particles were morphologically indistinguishable from TGE virus and HEV particles in similar preparations. However, by direct IEM, they were distinct from these two eoronaviruses of swine. The size and morphology of the particles were similar to those of the recently recognized eoronaviruses reported by P~SCSAERT and DE BOUCK (15) and by CHAS~SY and CAaTUmmHT (4) in epidemic diarrhoea of pigs. As mentioned above, TGE virus was excluded as the etiological cause of diarrhoea on the original farms. The histopathology of the intestine and the ultrastruetural changes in villous epithelial cells also differed from those caused by TGE virus. In the case of TGE, the marked shortening of villi of the small intestines that HooPEa and HAELTEaMA~ (10) referred to as villous atrophy proved to be a highly significant lesion. These morphological changes affect the entirety of the villi; they are not restricted to the absorptive cells. Furthermore, simultaneously with the regressive alterations, a marked cell proliferation can be demonstrated in the crypts of Lieberkiihn presumably replacing the destroyed and sloughed epithelial cells.",
