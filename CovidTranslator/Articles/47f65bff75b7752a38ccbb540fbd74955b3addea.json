[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] This has become modern classification. 9 The infectious etiology, differential diagnosis and management for perforated appendicitis and non-perforated appendicitis are current hot topics. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Since the appendix is connected to cecum which is exposed to the environment outside of human body, appendicitis can be caused by different etiologies. Therefore, appendicitis should not be only one entity, but a group of different entities. The histological examination of sporadic patients is targeted at a certain stage of different entities of appendicitis and the histological changes of appendicitis can not be seen continuously for same entity of appendicitis. It is therefore the classic description of natural history of appendicitis and the modern classification are deduced, not evidenced.",

In 1997, we found a more severe cluster of appendicitis among students at a high school in China. 33 As this type of appendicitis had unique pathologic findings, namely, hemorrhage in the lamina propria and hyperplastic lymphoid follicles, We tentatively named this condition \"acute hemorrhagic appendicitis.\" In 2012, Fusobacteria were also found in appendices of our clustering patients. 34 Since beginning of 2005, we have been looking for new cluster/outbreak of appendicitis. We found that clusters/outbreaks occurred in many provinces of China and some of them were reported in English and some in Chinese medical journals. The aim of this study was to provide a new method to demonstrate different entities of appendicitis, causal association between microbiota and different entities of appendicitis and to improve modern understanding of sporadic patients. A second aim was to confirm common settings of outbreak/cluster of appendicitis and to provide guidance to find new clusters/outbreaks of appendicitis worldwide. A third aim is to provide the epidemiological evidences of infectious etiology of appendicitis.",

The living condition and the hygiene were good overall. See supplementary 3 Before 2000, there were clusters of infectious diseases, eg, tuberculosis, varicella, mumps, etc. From 1998, the incidence rate of appendicitis increased in Tibetan students. After 2000, the patients were admitted to the collaborating hospital. This study included 973 (474 male and 499 female) Tibetan students enrolled at this high school. Among them, there were 120 students suffered from acute appendicitis (102 females and 18 males) and 117 among them admitted to the collaborating hospital. Patients' age ranged from 12 to 17 years. The mean age was 14.3 years. Person and time distribution of the patients were showed in table 1. There was a female preponderance (female 20.4%, 102 of 499; male 3.8%, 18 of 474; chi-square=62.280, P\u22640.001). The incidence peak appeared from 2004 to 2006. In 2003, epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in China. Because isolation of visitors, disinfection and personal protection were carried out at this school for prevention of epidemic of SARS, there was only 1 patient with acute appendicitis.

Post cluster: From the end of the initial cluster until June, 2000, 20 additional outbreaks were encountered. Patients' ages: 16\uff5e20 years More female patients (6.5%) than male patients (1.9%). Many patients had a history of mutual contact before the onset of symptoms.
