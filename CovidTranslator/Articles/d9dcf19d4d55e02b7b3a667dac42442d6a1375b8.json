The experiment was repeated. Diarrhoea and shedding of oocysts were seen in all animals infected with the CPB-0 isolate. Clinical signs included depression, inappetence, vomiting (exclusively in the piglets), and death.

The difference in daily weight gain between infected and control animals was significant only for piglets co-infected with rotavirus. The acute phase response of haptoglobin and SAA was characterised by a large individual variation. In piglets, co-infected with rotavirus, the levels of serum haptoglobin were 3.5 and 4.6 times higher in the infected versus the controls 6 and 9 dpi, respectively (mean values: 2411 g/ml\u00b1S.D. 2023 and 1840 g/ml \u00b1 S.D. 1697). In the controls infected with rotavirus, peak haptoglobin concentration was seen 3 dpi (mean: 1022 g/ml \u00b1 S.D. 425).

This makes the model ideal for dose-response studies, evaluation of therapeutic agents as well as for assessment of differences in the clinical response to isolates of diverse genetic background. In conclusion, it was shown that the CPB-0 isolate was pathogenic to calves and piglets at a dose of 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 oocysts, and that the clinical signs could be replicated during separate experiments. Moreover, diarrhoea, oocyst shedding, body weight changes, histological alterations, and the acute phase response of haptoglobin and SAA were identified as useful parameters for discrimination of isolate-specific differences of pathogenicity.",

There are at least 11 Cryptosporidium species, and new species as well as genotypes are regularly described (Fayer et al., 2000 (Fayer et al., , 2001 . While current studies concerning the genetic structure of Cryptosporidium have been numerous, the number of biological studies has been relatively restricted. Consequently, there is an urgent need for biological studies so that the genetic variation may be correlated with clinically important characters of significance for the diagnosis, treatment and control of cryptosporidiosis.",

Moreover, differences between isolates of C. parvum have been shown at the molecular level by several techniques among those, analysis of microsatellites. Thus, a recent study demonstrated the existence of four different alleles in Danish Cryptosporidium isolates of human and bovine origin, in addition to the genetically distinct porcine genotype, which was found in Danish pigs (Enemark et al., 2002) . As a consequence, the present experiments were performed, the purposes being (1) to develop an animal model for pathogenicity studies of genetically diverse isolates, (2) to evaluate and identify parameters of pathogenicity including well-known parameters such as clinical signs, oocyst shedding and histopathological changes in the intestine, (3) to study the acute phase response of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u2423), haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA), and finally (4) to characterise the 'Copenhagen calf laboratory isolate' with special reference to virulence.",

The estimate was adjusted for the effect of time relapse after inoculation by adding the linear effect as well as the squared linear effect of time to the model. Because the measures were obtained repeatedly from each individual animal, a pig-level random effect was added to the model to adjust for the dependency of measures obtained from the same individual. The model was estimated using the NLMIXED procedure in SAS.

Intermittent, dry coughing was observed 3-6 dpi in several piglets including the controls. Following the onset of vomiting and diarrhoea, subnormal temperatures (<38.8 \u2022 C) were observed in five of six piglets (Fig. 3C) . A large individual variation in the clinical signs was seen between the piglets. Thus, one piglet had semi-liquid faeces for a single day succeeded by the excretion of high numbers of oocysts through several days without any clinical signs, whereas another piglet had to be euthanised 7 dpi due to dehydration and circulatory failure.

Towards the end of the experiment oocysts were excreted intermittently by three piglets. Three littermates (controls) remained free from enteric signs as well as cryptosporidia throughout the study, however mild depression (0-7 dpi), and lameness on one leg (0-8 dpi) following injury during transport were seen in one piglet in this group (Table 1, Fig. 3B ).

The experimental animals were obtained from commercial herds, artificially reared and brought up in isolation. SPF-piglets (born by normal farrowing with a naturally acquired intestinal microflora) were chosen because it is a well-known fact that a normal intestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens, thus influencing the course of clinical disease (Hudault et al., 2001) . Our model increases the risk of co-infection with other potentially pathogenic organisms, which makes the interpretation of the results more complicated. The advantage however, is that the model is less expensive than a gnotobiotic model, and allows the study of Cryptosporidium in a more natural setting of other micro-organisms.",

Other investigators have used doses of 10 6 to 10 7 C. parvum oocysts to induce clinical signs in experimentally infected piglets and calves (Tzipori et al., 1994; Fayer et al., 1998) . In a study by Vitovec and Koudela (1992) self-limiting, watery diarrhoea lasting 2 days was produced in conventionally reared piglets infected with 5\u00d710 6 oocysts, but no clinical signs were seen in conventionally reared piglets inoculated with 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 oocysts. In gnotobiotic piglets infected with 5 \u00d7 10 6 oocysts the clinical signs were more severe including death, and oocysts were still detectable in the faeces at termination of the experiment 16 dpi. In spite of the comparatively low inoculation dose used in our study, the pattern of oocyst shedding was similar to what was found by Tzipori et al. (1994) in piglets inoculated with 10 7 oocysts at 2 days of age. The clinical signs were consistent with previous descriptions of anorexia, vomiting, watery diarrhoea, dehydration and death in neonatal, experimentally infected piglets (Tzipori et al., 1981 (Tzipori et al., , 1994 Moon et al., 1982; Vitovec and Koudela, 1992) . In contrast, no signs of clinical illness were seen in either new-born or weaned miniature piglets repeatedly inoculated with 10 6 to 10 7 C. parvum oocysts (Arnault et al., 1994) . Neither were any clinical manifestations observed in experimentally infected piglets older than 15 days (Tzipori et al., 1982) , and isolation studies as well as epidemiological surveys have shown that oocyst shedding was not statistically associated with diarrhoea in naturally infected pigs from conventional farms (Sandford, 1987; Quilez et al., 1996) .",

Rotaviruses have been described as important enteric pathogens in neonates of many species including calves and piglets. Under experimental conditions in gnotobiotic and colostrum-deprived pigs rotaviruses are able to produce severe gastroenteritis and villous atrophy. They are frequently detected in pigs with diarrhoea but subclinical infections are equally common (Paul and Stevenson, 1992) . There is some evidence that combined infections with viruses, E. coli and Cryptosporidium spp. are frequent (Liebler et al., 1992) , and that the presence of other pathogenic agents seems to enhance the development of clinical cryptosporidiosis (Fayer et al., 1985; Naciri, 1989) . Han et al. (1995) confirmed this in a study in which groups of 10-day-old piglets were given either C. parvum, porcine rotavirus or both pathogens together. In accordance with our results, diarrhoea was most severe, faecal oocyst counts higher and the intestinal lesions more pronounced in piglets given both pathogens, suggesting an additive or synergistic effect between these pathogens. The current finding of elevated levels of haptoglobin and SAA in combined infections compared with mono-infected piglets, either with rotavirus or C. parvum, intimate a more severe outcome of concurrent infection with these organisms. The present results additionally suggest that the virulence of rotavirus in the absence of other pathogens can be negligible in conventional piglets even if they are infected at a very young age. Inoculation studies in which the serogroup of the virus is known and the dose of each pathogen is regulated are needed though to further elucidate the interaction between the organisms.",

Haptoglobin and SAA are major acute phase proteins in most species studied (Mackiewicz et al., 1993) , and well-known general indicators of inflammation, trauma and other pathological conditions (Kushner and Rzewnicki, 1994; Baumann and Gauldie, 1994) . Serum haptoglobin has been shown to be highly correlated with the inoculation dose as well as with strain virulence in, e.g. mice and pigs inoculated with Toxoplasma gondii (Jensen et al., 1998; Jungersen et al., 1999) , and therefore, potentially attractive as a measure of pathogenicity in hosts infected with other protozoa such as C. parvum. In the present study, increased serum levels of haptoglobin and SAA were observed during the first as well as the second experiment, i.e. irrespective of concurrent rotavirus infection. However, the responses were more dramatic in piglets infected with both pathogens as an indication of more severe enteric damage. In the infected piglets of Experiment 2, haptoglobin reached maximum concentrations up to above 5000 g/ml while SAA increased up to 280 g/ml. No SAA response was observed in the controls of Experiment 2, but a haptoglobin response with peak values 3 dpi (mean 1022 g/ml) was found to be correlated to the mild diarrhoea caused by rotavirus. In Experiment 1, serum concentrations of haptoglobin peaked around 9 dpi in infected plus controls. In the light of this observation, it is concluded that the respiratory signs seen possibly as a result of cooling influenced the acute phase response. Therefore, the acute phase response to C. parvum cannot be evaluated based on this experiment. Nevertheless, there was a correlation to the clinical signs, as manifested by the clear response in one piglet, which also showed elevated levels of SAA, indicating that a measurable SAA response could only be induced by severe enteric signs. Thus, this acute phase protein might be a valuable tool to point out the most severely affected individuals.",

Further, it was shown that this particular isolate was pathogenic to calves as well as piglets even at a relatively low dose, and that the clinical signs could be replicated during separate experiments. Moreover, diarrhoea, oocyst shedding, body weight changes, histological alterations, and the acute phase response of haptoglobin and SAA were identified as useful parameters of pathogenicity. These results demonstrate that clinical cryptosporidiosis can be induced in SPF piglets with a naturally acquired intestinal microflora, and thus should be included as a causative agent of diarrhoea in young pigs.",
