            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) have emerged as the two most important arbovirus diseases of global health significance. Similar clinical manifestations, transmission vectors, geographical distribution, and seasonal correlation often result in misdiagnosis of chikungunya infections as dengue cases and vice versa. In this study, we developed a rapid and accurate laboratory confirmative method to simultaneously detect, quantify, and differentiate DENV serotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 and CHIKV. This SYBR Green Iebased one-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay is highly sensitive and specific for CHIKV and DENV. Melting temperature analysis of PCR amplicons was used to serotype DENV and to differentiate from CHIKV. The detection limit of the assay was 20, 10, 50, 5, and 10 RNA copies/reaction for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, and CHIKV, respectively. Our assay did not cross-react with a panel of viruses that included other flaviviruses, alphaviruses, influenza viruses, human enteroviruses, and human coronaviruses. The feasibility of using this assay for clinical diagnosis was evaluated in DENV-and CHIKV-positive patient sera. Accordingly, the assay sensitivity for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, and CHIKV was 89.66%, 96.67%, 96.67%, 94.12%, and 95.74%, respectively, with 100% specificity. These findings confirmed the potential of our assay to be used as a rapid test for simultaneous detection and serotyping of DENV and CHIKV in clinical samples.

            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) are two of the arthropod-borne diseases that are affecting many countries worldwide, especially in the tropics and subtropics. 1 Belonging to the genus Alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, CHIKV has a genomic structure of 5 0 cap-nsP1-nsP2-nsP3-nsP4-(junction region)-C-E3-E2-6K-E1-Poly (A)-3 0 . 2 DENV is a flavivirus of Flaviviridae family and has a genomic structure of 5 0 UTR-C-prM (M)-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-3 0 UTR. 3 Both DENV and CHIKV infections have similar geographical distribution and seasonal correlation 4,5 because they share the same vectors for transmission: Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. 6 Clinical manifestations of DENV infections are often indistinguishable from CHIKV infections, which makes clinical diagnosis difficult. 2, 7 Although both DENV and CHIKV are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that have similar vectors, transmissibility, and clinical symptoms, DENV infections can be more severe when compared with CHIKV infections. 2, 7 DENV is traditionally classified into four serotypes: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. A primary infection with one serotype of DENV is believed to confer lifelong immunity to the same serotype. On a secondary, heterologous DENV infection, antibodies predominantly directed against the initial DENV serotype are produced rapidly. 8, 9 Although most of the produced antibodies bind to the heterologous virus serotype, they are more likely to have nonneutralizing properties against the new serotype, and these have been found to enhance infection, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement. 9e11 In addition, the dominant serotype during recent large DENV outbreaks is swapping. Therefore, accurate clinical diagnosis is important in providing health care personnel the information required for proper case management and planning preventive measures. In addition, serotyping data could contribute to warn impending epidemics. Thus, it is of great concern to develop a diagnostic kit for accurate identification of the CHIKV and DENV and at the same time to serotype DENV at the point of care.",

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, especially capture of IgM, has been considered the standard for the diagnosis of arbovirus infection during the acute phase and allows diagnosis 5 to 7 days after the onset of illness but is hampered by cross-reactions between members of the Flaviviruses and Alphaviruses. 13 Shu et al 14 developed a SYBR Green Iebased real-time RT-PCR assay for DENV serotyping, but at least four tubes of reactions are needed per sample. Chien et al 15 developed a TaqMan probeebased real-time RT-PCR assay for DENV serotyping, but the method is unable to detect CHIKV simultaneously. In addition, a few TaqMan probeebased multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays for DENV and CHIKV has been developed, but these are not capable of serotyping DENV at the same time.",

            "text": "In addition, serotyping information is important for the understanding of dengue epidemiology. For instance, serotype switch is used as an early warning of epidemics in Singapore because data have revealed that such switches are associated with epidemics. In recent studies, several DENV serotyping assays have been reported to require four tubes of tests 14 or to be unable to detect CHIKV at the same time. 15, 26 Recently, a few probe-based multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays were published for simultaneous detection of CHIKV and DENV, which required individual primer and probe sets to detect each targeted virus, but none of them can be used for DENV serotyping, 27e29 probably because of the limitation in the number of channels required for discriminating the viruses using real-time PCR instruments. For instance, Cecilia et al 29 reported a single-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection and quantification of all dengue serotypes and CHIKV. The assay was developed using primers and TaqMan probes targeting DENV-1/2/3, DENV-4, CHIKV, and b-actin. The assay revealed high sensitivity for DENV (100%) and CHIKV (95.8%) with high specificity (100%) when compared with conventional RT-PCR assay. Detection limit was set within the range of 1 to 50 PFU/mL (100 PFU/mL for DENV-2 and 3, 1000 PFU/mL for DENV-1 and CHIKV, and 3250 PFU/mL for DENV-4). The assay is used primarily for detection of all four DENV serotypes and CHIKV but lacks serotyping capability. We report a rapid and accurate laboratory confirmation method to simultaneously detect, quantify, and differentiate DENV Multiplex quantitative RT-PCR DENV-1 DENV-2 DENV-3 DENV-4 CHIK DENV-1 (S144) \u00fe \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00c0 DENV-2 (STP7) \u00c0 \u00fe \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00c0 DENV-2 (New Guinea C) \u00c0 \u00fe \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00c0 DENV-3 (Eden 130/05) \u00c0 \u00c0 \u00fe \u00c0 \u00c0 DENV-4 (S8976) SYBR Green Iebased assays are more cost-effective than probe-based ones, and only two detection channels (ROX and SYBR Green) are needed, increasing adaptability of the assay to the whole range of real-time PCR instruments. However, the primary disadvantage of the SYBR Green I dye chemistry is that it binds to any double-stranded DNA, including nonspecific PCR products and primer dimers, which may lead to false-positive results. To counter the problem, primer sets used in this study were carefully designed and examined based on heterodimer formation likelihood and thermal compatibility. In brief, DENV serotyping primers were designed based on genome alignment of multiple strains of all four serotypes of DENV. The primer-binding sites selected were well conserved across all four DENV serotypes, whereas the nucleotide sequences in between, flanked by the forward and reverse primers, were less conserved to yield different Tm of the PCR amplicons. DEst1 (the targeting PrM region of the DENV genome) was selected among 20 pairs of DENV serotyping primers because of its outstanding performance in primer verification. For CHIKV, primers were designed to preferably target nonstructural protein-coding regions because they were usually well conserved. CHK1 (the targeting nsP3 region of the CHIKV genome) was selected based on its exceptionally good compatibility with DEst1, reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity in primer verification. In addition, a temperature range, instead of a fixed value, for PCR amplicons is given for each virus so that fluctuations of the Tm from the respective PCR amplicons (ie, sample variance, strain variations) could be tolerated.",
