Published data on the natural GA sources, antiviral activity of GA and its derivatives, clinical applications of GA-based drugs, and the properties of GA-containing biologically active nutrient additives are summarized. Possible mechanisms of the antiviral activity of GA and its derivatives are examined. It is shown that chemical modification of GA is a promising way of designing new highly active antiviral drugs for the prophylaxis and treatment of HIV, hepatitis B and C, corona-virus, and herpes simplex virus infections.",

They can be divided into three main groups according to chemical composition, mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, and duration of clinical effect. They include inhibitors of viral enzymes, interferons and their inductors, and immunomodulators [2] . Thus, mainly reverse transcriptase (RT) and HIV protease inhibitors are used to treat HIV infection [3 -5] . These affect biosynthesis of viral proteins and reverse transcription in the virus replication cycle, thereby suppressing HIV multiplication. HIV RT inhibitors are the most widely used class of antiretroviral preparations in the world. About 20 preparations, 11 of which are HIV RT inhibitors, are currently approved for treatment of HIV infection [5] . This class of anti-HIV preparations is represented by three subclasses of compounds, i.e., nucleoside HIV RT inhibitors and nonnucleoside and nucleotide HIV RT inhibitors [6] . The first subclass includes zidovudine (azidothymidine), the first anti-HIV agent that began to be used in 1987, didanosine, stavudine, lamivudine, zalcitabine, abacavir, and others [5, 7] .",

It has been shown that combination therapy reduces the viral loading to an allowable level in 90% of patients; lethality, by 40%. It improves the quality of life in patients [2, 7] . Incorporation of preparations that are active at the stage of virus penetration into cells has recently become a new approach to treating HIV infection. These are a new class of antiretroviral agents, fusion inhibitors, that act directly on protein HIV gp41, a molecule located on the virus surface that changes the form of the virus in order to facilitate its penetration into the host cell [7, 11] . This group includes the preparation enfuvirtide, a synthetic polypeptide consisting of 36 amino acids [11] . The principal problem with therapy by RT inhibitors is the development of resistence to these preparations. Prolonged therapy with RT and HIV protease inhibitors generates mutant strains of the virus. Thus, HIV becomes resistent to such preparations as zidovudine, stavudine, and HIV protease inhibitors within several months [6, 7] . The resistance is due to mutations and occurs at binding sites of receptors. This leads to a loss of effectiveness of anti-HIV preparations during treatment. Therefore, compounds for which the mechanism of action is related to the initial stages of the virus replicative cycle are more attractive as inhibitors of the virus multiplication cycle. They do not directly affect coding and transmission of genetic information.",

The licorice glycoside is active even in the early stages of the viral replication cycle, preventing adsorption of the virus by the cell [84 -87] . It was proposed that the mechanism of the anti-HIV effect of I was due to blockage of virus adsorption on the cell surface (blockage of bond formation between glycoprotein GP 120 on HIV-1 and HIV-2 virus surfaces and CD 4 -receptors). This was confirmed by the inhibition by I of protein-kinase C, an enzyme responsible for binding HIV-1 and HIV-2 particles to cellular CD 4 -receptors [95] . The greater inhibiting activity of these compounds upon addition to cell culture before virus adsorption argues that the principal anti-HIV activity of triterpenes and their derivatives is due to their effect on the very early stages of the virus reproduction cycle that precede penetration of the virus into the cell [110] .",

It was shown that I inhibited HIV RT, the key enzyme of the HIV-1 life cycle that is required in the early stages of cell infection, at very high concentrations (a concentration of 200 mM suppressed RT activity by 50%) [100] . Also, the aglycon of I (II) and its derivatives inhibited RT at lower concentrations and acted as non-competing inhibitors. Compound I also inhibited effectively HIV-1 production in U937 cell culture for the chronic infection model in the early stages of the virus replication cycle [92, 139] . The capability of I and II to inhibit HIV-1 RT led to the conclusion that the activity of the triterpenoids was directed at the early stages of the HIV life cycle and was mixed in nature, i.e., prevented adsorption and interacted with virus enzymes [110] .",
