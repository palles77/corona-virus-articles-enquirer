While the basic tenants of immunotoxicity have not changed in the past 10 years, several publications have explored the application of immunotoxicological data to the risk assessment process. Therefore, the goal of this unit is still to highlight relationships between xenobiotic-induced immunosuppression and risk of clinical diseases progression. In immunotoxicology, this may require development of models to equate moderate changes in markers of immune functions to potential changes in incidence or severity of infectious diseases. For most xenobiotics, exposure levels and disease incidence data are rarely available and safe exposure levels must be estimated based on observations from experimental models or human biomarker studies. Thus, it is important to establish a scientifically sound framework that allows accurate and quantitative interpretation of experimental or biomarker data in the risk assessment process.

Immunosuppression may be inherited or acquired and the impacts on wellbeing range from mild, e.g., slightly reduced response to vaccination that does not impact resistance to disease, to severe, e.g., greatly increased susceptibility to common and opportunistic pathogens and certain cancers.

Initially, the most likely clinical consequences that may occur as a result of chronic mild-tomoderate immunosuppression are described, as well as nonimmune factors that may modify these disease outcomes. Clinical and experimental animal studies that have examined immunosuppression-disease relationships are reviewed and quantitative relationships, when available, are delineated to help address gaps in human health risk assessment. To address the potential social and economic consequences that could result from immunotoxicity, a brief description of the general impact of infectious disease is provided on these parameters. The most comprehensive data bases that address severe immunodeficiency diseases, specifically primary (genetic) immunodeficiency and AIDS, are not discussed in detail, as these represent extreme examples of immunosuppression and neither the specific clinical diseases that result nor the eventual outcomes have much in common to that which occurs in individuals with chronic mild-to-moderate immunosuppression.",

Establishing the quantitative relationship between altered immune responses and frequency or severity of disease in human populations is challenging, as humans are genetically dissimilar and heterogeneous from an environmental exposure and lifestyle standpoint (House, 2010) . The latter are affected by lifestage, sex, use of certain medications, drug/alcohol use, smoking history, stress, lifestyle, occupation, and nutritional status. In combination, these factors account for the variability reported in mean immune values for human populations. This is summarized schematically in Figure 1 , where the appearance, progression, and outcome of infectious disease is viewed as an interrelationship between the virulence of the organism, infectious dose (number of organisms required to produce illness), integrity of the host's anatomical and functional barriers, and overall immunocompetence of the individual.",

Redundancy is the ability of one or more pathways of the immune system to compensate for a defect in other pathways (Nish and Medzhitov, 2011) . The effects of redundancy can help to elucidate specific immune targets of xenobiotics or infectious agents (Nish and Medzhitov, 2011) .

Thus, infections with extracellular or facultative intracellular organisms are more frequent in individuals with impaired phagocytic mechanisms, (e.g., neutropenia), or when humoral immune deficiencies are present. Obligate intracellular pathogens, which include all viruses, cannot multiply unless they are within a host cell and are more commonly observed in individuals with defects in cellular immunity which destroys infected cells.",

The respiratory system is the most vulnerable target for common pathogens, as it is directly exposed to the external environment and has a large surface area: four times the combined total surface area of the gastrointestinal tract and skin (Gardner, 2001) . Upper-respiratory infections occur in all age groups but produce the most severe effects in the very young and elderly due to their lessened immunocompetence relative to other ages.

In healthy individuals, the immune system maintains viral latency, with cellular immunity playing a major role. When the cellular immune response is compromised, viral replication can ensue and potentially cause severe complications or death. Preceding viral activation, a vigorous immune response to viral-specific antigens occurs in response to replication. As will be discussed later, changes in virus-specific immune response or activation of latent viruses has been observed in individuals with secondary immunodeficiency disorders where mild-to-moderate immunosuppression may exist.",

In contrast to cancers of internal organs, in particular those in the lung and liver, which are often induced by chemical carcinogens, virus-induced cancers are more immunogenic and, thus, more likely influenced by immunological factors. Suppression of cell-mediated immunity has been associated with higher incidences of skin cancers, leukemias, and lymphoproliferative disorders in transplant patients, whereas Kaposi's sarcoma and EBVassociated B cell lymphomas are associated with severe immunosuppression as seen in patients with AIDS. Natural killer (NK) cells are more likely to play a role in resisting the progression and metastatic spread of tumors once they develop, rather than preventing initiation (Herberman, 2001) . Unexpectedly, studies of individuals with NK cell deficiency states, most of which are associated with single gene mutations, have helped identify a role for NK cells in defense against human infectious disease. A resounding theme of NK cell deficiencies is susceptibility to herpes viruses, suggesting that unexplained severe herpes viral infection should raise the possibility of an NK cell deficit (Orange, 2002) .",

There are also disadvantages, as ethical considerations provide little opportunity for exposure to xenobiotics. Furthermore, studies with extensive biological monitoring and functional immune tests can be expensive, and exposures as well as outcomes of interest may be difficult to study in the available time frame as study participants are not typically available for long-term exposures or extended follow-up. For the purpose of obtaining data for immunotoxicological risk assessment, clinical studies are particularly useful as they can provide data on the frequency of infections or the level of immune response to vaccines.

In addition to high costs, observational studies are challenging for many reasons, including potential confounding by host (age, sex, and lifestyle) and environmental (frequency of exposure to xenobiotics and infectious agents) factors. A secondary measure of control in observational studies is through the use of multivariable analysis techniques (e.g., regression modeling), provided there is sufficient sample size and information on potential confounders.

In some instances, body burdens of chemicals have been determined, but drawing broadly applicable conclusions from some of these studies is challenging. Subjects have often been exposed to multiple xenobiotics, including those specifically addressed by the study as well as others, and characterization of chemical exposure may rely on subject recall or rough estimates of the duration and intensity of exposure. Furthermore, in contrast to experimental animals, functional assessment may be considerably more difficult in humans as it requires antigen challenge, which involves some risk to the individual. When such studies have been undertaken, subjects have been provided commercial vaccines, such as hepatitis antigen (Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 2000; van Loveren et al., 2001; Yucesoy et al., 2001; Sleijffers et al., 2003) , influenza vaccine (Looker et al., 2014) , or common childhood vaccines (Granum et al., 2013) . The cellular and humoral immune response to vaccination is thought to be a sensitive indicator of immunosuppression (Glaser et al., 1993) and can reflect susceptibility to infectious disease (Deseda-Tous et al., 1978; van Loveren et al., 2001) . In most epidemiological studies, testing in humans has been limited to blood collection, where peripheral cell counts and differentials, immunoglobulin levels, or immunophenotyping are performed. While certainly of value, it is generally agreed these are not highly sensitive indicators of immunosuppression, making it difficult to detect low-to-moderate levels of immunosuppression in the human population (Boverhof et al., 2014) .",

A study of 343 children in the United States (Michigan) showed no general association between organochlorine levels and prevalence of infections, but there was a positive association between PCBs and DDE (the primary metabolite of DDT), or PCBs and hexachlorobenzene with otitis media (Karmaus et al., 2001) . In a study of Inuit infants in Arctic Quebec, Canada (Dewailly et al., 2000) , the relative risk of recurrent episodes (at least three per year) of otitis media was higher in breast-fed infants in the second and third highest percentile of organochlorine exposure, compared to the lowest. At three months of age, breast-fed infants with higher exposure levels had lower numbers of white blood cells and lymphocytes, and lower serum IgA levels at ages 7 and 12 months, compared to bottle-fed infants. In Dutch preschool children (Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 2000) , PCB levels in breast milk (nonortho-and planar PCBs) were also associated with increased recurrent otitis media and other symptoms of respiratory infection. In this sample, the body burden of PCBs at age 42 months was associated with higher prevalence of recurrent otitis media and chicken pox. PCB body burden was not associated with differences in lymphocyte markers outside the normal range for age-matched children, although levels in breast milk and cord blood were positively correlated with lymphocyte counts and various T-cell subsets. While these findings linking otitis media with PCB exposure are consistent across three studies, it was not possible to determine whether the changes in immune parameters mediated this association or simply represented parallel findings. A long-term Japanese birth cohort study investigating the effects of environmental exposures during pregnancy and early childhood development demonstrated that higher levels of dioxin-like PCBs in maternal blood was associated with an increased risk of otitis media at age 18 months in the children supporting previous studies (Kishi et al., 2013) .",

Although some studies have described associations between pesticide exposures, altered immune functions, and increased rates of infection, sample sizes were generally small and, in some cases, patients were self-selected based on symptoms rather than exposure. Furthermore, the frequency of infections was typically estimated by recall over several years and immune function data were scarce. Not all studies had these shortcomings. For example, a relatively large (n = 1600) and well-defined population living in and around Aberdeen, North Carolina, near a pesticide dump site (a priority Superfund site containing organochlorine pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and metals), was evaluated for immune function and frequency of viral infections. Compared to a neighboring community, residents of Aberdeen, ages 18 to 40, were found to have a higher incidence of herpes zoster (reactivated herpes infection causing shingles), but no difference in the frequency of other infectious diseases (Arndt et al., 1999) . In a substudy of 302 individuals, those living in Aberdeen had significantly higher ageadjusted levels of plasma DDE than those living in neighboring communities. Furthermore, higher levels of plasma DDE were related to lower lymphocyte responses to mitogens but higher absolute lymphocyte counts and IgA levels (Vine et al., 2001) . In a separate analysis, residents living nearer to the pesticide dump site had both a lower lymphocyte response to mitogen stimulation and a greater likelihood of having a lower percentage of CD16 + (NK) cells, <8%, the lower limit of the normal reference range (Vine et al., 2000) . The association seen with reactivated herpes infection is plausible in light of these changes, given that NK cells play an important role in the generation of cytotoxic T-cells required to help control viral infections. These studies illustrate several challenges in demonstrating the effects of chemical exposures in a population-based setting. Although an infectious outcome (zoster) was associated with residential history of chemical exposure in Aberdeen, suggesting immunosuppression related to proximity to the dump sites, the more extensive and expensive immune markers and serum indicators of exposure were only examined in a small subset of the original sample. Thus, it was not possible to further examine potential pathways leading to the association with Herpes zoster.",

Other metals (e.g., mercury and cadmium) have been shown to have immunotoxic effects, as have mixed exposures, such as those experienced by welders exposed to metal fumes and gases. As reviewed by Antonini et al. (2003) , welders may experience increased susceptibility to pulmonary infection, including pneumococcal pneumonia (Wong et al., 2010; Palmer and Cosgrove, 2012) and recurrent respiratory infections (Tuschl et al., 1997) , possibly due to decreased NK activity or cell-mediated immunity. Immunologic changes in workers occupationally exposed to metals (e.g. welders) have shown mild to moderate decreases in lymphocyte populations (CD3+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, and CD19+ B-cells) and reduced immunoglobulin levels in peripheral blood as well as increased inflammation and oxidative stress (reviewed by Ziedler-Erdely et al., 2012) . It is conceivable that such impacts on immune function may contribute to increased risk of infections in welders. Although a number of human studies have evaluated immune system endpoints in occupationally exposed cohorts, immune function and infectious outcomes generally have not been reported for the same cohort. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that vaccination of welders and other workers exposed to metal fumes may reduce the risk of pneumonia in exposed workers (Palmer and Cosgrove, 2012) .",

Like PCBs, PFASs are used industrially but have entered the environment through accidental releases, leaks, allowable discharges, and as breakdown products of PFAS-containing materials. While epidemiological data associating PFAS exposure with immunosuppression are still limited, the concordance of these limited epidemiological data with laboratory animal studies confirm that exposure to these agents can be associated with immunosuppression. Changes in immune parameters have been reported in two studies of a human population living near a facility that manufactures PFASs. Emmett et al. (2006) reported increases in absolute monocyte counts whereas Fletcher et al. (2009) reported decreases in serum IgA and IgE. Work is ongoing to determine if these changes are associated with incidence of disease or vaccine responses. A recent publication of this population indicated that elevated serum concentrations of one PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid) were associated with a reduced antibody titer rise to an influenza virus as well as an increased risk of not reaching an antibody threshold considered protective (Looker et al., 2014) . In two separate prospective studies, responses to childhood vaccines were inversely associated with serum PFASs. Maternal serum PFAS concentrations were inversely associated with levels of anti-rubella antibodies in three year old children were inversely associated with maternal serum PFAS concentrations (Granum et al., 2013) . Similar to the PCB studies linking otitis media with exposure, these results are consistent, but it was not possible to determine whether the changes in immune parameters were driven by serum PFAS concentrations or simply represented parallel findings.",

            "text": "Effect on Common Infections-It is well established that psychological factors (stressors), such as separation and divorce, caregiving for Alzheimer's patients, or bereavement, produce low-to-moderate degrees of immunosuppression and increase infectious disease incidences (Cohen, 1995; Biondi and Zannino, 1997; Yang and Glaser, 2000; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2002; Damjanovic et al., 2007) . For example, in a study that followed 100 members of 16 families for 1 year, infections were four times more likely to occur following a family-related stress event than if no stress event occurred (Meyer and Haggerty, 1962) . In a prospective cohort study, 246 individuals from 58 families were followed for the effects of family functioning and stress on the incidence of influenza infection (Clover et al., 1989) . Examinations ~2 weeks after an influenza epidemic ended showed that infection was negatively associated with both cohesion and adaptability. In a study where humans were challenged with an infectious agent, 394 healthy subjects were assessed for psychological stress and subsequently administered nasal droplets containing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or coronavirus (Cohen et al., 1991) . The rate of respiratory infections (p < 0.005) and clinical colds (p < 0.02), as determined by virus-specific antibody levels and viral isolation, increased in a dose-responsive manner with increasing degrees of psychological stress. In several follow-up studies, Cohen et al. (1999; demonstrated that psychological stress is positively correlated with the severity of the response to a dose of a respiratory pathogen (Figure 2) . Although usually conducted in small cohorts, immune testing in chronically stressed individuals has provided some insights into the relationship between mild-to-moderate immunosuppression and disease (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1986 . In chronic stress groups showing an increased rate of infections, total circulating T cell numbers can be reduced to as much as 20% below control values, while the number of circulating B cells remain unaffected. Furthermore, CD4:CD8 ratios, while usually within normally reported ranges, can be reduced as much as 40% and NK cell activity by 10% to 25% below control values. Measurement of mitogen-stimulated T lymphocyte proliferation, although not generally considered a sensitive indicator for immune function, was reduced in the stressed population by ~10% from control values. These changes are within the range of most reported normal values. In a small study of caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients, Damjanovic et al. (2007) reported that when compared to gender-matched controls, caregivers had lower T cell proliferation, increased TNF-alpha and IL-10 production, and increased telomere loss. These results suggested to Damjanovic et al. (2007) that the chronic stress of caregiving altered T cell function and accelerated immune cell aging. It is worth noting that stress early in life has been reported to have adverse effects that persist well into adulthood (e.g., Faqundes et al., 2013) , similar to greater persistence of immunosuppression following developmental exposure to immunotoxic xenobiotics (see IMMUNE SYSTEM, DISEASE, AND LIFE STAGE, below). It is important to consider that chronic stress may exacerbate or synergize with other causes of immunosuppression, including aging, thereby further increasing the risk of infection (Gouin et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "Effect on Latent Viruses-Associations between chronic stress and reactivation of latent viruses, such as CMV, HSV-1, or EBV, as measured either by clinical disease or elevations in specific antibody titers have also been observed (Kasl et al., 1979; Glaser et al., 1987 Glaser et al., , 1993 Esterling et al., 1993; Cohen, 1995; Biondi and Zannino, 1997; Yang and Glaser, 2000; Faqundes et al, 2014 ). An increase in specific antibody titers to latent viruses (i.e., seroconversion), which reflects viral activation and replication, precedes disease onset, although only ~20% of seroconverters actually develop clinical manifestations. Studies have also been conducted to examine associations between psychological stress and the immune response following hepatitis B, influenza virus, or pneumococcal vaccination, (reviewed in Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2002) . In studies of students under defined academic stress, the ability to seroconvert following first and second immunizations with hepatitis B vaccine were highly associated with tests to measure stress levels (Glaser et al., 1992) . In studies involving influenza vaccinations, Alzheimer's disease caregivers responded less favorably to vaccination, with only 12 (38%) compared to 21 controls (66%) showing a 4-fold increase in antibody titer following immunization. A four-fold increase is considered an adequate response (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1996) . As shown in Figure 3 , even more striking were the effects on pneumococcal vaccine responses in caregivers, where a significant decrease in antibody titer occurred in current caregivers compared to controls over the 6-month period following immunization (F(5.82,142.46) = 2.56; p < 0.03; Glaser et al., 2000) . In a recent study associating attachment anxiety, which is a chronic interpersonal stressor, with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reactivation, Faqundes et al. (2014) reported increased EBV antibody titers in individuals with high attachment anxiety. Although acute stressors, like chronic stressors, also are moderately immunosuppressive, large interindividual differences exist due to the variability in stress-induced sympathetic nervous system activation, and most observed changes are short-lived (reviewed in Marsland et al., 2002) .",

Immunodeficiency can persist following cell grafting due to pregrafting radiation treatment and is manifested as decreases in primary antibody responses and delayed hypersensitivity responses as well as lower CD4 + cell numbers and serum IgG2, IgG4, and IgA levels (Ochs et al., 1995) . As a result, infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality following the transplant (O'Shea and Humar, 2013; Figure 4 ). In children, T-cell population deficiencies can persist for up to six months and for as long as a year in adults; opportunistic viral, bacterial, and fungal infections account for nearly 40% of the mortalities observed in patients receiving an allograft (Adr\u00e9-Schmutz et al., 2009) . Thus, prospective studies provide an excellent model to help identify quantitative relationships between immune function and disease as the immune system undergoes recovery. Excluding upper-respiratory infections, which are seldom monitored in allogeneic bone marrow recipients, the incidence of infections exceeds 80% during the first 2 years post-engraftment, with 50% of the patients having three or more infections. Opportunistic infections predominate, with fungal infections being the most common followed by those of bacterial and viral origins (Ochs et al., 1995; Atkinson, 2000) . Although infections that occur in the first month following transplant are most likely due to deficiencies in granulocytes, later infections appear to be due to deficiencies in CD4 + T cells and B cells.",

A smaller but more detailed study by Storek et al. (1997) , evaluating 29 patients for 180 days preceding the 1-year post-transplant exam, showed a highly significant inverse correlation (P = 0.005 in univariate analysis) between CD4 + T cell counts and total infection score (i.e., frequency and severity) but not with CD8 + T cell numbers, B cell numbers, serum immunoglobulin levels, or delayed hypersensitivity responses. The significant association between disease and decreased CD4 + T cell counts was primarily dependent upon activated cells, rather than memory T cell subpopulations. In comparing the efficacy of allogeneic marrow transplantation to blood stem cell transplantation, Storek et al. (2000) demonstrated that a 1.7-fold lower rate of infections in blood stem cell transplants corresponded to about a 4-fold higher CD45RA high (memory) CD4 + T cells and about 2-fold higher count for CD45RA low (naive) CD4 + T cells. In studies conducted by Small et al. (1999) , which monitored immune cell recovery following bone marrow cell transplantation, the incidence of infections also correlated with CD4 + cell counts. Only opportunistic infections were monitored, however, and they were almost exclusively present in patients considered severely immunosuppressed, with CD4 + T cell counts of <200 cells/mm 3 . The relationship between CD4 + cell numbers and respiratory virus infections was examined over a 3-to 6-month period following transplantation in a small group of T-cell depleted (using anti-CD52 antibody treatment), stem cell recipients (Chakrabarti et al., 2001) . The relationship between CD4 + T cell numbers and the incidence of respiratory virus infection was relatively linear. The size of the population was small, however, and CD4 + T cells in the experimental group did not progress above 180 cells/mm 3 , compared to 700 to 1100 cells/mm 3 found in the control group. In a small study of 12 pediatric patients receiving HSCT, norovirus clearance from the patients trended with T cell recovery as measured in peripheral blood. Although the trend was not statistically significant, it was observed that patients who took longer to recover T cells took longer to clear the virus (Saif et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Studies in organ transplant patients, particularly renal and more recently liver, have also provided insights into the long-term consequences of moderate immunosuppression. While immunosuppressive therapies have greatly improved over the past 40 years, transplant patients are still predisposed to high rates of malignancies and infections. Although infection rates range between 65% and 70% during the first 6 months post-transplantation, with CMV representing 18% to 67% of the reported infections (Sia and Paya, 1998) , the month first following transplantation is characterized by the occurrence of infections (Kawecki et al., 2014) . With the advent of long-term monitoring, an increased incidence in cancer has also been noted in this population. For example, the risk of developing skin tumors following renal transplantation is 10% after 10 years and 40% after 20 years, while the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma is 250-fold higher and for basal cell carcinoma 10-fold higher than the general population (Hartevelt et al., 1990) . The initial immunosuppressive therapy for renal transplant consists generally of a combination cyclosporin (CsA), azathioprine, and steroid cocktail. Therapies are subsequently reduced, but adjusted based upon the time following transplant, evidence of acute rejection, evidence of toxicity (usually serum creatinine levels), and white blood cell count, the latter of which is maintained above 4000 cells/mm 3 . Jamil et al. (1999) , examining 478 renal transplant patients, showed that the risk of lymphomas and infections during the first 6 months post-transplantation increased proportionally with the level of immunosuppressive therapy ranging from 1.5-to 3-fold. Urinary tract infections, which are associated with the transplant, were the most common type of infection in all groups, while severe bacterial infections (pneumonia and septicemia) and systemic/invasive fungal infections were almost exclusively associated with those on the most intensive immunosuppressive therapy. A high incidence of CMV antibodies occurred in all three groups with 9%, 29%, and 53% seroconverting, based upon the level of immunosuppressive therapy. In contrast to infectious diseases, there were fewer cases of squamous and basal cell carcinomas in the most aggressively treated group compared to the other groups, probably due to the anti-proliferative effects of some of the therapeutics. Wieneke et al. (1996) , when also examining renal transplant patients, demonstrated that reduced IgG1 subclass levels and CD4 T cell counts were the best predictors for infections (relative risk increased from 9% in patients with normal values to 38% with lower values). Clark et al. (1993) , following a small cohort of 27 patients, noted that by maintaining the level of CD3 + lymphocytes to at least 500 cells/mm 3 a reduction in the number of serious viral infections occurred (p < 0.04). Overall, organ transplantation and anti-rejection therapy can lead to significant immunosuppression and susceptibility to bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections depending on patient characteristics and environment. Successful control and treatment of resulting infections requires strategic diagnostic and management approaches as the signs and symptoms of infection can often be blunted due to the immunosuppressed condition of the patient, complicating decision making for prophylactic and therapeutic antimicrobial treatment (reviewed for orthotipic liver transplantation by Pedersen and Seetharam, 2014) .",

Neonates are particularly susceptible to infectious agents that require adult-like production of antibodies and complement to mediate phagocytosis and bacteria killing.

Immature cells are incapable of making cytokines that are critical to mounting effective immune responses and generating long-lived memory cells. Phenotypic analyses of cord, neonatal, and adult peripheral blood has also shown differences in T cell subpopulations (Table 1) , as well as differences in the balance of Th1 and Th2 cytokine production. At birth, the response is skewed in favor of Th2 cell responses (Upham et al., 2002) , decreasing the efficiency of host-protective responses, particularly to intracellular bacteria, while increasing the risk of developing allergic asthma. Similar age-related defects in immune function may also be a predisposing factor in repeated inner ear infections in young children. Faden (2001) noted that 5% to 10% of children experience four or more inner ear infections within the first year of life, particularly with H. influenzae. IgG antibody responses to conserved bacterial capsular proteins did not increase after 2 years of age in the infection-prone group, and T cell responses to the same antigen were also reduced, suggesting that repeated infections may be caused by subtle immunologic abnormalities in susceptible children.",

Increased rates and severity of infections that occur in the elderly result from immunosenescence as well as other physiological changes associated with the aging process.",

Physical effects include inefficient bladder function, decreased clearance of lung secretions, and reduced gastric acidity (Gavazzi and Krause, 2002) , culminating in reduced barrier or clearance functions that normally reduce bacterial load in these organs. Various degrees of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are also more common in the elderly and can contribute to decreased resistance (Lesourd, 1997) .

In the field of immunotoxicology, a set of tests, usually referred to as host resistance assays, has evolved in which groups of experimental animals are challenged with either an infectious agent or transplantable tumor at a challenge level sufficient to produce either a low incidence or minimal infectivity in the control group ( Table 3) . The endpoints in these tests have evolved from relatively nonspecific (e.g., animal morbidity and mortality) to continuous measures, such as tumor numbers, viral titers, or bacterial cell counts and the sensitivity of these models has increased. Currently, host resistance assays provide the only reliable method of evaluating the influence of xenobiotics on the functional integrity of the immune system and its ability to eliminate pathogens or tumor cells (Burleson and Burleson, 2010) . Host resistance assays are therefore most useful in validating results of single-parameter studies and extrapolation of animal results to host susceptibility in the human population (Burleson and Burleson, 2010) .",

While it is rare for a single component of the immune system to be solely responsible for resistance to a specific infectious agent or tumor type, certain immune measures show significant correlations with the outcomes of individual host resistance assays. For example, reduction in NK cell activity has been correlated with increased susceptibility to challenge with PYB6 sarcoma cells, B16F10 melanoma cells, and murine CMV (Luster et al., 1988; Selgrade et al., 1992) . Suppression of cell-mediated immunity, complement deficiency, and depressed macrophage and neutrophil function has been associated with decreased resistance to Listeria monocytogenes (Petit, 1980; Luster et al., 1988; Bradley, 1995b; Burleson and Burleson, 2008; Burleson and Burleson 2010) . Clearance of parasitic infections, such as Plasmodium yoelii and Trichinella spiralis, have both a cellular and humoral component and decreased resistance has been shown following depression of both arms of the immune system van Loveren et al., 1995) . While the predictive values of individual immune tests for host resistance have been shown to range from relatively good (plaque forming cell assay, 73%; NK cell activity, 73%; delayed type hypersensitivity response, 82%) to poor (lymphoproliferative response to LPS <50%), combinations of several immune tests allow for very high concordance (Luster et al., 1993) , indicating that only two or three specific tests are required to screen adequately for immunotoxicity.",

This can be achieved via targeted gene disruption resulting in animals deficient in specific cell populations or soluble mediators that contribute to host defense (e.g., CD4 T cell knockouts), treatment of normal animals with selective toxic agents (e.g., the use of gadolinium chloride to block macrophage function), or administration of neutralizing antibodies against critical cell-specific surface receptors. A study by Wilson et al. (2001) was specifically designed to determine the magnitude of NK cell suppression that would translate into altered resistance in three disease models. The studies were conducted by NK cell depletion with an antibody to the cell surface molecule, Asialo GM1, using a treatment regimen that did not alter other standard immune function tests used in the assessment of immunotoxicity in rodents. These authors demonstrated that at low levels of tumor challenge, an approximate reduction of 50% or more in NK cell activity, now thought to be involved primarily in metastatic processes, was required before significant effects on resistance to NK-sensitive tumors could be observed. These studies also demonstrated that the level of suppression needed to alter host resistance was related to the challenge level of the tumor. Conversely, a study that used monoclonal antibodies to effectively deplete CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes found little evidence of altered resistance to challenge with PYB6 sarcoma cells, a model which was thought to be dependent on cell-mediated immunity (Weaver et al., 2002) . It is important that such studies assess functional endpoints as well as cell populations as subpopulations can shift. For example, a study by Steele et al. (2002) demonstrated that although CD8 + T lymphocytes infiltrate the lungs of CD4 + -depleted mice inoculated with Pseudomonas carinii, infection still progressed.",

In studies designed to specifically address these limitations, Keil et al. (2001) demonstrated that monitoring several immunological parameters concurrently provides information that might not be evident from studies using single tests. Using the prototypical immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone, these authors demonstrated that contrary to what would be expected based on the compound's suppressive effects on cytokine production, T cell function, and NK cell activity, relatively high levels of dexamethasone were needed to decrease resistance to Listeria monocytogenes. At doses that suppressed many immune parameters, an increase in neutrophil numbers, and nitrite production by peritoneal macrophages was observed. It was suggested that at lower doses of dexamethasone, the significant increase in the concentration of neutrophils in the blood, in conjunction with increased production of nitric oxide, compensated for the decrements in other immune parameters so that overall resistance to the pathogen was not compromised (Keil et al., 2001) . Heryzk et al. (1997) have developed a testing paradigm that evaluates immune function within the context of resistance to a specific infection. Following infection with Candida albicans, a four-parameter model is used that includes survival, spleen colony forming units (CFU), muscle CFU, and antibody titers, and which the authors suggest allows an inclusive evaluation of both nonspecific, cell-, and humoral-mediated immune responses. This approach has proved successful in identifying both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory compounds and has the advantage of being able to evaluate multiple immune endpoints in an intact animal and directly relate them to a clinical endpoint. The utility of the method as a screening tool has yet to be evaluated using large numbers of test articles or environmental chemicals, and the procedure is not widely used outside of the pharmaceutical industry, but increasingly, these types of assays are being used to generate reference doses for human safety (Luebke, 2010) .",

Using groups of mice that had received increasing doses of an immunosuppressive agent, Luster et al.

It was observed that even immunologically normal animals, provided a sufficient number of tumor cells, develop a high frequency of tumors and the number of tumor cells required to produce tumors decreased proportionally to the degree of immunosuppression. This was interpreted to indicate that immune function-disease response relationships tended to be linear in nature, rather than threshold. Although it is not possible to confirm these relationships in humans, it was suggested that similar response relationships would also be applicable to humans, albeit with different slopes, provided other modifiers were not present.

This decision process should take into account the social and economic impact of the potential health effects that would ensue. In order to begin establishing a framework for incorporating immunotoxicology data in the risk assessment/ management process, it is necessary to identify the social and economic impact of infectious diseases in the general population. While precise information is not readily available, several sources indicate these to be significant and that even small changes in infectious disease frequency has a major impact. The impacts associated with mortality, and to a lesser extent morbidity, from common pathogens such as influenza and pneumonia, have been determined and can serve as a basis in the risk management process. Deaths have the most costly impact on society. In 2006, the age-adjusted death rate for influenza and pneumonia was 0.3 and 17.5 per 100,000, respectively (ALA, 2010a). Together these infections were ranked as the ninth leading cause of death in the U.S. for all ages in 2010 as deaths due to these diseases decreased by 6.7% from 2009 to 2010 (Heron, 2013) . In 2010, influenza and pneumonia were ranked as the 46 th and 47 th causes, respectively, for infant death in the United States (Heron, 2013) . Other conditions secondarily related to these illnesses, such as disorders related to low birth weights, respiratory distress, or infections, accounted for higher infant deaths (Mathews and MacDorman, 2013) . For the \u226565 years age group, chronic lower respiratory disease and influenza-pneumonia were the third and seventh ranked leading causes of death in 2004, respectively (Heron, 2013) .",

It should be noted, however, that most estimates of this burden do not account for reduced functional abilities, losses from pain and suffering, or the cost to the individual, family member, or co-worker from psychological or emotional stress. There are many other fundamentally unobservable quantities, such as the value of output that is lost as a result of an employee having an infectious disease episode.

Thus, it is important that a scientifically sound framework be established that allows for the accurate and quantitative interpretation of experimental or biomarker data in the risk assessment process. For immunotoxicology data, this may require, for example, development of models to equate changes in leukocyte counts, CD4 + cell numbers and/or immunoglobulin levels, which can be readily performed in humans, to changes in the background incidence or severity of infectious diseases. Although experimental animal models provide an opportunity to perform more informative immune tests and establish reliable exposure estimates, extrapolating these findings across species also introduces considerable uncertainty. While this review does not provide a specific framework to perform these extrapolations, the authors have attempted to provide background information on qualitative and quantitative relationships between immune parameters and disease that would be integral to such an effort.

There are a number of studies, however, that indicate that these populations are at an increased risk to infection with common pathogens and latent viruses, particularly those from the Herpes family, but not to opportunistic infections. There are insufficient clinical data to determine whether the relationship between a decrease in immune response and an increase in infectious disease follows a linear or threshold relationship in humans. Studies in experimental animal models, however, support a linear relationship when multiple immune system parameters are affected. However, threshold relationships occur when single immune parameters (e.g., NK cell activity) are targeted. These differences may be associated with redundancy in the immune system.",
