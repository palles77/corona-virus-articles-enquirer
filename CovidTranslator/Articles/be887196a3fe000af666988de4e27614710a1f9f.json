This disease is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the family Coronaviridae (order Nidovirales) and genus Coronavirus (Cavanagh, 1997; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . IBV is an enveloped virus containing an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The virion includes four major structural proteins: the surface spike glycoprotein (S) consisting of two subunits S1 and S2, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, the phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein and the envelope (E) protein. N protein of IBV is highly conserved, highly immunogenic. It carries epitopes inducing cross-reactive antibodies and is the most abundant virus-derived protein produced throughout infection (Seah et al., 2000) . N protein may also induce cross-protective immunity (Boots et al., 1992; Seo et al., 1997; Yu et al., 2001) .",

In contrast, the use of recombinant full-length N protein or fragments of IBV N protein cloned and expressed into Escherichia coli or yeast as ELISA antigens for IBV-specific antibody makes testing serum samples a much cheaper and more convenient process (Chen et al., 2003; Gibertoni et al., 2005; Ndifuna et al., 1998) .",

Recombinant protein specificity was tested using Western blot with chicken antisera (Fig. 2c) . Bacterial whole-cell lysates and purified recombinant proteins were applied to 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and separated by electrophoresis at constant voltage 200 V. The gels were stained with Coomassie blue R-250 to detect proteins. The protein band of approximately 20 kDa was clearly visualized following the induction of fusion protein from pQEN2IBV with IPTG. At the same time, partial SDS-PAGE proteolysis was shown to proceed in the course of expression of the fusion protein from pQEN4IBV; two protein bands of approximately 35 and 30 kDa were seen ( Fig. 2a and  b) . However, the proteolytic products did not have any effect on the specificity or sensitivity of an indirect ELISA based on the recombinant protein as antigen (rNpIBV-ELISA) as seen below. For Western blots, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes 0.45 m pore size (Millipore Corp., USA) at 15 V and 200 mA for 1.5 h. The membranes were then treated with blocking buffer including 1% BSA before being incubated with chicken serum samples diluted 1:50 in TBST buffer (pH 7.4), containing 0.02 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antichicken immunoglobulin G (Synbiotics Corp., USA), washed three times with TBST each time, and finally 4-chloro-1-naphtol (Sigma Chemical Company, USA) was added to visualize protein bands.",

Washing of wells in TBST four times ended each stage.

The resulting corrected OD value for a test sample was divided by the mean OD value of the positive control from which the mean negative OD value was subtracted, and the results were expressed as the S/P ratio. The regression line to correlate the results of single and serial two-fold dilution methods was plotted with the aid of the computer program \"Statistica, correlation matrices\" (Stat. Soft.

As a result the sensitivity and specificity of the developed rNpIBV-ELISA was found to be not inferior (93.81% and 87.36%, respectively) to those of the routine IBV-ELISA (92.86% and 88.97%, respectively).
