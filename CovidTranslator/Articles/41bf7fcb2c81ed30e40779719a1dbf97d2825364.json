In China, although containment measures have significantly reduced new cases of COVID-19, in other countries, this reduction has not been similar. In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected and requiring intensive care by the respiratory complications associated with this infection. 1 The data collected so far on the number of infected people and the evolution of the epidemic are imprecise. Even though to date in Colombia (March 19, 2020) there are no deaths yet, nor patients in intensive care by COVID-19, the diagnoses of infection by SARS-CoV-2 have increased ( Figure 1 ). In this country, since the first case was reported (March 6, 2020), the number of infected patients follows an exponential trend, like other countries in the region, except Ecuador, with a lower incidence. If this trend continues, in a week (until March 26, 2020) or two (April 2, 2020), there will be 2,581 and 40,535 infected patients, respectively, as shown in Figure 2 . 1, 2 According with the Knowledge of this infection so far, the high-risk age groups are among the people over 60 years of age, primarily due to the burden of disease and the complications that this infection generates in them. Regarding to the current COVID-19 data available from Colombia, the proportion of patients in that age group is 15%, and of them, 4.7% needing hospitalizing, proportion which is lower than in other age groups. Additionally, as of March 19, most cases are imported (64%). 3 in Argentina after the 12th day of the first case was diagnosed, and in Panama was the first death 4 was reported after the sixth day. This situation differs from European countries, where COVID-19 associated deaths started until after the 23rd of the first diagnosis (France). Additionally, the reports curve of some European countries has a slower start compared to Latin American countries. This situation may be due to a higher degree of alertness in this region, motivated by the experiences of European and Asian countries, leading to earlier diagnostic tests (early detection).",

By March 18, 2020, Italy had already carried out 148,657 tests (31,506 -21.2% -positive), South Korea: 286,716 (8,320 -2.9% -positive), and Colombia: 2,571 tests (93 -3.6% -positive). Although the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed should be like the number of people tested, the values may differ because some people need a duplicate of the test. The reason for this is that there are \"false negative\" results. 4 However, the ability of a health system to perform these tests greatly influences the case fatality rate, as the denominator determines its value. Therefore, conducting random tests in the people infected with symptoms or disease decrease in the case fatality rate. In China, where they have done a random SARS-CoV-2 screening, the severity of the infection has shown that: 80% of the cases present mild symptoms, 15% severe, and 5% critical. For its part, in Spain, the behavior is more worrying (60% mild, 30% will require hospitalization, and 10% intensive care). 5 For Colombia, assuming a case fatality rate among people infected with SARS-CoV-2 of 0.6% (average data from the information reported for Latin American countries for March 18) (Table 1) , the number of deaths, in one or two weeks, could be 16 and 243, respectively. These estimates differ markedly from those documented in countries such as Spain and Italy, in which COVID-19 5 case fatality rates exceed 8% (case of Italy) and from the percentage of patients who have required intensive care, which has ranged from 9% to 11% of patients in Mediterranean European countries. Differences could be explained due to: a) the percentage of the population at risk (individuals older than 60 years); b) a higher epidemiological exposure to viral respiratory infections associated with more frequent exposure to them, due to geographic and climatic conditions; c) less spread of the virus by location in the tropical zone; and d) earlier preventive measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

On the other hand, the Nordic countries, where the winter season is more extensive (up to 8 months of rain and snow), and the mortality rates are lower: Denmark (0.4%), Iceland (0.3), Norway (0.3%), Sweden (0.7%), and Finland (no deaths). In Colombia, according to the National Institute of Health, consultations and hospitalizations for acute respiratory infections have at least two peaks during the year: the first between March to June, with May and June being the months with the highest number of cases; and the second between September and December. These peaks are associated with the rainy seasons that characterize those periods. From an immunological perspective, the Latin-American environmental condition characterized by a higher frequency of rains (like in Colombia and other tropical countries without the classic seasons), associated with a higher frequency of viral respiratory infections, caused by different types of viruses, could be related with a persistent exposition and training of the innate and adaptive immune responses, which allows an efficient 8 response to respiratory viral infections, with better clinical evolution and, therefore, lower complications and mortality. 7-10 Lower spread of virus in tropical countries.A study by Mohammad M.Sajadi et al.,  showed that the distribution of viral respiratory infection outbreaks depends on latitude, temperature, and humidity. As temperature and humidity are known factors that influence survival of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza viruses, it is plausible to consider that in tropical countries, like Colombia, the SARS-CoV-2 survival and spread could be lower.11",

Additionally, from March 21 Colombia will be restricting the entry of foreigners, closing bars and clubs, and establishing quarantine for several days in the most populated cities as Medellin and Bogota. Neil M Ferguson et al., conclude that the closure of schools and universities will have a positive impact on containing the COVID-19 epidemic, under the assumption that children transmit viruses as much as adults do. Additionally, that strategy is more effective in supporting the suppression of epidemics when combined with the social distancing of the entire population; the effect of schoolclosure is further to amplify the breakdown of social contacts between households, and thus suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the closure of colleges and universities may be insufficient to mitigate an epidemic in isolation.12 9Colombia is one of the countries that have reported the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in fewer days, compared to other countries in the region and Europe. Therefore, the predictions for COVID-19 in Colombia may be affected by the early and strong measures taken, and it is necessary to make a continuous analysis of the expansion and evolution SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in this country, to evaluate de results of them. The WHO, with all the actions and data received at the global level, has begun to establish the strategies that must be structured to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, such as: a) prepare and be ready, b) detect, protect and treat, c) reduce and suppress transmission, and d) learn, innovate, improve and Improve.Based on these analyses and predictions, for now, Colombia could be in a better position regarding other countries for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 evolution, supported in early actions aimed to suppress virus transmission and the lower percentage of high-risk population for COVID-19 (older adults). The expansion, complications and mortality are highly variable, even in neighboring countries; therefore, the data cannot be extrapolated, either to the worst-case like Italy or the best case like Finland",
