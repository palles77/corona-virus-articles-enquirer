We report an auto-induction methodology that provides soluble-cruzain at high yields (> 30 mg per liter in minimal media). These increased yields provide sufficient quantities of active enzyme for use in NMR-based ligand mapping. Using CD and NMR spectroscopy, we also examined the solution-state structural dynamics of the enzyme in complex with a covalently bound vinyl sulfone inhibitor (K777). We report the backbone amide and side chain carbon chemical shift assignments of cruzain in complex with K777. These resonance assignments were used to identify and map residues located in the substrate binding pocket, including the catalytic Cys25 and His162. Selective 15 N-Cys, 15 N-His, and 13 C-Met labeling was performed to quickly assess cruzain-ligand interactions for a set of eight low molecular weight compounds exhibiting micromolar binding or inhibition. Chemical shift perturbation mapping verifies that six of the eight compounds bind to cruzain at the active site. Three different binding modes were delineated for the compounds, namely covalent, non-covalent, and non-interacting. These results provide examples of how NMR spectroscopy can be used to screen compounds for fast evaluation of enzyme-inhibitor interactions in order to facilitate lead compound identification and subsequent structural studies.",

Both drugs are generally prescribed during the early acute stages of the disease, and are less effective for treatment of the chronic condition. 5 A promising target for potential therapeutics against Chagas' disease is the major cysteine protease expressed by T. cruzi, cruzain. Cruzain is a member of the papain superfamily of cysteine proteases, and is most sequentially and structurally homologous to cathepsin L. In the case of Chagas' disease, cruzain is present in all life stages of the trypanosome and is implicated in cellular entry and digestion of immunoglobins. 1 The active site of cruzain contains two catalytic residues (Cys25 and His162), with possibly a third (Asn182) residue contributing to proteolysis (sequential residue numbering, 6 instead of residue numbering matching papain, 7 is used for cruzain throughout this report). A fourth residue (Gln19) serves to stabilize the oxyanion. 8 Similar to many other cysteine protease family members, cruzain is initially expressed as an inactive zymogen, which undergoes a pH, temperature, and concentration dependent self-activation, transforming into the mature, catalytically active protease. 8, 9 One lead compound that targets the mature form of cruzain and is currently in pre-clinical trials is the vinyl sulfone, K777 (Table 1 , previously designated K11777). 10 K777 inhibits cruzain by irreversibly binding to the thiol group of the catalytic Cys25. K777 is reported to cure T. cruzi-infected mice, and has shown efficacy against multiple strains of nifurtimoxand benznidazole-resistant T. cruzi, validating cruzain as a therapeutic target for Chagas' disease. 11 However, the limited potency of K777 has generated interest in identifying new chemical scaffolds that are more effective and are non-covalent competitive inhibitors of the enzyme.",

However, due to concentrationdependent self-proteolysis, no apo structures of active cruzain are currently available. Although high-throughput screening efforts have identified potential lead compounds, not all cruzain-inhibitor complexes yielded well-behaved crystals. 12, 13 In addition, the previous expression protocol 14, 15 involved production of cruzain via inclusion bodies and the subsequent unfolding and refolding of the protease, severely limiting overall yields. With these factors in mind, we: (i) developed an expression and purification protocol that provided sufficient quantities of cruzain for NMR studies; (ii) used NMR-based methods to quickly verify and map binding modes of newly discovered inhibitors, especially those for which there is no available crystallographic data; and (iii) initiated solution-state biophysical studies to gain further insights into apo and inhibited cruzain structure-function relationships. Importantly, cruzain serves as a model for the cysteine cathepsin proteases, a large family of important enzymes.",

For uniform 13 C/ 15 N/ 2 H-labeling, a modified version of auto-induction media recipe C-750501 was used. 16 Here, 1 L uniformly 13 C/ 15 N/ 2 H-labeled rich media (E. coli-OD2 CDN, Silantes GmbH) was diluted with 1 L D 2 O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and split into 2 \u00d7 1 L aliquots. All auto-induction minimal media solutions contained carbenicillin (100 \u0394g/mL) and gentamycin (20 \u0394g/mL) as antibiotics. Further specific details regarding the modifications to the standard auto-induction recipes are reported in the Supporting Information. After shaking at 37 \u00b0C for approximately 5 hrs (until OD 600 > 0.5), the temperature was reduced to 20 \u00b0C, and the culture was allowed to shake for an additional 72 hrs. The cultures were then centrifuged, and the cell pellets were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until ready for lysis. Pre-conditioning of LB starter cultures into small volumes (50 mL) of auto-induction minimal media overnight was tried and demonstrated to be ineffective, and is therefore not recommended.",

Overall, the CD signatures acquired in the absence of denaturant at pH 5 exhibit significantly greater helical content than at pH 7 or 10 (Supplemental Fig. S3 ). The CD spectrum of procruzain at pH 5 was not acquired due to significant protein aggregation. In acidic (pH 5) and neutral conditions (pH 7) the CD signatures of inhibited cruzain remain relatively stable under increasing denaturant concentrations, with the \u03b8 222 band only losing half of its signal at 8 M GdnHCl. These results explain the lack of 2 H to 1 H back exchange observed for the uniformly labeled 13 C/ 15 N/ 2 H cruzain-K777 NMR sample described above, as low denaturant concentrations are normally used to partially unfold deuterated proteins. 22 Conversely, at pH 10, the cruzain-K777 complex becomes structurally labile at greater than 5 M GdnHCl concentrations. The apo-form of procruzain at pH 10 displayed less structural stability at low GdnHCl concentrations relative to the cruzain-K777 complex under similar conditions. In this case, the \u03b8 222 bands of the apo procruzain CD spectra were more negative than that of the cruzain-K777 complex at 0 M GdnHCl, indicating greater helical content. However, by 2 M GdnHCl, the \u03b8 222 band of the procruzain CD curve has lost more than half of its intensity.",

This labeling scheme was chosen since the two catalytic residues are Cys25 and His162. In addition, there are relatively few cysteine (eight), histidine (four) and methionine (four) residues within the cruzain sequence, which are all well-dispersed within the cruzain structure ( Figure 3 ) and in their respective HSQC spectra (Supplemental Fig. S2 ). Six of the eight cysteine residues are sequestered in disulfide bonds (Cys22-Cys63, Cys56-Cys101, and Cys155-Cys203). Of the free cysteine residues, one (Cys36) is buried in the central helical core, while the catalytic Cys25 is surface exposed. In the case of the cruzain-K777 crystal structure, 6 only the Cys22-Cys63 pair is located within 8 \u00c5 of the catalytic Cys25. Three of the four histidine residues (His43, His106, and His115) are located on the distal side of the molecule with respect to the catalytic His162. Although all the methionine residues are positioned greater than 8 \u00c5 from the active site Cys25, Met68 and Met145 are present and surface-exposed in the substrate binding pocket, while Met152 is located in a proximal loop. Importantly, Met68 forms a portion of the S2 pocket of cruzain. This binding pocket subsite, which interacts with the P2 position (two residues N-terminal to the scissile bond) of the peptide substrate, is known to be a determinant of cysteine cathepsin enzyme specificity. 23 The loop containing Met145 and Met152 is separated from the catalytic His162 by a cluster of tryptophan residues (Trp144, Trp184 and Trp188). Therefore, any perturbations in the conformation of His162 upon inhibitor binding may also propagate through the tryptophan cluster towards the two methionine residues.",

Since none of the HSQC resonance peaks concurrently broadened as inhibitor concentration increased, compound 2, not cruzain, is likely the precipitating/aggregating species in solution. Major differences in the overall perturbation patterns between the two data sets, especially noticeable for the methionines, may be attributed to the different chemical moieties present in K777 and compound 2, as well as their relative positioning on the enzyme. For example, in the crystal structure of the cruzain-compound 2 complex (3I06.pdb) 24 the inhibitor is in contact with Met68, but is positioned greater than 10 \u00c5 from Met145. Conversely, in the cruzain-K777 complex, both methionine methyl groups are in contact with the inhibitor.

Additionally, in the case of the titration with compound 4, the His162 amide resonance exhibited extensive peak broadening at low inhibitor concentrations while the intensities of the other three histidine peaks remained relatively unchanged. This broadening of a specific amino-acid resonance peak is indicative of an \"intermediate\" NMR time-scale conformational exchange, rather than protein aggregation.

In this case, compound 3 was added to the cruzain NMR samples to test the hypothesis that the nitrile group of compound 2 was necessary for covalent binding to Cys25. Similarly to compounds 2 and 8, titration of compound 3 resulted in precipitate formation in solution. In this case, however, negligible effects on resonance shift perturbations or peak broadening were observed in the 15 N-Cys and 15 N-His HSQC spectra (Supplemental Fig. S5-S6) . As with compound 8, minimal perturbations are observed for the Met145 peak (Supplemental Fig. S7 ). Direct comparison of the overall and average reporter group chemical shift perturbations between compounds 2 and 3 ( Figure 5 ) indicate that the nitrile derivative interacts more strongly to cruzain than the chlorinated derivative. If the Cys25 thiol were to covalently bind directly to the purine ring of compound 3, significant chemical shift perturbations on par with those observed for compound 2 would have been observed for the reporter groups. Collectively, the NMR titration data suggests a possible weak transient non-covalent interaction between cruzain and compound 3. The NMR data also verifies the previously reported cruzain-compound 2 binding mode: 24 the Cys25 thiol sulfur is covalently bonded to the nitrile group, and not directly to the purine group of the inhibitor.

Conversely for the non-covalent inhibitors, greater than 20 fold excess compound was required before apparent maximum chemical shift perturbations were reached. A comparison of the 15 N-Cys data (Supplemental Figure S5 ) reveals distinct patterns: the covalently bound inhibitors impart chemical shift perturbations on the catalytic Cys25 greater than 0.5 ppm, while the non-covalent compounds display values less than 0.15 ppm for all the cysteine reporter groups. In the case of the 15 N-His data (Supplemental Figure S6) , the chemical shift perturbation values of the catalytic His162 observed for the K777 and compound 2 titrations appear to have reached a maximum value at 2.5 fold excess compounds, with no significant differences at 20 fold excess inhibitor. Conversely, although significant perturbations are observed for His162 upon addition of 2.5 equivalents of the non-covalent inhibitors, such as compounds 4, 6, and 7, further changes in the chemical shift resonances are observed at 20 fold excess. Similar patterns are observed in the Met68 (Supplemental Figure S7 ).",

With the exception of the non-interactors/aggregators, titration of each compound using these cruzain samples perturbed the chemical shifts of residues at or near the active site. Importantly, these NMR titrations verified previously reported in silico docking results of selected non-covalently binding compounds, 13 including those for which there are no existing crystallographic data sets. Using current NMR automation technology with samples contained in standard 5 mm NMR tubes, a binary binding experiment (i.e. apo versus greater than 20 fold excess compound) can be performed in 1 to 2 hours per sample. The rate of data acquisition can be further enhanced using NMR flow-cells and 96 well plate sampling attachments, which requires smaller sample volumes. 25 This has the added advantage of allowing for higher protein and inhibitor concentrations relative to the standard 5 mm tubes, and more importantly, faster data acquisition times.",

Met68 and Met145 (orange), both located on the surface of the substrate binding pocket, and the relatively unstructured N-terminal region (residues 1-24, brown cartoon), are also indicated. (d) The cruzain active site, represented as a 90\u00b0 rotation about the horizontal axis with respect to parts (a-c). The positions of the catalytic Gln19 (blue), Cys25 (red), His162 (cyan), and Asn182 (green) amide groups are indicated with balls. Orange balls denote positions of the Met68 and Met145 \u03b5-methyl groups; purple balls denote positions of the Met52 and Met152 \u03b5-methyl groups. A cluster of tryptophan residues (Trp184, dark red; Trp188, brown; and Trp144, pink) connects Met145 and Met152 with His162. Glu208 (light green), which forms a portion of the S2 pocket, is also displayed. The van der Waal surfaces of the tryptophan cluster and Glu208 are indicated by meshes. Surface representation of the cruzain active site with (e) and without (f) the K777 structure. Residue colors are the same as part (d). Chemical shift perturbation data of cruzain reporter groups with K777. The HSQC titration spectra of selectively labeled (a) 15 N-Cys, (b) 15 N-His, and (d) 13 C-Met cruzain with 0 (black) and 10 or 20 (red) molar equivalents of K777. Solid boxes indicate residues located in the substrate binding pocket. Dotted lines correspond to other perturbed residues. The chemical shift perturbations relative to the apo state at 2.5 (black) and 10 or 20 (red) molar equivalents K777 observed for the selectively labeled (d) 15 N-Cys, (e) 15 ",
