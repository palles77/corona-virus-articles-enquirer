            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious enteric infection of swine caused by a transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (Woode, 1969) . The causative agent of TGE belongs to the Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped viruses possessing a single-stranded co-linear RNA genome of positive polarity (for review, see Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . Three major structural proteins have been described for all coronaviruses: a high tool. wt. (220 kDa) glycoprotein (S) which forms the characteristic peplomers of the \"corona\", a small (29 kDa) transmembrane glycoprotein (M) and a phosphorylated protein (N, 47-50 kDa) associated with RNA (Garwes and Pocock, 1975; Garwes et al., 1976; Horzinek et al., 1982; Laude et al., 1986) . The peplomer glycoprotein is assumed to be involved in both virus adsorption to the cell and induction of virus-neutralizing antibody (Garwes et al., 1978) . The transmembrane glycoprotein is postulated to play a key role in alpha-interferon induction (Charley and Laude, 1988) . TGEV infection is followed by a very high mortality rate of up to 100 % in piglets which are less than 2 weeks old (Haelterman, 1972) . Sows that are naturally exposed to the virulent TGEV produce immune milk, which passively protects newborn pigs (Saif and Bohl, 1981; Bachman, 1982) . In contrast, attenuated TGEV does not induce complete protection by lactogenic immunity (Salf and Bohl, 1981) .",

Using the same m.o.i, of D-52 strain and 188-SG mutant, the patterns of expression of viral antigens in infected cells were also multimodal (data not shown). This phenomenon was due to incomplete infection of cell monolayers, which led to multi-cycle multiplication of virus. Laude et al. (1986) found that about 20 070 of ST cells expressed S antigen at 20 h p.i. when cells were infected at a m.o.i, of 2.5 x 10-2pFU/cell of Purdue-115 virus. In order to have glycoproteins appearing at the cell surface under single-cycle conditions of viral multiplication, a high m.o.i. (10 PFU/celI) was chosen to ensure that all cells were infected. It is interesting to note that the levels of expression of surface M and S antigens of the 3 virus strains were not significantly different when cells were infected with high m.o.i. (10 PFU/cell) ( fig. 2 ). This observation implies that the capacity to express glycoproteins on the cell membrane was not a marker for differentiating HP and LP TGEV strains. For all 3 mutant viruses used, surface virus antigen quantity was significantly lower with the RP.D cells than with the ST cells. This could be explained by the influence of cell culture systems on virus replication and synthesis of viral antigens (Nguyen et al., I987) . Furthermore, the appearance of the M and S antigens on the outer membrane of the cells could depend on an antigen-processing system, as previously described for other viruses (Long and Jacobson, 1989; Yewdell et al., 1981) .",
