MERS-CoV 3CL protease is essential for viral replication; consequently, it is an attractive target that provides a potentially effective means of developing small molecule therapeutics for combatting MERS-CoV. We describe herein the structure-guided design and evaluation of a novel class of inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CL protease that embody a piperidine moiety as a design element that is well-suited to exploiting favorable subsite binding interactions to attain optimal pharmacological activity and PK properties. The mechanism of action of the compounds and the structural determinants associated with binding were illuminated using X-ray crystallography.",

Coronavirus entry is initiated by the binding of the spike protein (S) to cell receptors, specifically, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively [1e5] . Entry into cells requires host proteases for cleavage at two sites in the S protein, in the case of most CoV [13, 14] Translation of the genomic mRNA of ORF1a yields polyprotein pp1a, while a second polyprotein (pp1b) is the product of a ribosomal frame shift that joins ORF1a together with ORF1b. ORF1a encodes a papain-like cysteine protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro). Polyproteins pp1a and pp1b are processed by 3CLpro (11 cleavage sites) and PLpro (3 cleavage sites) resulting in sixteen mature nonstructural proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase, which play important roles in the transcription and replication of coronaviruses (Fig. 1 ). Both proteases are essential for viral replication, making them attractive targets for drug development [9,10,15e17] .",

Specifically, administration of GC376 to cats infected with FIPV, a coronavirus that is 100% fatal in cats, reversed the progression of fatal FIP and resulted in clinical remission in a majority of animals (>90%). Since FIP disease progression is quite rapid and its pathogenesis primarily immune-mediated, features shared by MERS-CoV, we hypothesized that a viral protease inhibitor could reverse the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in affected hosts. Interrogation of this hypothesis entailed, as a first step, the design of a new and versatile class of peptidomimetic inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CL protease. We describe herein the structure-guided design of inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CLpro that embody a piperidine moiety as a novel design element, as well as pertinent structural and biochemical studies.

            "text": "The structure-guided design of inhibitor (I) encompassed the following steps: (a) we first determined a high resolution X-ray crystal structure of MERS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with GC376 ( Fig. 2/Panel A) . Examination of the active site of the complex revealed that the aldehyde bisulfite adduct had reverted to the precursor peptidyl aldehyde, which subsequently formed a tetrahedral hemi-thioacetal upon reaction with the active site Cys148. Notably, the electron density at this stereocenter was consistent with the formation of both R and S enantiomers at the covalent binding site (also observed for the other structures described in the following sections). The structure reveals a network of backbone hydrogen bonds which ensure correct positioning of the inhibitor to the active site, as well as two critical hydrogen bonds with the P 1 Gln surrogate [26] side chain. The inhibitor P 2 Leu side chain is ensconced in the hydrophobic S 2 subsite of the enzyme. Importantly, the structure shows a hydrophobic-driven interaction between the benzyl group of the inhibitor and the g-lactam ring of the Gln surrogate side chain; (b) based on the forgoing, we reasoned that extending the \"cap\" would allow the inhibitor to assume an extended conformation and orient the phenyl ring toward the hydrophobic S 4 pocket of the enzyme. Validation of this idea was obtained by synthesizing extended inhibitor GC813 and determining a high resolution X-ray crystal structure of the MERS-CoV 3CLpro:GC813 complex ( Fig. 2/Panel B) . The m-Cl phenethyl side chain is clearly shown to occupy the hydrophobic S 4 subsite. In addition to an array of H-bonds with Gln192, Glu169, and Gln167 and the backbone of the inhibitor, which serve to correctly position the inhibitor at the active site, the inhibitor interacts with the S 1 , S 2 and S 4 subsites, but not the S 3 subsite; (c) we hypothesized that the attachment of a piperidine ring to the peptidyl component would yield a structurally novel peptidomimetic (I) capable of (1) orienting recognition elements R 3 and R 4 in a correct vector relationship for optimal interactions with the S 3 and S 4 subsites, (2) rendering a dipeptidyl inhibitor equivalent to a tetrapeptidyl inhibitor with potentially diminished PK liabilities and, (3) providing a flexible means for the structure-guided parallel optimization of ADMET/PK and physicochemical properties using diversity sites R 3 and R 4 in inhibitor (I) (Fig. 3) . In summary, the piperidine-based design strategy is a hitherto unrecognized effective means of rendering a dipeptidyl inhibitor equivalent to a tetrapeptidyl inhibitor capable of engaging in optimal binding interactions with all four S 1 -S 4 subsites but which, however, is anticipated to display diminished PK liabilities due to its reduced peptidyl character. Furthermore, the aforementioned piperidine-based design strategy has wide applicability and can be extended to any protease with an extended binding site. Preliminary evidence in support of this approach is provided by the results of enzyme and cell-based screening of derivatives of (I) (Tables 1 and 2) , as well as the results of structural studies (vide infra) (see Table 3 ).",

Subsequent coupling with glutamine surrogate methyl ester hydrochloride 11 afforded the desired dipeptidyl esters (6a, 6c and 6e) which were either treated with lithium borohydride directly or were first treated with dry HCl in dioxane followed by reaction with an alkyl sulfonyl chloride or alkyl chloroformate, to yield esters (7b, 7d and 7f) prior to reduction with lithium borohydride, to yield alcohols 8 (a-f).

The formation of a tetrahedral adduct via the reaction of the aldehyde, generated from aldehyde bisulfite adduct 10c under the crystallization conditions used [27, 28] , with the active site cysteine (Cys148) is clearly evident, confirming the mechanism of action of (I). Inspection of the structure reveals the presence of prominent electron density consistent with the structure of inhibitor 10c; however, the N-Bocpiperidinyl moiety was disordered. The position and orientation of the benzyl group suggest that the piperidine ring is likely projecting toward the S 4 subsite. Inhibitor 10c is bound to the active site of the enzyme via a network of backbone H-bonds with Gln192, Gln167, and Glu169 (Fig. 5B ). Additionally, a H-bond with His41 serves to stabilize the hemi-thioacetal tetrahedral adduct. Also clearly evident are three critical H-bonds involving the P 1 Gln surrogate ring oxygen and nitrogen with Glu169, His166 and Phe143. The H-bonding interactions are near identical to those of inhibitor GC813 (Fig. 2/Panel B) .

The expression and purification of the 3CLpro of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or FIPV was performed by a standard method described previously by our lab [24, 29] . The protease (3CLpro of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or FIPV) was mixed with serial dilutions of each compound or with DMSO in 25 mL of assay buffer and incubated at 37 C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 25 mL of assay buffer containing substrate. Fluorescence readings were obtained using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm on a fluorescence microplate reader (FLx800; Biotec, Winoosk, VT) 1 h following the addition of substrate. Relative fluorescence units (RFU) were determined by subtracting background values (substrate-containing well without protease) from the raw fluorescence values, as described previously [29] .

High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed at the University of Kansas Mass Spectrometry lab using an LCT Premier mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) equipped with a time of flight mass analyzer and an electrospray ion source. The purity of the compounds was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Alliance HPLC system with a reverse phase column (Symmetry \u00ae C18 3.5 mm, 4.6 \u00c2 75 mm) and a Varian Pro-star HPLC system with a normal phase column (Kinetex 2.6u HILIC 100A, 75 \u00c2 4.6 mm) at 254 nm.
