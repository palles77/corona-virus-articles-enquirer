Immunoprecipitations of [ 35S]methionine-pulse-labeled viral proteins demonstrated that viral protein synthesis occurs early in the infection, concurrent with the peak of viral subgenomic RNA synthesis.

Hemagglutination by BCV appears to be the property of a fourth major structural protein, the hemagglutinin (King and Brian, 1982) . Thus, BCV is comprised of four major structural proteins, a 190 kDa peplomeric protein (P or E2), (present on the vii-ions as subunits of 120 and 100 kDa), a 140 kDa hemagglutinin protein (H or E3) (made up of two disulfide-linked subunits of 65 kDa), a 26 kDa matrix protein (M or El), and a 52 kDa nucleocapsid protein (N). Because BCV has a significantly slower growth cycle than MHV, 48 to 72 h as compared to 12, BCV provides a potentially useful system to study the regulation of coronavirus RNA synthesis. The presence of a fourth structural protein also suggests that an additional mRNA species might be synthesized by BCV. Little is known about the molecular biology of BCV RNA synthesis.",

Thus, the relative ratio of all of the intracellular RNAs remains the same during infection. The viral genomic RNA gradually accumulates throughout the infection. However, no clear-cut switching from transcription of subgenomic mRNAs to replication of genomic-sized RNA is seen. Thus, it is not known whether there is a temporal regulation of viral RNA synthesis in coronavirus-infected cells.

This experiment presumes the 3'coterminal nested set arrangement for BCV mRNAs. RNA patterns identical to those of in vivo labeled RNA species were obtained (Fig. lB) , confirming that all 7 subgenomic RNA species detected are BCV-specific RNAs. The abundance of genomic RNA was relatively low in this RNA preparation. However, longer exposure of the autoradiogram did show the presence of the genomic RNA (mRNA l), the size of which is nearly identical to that of MHV (data not shown). The same RNA patterns were obtained from either BEK or L2 cells infected with BCV (data not shown). To further demonstrate the 3'-coterminal nested-set structure, we used a cDNA probe representing 3'-end sequences only, that excluded the intergenic sequences and the poly A tail, to hybridize to BCV intracellular RNA. The same eight RNA species were detected (data not shown). This result established that all of the BCV RNA species contain 3'-overlapping sequences. The most likely explanation is that BCV RNAs also have a nested-set, 3'-coterminal structure, similar to other coronaviruses (Lai et al., 1981) .",

Thus, it was of interest to determine when viral proteins were synthesized. BCV-infected cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 2-h periods beginning at different time points p.i., and viral proteins were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies specific for BCV and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4) . Although not all virus structural proteins could be identified, it is evident from the appearance of the two major protein species, N and M (El), that the peak of viral protein synthesis took place between 4 and 8 h p.i., coinciding with the peak of subgenomic mRNA synthesis. The synthesis of M protein appears to be slightly later than that of N various modified forms of M protein. The heterogeneity of N and M (El) proteins has previously been noted in several other coronaviruses (Stem and Sefton, 1982; Robbins et al., 1986) . Late in infection (between 20 and 46 h p.i.), a cellular protein also co-migrated with one of the M proteins (Fig. 4) . The nature of this protein is unclear. The antibody used could not detect the P (E2) (gp 120-100) or H (E3) (gp 65) proteins (unpubl. data). These results suggest that the viral subgenomic mRNAs are used for translation immediately following synthesis. The viral proteins synthesized probably form a pool, from which virus particles are assembled. To test this probability, the viral proteins synthesized at different time points in HRT and BEK cells were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a filter membrane and probed with a mixture of BCV-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. It is evident from Fig. 5 that viral proteins persist in BCV-infected HRT cells even late in infection. Similar results were obtained in either HRT or BEK cells (data not shown). It is notable that the H protein (gp 65) and the cleavage products of P protein, ~120 and ~100, were detected by the Western blot technique (Fig. 5) . The kinetics of accumulation of these proteins was similar to that of other BCV proteins. This result together with the data on the kinetics of protein synthesis (Fig. 4 ) indicates that sufficient viral proteins are synthesized early in infection and persist throughout replication cycle. Thus, the limiting component in BCV virus assembly could be the virion genomic RNA. Some proteins which migrated between N and M were also detected by immunoblotting.",

            "text": "The data presented in this report indicate that the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs and of genomic RNA in BCV-infected cells are differentially regulated. The subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized very early in infection, while the majority of genomic RNA is synthesized late. Since the peak of genomic RNA synthesis (40-72 h p.i.) coincides with the peak of maximum virus yield, it is likely that the genomic RNA synthesized late in infection represents the genomic RNA packaged into virus particles. Thus, this report is the first example of differential regulation of transcription and replication of coronavirus RNAs. It is not clear whether this differential regulation is characteristic of all coronaviruses. The previous failure to detect such differential regulation in other coronaviruses may be due to shorter replication cycles in those viruses. It should be noted that the genome-sized RNA contains two functionally different species that may or may not be structurally identical. One is the mRNA 1 which is presumably used for translation to produce RNA polymerase, and the other is the RNA destined for packaging into vu-ions. It is probable that the genome-size RNA synthesized early in infection consists mainly of the mRNA 1 species which is required for production of RNA polymerase needed for subsequent RNA replication. Our data also showed that the viral proteins are synthesized early in infection immediately following mRNA synthesis and accumulate throughout the replication cycle. Since the release of virus particles coincides with the synthesis of genomic RNA, it is likely that the rate-limiting step in BCV infection and particle assembly is the synthesis of genomic RNA. We cannot rule out, however, the possibility that synthesis of some nonstructural proteins or processing of a structural protein might also be differentially regulated and thus may also play a role in late virus assembly. Since we could not detect the synthesis of P or H proteins by immunoprecipitation, the role of these proteins in regulating virus assembly cannot be ruled out. However, the kinetics of the accumulation of these proteins is similar to other viral structural proteins (Fig. 5) . Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that P and H proteins are also synthesized with the same kinetics as the other viral proteins.",

One of the two enzyme fractions of MHV codes for genomic RNA while the other codes for both genomic and subgenomic RNAs . Temporal separation of these two activities was not investigated. The viral RNA polymerase activity in BCV-infected cells has so far not been studied. It would be of interest to determine whether BCV RNA polymerase activities could be separated into temporally regulated enzymatic fractions. Since the transcription of subgenomic mRNA species utilizes a discontinuous leader-primed transcription mechanism (Baric et al., 1985) , which is different from the replication of genomic RNA, it is reasonable to suggest that the polymerases responsible for the synthesis of these two RNA species are different, or are modified forms of the same polymerase.It is not clear what proteins are responsible for such a switching or modification.Since the transcription and replication of BCV RNA can be clearly separated, BCV may provide a very useful system for studying the regulation of transcription and replication. Although BCV and MHV are related antigenically, their protein compositions differ in that BCV contains an additional protein species, namely the hemagglutinin which is a 140 kDa glycoprotein composed of two 65 kDa subunits, that is not found in MHV. Consistent with this property is the presence of an additional (7 instead of 6) subgenomic RNA species in the BCV-infected cells, which is not found in MHV-infected cells. This RNA has a molecular weight of approximately 3.1 x 106. Since BCV subgenomic mRNAs have a nested-set structure, the maximum coding capacity of this new RNA species should be the difference between the molecular weights of this RNA, 2a, and the next smaller mRNA (RNA 3, with a molecular weight of approximately 2.6 x 106). This size difference (0.5 X 106) corresponds to a coding capacity of approximately 430 amino acids. This value is comparable to the estimated protein backbone of the hemagglutinin (Hogue et al., 1984; Ring and Brian, 1982; Ring et al., 1985) . Thus, it is likely that the mRNA 2a is the RNA encoding the hemagglutinin protein. However, this gene assignment will require confirmation from in vitro translation studies, which are currently infeasible because of the small quantity of intracellular RNAs available.",
