Moreover, lesions in macaques infected experimentally with hMPV isolated from a non-SARS individual 7 were limited to mild suppurative rhinitis and minimal erosion in conducting airways, and disease was not exacerbated in two SCV-infected macaques subsequently inoculated with hMPV (results not shown).
