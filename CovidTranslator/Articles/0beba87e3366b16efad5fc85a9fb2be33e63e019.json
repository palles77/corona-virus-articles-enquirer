Horizontal transmissible protection against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorragic disease using a recombinant myxoma virus. J. Virol. 2000;74:1114\u00b123]. Administration of the recombinant virus protects rabbits against lethal RHDV and MV challenges. Furthermore, the recombinant virus is capable of horizontal spreading promoting protection of contact animals, thus providing the opportunity to immunize wild rabbit populations. However, potential risks must be extensively evaluated before considering its \u00aeeld use. In this study several safety issues concerning the proposed vaccine have been evaluated under laboratory conditions. Results indicated that vaccine administration is safe even at a 100-fold overdose. No undesirable eects were detected upon administration to immunosuppressed or pregnant rabbits. The recombinant virus maintained its attenuated phenotype after 10 passages in vivo. 7",

Myxoma virus (MV), the causative agent of myxomatosis, belongs to the Leporipoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family [1] . In its natural host, Sylvilagus rabbits in the Americas, MV induces a mild benign infection. In European rabbits however, MV causes the systemic and lethal infection known as myxomatosis [2, 3] . The disease is endemic in the entire rabbit range in Europe since the deliberate release of MV in France (1952) as a biological control agent of wild rabbit populations. Immunization of domestic rabbits against myxomatosis is currently achieved using heterologous vaccines based on Shope \u00aebroma virus, a less virulent Leporipoxvirus, or homologous vaccines based on cell culture-attenuated strains of MV [4, 5] .",

Infected rabbits usually die within 48\u00b172 h of necrotising hepatitis. RHD is responsible for high economic losses in rabbitries as well as high mortality rates in wild rabbit populations [8\u00b112] . The etiological agent, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), is a member of the Caliciviridae family [13] . The RHDV virions are non-enveloped and icosahedral, with capsids composed of a major protein component of 60 kDa (VP60). Commercial vaccines against RHD are prepared from the livers of experimentally infected rabbits [14] , since in vitro systems are not available for ecient virus propagation. In the last years, the VP60 gene has been successfully expressed in several heterologous systems [15\u00b123] and has been shown to induce full protection of rabbits against a lethal challenge with RHDV.",

In order to protect wild rabbits against both myxomatosis and RHD, we constructed a recombinant virus based on the naturally attenuated MV \u00aeeld strain 6918 [24] , that expressed the RHDV VP60 protein [25] . A linear epitope tag from the nucleoprotein of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) was included within the recombinant VP60 protein to allow monitoring the spread of the recombinant virus in the environment. Following inoculation of rabbits, the recombinant virus (6918VP60-T2) induced speci\u00aec antibody responses against MV, RHDV as well as for the TGEV tag. Administration of 6918VP60-T2 by the subcutaneous, intradermal or oral routes protected rabbits against lethal RHDV and MV challenges. Furthermore, the recombinant 6918VP60-T2 virus showed a limited horizontal transmission capacity, either by direct contact or in a\u00afea-mediated process, promoting immunization of contact uninoculated animals [25] .",

The virus obtained from the last passage was titrated and the eects of inoculating 10 4 pfu by s.c. in a group of eight rabbits were evaluated as described above and compared with those of the original recombinant virus.

The oral route is considered a feasible way of vaccine administration. For example, oral vaccination is being used to control enzootic sylvatic rabies in Europe and North America by means of a recombinant vaccinia-rabies vaccine delivered by baiting [26] . An alternative strategy is the use of`t ransmissible vaccines'', i.e., viral vectors capable of spreading within an animal population. Hopefully, the administration of a recombinant vaccine of this characteristics to a small number of captured individuals, would eventually lead to the immunization of a fraction of animals within a given population, which is sucient to reduce the spread of the target disease. This approach might be useful, especially when the distribution, size, and turnover rate of a population precludes capture or baiting techniques as the only means for antigen delivery. The European rabbit is an example of such a population. With this in mind, we have developed a transmissible vaccine against both myxomatosis and RHD based on a recombinant MV-VP60 virus capable of spreading through rabbit populations [25] . The results obtained under laboratory conditions suggest the recombinant virus might be eective for wild rabbit immunization. However, since the proposed use of 6918VP60-T2 involves the environmental release of a recombinant virus, considerations regarding safety issues are as important as the potential ecacy of the candidate vaccine. It is for this reason that safety concerns have been at the core of the rational design of the proposed immunization strategy.",

MV exhibits a very restricted host range, infecting exclusively rabbits (both Sylvilagus and Oryctolagus spp.). The virus has been widely distributed throughout Europe, Australia and the Americas for nearly 50 years with no evidence of infection of other species. Thus, the host restricted nature of MV minimises the risk of recombinant vaccine spreading to non-target species in nature. On the other hand, given the current widespread geographic distribution of MV, which is similar to the distribution of RHDV, the \u00aeeld use of a recombinant MV-VP60 vaccine would normally not involve the introduction of a virus species that does not already exist in a particular area. Safety aspects were also considered in the choice of the parental MV strain. It was decided not to use one of the available vaccinal strains, obtained by cell culture-attenuation of virulent MV strains [5] , as this would involve the release of a new strain to the environment, which might undergo reversion to virulence in nature. Instead, we decided to use an attenuated MV \u00aeeld strain which was already circulating among wild rabbit populations. Strain 6918 was selected from a \u00aeeld survey of MV strains circulating in Spain, which were analysed for virulence and transmissibility [24] . This strain exhibited adequate biological characteristics for the development of a recombinant transmissible vaccine, as it caused a non-pathogenic infection comparable to that of cell culture-attenuated vaccinal strains, yet retaining the capacity of horizontal spreading [24] .",

Moreover, the VP60 expression cassette was inserted into the MV genome using the TDS twostep selection system [28] . This procedure enables the construction of recombinant poxviruses without any marker genes inserted in the \u00aenal recombinant viral genome. Thus, the recombinant 6918VP60-T2 does not harbour selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes, the widespread of which is currently regarded as a major health and environmental threat. Considering the potential risks associated with the DNA sequence inserted, it should be noted that the VP60 gene has been cloned in a wide range of heterologous systems[15\u00b123] and no indication of toxicity or side eects associated to the expression of VP60 have been reported.",

In this report we have extended the safety assessment of the vaccine by analysing the potential Table 5 Eects Concerning vaccine dosage and the possibility of accidental administration of an overdose, the results demonstrated vaccine safety even when a 100-fold overdose (10 6 PFU) was inoculated (Fig. 1, Table 2 ). Assessment of vaccine eects in immunosuppressed rabbits was considered relevant, given the incidence in nature of immunocompromised individuals due to infections, environmental or genetic causes. For this reason we assayed the eect of vaccine administration in rabbits treated with prednisolone, a potent immunosuppressor. This treatment induces depletion of circulating eosinophils and mononuclear cells, causing a strong decrease of the T-cell response with only a slight eect on B-cell function [29] . It is a commonly used procedure for the safety evaluation of veterinary vaccines [30\u00b132] . Results showed that prednisolone treated rabbits exhibited similar symptoms to those observed in control rabbits (Fig. 2 , Table 3 ). The only remarkable observation was that immunosuppressed rabbits showed a subtle tendency to delay the resolution of local lesions: 16\u00b118 dpi vs. 15 dpi (Fig. 2) . Another important aspect addressed was the eect of 6918VP60-T2 virus infection in reproduction. Results showed that recombinant virus inoculation did not alter the reproduction parameters and none of the rabbits born from vaccinated does showed myxomatosisassociated clinical signs (Table 4 ). In conclusion, the overall results obtained demonstrate a notable lack of adverse eects attributable to the recombinant virus, regardless of dose, route or life history stage of individuals (i.e., neonate, young, pregnant does or immunocompromised).",

The environmental release of recombinant 6918VP60-T2 virus would involve a certain number of serial passages in its natural host, even when this capability seemed to be limited to only two serial passages under laboratory conditions [25] . Should there be a tendency for the virus to evolve to a virulent state, serial passage in rabbits would cause it to do so. Accordingly, the biological stability of 6918VP60-T2 was studied by subjecting the virus to 10 serial passages in rabbits, and the results obtained (Fig. 3 , Table 5 ) indicated the recombinant virus maintained grossly the same biological characteristics through the passages. Thus, the attenuated nature of 6918VP60-T2 seems to be a stable trait. On the other hand, the genetic analysis indicated that the VP60 gene remained stably integrated in the MV genome after serial passage in rabbits, in agreement with the previously reported results obtained after 15 serial passages of 6918VP60-T2 virus in RK-13 cell monolayers [25] .",
