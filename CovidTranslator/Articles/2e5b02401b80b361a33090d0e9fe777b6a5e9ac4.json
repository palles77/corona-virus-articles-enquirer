To determine risk factors for RTIs while accounting for variable observation time, rates of RTIs per 1000 resident-days among those with and without specific demographic characteristics, CCCs, and devices were calculated and compared. A generalized linear mixed model regression using negative binomial distribution was used to determine independent risk factors for RTIs while accounting for clustering by site. Possible risk factors for RTIs included age, sex, and race; use of devices (eg, central venous catheters, nasogastric tubes, and other tubes [ie, gastric, jejunal, and gastrojejunal feeding tubes]), tracheostomies, ventilators, and baclofen pumps (device for intrathecal antispasticity medication); and overall number and selected types of CCCs. Ventriculoperitoneal shunts were excluded because only 2 residents with these devices developed an RTI during the study period. Age and number of CCCs were included as continuous variables in the models. Site-level clustering helped to control for group-level differences, whereas negative binomial modeling was used to correct for overdispersion of the data. Factors with a significance of P < .10 in the bivariate analysis were then incorporated into the multivariable model. The ANOVA test was used to assess significant differences between groups. Two-sided P < .05 was considered significant. All t tests were 2-sided. The final model was constructed using the manual backward-elimination method of dropping the variable with the largest P value first. Final evaluation of RTI risk factors was based on the multivariable model examining fixed effects at a 2-sided 5% level of significance.

            "text": "The pLTCF population requires an intense level of care because of its high rates of chronic conditions and device use. Most of the 717 residents in this study were nonambulatory, and most had 4 or more CCCs. More than half required feeding tubes, and nearly one-third had tracheostomies. The study population was also young, with a median age at enrollment of 2.6 years. Infections also had a substantial effect on acute care resources, as 7.0% of residents with infections were hospitalized. Although relatively few studies describe infections in pLTCFs, like the present study all found that RTIs were most common. 10, 17, 18 These data contrast with the types of infections reported among adults residing in long-term care facilities and children in acute care populations. Urinary tract infections are generally reported to be the most common infection in adult long-term care facilities, 19, 20 while pneumonia, surgical-site infections, and gastrointestinal infections (including Clostridium difficile) are the most commonly reported infections among hospitalized children. 21 In pLTCFs, there are numerous opportunities for exposure to and transmission of potential pathogens, particularly respiratory viruses. 10, 11, 22 Residents require numerous medical interventions, specialized equipment, and rehabilitative and recreational services provided by staff with specialized skills. 12, 22 The facilities' physical structure may also contribute to pathogen transmission because of multibed resident bedrooms, common eating areas, and on-site schools. Furthermore, social and physical interactions are valued; thus, residents are in close contact with other residents, staff, volunteers, and visitors of all ages. 23 Residents may exhibit behaviors that contribute to transmission, such as difficulty adhering to respiratory and hand hygiene regimens. 24, 25 Pathogens circulating in the community can infect residents and staff and evolve into clusters of cases or large outbreaks. 9 During the study period, 62 outbreaks were reported to the New York State Department of Health, affecting 819 residents. Most of these outbreaks were caused by respiratory viruses, which can be associated with more severe disease and potentially death in this vulnerable population. 9, 26 Despite high rates of resident and staff influenza vaccination (>90%), influenza species were associated costs associated with RTIs are typically 10-fold higher during the respiratory viral season. 27 Respiratory viruses were more common than bacteria, and many of the bacteria detected were consistent with community-acquired pathogens, such as group A streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. These findings contrast with the results of a survey conducted among staff at pLTCFs: 76% of respondents ranked multidrug-resistant bacteria as the infection control issue of greatest importance in their facility. Systematic surveys of antimicrobial susceptibility data from pLTCFs are lacking. 28 We found that younger children are at increased risk of respiratory viral infections likely because of both immunologic and behavioral characteristics. Many children with CCCs are at increased risk of RTIs because of the difficulty of handling their secretions and/or aspiration. Device use is associated with increased contact with staff and therefore an increased risk of transmission of pathogens. 22, 24 Feeding tubes could increase the risk of aspiration, although nasogastric tubes were not found to be a risk factor for RTIs. We speculate that this lack of effect reflects the shorter duration of use of nasogastric tubes, which are likely replaced by more permanent enteral feeding tubes. 29 None of the patient risk factors we found are likely modifiable in this population. However, infection rates varied among the sites, suggesting that other factors (eg, unmeasured patient factors and differences in site infrastructure, architecture, and/or infection prevention and control strategies) could be modifiable risk factors. One site demonstrated that sequential implementation of infection prevention and control policies directed at RTIs (including mandatory staff influenza vaccination) led to a significant decline in RTIs associated with outbreaks and influenza, although the overall RTI rate increased. 30 However, the optimal infection prevention and control practices are uncertain for the pLTCF population. 28 ",

The study sites may not be representative of all pLTCFs and were participating in a study to improve hand hygiene rates to reduce infections. 13 However, the behavioral interventions did not lead to consistent improvement in hand hygiene. Other pLTCFs may not have ready access to viral diagnostic testing. Device-days were not collected; thus, infection rates by device-days could not be calculated. Some residents were regularly catheterized to manage neurogenic bladder, but these data were not collected. Validated case definitions for health care-associated infections in pLTCFs do not exist, which may contribute to differences in infection rates at the sites. 14 We defined infections as those diagnosed by the site clinicians. This definition could have overestimated infection rates if site clinicians considered colonizing flora (eg, asymptomatic bacteriuria or prolonged viral shedding) to represent infection. Furthermore, infection rates could have been underestimated infections if site clinicians did not consider a change in clinical status to be an infectious process. We could describe only a minority of pathogens causing bloodstream infections because blood cultures were often obtained in acute care facilities and susceptibility testing was often unavailable. Not all infections had laboratory or radiologic confirmation; for example, pneumonia was usually a clinical diagnosis because the sites did not have on-site radiologic capacity. Finally, the crude mortality rate may be an underestimate given that deaths that occurred in acute care facilities were not available in the sites' medical records. ",
