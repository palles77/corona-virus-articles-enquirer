            "text": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a serious leading health complication emerging expansively that has severely affected the survival rate of human beings. This fatal disease is caused by JE Virus (JEV). The current study was carried out for designing a multi-epitope loaded peptide vaccine to prevent JEV. Based on reverse vaccinology and in silico approaches, octapeptide B-cell and hexapeptide T-cell epitopes belonging to five proteins, viz. E, prM, NS1, NS3 and NS5 of JEV were determined. Hydrophilicity, antigenicity, immunogenicity and aliphatic amino acids of the epitopes were estimated. Further, the epitopes were analyzed for different physicochemical parameters, e.g. total net charges, amino acid composition and Boman index. Out of all the epitopes, a total of four T-cell epitopes namely KRADSS, KRSRRS, SKRSRR and KECPDE and one B-cell epitope i.e. PKPCSKGD were found to have potential for raising immunity in human against the pathogen. Taking into account the outcome of this study, the pharmaceutical industries could initiate efforts to combine the identified epitopes together with adjuvant or carrier protein to develop a multi-epitope-loaded peptide vaccine against JEV. The peptide vaccine, being cost effective, could be administered as a prophylactic measure and in JEV infected individuals to combat the spread of this virus in human population. However, prior to administration into human beings, the vaccine must pass through several clinical trials.",

The causal agent of the disease is JE virus (JEV). JEV is transmitted by mosquitoes and is categorized into genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae (Westaway et al., 1985) . JEV severely affects the central nervous system of human and results into infectious disease. The transmission cycle of JEV occurs between mosquitoes and birds or swine. However, the transmission of the virus to humans usually takes place through infected mosquitoes of the species, Culex tritaeniorrhynchus (Porterfield, 1995) . JEV is found to prevail in many Asian nations namely India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Taiwan, Siberia, Cambodia, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia. The JE epidemic has spread from Eastern Asia to Southeast and Southern Asia (Burke and Leake, 1988b; Oya, 1988; Vaughn and Hoke Jr, 1992; Endy and Nisalak, 2002; Mackenzie et al., 2006) . Apart from Asia, JE has affected many geographic regions of other continents as well, namely Northern Australia and Western Pacific (Paul et al., 1993; Hanna et al., 1996; Hanna et al., 1999) . The outbreak of JE was first observed in Japan during 1870s and the first isolate of JEV was obtained by culturing the brain cells of an infected individual in 1935 (Solomon et al., 2000) .",

JEV genome consists of a positive-sense single stranded RNA molecule of size 11 kb (Westaway et al., 1985) . The viral RNA synthesizes one polyprotein, which undergoes proteolytic cleavages within the JEVinfected cells and produces 10 proteins, viz. envelope (E), capsid (C), membrane (M or precursor membrane i.e. prM), NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 proteins (NS-non-structural) (Chambers et al., 1990; Marin et al., 1995; Rice, 1996; Zanotto et al., 1996) . The envelope of JEV, made up of glycoprotein, has a size of 50 nm. This envelope encircles the nucleocapsid formed by the joining of capsid and RNA. The E protein helps the virus adhere and penetrate into the host cell; in addition to helping at the time of membrane fusion (Allison et al., 2001; Kuhn et al., 2002) . The prM protein is secreted only during immature stage of the virion. At the later stage of viral infection, prM protein is broken down into M protein with the help of proteases. As a result, the virion develops into a mature virion. Sometimes, prM protein fails to break down into M protein (Bray and Lai, 1991) . In JEV-affected host cells, the virus produces NS1 protein externally and it acquires importance in virion maturation (Fan and Mason, 1990; Rice, 1996) . The two other proteins namely NS3 and NS5 help JEV undergo replication process (Rice et al., 1985; Bartholomeusz and Wright, 1993) .",

It, in fact, follows an in silico approach to screen the entire genome of the infectious pathogens to determine the epitopes of proteins that could be used as potential molecules for peptide vaccine formulation and development. In comparison to the traditional technique of vaccine design that requires laborious as well as expensive wet lab experiments, the reverse vaccinology approach relies mostly on genomic information and involves much lesser cost and time. The technique of reverse vaccinology provides enormous advantage in designing peptide vaccines against highly infectious pathogens, including those which cannot be cultured in lab due to high risk imposed on researchers and health professionals. Antigenic determinants or epitopes are the regions of the proteins that interact with the receptors on the T-cells or with antibodies produced by the B-cells and generate significant immune response in host. For this purpose, various bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify the potential epitopes for peptide vaccine formulation (Weiss and Littman, 1994) . Peptide vaccines are not only safer, less expensive and easily manufacturable but also require less time for manufacture as compared to the traditional vaccines (Von Hoff, 2005; Tang et al., 2012) . Unlike traditional vaccines, peptide vaccines do not cause autoimmune disorders or skin irritations (Skwarczynski and Toth, 2016) . Moreover, the newly discovered epitopes need to be well characterized for biological functions.",

The T-cell receptor binds with the antigen and causes its destruction (Lafuente and Reche, 2009 ). On the other hand, the destruction of antigen by B-cells takes place via the secretion of antibodies that interact with the antigen.

In order to design a peptide vaccine, the first criterion is to select the epitopes possessing high antigenicity scores. Out of 25 T-cell epitopes examined in five proteins of JEV, eight epitopes were identified to possess high antigenicity scores. These epitopes were EKRADS, KRSRRS, SKRSRR, DPEDVD, EDCGKR, KECPDE and KREKKP. The epitope EKRADS possessed low immunogenicity score and so, it was excluded from further analysis. The remaining seven epitopes possessed high immunogenicity and hydrophilicity values in addition to the desired Boman index value. On the basis of total net charges, three epitopes, i.e. DPEDVD, EDCGKR and KECPDE were excluded from the study as these might not bind with the virus. We concluded that four T- Among 25 octapeptide B-cell epitopes, seven epitopes namely DRYKYLPE, KPVGRYRS, PKPCSKGD, PSPKPCSK, DTPSPKPC, HKDPE-HPY and FYKPSEPS were estimated to possess high antigenicity scores.
