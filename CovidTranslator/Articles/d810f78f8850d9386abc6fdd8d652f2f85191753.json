Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.",

A range of interventions have been implemented following the detection in late December 2019 of a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology, and identification of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 in early January 2020 (2). Interventions include improved rates of diagnostic testing, clinical management, rapid isolation of suspected and confirmed cases and, most notably, restrictions on mobility (hereafter called cordon sanitaire) imposed on Wuhan city on 23 rd January. Travel restrictions were subsequently imposed on 14 other cities across Hubei Province and partial movement restrictions have been enacted in many cities across China. Initial analysis suggests that the Wuhan cordon sanitaire resulted in an average delay of COVID-19 spread to other cities of 3 days (3), but the true extent of the effect of the mobility restrictions and other types of interventions on transmission has not been examined in detail (4, 5).",

Reports of cases in China were mostly restricted to Hubei until 23 rd January 2020 (81% of all cases), after which most provinces reported rapid increases in cases (Fig. 1a) . We build a line list dataset from reported cases in China with information on travel history and demographic characteristics. We note that the majority of early cases (before 23 rd January 2020, Materials and Methods) reported outside of Wuhan had known travel history to Wuhan (57%) and were distributed across China (Fig. 1b) , highlighting the importance of Wuhan as the major source. However, testing was initially focused mainly on travelers to Wuhan, potentially biasing our estimates of travel related infections upwards (Materials and Methods). Among cases known to have traveled from Wuhan before 23 rd January 2020, the time from symptom onset to confirmation was 6.5 days (SD: 4.2, Fig. S2 ), providing opportunity for onward transmission at the destination. More active surveillance brought this interval down to 4.8 days (SD: 3.03, Fig. S2 ) for those who travelled after 23 rd January 2020.",

Since infection events are typically not directly observed, we estimate incubation period from the span of exposure during which infection likely occurred. Using detailed information on 38 cases for whom both the dates of entry to and exit from Wuhan are known, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 5.1 days (std. dev. = 3.0 days; Fig. S1 ), similar to previous estimates from other data (8, 9) . In subsequent analyses we add an upper estimate of one incubation period (mean + 1 standard deviation = 8 days) to the date of Wuhan shutdown, in order to delineate the date before which cases recorded in other provinces might represent infections acquired in Hubei (i.e. 1 st February 2020; Fig. 1a ). In order to understand whether the volume of travel within China can predict the epidemic outside of Wuhan, we analyzed real-time human mobility data from Baidu Inc., together with epidemiological data from each province (Materials and Methods). Small local transmission clusters (in a family) of COVID-19 were first reported in Guangzhou, Guangdong province (14) . We investigated spatio-temporal disease spread to elucidate the relative contribution of Wuhan to transmission elsewhere and evaluate how the cordon sanitaire may have impacted it.",

In the same period, we show that variation in the growth rates are almost entirely explained by human movements from Wuhan (Fig. 3c) , consistent with theory of infectious disease spread in highly coupled metapopulations (19, 20) . Following the implementation of drastic control measures across the country, growth rates become negative (Fig 3b) , indicating that transmission is being successfully mitigated. The correlation of growth rates and human mobility from Wuhan becomes negative, i.e. provinces with larger mobility prior to the cordon sanitaire (but also larger number of cases overall) have more rapidly declining growth rates of daily case counts. This could be partly due to travel restrictions but also the fact that control measures may have been more drastic in locations with larger outbreaks with local transmission (see more detail in section \"Current role of imported cases in Chinese provinces\"). The travel ban coincides with increased testing capacity across provinces in China. An alternative hypothesis is that the observed epidemiological patterns outside Wuhan are the result of increased testing capacity. We test this hypothesis by including differences in testing capacity before and after the rollout of large scale testing in China on 20 th of January 2020 and test its impact on the predictability of daily cases (Materials and Methods). We plot the relative improvement in the prediction of our model (based on normalized residual error) of (i) a model that includes mobility from Wuhan and (ii) a model that includes testing availability (see more details in Materials and Methods). Overall, the inclusion of mobility data from Wuhan produces a significant improvement in the models prediction (delta-BIC > 250, (24) ) over a naive model that considers only autochthonous transmission with a doubling time of 2-8 days (Fig. 3b) . Of the 27 provinces in China reporting cases through February 6 th , 2020, we find that in 12 provinces the largest improvements in prediction can be achieved using mobility only (Fig. S5) . In 10 provinces, both testing and mobility improve the models prediction and in only one province testing is the most important factor improving model prediction (Fig. S5) . We conclude that laboratory testing during the early phase of the epidemic is critical, however, mobility out of Wuhan remains the main driver of spread prior to the shutdown.",

Early cases with no information on travel history (category II) had a similar median age and sex ratio to those with known travel history (42 years old (50% interquartile interval: 30.5 -49.5, p-value > 0.1) and 1.80 males per female, Fig. 4d) . However, the sex ratio of later cases without reported travel history (category IV) shifted to approximately 1:1 (57 male vs. 62 female, X 2 test, p-value < 0.01), as expected under a null hypothesis of equal transmission risk (Fig. 4a ,b,d, see also reference (11, 12) , Materials and Methods) and the median age in this group increased to 46 (50% interquartile interval: 34.25 -58, t-test: p-value < 0.01) (Figs. 4a,b,c, Fig. S7 ). We hypothesize that many of the cases with no known travel history in the early period were indeed travelers that contributed to disseminating SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan. The shift towards more equal sex ratios and older ages in non-travellers after 31 st January 2020 confirm the finding that epidemics outside Wuhan were then driven by local transmission dynamics. The case definition changed to include cases without travel history to Wuhan after 23 th January 2020 (Materials and Methods).",

The three models were compared using differences in Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), where larger values indicate models with lower relative support, and BIC>4 considered the cutoff for substantial model improvement. We performed a detailed sensitivity analysis on the availability of PCR tests, doubling time, and incubation periods. We obtained qualitatively similar results for Model 1 (Poisson GLM fit to daily case counts), Model 2 (negative binomial GLM fit to daily case counts ), and Model 3 (log-linear regressions fit to cumulative cases), see Table S2 . In addition, we provide a full time series analysis of the optimal lag structure for cases and mobility for each province. Additionally, although BIC is considered more conservative, model selection results were confirmed using AIC for model selection (see Fig. 4 and Table S2 ). Lastly, we validated our model selection results using elastic-net regression and n-fold cross validation as implemented in the R package GLMNET (11, 12. Estimating epidemic doubling time: To estimate the epidemic doubling time across each province, we fit a mixed effects Poisson GLM of daily case counts to days since the first case report in each province (fixed effect) and a random effect for each province on the slope and intercept, using the R package lme4 v.1.1-21 (35) . Daily case counts were determined using the date of symptom onset. However, we only have a symptom onset date for 667 cases. Where the date of symptom onset was not available, we .

Briefly, we forecast the cumulative number of cases in each Chinese province by simply doubling the number of cumulative cases reported six days prior. For dates prior to Jan. 28th and after Feb 3rd, this naive forecast produces an accurate estimate of the cumulative number of cases in each province (Fig. S4) . However, the cumulative number of cases reported on Jan 28th is poorly estimated using this model (Fig. S4) . In order to accurately forecast the number of cases on Jan 28th, we must also include the relative amount of mobility out of Wuhan into various provinces in the regression model. In Fig. S4 , we show how a model including only movement from Wuhan on January 22nd fit to the residuals from Fig. S4 is once again .

Foreigners living in Wuhan were categorized as Wuhan and patients with missing Wuhan residency were either kept as missing values or categorized according to their country of origin.

The out-of-sample log likelihood for the regularized Poisson regression was -9102 and was -22519 for the negative binomial model. The significantly worse fit for the negative binomial model was primarily driven by two outlier predictions, removing those results in an out-of-sample log likelihood for the negative binomial model of -11625. Models were implemented in the R package glmnet v. 2.0-18 (36). Because glmnet has not implemented a negative binomial model, we performed regularization using the Poisson model and estimated the overdispersion parameter using the glm.nb function in the R package MASS v. 7.3-51.4 (37).",
