NEURO-BIOL AGING 12(6) 669-672, 1991.--Characterization of the microbiological status is an important facet of a quality assurance program for laboratory animals. This paper addresses basic issues with regard to standardization of the characterization of murine viral status. Methods for such characterization include clinical signs, virus isolation, and serological tests. Significant considerations are screening profiles; sample collection, processing, and shipment; and sampling schedules. International standardization of programs and methods to control and characterize the microbiological status of laboratory animals is being developed, and will be highly significant in future efforts to produce, control, and maintain laboratory animals free of viral infections.",

There is abundant evidence that these agents interfere with a wide diversity of studies, both short-as well as longterm (including aging studies). The loss of breeding production in rodent colonies or loss of the entire colony by overt disease is disruptive to research, and it is relatively easy to persuade an investigator of the usefulness of using virus-free animals after the experience of an overt disease in his colony. However, it is a common characteristic, especially of viral infections in colonies of laboratory animals, that pathogens may persist in a colony without causing any clinical or pathological symptom. This may make results from research less reliable, a point that is frequently overlooked by the investigator. Thus quality biomedical studies of aging are not only dependent on the use of diseasefree animals but also on animals free from latent infections.",

Today, we are measuring more subtle changes in specific functions of specialized rodent cells or rodent organ systems. (C) New legislation for controlling the safety of biological products with respect to the hazards of viral contaminants has been introduced by government agencies. There is an increasing application of preparations derived from laboratory animals for diagnostic and therapeutic use in humans.

The major disadvantages of the serological test are that unknown viruses will not be detected and for certain viruses there is no serological test available (e.g., lactic dehydrogenase elevating virus, LDV).

The ELISA is technically easy to perform and is more sensitive than CF and HAI.

The sample size is independent of the size of the population if the population is at least 100 or more animals. In short, given an expected percent of infection in a population, and assuming that the screening procedure is 100% accurate, Table 5 shows a sample size that will give at least one positive reaction with a normally acceptable confidence limit (>0.95). If, for example, an infection rate of 30% is expected, then 9 samples should be taken. If multiple agents are screened, the lowest expected morbidity rate should be used.",
