            "text": "To predict where diseases might spread, it is necessary to understand their epidemiology in the regions in which they have been historically recorded. First, we must identify the pieces of the puzzle -the pathogen, its vertebrate hosts and the routes of transmission between hosts. Second, the patterns of each disease must be recorded -both the distribution in space and changes with time. An essential part of this second step is an appreciation of the environment in which transmission is taking place. Third, we need to understand the dynamic processes of transmission that ultimately determine the patterns that are observed. Given this baseline knowledge, we might finally be able to estimate the likelihood of pathogen spread to, and establishment in, new areas. Diagnosis. The first task is essentially one of diagnosis, a task that is not always simple in complex natural biological systems. Identifying the pieces of the puzzle can lead to an expectation of the resulting patterns, but it can be difficult to anticipate the number of important pieces that are involved. For example, it might have been expected that West Nile virus in North America would be transmitted by only a few native American mosquito species (the vectors). A pathogen in a new continent is unlikely to find many competent vectors, and many flaviviruses (the family to which West Nile virus belongs) typically have only one West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome and monkeypox are infectious diseases that have recently been introduced into areas far from their region of origin. The greatest risk of new diseases comes from zoonoses -pathogens that circulate among wild animals and are occasionally transferred to humans by intermediate invertebrate hosts or vectors that are sensitive to climatic conditions. Analytical tools that are based on geographical information systems and that can incorporate remotely sensed information about the environment offer the potential to define the limiting conditions for any disease in its native region for which there are at least some distribution data. The direction, intensity or likelihood of its spread to new regions could then be predicted, potentially allowing disease early-warning systems to be developed. Monkeypox, which is related to smallpox, is known historically only in Africa, but was P E R S P E C T I V E S Whilst the database origins allow all the usual calculations of summary or averaged data, the geographical essence of GISs allows them to be used to reveal the spatiotemporal structure of disease cases. For example, disease clusters -the geographical co-occurrence of cases that indicates local transmission of infectious diseases or the presence of environmental determinants of non-infectious diseases -are common. Childhood arthritis is not traditionally thought of as infectious, but the recognition of a cluster of cases in Old Lyme, Connecticut in the late 1970s 11 (albeit without the benefit of a GIS) ultimately led to the discovery of tick-borne Lyme borreliosis 12 , the most widespread and prevalent vector-borne infection in the northern temperate world.",

Environmental conditions might also be important for any directly transmitted (for example, host-to-host) pathogens that must survive for any period of time outside the host. Bovine tuberculosis outbreaks in cattle herds are thought by many to be caused by contamination from infected wild animals, and high-risk areas have been predicted accurately using seasonal features of atmospheric humidity and air temperature 15 .

The ability of GISs to produce spatial resolution), but the result is large volumes of data, which often show strong serial correlations that affect the power of statistical analyses. To reduce the volume of data and remove these serial correlations without losing the biologically meaningful signals, a technique of time-series analysis that was invented by the French mathematician Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) is used. Fourier solved a problem in calculus that had defeated Newton and subsequent generations of mathematicians, by showing that a complex time series can always be expressed as the sum of a series of sine curves with different amplitudes, frequencies and phases (that is, timings) around a characteristic mean. Using Fourier's techniques, therefore, it is possible to extract information about the annual, bi-annual and tri-annual cycles of rainfall, temperature and other parameters that characterize the natural environments of diseases from the multi-temporal satellite data (FIG. 1) (it is this shift from the time to the frequency domain that removes the serial correlation in the satellite data). The output of temporal Fourier analysis is a set of orthogonal (that is, uncorrelated) variables that capture the seasonality that is of interest in epidemiology 6, 13, 16 , and these variables can therefore be used to classify habitats and describe vector and pathogen distributions. For disease systems, Fourier variables are the environmental equivalent of the genes of individual pathogens, and whole Fourier-processed images (FIG. 2) that capture all the interactive space-time features of a habitat can be likened to the organismal genome.",

These models capture details of pathogen transmission in a series of mathematical equations that describe the birth and death of organisms, and transmission processes, directly. The same remotely sensed data that are used to describe the patterns of infection in statistical models can also be used to explain transmission in biological models. For example, satellite data have been correlated with key behavioural or demographic rates of the vectors (FIG. 4a) of indirectly transmitted diseases, thereby identifying the conditions that are best for pathogen transmission. A model of a tsetse-fly population, which is driven by satellite-derived variables, captures 93% of the observed seasonal pattern (FIG. 4b) . Given the extra layers of complexity that are involved in pathogen transmission by vectors, it is not surprising that the model of trypanosomiasis seasonal prevalence, which is driven, in turn, by this tsetse model, gives a less good fit (62%) to the disease data (FIG. 4b) . In this case, the model assumed that cattle supply only 30% of the blood meals for the tsetse, but are the only significant source of trypanosome infections for the flies, when in reality wildlife species also play a part in transmission 22 . This emphasizes our first point -the importance of identifying all the pieces of the puzzle before we can make reliable predictions. The persistence of an infectious agent can also be predicted from the widely used R 0 equation, which arises from rearranging the transmission equations to determine whether, at very low prevalence in an entirely susceptible population, an infection will increase or decline to extinction 23 . Given that six out of the seven parameters and variables of the R 0 equation for vectorborne pathogens are determined not by the vertebrate host but by the vector 24 , which is highly susceptible to climatic influences, it is possible to produce R 0 maps for vectorborne diseases using satellite imagery; however, the first attempts have not yet been validated. A map describing the relative transmission risk of the directly transmitted foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom revealed considerable spatial heterogeneity 25 , but the mapping was not based on any environmental variables that might Longer-term changes. With historical, georeferenced disease records over several (preferably many) years, time-series analysis can be applied to make predictions about the future of the disease. Long-term records of disease are relatively rare, and usually apply to point or small-area locations. The problem with statistical approaches (for example, various auto-regressive techniques) to these types of data is that they assume that the transmission dynamics of disease in the future will be similar to those of the past. In reality, pathogen-host systems are always evolving and their environments are changing, which multiple, derived layers of data often compounds any errors that are present in each contributory variable. This is especially likely when no attempt is made to verify these derived layers through field observations (for example, checking vegetation classifications that are based on satellite data), and the effects are especially severe when the errors are systematic. The production of visually appealing, even statistically sound, results that do not reveal anything useful about either pattern or process is perhaps the greatest danger facing newcomers to this powerful technology. tropical) areas of the world 33 , and the second is a consequence of the computing requirements of global circulation models 34 . We can do little about the historical climatic data sets, and computing power is not predicted to increase sufficiently rapidly to address the second problem in the near future. Climatically speaking, we know neither where we are coming from, nor where we are headed, with anything like the precision that is required to predict spatially variable, climatically sensitive diseases.",

The consequent increasingly urgent need to develop global disease early-warning systems (DEWS) is fortunately matched by rapidly developing tools: RS imagery within a GIS now offers greater power for describing, explaining and predicting epidemiological phenomena than ever before. Furthermore, although global routes of infection are increasingly common, global information flow has increased in parallel, thanks to the internet, and information can be transmitted even faster than any pathogen. In the most recent example, once the international community became aware of SARS, the response in laboratories and health agencies help explain this spatial pattern. A map of fully parameterized R 0 values would show potential sources (R 0 \u2265 1) and sinks (R 0 <1) of infection, and would be of obvious benefit to control efforts, because only sources of infection require control, and only to levels where they also become sinks.",

As there are so few global disease data sets, we are generally forced to use one or other statistical approach to disease mapping. Climatic similarities between areas that are, at present, diseaseaffected and disease-free, can be used as a guide to the environmental permissiveness of these latter areas for the diseases in question. Like risk mapping, however, climate matching is a probabilistic exercise; similarity of climates does not guarantee similarity of diseases, but simply makes it more likely, all other things being equal. The present-day match of the UK climate to global climates (FIG. 5) indicates that UK inhabitants might expect to share climatically determined diseases not just with parts of mainland Europe, but also with China and North America. Given suitable connections by trade or travel 26 , if only one of these climatically matched regions is a source of emergence of any new disease -as China is for new strains of influenza -all of these regions could potentially suffer from it.",

Similar techniques can be applied in the spatial domain to satellite imagery. The enormous range of pixel sizes that are available in commercial satellite imagery (from 0.6 m to >1 km) challenges us to develop methods to identify the appropriate data resolutions, and to integrate these data into spatial units that are relevant to disease transmission, such as the movement range of an infected individual for a directly transmitted pathogen, or the flight range of an insect for a vector-borne pathogen. Again, wavelet and other techniques might help here, by enabling us to look at the environment from the perspective of disease systems that are driven more by biological realism than by technological wizardry. A unified space-time theory of epidemics, in which a three-dimensional space-time pixel replaces a two-dimensional one as the basic recording unit, is still some way off 38 , but GIS and RS technologies are the vehicles that, potentially, will get us there the fastest.

By contrast, however, although the response to the introduction of West Nile virus in the United States was equally impressive (a delay of less than 2 months between the first (unrecognized) human case in New York and identification of the virus), the spread of this disease has not been stopped, and it must now be regarded as endemic throughout much of the United States. The differences between these two diseases can be attributed to many factors, but all will be embedded within one or other parameter or variable of the transmission and R 0 equations. Finally, we highlight two key issues in epidemic disease prediction that have pervaded this review -space and time. Although epidemiological surveillance networks, or global satellite systems, constrain the collection of data to particular intervals of time (the reporting period) or space (the pixel size), diseases do not respect such artificial units. We must develop methods that allow us to move seamlessly across scales of time and space as we analyse epidemics that occur throughout the spectrum from small isolated communities to the global population. Classical time-series analysis of disease data, or Fourier analyses of temporal satellite series, assume a constancy (mathematical stationarity) in the disease system or the environment that is rarely shown in practice.

During the past decade, the search for an effective system for the selective delivery of high therapeutic doses of anti-cancer agents to tumours has explored a variety of ingenious and increasingly complex biological systems. These systems are most often based on gene therapy and use viral vectors as the delivery vehicle. Invariably, such systems have been found wanting with respect to a lack of tumour specificity, poor levels of transgene expression and inefficient distribution of the vector throughout the tumour mass. By contrast, the ability of intravenously injected clostridial spores to infiltrate, then selectively germinate in, the hypoxic regions of solid tumours seems to be a totally natural phenomenon, which requires no fundamental alterations and is exquisitely specific.",

There are, however, many tumours and circumstances where these approaches are ineffective. Consequently, there is intensive activity around the world to develop alternative approaches. A fundamental requirement of any new anti-cancer therapy is the facility to subject tumour cells to a toxic agent and at the same time exclude normal healthy tissues from such exposure. Despite their conceptual simplicity, the derivation of such therapies is proving extremely challenging.Over the past two decades, a significant amount of effort has focused on attempting to localize protein-based anti-cancer agents specifically to the site of tumours. The resulting therapeutic effect is dependent on the class of protein that is used. These range from proteins that, to a certain extent, have a direct effect (for example, immunogens, toxins and cytokines), to enzymes that are able to generate a cytotoxic drug from an innocuous precursor, such as prodrug-converting enzymes.In all cases, these agents have been shown to be highly effective in killing tumour cells in studies using appropriate cell lines. The challenge has been to bring about their selective delivery to the tumour. Initially, strategies were devised that sought to target the protein itself, most prominently through its fusion to",
