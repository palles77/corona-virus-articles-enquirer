            "text": "Various fluorodeoxyribonucleosides were evaluated for their antiviral activities against influenza virus infections in vitro and in vivo. Among the most potent inhibitors was 2'-deoxy-2'fluorocytidine (2'-FdC). It inhibited various strains of low and highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses, pandemic H1N1 viruses, an oseltamivir-resistant pandemic H1N1 virus, and seasonal influenza viruses (H3N2, H1N1, influenza B) in MDCK cells, with the 90% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.13 \u00b5M to 4.6 \u00b5M, as determined by a virus yield reduction assay. 2'-FdC was then tested for efficacy in BALB/c mice infected with a lethal dose of highly pathogenic influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 virus. 2'FdC (60 mg/kg/d) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice a day beginning 24 h after virus exposure significantly promoted survival (80% survival) of infected mice (p=0.0001). Equally efficacious were the treatment regimens in which mice were treated with 2'-FdC at 30 or 60 mg/kg/day (bid \u00d7 8) beginning 24 h before virus exposure. At these doses, 70-80% of the mice were protected from death due to virus infection (p=0.0005, p=0.0001; respectively). The lungs harvested from treated mice at day four of the infection displayed little surface pathology or histopathology, lung weights were lower, and the 60 mg/kg dose reduced lung virus titers, although not significantly compared to the placebo controls. All doses were well tolerated in uninfected mice. 2'-FdC could also be administered as late as 72 h post virus exposure and still significantly protect 60% mice from the lethal effects of the H5N1 virus infection (p=0.019). Other fluorodeoxyribonucleosides tested in the H5N1 mouse model, 2'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine and 2'-deoxy-2', 2'-difluorocytidine, were very toxic at higher doses and not inhibitory at lower doses. Finally, 2'-FdC, which was active in the H5N1 mouse model, was also active in a pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection model in mice. When given at 30 mg/kg/d (bid \u00d7 5) beginning 24 h before virus exposure), 2'-FdC also significantly enhanced survival of H1N1-infected mice (50%, p=0.038) similar to the results obtained in the H5N1 infection model using a similar dosing regimen (50%, p<0.05). Given the demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of avian influenza virus replication, 2'FdC may qualify as a lead compound for the development of agents treating influenza virus infections.",

Human influenza causes a variety of infections ranging from acute lower respiratory disease that can culminate in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to a mild, self-limiting febrile illness (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/facts.htm). Seasonal influenza A and pandemic H1N1 influenza A viruses have the potential to cause pandemic disease that periodically has been associated with high mortality rates. In addition, there is great concern that highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses that infect and cause inordinate amount of lethal disease in humans could evolve to pose a pandemic risk (Kwon et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Usually, \"avian influenza virus\" refers to influenza A viruses causing severe, epidemic infections in birds, although the severe and lethal infections with these viruses can occur in humans. The risk of infection for humans from these highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses is generally low because the viruses are not readily transmissable to humans from birds or from infected to uninfected humans (Kwon et al., 2011) . However, the virus can be very lethal in humans with mortality rates approaching 50% (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/en/), thus making this a virus of extreme concern. The H5N1 viruses are endemic in Asia and have spread into Europe and America (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/en/). Human H5N1 influenza infection was first recognized in 1997 when this virus infected 18 people in Hong Kong, causing 6 deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1997; 1998a; 1998b; 1998c; Claas et al., 1998; Suarez et al., 1998) . Almost all cases of avian influenza infection in humans have resulted from contact with infected chickens or ducks or surfaces contaminated with secretion/excretions from infected birds (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/facts.htm). Up to 16 March 2011, more than 534 human H5N1 cases have been diagnosed around the world and more than half of those infected have died as a result of the virus (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/en/). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) anticipate that there will be more cases, more hospitalizations and more deaths associated with this virus because the population has little to no effective protective immunity against these virus strains (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/facts.htm).",

In addition, vaccines that are specific for newly arising strains require several months of preparation, and although the development of a vaccine against H5N1 influenza has been under way for a number of years, none is yet approved for use in the United States (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/facts.htm).

The M2 ion channel inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine and the influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir (Preziosi, 2011) . Some studies have indicated that many of the avian influenza H5N1 viruses are resistant to both amantadine and rimantadine (Trampuz et al., 2004) , with the viruses having an M gene containing mutations associated with this resistance (Puthavathana et al., 2005) . Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is a widely used, effective treatment for all strains of influenza. In addition, i.v.-administered peramivir has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for emergency use (Hernandez et al., 2011) . It is orally administered to directly target the site of infection, the respiratory tract. However, of the existing antiviral drugs, only oseltamivir and zanamivir seem to inhibit the avian H5N1 viruses, although the inhibition in some cases is modest and there is the concern of development of resistance if these two drugs were routinely used to treat H5N1 infections (Govorkova et al., 2001; Leneva et al., 2000; Naughtin et al., 2011) . Therefore, there is a great need to develop easily synthesizable, alternative potent antiinfluenza drugs to combat human disease caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses (HPAIV) and to address the potential need to treat newly emerging drugresistant strains of influenza viruses (Aoki et al., 2007; Thorlund et al., 2011; Ujike et al., 2011) . In this regard, a promising experimental anti-influenza drug, favipiravir (6-fluoro-3hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide, T-705) has been shown to inhibit a variety of influenza viruses, including HPAIV (Furuta et al., 2002; Sidwell et al., 2007) .",

A series of 2'-fluororibosides were evaluated for anti-influenza activity in cell culture and in a mouse pneumonia model Tuttle et al., 1993) . Many were found to be inhibitors of influenza A. Of the compounds tested in MDCK cells, 2'-deoxy-2'fluoroguanosine and 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocytosine were the most potent inhibitors of influenza virus replication with EC 50 values of 18.2 and 2.6 \u00b5M, respectively. 2'-deoxy-2'fluoroguanosine was a more potent inhibitor of influenza virus replication in chicken embryo fibroblasts and both compounds were found to be equally inhibitory for influenza virus replication in human tracheal cultures. 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine was found to be broad-spectrum in vitro inhibitor of influenza viruses, inhibiting influenza AH1N1, H2N2, H3N2, and influenza B viruses nearly equally. 2'-Deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine was found to selectively inhibit the influenza transcriptase complex and was less inhibitory to transcriptase complexes isolated from 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine partially resistant influenza virus (Tisdale et al., 1995) In another study, it was shown that the differences of in vitro anti-influenza virus activity of twenty purine fluororibonucleosides was based on the amount of nucleoside triphosphates of each compound that was generated in MDCK cells and CEF cells . In vivo, 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine (40 mg/kg) delivered orally at 0.5, 4 and 20 h after virus exposure was shown to reduce lung virus titers at 24 after treatment more effectively than amantadine or ribavirin and to protect 50% of mice from death when administered subcutaneously twice a day for 5 days beginning 4 h prior to exposure to virus. . In that same study, 2'FdC had in vitro activity, but did not reduce virus lung titers in the mouse model at 24-48 h post virus exposure. In ferrets, 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine at 20 mg/kg given 1 h after virus exposure reduced virus replication in the lungs, amelioration of fever, and nasal inflammation (Jakeman et al., 1994) . Thus, 2'-fluororibosides may warrant further evaluation of influenza virus inhibition in vitro and in vivo, especially against highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses such as the H5N1 strains.",

NA proteins, but with a replication core from the cold-adapted Ann Arbor H1N1 virus, which contains the PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS gene segments of the latter virus generated by the use of reverse genetics. The HA gene was genetically modified to remove the stretch of basic amino acids connecting the HA1 and HA2 domains of HA, as described by Suguitan et al. (2006) . A/Influenza A/Sydney/05/97 (H3N2), A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2), influenza A/CA/07/2009 (H1N1) viruses and A/Hong Kong/2369/2009 (H1N1) virus with the NA 274Y mutation for oseltamivir resistance were from CDC (Chen et al., 2009) . The influenza B viruses, B/Malaysia/2506/2004 and B/Florida/4/2006, were received from CDC. All the viruses used in cell culture experiments were passaged through Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) at least once to prepare pools. The pools were then titrated in MDCK cells before use. The cells were grown in MEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) and 0.18% sodium bicarbonate with no antibiotics in a 5% CO 2 incubator. Viral propagation and assays were done in MDCK cells in MEM, 0.18% sodium bicarbonate, 10 units of trypsin/ml, and 1.0 \u00b5g EDTA/ml. A novel mouse adapted H1N1 strain was originally obtained from Elena Govorkova (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). It has been designated as influenza A/ CA/04/09 pandemic H1N1 virus (SJ#175190) and was adapted to mice by Natalia A. Ilyushina (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). The influenza A/CA/04/09 strain used in this study was first passaged in MDCK cells and then grown in embryonated chicken eggs. It was adapted to mice by 9 sequential passages through mouse lungs. The virus from the last lung passage was then plaque purified in MDCK cells and amplified in embryonated chicken eggs. The virus was amplified in MDCK cells to prepare stocks for mouse studies. Mice were exposed to 3 LD 50 (10 3.39 PFU) of virus by the intranasal (i.n.) route.",

These methods have been described previously . Cytopathic effect observations measure virus effects on cell morphology, which may or may not reflect physiological changes in the cell induced by virus infection. Neutral red is a vital dye, which stains functioning lysosomes and thus reflects the over all physiological status of the cell, and virus yield reduction assay measures the effects of a compound on the amount of virus released from a cell. Thus, one could expect a compound may have profound effect on one of the parameters measured, but not one of the other parameters measured that are described above. Eight one-half log 10 concentrations of the test compounds were evaluated in triplicate wells containing influenza virus-MDCK cells. Standard placebo-treated virus controls, toxicity controls, and normal-medium controls were included in all assays.

For certain experiments, five mice from each group were sacrificed on day 4 after virus exposure. Each mouse lung was collected and homogenized for virus titer determination. The samples were assayed in triplicate in MDCK cells by cytopathic effect assay, and the 50% cell culture infectious dose values calculated. Parameters for determining the effects of treatment included the prevention of death through 21 days, inhibition of lung consolidation (lung score and lung weight), and lessening of lung virus titers. Toxicity controls, consisting of three mice for each compound concentration tested, were evaluated daily for weight loss and adverse events such as ruffling of fur, lethargy, paralysis, incontinence, repetitive circular motion, and aggression.",

This inhibition was independent of cell cytotoxicity; the SI values for this compound ranged from 251-1954.

SI values ranged from >535 to >1100. This inhibitory activity was confirmed by virus yield reduction assays with an IC 90 calculated to be equal to 0.13 \u00b5M.

The Hong Kong/213/2003 and Vietnam/1203/2004 viruses were modestly inhibited by 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine (Figure 1 ) with IC 50 values ranging from 8.5-21 \u00b5M, but this activity was only slightly selective for virus inhibition when tested up to a concentration of 100 \u00b5M. The Thailand/2/(KAN1)/16/2004 virus was not inhibited by the compound. 2-Deoxy-2'-fluoroadenosine ( Figure 1 ) and 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine (Figure 1 ) essentially did not inhibit any of the H5N1 viruses. 2'-azido-2'-deoxyctidine-5'-triphosphate exhibited the same strain specific inhibition that was demonstrated for 5'-FdC; it only inhibited the A/Vietnam1203/2004 virus and not the other two strains. We assume that in order to enter cells, 2'-azido-2'-deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate will dephosphorylate and become 2'-azido-2'-deoxycytidine.

This was done by anesthetizing the mice by i.p. injection of ketamine (100/mg/kg) and instilling 50 \u00b5l of 10 3.5 CCID 50 /ml virus into the nares. The mice were then treated p.o. or i.p. with a total of 0.3, 3.0, and 30 mg/kg of 2'FdC per day twice a day for 8 days or with 75 mg/kg/day of ribavirin twice a day for 8 days beginning 24 h before virus exposure. As controls, 15 infected mice were treated p.o. with water or i.p. with PSS in parallel with 2'deoxy-2'-fluorocytidine. Of the placebo-treated mice receiving the calculated LD 90 dose 90% died as expected (Figs. 2A, p.o. administration and 2A, i.p. administration). H5N1 influenza virus-infected mice treated with any dose of 2'-FdC by the per os route of administration were not protected from mortality due to the virus infection ( Fig. 2A) , although ribavirin treatment delivered per os at 75 mg/kg/d did significantly protect mice from death (p<0.01). This lack of protection against death in mice treated with 2'-FdC by the per os route correlated with the data showing that the per os delivered 2'-FdC treatments did not ameliorate weight loss either (Fig. 2B) . On the other hand, ribavirin-treated mice, the majority of which survived the effects of the virus infection, lost much less weight. In contrast to the data from mice treated by the p.o. route, H5N1 virus-infected mice treated with 2'-FdC at 30 mg/kg/day or ribavirin at 75 mg/kg/d by the i.p. route were partially, but significantly protected from death compared to infected mice receiving the placebo by the i.p. route (Fig. 3A, P<0 .05). The protection from death was also significant for mice treated with ribavirin by the p.o. route (p<0.01). Mice receiving these treatments did lose less weight than mice treated with placebo (Fig. 3A) . Surviving mice, including those receiving ribavirin or 2'FdC went on to gain weight by the end of the experiment that was nearly equal to the original body weight recorded at the initiation of the study (Fig. 3B) .",

            "text": "In a follow-up study, mice were administered a higher dose of 2'-FdC (60 mg/kg), using the same i.p. treatment regimen described previously. As shown before, the 30 mg/kg dose significantly protected mice against death, with 70% of the treated mice surviving in this experiment (Fig. 4) , which was similarly efficacious as compared to the 60mg/kg dose, suggesting that the maximal protective effect was achieved at the 30mg/kg dose. 80% of the mice survived the infection when treated with 60 mg/kg/d of 2'-FdC. At this higher dose little toxicity was observed with the exception of a tendency of a little more weight loss (data not shown). Virus lung titers at day 4 post infection were somewhat lower in mice receiving the 60 mg/kg/d treatment compared to the mice receiving placebo or the 30 mg/kg/ 2'-FdC (Table 4 ), although this difference was not statistically significant. Ribavirin treatment resulted in a significant reduction of almost 1000-fold in virus titer (p<0.01) compared to the lung virus titers from placebo-treated mice. The gross pathology was very mild at day 4 in all mice, yet there was some lessening of lung weights (presumably a reflection of less lung edema) in mice treated with 2'-FdC at 60 mg/kg/d and a significant reduction in lung weights for mice treated with 30 mg/kg/d 2'-FdC or ribavirin at 75 mg/kg/d (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Microscopic inspection of lung tissue (day 4 after virus exposure) after histological staining revealed little or no pathogenesis, as would be expected early in this infection even though peak virus lung titers were attained at this time of the infection (Sidwell et al., 2005) . In a subsequent experiment, it was found that there were no additional benefits of treating with 80 mg/kg/d of 2'-FdC; on the contrary that dose was detrimental to weight recovery by the mice and only 40% of mice survived the infection (data not shown). Thus, the 60 mg/kg/d dose of 2'-FdC given bid \u00d7 8 was the most effective dosing regimen in protecting mice against death due to virus infection and appeared to be the maximum tolerated effective dose.",

            "text": "The next experiment was to determine if efficacy could be achieved with less frequent or more frequent dosing with 2'-FdC. Groups of 10 mice were administered 2'-FdC i.p. at 60 or 30 mg/kg/day i.p. for 8 days (bid, tid or qd \u00d7 8) beginning at 24 h before virus exposure. In addition, some mice were treated with 60 mg/kg/d of 2'-FdC i.p. bid \u00d7 8 beginning at various times post virus exposure. For this experiment, 90% of the placebo-treated mice receiving the calculated LD 90 dose died as expected (Fig. 5) . A number of the dosing regimens provided significant protection from death as compared to vehicle, although there were no significant differences between the treatment regimens. 2'FdC at 60 mg/kg/day given twice a day for 8 days, beginning 24 h after virus exposure was the regimen which had the greatest number of mice surviving the infection (p=0.0001, Fig. 5 ; Table 5 , live per/total ratio, p<0.05). It appeared that this treatment not only promoted total survival, but also indicated that the mice in this treatment group were 10-fold less likely to die than mice treated with placebo (Table 5 , hazard ratio = 10.6). In addition, treating infected mice with 2'-FdC at 72 h post virus exposure significantly protected 60% of mice from the lethal effects of virus challenge (p= 0.0191) and a hazard ratio of 4.04. Treatment with drug administered 48 h after infection prolonged the day of death to the point that day 16 after virus exposure (Table 5 , mean and median days of death) was the day on which the largest number of mice died (see median day of death) but did not significantly protect mice against death (p >0.05). Other treatment regimens evaluated were designed to examine the effects of varying the frequency of treatment beginning treatment at \u221224 h and then bid \u00d7 8 days, but providing the mice with the same total doses per day that were previously shown to provide protection. For example, the treatment regimen which involved administering 2'FdC at 60 mg/kg/day once a day for 8 days was significantly efficacious for protecting mice from the lethality of the virus infection (p=0.0048). In contrast, 30mg/kg given once a day did not afford mice significant protection against death compared to mice in the vehicle control group, despite reaching 50% protection (p>0.05). However, mice receiving the dosing regimens involving administration of drug three times a day were significantly protected against death regardless of the dose of 2'-FdC used (60 mg/kg, p=0.0005; 30 mg/kg, p= 0.0005). These latter treatment regimens were as effective as treating with 2'FdC at 60 mg/ kg/day given twice a day for 8 days.",

In addition, adding another fluoro group to the 2' position of the sugar to get 2'-deoxy-2', 2'-difluorocytidine (gemcitabine) also greatly enhanced the potency against the influenza viruses (Table 3) , although in some assays gemcitabine was cytotoxic. Thus, evaluation of 5-FdC and gemcitabine was carried out by infecting groups of mice i.n. with a 100% lethal dose of highly pathogenic influenza A H5N1 virus infection. Treatment for each compound was by the i.p. route, since this route of administration was found to be the most efficacious way of delivering 2'-FdC. For 5-FdC, the mice were treated i.p. with 2'deoxy-5-fluorocytidine at 60, 30, and 3.0 mg/kg/d in 0.4% CMC twice a day for 8 days beginning 24 h before virus exposure. As controls, the infected mice were treated i.p. with 0.4% CMC in parallel with 2'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine. H5N1 influenza virus-infected mice receiving 5-FdC by the i.p. route were not shielded from death compared to infected mice receiving 0.4% CMC (Fig. 6A ). Mice treated with the 60 and 30 mg/kg doses died in greater numbers than did untreated mice (p<0.0001). In fact, in untreated mice there was considerable toxicity in the form of severe weight loss at the 30 and 60 mg/kg/d doses and some deaths (data not shown). The 3.0 mg/kg dose, although well-tolerated, was not very effective in promoting survival of infected mice suggesting this structure enhanced toxicity and while lowering efficacy compared to 2'-FdC.",

            "text": "In this report, we have demonstrated that 2'FdC was inhibitory to a broad spectrum of influenza A and influenza B viruses, including three strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in MDCK cells, with the 90% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.69 \u00b5M to 7.3 \u00b5M, as determined by a virus yield reduction assay (Tables 1 and 3) . We found that selected substitutions on the sugar moiety of the cytidine nucleoside, specifically the addition of a second fluoro group at the 2' position or moving the fluoro group to the 5 position of the nucleoside enhanced the potency of inhibition of influenza viruses in vitro, although adding the second fluoro group to the 2' position might have resulted in increased cytotoxicity in some in vitro assays that were done. Overall, gemcitabine appeared to be a slightly more potent inhibitor of influenza A virus replication as assessed by virus yield reduction assay (IC 90 values = 0.03-1.7 \u00b5M) than 2'-FdC (IC 90 values = 1.2-7.3 \u00b5M), although there was cytotoxicity detected in some assays when using gemcitabine. Other fluorodeoxyribonucleosides were either not inhibitory to the influenza viruses or marginally active (guanosine fluorodeoxynucleoside). In a much earlier report, 2'-deoxy-2'fluoroguanosine and 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocytosine were shown to be the most potent inhibitors of influenza virus replication with EC 50 values of 18.2 and 2.6 \u00b5M, respectively. In that study 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine was a more potent inhibitor of influenza virus replication in chicken embryo fibroblasts, but 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocytodine was totally inactive . Both compounds were found to be equally inhibitory of influenza virus replication in human tracheal cultures Jakeman et al., 1994) . Based on the efficacy data from CEF cells, the investigators reporting the earlier study chose to pursue the 2'-deoxy-2'fluoroguanosine ribonucleoside for animal testing. Our data support some of these previous findings. We found that 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoroguanosine and 2'FdC inhibited influenza A highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza species in CPE reduction assays (4-5 day duration) in MDCK cells (IC 50 = 8.5-21 \u00b5M, 0.05-8 \u00b5M, respectively) as potently as the two compounds inhibited the H1N1 virus in the previous study in which plaque reduction assays (2 day duration)) in MDCK cells (IC50 = 18uM, 2.6 \u00b5M, respectively) were used, with 2'FdC being the more potent of the two compounds in MDCK cells in that study. In both our study and the study done by Tisdale et al. (1993) , both compounds were relatively non-toxic. In the current study as well as in the study by Tisdale et al. (1993) , 2'-deoxy-2'fluoroadenosine was not active. In the previous study, the higher IC 50 value for 2'-deoxy-2'fluoroguanosine (2'-FdG) in MDCK cells was shown to be due the rate limiting step of triphosphate formation in MDCK cells. Interestingly, other guanosine nucleoside-like analogs such as favipiravir and ribavirin that inhibit influenza viruses and perhaps the virus transcriptase complex seem likely to be phosphorylated to the triphosphate form quite well in MDCK cells (Furuta et al., 2005) .",

Because 2'-FdC may assume a 3\u2032-endo conformation and thus act as a ribonucleoside, 2'-FdC may actually act as a substrate for the influenza RNA polymerase complex. 2'-FdG-triphosphate has already been demonstrated to be a substrate and inhibitor of influenza polymerase (Tisdale et al., 1995) . 2'-FdC may also inhibit other RNA polymerases. Shi et al. reported that 2'-FdC may also act as a substrate for the HCV RNA polymerase and that the 2' fluoro group is the group that is actually recognized by the HCV polymerase (Shi et al., 2005) .

The lack of protection and toxicity at high doses of 2'FdC may be due to inhibition of host DNA polymerases (Richardson et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "We further examined the efficacy of 2'FdC in a BALB/c mouse model infected with a lethal dose of highly pathogenic influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 virus. The dosing regimen of 60 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally 24 h after virus exposure twice a day for eight days resulted in an 80% survival rate and some reduction in virus lung titers and probably in edema of the lungs associated with the virus pathogenesis. Using 2'-FdC at 30 mg/kg/d was nearly as effective as the higher dose of 2'FdC, but neither dose reduced virus lung titers comparable to those virus titers from lungs of mice treated with ribavirin. This could suggest that immunomodulation, as discussed above, may have contributed to the efficacy of 2'-FdC in facilitating the survival of influenza-infected mice. Other regimens of almost equal efficacy in significantly inhibiting mortality of mice due to virus infection included dosing 24 h prior to virus exposure (bid \u00d7 8). Parceling the 60 mg/kg/d dose out as three equal doses over a period of 12 hours (tid \u00d7 8) was also very efficacious. Even a single dose at 60 mg/kg given over a period of 8 days significantly protected mice against death due to virus infection compared to placebo-treated mice. The inherent variability in this experiment is apparent from the treatment group starting 72h post infection providing numerically better protection against death compared to the number of deaths in the treatment group receiving compound starting at 48h post infection. In summary, the data suggests that 30 and 60mg/kg dosing regimens provide similar levels of protection within the variability of the experiment with the exception of the 30 mg/kg dose administered once a day. Dosing starting before infection does not provide any significant benefit as compared to dosing starting after infection. It is also interesting to note that dosing at 60 mg/kg tid versus QD administration of the same dose provided similar levels of protection.",

However, this treatment of influenza A virus H1N1-infected mice with 2'FdC at 30 mg/kg/d twice a day for 5 days was not as effective as the treatment of influenza A H1N1infected with ribavirin at 75 mg/kg/d using the same treatment regimen. Similar efficacy may have been achieved if mice had been treated with the 60 mg/kg/d dose of 2'FdC, which is closer to a molar equivalent of ribavirin used at 75 mg/kg/d.",
