The cornerstone of initial management is treating the hypoxia with supplemental oxygen with a goal of oxygen saturation of 90% or greater. Despite adequate oxygen saturation, CO 2 retention due to the obstructive nature of the disease can occur insidiously with little change in symptoms. Thus, oxygen administration should be carefully monitored by frequent clinical assessment, continuous pulse oximetry, and arterial blood gases, when needed. Excessive supplemental oxygen in this small subset of patients can cause respiratory arrest secondary to loss of their hypoxemia-induced ventilatory drive. Relief of airflow obstruction (bronchoconstriction) is usually accomplished by administration of either intermittent doses of aerosolized b 2 -agonists or anticholinergics, such as ipratropium. Systemic corticosteroids are indicated in severe exacerbations of COPD.
