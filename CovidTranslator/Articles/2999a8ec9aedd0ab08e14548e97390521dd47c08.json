            "text": "In this work, we explored the acid-induced unfolding pathway of non-porin outer membrane protein (OMP), an immunogenic protein from Salmonella Typhi, by monitoring the conformational changes over a pH range of 1.0-7.0 by circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, ANS binding, acrylamide quenching, and dynamic light scattering. The spectroscopic measurements showed that OMP in its native state at pH 7.0 exists in more stable and compact conformation. In contrast, at pH 2.0, OMP retains substantial amount of secondary structure, disrupted side chain interactions, increased hydrodynamic radii, and nearly four-fold increase in ANS fluorescence with respect to the native state, indicating that MG state exists at pH 2.0. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by acrylamide further confirmed the accumulation of a partially unfolded state between native and unfolded state. The effect of pH on the conformation and thermostability of OMP points towards its heat resistance at neutral pH (T m~6 9\u00b0C at pH 7.0, monitored by change in MRE 222 nm ). Acid unfolded state was also characterized by the lack of a cooperative thermal transition. All these results suggested that acid-induced unfolded state of OMP at pH 2.0 represented the molten globule state. The chemical denaturation studies with GuHCl and urea as denaturants showed dissimilar results. The chemical unfolding experiments showed that in both far-UV CD and fluorescence measurements, GuHCl is more efficient than urea. GuHCl is characterized by low C m (~1 M), while urea is characterized by high C m (~3 M). The fully unfolded states were reached at 2 M GuHCl and 4 M urea concentration, respectively. This study adds to several key considerations of importance in the development of therapeutic agents against typhoid fever for clinical purposes.",

Salmonella species cause typhoid fever and gastroenteritis in humans and pose a global threat to human health (Valdez et al. 2009 ). This potentially fatal systemic illness affects at least 21 million people annually, primarily in developing countries (Barquist et al. 2013; Bhutta and Threlfall 2009; Kothari et al. 2008) . Salmonella also infects a broad array of animals, resulting in diseases ranging from gastroenteritis to life-threatening systemic infections (Chiu et al. 2004; McClelland et al. 2001 ).

As there is not any high resolved full-length structure of OMP from Salmonella Typhi in the Protein Data Bank, the protein was modeled by Phyre2 (Kelley and Sternberg 2009 ) by using the sequence as given in Supplementary Figure S1 . For such a large intact protein, part of the structure was generated based on the remote homology/ fold recognition approach by taking the template of Dnad from Bacillus subtilis (2 V79), whereas the rest 366 residues were built by ab initio method. Predicted 3D models were verified by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. 1993) , and validation of stereo-chemical quality of the model was performed through ERRAT, PDBSUM, and Verify3D. The structure was visualized by PyMol version 0.99 (DeLano 2002) . Most proteins, however, possess multiple Trp residues, and the overall protein emission, naturally, yields only average information on the protein structure. OMP is a multitryptophan-containing protein (Trp88, 138, 176, 324, and 366) . Trp88 is located at the central part of helix 1 region. Trp138 is located at the large N-terminal helix (Fig. 1) . The even distributions of the five Trp in OMP make Trp fluorescence an excellent probe for monitoring the structural changes of the protein. Analysis of the accessible surface area of these Trp by the InterProSurf (Negi et al. 2007 ) indicates the following accessibility order: Trp176>Trp366>Trp38>Trp324>Trp88. Out of the total accessible surface area (29,413 \u00c5 2 ) of the OMP, apolar residues contribute in greater extent (19,761 \u00c5 2 ) than the polar residues (9,651 \u00c5 2 ). Supplementary Figure S2 demonstrated the distribution of OMP amino acid residues. In Supplementary Figure S3 , Ramachandran plot analysis showed that 67.5 % of all residues are located in the most favored regions, 22.6 % are in additionally allowed regions, 4.4 % residues fell in generously allowed regions, and 5.5 % are in disallowed regions (Table S1 Supplementary information).",

The far-UV CD spectra of OMP were recorded over the pH range 1.0-7.0 to investigate the influence of pH on protein structure as shown in Fig Table 1 . Figure 2b shows the percent loss of \u03b1helical structures for OMP as pH changes from 7.0 to 1.0. The average helical contents of OMP remained equal up to pH 5.0. At pH 7.0, the OMP shows higher helicity (35 %) as compared to the OMP at acidic pH. There is a steady decrease in helicity values for pH 6.0 (33 %), pH 5.0 (32 %), and pH 2.0 (26 %). This suggests that neutral pH has a greater secondary structural integrity and stability as compared to the acid ones. However, at very low pH 2.0, all the proteins got unfolded by losing their native secondary structure. Further, the \u03b8 208 /\u03b8 222 ratio for the OMP appears nearly identical from pH 7.0 to 2.0, which is between 0.92 and 0.95 (Table 1 ).

The microenvironmental modifications of OMP aromatic residues due to denaturation by pH were studied by monitoring the changes in the fluorescence spectra as a function of pH. In proteins, Trp is highly sensitive to the polarity of its surrounding environment, and OMP is a muti-Trp-containing protein. The native protein showed an emission maximum at 340 nm suggesting the solvent exposure of some of the Trp residues is in the hydrophobic core of the protein at native condition ( Fig. 3a) . At pH 2.0, FI was reduced to 53 % along with a red shift of 10 nm indicating that Trp microenvironment became polar. Probably the structural perturbation (as observed in CD results) has fetched some of the Trp residues in a polar environment resulting in formation of a partially unfolded state at pH 2.0. Progressive lowering of pH led to rise in \u03bb max (wavelength maxima). The \u03bb max for 6.0 M GuHCl denatured state was red shifted to 355 nm with concomitant decrease in FI indicating that Trp residues are maximally exposed to the solvent. Figure 3b summarizes pH-dependent changes in FI and \u03bb max of OMP. A significant decline in FI and increase in \u03bb max was noticed between pH 7.0 and pH 2.0. As pH was lowered further from pH 2.0, the FI at 340 nm began to increase, crossing a value of 30 at pH 1.0 and finally reaching 32 at pH 1.0 with simultaneous increase in \u03bb max . These observations suggest that protein conformation under acidic conditions is different from native and 6.0 M GuHCl denatured state. This means that tryptophan fluorescence maxima are dependent on the hydrophobicity of the surrounding environment.",

However, at pH 2.0, the ANS emission maximum got shifted to 485 nm indicating greater solvent exposure of the hydrophobic patches of OMP as compared to native OMP (Fig. 4a) . The fluorescence intensity of the ANS spectrum of OMP is at 480 nm as shown in Fig. 4b . This proves that during acid denaturation, some of the solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches of OMP become inaccessible. The ANS binding to OMP increases with a drop in pH values from 7.0 to 2.0, which reveals greater solvent exposure of hydrophobic patches. However, below pH 2.0, the effect gets suddenly reversed showing decreased fluorescence intensity. Thus, less hydrophobic regions of OMP are now being exposed to solvent. At pH 2.0, OMP possibly attains an intermediate state with the maximum fluorescence intensity and a large solvent-exposed hydrophobic region.

Table 2 shows the quenching parameters obtained by analyzing the Stern-Volmer plots. The Stern-Volmer constant (K sv ) for the native OMP was found to be 8.3 M \u22121 . However, the value of K sv for the molten globule state is 12 M \u22121 . The Stern-Volmer plot indicates that the aromatic amino acids at pH 2.0 are more exposed compared to the native folded conformation at pH 7.0; therefore, tryptophan fluorescence is quenched more in the case of the former. For the fully denatured protein in 6.0 M GuHCl, the K sv value becomes quite large, being 16 M \u22121 , respectively, indicating a large increase in solvent exposure of tryptophan residues.",

Most of the proteins are characterized by well-defined three-dimensional structures, which in general exist only within the limits of specific environmental conditions. Outside these conditions, proteins exhibit denatured and structurally unfolded states. Ellipticity plots, at 222 nm, are shown, as a function of temperature, together with the two-state model fits (Eq. 5). The thermal stability curve of OMP at pH 7.0 and pH 2.0 shows that the greatest thermal stability is observed near neutral pH. This result indicates cooperativity at pH 7.0 and absence of cooperativity as expected for a non-compact structure at pH 2.0. At pH 7.0, the secondary structure of OMP was found to be unperturbed up to 50\u00b0C (Fig. 6a) . At pH 7.0, the curve shows a single-phase transition having estimated T m of 69\u00b0C. OMP at pH 2.0 appears to be less stable than the native OMP with a melting temperature (T m ) of~40\u00b0C. These results suggest that ordered and more stable secondary occurs at neutral pH, while at pH 2.0, OMP becomes disordered and thermally less stable.

Figure 6b shows the GuHCl and urea unfolding curves, monitored using far-UV CD spectroscopy, and can be fitted by a two-state model using Eq. 5. Inspection of the individual curves yields denaturant concentrations at the midpoint of the transitions, C m , of 1.0 M for the GuHCl.

Further addition of GuHCl to 3.1 M led to the loss of structure (Fig. 6b ) as the MRE 222 nm completely disappeared. OMP is quite stable in the presence of 1.5 M urea than the GuHCl 0.5 M since the MRE 222 nm signal of the OMP is essentially distinguishable and very different from that of unfolded protein under folded conditions.

Denaturation of OMP was monitored by measurement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the GuHCl-treated samples. The GuHCl and urea induced breakdown of the native tertiary structure (FI 340 nm ).

The \"m values\" were very dissimilar at pH 7.0 for GuHCl and urea (2.7 and 1.9 kcal mol \u22121 M \u22121 ), which suggests that almost the same states are involved in the unfolding transition.

Therefore, unfolding behavior and kinetics were studied for OMP as a model for bacterial protein. In the far-UV CD region, native OMP revealed two well-resolved negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm. The CD signals at 222 nm were more prominent, indicating high level of structural integrity of the protein. Significantly larger changes were observed in the CD spectra recorded at pH 2.0, suggesting the occurrence of a pH-induced unfolding transition in this pH range. The OMP loses all of its secondary structural integrity around 2 M GuHCl or 4 M urea, as it is evident by complete disappearance of all the characteristic peaks in far-UV CD spectra measurements. In principle, unfolded states are rather heterogeneous, and the mechanisms leading to unfolded states are rather different for thermal, pH, or GuHCl and ureainduced unfolding ).",

This is related to the fact that DLS technique detects global changes of the protein molecule. Our DLS data show that the lowering of pH values in the order pH 7.0>pH 6.0>pH 5.0>pH 4.0>pH 3.0>pH 2.0 favors the unfolding process led by an increase in hydrodynamic radii. Our present results are consistent with previous observations, based on DLS, enhanced ANS binding, retention of significant secondary structures, and disrupted tertiary structure. All these results suggested that the acid-induced state of OMP at pH 2.0 is characterized as molten globule state.",

This probably allows the protein to fold and function in even challenging environment that may differ from its normal environment under certain circumstances. Such ability might have also helped proteins to survive evolutionary selection pressure and even to attain environment-specific conformations since we now know that most proteins acquire closely similar conformations instead of a unique conformation.",

After the thermal denaturation transitions went to completion, the OMP solutions were cooled down to 20\u00b0C at the same scan speed, and further, the OMP samples are heated up to 90\u00b0C. From the obtained results, it is clear that the secondary structures of the native polypeptide were not recovered after the sample was cooled down to the initial temperature by MRE 222 nm measurements. Similarly, no detectable recovery in the secondary structures was observed for other heating rates (data not shown). These results indicate that thermal unfolding of OMP is highly irreversible. The irreversible process seems to be the more common case for most proteins, such as peroxidase (Zamorano et al. 2009 ), triose phosphate isomerase (Shi et al. 2008) , \u03b1-amylase (Sugahara et al. 2013) , yeast hexokinase B (Ramshini et al. 2008) , and latex amine oxidase (Amani et al. 2007) .",

            "text": "Salmonella Typhi is a pathogenic bacterium that causes a number of infectious diseases such as gastroenteritis and typhoid fever (Kaur and Jain 2012) . Before orally ingested enteric pathogens Salmonella can reach their target host cells, they must first survive their encounter with the low pH of the human stomach, approximately pH 2.0 following a fast. The low pH of the gastric environment provides Salmonella Typhi the ability to survive at low pH. This is an extremely hostile environment, thus Salmonella contains multiple inducible systems to aid in survival at low pH (Brenneman et al. 2013; Kaur and Jain 2012) . Enteric pathogens, in order to gain entrance into the intestine and cause disease, must survive the acid pH of the stomach. Pathogenic species that prefer to grow at neutral pH exhibit widely varying abilities to survive pH extremes. However, there is increasing evidence that molten globules are common and that they play a key role in a wide variety of physiological processes, including translocation across membranes, increased affinity for membranes, binding to liposome and phospholipids, protein trafficking, extracellular secretion, and the control and regulation of the cell cycle (Morrow et al. 2002) . Structural stability can also be seen in Diphtheria toxin T and SARS-CoV main protease, while other proteins, such as human alkaline phosphatase, human apolipoprotein E, and malic enzyme, have been shown to undergo a significant molten globule transition state during the unfolding process (Chang et al. 2007; Hung and Chang 2001; Morrow et al. 2002; Rodnin et al. 2008 ). In addition, the development of methods to fold integral membrane proteins to their active form is of significant technological importance.",
