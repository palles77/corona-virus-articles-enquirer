Although most of the patients were eligible for vaccination, we observed strikingly low vaccination rate. Our study also confirmed the high frequency of S. aureus superinfection in patients with influenza similar to the previous report. 9 Similar to previous studies of hospitalized patients' severity of illness was associated with increased hospital mortality rate in our cohort. 10 Importantly, our findings suggest that death during interpandemic periods is commonly associated with ARDS, which is similar to the pandemic findings. 11 An important risk factor for both the development of ARDS and mortality was immunosuppression. 12 The mechanisms of the development of ARDS associated with influenza are still undetermined and may include direct cytotoxicity and apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, as well as modification of the host inflammatory response with or without concurrent or secondary bacterial infection. 13 Recently, angiotensin converting enzyme receptors have been identified as the key targets for alveolar cell cytotoxicity secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 14 During interpandemic periods, patients with influenza pneumonia are more likely to have underlying cardiopulmonary disease, with mortality reported from 6% to 29%. 15 More than half (58%) of patients in our cohort had a history of chronic lung disease. 16 A pooled cohort study published after the meta-analyses demonstrated a small but significant reduction in mortality in vaccinated elderly individuals (1.0% vs 1.6% in unvaccinated individuals 17 ). In our study, only 35 (31.5%) patients admitted to the ICU with laboratory confirmed influenza were vaccinated, although the vast majority (95%) who were not vaccinated were eligible based on either age (68.5%) or chronic co-morbidity criteria (82.9%) according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) criteria. 18 Although the degree of protection in elderly patients is less than that afforded to healthy younger adults, 19 our findings potentially indirectly support the benefit from influenza vaccination for vulnerable patient population with only 35% vaccination rate. [20] [21] [22] Antiviral therapy is an important strategy for the control of influenza disease while the efficacy of these agents is limited by timing of administration. Good results were obtained when the antiviral treatment was started within 48 h after inoculation 23 and only a few studies showed good results when the antiviral treatment was started after 48 h. 24 Patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to influenza often do not enter the ICU until 2-4 days after the onset of symptoms, when the viral load in respiratory secretions is already high, which make it difficult to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral therapy in our study.",
