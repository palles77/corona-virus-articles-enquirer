Infected enterocytes were replaced with euboidal cells from the crypts, and the lesion gradually healed by 5 days after infection.

Many enterocytes in the ileum at 14 hours p.i. contained large ovoid vacuoles apical to the nucleus, although the villi were long and slender. Changes were first observed at 23 hours p.i. in the midgut. Here the villi were long and their lateral margins contained many clefts or mieroerypts (Fig. 2) , compared with control villi (Fig. 3) . The enteroeytes lining the lower one-third of the villi appeared normal, but those of the apical two-thirds had rounded margins and were cuboidal rather than columnar. Many enterocytes contained large single basal vacuoles and multiple small apicM vacuoles (Fig. 4) . The apical vacuoles often impinged upon and indented the nucleus, which consequently appeared collapsed or pyknotic. Both apical and basal vacuoles contained pleomorphie Schiff-negative bodies which stained deep mahagony-red by Pollak's trichrome method. Similar intra-eytoplasmie bodies were also seen in some enteroeytes and subepithelial maerophages, usually close to the nucleus. These bodies were most clearly demonstrated in araldite s~etions (Fig. 5) , and have been shown subsequently (GRAY, E. W., in preparation) to contain arrays of astrovirus partieles. The lamina propria of affected villi contained moderate numbers of maerophages with abundant cytoplasm. Goblet cell numbers were comparable to controls. The ileum was unaffected at this stage; single clear apical vacuoles were present in many of the enterocytes. By 38 hours p.i., villi in midgut and ileum were obviously shorter and more spatulate than those in equivalent control sites, or at earlier stages of the infection. At 45 hours p.i., villi in the midgut and ileum were short and blunt with crenated epithelium, and crypts which were elongated contained numerous mitotic figures. The lamina propria contained infiltrates of macrophages, lymphoeytes and neutrophils, as well as eosinophils in similar numbers to the control iambs. None of the enteroeytes in the midgut contained the multiple apical vacuoles and granular bodies seen at 23 hours p.i. IJ[owevcr, single apical vacuoles were seen in the ileum of the infected Iambs at 38 and 45 hours p.i. By 70 hours p.i. the villi in the midgut site were long and slender and indistinguishable from normal intestine, but those in the ileum were stunted and lined by a erenated, partly euboidal epithelium. At 5 days p.i., however, all three intestinal sites were morphologically normal.",

Immunofluorescence showed less evidence of virus multiplication in jejunum than in other levels of small intestine, and this was reflected in the absence of histological change. Crypt hypertrophy was, however, as marked in jejunmn as at more distal sites, but the stimulus for this is not known.

This effect is similar to that of other viral infections of villus epithelial cells, particularly rotavirus (16, 18) and coronavirus (3, 10, 13) infections. In the lamb, astrovirus infection is at each stage less severe than rotavirus infection (16, 17) , with fewer enterocytes infected, a lesser degree of villus atrophy and a milder clinical disease.",
