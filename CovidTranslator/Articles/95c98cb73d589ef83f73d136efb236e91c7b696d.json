            "text": "An essential element of Ebola control involves monitoring and movement restrictions for people who come into contact with an Ebola patient while the patient is infectious. Although procedures can vary by local regulations, monitoring and movement restrictions for Ebola contacts normally last for 21 days after the last exposure to the infectious patient. Contact monitoring and movement restrictions allow for early identification of disease to prevent further transmission. 1 However, movement restrictions also limit a contact's ability to meet some of his or her own daily living needs. Ensuring that measures and processes are in place to provide for these needs is an important component of implementing movement restrictions. Stigmatization of contacts because of community fears creates an additional need for supports. 2 A previous report of a related Ebola investigation in Texas described the needs of Ebola contacts, including basic needs for food, financial assistance, and education. In that investigation, health officials found that meeting the needs of Ebola contacts was essential to successful contact monitoring. 3 Providing for the daily needs of people whose movement is restricted during an outbreak response is not new to public health. This need was noted during the typhus and cholera epidemics in New York City in 1892 4 and during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Taiwan and Canada in 2013, where affected individuals experienced uncomfortable surroundings, discrimination, uncertainty, and a need for family support. 5, 6 We discuss the importance of preparing for such daily needs and how the Ebola experience in Ohio adds to the Texas report to inform future situations in which movement restrictions are needed.",

As described previously, 7 contacts in Ohio were risk-stratified into tiers modified from CDC's guidelines for monitoring and movement restriction 1 based on type and duration of exposure and proximity to the nurse. Contact monitoring entailed twice-daily monitoring of temperature and symptoms. Three contacts were under direct active monitoring, where monitoring by public health officials was conducted twice daily (once in person and once by telephone), and under home quarantine (Tier 1). Seventeen contacts were under direct active monitoring and were not allowed to travel by public transportation or leave their jurisdiction without notifying local health officials (Tier 2a). An additional 94 contacts were under active monitoring, where monitoring by public health officials was conducted once daily by phone and the contacts were not allowed to travel internationally (Tier 2b). Fifty contacts self-monitored and had no movement restrictions (Tier 3). During the initial phase of the response, Ohio's monitoring and movement guidance was still being developed, and several contacts eventually categorized as Tier 2a were initially asked to voluntarily remain in their homes until further guidance was provided.",

As part of daily monitoring, local health officials regularly asked if contacts had any needs.

The public sometimes incorrectly perceived close relatives and friends of contacts who had had no contact with the Ebola patient as contacts. This misperception was exacerbated by a misunderstanding that interaction with a contact was the same as exposure to an Ebola patient. Stigmatization resulting from a lack of knowledge about how Ebola is spread, a need to find blame for Ebola, fear about disease and death from Ebola, and the gossip that spreads false information, rumors, myths, and fears about Ebola may have contributed to this misperception ( Table 2 ). 9 Because they were falsely perceived by the public as contacts themselves, these perceived contacts had many of the same needs as actual contacts, and examples of their needs are also described.",

For example, local law enforcement officers had to make a special effort to protect a contact's privacy by erecting a barrier to deter members of the news media from approaching the contact's residence. All 3 contacts under home quarantine reported feeling trapped in their residences. Many other contacts reported feeling socially isolated because of public fear and misconceptions. The employers of a few contacts opted to have them not return to work during the monitoring period. Health officials sought to counter these misperceptions through public education, including press releases, media interviews, community meetings, and responses to public inquiries. For example, Summit County Public Health established an information line to give the public extended access to health department staff members for inquiries.",

Additionally, local, state, and federal public health officials partnered to provide guidance on residence decontamination and care for contacts' animals in case the contact became ill. One quarantined contact expressed concern about a lack of physical activity. In response, health officials obtained and delivered indoor exercise equipment. Another quarantined contact requested that local health officials deliver over-the-counter medications during scheduled monitoring sessions. Yet another contact had preexisting medical conditions that required health officials to coordinate with the patient's medical provider to develop care guidelines that would protect the patient from any possibility of exposure to Ebola and that could differentiate between the preexisting conditions and symptoms of Ebola. The child of 1 contact was inappropriately denied urgent medical care even though the child had never been in contact with the nurse and posed no risk to providers or other patients.

A few other such contacts reported concerns about job loss or loss of income while away from work. In at least 1 instance, a social service agency provided supplemental funds to help support a contact who was not permitted to return to work during monitoring.

First, we observed how important it was for local public health officials, who led efforts to provide for the needs of contacts, to form partnerships with state and federal public health officials, social services agencies, legal counsel, health care providers, friends and relatives of contacts, community partners, businesses, and schools. Previous assessments described the importance of developing multisector partnerships. For example, Kun et al 12 described the extent to which state, local, and territorial health departments strengthened partnerships during the US response to novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. During that pandemic, CDC Public Health Emergency Response grantees reported substantial strengthening of partnerships with pharmacies, schools, medical providers, education authorities, and businesses. Chi et al 13 described Los Angeles County Department of Public Health partnerships with diverse community partners to develop Community Disaster Resilience in general and identified lack of training in engaging community partners as a leading barrier to partnerships. Through partnerships, Ohio public health officials provided public education and addressed contacts' needs during an Ebola response, thereby providing for the well-being of contacts and facilitating cooperation with public health monitoring.",

Indeed, stigmatization and discrimination were the most common issues described. Although public health officials worked assiduously to educate the public, the emergent nature of Ebola still generated concern and fear about the disease and how it is transmitted. This concern and fear resulted in unnecessary negative consequences for contacts and their friends and relatives (eg, exclusion from school or work, refusal to provide medical care). Public health partners can take measures to counter stigmatization during Ebola responses (Table 2) .",

The impact of Ebola extended beyond the contacts. For example, the public sometimes incorrectly viewed friends and relatives of contacts as being contacts. Public health officials had to plan for the needs of these individuals in addition to the needs of the contacts themselves.",

This gap limited our ability to quantify the needs of contacts and likely resulted in an underestimation of these needs. Using standardized data collection tools in future responses would allow investigators to quantify needs; improve the way in which contacts' needs are identified, tracked, and aligned with resources of community partners; and demonstrate more conclusively the essential role that meeting needs may have on successful monitoring. Innovative opportunities to improve data are potentially available. For example, Sawyer et al 14 proposed the development and use of smartphone application technology to help health departments quickly organize community partner resources during an infectious disease outbreak and produce quantifiable data for program evaluation and planning. The findings and experiences from the Ohio Ebola investigation can be used to inform future emerging infectious disease responses that involve contact monitoring and movement restriction.",
