It was also found that the viability of bacillus decreases with the increase of the duration. In addition, the comparative survival ratio (CSR) of B. subtilis decreases to 35% even during a short duration as the applied field reaches an enough high value of more than 15 kV/cm. These indicated that the uniform field inactivated the viability of B. subtilis availability.

The natural survival ratio (NSR) is defined as the fraction of the number of viable colonies after being placed for a period of time in the number of viable colonies when the placed time is 0 s. Experiments were performed repeatedly and all results were expressed as mean values. Fig. 1 shows the NSR of B. subtilis changed along with the placed duration in the case without the applying field. It can be found that the NSR decreases with the increase of the placed duration. When the placed duration is 30 min, the NSR is about 50%. With a further increase in the placed duration, the B. subtilis solutions on the glass slice can be air dried and the nutriments are consumed; thus, the death of a large amount of organisms made the continuation of experiments difficult. inactivation effects of electric field, check experiments of samples without applying voltage were carried out at the same time. After the plates were incubated at 37 1C for 24 h, the colony number was counted and the CSR was calculated. The CSR was defined as the fraction of the viable colony number after voltage was applied in the viable colony number from check experiment. According to this definition, the influences of natural decease of B. subtilis on the inactivation effect of applied field can no doubt be eliminated. It was found that with the increase of the actuation duration, the CSR decreased at any given field. The CSR is kept at about 35%, if the applying field is larger than 15 kV/cm. Fig. 3 typically shows the photos of the B. subtilis with and without an applying field of 20 kV/cm for 20 min. This further indicates that the applied field affects the viability of B. subtilis.",

(1) can be deformed as In order to verify the effectiveness of electret films, the charged PP film with a charge density of 12 mC/m 2 was spread with B. subtilis suspensions for a period of time. The check experiments of samples dealt with uncharged PP film were also carried through at the same time. The viability of B. subtilis varied along with the actuation duration is shown in Fig. 4 . Similar to the result shown in the case of an applied field with 5 kV/cm in Fig. 2 , the CSR of B. subtilis of charged PP films decreases with the increase of actuation duration as shown in Fig. 4 . According to Eq. (2), the surface charge density of PP film was about 12 mC/m 2 corresponding with E of 7 kV/cm. Thus the electrical field shaped by electrodes used in our experiment correlates well with the one shaped by the electret films. This indicates that the charged PP films show the same inactivation effect on B. subtilis as the plane-plane electrode system does. In other words, the electret films can effectively inactivate the bacteria. The experiments indicated that when the field is larger than 15 kV/cm, the CSR of B. subtilis is about 35%. According to Eq. (2), if E is about 15 kV/cm, then r s is 27 mC/m 2 . Further work, however, should be carried out in the manufacture of higher charge density PP films to improve the inactivation effect and this can be encouraged by the fact that r s of electret films arrived at 30 mC/m 2 without difficulty [7] .",

(2) The uniform electrostatic field generated by plane-plane electrodes inactivated the viability of B. subtilis availability. (3) The CSR decreases with the increase of actuation duration. (4) The CSR of B. subtilis decreases to 35% even during a very short duration as the applied field reach to an enough high value of more than 15 kV/cm. (5) The total survival ratio of B. subtilis is no more than 20% when the electrical field reached 15 kV/cm and the actuation duration reached 20 min. (6) The charged PP films show the same inactivation effect on B. subtilis as the plane-plane electrode system does. The electret films can effectively inactivate the bacteria.",
