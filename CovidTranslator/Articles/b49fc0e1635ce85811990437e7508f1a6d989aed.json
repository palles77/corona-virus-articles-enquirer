Host antibodies induced following EAV infection hound the recombinant antigen by ELISA. The ELISA specificity and sensitivity were determined with a panel of equine sera including postinfection and postvaccination samples. A good correlation existed between EAV neutralizing antibody titers and ELISA absorbance values (r = 0.827). The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were 99.6 and 90.1%, respectively, compared with the EAV neutralization test and the recombinant antigen did not crossreact in ELISA with equine sera directed against other common equine respiratory viruses. Three post-EAV infection equine sera raised against different EAV isolates reacted strongly in the ELISA, as did two equine sera raised against EAV vaccines, indicating that the viral epitope was conserved between the viruses tested. Following vaccination with an inactivated whole virus vaccine, antibody detected with the recombinant antigen ELISA preceded the development of a virus-neutralizing response. The study demonstrates the potential application of rG,55-98 as a diagnostic antigen.",

The disease has been known for some 40 years and manifests itself with widely varying clinical signs. In its most severe form equine arteritis virus (EAV) infection causes abortion (Doll et al., 1957) and foal death (Golnik et al., 1981; Vaala et al., 19921, although it is more usual for this virus to cause mild respiratory disease (Chirnside, 1992) . Disease outbreaks are identified infrequently due to clinically inapparent infection and field isolates of the virus are rare. The causative agent, EAV, is a small positive single-stranded RNA virus with a genome organization, mode of replication and gene expression strategy similar to that of corona-and toroviruses (de Vries et al., 1990 (de Vries et al., , 1992 den Boon et al., 1991; Snijder et al., 1994) . EAV has recently been classified in the genus arterivirus (Cavanagh et al., 1994) along with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus of mice (LDV) (Godeny et al., 1993; Kuo et al., 1992) , simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) , and the virus causing porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRSV) (Conzelmann et al., 1993) Lelystad virus (LV) (Meulenberg et al., 1993) .",

EVA is geographically widespread (Chirnside, 1992) and most European and North American countries have EAV-seropositive animals. Some outbreaks have occurred following the importation of persistently infected animals causing primary transmission of EAV by the venereal route, followed by secondary respiratory spread (Wood et al., 1995) .

The ELISA has a relatively low specificity when applied to sera from horses previously vaccinated against equine influenza and herpesviruses; this is primarily due to host antibody induced by tissue culture contaminants of these vaccines reacting with cell culture-derived antigen present in the whole-virus ELISA antigen. The CF test has limited temporal sensitivity and is consequently only useful for serodiagnosis up to 6 weeks postinfection.

Transformations with plasmid pGEX-3X (Smith and Johnson, 1988) were carried out in Escherichia coli TGl and recombinant clones selected by antibiotic resistance. Clones were subsequently screened for fusion protein expression after IPTG induction by analysis in SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and the EAV-specific insert size, orientation and in-frame insertion confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion analysis and dsDNA sequencing of purified plasmid DNA (Chirnside et al., 1995) . The expression construct SRsal, expressing rG,55-98, comprised nucleotides 11,310-11,441 of EAV open reading frame (ORF) 5 fused in-frame to the carboxyl-terminus of the glutathione-S-transferase gene in the expression vector pGEX-3X. Fusion protein was affinity purified using glutathione Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). A 250-ml culture of bacterial cells expressing recombinant antigen was harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 6000 g and 4\u00b0C resuspended in 50 ml 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.001, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl (STE) and recentrifuged to pellet the cells. The supernatant was discarded and the cells resuspended in 3 ml STE, 50 ~1 lysozyme (50 mg/ml) added and the tube incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. The tube was then frozen at -70\u00b0C overnight followed by a short immersion in a boiling water bath to thaw the frozen suspension. DNase 1 (20 pg) and 30 ~1 of 1 M MgCl, were then added to the thawed cells and the tube incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of l%, the mixture kept on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 g and 4\u00b0C for 10 min. Glutathione Sepharose 4B gel was added to the supernatant and the solution mixed by gentle agitation on a rotary mixer for 20 min. The gel was washed 3 times with PBS and the recombinant antigen eluted from the gel with reduced glutathione (5 mM glutathione, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)). Eluate was collected in l-ml fractions and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to pooling fractions containing purified protein. Pooled protein was dispensed into 500-~1 aliquots and frozen at -20\u00b0C until used. Protein concentration was determined with a modified Lowry reagent solution from a Protein Assay Kit (Sigma).",

However in its present format, the correlation between the rG,55-98 ELISA and NT is high (r = 0.827) with the ELBA detecting additional seropositives to the NT. The ELISA+/ NT results could be due to differences in sensitivity between the two tests or because the ELISA detects equine antibodies that bind EAV G,, of which those capable of neutralizing virus in a NT are a subpopulation.",

However, following one or two doses of an inactivated vaccine, it was possible to demonstrate ELISA+/NT-results in 39% of vaccinees. If a similar situation exists following natural infection with EAV, then the additional seropositive field samples detected by ELISA may have originated from horses previously infected with EAV, but in which a virus neutralizing antibody response was not induced or in which the response has dropped below detectable levels. This observation requires further investigation since the presence of circulating virus neutralizing antibody has to date been accepted as evidence of prior exposure to EAV, either through infection or vaccination. The rG,5.5-98 ELISA results suggest this may not be the case.",

However, the hydropathy profile (de Vries et al., 1992) and position of the sole N-glycosylation site (den Boon et al., 1991) both determine that the protein ectodomain is likely to encompass residues 19-115. By testing > 1500 equine sera in ELISA to G,55-98, we have demonstrated that amino acid residues 55-98 of the Bucyrus strain of EAV G,_ encompass a highly immunoreactive antigen which correlates closely with the host virus neutralizing response. EAV G, has been shown to contain a major antigenic site (Chirnside et al., 1995) and virus neutralizing murine monoclonal antibodies react with a protein of a molecular size (29 kDa) equivalent to G,, by Western blots (Balasuriya et al., 1993; Deregt et al., 1994) .",

Additionally, the enhanced detection of seropositive animals allied to a vaccination policy and selective breeding practices would allow the better control and possible eradication of EAV from the breeding population. The expression and purification of G,55-98 is simple and the ELISA is easily standardized between different testing laboratories. Since the recombinant protein is not infectious it affords the opportunity to undertake EAV serodiagnostic assays rapidly and safely without virus containment facilities. In addition, the use of a purified protein expressed in a bacterial system removes the problem of non-specific antibody crossreactivity to cell culture-derived antigen which has plagued previous EAV ELISA tests (Cook et al., 1989) .",
