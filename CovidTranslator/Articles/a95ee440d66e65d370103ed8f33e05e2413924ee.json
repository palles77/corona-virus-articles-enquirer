There have been 43 deaths so far. 1, 2 The source of human infection appears to be poultry. 1, [3] [4] [5] There is so far no evidence of sustained humanto-human transmission within the community. Genetic analysis of these viruses revealed that all eight gene segments were of avian origin; six internal gene segments were derived from avian infl uenza A H9N2 viruses found in poultry in Asia, and the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes were derived from infl uenza viruses circulating in ducks and wild birds, respectively. 1 Human infections with other H7 infl uenza viruses (H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7) have previously been reported in the Netherlands, Canada, USA, and UK 6 in association with outbreaks in poultry and resulted in conjunctivitis with mild upper respiratory symptoms. However, there was one fatal case in the Netherlands. 6, 7 Cytokine dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of human disease caused by highly pathogenic avian infl uenza A H5N1 as well as the 1918 pandemic H1N1 viruses. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] By comparison with seasonal infl uenza viruses, some highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5N1 viruses induced higher concentrations of proinfl ammatory cytokines from human alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. 8, 9, [11] [12] [13] We previously used ex-vivo cultures of human conjunctiva, nasopharynx, tonsil, bronchus and lung to investigate infl uenza 14, 15 and coronavirus tropism 16 and used in-vitro cultures of polarised primary human alveolar epithelial cells and peripheral blood monocyte derived macrophages to compare innate immune responses elicited by diff erent infl uenza viruses. 8, 9, 12, 13 In this study, we used these ex-vivo and in-vitro models of cultured human tissues and cells to compare the virus tropism and host innate immune responses of the novel A H7N9 infl uenza virus with that of the pandemic H1N1 virus, highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5N1 and H7N7 viruses, and a low pathogenic duck H7N9 virus.",

A sialidase specifi c for cleaving the \u03b1-2,3 glycosidic abolished the haemagglutination of turkey red blood cells by H5N1 virus, but did not aff ect haemagglutination by Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9 viruses suggesting that both Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 predominantly bind \u03b1-2,6 glycans, irrespective of diff erences in aminoacid residues Gln226Leu, Ser138Ala, and Gly186Val of haemagglutinin. Both Sh1/ H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 have lost a glycosylation site (Thy160Ala) in the 150-loop of haemagglutinin that is known to result in increased affi nity for binding \u03b1-2,6linked glycans in H5N1 viruses. 4 By contrast, others have reported that a recombinant Sh2/H7N9-like virus haemagglutinin bound poorly to human trachea and a Gly228Ser aminoacid change was needed to confer improved binding to the human upper airways. 18 Recombinant viral haemagglutinin might not accurately refl ect haemagglutinin binding of native virions where multivalent trimeric haemagglutinin is present together with neuraminidase and fails to take into account any Recent mass spectrometric data have shown that the bronchus contains sialylated \u03b1-2,3 glycans, 19 explaining its infection by avian viruses (H5N1 and H7N7) whose glycan array profi les indicate predominant \u03b1-2,3 receptor binding. Receptor binding and structural analysis of Sh2/H7N9-like virus haemagglutinin shows effi cient binding of both \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 receptors. 20 The functional changes in receptor binding and PB2 Glu627Lys are some of the key functional changes identifi ed by Herfst and colleagues 21 in 2012 to be important in adapting an avian H5N1 virus towards transmission in mammals. Since A/Hong Kong/483/97 (H5N1) virus also has lysine at position 627 in PB2, the effi cient replication of H7N9 viruses in human ex-vivo cultures of the bronchus is unlikely to be explained solely on this basis.",

            "text": "Autopsy data for the lung would provide useful data to understand the pathogenesis of human A H7N9 disease. However, autopsy data usually only provide information about lung pathology at late stages of the illness and thus fail to provide insights into virus tropism in the early stages of infection. Thus data from experimental infection of ex-vivo cultures of the respiratory tract provide unique insights into virus tropism and pathogenesis. Reported patients with H7N9 disease have been older than those with human infections with avian H5N1 or H9N2 viruses, and severe disease appears to be more common with increasing age. 3 The biological basis for this unusual epidemiological pattern needs to be understood because it diff ers from that seen in individuals infected with H5N1. Whether milder cases in young people are unrecognised, thereby skewing the case-fatality ratio as well as the age distribution, is unclear. Paediatric lung and bronchial tissues diff er from adult tissues in the balance of sialylated \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 glycans, 19 and this factor might contribute to the increased disease severity with increasing age. However, using similar techniques we found that Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/ H7N9 viruses effi ciently infected ex-vivo lung from a 1-year-old child (data not shown). Chronic lung disease increases numbers of type II pneumocytes (the target cells for infl uenza viruses) and might contribute to an increased disease severity compared with younger, healthier individuals. 22 Dysregulation of proinfl ammatory innate immune responses by highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5N1 virus contributed to the unusual severity of human H5N1 disease and investigation of whether Sh1 or Sh2/H7N9 virus infections lead to exaggerated proinfl ammatory innate immune responses was relevant. Since ex-vivo cultures are heterogeneous in cell type and susceptibility to virus and the infecting dose cannot be precisely controlled, we chose to compare innate immune responses to H7N9 infection with that of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5N1 and H1N1pdm viruses in well defi ned primary human macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells. By comparison with H5N1 virus (a high cytokine-inducing virus) and H1N1pdm virus (a low cytokine-inducing virus), Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 appear to have an intermediate phenotype in their intrinsic capacity to induce proinfl ammatory cytokines such as CCL5 and TNF\u03b1. The expression of interferon stimulated genes (eg, MX1, ISG15) did not appear to be impaired. Lungs and serum of mice experimentally infected with Sh2/H7N9 also had lower concentrations of proinfl ammatory chemokines and cytokines compared with those of H5N1-infected mice. 23 In a patient with mild disease and one with severe disease in whom cytokine concentrations were studied, there was no diff erence in proinfl ammatory cytokines in serum. However, the patient who died had high serum concentrations of the antiinfl ammatory cytokine serum interleukin 10. 5 Raised plasma or lung cytokine concentration might be secondary to more severe pathology in severely ill patients, 24 or secondary to increased replication competence of a virus rather than being the intrinsic cause of such pathology. Therefore, the experiments we have described in which similar virus infecting doses of diff erent viruses are compared for their capacity for cytokine induction provides important data to defi ne the intrinsic viral capacity for proinfl ammatory cytokine induction, which might be of relevance for pathogenesis and therapy. From our fi ndings, Sh2/H7N9-like viruses appear to be intrinsically more potent inducers of the proinfl ammatory cytokine responses than are H1N1pdm viruses, but less so than H5N1 viruses. Thus, proinfl ammatory cytokine responses might contribute in part to the severity of human H7N9 disease, but the unusual tissue tropism of this virus for human bronchus and lung and attendant direct viral cytopathology probably has a more important role in pathogenesis, as was seen with the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 16 Our fi ndings suggest that Sh2/H7N9-like avian viruses are exceptionally fi t to infect mammalian species including human beings. Ferrets experimentally infected with Sh2/H7N9 showed effi cient virus replication in the respiratory tract with ineffi cient ferret-to-ferret transmission by airborne droplets. 25 Although no sustained human-to-human transmission has been noted to date, the effi cient replication of these H7N9 viruses in the human respiratory tract and the detection (albeit ineffi cient) of ferret-to-ferret transmission by the airborne route by these viruses without previous adaptation increases the pandemic concern associated with these viruses.",
