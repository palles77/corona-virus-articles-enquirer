These BoCV from the respiratory tract of healthy and clinically ill cattle with BRD signs were compared to reference and vaccine strains based on Spike protein coding sequences and VNT using convalescent antisera. Based on this study, the BoCV isolates belong to one of two genomic clades (clade 1 and 2) which can be differentiated antigenically. The respiratory isolates from Oklahoma in this study were further divided by genetic differences into three subclades, 2a, 2b, and 2c. Reference enteric BoCV strains and a vaccine strain were in clade 1. Currently available vaccines designed to control enteric disease are based on viruses from one clade while viruses isolated from respiratory tracts, in this study, belong to the other clade.",

Infectious agents considered in the etiologies of BRD include viruses: bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), parainfluenza-3 virus (PI-3V), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine adenoviruses (BAV), and bovine coronaviruses (BoCV) and bacteria, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma spp. [1, 2] . For many years, BHV-1, PI-3V, BRSV, and BVDV were the viruses most associated with the viral etiology of BRD. In contrast, BoCV was associated with neonatal enteric disease and winter dysentery of adult cattle [3] [4] [5] . Recently BoCV as a respiratory infection and disease has received attention and has been the subject of multiple reviews [6, 7] .",

            "text": "BoCV are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive sense single stranded RNA viruses that are grouped as a species within the Coronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family [8] . BoCV virions contain a large surface glycoprotein referred to as the spike or S protein, an integral membrane protein (M), a small membrane protein (E), a hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein (HE) and a nucleocapsid protein (N). While strong humoral responses are elicited against the S, M, N and HE proteins following natural infection, the predominant antigens involved in virus neutralization are located in the S and HE proteins. Various studies have segregated the Coronavirus genus into groups based on several criteria, including; position and variation of non-structural proteins in the 3 end of the genome, antigenic cross reactivity, processing of the S protein and host range. However, there are no set guidelines for defining new Coronavirus species or differentiating subgroups within existing species. As stated above BoCV were initially associated with outbreaks of enteric disease. More recently, BoCV have been associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) and in cattle pulled for treatment in the feedlot as well as from healthy cattle in numerous studies in the U.S. In these studies BoCV was identified by virus isolation from nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serotests detecting seroconversions indicating exposure to BoCV in outbreaks of BRD and inapparent infections [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . BoCV have been identified in pneumonic lungs from field cases, often in combination with other viruses and bacteria including Mycoplasma spp. [20] [21] [22] . Experimentally BoCV have caused respiratory tract lesions affecting the epithelium of the turbinates, trachea, and lungs [23] . Based on the observation of two different presentations following BoCV exposure, it has been suggested there is a dual tropism by BoCV for respiratory and digestive tracts of cattle [23, 24] .",

There is a modified live virus vaccine containing BoCV for administration orally to the newborn calf to provide an active immune response to protect the calf against enteric disease [7, 25] . There are no licensed BoCV vaccines in the U.S. to protect against BRD, nor have effectiveness of the licensed enteric BoCV vaccines been determined for protection against BRD with BoCV challenge. However there is one U.S. report using the MLV vaccine containing BoCV that reduced treatment for BRD [26] . The methods of protection as correlates of immunity were not determined however [9] . To provide optimal immunity, vaccine antigens should be as similar as possible to the circulating viruses. It appears important that the virus or viruses used as immunogens to control BoCV BRD should align antigenically and genetically with the BoCV circulating in the field.",

USA, Valencia, CA). A 10 l aliquot of the extracted RNA was amplified using the primer set published by Kanno et al. [33] . The 1194 nucleotide section of the S protein gene that was amplified included the polymorphic region of the S protein gene that was used for phylogenetic analysis in previous studies of Coronavirus [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Amplification was confirmed based on size of amplicon as visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplicons were purified and concentrated using a Geneclean Spin Kit per manufacturers instructions (MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio) followed by quantification using the Pico Green assay for ds DNA (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and the appropriate quantity of dsDNA was labeled in both directions using Big Dye terminator chemistries (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled products were sequenced using an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). All sequences were confirmed by sequencing both strands and all sequencing reactions were run in duplicate. Sequences were edited and aligned using Sequencher 4.2 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI).

Because these calves in the OSU studies 1-5 were cattle purchased at auction markets, these isolates likely reflect exposure to multiple sources of viruses.",

However, more recently, BoCV has been isolated in conjunction with BRD in feeder and stockyard cattle. This raises several questions. Is there is a difference between BoCV associated with enteric disease and BoCV associated with respiratory disease? Are BoCV evolving over time so that recent isolates are detectably different from reference strains isolated 50-60 years ago? Are differences between recently isolated strains and vaccine strains of practical significance?",

            "text": "Previously, the S protein coding sequences were compared from nine BoCV isolates that were isolated from dysentery cases in Korean cattle between 2002 and 2003 were compared to previously characterized BoCV strains [35] . These nine isolates were more closely related to the more recently isolated respiratory BCoV strain OK and the enteric BCoV strain LY-138 than to the prototype BoCV reference strain Mebus. They hypothesized that BoCV were evolving over time and may be diverging from an enteric tropism to a dual respiratory and enteric tropism. Similarly, Kanno et al. compared the S protein coding sequences from 55 BoCV collected in Japan from 1999 to 2000 to reference strains [33] . They concluded that these 55 isolates had distinctive genetic divergence from the prototype enteric BoCV strains (Mebus, Quebec, Kakegawa, F15 and LY138). The study reported herein expands on these observations. In addition to comparing S protein coding sequences of recent U.S. isolates to reference strains, we have also compared these strains to a vaccine strain and have conducted an antigenic comparison using convalescent sera from cattle exposed to BoCV. Our results suggest that BoCV strains currently circulating in the U.S., similar to recent Japanese and Korean strains, are divergent from prototype BoCV strains isolated, in some cases 50 to 60 years ago. Further, there are antigenic differences between these more recent strains and a prototype strain Mebus. These results are consistent with a divergence of BoCV over time. Whether this divergence is associated with an increased tropism for respiratory tissue resulting in an increased association with respiratory disease is a matter for future study. Differences in cell tropism, that result in different clinical presentations, have been observed with other coronaviruess. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) are both pathogens of swine that co-circulate in swine herds [36, 37] . TGEV replicates primarily in the enteric tract and PRCV replicates almost exclusively in the respiratory tract. In the case of porcine coronaviruses, changes in cell tropism are associated with variations of the S gene. It appears that PRCV may be a deletion mutant of TGEV [38] . In comparison to TGEV, PRCV has a large deletion in the 5 region of the S gene and minor deletions in genes 3/2a and 3-1/3b [39] . It is theorized, based on studies using TGEV mutants, that mutations located in the S gene affect tissue tropism and virulence [40, 41] .",

Another point is that these cattle in the OSU1-5 studies were found to be shedding viruses at arrival or short after arrival [19] .
