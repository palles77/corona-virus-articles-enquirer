Delayed detection and resulting widespread distributions of EVD have significantly contributed to epidemic growth. 9 Containment strategies which prioritize isolation over care can be counterproductive by discouraging sick individuals from presenting to high-mortality Ebola units. [10] [11] [12] Unreported cases occurred at higher rates during the early period of the 2013-2016 West Africa outbreak, 13 and urban transmission may also occur at a higher rate than rural transmission. 14 Change to subcritical transmission (reproduction number below 1) tends to occur when Ebola response organizations deploy control, prevention and care measures, 15, 16 communities adopt more protective behaviors, 17, 18 and/or transmission decreases in a social network. 19, 20 In the current Ebola outbreak in DRC, scientific advances with rapid diagnostics and vaccines from the West Africa outbreak has the potential to limit Ebola virus transmission as they are being deployed. [21] [22] [23] We used reported case counts from the current outbreak and/or time series from 18 prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without the use of vaccines. These projections are intended to help organizations anticipate and allocate sufficient resources to the 2018 Ebola outbreak in DRC.",

We used the Wallinga-Teunis technique to estimate R for each case and therefore for each reporting date in the outbreak. 34 The serial interval distribution used for this estimation was a gamma distribution with a mean of 14.5 days and a standard deviation of 5 days, with intervals rounded to the nearest whole number of days, consistent with the understanding that the serial interval of EVD cases ranges from 3 to 36 days with mean 14 to 15 days.",

In a ring vaccination study at the end of the West Africa outbreak, the overall estimated rVSV-vectored vaccine efficacy was 100% and vaccine effectiveness was 64.6% in protecting all contacts and contacts of contacts from EVD in the randomized clusters, including unvaccinated cluster members. 22 We designed the stochastic model using vaccine effectiveness. Then, we used past estimates of the proportion of unreported cases to estimate the proportion of exposed individuals not covered by the vaccination process. Based on a Sierra Leonean study from the 2013-2016 outbreak, 13 we estimated that the proportion of reported cases in DRC would rise over time from a low of 68% to a high of 96%. Given these low and high estimates of reported cases and the estimate of vaccine effectiveness, a low estimate of vaccination program coverage was 44% (68% * 64.6%) and a high estimate of vaccination program coverage was 62% (96% * 64.6%).

Introduction of Ebola virus into Mbandaka with its over 700,000-person population resulted in multiple transmission chains and redoubles the importance of an adequate influx of support for response team efforts to implement interventions that control and prevent the spread of EVD. While real-time modeling projections historically overestimate outbreak size and duration, 47, 48 this study exemplifies how simple mathematical models can be useful for advising real-time decision making because they provide rapid projections and similar estimates of R as compared to complex models. 49 Vaccine use, regardless of 62% or 44% coverage levels, is projected to provide a limited preventive benefit, which may be partially due to timing of implementation (after predicted peak of the epidemic curve). As such, the massive mobilization of resources to roll it out should not detract from the prioritization of patient and survivor care, lest we recapitulate the control-overcare paradigm that marred the response to the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa.

To limit epidemic growth from unreported cases, particularly those who have non-specific symptoms but are screened negative by the WHO case definition, more decentralized use of RDTs should be considered. We found that the impact of vaccines on curbing transmission would have been greater if vaccines were implemented prior to the peak of the epidemic curve (data not shown).
