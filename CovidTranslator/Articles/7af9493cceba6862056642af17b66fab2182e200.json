The sera were tested for anti-FIV antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot tests. The ELISAs were read kinetically (KELA) and the sera were retrospectively examined by PLV peptide ELISA. Eleven panthers and one cougar were positive by KELA; 4 panthers and 4 cougars were equivocal; 35 panthers and 5 cougars were negative; and 1 panther had no data. Seven of the 11 KELA-positive panthers were also positive by Western blot tests and all but one were positive by PLV peptide ELISA. Ten KELAnegative and Western blot-negative cats, were positive by PLV peptide ELISA. KELA results varied within cats from one sample period to the next, but PLV peptide ELISA results were consistent. Territorial sympatry and mating behaviour, noted from radiotelemetry location data on the cats, may have contributed to viral transmission between seropositive animals. These \u00a2ndings suggest that Florida panthers and the introduced Texas cougars have been exposed to FIV and/or PLV.",

Currently, only 30^50 individuals are thought to remain in the wild and, in an attempt to increase genetic diversity, eight female free-ranging cougars (P. c. staneleyana) from Texas were translocated into several areas of southern Florida in 1995 (Seal, 1994; Dunbar et al., 1997) .",

Feline immunode\u00a2ciency virus (FIV) and Puma lentivirus (PLV) are single-stranded RNA retroviruses of the genus Lentivirus and the family Retroviridae (Olmsted et al., 1992) . They are closely related, but enough sequence variation exists to suggest limited interspecies transmission among the felidae (Carpenter et al., 1996; Olmsted et al., 1992) . FIV-like lentiviruses have been reported to infect both domestic cats (Felis cati) and non-domestic felids including lion (Panthera leo), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), puma (P. concolor), bobcat (Lynx rufus) and \u00a3at-headed cat (Ictailurus planiceps); while PLV has been demonstrated to infect pumas (Barr et al., 1989; Carpenter et al., 1996; Olmsted et al., 1992; Kania et al., 1997) . There is great genetic diversity in the FIV infecting pumas and multiple viral subtypes are thought to exist among Florida panthers, with the possibility of co-infectivity with multiple subtypes (Carpenter et al., 1996) .",

Abnormal physical \u00a2ndings in the oral cavity or head region are the most common manifestations of clinical disease caused by FIV (Sherding, 1994) . Feline immunode\u00a2ciency virus has been shown to be shed in saliva, and transmission can occur via bite wounds; however, vertical transmission can occur during the prenatal period (in utero during acute maternal infection) or the postnatal period (via colostrum or milk-borne cellassociated virus) (Brown et al., 1993) .",

The KELA method is based on the principle that the amount of analyte (antibody) detected is directly proportional to the slope of the reaction rate between enzyme and substrate, which is visibly detected by the production of a chromogenic coloured product (Barlough et al., 1983) . The KELA reading is calibrated to reduce both within-run and between-run variability (Barlough et al., 1987) , as well as operator error or incorrect interpretation of the in-house ELISA (Barr et al., 1991) . Barr and colleagues (1991) found that, in domestic cats, the sensitivity of FIV ELISA was 0.93 and its speci\u00a2city was 0.98, but the sensitivity and speci\u00a2city were reduced to 0.79 and 0.66, respectively, for KELA equivocals, thus emphasizing the need for this classi\u00a2cation (equivocal) to reduce the number of false reports.",

Unfortunately, in some cases, sera were no longer available for testing. In general, cats testing positive or equivocal by KELA, at any one of multiple sampling times, were positive by peptide ELISA, except for 5 cats that consistently tested negative by (Table I) . This may re\u00a3ect the speci\u00a2city of the test for PLV versus FIV from domestic or other non-domestic cats. Kania and colleagues (1997) found that lentivirus-infected non-domestic felid species (cougar/Florida panther and Pallas cat) had strong reactivity with the PLV peptide but Panthera species (tiger, Siberian tiger and lion) did not. Further, Kania and colleagues (1997) found that sera from FIVpositive cats were not reactive with the PLV peptide. Therefore, cats with FIV may be negative on PLV peptide ELISA. Additionally, the Florida panther sequence used in the selection of the conserved peptide sequence was that of FP21. The only other Florida panther retrovirus sequenced is that of FP14 (mother of FP21), and the envelope sequences are identical (M. Roelke, unpublished data). Therefore high speci\u00a2city of this test is not surprising. Presumptive cross-species transmission of domestic cat FIV to a puma has been documented by sequence analysis in at least one instance (Carpenter et al., 1996) , and there are opportunities for the Florida panthers to contact domestic cats and free-ranging bobcats in their habitats. Another possibility is genetic divergence of the infecting virus in the peptide region. The PLV peptide was identi\u00a2ed from an envelope region that corresponds to a highly conserved FIV envelope region; however, the degree of conservation in this region in PLV isolates is not known. Diversity among PLV pol sequences is greater than the diversity seen in domestic cat isolates (Carpenter et al., 1996) , suggesting that the same may hold true for env sequences. Several factors probably contribute to the high number of equivocal KELA and Western blot results seen in this study. The antigens used in both assays are from domestic cat FIV isolates (KELA and some Western blots) or from a non-domestic cat isolate (FIV-Oma) that di\u00a1ers somewhat from PLV. Neither source is the ideal antigenic substrate for testing for antibodies to PLV. Thus decreased antigenic crossreaction might contribute to decreased reactivity in both assays. In addition, the Florida panthers tend to have much lower levels of antibodies produced in response to FIV infection, as compared to the response of domestic cats, and antibody levels appear to decline over time in some animals. This muted immune response to the virus contributes to the di\u00a4culty of obtaining consistently seropositive results.",

FP16 was the only positive panther that had recorded test results from 51 year of age. FP16 and its sibling FP21 were both positive by peptide ELISA at initial sample collection performed at 51 year and 1 year of age, respectively (Table I ). The source of virus exposure in these siblings is uncertain but vertical exposure is possible given that the mother (FP14) was KELA and PLV positive at the time of the siblings births. Further, FP16 had an overlapping territory and mated (M. Roelke, unpublished data) with TX105, a female Texas cougar, and may have served as the source of that cougar's positive test results. However, TX108, another mate of FP16, was negative by all tests, as was the o\u00a1spring of TX108 and FP16 (FP61).",

To date only two panthers have been documented as dying of infectious diseases, one a case of rabies and the second a case of pseudorabies (Glass et al., 1994; Taylor, 1997; Taylor et al., 2002) . These had no observed FIV/PLV-related pathological lesions. Clinical changes consistent with FIV/PLV were not observed in any other seropositive cats and, of those cats, selected haematological parameters did not appear to di\u00a1er between seropositive and seronegative panthers. In fact, the parameters for seropositive panthers were within established normal limits (Dunbar et al., 1997) . However, gross changes in haematological parameters are not commonly seen in FIV-infected cats, except in acute infection or in the \u00a2nal stages of disease (Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1997; Kohmoto et al., 1998) . Further investigation into lymphocyte ratios (CD4:CD8) as well as lymphocyte function could provide a more sensitive means of determining viral e\u00a1ects.",

The limiting factors to the peptide ELISA are that the test is not commercially available, and the targeted peptide may not be conserved in all PLV serotypes, possibly leading to false-negative results. However, an equivocal reading on KELA was often associated with a positive PLV assay and thus warrants further investigation. Additionally, the Western blot assay may clarify results when KELA test results are equivocal. We suggest that testing with two or more assays and at multiple time points might give the most reliable test results in panthers.",
