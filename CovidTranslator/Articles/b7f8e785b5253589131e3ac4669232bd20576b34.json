This space is filled by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A hallmark of meningitis is the spillover of cells into the CSF to produce an increased cell count. Meningitis is the major infectious syndrome of the central nervous system (CNS) . Meningitis can also be produced by several noninfectious causes. Sometimes involvement is more widespread than just the meninges. When meningitis is accompanied by obvious parenchymal involvement, it is more properly referred to as meningoencephalitis, meningomyelitis, or meningoencephalomyelitis.

The CNS is a sequestered organ that is confined anatomically within a bony casement.

Because the CNS lacks a fully developed and operational immune system to defend against invading pathogens, infection is harder to eradicate. It is also more difficult to deliver adequate concentrations of antimicrobials to the CNS. Because critical tissues are involved, meningitis produces unique sequelae with potentially devastating consequences. In some cases it is a true neurologic and medical emergency.",

Hemophilus influenzae was responsible for almost half of all meningitis cases and for more than 70% of infections in children younger than age 5.44,56 The epidemiology of septic meningitis changed drastically after widespread use of conjugate vaccines for H. influenzae. Meningitis caused by this agent has decreased by 94%.45 In 1986 there were a total of 12,960 septic meningitis cases in the United States. By 1995 this number had dropped by 55% down to 5755 cases a year. The median age of the typical meningitis patient over this same period rose from 15 months in the prevaccine era to 25 years in the postvaccine era. In the United States, septic meningitis shows a racial predisposition. Infection with the major bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, group B streptococcus) are significantly increased in African Americans; risks relative to non-African Americans range from 2.1 to 2.6.45 There is also epidemiologic evidence that an increasing proportion of adult meningitis is caused by nosocomial rather than community-acquired infection. A recent review of 493 cases at a Massachusetts hospital noted that nosocomial infection accounted for 28% of all cases from 1980 through 1988.15 Gram-negative bacilli accounted for 39% of nosocomial infections, compared with only 3% of community-acquired infections. During the 1960s gram negatives accounted for only 11% of all meningitis cases. By the 1980s this had increased to 24%.

There are often other useful clues to suggest specific pathogens. Staphylococcal infection is seen with indwelling catheters, shunts, endocarditis, and head trauma and after neurosurgery. Proteus species, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Flavobacterium may be pathogens when a patient is on an assisted ventilation device. L. monocytogenes infection occurs in association with diabetes, ethanol abuse, old age, and immunocompromise. Anaerobes may cause meningitis in the setting of ruptured brain abscess. Gram-negative bacterial infection occurs with head trauma and after neurosurgery, sepsis, immunocompromise, ruptured brain abscess, and systemic infection with the parasite strongyloides. S. pneumoniae infection, although the major pathogen overall, is particularly likely with pneumonia, sickle cell disease, cirrhosis, and myeloma. On rare occasions drugs can trigger meningitis, which resolves once the provoking agent is removed. This is more likely to occur in patients who have a systemic autoimmune disease. Drugs that produce meningitis include antibody preparations (intravenous immunoglobulin, monoclonal antibody infusions), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac, tolmetin), antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, isoniazid, metronidazole, penicillin, phenazopyridine, sulfonamides, trimethoprim), carbamazepine, azathioprine, and cytosine arabinoside.

Occasionally (in as much as 10% of cases), there is an initial mononuclear pleocytosis, particularly with cell counts less than 1000. Combined CSF findings that have a predictive value of 99% for bacterial meningitis are glucose less than 34 mg/dL, CSF-to-serum-glucose ratio less than 0.23, and WBC cell count higher than 2000 WBC/mm3 or polymorphonuclear count higher than 1180 WBC/mm3.49 Neuroimaging is not diagnostically useful in most cases. However, in a recent review, neuroimaging was recommended prior to lumbar puncture in patients who had coma, papilledema, or focal neurologic findings.% Neuroimaging is also obviously helpful to evaluate possible complications of meningitis. Other useful tests for the diagnosis of septic meningitis include blood cultures, which are positive for the organism in as much as half of cases. Partial treatment of bacterial meningitis (with oral antibiotics for example) decreases the positivity rates of CSF culture and Gram stain and may decrease CSF protein and neutrophil cell count. 28 With appropriate intravenous antibiotics, culture and Gram stain should become negative after 24 hours, and CSF glucose approaches normal levels in 80% of patients within 3 days. Protein and cell count are less susceptible to rapid treatment. At 1 week the cell count is still increased, but at lower levels, in 50% of patients. The protein level remains elevated for 10 or more days.",

At this stage it is important to differentiate them from patients who have acute meningitis, encephalitis, and recurrent meningitis. The typical patient who has acute meningitis, encephalitis, or recurrent meningitis presents abruptly and looks sicker than the patient with chronic meningitis. Encephalitis is marked by prominent mental status changes or focal features reflecting parenchymal involvement, with little meningismus. With the exception of acute septic meningitis, these other infection syndromes spontaneously improve within a few weeks. In contrast, the chronic meningitis syndrome may fluctuate but will not steadily improve. The CSF pattern is also helpful.

In a Mayo Clinic study of 37 chronic meningitis patients who ultimately underwent leptomeningeal biopsy, there were 2295 CSF tests, 1289 serologic tests, 401 radiologic studies, 1152 other studies, and 82 extraneural biopsies.10 Only 157 of these tests (3.3%) were abnormal. CSF was abnormal in all patients, neuroimaging was abnormal in 60%, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was abnormal in 44%. Extraneural biopsies (bone marrow) were positive in less than 4%. On the average, each patient had five lumbar punctures. The goals of the laboratory evaluation are to confirm the diagnosis and to identify the origin. Therefore the major focus is on CSF analysis. Several lumbar punctures are generally needed, and 25 mL can be removed from adults at one setting without problems. Infants and children have smaller CSF volumes; therefore less CSF should be removed.38 The yield of CSF culture, cytology, and stains is increased with large volumes and multiple samples. When lumbar CSF is unrevealing, cisternal or intraventricular CSF may be helpful. This is particularly true when there is basilar meningitis or ventriculitis. With regard to neuroimaging, contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain is the study of choice. Cultures are done not only on CSF but also on blood, urine, sputum, and occasionally, other sites. Morning urine and deep sputum samples should be obtained. At least three cultures are sent from each site. The microbiology laboratory is notified that samples are from a chronic meningitis case, so that prolonged incubations and special techniques (anaerobic culture for actinomycetes and arachnia, increased CO, for brucella, Saboraud's agar for fungi) can be used.",

Arboviruses, which are transmitted by arthropod vectors, generally cause encephalitis. However, St. Louis encephalitis virus, California encephalitis virus, and the virus of Colorado tick fever also cause meningitis. Approximately 15% of St. Louis encephalitis infections result in meningitis.4l This is especially true for children, in whom as much as 60% develop meningitis. Three California encephalitis viruses (La Crosse, Jamestown Canyon, Snowshoe Hare) cause meningitis. The agent of Colorado tick fever, which infects Dermacentor andersoni ticks, is geographically restricted to western mountainous regions. The virus infects host red blood cells and can persist within these cells for weeks after clinical recovery.",
