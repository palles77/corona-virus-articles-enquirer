Pan-anthelmintic vaccine . soil-transmitted helminth . soil-transmitted nematode . Trichinella spiralis . Trichuris muris . Trichuris trichiura Rationale for a Pan-anthelmintic vaccine The three major soil-transmitted nematode infections, in other words, ascariasis, trichuriasis and hookworm infections, are highly prevalent neglected tropical diseases that rank near the top of the list of most common human afflictions [1] . According to some estimates, approximately 800 million people are infected with the roundworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and 600 million people with the whipworm, Trichuris trichiura or hookworms, mostly by Necator americanus [1, 2] . There is widespread geographical overlap of these three soiltransmitted nematode infections (also referred to as soil-transmitted helminth, intestinal helminth, intestinal nematode or geohelminth infections) in impoverished areas of sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and South Asia and tropical regions of Central and South America [3] . Coinfections with two or even all three soil-transmitted nematode infections are extremely common in children [2, 3] . The WHO currently estimates that 874.5 million children are infected or exposed to A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura and hookworms, and therefore, require regular and periodic anthelmintic treatment ('deworming') (TABLE 1) [4] . Such children are often chronically infected and suffer from long-term disabling consequences including growth stunting, reductions in physical fitness, and cognitive and intellectual delays [2] . Moreover, there are millions of pregnant women in developing countries with soiltransmitted nematode infections, especially hookworm infection [5] . Recent estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 indicate that soil-transmitted nematode infections are responsible for 5.18 million disabilityadjusted life years, which leads all neglected tropical diseases [6] . In addition, ascariasis is responsible for 2,700 deaths annually [7] .",

It is likely that some of the factors outlined above, in other words, rapid reinfection and lack of drug efficacies, have a role in the Cochrane findings. However, the Cochrane analysis also did not differentiate between the effects of individual nematode species or their differential drug susceptibilities [8] . As an example, hookworm infection has been linked to anemia in children and adults in a systematic review, with demonstrated benefits of albendazole (but not mebendazole) on improving anemia [16] . The Cochrane analysis partly blurs these findings by treating all soil-transmitted nematode infections and their treatments as equivalent [8] . Nevertheless, the information to date indicates that there are urgencies to improve the effectiveness and efficiencies of global deworming in order to achieve key milestones and Millennium Development Goals.",

Still another approach to the global control and elimination of soiltransmitted nematode infections includes the development and distribution of anthelmintic vaccines [17] . Hookworm disease accounts for almost two-thirds of the global disease burden from soil-transmitted nematode infections [6] , so this infection was selected for initial vaccine development. Currently, the Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership is developing a bivalent recombinant protein-based human hookworm vaccine [17] . The vaccine comprises two Necator americanus antigens, Na-GST-1 and Na-APR-1, which are formulated on alum together with a second adjuvant [17] . The Na-GST-1 component is in Phase 1 clinical trials with the expectation that Na-APR-1 will follow [17] .",

A. suum is found in pigs worldwide and is closely related to A. lumbricoides. They are morphologically and antigenically indistinguishable and differ by only 4% in their mitochondrial genome sequence [18] . There is controversy in the literature about whether A. lumbricoides and A. suum should be considered separate species or as part of the same complex, and the extent to which either parasite can jump between humans and pigs [19] . The genome of A. suum has been completed [20], with A. lumbricoides to follow soon [19] , which should help to illuminate their differences. While A. suum can complete its life cycle in pigs, their large size and the costs and complexities of animal husbandry have limited the use of pigs for purposes of vaccine development. As a convenient alternative, incomplete A. suum infections can be established in mice and other rodent hosts [21] [22] [23] . Following oral administration of A. suum eggs, the released larvae migrate from the small intestine to the liver (where they create characteristic 'white spots') and lungs. As described below, experimental vaccines have been successfully developed, which can reduce the number of migrating larvae following challenge infections [21, 24] . These animal studies complement epidemiological studies conducted in human populations indicating that A. lumbricoides worm burdens in endemic areas and areas of high transmission are lower in adults than children [25] . Such observations are suggestive of possible evidence for acquired immunity.",

In parallel, a proteomics approach will be undertaken to evaluate additional ES and surface proteins from A. suum for their immunoreactivity to immune serum from the pig model as a backup strategy for identification of vaccine candidates. The goal is to rank the top two candidate antigens with respect to their efficacy in a preclinical challenge model, together with the ability to express these antigens as soluble proteins in high yield (see below).

The stichosome and its stichocytes are being explored through proteomics approaches. Both T. trichiura and T. muris follow a similar oral-fecal life cycle. Once embryonated eggs are ingested, they hatch in the small intestine. The larvae then mature and develop to adult worms in the cecum and ascending colon [49] . Different mouse strains vary in their degree of resistance or susceptibility to T. muris. The most notable strains are BALB/c (resistant) and AKR (susceptible) mice. BALB/c mice exhibit a T H 2-skewed immune protective response against T. muris, associated with elevations in host IL-4 and IgG1 [49, [51] [52] [53] . In addition to the T. muris-specific adaptive immune response, innate responses have also been identified including a multipotent progenitor type 2 cell population in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue that is induced by IL-25 and can differentiate into innate immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, mast cells and basophils [54] . Furthermore, an interesting mechanism of parasite expulsion has been linked to the aforementioned cytokine profiles. This mechanism is known as the 'epithelial escalator' in which the epithelial cells migrate from the crypt area to the top of the epithelium while bringing the parasite along with it and ultimately shedding the parasite [55] . This phenomenon appeared to be more efficient in the resistant BALB/c model compared with the susceptible AKR model [55] . Additionally, this turnover was linked to the cytokine profiles where T H 2 responses were linked to the upregulation of turnover, and T H 1 responses were correlated with downregulation of turnover [55] .",

Thus, there is still a need to discover and develop specific T. trichiura antigens. One approach could utilize the established T. muris AKR murine model. Since the adult ES products of T. muris induced complete protection in immunized mice against infective egg challenge [52] , the immune sera will be used to immunoscreen a T. muris adult stichosome cDNA library and identify secreted proteins that induce the protective immunity. Another approach to identify the vaccine antigen is to take advantage of studies already completed with the major Trichinella antigens highlighted previously. Trichuris muris orthologs of these antigens highlighted above can be cloned and expressed in platforms such as bacteria, yeast or baculovirus. These antigens can then be tested in subsequent immunogenicity studies. In parallel, proteomics approaches are useful to identify the full complement of T. muris stichosome antigens and their reactivity to immune serum from a mouse model.

In anticipation of generating a target product profile that would focus on vulnerable populations living in helminth endemic areas of low-and middle-income countries, it is likely that only low-cost expression systems such as yeast (e.g., Pichia pastoris or Hansenula polymorpha) or bacteria (e.g., E. coli) would be selected [72] . In addition to production yield, solubility and stability, the expressed proteins would be evaluated for immunogenicity and ability to induce protective immunity in the animal models highlighted above. A process will be developed for technology transfer to a current good manufacturing practices manufacturer in the USA, Europe or possibly a developing country manufacturer. Following a good laboratory practices toxicology study, an investigational new drug application would be prepared and filed with the US FDA prior to Phase 1 clinical testing. These antigens would be evaluated initially as monovalent antigens formulated on alum, possibly together with a second adjuvant such as a toll-like receptor agonist used for other vaccines under development by the Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership, such as a synthetic lipid A [73] , E6020 [74] or a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide.",

For example, the immune response to one antigen may dominate or interfere with the others in the vaccine. In endemic areas, many people suffering from helminth infections are polyparasitized [75] , making a coinfection animal model critical to vaccine development. Currently, multiple animal models are used as surrogates for human Ascaris and Trichuris infections, including rodents, pigs and nonhuman primates, with rodents and pigs used most frequently [23, 41, 42, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [76] [77] [78] . Rodent models, in other words, mice and rats, are more attractive than pigs or nonhuman primates for initial immunogenicity and efficacy studies as their small size and ease of handling allow larger numbers of animals to be evaluated concurrently. Additionally, genetically defined inbred strains allow identification of genetic backgrounds responsible for susceptibility and resistance to parasites. Several strains, including AKR, SCID and Nude, have been shown to be susceptible to T. muris, developing patent infections [49] . In contrast, while A. suum larvae migrate through the liver and lungs of C57BL/6-infected mice, to date, mice cannot support the development of adult worms, nor patent A. suum infections [79] . Nonetheless, several A. suum antigens identified by screening with immune serum from pigs have been shown to reduce lung larval burdens in susceptible mice, suggesting that protective immune responses in susceptible mice correlate with protective response in pigs [41, 42, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . Since C57BL/6 mice infected with a low dose of T. muris develop a T H 1-skewed immune response and a susceptible phenotype [80] , this mouse strain could potentially serve as an initial coinfection model for evaluating a pan-helminthic vaccine against Ascaris and Trichuris infections. Furthermore, mice would be invaluable in evaluating regulatory mandated immunogenicity testing of antigen/adjuvant combinations and future potency testing of a clinical vaccine [81] . Ultimately, to thoroughly evaluate a coformulated vaccine, both mice and pigs may be necessary to establish sufficient protection data to advance a potential vaccine candidate into product development. Pigs offer some promise as a laboratory vaccine model [82] although they have not yet been used extensively for evaluating T. suis. Further studies will be undertaken to assess whether studies confirming host protection in pigs will be on the critical path for vaccine development.",

In so doing, it may be necessary to produce a tetravalent vaccine comprising two hookworm antigens together with an Ascaris and Trichuris antigen, respectively, or even possibly a pentavalent vaccine if a second Ascaris or Trichuris antigen is required to achieve adequate protective immunity. The costs of such vaccines will have to be carefully looked at, even if only inexpensive bacterial or yeast expression vectors are employed. A cost economic modeling exercise may be required to examine the comparative advantage of a Pan-anthelmintic vaccine over current control approaches that rely on anthelmintic drugs and deworming. Previously, the Human Hookworm Vaccine was shown to be cost-effective and even cost-saving under different scenarios [75] .",

One major goal will be spearheading a focused antigen discovery program for both Ascaris and Trichuris and their eventual down-selection as detailed above. Once the antigens are identified and expressed, they will enter a process development, characterization and initial stability assessment program. A main consideration will include designing a formulation that will support stability of not only the candidate Ascaris and Trichuris antigens but also the Human Hookworm Vaccine antigens. Another key endeavor will be to build on previous preclinical studies to establish a suitable animal model for the Pan-anthelmintic vaccine. This model would support both immunogenicity and preclinical efficacy studies of our vaccine candidates, as we move toward an investigational new drug filing and clinical trials. Such studies will be critical for determining if the protective immunity achieved for these helminth antigens in laboratory animals can translate to human medicine.
