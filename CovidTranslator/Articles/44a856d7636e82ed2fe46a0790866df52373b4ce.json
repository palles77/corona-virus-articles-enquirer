Travelers may be at increased risk of certain respiratory tract infections (RTIs) due to travel itself (mingling and close quarters in airports, airplanes, cruise ships and hotels, and risk of influenza, legionella, and tuberculosis) and due to unique exposure at travel destinations (melioidosis, plague, Q fever, and coccidioidomycosis). Travel-related respiratory infections can lead to importation and secondary transmission, as occurred during the global SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in 2003, and have occurred repetitively with influenza and tuberculosis. 5, 6 This chapter reviews causative agents, clinical manifestations, and management approaches for travel-related RTIs.

            "text": "Steffen et al. estimated the monthly incidence of acute febrile RTIs to be 1261/100 000 travelers. 1 In that analysis, RTI ranked third after travelers' diarrhea and malaria among all infectious problems of travelers. However, that rate, which is equivalent to 0.2 episodes/ person/year, is much lower than the incidence of common respiratory diseases among adults in the USA, which approximates four episodes per person per year. 7 The difference is likely to be attributable to under-reporting among travelers, because a large proportion of RTIs are mild, not incapacitating, are not reported, and do not require hospital care. The incidence of RTI is similar in developing and developed nations. In a classic study comparing incidence rates in travelers to different areas, RTI occurred in 3.7/1000 travel days to Latin America, 3.5/1000 to Oceania, and 3.1/1000 to the Caribbean. 8 In the literature, there are large variations in the proportion of respiratory infections among all causes of illness in returning travelers. Comparison among studies, however, is difficult, and differences are likely to reflect diverse diagnostic procedures and definitions of syndromes rather than true epidemiologic differences. Still, RTIs consistently rank among the most frequently diagnosed and/or reported conditions among travelers. Attack rates in reported studies have ranged from 5% to 40%. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] In a large database of ill travelers from all continents within the GeoSentinel Surveillance System, Freedman described a frequency of respiratory disorders of 77 per 1000 ill returned travelers, ranging from 45/1000 in the Caribbean to 97/1000 in Southeast Asia. 2 In that analysis, respiratory disorders that prompted the seeking of medical care were less commonly reported than systemic febrile illnesses, acute diarrhea, dermatologic disorders, chronic diarrhea, and non-diarrheal gastrointestinal disorders. 2 Using the same database, Leder and colleagues found that 7.8% of ill travelers seeking medical care through GeoSentinel sites reported a respiratory illness. 16 In that series, of 1719 patients with respiratory infection, approximately 65% had an upper RTI, 75% of which were labeled as 'non-specific' and 20% were categorized as pharyngitis. Approximately 35% of all RTIs were characterized as lower tract infection, with 35% of these classified as pneumonia and over 50% being classified as bronchitis. 16 Prolonged travel, travel involving visiting friends and relatives, and travel during the northern hemisphere winter increased the likelihood of influenza and lower respiratory tract infections in this cohort. 16 O'Brien et al. studied a group of 232 sick travelers at a tertiary hospital in Australia who had largely traveled through Asian countries: RTIs were second after malaria, accounting for 24% of cases. 17 In that series, lower tract infections accounted for 50% of all RTIs, and were almost equally distributed between bacterial pneumonia and influenza. 17 Bacterial pneumonia was significantly more common in patients aged >40 years, with an odds ratio (OR) of 5.5. One-quarter of upper tract infections were due to group A Streptococcus. In a multicenter hospital study in Italy, of 541 travelers with fever, 8.1% of the 513 56 RESPiRATORy infECTiOnS \u2022 Chapter \u2022 patients had a respiratory syndrome, one-third of whom had pneumonia. TB was responsible for 29% of pneumonia cases in this cohort. Among cases with RTI and no signs of pneumonia, malaria was the underlying disease in 11 of 27. 18 In a recent analysis of GeoSentinel data on ill children after international travel, approximately 86% of ill children who were brought by their parents for medical care had four major syndromes: 28% had a diarrheal process; 25% had a dermatologic disorder; 23% had a systemic febrile illness; and 11% had a respiratory disorder. Upper respiratory tract infections (38%), hyperactive airway disease (20%), and acute otitis media (17%) accounted for the majority of the cases of respiratory syndrome in these children. 19 ",

[21] [22] [23] Sitting for a prolonged period in a confined air cabin not in flight and not with air flow can also markedly increase the risk of infection. 24 The reduced pressure of inspired oxygen found on airline flights or at high-altitude destinations may adversely affect infants' breathing patterns. 25 Respiratory and intestinal infections are the most common diagnosis for passengers and crew seeking medical care on board ships, 26 and cruise travelers are at increased risk for legionellosis, influenza, and pneumococcal disease. 4 Reasons for increased susceptibility of cruise ship travelers to respiratory infections may include contaminated ventilator-cooling systems and spas, common points-of-fomite contact (e.g., salad bars), as well as passenger factors such as age, underlying illnesses, and physical condition. 27 Infants, small children, the elderly, and subjects with chronic tracheobronchial or cardiopulmonary diseases are at increased risk of developing severe clinical consequences from RTIs.",

The sputum Gram stain is a simple, quick, and inexpensive procedure, but its helpfulness in establishing a specific etiologic diagnosis is uncertain. The utility of the sputum culture is also unclear, since the procedure is insensitive: only half of patients with pneumonia produce sputum and contamination occurs in one-third. An advantage of routine sputum Gram stain and culture is that these procedures would capture rare causes of pneumonia such as tuberculosis and melioidosis in travelers. Because the cause of pneumonia cannot be determined on the basis of any specific clinical, radiographic, or laboratory parameter, antibiotic therapy is usually begun empirically. Treatment should be effective on S. pneumoniae, the most frequently responsible agent, and on agents of atypical pneumonia: M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and legionella infections.",

No additional diagnostic procedures are required and treatment is usually supportive. The diagnosis of laryngitis is also clinical, and treatment is usually supportive. Although the diagnosis of pharyngitis is also clinical, it is important to identify individuals with pharyngitis caused by group A streptococcal infection from other causes to lessen the likelihood of subsequent sequelae, including glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever. Bacterial pharyngitis is reportedly associated with more severe pharyngeal pain, odynophagia, and higher fever, with grayish-yellow exudate on the tonsils and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. However, clinical criteria are unreliable to identify bacterial pharyngitis/tonsillitis because a typical presentation occurs in <50% of cases. Rapid antigen detection tests are available with a specificity >90% and sensitivity of 60-95%, and should generally be performed in patients ill enough to seek medical care for pharyngitis, especially in young children, in whom the risk of streptococcal disease is highest. The need to perform a bacterial culture if a rapid test is negative is debated. A treatment course with penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days is appropriate to treat pharyngitis due to S. pyogenes. Diphtheria is a rare cause of pharyngitis, with a potentially fatal outcome. It is characterized by a thick and gray pharyngeal and tracheal membrane that bleeds upon attempted removal. Diagnosis is based on clinical recognition and culture isolation of a toxigenic strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The mainstay of therapy is diphtheria antitoxin, associated with antibiotic treatment with penicillin or macrolides. Vaccination effectively eliminates the risk of travel-related pharyngeal diphtheria.",

H5N1 has resulted in millions of poultry infections, several hundred recognized human cases, and a high case-fatality rate. Human cases continue to accumulate. Currently, avian influenza H5N1 virus continues to circulate in poultry in some countries, especially in Asia and northeast Africa. In June 2011, Egypt and Indonesia confirmed their 150th and 178th human cases of avian flu, respectively. Of the 150 cases confirmed in Egypt, 52 have been fatal, compared to 146 of 178 in Indonesia. 43 Large amounts of the virus are known to be excreted in the droppings shed by infected birds. Transmission requires direct contact with birds or their droppings. Populations in affected countries are advised to avoid contact with dead birds or birds showing signs of disease. Human-to-human transmission has fortunately been very sporadic thus far, and limited to very close contacts. However, should the virus mutate to become steadily transmissible in the human community, a new deadly pandemic influenza could emerge. Human cases of avian influenza are characterized by severe pneumonia, which is frequently rapidly fatal. Evidence suggests that some antiviral drugs, notably oseltamivir, can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve survival. 44",

The incubation period is 2-5 days, but spores can germinate up to 60 days after exposure. Pathogenesis is mediated by a toxin responsible for hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis. The presenting symptoms are non-specific, with mild fever, malaise, and a non-productive cough. After a period of a few days in which the patient's condition apparently improves, a second phase begins with high fever, respiratory distress, cyanosis, and subcutaneous edema of the neck and thorax. Crepitant rales are evident on auscultation. Inhalation anthrax is almost invariably fatal with a very short time between the onset of the second phase, mediastinal signs, and death. The diagnosis of inhalation anthrax is extremely difficult outside of epidemic conditions. Direct examination and Gram stain of the sputum specimen are unlikely to be positive. A serologic ELISA test is available, although a significant increase in titer is usually obtained only in convalescent subjects who survive. The most useful bacteriologic test in case of suspicion, however, is a blood culture demonstrating B. anthracis. Treatment of inhalation anthrax should be as early as possible and usually involves a carbapenem, penicillin, doxycycline, and fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin. Ancillary treatment to sustain vascular volume, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal functions is essential.",

This rate is very similar to that of native populations in the visited countries, and much higher than the 0.01% yearly risk in The Netherlands. 72 Abubakar et al. recently provided the first evidence in the UK that travel to countries with high levels of TB infection may be an independent risk factor for acquiring LTBI. This effect was not mitigated by BCG vaccination. 73 A recent systematic review using tuberculin skin testing (TST) conversion as a surrogate for LTBI calculated the cumulative incidence of LTBI in long-term (median 11 months) travelers to be 2%, which is what could be expected among local populations in many developing countries. 74 Other factors identified for increased TB risk among travelers were: being a healthcare worker, a longer cumulative duration of travel, and a longer total time spent in TB-endemic countries. 72 Air travel itself is not considered a major risk factor for transmission of tuberculosis: only a few cases of LTBI have been associated with exposure to an infectious traveler on a plane, and no cases of active infection have been linked. 75 The risk of TB transmission on ships 76 and trains 77 has also been described, but is similarly of little epidemiologic importance.",

The radiologic finding is often that of hilar pneumonia with lymphadenitis and pleural involvement.

In an outbreak of histoplasmosis among college students from the US visiting Acapulco, 229 persons developed an acute febrile respiratory illness with cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or headache. 70 Chest X-ray may show patchy infiltrates or interstitial pneumonia. Diagnosis may be extremely difficult unless the disease is considered in the differential diagnosis, and most cases are unrecognized and considered as bacterial bronchitis Prevention guidelines state that persons with infectious TB should postpone air travel. Epidemiologic investigations for contacts of infectious passengers are indicated only within 3 months from exposure for passengers on travels of >8 h duration. 75 Travelers to high TB-endemic areas can employ behavioral modifications (individuals traveling to provide healthcare should use respiratory precautions in caring for patients with probable tuberculosis), and/or post-travel screening to assess for LTBI and evaluation for tuberculosis in individuals with a compatible disease (Fig. 56.3) .

The incidence is underestimated mainly because the majority of infections are mild and not incapacitating.

Travelers represent the primary vehicle of the yearly spread of influenza around the globe, and are critical to the global spread of new pandemics. Effective antiinfluenza vaccines exist, and all travelers should receive yearly influenza immunization and be instructed in hand-washing and cough/ sneeze hygiene. All travelers should also be up to date for other vaccines, including those that prevent RTIs, including measles, pneumococcal diseases, Hib, diphtheria, and pertussis. Clinicians caring for an ill returned traveler with an RTI should characterize the illness as upper or lower tract RTI, and consider the travel itinerary, exposure history, clinical manifestations, incubation period, and host-specific conditions.
