We report here the first case of a natural mutant and reassortant serotype 3 reovirus from mink in China, known as MRV3 SD-14. Whole-genome sequence analysis showed that the MRV3 SD-14 may have resulted from a reassortment involving MRVs that infected swine, humans and mink. Interestingly, the S1 segment, which encodes the viral attachment protein r1, which influences viral virulence and cell tropism in the host, had a stop codon mutation at amino acid 246. Surveillance of the virulence and evolution of MRVs in humans and other animals deserves more attention.",

To identify the cause of the disease, the intestinal contents were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 12000 9 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Then supernatants were filtered through a 0.22-lm filter (Pall Life Sciences) and inoculated onto an 80 % confluent monolayer of Vero and BHK cells at 37\u00b0C with 5 % CO 2 . The cells were passaged every 3 days, and a clear cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in the third passage, with Y. Zhang and Y. Liu contributed equally to this research. rounded and detached cells. Subsequently, the cells were harvested after three freeze-thaw cycles and used as viral stocks. The supernatants of medium containing viral particles were observed by negative staining electron microscopy. The observed virus particles were nonenveloped and isometric with a double-layered capsid, and they were proximately 75 nm in diameter (supplementary material). These characteristic are consistent with those of mammalian orthoreoviruses. PCR products of 400 bp were amplified using a pair of primers for the large segment (L1) and sequenced. The results of BLAST analysis (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nib.gov) showed that the sequence corresponded to the L1 segment of mammalian orthoreovirus. The complete genome sequence of 10 segments of the virus was determined using specific primers and sequenced by Comate Bioscience Co., Ltd., Changchun, China. The data were submitted to the GenBank database (accession numbers KT224504-KT224513).",

The open reading frames (ORFs) and deduced protein sequences of each segment were determined and analyzed using DNASTAR (Lasergene version 7.1). The lengths of L1-L3, M1-M3, and S1-S4 were 3854 nt, 3915 nt, 3901 nt, 2304 nt, 2203 nt, 2241 nt, 1415 nt, 1331 nt, 1198 nt, and 1196 nt, respectively, encoding k3 (1267amino acids, [aa]), k2 (1289 aa), k1 (1275 aa), l2 (736 aa), l1 (708 aa), lNS (721 aa), r1 (245 aa), r1s (120 aa), r2 (418 aa), rNS (366 aa), and r3 (365 aa) [5] . Surprisingly, the S1 segment of the MRV3 SD-14 strain contained a stop codon mutation at amino acid 246 of the r1 protein, which mediates viral binding to cellular receptors and influences target-cell selection in the infected host [5] . The stop codon mutation at amino acid 246 of the r1 protein was also found in the original animal samples. The normal S1 had two major ORFs, encoding a structural protein (r1, ORF1, 455-470 aa) and a nonstructural protein (r1s, ORF2). The S1 segment of MRV3 SD-14 strain was analyzed using DNASTAR (Lasergene version 7.1), and the results showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of r1 had only residues 1-245. Two previous studies revealed that the amino acids of r1 had only residues 1-250 or 1-252, and this did not affect viral growth [15, 16] .",
