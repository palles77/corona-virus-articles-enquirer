While bat-borne viruses are of concern to public health, investigations into their dynamics have been limited by a lack of longitudinal data from individual bats. Here, we examine capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data from a species of Australian bat (Myotis macropus) infected with a putative novel Alphacoronavirus within a Bayesian framework. Then, we developed epidemic models to estimate the effect of persistently infectious individuals (which shed viruses for extensive periods) on the probability of viral maintenance within the study population. We found that the CMR data analysis supported grouping of infectious bats into persistently and transiently infectious bats. Maintenance of coronavirus within the study population was more likely in an epidemic model that included both persistently and transiently infectious bats, compared with the epidemic model with non-grouping of bats. These findings, using rare CMR data from longitudinal samples of individual bats, increase our understanding of transmission dynamics of bat viral infectious diseases.",

Examples include the coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which claimed 916 lives out of 8422 cases from November 2002 to August 2003 [2] , and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which has claimed 608 lives out of 1449 cases as of 31 August 2016 [3] . SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) are maintained in bats [4] , and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is assumed to have originated in bats [5] . The findings that genetically diverse SL-CoV strains share high similarity with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and that bats harbour diverse coronaviruses which can be classified to the same coronavirus species as MERS-CoV suggest that recurrent coronavirus epidemics and pandemics in humans are likely [6] . Genetic analyses of coronaviruses in bats suggested that the diversity of coronaviruses in bats may provide further opportunities for spillover into other species [7] . Mitigation of spillover of the viruses is based on understanding of the maintenance mechanism of multihost viruses in reservoir hosts.",

This feature of bats may contribute to their ability to host zoonoses, including SARS, MERS, Ebola, Marburg, Nipah and Hendra viruses. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this: some authors suggest that bats' ability to fly induces fever, helping to control viruses [9] ; others suggest that immune system adaptation allows tolerance of intracellular pathogens [10] and that co-evolution during a long history between specific viruses and bat hosts results in no pathogenicity to bats whereas recent host shifts from bats to other mammals result in high fatality rates [11, 12] .",

This paper concentrates on the first of these conditions. Features that may contribute to viral maintenance in bat populations include: (1) a metapopulation structure that avoids viral extinction across the total population via sub-populations, which allow reinfection through movement [13, 14] ; (2) reduced metabolism during hibernation that facilitates viral survival [15] ; and (3) persistent infections with chronic shedding or intermittent recrudescence [16, 17] . This study focuses on the feature of persistent infection. Persistent infections of SARS-CoV in vitro studies support the plausibility of persistent infections of coronaviruses in bats [18, 19] . In persistent infections, a virus is not cleared from the host but remains associated with specific cells for a long period. Regardless of the mechanisms operating within hosts, persistent infection contributes to viral maintenance within populations and has been considered as a mechanism of viral maintenance in reservoir hosts of other emerging infectious diseases [20] .",

            "text": "Smith undertook a CMR study of M. macropus in the lifting holes of a bridge in southeast Queensland, Australia (Supplementary Table S1 ) [21] . Full details of the methodology are described in the original study [21] . Briefly, the CMR data of 52 Australian bats (M. macropus) were collected during nine capturing occasions over 12 weeks from 13 January to 31 March 2009, which overlapped with the January breeding season and subsequent lactation period for this species [21] . Coronavirus RNA was detected in faecal pellets or anal swabs using RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) targeting a conserved region of a coronavirus gene [21] . Of the 52 unique individuals, 42 were recaptured at least once, and of these, 7, 16 and 19 bats respectively showed multiple detections, a single detection, and no detection of coronavirus RNA ( Table 1 ). The data from bats with multiple detections of coronavirus RNA were suggestive of persistent infections [21] . The CMR dataset are unusual and particularly valuable in that the data contain individual tracking records with infection states. Longitudinal sampling of individual bats is necessary to explore persistent infection and to test whether persistent infection is a possible viral maintenance mechanism in a bat population. For many bats, large population size and migratory behaviour have impeded obtaining individual data. Most field studies have therefore been crosssectional [14, 23, 24] rather than following individuals through time, limiting development of understanding the maintenance mechanism of bat-borne viruses.",

From Drexler et al.'s study [14] and from observation of the CMR data [21] , Smith [21] hypothesised that the initial epidemic peak was caused by the formation of a maternity roost of M. macropus from weeks 1 to 6, and that a second epidemic peak, after parturition, was caused by newborn pups who lost their passive immunity from weeks 6 to 12. Thus, with an assumption that a new epidemic began from week 7, we used an equation of R 0 = 1 + \u039bD [31] , where \u039b represents the growth rate in an epidemic and D represents the average duration of the infectious period. We calculated \u039b as 0\u00b73328 per week by using the CMR data from weeks 7 to 12 (Supplementary figure S1). We estimated mean D as 1\u00b77737 weeks, from the infectious period of recaptured bats (1/\u03b3) ( Table 2) . Thus, we estimated R 0 to be 1\u00b75903. We estimated \u03b2 using R 0 = \u03b2ND, where N is the total population size [31] . By assuming that N was 86 (the mean estimated size of the study population [21] ) we could calculate \u03b2, 0\u00b70104. A rate of waning immunity (\u03c9) was unable to be estimated from this CMR data and has not been estimated in other studies. In the absence of data to suggest otherwise, we assumed the rate of waning immunity was comparable to that in human SARS-CoV infections [30] . Uncertainty in parameter values was included by sampling mortality and recovery rates from PERT distributions using the R package 'mc2d' [32] .",

Further, the number of bats in the roost was relatively small and this would allow homogenously mixed contacts among bats [21] . We used a SIRS model for coronavirus infection in bats, following previous authors, who have used SIRS models for coronavirus infection in Miniopterus spp. [21] . Additionally, high SARS-CoV seroprevalence in bats supports the existence of a recovered class [4] .

This result showed that viruses were more likely to be maintained in the bat population when bats could either be persistently infectious or transiently infectious than when bats were not split into these groups.

Transition probabilities are probabilities that bats transit between infectious state and non-infectious state.

Grouping of bats into persistently infectious bats and transiently infectious bats was supported by the CMR multistate model selection processes (Table 3) . By exploring various scenarios in epidemic models, we found that population-level viral persistence was marginally more probable when infectious periods were heterogeneous (bats were either transiently or persistently infectious; Table 4 ). In addition to a previous study that suggested persistent infection of coronavirus in bats in North America through the small number of bats sampled [23] , our study provides much validity by using larger number of bats sampled [21] , although the sample size is still not large enough to provide robust estimates. Further understanding of the potential and likelihood of within-host persistent infections is important to understand spillover of bat-borne viruses. Persistent infections contribute not only in maintaining viruses in a population but also in triggering pulses of virus shedding. Temporally synchronised stressors such as food shortage and reproduction may weaken the immune system of bats, facilitating persistent infections in infectious bats [38] . Thus, those temporally synchronised stressors can cause viral shedding from persistently infectious bats during a limited period, leading to pulses of viral shedding. Because spillover of bat-borne viruses has been associated with pulses of viral shedding from bats [38] , the finding of persistent infection in bats contributes in understanding spillover mechanisms of bat-borne viruses.",

Scenarios differed in the infectious period estimate used: scenario 1 and 2 used estimates from the CMR analyses (reciprocal of recovery rates (\u03b3), which are shown in Table 2 ), whereas scenarios 3-6 explored a series of hypothetical persistently infectious periods. The infectious period for transient infections was constant for all two-group scenarios (based on 1/\u03b3 t ), but the infectious period for persistent infections was varied. Specifically, scenario 2 used 1/\u03b3 p from the CMR analyses for persistently infectious period, whereas in scenarios 3-6, we assumed 5, 7, 9 and 11 weeks of persistently infectious periods respectively. * Scenario 1 used the same recovery rate for all bats.

These findings need to be treated with some caution, because the low sample size limits our confidence in the results of modelling. For example, the recapture rates were markedly different from recapturing occasion to occasion (Fig. 1a) , as only one bat was sampled at the fifth recapturing occasion [21] . Additionally, the CMR data included only coronavirus RNA detections, without detections of coronavirus antibodies. A SARS coronavirus crude antigen ELISA was not successful in detecting antibodies against the putative novel Alphacoronavirus in these bats [21] . Thus, the lack of seroprevalence in the CMR data limited the accuracy of the estimated duration of recovery. Nevertheless, the CMR data deserve intensive analyses because longitudinal sampling of individual bats for infectious diseases is difficult to achieve and allows estimation of epidemiological parameters. The CMR study in Smith's study [21] had relatively high recapture rates thanks to finding a lifting hole of a bridge where bats, infected with coronavirus, roosted with a high affinity to their colony. Fluctuating recapture rates across capturing occasions in the CMR data, which might be associated with trap-shy and adaptive methods of capturing, highlighted the difficulty of recapturing specific bats during the entire sampling period.",

It was also hypothesised that a small portion of super-long-shedder bats with a long infectious period could maintain Hendra virus in a bat population [13] . Although further comprehensive datasets are needed to understand the effects of persistent infection, this study shows the value of longitudinal individual data from bats with viral infections to elucidate transmission dynamics of bat-borne viruses, underscoring the need of individual bat tracking data with infection states to improve our understanding of infection dynamics of bat-borne viruses.",
