While we have gained a great amount of knowledge in microcantilever bending due to surface stress changes, which is a unique property of microcantilever sensors, we are still in the early stages of understanding the fundamental surface chemistries of surface-stress-based microcantilever sensors. In general, increasing surface stress, which is caused by interactions on the microcantilever surfaces, would improve the S/N ratio, and subsequently the sensitivity and reliability of microcantilever sensors. In this review, we will summarize: A) the conditions under which a large surface stress can readily be attained, and B) the strategies to increase surface stress in case a large surface stress can not readily be reached. We will also discuss our perspectives on microcantilever sensors based on surface stress changes.",

These bending amplitudes were measured from microcantilevers of different sizes and compositions. For comparison, we converted all the bending amplitude data to surface stresses according to Equations 1 and 2. For consistency, the following parameters have been used in all of the calculations: Poisson's ratio \u03bd = 0.2152 and Young's modulus E =156 GPa for silicon, 70 GPa for SiO 2 , and 300 GPa for Si 3 N 4 . A 0.1 N/m surface stress corresponds to 60 nm of bending of a Si cantilever with the dimensions of 200 \u03bcm in length and 1 \u03bcm in thickness. It should be noted that surface stress is a general term used to elucidate the cause of microcantilever bending. In general, surface stress is a result of intermolecular interactions on the surface (such as electrostatic repulsion and/or attraction, steric effects, or hydration), changes in the volume of the coating, or thermal expansion differences between the two surfaces of the microcantilevers. When the coating is thicker, the film stress should be expressed with the same units as pressure (N/m 2 ). 24, 25 To avoid confusion, we will not show the quantities for the surface stress change when a thicker coating was used, but simply address that the bending amplitude was large. This is based on the fact that the bending amplitude is our concern and that the bending amplitudes of all the thicker-film-coated microcantilevers were large. It should also be noted that some publications were not cited in this review because it is not possible to convert the only reported signals, which were in units of voltage, to surface stress without further information.",

In general, chemical reactions on the catalytic surface produce enough heat to generate a large surface stress, such as a 4.5 N/m surface stress as a result of the reaction H 2 + O 2 \u2192 H 2 O 1 , and a 1.5 N/m surface stress change from the oxidation of ethanol on a TiO 2 surface. 26 A significant difference in thermal expansion between the two layers (such as Si and Al) of the microcantilevers is critical for a larger surface stress change. 1, 27 The surface stress caused by catalytic reactions can be enhanced with optimized microcantilever structures and thermal expansion materials, such as a polymer-metal-ceramic trilayer. 28",

The cantilever responds to the lateral pressure exerted by an ensemble of reorienting ferrocenium-bearing alkylthiolates stacked upon each other.

So far, all of the DNA hybridizations have resulted in surface stresses less than 0.1 N/m, 91 which inhibit the microcantilever sensors from being a viable technology for practical applications. It is often assumed that surface conjugation chemistries utilized by other chip-based microsensors can be transferred to microcantilever devices; however, the mechanism of surface stress induced bending is substantially different from the mechanisms of other sensor platforms such as fluorescence or surface plasmon resonance. Simulation and modeling experiments predict theoretical surface stress on microcantilevers that are much more than the experimentally determined values. 92 Much of the gap between actual and theoretical values is likely due to non-ideal surface characteristics, including gold surface characteristics, surface packing, orientation of the receptor on the surface, the degree of interaction between the receptors on the surface, changes in receptor conformation and receptor-analyte interactions, etc. Surface packing and orientation can be altered with different surface characteristics and conjugation chemistries. Orientation and surface packing will also affect molecular interactions on the surface. If there is special treatment of the surface and the receptor layer is perfectly immobilized on the surface with both high density and order, the surface stress generated will be in better agreement with the simulated data, thus producing larger bending responses.",

In one example, 84 microcantilevers modified by anti-feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) antibody using succinic anhydride did not yield reproducible results for feline coronavirus detection. The poor quality of these cantilevers was determined to be caused by inconsistent surface modification. The consistency and the surface stress were greatly improved when the surface was prepared with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS).

Unwanted aggregating particles can form on the amino and carboxyl topped thiol monolayers on the gold surfaces.

It is expected that an increased surface area produces a larger number of binding sites and confinement of the molecules in nanocavities, increasing the intermolecular forces such as the solvation, steric, osmotic, and hydration forces with respect to flat surfaces. On the other hand, discontinuities in the gold surface prevents the generated surface stress from being efficiently transferred to the cantilever beam. As a result, reports on this issue from different labs were not consistent, as some reports supported this hypothesis, 102, 103, 104, 105 while others 100, 106, 107, 108, 109 showed that processed porous silicon surfaces or rough surfaces do not introduce significant static bending of the cantilevers. The poor reproducibility of these studies between different laboratories may be due to differences in the surface properties and the chemistries, such as the degree of roughness or the pore size. In particular, the role of the gold film has not been paid much attention until recently, a topic which will be discussed in the next subsection.

These characteristics include the adhesion 100, 110 (so that the surface stress in the sensing film can be transferred to the cantilever substrate), the surface morphology (e.g., grain size, grain boundaries, film roughness, crystallographic orientation, discontinuity), and the cleanliness of the gold sensing surface, which can have both qualitative and quantitative effects on the measured surface stress. It is therefore essential to characterize how these factors affect the sensor response. Gold surfaces could be prepared using two approaches: thermal evaporation or sputtering. The magnitudes of the surface stresses caused by the same interactions on gold surfaces that are prepared with these two different approaches are significantly different from each other. 109 showed that the kinetics of SAM formation and the resulting SAM structures are strongly influenced by the surface structure of the underlying gold substrate (Figure 7) . Particularly, the adsorption onto gold surfaces having large, flat grains produces high-quality SAMs. An induced compressive surface stress of 15.9 \u00b10.6 N/m results when a c(4\u00d72) dodecanethiol SAM forms on gold. However, the SAMs formed on small-grained gold (with grain sizes smaller than 100 nm) are incomplete and have an induced surface stress of only 0.51\u00b10.02 N/m. The progression to a fully formed SAM with alkyl chains adopting a vertical (standing-up) orientation is clearly inhibited in the case of small-grained gold substrates and is promoted in the case of largegrained gold substrates.",

Kadam et al. 111 studied the Hg sensing behavior of microcantilevers that were modified with as-deposited sputtered and thermally evaporated Au film. For sputtered films, the deflection response of the microcantilever always stabilizes after the Hg is turned off, whereas for thermally evaporated films there is an exponential decay after the Hg exposure is stopped.

As shown in section A, numerous cases showed that microcantilevers coated with thicker films generated large bending on sorption analytes. Microcantilevers with thicker coatings do not require a high maintenance of the surface characteristics of microcantilevers, but mainly rely on the properties of the materials of the coating. The materials of these films are mostly polymers, such as hydrogels, polymer brushes, porous polymers, metal organic complexes, 113 etc. Several recent publications 114, 115 have shown that microcantilevers modified by these polymers could be quite promising if applied to biosensing. Along this line, it is expected that a film of dentrimers could also provide the solution, although dentrimers have not yet been applied to microcantilevers. The negative consequence of this new polymer film approach is that there would be a longer response time due to the diffusion of the analytes into the film. It should be noted that although all of the thick-film modified microcantilevers showed large bending and were out of the focus of this review, several aspects, such as the viscoelastic effect, of these coatings, should be paid serious attention in order to develop reliable sensors. Even though large bending is a necessity, it does not guarantee reproducible and reliable sensing. This has been discussed in more detail in another review paper. 116 Besides a thicker film coating, another possibility, based on binding or interaction, could induce a significant change in the substrate, such as collapse, phase change, or polarization change of the substrates. Like the thicker film coating, this also does not require high maintenance of the surface characteristics.",
