            "text": "Isatis indigotica Fortune is a popular herb in traditional Chinese medicine, and various types of metabolites are the basis for its pharmacological efficacy. The biosynthesis and accumulation of these metabolites are closely linked to nitrogen availability; the benefits of low nitrogen application on the environment and herb quality are increasingly prominent. To analyze metabolic changes in the leaves and roots of I.indigotica in nitrogen deficiency conditions, and to identify the pathways and metabolites induced by low nitrogen availability, we used untargeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TripleTOF) to obtain metabolomics profiling of I.indigotica under two N-deficiency treatments (0 kg/hm 2 ; 337.5 kg/hm 2 ) and normal nitrogen treatment (675 kg/hm 2 ). A total of 447 metabolites were annotated. Principal component analysis separated the three nitrogen treatments. A greater diversity of metabolites was observed in roots than in leaves under Ndeficiency treatments, suggesting that roots have a more important function in low N tolerance. Differential metabolites were mainly enriched in purine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway, tryptophan metabolism, and flavonoid biosynthesis that notably induced only in leaves in low nitrogen stress. Moderate N-deficiency benefits carbohydrate accumulation, whereas accumulation of most amino acids decreases. Uniquely, L-tryptophan was maintained at a high concentration in N-deficiency conditions. Low nitrogen stress induced the accumulation of some specialized metabolites (matairesinol, dictamnine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (serotonin) in roots and vitexin, xanthohumol, sinapyl alcohol in leaves). N-deficiency also increased the accumulation of adenosine and quality indicators of I.indigotica (indirubin-indigo, epigoitrin and anthranilic acid) in a certain degree. Our findings showed that nitrogen deficiency modified roots and leaves conditions of I.indigotica, affecting both the primary and secondary metabolism. Moderate nitrogen reduction was beneficial to the accumulation of active ingredients. Our methods and analysis are expected to provide an insight regarding the diversity of metabolites and regulation of their synthesis in low nitrogen application, and better investigate the nitrogen deficiency effect on I.indigotica.",

Nitrogen affects both the final yield through the primary metabolism of plants and the quality through secondary metabolism, especially for medicinal plants, in which secondary metabolites are active components for preventing and treating human disease (Dai et al., 2010) . However, the application of nitrogen fertilizer is not always efficient; plants are able to convert only 30-40% of applied nitrogen to useful products (Kant et al., 2011; Tilman et al., 2002) . Residual nitrogen will pollute soil and water by volatilization, leaching, surface runoff and microbial consumption, thereby causing important ecological problems (Good and Beatty, 2011) . Therefore, lowering nitrogen fertilizer input and improving the efficiency of nitrogen use are major aims in many agronomic and physiological studies (Hirel et al., 2007; Lea and Azevedo, 2006) .",

In addition, a variety of nutrient deficiencies in plants is characterized by an accumulation of specialized metabolites, and numerous studies have reported a positive correlation between low nitrogen availability and secondary metabolism in plants. Arabidopsis and tomato exhibit significant inverse relationships between nutrient availability and flavonoids accumulation, with nitrogen limitation promoting the greatest increase in flavonoids (Stewart et al., 2001) .

(2015) reported that plants accumulate a large amount of sugar in the early stages of aging in low nitrogen stress, a condition which is obviously manifested as carbon-nitrogen imbalance. In addition, more sucrose is transported to the roots and it is involved in the root growth regulation, whereby the roots provide carbon sources and energy to plants in stressful conditions (Krapp et al., 2011) . In this research, we found statistically differences in carbohydrate levels in Isatis roots. ADP-glucose, maltotriose and glycogen were found in relatively high concentrations in RN-h. L-arabinose abundance was significantly altered in roots and leaves. L-arabinose is an important constituent of Radix Isatidis polysaccharide (RIPS) (Jia et al., 2016) . Interestingly, in this study, levels of L-arabinose were high in N-deficient treatments in Isatis leaf, which the trend was opposite to that in roots. L-arabinose is a good carbon source in plants, and it has a key function in nitrogen-fixation (Novick and Tyler, 1982) .Thus, we speculate that the changes in L-arabinose abundance were related to up-regulation in carbohydrate synthesis of Isatis leaf under low N conditions.",

We found that the abundances of L-citrulline, L-proline and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine were significantly changed in roots; the contents showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing with a decrease in nitrogen availability. Amino acid content is closed related to nitrogen, yet some amino acids also act as regulators to alleviate abiotic stress (Dietz and Sharma, 2006) .According to a study on Arabidopsis, L-citrulline produces N compounds in specific tissues to serve as endogenous N sources for growth (Ludwig, 1993) . L-proline is related to plant cell osmotic regulation in stress conditions (Singh et al., 2002) . L-glutamate and Ltryptophan in leaves showed an opposite trend. An increase in L-tryptophan content in N-deficiency conditions is probably associated with amino acids acting synergically to mitigate N-deficiency damage of plants. Purine metabolism is part of nitrogen metabolism, and the relative metabolites synthesis is closely linked to nitrogen availability (Ma et al., 2016) . We found that the abundances of adenosine, deoxyadenosine and hypoxanthine were significantly different both in roots and leaves. Only adenosine accumulated in N deficiency. Adenosine is a principal nucleoside in I.indigotica, which has the effect of enhancing immunity (Zuo et al., 2007) .The accumulation of adenosine may be related to purine metabolism acting to regulate nitrogen and reactive .

We found the differential metabolite related to the shikimate acid pathway was dopamine, and dopamine content in the LN-n group was significantly higher than that in the low-nitrogen group in leaves. Dopamine is an intermediate for the synthesis of alkaloids and its synthesis is closely linked to tyrosine.

In addition, tryptophan metabolism is closely related with the biosynthesis of indole alkaloids in several plants, such as Arabidopsis and I.indigotica (Maugard et al., 2001) . Here we found that the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) in roots was higher in low nitrogen treatments (Table 1) . Being synthesized from tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptamine has a vital function in tryptophan metabolism to alleviate biotic and abiotic stress (Ishihara et al., 2008) .

Analogously, specialized metabolic pathways such as phenylpropanoids biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway, tryptophan metabolism and flavonoid biosynthesis were induced to adapt to the low-N conditions. Carbohydrate content was maintained at high levels in medium-nitrogen deficiency. The different distribution of L-arabinose between roots and leaves may be related to low-N tolerance. Severe and medium nitrogen treatments were negatively correlated with the accumulations of most amino acids, whereas L-tryptophan accumulated under low-N stress. The contents of L-proline and L-citrulline showed steep increases in severe-N treatment compared with medium-N treatment, a response which may be related to their special functions in alleviating cell damage.

Most of these metabolites have been validated to have pharmacological activities, and presumably be the potential medicinal constituents of I.indigotica. Quality indicators: indirubin-indigo, epigoitrin and anthranilic acid were negatively correlated with nitrogen level, and their concentrations were maintained relatively high in low nitrogen treatments. Similarly, vitexin notably accumulated in LN-z and LN-h. Vitexin and isovitexin are the main active-flavonoids in I.indigotica.
