The Strategy calls for collective responsibility and actions to address the shared regional health security threat with a greater emphasis on preparedness-driven investments in health security.

Many countries have invested in enhancing their fundamental public health surveillance and response systems. Various new programmes, projects and networks related to emerging diseases have also been initiated with the involvement of national governments, international organizations, development agencies, donors and partners (including the private sector) and academic or educational institutions. These efforts have helped improve the overall preparedness for emerging diseases in the region and globally. 12 The experiences and lessons learnt from implementation of the original Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases, or APSED (2005), and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 showed a clear need for harmonization, prioritization, coordination, collaboration and efficiency in addressing the common threats. Such a collective approach required an up-to-date, agreed upon strategic framework that is relevant to all countries, regions and international stakeholders. The World Health Organization (WHO), as the directing and coordinating agency for international health within the United Nations system, has played an essential role in developing such global and regional public health policies and strategies in consultation and collaboration with countries and areas, technical experts and partners. Global and regional strategies can be tailored for national use based on country and area needs and context.",

The substantially revised International Health Regulations, or IHR (2005), serve as a legal instrument to ensure global health security through a collective approach. 13 Global health security depends on all countries being well equipped to detect, assess, report and respond to any public health events that threaten health security. As infectious diseases do not respect national borders, there is recognition that no single country alone -no matter how capable, wealthy or technologically advanced -can prevent, detect and respond to all acute public health threats. Effective regional and international surveillance and response systems are vitally important to ensure health security for all. Within this collective defence system for health security, WHO has several comparative advantages, including its ability and mechanisms to work with countries and areas to develop health policies, strategies and standards and to connect global experts and technical resources through networks such as the National IHR Focal Points, the WHO Collaborating Centres, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and the Global Influenza Surveillance Network.",

It is a three-in-one strategy to help countries: (1) strengthen the generic capacities for managing emerging diseases, (2) improve pandemic readiness, and (3) build up to meet the IHR core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. APSED (2005) identified five programme areas as priorities for national capacity-building, namely surveillance and response, laboratory, zoonoses, infection control and risk communication. Through the collective efforts of countries and areas, WHO and partners, considerable progress has been made in all five APSED (2005) capacity areas. For example, most countries have now established event-based surveillance systems to detect public health events including disease outbreaks. Trained rapid response teams (RRTs) are able to conduct field investigations quickly. The capacities of the national influenza centres have been significantly improved. These capacities were tested through a realworld global public health event -Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The pandemic response clearly demonstrated the value of regional investment in capacity-building. 15 The 2005 Strategy has been recently revised in response to requests from countries and areas following recent developments and evolving needs. The updated Strategy, now called the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (2010), also known as APSED (2010), was endorsed at the sixty-first Session of the Regional Committee for the Western Pacific in October 2010. 16 It builds on the experiences and accomplishments gained from implementing APSED (2005) and takes into account the key lessons learnt from the pandemic response, the needs expressed by countries and areas and the technical advice provided by experts during the intensive country and regional-level consultations between July 2009 and October 2010. Table 1 shows the similarities and differences between APSED (2005) and APSED (2010). APSED (2010) aims to build sustainable national and regional capacities and partnerships to ensure public health security through preparedness planning, prevention, early detection and rapid response to emerging diseases and other public health emergencies. It calls for collective responsibilities and actions of countries and areas, WHO and partners to ensure a safer and more secure Region.",
