Since B cells are activated also by CD40 ligand (CD40L) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists via a similar signaling pathway, it is likely that costimulation through these molecules could result in synergistic enhancement of the transformation efficiency of EBV. In this study, the stimulatory effect of TLR7/8 (R848), TLR9 (CpG) agonists and/or CD40L on transformation efficiency of EBV in normal human B cells was assessed using the limiting dilution assay. Costimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with CpG and R848, but not CD40L, increased significantly the frequency of EBV transformed B cells (p \\ 0.001). Neither synergistic nor additive effects were observed between TLR agonists and CD40L and also TLR7/8 and TLR9 agonists. Costimulation with R848, CpG and CD40L enhanced the proliferative response of B cells infected with EBV. This effect was more evident when enriched B cells were employed, compared to PBMCs. The promoting effect of TLR agonists stimulation, implies that EBV may take advantage of the genes induced by the TLR stimulation pathway for viral latency and oncogenesis.",

            "text": "In a recent study CD19 and BCR co-ligation has been shown to promote EBV transformation and establishment of LCLs (Hur et al. 2005) . However, little is known about the synergistic effects of CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L) interaction and TLR engagement on the efficiency of transformation. CD40 ligation of B cells infected with EBV leads to promotion of viral latency by control of EBV reactivation through downregulation of BZLF-1 which is considered as the major viral activator of lytic EBV replication (Adler et al. 2002) . Moreover, it was shown that EBV infection can induce CD40L expression in B cells which is considered critical for transformation and survival of infected cells (Imadome et al. 2003) . However, controversial findings have been reported indicating that CD40 ligation can restrain the growth of EBV-transformed LCLs by switching the viral transcription program from the full lymphoblastoid to a more limited latency program (Pokrovskaja et al. 2002) . Full activation of B cells infected with EBV also can be triggered endogenously by direct recognition of EBV related pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) via TLR2 (Gaudreault et al. 2007 ), TLR7 (Martin et al. 2007 ) and TLR9 (Guggemoos et al. 2008; Gargano et al. 2009 ), under physiological conditions, or exogenously by other microbial components at the sites of EBV infection (Stenfors and Raisanen 1993; Iskra et al. 2010) . Recently, it has been shown that triggering TLR9 and probably other components of the innate immune system inhibits switch of latent EBV infection to lytic replication and promotes EBV-driven B cell transformation and tumor development (Ladell et al. 2007 ). This supports the observation that TLR9 agonists (unmethylated CpG containing oligonucleotides) can enhance synergistically the efficiency of transformation of peripheral memory B cells by EBV (Traggiai et al. 2004) . The promoting effects of the other TLR agonists, especially TLR7/8 and CD40L on B cell transformation have not been studied extensively. In this study, the potential promoting effects of TLR9 and TLR7/8 agonists and CD40 ligation, alone or in combination, on EBV-driven B cell proliferation and transformation was investigated based on limiting dilution assay (LDA).",

Culture medium contained 1 lg/ml of cyclosporin A to prevent the regression of immortalized EBV-infected cells by EBV-specific memory T lymphocytes in seropositive individuals. Following 3 weeks, the frequency of transformation was evaluated based on the number of wells containing growing transformed B cells. Using the standard EBV transformation protocol in normal peripheral PBMCs, we and others (Chang et al. 2006 ) have already shown that transformed B cells are established within 3-5 weeks after EBV infection. In the present study we employed an improved transformation protocol using irradiated fetal fibroblast feeder cells and tenfold concentrated EBV stock which accelerates the transformation process (data not presented).

PBMCs and enriched B cells were infected with EBV (as described above) and seeded separately at 250, 500 and 1,000 (for PBMCs) or 30, 60 and 120 (for enriched B cells) cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates. These cell densities were selected based on a pilot study on a number of normal individuals to enable analysis of EBV transformation frequency. Each cell density was distributed into 20 wells. The frequency of transformed B cells in PBMCs was evaluated based on the Poisson statistical analysis taking into consideration the percentage of B cells in PBMCs which was determined by flow cytometry using FITC-conjugated anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). The emergence of LCLs was evaluated following the first week and the actual number of wells that were positive and negative for the presence of growing LCLs in each plate was determined microscopically starting from the third week of infection. The data were transferred to a semilogarithmic graph on which the x-and y-axes represent dilution of cells and the negative fraction, respectively. A bestfit line was constructed based on the experimental data for each donor. This analysis shows that at a cell dilution where 37 % of wells are negative for growing LCLs (negative fraction = 37 %) there is, on average, one precursor B cell in each well (Yarchoan et al. 1983 ). Afterward, the efficiency of EBV transformation in PBMCs was estimated based on the Poisson statistical analysis formula by determination of negative fraction and percentage of B cells in the PBMCs population as described previously (Yarchoan et al. 1983; Pasha et al. 2004 ).",

Costimulation with CpG or R848 boosted the proliferative response of PBMCs infected with EBV by a mean of twofold (p = 0.2) and B cells infected with EBV by a mean of 2.4-and 2.7fold, respectively (p = 0.07), but this increase did not reach statistical significance most likely due to variation within samples and the small sample size. Enriched B cells collected from five healthy subjects were infected with EBV and costimulated with TLR agonists or CD40L and seeded at three different cell densities (120, 60 and 30 B cells/well). The mean data points obtained for the three cell densities of B cells infected with EBV in presence or absence of TLR agonists or CD40L are depicted on each line Costimulation with CD40L enhanced the stimulation index of the B cells and PBMCs infected with EBV, but the difference was statistically significant only for B cells (p = 0.01).",

Addition of TLR7/8 (R848) or TLR9 (CpG) agonists at the time of EBV infection improves significantly the efficiency of transformation in PBMCs and enriched B cells infected with EBV (p \\ 0.001) (Figs. 1 and 2) leading to threefold increase for CpG and 6.2-fold increase for R848 of clonal outgrowth of B cells infected with EBV based on limiting dilution assay (Fig. 4) . This promoting effect was more evident, particularly after CD40L costimulation, when enriched B cells were used instead of PBMCs which implies induction of other immune effector cells within PBMCs by TLR agonists and CD40L. Potential activation of these cells, including monocytes, NK cells and dendritic cells through TLR7/8 and 9 and monocytes and dendritic cells through CD40L may result in secretion of inflammatory mediators and type I anti-viral interferons (IFN-I), which confer antiviral state to B cells, leading to a lower transformation rate of B cells infected with EBV (Megyeri et al. 1995; Tomai et al. 1995; Roda et al. 2005 ). In addition, stimulatory effect of CpG, may arm natural killer (NK) cells to eradicate B cells infected with EBV (Sivori et al. 2004; Roda et al. 2005) .",

            "text": "Costimulation with CD40L plus TLR agonists did not improve the transformation efficiency of EBV ( Figs. 1 and 3 ). This part of results indicates that synergism between CD40L/TLR or TLR/TLR signaling, which has been reported in several studies (Wagner et al. 2004; Napolitani et al. 2005; Roelofs et al. 2005; Ma et al. 2007; Ahonen et al. 2008) , is not a predetermined property and may fluctuate in different biological conditions. Indeed, the effect of TLR agonists was weakened by the addition of CD40L, though the difference was not statistically significant. The lower B cell transformation efficiency induced by the combination of TLR agonists and CD40L as compared to TLR agonists alone could be attributed to some differences observed in their signaling pathways. Activation of IRF3 and IRF7 via MyD88 or TRIF requires TRAF3 (Oeckinghaus et al. 2011 ). Thus, TRAF3-deficient cells can not display appropriate immune responses following TLR signaling. Interestingly, CD40 signaling induces TRAF3 degradation (Brown et al. 2001) . Therefore, CD40 signaling negatively regulates signals induced by receptors that rely on TRAF3 for signaling such as TLRs. Furthermore, EBV infection results in expression of LMP1 protein which induces upregulation of the A20 gene, a negative regulator of NF-kB (Laherty et al. 1992 ). LMP1 induces a signaling cascade which mimics the CD40 signaling pathway in many aspects (Young and Rickinson 2004; Rastelli et al. 2008) . Altogether, degradation of TRAF3 and upregulation of A20 gene upon CD40L stimulation could weaken TLR promoting effects on EBV transformation. Surprisingly, while both TLR7/8 and TLR9 agonists enhanced the transformation efficiency of EBV, combination of these two agonists neither induced synergism nor additive effects on the transformation efficiency of EBV. Although paired TLR agonists were found to display a stronger vaccine adjuvant over a single TLR agonist, costimulation of B cells or other immune cells with a combination of TLR agonists may induce additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects depending on the signaling pathways induced by each agonist (Zheng et al. 2008 ). It has been demonstrated that combination of TLR7/8 and TLR9 agonists may counter-regulate each other through intracellular mechanisms in different immune cells, such as PBMCs, B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Gorden et al. 2006; Berghofer et al. 2007; Marshall et al. 2007; Booth et al. 2010 ). Using paired TLR agonists, it has recently been shown that activation of both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways results in a synergistic effect, while antagonistic or inert effect is delivered by paired TLR agonists that both act through the same signaling pathway (Bagchi et al. 2007 ), a finding similar to our results using TLR7, 8 and 9 agonists which are all acting through the MyD88 pathway.",

Thus, our previous data together with the present findings suggest that EBV might employ NF-jB activity in a biphasic manner, as a physiological advantage (Hiscott et al. 2001) . In early stage of EBV infection, when the virus is vulnerable and could easily be eradicated by the innate immune system, NF-jB activity is hampered, but subsequent to establishment of infection, EBV will take advantage of proliferative effect of the NF-jB pathway.",

The lower promoting effect of CD40L stimulation on efficiency of EBV transformation could be attributed to activation of different downstream signaling molecules following CD40-CD40L interaction with no beneficial effect to the replication cycle of EBV. Although CD40 ligation of B cells infected with EBV was shown to promote viral latency (Adler et al. 2002) , however, controversial results have been reported showing diminished growth of EBV-transformed LCLs following CD40 ligation (Pokrovskaja et al. 2002) . More investigations are required to get further insights into the biological role of CD40 ligation in the course of EBV infection and transformation.",

PBMCs infected with EBV were costimulated with TLR agonists and/or CD40L then seeded at 250, 500 and 1,000 cells/well over irradiated feeder cells. After 21 days of culture the number of wells that were positive or negative for the presence of growing LCLs was enumerated and the efficiency of transformation was determined based on the Poisson statistical analysis, taking into consideration the percent of B cells (CD19 ? cells) in PBMCs of all samples tested. Each line is constructed using the mean data points obtained from the three cell densities for all individuals tested",
