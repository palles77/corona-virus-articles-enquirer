A higher proportion of allergic rhinitis and asthmatic subjects were atopic compared with healthy controls, and asthmatic subjects had the lowest FEV 1 . There were no significant differences in age and gender among the groups. The proportion of respiratory virus detection was similar between asthmatic and healthy subjects (63.4% vs 71.4%). Among the detected viruses, rhinovirus was the most prevalent in the three subject groups. At baseline, sputum PAI-1 levels were significantly higher in asthmatic subjects than in non-asthmatic controls (median \u00b1 IQR; 3.6 \u00b1 2.6 vs 2.3 \u00b1 2.1 ng/ml, P < 0.02) ( Figure 1A ). In asthmatic patients, sputum PAI-1 levels increased signifcantly on Day 5-7 compared with the baseline levels (P < 0.05, Figure 1B ), whereas they did not change significantly in non-asthmatic subjects ( Figure E1 ). Sputum PAI-1 levels in asthmatic patients with exacerbation (FEV 1 drop \u226510%, n=4) were higher compared with those without exacerbation (n=17), although it was not statistically significant (6.6 vs 4.7 ng/ml in Day 1-3, p=0.9; 11.7 vs 4.8 ng/ml in Day 5-7, p=0.3). There was no significant difference in baseline NLF PAI-1 levels between asthmatics and non-asthmatics (0.05 vs 0.08 ng/ml, p=0.2). PAI-1 levels in NLF from asthmatics were significantly higher both at Day 1-3 and Day 5-7 compared with baseline (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively; Figure 1C ). Interestingly, asthmatic subjects had an early elevation of PAI-1 levels (Day 1-3) in NLF, which was not observed in NLF samples from non-asthmatics ( Figure E2 ). To investigate if rhinovirus, the most prevalent common cold virus, induces airway epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects to induce PAI-1, we obtained and cultured primary nasal epithelial cells from 7 asthmatics in submerged medium, and treated them with human rhinovirus (HRV) serotype 16 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, or vehicle control for 48 hours. PAI-1 levels in the supernatants of infected cultures from asthmatic patients increased significantly compared with non-infected cultures (P < 0.05, Figure 1D ).",

In addition, the common cold increased PAI-1 levels in upper and lower airways of asthmatics, but not in control subjects. Lastly, in vitro, HRV induced epithelial production of PAI-1. Our data on increased sputum PAI-1 levels at baseline in asthma are similar to previous reports. 6 Previous studies suggest that PAI-1 may be related to airway obstruction by not only extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in airway wall but also intraluminal fibrin deposition. 7, 8 This may explain at least in part the mechanism by which frequent exacerbations may cause progressive airway obstruction in a subset of patients, and why reduction in FEV 1 is associated with history of frequent exacerbations in asthmatic patients. 9 A similar study of asthmatics with cold showed that there was a very high level of fibrinogen in induced sputum on Day 4. 10 We hypothesize that this highly elevated fibrinogen in asthmatic airways can potentiate conversion to fibrin which is not degraded because of elevated local PAI-1, an occurrence that may lead to the airway obstruction. Although we could not find a negative correlation between sputum PAI-1 levels and lung function due to small sample size, we found that 2 patients with very high sputum PAI-1 level in Day 1-3 and Day 5-7 in Figure 1B were among 4 patients who had significant asthma exacerbation with FEV1 \u2265 10% drop. It would be interesting to conduct further studies on this observation. A recent study showed that sputum levels of PAI-1 were significantly higher in patients with a longer duration of asthma compared with those with shorter duration. 6 Our results raise the hypothesis that repeated respiratory viral infections may lead to repeated transient increases in airway PAI-1 levels in susceptible asthmatic patients, which over several years could lead to accelerated remodeling and progressive airway obstruction. 6, 8 In summary, this study demonstrates that lower airway PAI-1 levels are higher in asthmatics than in healthy subjects and a common cold further increases upper and lower airway PAI-1 in asthmatic subjects. These results may explain the association between recurrent exacerbations and persistent lower airway obstruction. Further studies are needed to understand whether elevated PAI-1 leads to accumulation of fibrin and ECM in airways of asthmatic patients. PAI-1 secretions during a common cold. Baseline sputum PAI-1 levels were measured in asthmatic and non-asthmatics subjects (A, red circles -allergic rhinitis; green triangles -healthy controls). Both sputum (B) and nasal lavage (C) PAI-1 levels were also measured during colds in asthmatic patients. D shows PAI-1 levels in supernatants of nasal epithelial cells from asthmatic patients, 48 hours after human rhinovirus (HRV) infection.",
