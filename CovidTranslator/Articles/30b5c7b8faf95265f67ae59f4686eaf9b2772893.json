The total fraction detected is lower for programs with only one layer of 227 screening, with arrival screening preferable to departure screening owing to the possibility of 228 symptom onset during travel. Considering higher proportions of subclinical cases, the overall 229 effectiveness of screening programs is further degraded, with a median of just one in ten 230 infected travellers detected by departure screening in the worst-case scenario. The key driver of 231 these poor outcomes is that, even in the best-case scenario, nearly two thirds of infected 232 travellers will not be detectable (as shown by the red regions in Fig. 3B ).

Using a mathematical model of screening with preliminary 262 estimates of nCoV epidemiology and natural history, we found that screening will in the best 263 case only detect less than half of infected travellers. We found that two main factors influenced 264 the effectiveness of screening. First, symptom screening depends on the natural history of an 265 infection: individuals are increasingly likely to show detectable symptoms with increasing time 266 since exposure. A fundamental challenge of screening is that many infected individuals will 267 travel during their incubation period, a point at which they still feel healthy enough to travel but 268 are simultaneously most difficult to detect. This effect is amplified when the incubation period is 269 longer; infected individuals have a longer window in which they may travel with low probability of 270 detection. Second, screening depends on whether exposure risk factors exist that would 271 facilitate specific and reasonably sensitive case detection by questionnaire. For nCoV, there is 272 so far limited evidence for specific risk factors; we therefore assumed that at most 40% of 273 travellers would be aware of a potential exposure, and that a minority would self-report their 274 exposure honestly, which led to limited effectiveness in questionnaire-based screening.

Quantitative estimates of screening 361 effectiveness will improve as more is learned about this recently-emerged virus, and will vary 362 with the precise design of screening programs. However, we present a robust qualitative finding: 363 in any situation where there is widespread epidemic transmission in source populations from 364 which travellers are drawn, travel screening programs can slow but not stop the importation of 365 infected cases. By decomposing the factors leading to success or failure of screening efforts, 366 our work supports decision-making about program design, and highlights key questions for 367 further research. We hope that these insights may help to mitigate the global impacts of nCoV 368 by guiding effective decision-making in both high-and low-resource countries, and may 369 contribute to prospective improvements in travel screening policy for future emerging infections. 370 371 .

First, we explored the probability that any particular infected individual would be detected 172 by a screening program, as a function of the time between exposure and the initiation of travel 173(Fig. 2). A crucial driver of the effectiveness of traveller screening programs is the duration of 174 the incubation period, particularly since infected people are most likely to travel before the onset 175 of symptoms. Here we considered three scenarios with different mean incubation periods: 5.5 176 days is most consistent with most existing estimates, while 4.5 and 6.5 days provide a 177 sensitivity analysis roughly consistent with ranges, confidence or credible intervals reported178 elsewhere (Backer et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020).

But so far the data have 399 primarily captured severe, hospitalized cases, so the true fraction of subclinical nCoV cases 400 remains a crucial unknown. Particularly given the conspicuous under-representation of children 401 and young adults among hospitalized patients (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020), our medium 402 and worst-case scenarios (75% and 50% subclinical) remain plausible. Numerous recent studies have estimated that the incubation period lasts about 5.5 days on 407 average (Backer et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020), with the tail of 408 the distribution stretching to at least 12 days (Backer et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Consistent 409 with these observations, a recent study by Backer, Klinkberg and Wallinga (2020) characterized 410 the incubation period distribution for nCoV, concluding that a Weibull distribution provided the 411 best fit to data, but that a gamma distribution performed almost as well.
