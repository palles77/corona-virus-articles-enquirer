Rapid diagnosis could contribute greatly in containing epidemics and thus avoid economic losses. However, the lack of robust isothermal visual method poses difficulty. In this study, a novel isothermal assay for detecting BPIV3 was established. The method includes a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) assay combined with reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). First, the analytical sensitivity and specificity of BPIV3 LFD RT-RPA were tested. The LFD RT-RPA assay has a detection limit of up to 100 copies per reaction in 30 min at 38\u00b0C. Then the performance of LFD RT-RPA was evaluated using 95 clinical samples. Compared to qPCR, the LFD RT-RPA assay showed a clinical sensitivity of 94.74%, a clinical specificity of 96.05% and 0.8734 kappa coefficient. These results have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the method to be developed into a point of care protocol for the diagnosis of BPIV3.",

BPIV3 is one of the most important viral respiratory agents of both young and adult cattle [1] . While most acute infections are subclinical, they can cause respiratory disease characterized by cough, fever and nasal discharge [2] . In some instances where animals are also subjected to high stress, resulting in severe bronchopneumonia from secondary bacterial infections [3] . A variety of factors, such as environmental temperature, transportation, hygiene, stocking density, co-mingling and host immune status, can contribute to increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection and severity of clinical disease [4] . BPIV3 has been associated with the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) [4, 5] , which is a major health problem of cattle worldwide. Thus, early detection of clinical infection is important as it can facilitate more rapid implementation of rigorous controls, which can result in reduced health care costs and improved cure rates.",

However, this method requires thermal cycling equipment and the settings of professional diagnostic laboratory. Moreover, most nucleic acid amplification technologies assays, including many isothermal amplification methods, require power-dependent instrumentation for incubation [8] . With a reaction time of 1-2 h, these can also be fairly time-consuming. Recently, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), a novel isothermal technique, has emerged as an ideal molecular technology for rapid and economical diagnostics [9] . With the development of nucleic acid purification technology independent of a laboratory, a lateral flow dipstick (LFD) combined with a RT-RPA assay is especially suitable for on-site diagnosis of clinical specimens.

We've especially noticed that when LF-probe is cut by nfo nuclease at the dSpacer position, the probe will be transformed into a primer for extension [9] . Therefore, the RPA product consists of two kinds: one amplified from the common F and R primers, and the other from the LF-probe and R. Two bands were thus observed in the electrophoresis (Fig. 1A) . Experiments have found that primer set F3/LF/R2 yielded highest amplification accuracy, producing products with an expected size of 311/210 base pairs (Fig. 1A) . This set also yielded a faster and darker LFD RT-RPA test line than others within 5 min (Fig. 1B) . Following reagent instruction (TwistDX), a temperature range of 30-48\u00b0C, and a time range of 5-30 min were tested. Results indicated that the reaction adapts to a wide temperature interval from 30 to 45\u00b0C, with the test band being the brightest in 38\u00b0C (Fig. 1C) . Therefore, 38\u00b0C was chosen as the approved reaction temperature for all latter LFD RT-RPA assays. As for time, distinct band could be seen in the test zone position for a range of 10-30 min (Fig. 1D) . Based on the results, time of incubation was controlled in 30 min in following LFD RT-RPA testing.",
