We have created a surface which is auto-protective to human innate immunity by combining three fundamentally different strategies, all developed by us previously, which have been shown to induce substantial, but incomplete hemocompatibility when used separately. In summary, we have conjugated a factor Hebinding peptide; and an ADP-degrading enzyme; using a PEG linker on both material and cellular surfaces. When exposed to human whole blood, factor H was specifically recruited to the modified surfaces and inhibited complement attack. In addition, activation of platelets and coagulation was efficiently attenuated, by degrading ADP. Thus, by inhibiting thromboinflammation using a multicomponent approach, we have created a hybrid surface with the potential to greatly reduce incompatibility reactions involving biomaterials and transplantation.",

            "text": "In modern medicine, artificial materials frequently come into contact with blood and other tissue fluids (e.g., in extracorporeal circulation devices used for hemodialysis, hemofiltration, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and plasmapheresis). This contact induces a sequence of events involving protein adsorption; inflammatory reactions, including activation of the complement and coagulation systems; and adhesion of immunocompetent cells to the exposed surfaces. These events result in serious thromboinflammatory incompatibility reactions targeting the implanted materials [1, 2] . For example, for hemodialysis patients, the risk of myocardial infarction is 5e10 times higher than for healthy individuals. Chronic whole-body inflammation triggered by hemodialysis likely contributes to arteriosclerosis in uremic patients and is associated with a significantly decreased life expectancy. Also, CPB and ECMO procedures, which have increased over the past decade as a result of vascular bypass surgery and long-lasting infections affecting the lungs (e.g., swine influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS), are associated with side effects related to contact between blood and material surfaces that result in cellular and humoral defense reactions known as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In addition, small implants within the bloodstream react with the cascade systems of the blood; instead of systemic reactions, these interactions produce other deleterious effects: Vascular stents elicit fibrosis, restenosis, and thrombosis at the implantation site, and cardiac aids and pumps can trigger thrombotic reactions, leading to emboli.",

Graft loss results in part from a thromboinflammatory instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR). This reaction consists of an innate immune attack triggered by activation of the complement and coagulation systems, followed by rapid binding of activated platelets and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) [3, 4] . The corresponding reactions in whole-organ transplantation are ischemia-reperfusion injury and xenogenic/allogeneic antibody-mediated rejection, the major mediator of cell damage during transplantation [6] , which is also triggered by complement activation and thrombotic reactions. Thus, it is important to make surfaces of artificial materials and transplanted cells inert against activation of innate immunity and the thrombotic cascade by regulating thromboinflammation.",

This surface modification with 5C6 and apyrase can be applied onto substrates (artificial materials) and cells. An amphiphilic polymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated phospholipid (PEG-lipid) coimmobilizes 5C6 and apyrase on the cell surface, as outlined in Fig. 1 . The PEG-lipid derivatives can be immobilized to cell membranes by hydrophobic interactions with the lipid bilayer membranes without either cytotoxicity or a volume increase [9, 10] . So far we have previously studied the effect of surface modification of living cells and islets with PEG-lipid derivatives on graft survival during cell transplantation [9] . The other end of the PEG derivative facing the fluid phase can be functionalized to allow binding of peptides, proteins, or oligonucleotides [10] . The PEG-lipid derivative itself is able to suppress coagulation and the inflammatory reactions of the IBMIR to a certain extent [11] . In this paper, we performed various assays to evaluate 5C6 and apyrase function: detection of complement-activation markers on the modified surfaces, hemolytic assays of the complement alternative pathway (AP), and xenogeneic biocompatibility assays of adherent porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) in contact with human whole blood.",

The modified surfaces were incubated with lepirudin-anticoagulated whole blood and complement activation (generation of C3a, C5a, sC5b-9) and granulocyte activation (expression of CD11b) was monitored. Coating with 5C6 significantly reduced all complement activation makers when compared to the control and lowered granulocyte activation via the AP (Supplemental Fig. 2aee) .

The PEG-lipid derivative on erythrocytes was detected using fluorescent streptavidin and biotin-PEG-lipid (Supplemental Fig. 3a) . The modified erythrocytes were then incubated with human serum and subjected to immunostaining for factor H, followed by FACS analysis (Fig. 2a,  Supplemental Fig. 3b ). Confocal microscopy revealed fluorescent staining on the erythrocyte surfaces modified with 5C6-PEG-lipid/ MeO-PEG-lipid but not on those treated with Sc-PEG-lipid/MeO-PEG-lipid; and FACS analysis yielded similar results. Next, we performed hemolytic assays to examine the effect of 5C6 on complement activation via the AP, by incubating rabbit erythrocytes with human serum [13, 14] . The optimal concentration of 5C6 to coat the erythrocyte surfaces was determined by mixing inert MeO-PEGlipid with 5C6-PEG-lipid at different proportions. Under uninhibited conditions, approximately 99% of the rabbit erythrocytes were hemolyzed after incubation with human serum. However, the lysis (calculated as y/(1-y), where y is the fraction lysed [18] ) was suppressed by surface modification with PEG-lipid and was further reduced in the presence of 5C6, as compared to Sc-modified groups (Fig. 2b, Supplemental Fig. 3c ). As the PEG-lipid concentration increased, the difference between 5C6-immobilized erythrocyte and Sc-immobilized erythrocyte became smaller as seen in Fig. 2b . The effect of PEG can be also seen clearly as the surface density of PEG is larger. Under optimal conditions, 5C6 was able to specifically recruit functional factor H from human serum and suppress AP-mediated complement activation on the erythrocyte surface.",

In addition to plasma membrane regulators (MCP, DAF, and CD59), the plasma proteins, C4-binding protein (C4BP) and factor H also regulate surface-bound CP and the AP convertases, respectively. Both these fluid-phase regulators are recruited to host cells by binding to cell-surface glyocosaminoglycans [19, 20] to regulate complement activation through the CP and AP, respectively. The concept of exploiting those complement-regulatory effects on foreign surfaces has been demonstrated by our group [21] : Engberg et al. have used streptococcal M protein-derived peptides to specifically recruit human C4BP to substrate surfaces, thereby reducing complement activation via the CP and suggesting RCA-binding peptides as promising 5 .

Several studies have indicated that complement activation on material surfaces is initiated through the CP [22, 23] .

Therefore, it seems of major importance to regulate the AP C3 convertase in order to avoid complement attack.",

Not only are platelets closely connected to the coagulation cascade, but they can also interact with leukocytes and trigger activation of complement, thereby acting as an important hub that mediates crosstalk between these components [30, 31] . When platelets are activated, a multi-step process begins that involves adhesion, aggregation, contraction, and secretion. Released ADP is essential for recruiting and aggregating platelets; therefore, it is an obvious target for platelet inhibition [32] . In order to regulate platelet activation, vascular ADP is continuously degraded under homeostatic conditions by CD39 (NTPDase-1, EC 3.6.1.5), an enzyme present on human endothelial cells [33] . In the present study, we used the homologous potato apyrase as a prototype enzyme to obtain proof-of-concept that this group of enzymes can be a valuable tool for attenuating thrombotic reactions on material and cell surfaces.",

In such conditions, extracellular adenosine is mainly derived from the enzymatic phosphohydrolysis of precursor nucleotides to adenosine [38, 39] . This two-step enzymatic process involves the ecto-apyrase CD39 (converting ATP/ ADP to AMP) and the ecto-5 nucleotidase CD73 (converting AMP to adenosine). Both enzymes have been implicated in attenuating acute injury and inflammation in models of ambient hypoxia [34] , cyclic mechanical stretch [40] , and bleomycin-induced lung injury [41] . Studies of NTPDase1-deficient mice have identified an important role for this enzyme in controlling acute immune responses [42] . NTPDase1-KO mice demonstrate exacerbated inflammation in experimental models of hypoxia, endotoxininduced lung inflammation, and colitis [34, 40] . Similarly, humans carrying a single specific point mutation in the NTPDase1 gene have recently been shown to be more susceptible to inflammatory bowel disease [40] . These studies suggest that the use of CD39 would also have an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effect in cell and whole-organ transplantation.",
