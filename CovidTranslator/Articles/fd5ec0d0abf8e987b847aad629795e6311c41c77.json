Furthermore, regulatory requirements are sometimes difficult to fulfil for a particular vaccine concept. Vaccines are produced on an industrial scale in government certified manufacturing facilities. The Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements, which have been incorporated into law, describe in detail the manufacturing standard. Since the introduction of veterinary medicinal product licensing in Europe some 25 years ago, the economic environment, the increasing legal and regulatory pressure and the changed agricultural scenery have lead to a marked consolidation among the veterinary vaccine manufacturers.",

This is particularly the case for those diseases where the traditional approaches have not been efficacious (Scarselli et al., 2005) . In simple terms, with all of the genes hypothetically identified for a bacterial pathogen it is possible to construct an array of sites on a solid sheet each containing bound synthetic DNA complementary to all of the genes in the genome. The messenger RNA (mRNA) extracted from the bacteria living in different environments is used to prepare probes in strengths proportionate to the amounts of each mRNA species present at the time of extraction. By detecting differences in the strength of probe hybridisation to the gene array it is possible to see which gene's levels of expression have changed relative to the different environments. Genes upregulated in vivo, or in cultures designed to mimic in vivo environments, that bioinformatic analyses indicate are likely to be surface expressed or secreted during critical stages of host colonisation or pathogenesis (and hence accessible to interference from host immunity) enable the identification of attractive candidate vaccine antigens without necessarily knowing their function. It is then possible to delete the gene(s) in question to confirm their role in pathogenesis in challenge models and also to produce recombinant purified antigens to use in vaccination trials. Provided the antigens are reasonably conserved amongst clinical isolates this strategy can provide a powerful route to efficacious vaccine development where crude preparations in the past have not achieved a desirable level of efficacy or safety. This technology now makes it possible to create live vaccines incapable of reversion to virulence, with minimal interference in the expression of important protective immunogens whilst inactivating powerful immune diverting immunogens that may interfere with the strength of efficacious responses.",

The likely approach to develop vaccines would be, first, the cloning and site directed mutagenesis to turn the HA-gene into a non-pathogenic form, and, second, the production of so-called high growth re-assortants producing considerable amounts of the new HA protein, which is, among others, the protective antigen in influenza virus. The latter can be achieved by reverse genetics and transfection techniques (Wood and Robertson, 2006) .

It contains soluble antigens secreted/ excreted from the parasite. Research has shown that during B. canis infection in dogs these antigens are released and cause disease.
