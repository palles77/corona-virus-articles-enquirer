Case fatality rates of filovirus disease outbreaks are among the highest reported for any human pathogen, exceeding 90% (ref. 1) . Licensed therapeutic or vaccine products are not available to treat filovirus diseases. Candidate therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Here we show that BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells. Biochemical, reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430 inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator. Post-exposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease in rodent models. Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection when administered as late as 48 hours after infection. In addition, BCX4430 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous viruses, including bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of non-human primate protection from filovirus disease by a synthetic drug-like small molecule. We provide additional pharmacological characterizations supporting the potential development of BCX4430 as a countermeasure against human filovirus diseases and other viral diseases representing major public health threats.",

            "text": "BCX4430, a novel nucleoside analogue (Fig. 1a) , was synthesized (Supplementary Information) as part of a small-molecule library designed as inhibitors of viral RNA polymerase activity. BCX4430 is designed to inhibit viral RNA polymerase activity indirectly through non-obligate RNA chain termination, a mechanism requiring anabolism of the parent compound to BCX4430-triphosphate (BCX4430-TP). Then, after pyrophosphate cleavage, incorporation of BCX4430-monophosphate (BCX4430-MP) into nascent viral RNA strands would be expected to cause premature termination of transcription and replication of viral RNA. In support of this proposed mechanism, BCX4430 is rapidly phosphorylated to BCX4430-TP in cultured cell lines and primary hepatocytes, similar to the natural adenosine nucleoside ( Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a ). Addition of BCX4430 reduces expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in an artificial EBOV minigenome replicon assay ( Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1b) , in which virion structural proteins comprising the viral ribonucleoprotein complex mediate transcription and replication of an RNA replicon template containing a GFP-reporter cassette. BCX4430-TP inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA polymerase transcriptional activity in a cell-free, isolated enzyme transcription assay ( Fig. 1d ) (an isolated filovirus RNA polymerase enzyme assay has yet to be reported) and induces premature termination of RNA chain synthesis by HCV RNA polymerase during template-directed primerextension assays ( Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1c) . In virus-infected cells, BCX4430 reduces surface-expressed MARV and EBOV glycoprotein and reduces the production of intracellular and extracellular MARV RNA ( Fig. 1f -h and Extended Data Fig. 1d ). Additionally, HeLa cells incubated with $25 mM BCX4430 produce no detectable infectious MARV virus (concentration providing 90% inhibition (IC 90 ) 5 5.4 mM) (Fig. 1h) .",

Antiviral effects were specific and did not result from cellular toxicity or anti-proliferative effects, as assessed by enumeration of live cells during all HCI assays and by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. In HeLa cells, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) of BCX4430 exceeded 500 mM as determined by the LDH assay, and consistently exceeded 100 mM using the HCI-based assay (Table 1 ). An antiviral effect was confirmed in infected human macrophages cultured from normal peripheral blood monocytes, using EBOV (Extended Data Fig. 1e ). It is important to note that immortalized cell lines exhibit a substantially attenuated capacity to convert BCX4430 to its active TP form, compared with primary hepatocytes (Extended Data Fig. 1a) . Thus, the results obtained from antiviral assessments relying on immortalized cells may underrepresent the antiviral potency of BCX4430 achievable in vivo during experimental or clinical infections.",

In both the i.p. and aerosolized-virus challenge models, BCX4430 conferred significant post-exposure protection when treatment was initiated within 48 h of virus exposure (Extended Data Fig. 4a ).

Cynomolgus macaques were experimentally infected with a lethal dose of wild-type MARV (Musoke variant), derived from a human clinical isolate 22 , and animals were administered with 15 mg kg 21 BCX4430 twice daily by i.m. injection beginning 1-48 h after infection and continuing for 14 days. The six infection-control subjects succumbed by day 12 (Fig. 3a) , after having developed viraemia (Fig. 3b) and characteristic signs of filovirus disease, including behavioural inactivity, maculopapular rash, increases in liver injury markers such as aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin (Fig. 3c, d) , and prolongations of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (Fig. 3e, f) . All animals treated with BCX4430 beginning 24 or 48 h after infection survived. Five out of six (83%) animals treated with BCX4430 beginning 1 h after infection survived (Fig. 3a) . Consistent with the proposed antiviral mechanism of action, BCX4430 significantly and substantially reduced serum MARV burden (Fig. 3b) , without inducing type I interferon responses (Extended Data Fig. 4d ), as has been observed for c 3 -Npc A in mice 15 . Additionally, BCX4430 ameliorated haemorrhagic disease manifestations, as evidenced by shorter PT and aPTT times and reduced laboratory indices of liver damage, such as serum AST and bilirubin concentrations, compared with vehicle treatment (Fig. 3c-f) .",

Furthermore, we have provided evidence that BCX4430 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other highly virulent RNA viruses (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 2 ).

For other viruses, inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was assessed in cell-based assays using neutral-red uptake, as described previously 24 . Replication of EBOV minigenome RNA constructs was assayed by using a plasmid-based reconstituted replication/transcription system 25 . Inhibition of RNA transcriptional activity was assessed in an isolated HCV polymerase assay 26 and inhibition of HCV polymerase RNA synthesis activity was evaluated using a template-driven 32 P-GG primer extension assay. Mouse models of EBOV, MARV and RAVV disease have been described previously 27, 28 . Experiments were conducted using mouse-adapted strains of EBOV (Mayinga variant) and RAVV (Ravn variant). A guinea pig MARV-Musoke parenteral challenge model and virus aerosolization methods used for guinea pig exposures have been previously described 19, 29 . BCX4430 was administered in a vehicle of sterile 0.9% saline for injection for all in vivo applications. Animal infection experiments were performed in biosafety level 4 containment facilities at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). All experimental treatment replication was conducted using biological replication, except for the virus-yield reduction assay (Fig. 1h) , which relied on technical replication. Research was conducted under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocol in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, PHS Policy and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals. The facility where this research was conducted is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International and adheres to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 2011.",

Performance of positive biocontrol reagents testosterone and 7-hydroxycoumarin was assessed in parallel and met assay acceptability specifications. { Half-life was calculated as t1/2 5 0.693/k, where k is the elimination rate constant in the equation describing first-order decay (Ct 5 C0 3 e 2kt ), and Ct and C0 are the peak area ratios at time t and time 0, respectively. Data points were fitted to a first-order decay model by nonlinear regression, using GraphPad Prism (version 5.04 or higher) without weighting or any user intervention. { Intrinsic clearance (CLint) was calculated based on CLint 5 k/P, where k is the elimination rate constant and P is the protein concentration in the incubation. 1 Expected metabolite(s) detected.",
