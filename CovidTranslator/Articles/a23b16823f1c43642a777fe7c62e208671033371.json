If chlamydia1 pneumonia is suspected clinically, a swab of the nasopharynx should be obtained for chlamydia direct fluorescent antibody and chlamydia culture. Direct fluorescent antibody results are usually available in 1 day, and culture within 3 to 4 days. If conjunctivitis is present a swab of the conjunctiva should be obtained and sent for direct fluorescent antibody and culture. Swabs for chlamydia culture must be placed in transport media and delivered promptly to the laboratory because chlamydia are fastidious and killed easily.",

A few situations in particular would warrant such an evaluation. The first is an infant with a clinical course compatible with C. trachomatis pneumonia, namely an infant 3 to 16 weeks of age, afebrile with a staccato cough, with or without conjunctivitis. Diagnosis of Chlamydia in these infants necessitates investigation and treatment of the mother and her sex partners according to Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.8 Normal infants who have a rather severe degree of illness or infants who have an underlying condition such as an immunodeficiency warrant a thorough search for an etiologic agent. Investigation of infants may be warranted during a community outbreak such as an influenza epidemic.

The spectrum of erythromycin includes Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus, Ureaplasma, and B. pertussis. If otitis media also is present, the combination drug erythromycin/ sulfasoxazole will provide additional action against the otitis media pathogens H. infuenzae and M . cattarhalis. The newer macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin have an in-vitro spectrum that spans all the above. These agents are available in suspension form and are approved for the treatment of otitis media.
