On 11 th March 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this disease as pandemic [1] . Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention showed an increased mortality in people with diabetes (2.3% vs. 7.3%; overall vs. in patients with diabetes respectively) from a report of 72,314 cases of COVID-19 [2] . People with diabetes and COVID-19 may need special attention and clinical care [3] . In the absence of any known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a \"public-health emergency\", many drugs have been tried recently in the treatment for COVID-19 that includes a low-cost antimalarial drug chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), along with several other antiviral drugs. Because HCQ has been approved in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in India since 2014 as a third-or fourth-line drug, it would be interesting to research its impact in patients with diabetes, infected with COVID-19.",

In addition, chloroquine also inhibits the quinone reductase-2, which is involved in sialic acid biosynthesis (an acidic monosaccharides of cell transmembrane proteins required for ligand recognition) that makes this agent a broad antiviral agent. It is important to note that both human coronavirus HCoV-O43 and orthomyxoviruses uses sialic acid moieties as a receptor. Moreover, chloroquine changes the pH of lysosomes and likely inhibits cathepsins, that leads to the formation of the autophagosome which cleaves SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.",

Previous experimental studies have also demonstrated that chloroquine has potent anti-SARS-CoV-1 effects in vitro, primarily attributable to a deficit in the glycosylation receptors at the virus cell surface, so that it cannot bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in lung, heart, kidney and intestine. Since SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the similar surface receptor ACE2, it is believed that chloroquine can also interfere with ACE2 receptor glycosylation thus prevents SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the target cells [6] [7] [8] [9] . Chinese researchers who studied the effect of chloroquine in vitro (using Vero E6 cell line infected by SARS-CoV-2) found chloroquine to be highly effective in reducing viral replication that can be easily achievable with standard dosing due to its favorable penetration in tissues including the lung [6, 10] .",

It is believed that both the agents could be effective tools against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [10, 11] . However, an important question that still remains is whether HCQ has a similar effect on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some data show HCQ effectively inhibited both the entry, transport and the post-entry stages of SARS-CoV-2, similar to the chloroquine and one study found HCQ to be a more potent agent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [12, 13] . In addition, HCQ acts effectively on other intracellular bacterial infections such as Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and Tropheryma whipplei (Whipple's disease) [14, 15] . Addition of hydroxyl molecule makes HCQ less permeable to blood-retinal barrier and allows faster clearance from retinal pigment cell, thereby suggesting a lesser risk of retinal toxicity with HCQ, as compared to chloroquine [16] . Furthermore, the narrow therapeutic and safety index margin with chloroquine makes HCQ a safer option than chloroquine.",

However, no benefit of chloroquine was seen in the prevention of influenza and dengue infection in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial [29, 30] . Similarly, chloroquine was active in ex vivo studies but not in the in vivo studies against ebolavirus, nipah and influenza viruses [31] [32] [33] . Data of chloroquine against chikungunya virus is even more intriguing. While chloroquine had satisfactory antiviral activity against chikungunya in vitro, animal studies showed increase in virus replication, aggravation of fever and incomplete viral clearance [34] . Human trials of chloroquine showed no improvement in chikungunya acute illness and rather an increase in chronic arthralgia was observed during post-illness period, compared to the controls [35] . The role of chloroquine against Human Immunodeficiency Virus was inconclusive [36] . The only viral disease where chloroquine was modestly effective so far before COVID-19 era was chronic hepatitis C suggesting an increased virological response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin [37] . Therefore, the results of chloroquine and HCQ so far done against COVID-19, more promising than previous trial in other viral diseases. Moreover, these drugs are of low cost, reasonably safe (see below), and widely available in countries where malaria is endemic.",

Since both these drugs have the potential to prolong QTc, routine electrocardiography is essential prior to starting these drugs. Co-administration of other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval (such as anti-arrhythmic, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-histaminic, teneligliptin, ondansetron and moxifloxacin etc.) must be avoided [38, 39] . Moreover, addition of azithromycin to HCQ as done in French trial by Gautret et al may increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Perform ECG daily if QTc is 450-500 msec. Additionally, hypoglycemia must be looked for in patients with diabetes especially with concurrent use of chloroquine/HCQ and lopinavir/ritonavir. Chloroquine and HCQ should not be used concurrently with lopinavir/ritonavir and remdisivir for anticipated QTc prolongation. Finally, pharmacovigilance on visual and mental disturbance is also closely required.",

            "text": "Although the detailed results of this trial are not yet published and only available in a letter form, interestingly, this early result led China to include chloroquine in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China recommended inclusion of chloroquine in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention,Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19. In this study, chloroquine was given in dose of 500 mg of chloroquine twice daily in mild to severe COVID-19 pneumonia (seetable 1).The second human study which is currently available was conducted with HCQ. In an open-label, nonrandomized trial (n=36) conducted in Marseille, France, Gautret et al found that HCQ alone and combination of HCQ plus azithromycin was highly and significantly effective in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage (measured by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) in only three-to six days in COVID-19 subjects, compared to control. The virological clearance day-6 post-inclusion (primary outcome) with HCQ vs. control was 70.0% versus 12.5%, respectively (p=0.001). In addition, the virological clearance at day-6 post-inclusion in HCQ plus azithromycin, HCQ and control arm was 100%, 57.1% and 12.5% respectively (p<0.001). This data suggests a synergistic effect of azithromycin with HCQ. Indeed, azithromycin has shown an antiviral effect against Zika and Ebola viruses in in vitro studies; however, it is not yet known whether it has any action against COVID-19 as well[19]. These results of converting a potential carrier to a seronegative patient are of importance with regards to preventing community transmission of COVID-19. Since the data from Wuhan, China showed that some patients were carrier as long as up to 37 days (usually around 20 days), results of this study are very encouraging in the context of converting a patient to a seronegative subject within 6 days. Interestingly, this study also showed that the effect of HCQ was significantly higher (p<0.05) in symptomatic patients as compared to asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. The authors have acknowledged limitations of the study; a small sample size, dropout of six patients and limited follow-up, apart from the nonrandomized and open-label nature of the trial. A close look in to this study also suggests that the Cycle threshold (Ct) value for nasopharyngeal swab PCR to call it as a sample negative, was lower (Ct value >35 was deemed as negative for virus) compared to conventional Ct threshold of >40. Ct is defined as the number of cycles to be run for the PCR test to turn positive. In other words, lower the number of Ct denotes more virus is present and lesser number of cycles are required to hit the threshold. Moreover, nasopharyngeal swab PCR is a less sensitive tool, compared to PCR of Broncho-alveolar lavage and sputum in COVID-19. Furthermore, exclusion of five patients (26%) receiving HCQ from the overall analysis, dilutes the final results.Nevertheless, based on limited available evidences to date, and given the prevailing pandemic of COVID-19, some of the institutions and or organizations have already recognized the utility of chloroquine and HCQ[20]. The expert consensus from the Department of Science and Technology and Health Commission of Guangdong province published on 20th February (based on in vitro evidence and still unpublished clinical experience) chloroquine phosphate tablet at a dose of 500 mg twice per day for 10 days for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the absence of contraindication to the drug[21]. A Central Clinical Task Force from Korea who have treated 27 cases of COVID-19 recommend using lopinavir 400mg/Ritonavir 100mg BID or Chloroquine 500mg orally per day or Hydroxychloroquine 400mg orally per day for 7-10 days, in moderate to severe case of COVID-19[22]. Similarly, The Dutch Center of Disease control in a public document on its website, also suggested the use of chloroquine in those having severe COVID-19 infection admitted in the intensive care unit[23].",
