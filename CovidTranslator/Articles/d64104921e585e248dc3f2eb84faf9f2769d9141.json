[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Particularly, quercetin is a well-known protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor at micromolar level. For instance, its IC 50 value is 0.9 mM against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and 15 mM against Src tyrosine kinase respectively, [6, 7] indicating that this natural product is more active against EGFR than Src tyrosine kinase. During the last decade there has been considerable interest in synthesis, [8] [9] [10] functional elucidation, [11, 12] and biological evaluation of quercetin and its derivatives [13] [14] [15] . Most of the studies were focused on the quercetin O-glycosides, the majority of which have a sugar linkage at the 3-OH. Up to now, the quercetin-3-O-amino acid-ester was neither discovered as a natural product, nor reported on synthesis and bioactivity studies. Therefore, whether this type of compounds could be synthesized and whether they are still active against PTKs remain unknown.",

Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase which functions as an early upstream signal transduction protein, is activated in several human cancers, including carcinomas of the breast, lung, colon, esophagus, skin, parotid, cervix, as well as gastric tissues [19, 20] .

Indeed compound 1 still exhibits two free hydroxyl groups. However the higher reactivity of position 3 allows the selective esterification by protected amino acids in THF using 1.2 equiv. of DCC (N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) as condensing agent and a little DMAP (4-dimethylaminopyridine) as catalyst. Cleavage of benzyl group was performed with hydrogenolysis catalyzed by 10% Pd/C. Then, the desired final products quercetin-3-O-amino acid-esters (3a-o) were obtained in good yields after purification by chromatography. Substitution at N atom of amino acid moiety is important. In our first approach to get the compounds bearing deprotected amino group of amino acid moiety, trifluoroacetate acid solution of dichloromethane was used to remove the tertbutyloxycarbonyl group (Scheme 2). However, no desired product was detected in the crude product. We conjecture that the target compound was decomposed in the acidic medium. So an alternative approach performed under mild condition was then investigated (Scheme 2). Unfortunately, attempts to debenzylate the compounds bearing benzylated N atom in amino acid moiety under H 2 atmosphere at ambient temperature was not successful. Based on above study, we deduced that the compounds without protective groups of N atom are unstable. Besides, we tried to synthesize the compounds bearing Boc-Ser, Ac-Gly and Ac-Thr.",

Thus, the introduction of the amino acid group into quercetin leads to the reverse of the high inhibitory selectivity from EGFR to Src.

Therefore, the docking approach and parameters are reasonably reliable. The predicted binding free energies (DG) of the 8 new compounds are listed in Table 2 . Noticeably, the predicted DG values of the new compounds to Src kinase (\u00c08.1 kcal/mol in average) is stronger by 1.4 kcal/mol than that to EGFR (\u00c06.7 kcal/ mol in average), which is in agreement with our experimental observation that the 8 new compounds are stronger inhibitors against Src kinase than against EGFR kinase. Therefore, the selectivity of the newly synthesized quercetin-3-O-amino acid-esters should be attributed to the specific property of the substituted R groups, the amino acids (Table 1) . Different conformations have been found for these compounds in the active pockets of both proteins. For the comparison of the difference in binding mechanism, the pairs of hydrophobic interaction (HI hereinafter) and the number of hydrogen bonds (HB hereinafter) between the new compounds and the two targets are analyzed by the program LIGPLOT [23] . The result reveals that there are, in average, 14 HIs and 3.5 HBs between Src and each of the new compounds, while there are, in average, only 9 HIs and 2.5 HBs between EGFR and each compound (Table S1, Figs. S1-S5, Supplementary material). In other words, one third more of these two kinds of interactions were observed between the compounds and Src kinase than EGFR kinase. As examples, the interaction details of the two most active compounds (3i and 3j) are shown in Fig. 1 . There are 12 atoms of 3i forming hydrophobic interactions with 7 residues of Src, of which 5 atoms are from the newly substituted group of 3i (Fig. 1B) ; while there are only 5 atoms of 3i forming hydrophobic interaction with 2 residues of EGFR, of which only 2 atoms are from the substituted group (Fig. 1A) . Two hydrogen bonds form between 3i and Src, while 4 HBs between the compound and EGFR. Regarding the binding of 3j, the hydrophobic interaction between 3j and Src is similar to that between 3j and EGFR, but there are 4 HBs between 3j and Src while only 1 between 3j and EGFR. Therefore, both hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions are important to the high selectivity of the novel quercetin-3-O-amino acid-esters against Src kinase.",
