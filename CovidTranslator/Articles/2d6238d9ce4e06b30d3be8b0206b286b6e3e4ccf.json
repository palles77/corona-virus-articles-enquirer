Chicks were humanely euthanized at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21 and 28 days post infection (dpi) for necropsy examination, and tissues were collected for histopathology and virus detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Respiratory clinical signs and gross lesions consisting of tracheal caseous exudate and plugs, and swollen kidneys (with or without) urate deposits were observed in SPF and broiler chicks. The onset of disease developed more slowly and were of lesser severity in broiler compared to SPF chicks, reflecting the inhibitory effects of the IBV maternalantibodies in the broiler chicks or genetic/strain susceptibility, or both. Head swelling was observed in one infected broiler chick at 15 dpi and the virus was recovered by RT-PCR and isolation. In the IS/885-infected SPF chicks, cystic oviducts were found in two female chicks. IS/885 was isolated from the cystic fluid. Using ELISA, low to moderate levels of the antibodies to IBV was detected in the SPF compared to broiler infected chicks.",

A large number of serotypes and genotypes of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains have been reported worldwide (de Wit et al., 2011a; Jackwood, 2012 ). This appears to be due to constant changes in the spike-protein of IBV strains resulting in the emergence of new IBV variants (Cavanagh, 2007) . In the winter of 2000, a severe outbreak of renal disease occurred in several broiler farms in Israel. An IBV strain, designated IS/885/00, was isolated from the kidneys of these flocks (Meir et al., 2004) .",

In addition, an increasing number of strains closely related to IS/885/00 have been reported in Israel (Meir et al., 2004) , Egypt (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2012) , Iraq (Mahmood et al., 2011) , Libya (Awad et al., 2014a) and other Middle East countries (Ganapathy et al., 2015) . To date, through our diagnostic services, we have detected this strain in samples received from France, Ukraine and Pakistan.

Of the 45 birds, three died; one at 12 dpi and two at 19 dpi (6.7%). Apart from respiratory signs, one bird showed swelling of the head, with a foamy ocular and nasal discharge at 14 dpi. The swelling increased by 15 dpi and the periocular tissues were also affected (Fig 1) . For welfare reasons, this bird was euthanized for necropsy and sampling was carried out. A sterile dissection was performed to assess any gross lesions underneath the skin. Subcutaneous swabs were taken for virus detection by RT-PCR, VI and for bacterial culture. Virus detection was performed in our laboratory while the bacterial culture, isolation and identification was carried out by a bacteriology diagnostic laboratory (School of Veterinary Science, University of Liverpool).

            "text": "The results presented in this study demonstrate that IS/885/00 is a virulent IBV, as extensive disease was produced following infection in both types of chicks. In addition to the respiratory signs, gross lesions comprising of tracheal caseous exudate and plugs, and swollen kidneys (with or without) urate deposits were observed. Such clinical signs have been observed following infection with virulent IBV M41 (Butcher et al., 1990) , Moroccan G strain (Ambali and Jones, 1990) , 793B (Boroomand et al., 2012) , It-02 (Dolz et al., 2012) and QX (Ganapathy et al., 2012) . These clinical signs and lesions were more severe in SPF than in the broiler chicks, indicating differences in the susceptibility to IBV infection in these different types of birds. This could be due to the genetic line of the birds or the IBV MDAs in the broiler chicks which probably neutralized certain amounts of IBVs (Ignjatovic et al., 2003) . Previous studies using virulent IBV M41 demonstrated a considerable difference between two white leghorn chick lines in terms of the severity and duration of respiratory signs (Otsuki et al., 1990) .",

Absence of a letter indicates that there were no significant differences (p N 0.05) between the IBV antigens at any of the time points. The cut-off point = N3log 2 . \u204e Values differed significantly from each representative control group. IBVs at a young age has been reported for IBV M41 (Crinion et al., 1971; Crinion and Hofstad, 1972; Jones and Jordan, 1972) and, recently, QX (Benyeda et al., 2009; de Wit et al., 2011b; Ganapathy et al., 2012) . We report, for the first time, similar pathological development in SPF chicks that received the IS/885 virus at 1-day old. In addition, virus with 86% part-S1 sequence identity to the original inoculum was isolated from the cystic fluid. The detection of IBV IS/885 in the oviduct fluid demonstrates both active replication of the virus in the epithelium and its abundance in the fluid and these were shed by epithelial cells. The epithelial cells of the oviduct are the primary cells infected by IBV (Crinion and Hofstad, 1972) . The IS/885 infection has caused a diffuse loss in the cilia, epithelial necrosis and infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells into the oviduct which suggests that the virus has replicated in the epithelial lining of the oviduct. The pathogenicity of IBV strains for the oviduct varies as some do not replicate in the oviduct neither causing lesions nor showing significant amounts of viral antigen in the epithelial cells (Crinion and Hofstad, 1972) . IBV Conn and Iowa failed to produce any gross or histopathological change in the oviduct, in contrast, IBV M41 produces the greatest number of changes, followed by Australian T (Crinion and Hofstad, 1972) . Benyeda et al. (2009) did not detect any abnormalities in the oviducts of 793B infected one-day-old SPF chicks, whereas a variable percentage of oviduct dilatations were detected following inoculation with five different QX-like strains. It appears that along with M41 and QX, IS/885 should be considered as a potential cause of cystic oviducts in female chickens.",

In both types of birds, severe and early onset of histopathological lesions was seen in the trachea, compared to relatively mild lesions in the kidney.

            "text": "The immune response after infection with IBV was measured by ELISA and HI. With ELISA, a maximum mean antibody titer was found at 21 days post infection in SPF and broilers. For HI, sera were assayed against M41 and 793B since most producers use live and inactivated vaccines related to these serotypes. IS/885 antigen was also used as a homologous comparison. With HI, distinctive patterns were seen in broiler chicks; higher mean HI titres against M41 and 793B at day-old reflects the maternal antibodies derived from parent birds that were previously vaccinated using Massachusetts, 793B or D274 vaccines. For 3, 6 and 9 days post infection, though there were no significant differences between the IS/885-infected broiler chicks, the titres declined against all three HI antigens. From 15 days post infection, the mean HI titres against M41, 793B and IS/885 peaked by 21 days post infection and then declined by 28 days post infection. In contrast to day-old sera, the mean titer is highest for the IS/885 antigen, reflecting a better reactivity with the homologous antigen. These significant levels of HI antibodies against the IS/885 antigen were observed when compared to the level of antibody response against M41 and 793B antigens in IS/ 885-infected birds. This finding supports the use of the homologous virus as an antigen in the HI test, as it has been reported that the HI test is strain specific (Monreal et al., 1985; de Wit et al., 1997) .",
