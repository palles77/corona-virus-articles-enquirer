These countermeasures need to be looked at in terms of security design. \"Security design involves the systematic integration of design, technology, and operation for the protection of three critical assets -people, information, and property\u2026. The process of designing security into architecture is known as crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED).\" 17 As mentioned previously, the key to selecting appropriate countermeasures for a particular facility is for a risk assessment to be conducted. Because fire is a risk in high-rise buildings, the following is noted regarding their fire protection features: office buildings that have properly designed, installed, operated, tested, and maintained automatic fire detection and suppression systems and other fire protection features -automatic closing fire doors for compartmentation and maintenance of the integrity of occupant escape routes and automatic smoke control systems to restrict the spread of smoke -do have the necessary early warning systems to quickly detect fires and warn occupants (including tenants and visitors) of their presence, as well as the necessary automated sprinkler systems to quickly extinguish a fire in its early stages. One of the key issues here is the presence or absence of sprinklers.",

Measures for controlling access to these areas vary from site to site, depending on building management's policy, but generally incorporate some or all of those described in the following sections. Vehicle Access to Parking Lots or Garages. Access to parking lots or garages may be manual or automatic using a variety of methods that include the following: 1. Entry at will. There are no controls on the entry of vehicles (apart from possible vehicle height, weight, and width restrictions at the point of entry). 2. A vehicle detector embedded in the roadway, which automatically opens an entry gate or raises a gate arm. 3. A parking attendant, a valet, or a security person stationed at the point of entry or at a remote location linked to the point of entry by an intercom or a closed-circuit television (CCTV) system and a key switch or a remote control device that opens an entry gate, raises a gate arm, or lowers a surfacemounted traffic barrier. 4. A ticket (imprinted with the date and time of entry) dispensed by a machine at the point of entry that when withdrawn from the control unit automatically opens an entry gate or raises a gate arm. 5. An electronic access card, an alphanumeric key pad, or a vehicle identification system such as a transponder that opens an entry gate, raises a gate arm, or lowers a surface-mounted traffic barrier. When exiting a controlled-access parking lot or structure, the driver usually is required to submit to a similar procedure to that encountered on entry, make a monetary payment (sometimes using a pay-on-exit machine), or use a token. Many access control systems with entry and exit card readers incorporate an antipassback feature. This prevents an access card from being used again to authorize entry of a second vehicle before the card has been used to authorize exit of the first vehicle. Vehicle Access to Loading Dock/Shipping and Receiving Areas. Vehicles entering loading dock/shipping and receiving areas may do so at will and park at whatever loading bays or docks are available, or they may be permitted to enter and be directed to park in certain areas by a loading dock attendant who will then supervise subsequent loading or unloading. (Some buildings keep loading dock doors and gates closed between delivery and pick up of items. Also, docks that are normally unattended may have an intercom or buzzer system, possibly in conjunction with CCTV, to allow drivers to remotely summon building staff for assistance.) Some higher security buildings require vehicles, particularly vans and trucks, and especially those that will proceed to underbuilding loading dock/shipping and receiving areas, to undergo an on-street visual inspection before being allowed to enter. (As a result of the events of September 11, 2001 , some landmark high-risk office buildings deployed a mobile X-ray vehicle to screen such vehicles, including trucks, for explosives, prior to entry.)",

            "text": "After normal business hours, access control to most office buildings and interior areas is usually strict. An obvious way to provide off-hours access to an office building would be to furnish keys to all building occupants or to those who need to enter the facility after hours. This approach, however, can have disastrous consequences proportional to the size of the building and the number of occupants. A heavy workload and costly expense can be created by lost keys, keys not returned by departing tenant employees, and the necessity of rekeying building entrances and reissuing keys to building key holders every time a key has gone astray. In addition, there may be the problem of the unauthorized duplication of keys. To avoid all these consequences, most office buildings never issue building access keys to tenants but rely on some way of verifying a person's right to enter the building. This verification may involve the following procedures. Visual Recognition. Building security staff or a receptionist may verify on sight a person's right to enter. Several problems may result, however, from this form of verification. For example, someone who closely resembles a person authorized to enter may be admitted in error. Also, particularly if the building is large with a high population, it will be difficult for security staff or the receptionist to recognize all persons authorized to enter. If there is a change or substitution of the security staff or receptionist, the new person will not be familiar with the persons authorized to enter. This may result in the questioning of authorized persons who normally are never challenged and subsequent complaints to building management. Finally, if the security staff is distracted by another duty, an unauthorized person may gain entry without being observed. Authorization Documents. A document (a letter, a memorandum, or an e-mail) listing those authorized for after-hours access may be provided in advance to security staff at the building entrance. Persons requesting access will identify themselves to building security staff. Security will compare their name (which should be confirmed by a driver's license or other photo identification) with the names listed in the document. In many buildings, tenants will provide management with a written request on their own stationery listing the names of the persons involved and the time after-hours access is permitted. Building security staff or the receptionist often will set up a file sorted alphabetically by tenant name, or by the last name of the person to be granted access, to minimize time spent searching for the appropriate authorization.",

Building management of a major office building gave building security staff a memorandum to allow access of a pest control company to a specific tenant suite on a particular Friday night. The pest control company failed to appear on the night authorized but did arrive the following Monday evening. Building security staff did not thoroughly check the paperwork and permitted the pest control company to enter and carry out their work. The next business day, several of the tenant employees became ill from the lingering effects of the pest treatment. The reason for authorizing entry on Friday evening was to allow two days for any residual pesticide to dissipate. Permitting the work to occur on a Monday evening negated this precautionary safety measure. Building Identification Cards, Passes, and Badges. A building identification card, a pass, or a badge is sometimes used to verify the bearer's identity and privilege to enter after hours. The identification means should be numbered sequentially, stating the person's name and the company's name, and should contain the person's signature, a color photograph, and in some instances an expiration date. It should be laminated for durability, and be tamper resistant (although this will not necessarily eliminate the potential for the plastic envelope being cut and the card, pass, or badge being modified and then re-laminated).

All relevant information about the visitor (such as name, company, person they will be visiting, time of visit, and any special instructions for handling the visitor) can be stored in a database and used to print out a visitor badge when the visitor is cleared for entry (the value of visitor badges decreases if the visitor is allowed access to areas where occupants are not required to wear identification badges.

After-Hours Access Register or Log. Whichever access control procedures are used, many office buildings maintain an after-hours access register or log to record afterhours access activity. This log includes details such as the person's name (printed for legibility) and signature, the name of the company the person represents or the tenant he or she is visiting, the date, and time in and out. In case of an after-hours building emergency, the log can be used to help ascertain who is in the building. However, the register or log does not provide a record of all persons in the building after hours, because some persons will have accessed the building during normal business hours before the access control log was in use. To determine exactly which tenants are in the building after hours, it would be necessary to telephone or to personally visit every tenant. Such a procedure, particularly in large office buildings, is not considered practical. Right to Pass Signs or Plates. Signs or sidewalk plates, generally located outside the building, may state the following:",

Then the receptionist may telephone the employee who is expecting the visitor and ask the person to come to the reception area to escort the guest. Also, some large firms and government agencies provide a corporate mailroom with a separate entrance where all couriers or others who are dropping off or picking up merchandise from the tenant space can be directed. This eliminates the need to escort these individuals separately. Unwanted Solicitors. Receptionists can play an important role in building security by reporting solicitors they encounter. Solicitors may come to buildings with items for sale secreted in a bag or a briefcase. If they can obtain entry through the building lobby, once on a floor they will open up the container, take out their product, and proceed from floor to floor, tenant to tenant, selling their merchandise. Even though solicitors may be legitimate, their presence can be disruptive to tenant business; furthermore, criminals can pose as solicitors.

Using a prearranged signal or code phrase -such as \"Sarah, could you watch the telephones for me? I'm going to be busy with the flower seller for a few minutes\" -may successfully delay the individual until security staff arrives. One way to detain a solicitor is to feign interest in the product and call other \"interested\" employees to look at the merchandise, preoccupying the solicitor. Other ways for the receptionist to detain suspicious persons would be to carry on a friendly conversation, offer an employment application, or use some other deception.

Tenant Security Systems. Some tenants have installed their own access control systems -electric locks, mechanical or electrical push-button combination locks, card-operated locks, biometric system-operated locks, or a combination of technologies -that control the operation of entry door(s) to tenant areas. Sometimes, CCTV systems, intercoms, and intrusion detection systems are used in conjunction with these devices. When considering a system, the local fire authority that has jurisdiction should be consulted to determine whether such an installation is permitted by local codes and standards; this is particularly important when the access control devices are to be installed on doors leading directly from elevator lobbies to the tenant space.

One possible solution is to furnish tenant entrance keys to all employees who require access. This approach, however, can lead to the same problems discussed earlier in the section Pedestrian Access to Buildings. Instead, some tenants issue keys only to a few select individuals. This alleviates some key control problems but creates the need for one of these persons to be present when special after-hours access is required. In some instances, building management has permitted some tenants to leave keys with security staff for special after-hours access. The tenant's employees must then return the keys to their representative on the next business day. Alternatively, if someone is present inside the tenant space, he or she may be telephoned by building security and notified of the request for entry or, according to a predetermined policy, the tenant may designate an on-call manager who handles such afterhours matters.",

As noted previously, some tenants have installed their own access control systems to operate entry door(s) to tenant areas, possibly in conjunction with CCTV systems, intercoms, and intrusion detection systems. Other large companies who have around-the-clock operations provide security staff or receptionists to control afterhours access. Some maintain an after-hours access register or log similar to that required for the building itself. If the tenant is a restaurant that is open to the public after normal business hours and on weekends and holidays, there will be the need to provide easy access for the patrons and additional measures to ensure these persons cannot stray into other building areas. Doors Locked. It is important that tenants never open their doors after normal business hours for anyone they do not know personally. For example, in an office building a temporary female employee working alone after hours one night opened the door to a man who claimed to be the window washer. The intruder raped the woman, then even had the nerve to say goodnight to the security officer posted in the lobby.

            "text": "There are various property acceptance and removal systems that building managers and tenants can implement to provide some control over the property that on a daily basis is moved in and out of office buildings and tenant areas. The degree of control will vary from building to building and tenant to tenant, and it will depend largely on the policies established by building management and the tenants. The effectiveness of these policies will depend on how thoroughly they are communicated to building staff, tenants, and occupants; how strictly they are enforced; and the support afforded the program. It is sometimes difficult to implement strict property control measures in a multiple-tenant/multiple-use commercial office building, primarily because each tenant may expect a different degree of security. This discussion of property control does not include the means for protecting proprietary information. However, it is appropriate to mention that document destruction either on-site using a shredder or off-site by contract companies, can be an effective means of safeguarding critical information stored in documents that needs to be destroyed. Objectives of a Property Control System. The objectives of a property control system are threefold: 23 1. To prevent stolen property or other unauthorized items from leaving. Stolen property may include computers (personal, laptop, and notebook), personal data assistants, mobile telephones, fax machines, calculators, and general office equipment. An unauthorized item might be a sensitive or a classified document that is not to be removed from a certain area or from the building. 2. To prevent dangerous items entering. Explosives are the usual concern, but other items such as cameras or firearms might be prohibited. (As a result of September 11, 2001 , metal detectors and X-ray systems, although not in common use in office buildings, were deployed in some landmark facilities as a screening measure for weapons and explosive material concealed on people and contained in packages and other containers.) 3. To prevent unnecessary or disruptive delivery traffic. By keeping out misdirected deliveries, unnecessary traffic is avoided. By routing deliveries through proper entrances, such as loading docks and freight/ service elevators, disruptive traffic is avoided and, in some cases, the building and passenger elevators are protected against damage from hand trucks and bulky crates. By intercepting deliveries at these entrances to the building, it may be possible to detect intruders posing as delivery persons. Property Removal Pass System. Unauthorized removal of property from office buildings can be controlled to a degree by requiring property removal passes for business and personal items taken through an egress point controlled by security staff. The time period when the property removal pass system is to be in effect is set by building management and then communicated to the tenants. (Some buildings only permit the checking of property removal after normal business hours.) Building management can supply property removal passes to key tenant representatives who then supervise their distribution to tenant employees and visitors on an as-needed basis. The passes may vary both in design and in the information recorded on them. However, small items can easily be concealed on a person or in a briefcase or a carrying bag. Also, a thief working in a building can circumvent a property control system by using commercial mail services to send stolen items out from the building. Unless electronic tracking of assets is provided, a thief can thereby bypass a building's property control system.",

For high-risk facilities, these inspections might include performing X-rays of entire vehicles, the use of undervehicle scanning systems, and the use of explosive trace detectors or explosives-detection trained (bomb-sniffing) dogs. Couriers and Delivery Persons. In many facilities, couriers and delivery persons, once cleared to enter, can freely move about a building to deliver and pick up letters, packages, and other items from tenants. However, there is an alternative for owners and managers who want to prevent unnecessary, disruptive, or possibly undesirable delivery traffic in their facilities. Some buildings have instituted special programs whereby outside couriers, on arrival at a building, are directed to a separate entrance, such as the loading dock or a central mailroom. At that location, building couriers employed by a contract courier or a security company assigned to the building sign for the items and deliver them within the building by way of the freight/service elevators. When items are to leave the building, these same couriers pick up the articles from the tenants, bring them to the central location, and then outside courier companies sign for them before taking them from the facility. As a rule, major courier services that regularly do multiple deliveries in a building are permitted to perform their own pickups and deliveries. Special deliveries or pickups can be facilitated by providing temporary badges for outside couriers to enter or by providing an escort for these couriers while they are in the building.",

When dedicated building courier or security staff performs multiple deliveries and pickups from tenants, the overall number of couriers roaming throughout a building decreases: a valuable security advance when a million square foot office building may have 300 or more individual deliveries per normal business day. In addition, the number of couriers using elevators is reduced. Also, it can enhance security by providing an added presence in the building (particularly if security staff are used), and because these building couriers should have already been \"security vetted\" (i.e., a background check of these individuals has been conducted), there is less chance of possible theft or vandalism than when using outside courier services. Delivery to secured or normally \"locked-off\" floors is also easier because dedicated building couriers can more readily be entrusted with the access codes or cards that allow them to enter such restricted areas.",

If there is a question about the time property was picked up or delivered or about the individual who signed for it, accurate records should be immediately available for review. Some individual tenants, particularly larger ones that occupy full floors and multiple floors, have addressed the issue of outside couriers roaming within their space by establishing a separate mailroom from which only tenant messengers perform all deliveries within the tenant area. Package Acceptance Policy. During normal business hours, when tenants are usually open for business, they generally accept their own packages. For those delivered after hours, their acceptance or rejection largely depends on the policy established by the building owner or manager. For security and safety reasons, most commercial office buildings do not permit after-hours acceptance of packages by security staff. The building does not want to accept the responsibility and potential liability of accepting packages (including certain legal documents) the tenant may refuse; also, these packages may contain dangerous or illicit items. Some buildings do permit the acceptance of after-hours packages on certain occasions and under special circumstances. This will usually require a written request by the tenant and an explicit understanding that the building and its agents are absolved from any liability resulting from accepting the package on behalf of the tenant. Lost and Found Property. Handling lost and found property is an often-neglected but critical part of an effective security program. Most people can recall the anguish they felt on discovering that a valuable personal possession or business item was missing.

Some jurisdictions allow found property, when its owner is unknown and its value is below a certain amount, to be distributed to local charitable organizations. Others, after a certain waiting period, auction the property or allow the finder to assume ownership of it. Trash Removal Control. There are a number of controls that can be placed on trash removal from tenant space and from a building. The design and implementation of these controls largely depend on the specific cleaning operations in effect at the building. Some operations \"gang clean\" by using a team (including dusters, cleaners, waxers, polishers, and trash removers) to clean tenant spaces and restrooms on a series of floors. Others assign specific janitorial staff to perform all functions on particular floors. From a security standpoint, the latter is preferable because regular staff members are more likely to detect unauthorized persons who do not belong in a particular tenant space, and because investigations involving janitors are easier when the same janitors regularly work in a particular tenant space.",

The holding time permits losses to surface before trash is removed for destruction, thereby facilitating possible retrieval of the item in question. Janitorial Staff Screening. In many buildings, janitorial staff may be required to enter and leave the building through an employee entrance and be subject to certain property screening procedures. The object of the screening procedure is to observe any prohibited items being brought into the building and to detect any stolen property being removed from the building. As part of pre-employment or pre-assignment agreements, janitors may be asked to submit to a visual inspection of any items they are carrying to and from work -lunch pails, bags, backpacks, packages, and other containers.

Some operations require janitorial staff to wear special clothing or smocks in which it is difficult to conceal items. Importance of Controlled Ingress and Egress. The success or failure of any property control system depends largely on whether there are \"controlled\" exits or entries to the facility for use by building occupants and visitors. For example, if building users need to pass through one particular point to enter or leave the building, and if this point sometimes is not supervised, then the property control system can be circumvented. Similarly, if there are other unsupervised exits or entry points, persons can defeat the property control system by using these areas when they want to bring in or take out property.",

This will help control the movement of people (tailgating or piggybacking of passengers will be possible) but will not control property. l Install CCTV cameras in the elevator cars or in the parking garage elevator lobbies. If the cameras are constantly monitored or the images constantly recorded, the unauthorized movement of property might be observed either at the time it occurs or at a later stage. l If possible, reprogram the elevators so that some exclusively service the parking garage and the building main lobby. Passengers traveling up from the parking garage will need to cross to other elevators to proceed to the tower floors. Similarly, passengers traveling down from the tower floors will need to cross over to the garage shuttle elevators to proceed to the parking garage. (Due to the limited numbers of elevators in some buildings and the pedestrian traffic load, such a measure may not be practical due to congestion and extended delays.) Even with this arrangement, to effectively control most property, the main lobby would need to be staffed by trained security personnel. If such staffing is not possible because of budgetary constraints, card readers may be provided in the elevators and CCTV cameras placed inside all elevators or at the parking garage elevator lobbies. By placing the elevators on card access, tenants will be required to use their cards to access floors, thereby providing some degree of access control.

The following points are important to consider: l Tenants and residents should be issued keys that pertain to their particular area only. l Tenants and residents should never be issued building entrance keys. (If issuing entrance keys is unavoidable, the locks should be changed periodically or when a key has been lost or taken, and new keys should be issued to the tenants authorized to have them.) l Tenants and residents should not be allowed to duplicate keys. (Keys should be marked \"Do Not Duplicate\" as a deterrent to duplication. Also, keys issued to tenants may be distinctively marked to help identify unauthorized keys they may have had cut themselves.) l When an employee ceases to work for a tenant, all the employee's keys should be returned to the tenant representative. Depending on the situation, locks may need to be changed. l When a tenant or a resident moves out, all tenant or resident entry door locks should be changed. l Janitorial staff should be issued keys only for the time they require them and for the particular areas to which they require access. Depending on the size of the janitorial staff, designated supervisors within the janitorial operation may be issued master keys that, for instance, provide access to all tenant spaces on an individual floor. In this way, the general cleaning staff does not need to be issued keys. In some buildings, no janitorial staff is issued keys, and security staff must unlock the appropriate doors and relock them after the work is completed. Procedures will vary from building to building depending on size, complexity, and the manner in which cleaning is conducted and trash is removed. l Elevator, escalator, dumbwaiter, chute (rubbish, mail, laundry, and linen), and moving walk technicians may be permitted to carry keys that provide access to their equipment, or the building may retain possession and issue them only as needed. In some buildings, telecommunications technicians, gas, water, and power utility workers are permitted to attach their own locking devices to areas containing their equipment. This practice is convenient because the building staff is not required to open these areas, but it compromises security because control of keys and the areas themselves has been lost. These areas could be used to store unauthorized or stolen items, and general housekeeping may become a problem. If this practice is permitted, no one should be allowed to place a lock on a door without building security or other building departments (such as engineering) having a key. In an emergency, keys must be available for access. A possible alternative is for contractors to store their equipment, including tools, in heavily reinforced, large steel boxes, chests, and cabinets that can be secured using high-security padlocks, which are protected from attack with cutting tools.",

Use posted signs; written policies and procedures published in the Tenant Manual and on the building's Web site; pamphlets, leaflets, flyers, newsletters, e-mails, and video training materials supplied by building management to the tenant or by tenant management to its employees. Sometimes, information is displayed on in-car elevator video screens. Such elevator bulletins may, for example, provide information that reminds occupants that in the event the elevator stops running, they should immediately use the elevator emergency communication device to request assistance, or the bulletins may be used to post other appropriate emergency notifications. 3. Conduct security and safety orientation lectures, classes, briefings, workshops, and seminars. These events can be an effective medium not only for communicating to tenants what is required of them in the building security program, but also as an opportunity to educate employees about basic security and safety measures they can adopt at home. (Such measures could include being aware of their surroundings; elevator safety; securing vehicle doors and windows; not leaving valuable items in view in parked vehicles; securing desks, filing cabinets, laptop computers, computer storage devices, and personal property; and observing a \"clean tabletop\" policy.) The length of such events will vary, but 45 minutes to an hour is probably the maximum that busy tenants will permit. As with all effective teaching, the use of audio-visual aids -films, videotapes, DVDs, and slides -can help gain the participants' attention and assist in effectively communicating the required message. The frequency of classes, meetings, conferences, seminars, and workshops will vary from building to building; they may be regularly scheduled or conducted when a specific need arises. Security training can be incorporated effectively into occupants' fire life safety training classes. More will be said about the training of occupants, floor wardens, and building emergency staff in the next section.",

Public officials may require a particular format for the plan itself. SUMMARY l From the time a vehicle enters an office building parking structure and pedestrians proceed to the building, travel in the tower elevators, and enter an individual tenant space, there is a need for access control measures that sift out unwanted persons and intruders and yet constitute a minimum of inconvenience to legitimate building users. l In multiple-tenant commercial office buildings, the three lines of defense -the main lobby, the elevators and lobbies on each floor, and the entrances to tenant space -provide points at which access can be controlled. l Personal and business property that is moved in and out of an office building and tenant areas must be controlled. To establish a successful property removal control system, there must be supervised egress points through which all property and trash should pass. Tenants are a vital part of security and must be educated in security awareness. l The purpose of establishing, implementing, and maintaining a building emergency management plan is to provide for the life safety of all building occupants.",
