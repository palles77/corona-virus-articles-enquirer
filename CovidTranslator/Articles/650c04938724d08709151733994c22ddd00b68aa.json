(A) Typical field of view in the high-throughput magnetic tweezers assay(Cnossen et al., 2014, Berghuis et al., 2015 where typically ~800 magnetic beads (M270, 2.8 \u03bcm diameter, Life Technology, The Netherlands) are tethered to the coverslip surface with a dsRNA construct(Fig.1B). (B) Array of the experimental conditions (force, NTPs concentration, other reagent added in the reaction buffer) and the statistics for each conditions (bold) in number of dwell times that can be translated in number of nucleotides by multiplying the number of dwell times by the five nucleotides scanning window size. (C) Dwell-time histogram reproduced fromFig.1D, together with a schematic representation of the different ways that PV RdRp may traverse a dwell-time window depending on which state is dominant within that window. The relationship between the corresponding probabilities is indicated. Error bars in this panel are determined as described in Experimental Procedures.Fig.S2 (related to Fig.2): The influence of force on the behavior of PV RdRp. In all panels, error bars are determined as described in Experimental Procedures. (A) The dwelltime distributions assembled from PV RdRp transcription traces acquired at an NTP concentration of 100 \u00b5M for different applied forces(20 pN, black; 25 pN, red; 30 pN, pink; 35  pN, light purple). The solid lines are the MLE fits to a scenario where rapid elongation competes with two long-lived pause states, as illustrated inFig.3G. The kinetic parameters extracted from these fits are shown in panels (B,C). (B) Exit rates out of Pause 1 ( , dark blue) and Pause 2 ( , light blue) as a function of force. (C) Probabilities of finding PV RdRp in Pause 1 ( , dark blue) or Pause 2 ( , light blue) as a function of force.",

(A,B) PV RdRp utilizes CTP and UTP efficiently when T-1106 is in the template. The symmetrical primed template used is referred to as sym/sub-CTUA. The second templating base is T-1106 (T 6 ). PV RdRp was mixed with sym/sub-CTUA and GTP for 3 min to assemble elongation competent complexes, mixed with each NTP for various amounts of time and then quenched. Denaturing polyacrylamide gels showing the reaction products from PV RdRp-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation using the indicated nucleotide and sym/sub-CTUA as substrates. (-) indicates the absence of additional NTP substrate added to the reaction. Both CTP and UTP were efficiently incorporated opposite T-1106 by PV RdRp.

PV RdRp was mixed with: (E) sym/sub-AUCG; (F) s/s-CGAU or (G) s/s-UACG; for 5 min to assemble elongation competent complexes, mixed with 100 \u00b5M NTPs, 16 \u00b5M heparin either in the presence or absence of 1 mM T-1106-TP for various amounts of time and then quenched. Denaturing polyacrylamide gels showing the reaction products from PV RdRp-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation. No substantial impact on RNA synthesis is observed in the presence of T-1106-TP when using the s/s-AUCG and s/s-CGAU substrates, compare lanes NTPs to NTPs + T-1106-TP. There is a small amount of n+2 RNA product observed in the presence of T-1106-TP using s/s-UACG likely due to the incorporation of T-1106-TP opposite adenosine and inhibiting RNA synthesis. Incorporation opposite adenosine results in the production of terminated products or a substantial reduction in the efficiency of incorporation of the next correct nucleotide substrate. As a reference, each templating base is indicated to the right of the denaturing polyacrylamide gel. for PV RdRp, and (D) probability for PV RdRp. We note that the latter probability increases as the relative probability to enter a backtrack rises (Fig.6E) ; this effect is likely due to the overlap of both pause distributions in the presence of T-1106-TP.",
