Human Immunology 39, 177-187 (1994) [1] . Live attenuated RV vaccines, which have been used since 1969 to immunize infants and susceptible women of childbearing age, have successfully reduced disease incidence [2] . Nevertheless, 177 0198-8859/94/$7.00 there are still medical concerns such as primary or secondary vaccine failure and RV vaccine-associated arthritis (RAA). RAA occurs acutely in approximately 10%-15% of previously seronegative women receiving the currently used live attenuated RA27/3 strain of RV vaccine [3] . Of those affected, a significant proportion have been reported to develop chronic and debilitating joint manifestations [1, 3, 4] . Whether this is due to primary immunologic failure leading to RV persistence in joint tissues [5] or virus-induced autoimmunity is still unresolved. Hence, there is an indication for the development of an improved second-generation (peptide, recombinant protein, or modified infectious virus) vaccine by employing only those antigenic regions known to give rise to protective immunity.",

Evidence from other virus studies has indicated a central role for CD4 + T cells in the induction of specific immune responses to virus antigens (Ags) as represented in synthetic peptides (SPs) [7, 8t . It is also known that CD4 + T cells recognize foreign Ags not in their native form but as small peptides that are presented as a complex with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on the surface of Ag-presenting cells [9] . Hence, identification of relevant antigenic sites by using SPs representative of the primary sequence of a candidate vaccine Ag, and characterization of the HLA restriction elements involved in peptide presentation to T cells, could facilitate design of a more effective RV vaccine [ 10] .",

From these initial studies, several cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones were isolated by limiting dilution [22, 23] , and their specificities were determined in standard 51Cr_release assays, using autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines (EBV-BLs) sensitized with SPs as targets. Two T-cell clones   were selected for this study: ATRVC2, isolated from a  T-cell line stimulated by UV-inactivated RV; and  AT177C5, derived from a T-cell line stimulated by the  SP E1(273-291 ). Preliminary investigations revealed that both were specific for an antigenic site (or sites) lying within residues (273-291) of RV E1 protein, a domain previously shown to be the target of RVneutralizing antibodies [15, 17] . These findings suggested that this region might contain overlapping T-and B-cell antigenic sites that could be potentially useful components of a modified RV vaccine. To understand better the role this antigenic region plays in protective immunity and in the interaction between T and B cells, the exact antigenic sites recognized by each clone and the MHC class II restriction elements involved in their presentation were defined.",

Both showed identical antigenic specificity for E 1(273-284) and behaved as cytotoxic T cells. If this phenotype is predominant in the in vivo response to this antigenic region, then these cells could function in either immune protection (by direct elimination of RV-infected cells) or adverse immunoreactivity (by destruction of synovial cells persistently infected with RV). These clones exhibited identical specificity despite having been generated with different antigenic stimuli. Moreover, both recognized not only the E 1 SPs but also naturally processed peptides from wild-type (M33) and attenuated RV vaccine strains (RA27/3 and HPV77), as well as recombinant RV E 1 protein.

            "text": "To delineate which residues within E 1(273-291) were critical for immune recognition by these CTL clones, truncated SPs spanning this region were compared for their capacity to target specific cytotoxicity. Results showed that E 1(273-284) was the shortest sequence capable of eliciting maximal cytotoxicity, while E1(272-282), the smallest antigenic SP evaluated, induced somewhat lower levels of killing. Rothbard and Taylor [32] and Rothbard and Gefter [33] have identified a primary sequence motif characteristic of T-cell antigenic sites consisting of 4-5 aa, including a charged residue or glycine, followed by 2-3 hydrophobic aa, then either a polar residue or glycine. Within E1(273-284), such a motif (EVWVT) was identified (Fig. 4) . To assess the role played by individual residues, four single aa-substituted analogues of SP E 1(273-284) were evaluated in cytotoxicity assays. Results showed that substituting a hydrophobic residue for a charged or polar one at position 273 or 277 substantially reduced cytotoxicity, indicating that these amino acids are important for recognition. Moreover, replacement of a nonpolar aa (W) at position 275 with an acidic aa (E) or replacement of a polar aa (T) with relatively larger-size residue (Y) at position 277 obliterated specific cytotoxicity. Hence, W-275 and T-277 appear to play a critical role in immune recognition of this sequence by these particular CTL clones. De Lisi and Berzofsky have proposed another model in which T-cell determinants correlated with amphipathic ot-helic structures in antigenic proteins [34] . The RV E1 sequence, EVWVT, is also located at the maximum of o~-helix indexes within residues 273-291 as determined from s-helix and [3-turn potentials and hydrophilicity plots of E 1 [ 14] . mAb experiments and cytotoxicity assays performed with different EBV-BLs confirmed that the HLA-DR4 subtypes DR4Dwl3A (DRBI*0403), DR4Dwl3B (DRB 1.0407), and DR4KT2 (DRB 1.0406) could serve as restriction elements for presentation of E 1(273-284) in this case. Furthermore, the DR [31 chain of the autologous EBV-BL, AT, was shown to have a nucleic acid sequence identical to DRB 1.0403. The molecular diversity of HLA-DR4 haplotypes is well known [35] , and at least 12 DR4 subtypes expressing different class II [~1 chains have been identified [28] . It is believed that the critical residues involved in Ag presentation by DR4 subtypes are located on the first domain of the HLA-DR4 ~1 chain, which shows the most variability [28, 35] . DR4Dw13A, DR4Dw13B, and DR4KT2, which were able to present E1(273-284) to the T-cell clones, differed significantly from the other DR4 subtypes at position 74, with a unique substitution (E for A). Such a charge change could influence immune recognition either by modifying peptide conformation or its interaction with the T-cell receptor (TcR). Alanine (A)-74 in the DR4 [~ 1 chain has been reported to be important in T-cell allo-or autoreactivity [36, 37] . A proposed HLA-DR-binding model consists of a core sequence of six amino acids involving a large hydrophobic residue separated by four amino acids from a small residue [38, 39] . O'Sullivan et al. [40, 41] also proposed a similar nineresidue motif composed of an aromatic or hydrophobic aa in position 1, followed by a noncharged and relatively small residue in position 6, and another relatively hydrophobic one in position 9. As predicted from these models and from the data presented herein, it is highly likely that the V-274 or W-275 and the V-279 or 1-280, respectively, represent the first and second hydrophobic anchor residues for binding to HLA-DR4. The third or more allele-specific anchor residue is likely the S-282 (Fig. 4) . Hence, these appear to be critical in both binding of the epitope, E1(273-284) to HLA-DR4 and its recognition by the T-cell clones in this study ( Fig. 2 and Table 2 ). Investigations are in progress to confirm the interaction of these critical residues with the HLA-DRbinding groove, or TcR. The results will determine the influence of residue 74-E in DR4 131 chain on peptide binding. The results of this clonal analysis revealed an antigenic site E1(273-284), that appeared to be highly restricted in its presentation to T cells and, as such, may not be very good for incorporation into a new RV vaccine. Yet residues 273-284 lie within a broader region of RV E 1(268-291), which appears to be widely recognized on a population basis by both T cells [19, 21] and antibodies [15, 17] from individuals of diverse MHC backgrounds. Why would such an antigenic site located within a predicted immunodominant region exhibit such high specificity of MHC restriction? One possible explanation is that the HLA-DR4 subtype-restricted sequence identified here represents only one of several clustered antigenic sites lying within E1 residues 268-291. Alternatively, there may exist in the human T-cell repertoire other TcRs capable of recognizing residues 273-284 in the context of other MHC class II molecules. Investigations are currently under way to determine whether this is the case. It is notable, however, that the HLA-DR4 phenotype has been associated with autoimmunity in other disease systems [42] , as has restricted TcR V (13) gone usage [43] . It is also of interest that the antigenic site recognized by the CTL clones described here overlaps almost completely with a previously defined [ 17] neutralizing antibody-binding domain (EP 1), suggesting that the apparent overlap between a class II HLA-restricted T-cell antigenic site and an antibody recognition site may not simply be fortuitous but may reflect a mechanistic link between Ag presentation and T-cell help for antibody synthesis. Overlapping B-and T-cell determinants could facilitate Ag uptake by B cells bearing surface Ag receptors of the appropriate specificity, followed by Ag processing and presentation by the B-cell HLA class II to the T cell, forming an \"antigen bridge\" to focus the appropriate T cells onto B cells [44] .",

Future studies will determine whether this sequence may be recognized by other human TcRs in the context of other MHC class II molecules, and the phenotypes of the responding T cells, to assess its suit-ability as a component of second-generation RV vaccines.
