In continuously updated epidemic curves, case numbers for the most recent epidemic week or day usually appear to be lower than the previous, suggesting a decline of the epidemic. In reality however, the epidemic curve may still be on the rise, because reporting delay prevents the most recent cases to already appear in the case count. This phenomenon often introduces misperceptions in the general public and in media coverage as can again be seen in the current COVID-19 epidemic. 1 Reporting delay can be decomposed into several parts: (a) the time passing from symptom onset until the patient seeks medical service, (b) the time passing between this service and initiation of a laboratory test, (c) the time between this test initiation and completion of its result, (d) the time between test completion and its registration at the local health authority level and (e) the time passing from transmitting the case report from that local level to the (usually national) health authority level that will generate and publish the epidemic curve. 2 Technology and rapid procedures can minimize the delay occurring from the first contact with the health care system and appearance of a case in the daily case count at national level, but they can hardly reduce the delay between appearance of first symptoms and contact to the health care service. 2 The latter is subject to a variety of factors such as severity of the disease, public awareness for it, individual benefit to seek health services, accessibility to those services, some of which may also be subject to change during an epidemic. For all those reasons, reporting delay is not only specific to a country and its surveillance and health care system, but to the disease in questions and the phase of the epidemic.",

We demonstrate the approach with data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, because of its high case counts, accessibility to data details and the particular importance of such an approach for the risk assessment for the upcoming Summer Olympic Games, hosted in Tokyo, July to August 2020. The aim of this approach is to reduce and transparently display uncertainty on the real time status of epidemic curves.",

On March 6 th 2020, nCoV-2019 Data Working Group contained 204 cases (excluding all cases from the Diamond Princess and with the last case reported on March 2 nd 2020), of which 131 (64%) contained date of symptom onset and date of case confirmation. For the remaining 73 (36%) cases without information on symptom onset, we assume that the case still had a symptom onset date and it is just missing, because it could not be readily identified. We imputed the respective date using a generalized additive Weibull regression model for both the scale and shape parameter with week of confirmation as a covariate. 13 The now-casting approach consists of a Bayesian approach for modelling delay by which case reports appear in the continuously updated epidemic curve (also known as reporting triangle) and provides full predictive distributions for the daily delay-adjusted number of symptom onsets. 10 We used a sliding window of the past 14 days to estimate the time-varying delay distribution, in order to account for the assumption that the reporting delay decreases as the outbreak progresses, due to aforementioned changes in the health care seeking and reporting procedures. Uncertainty of the delay imputation was transported by repeating the imputation 100 times and averaging the resulting now-casting quantities.",

            "text": "Public awareness is likely to have a major impact on surveillance sensitivity and also timeliness 18 : The WHO reported the first Corona case in Japan on January 20 th 2020, with four additional cases on January 25 th . During this time, the media had already reported intensively about COVID-19 and therefore public awareness was likely to have been already high. When the first case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in China on December 1 st 2019, the Japanese National Institute of Diseases established a real time PCR for this type of virus until January 16 th 2020. Furthermore, a telephone hotline for professionals within the health system and public communications were activated. 19 These and other activities may explain why the reporting delay in Japan was fairly short to begin with and diminished further as the outbreaks progressed, compared to COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries. 3 The delays displayed for calendar week nine as part of the imputation might experience a small downwards bias due to cases with long delays not being available at the date of query, however, this is then later taken into account by nowcasting.",

As illustrated per 95% prediction intervals in figure 3 , uncertainty of now-casts is obviously highest for the days are closest to the actual day of the now-cast itself. We used publicly available data for our analysis, which tends to be less complete than the data available to national surveillance agencies. This slightly limits the precision of our now-cast, but also indicates the even higher value of now-casting when used within a nation's surveillance system. For this reason, we are currently building this tool as a permanent functionality into the dashboard of the Surveillance Outbreak Response Management System (www.sormas.org) to further enhance its role in COVID-19 response. [20] [21] [22] [23] Via the open-source R package surveillance applied within the user-friendly shiny application, public health surveillance institutions can easily apply this now-cast approach in their country for COVID-19 or any other disease. No system or country specific configurations are needed. As a specific use case this tool may be of particular value for the challenging risk assessment and risk communication in the context of the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo July to August 2020 and similar situations elsewhere.
