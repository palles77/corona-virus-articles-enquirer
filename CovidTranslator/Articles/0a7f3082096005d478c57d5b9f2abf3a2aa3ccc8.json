At present, no specific treatment has been identified for SARS-associated coronavirus infection.

Of all the compounds, glycyrrhizin was the most active in inhibiting replication of the SARS-associated virus. Our findings suggest that glycyrrhizin should be assessed for treatment of SARS.",

However, the rate of progression of these lesions is uncertain. We aimed to assess the progression of lesions in community-dwelling volunteers aged 50-75 years without neuropsychiatric disease. We used MRI to grade and measure the total volume of white matter lesions in 296 volunteers at baseline, 3 years, and 6 years. 58 participants with no lesions and 123 with punctate abnormalities at baseline had a low tendency for lesion progression, whereas 14 participants with early confluent and nine with confluent lesions underwent median increases of 2\u00b77 cm 3 (IQR 0\u00b75-5\u00b79) and 9\u00b73 cm 3 (7\u00b71-21\u00b70), respectively, in lesion volume at 6 years. Lesion grade at baseline was the only significant predictor of lesion progression (p<0\u00b70001). Punctate white matter lesions are not progressive and are thus benign, whereas early confluent and confluent white matter abnormalities are progressive, and thus malignant. Some degree of cerebral white matter change is almost endemic in elderly people. Lesions progress, 1-3 but in which individuals is unclear. At the extreme end of the spectrum, full-blown dementia corresponds with diffuse demyelination and arteriolosclerosis. 4 We aimed to assess the volume change of white matter lesions during 6 years in a community-dwelling cohort.",

Glycyrrhizin had a low selectivity index, but was a significantly potent inhibitor of replication of all the viruses tested. The EC 50 reported by these authors for glycyrrhizin was 316-625 mg/L (added twice during the incubation period of 7 days). Taking into consideration that the compounds were added twice during the total period of incubation, the EC 50 for glycyrrhizin we recorded (table) indicates a higher sensitivity of SARS-CV to this drug than that recorded by Crance and colleagues.",

The resulting low concentrations of P24 antigen in patients with HIV-1 who were given this compound has been attributed to upregulation of chemokines. Infrequent side-effects such as raised blood pressure and hypokalaemia were reported in some patients after several months of glycyrrhizin treatment. Treatment of SARS should only be needed for a short time. Since the side-effects of this compound are known and can be controlled for, proper monitoring could lead to effective use of glycyrrhizin as a treatment for SARS. Booth and colleagues 5 reported that ribavirin had many toxic effects when given to patients with SARS, including haemolysis (76% of patients) and a drastic reduction of haemoglobin (49% of patients). However, although high doses of glycyrrhizin have been used in clinical trials, this compound had few toxic effects compared with the other regimens, and the drug was reported to be clinically effective.",
