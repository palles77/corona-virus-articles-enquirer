Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility. Besides, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings may explain the clinical symptoms so far and help clinicians and researchers understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV. : medRxiv preprint GO biological process annotation gmt file was downloaded from MSigDB (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/). GSEA was performed to analyze the possible biological processes related to ACE2 in healthy people using clusterProfiler (12) . The parameters were nPerm = 1000, minGSSize = 10, maxGSSize = 500, the biological processes with p-value < 0.05 were considered significant. GSVA was performed using GSVA R package. The immune infiltrating was quantified using the ssGSEA method in GSVA R package. The gene list for immune cells was derived from Bindea G et al.(13).",

Later, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV was identified based on sequencing of the patient respiratory tract samples. As of February 1, 2020, more than 10,000 confirmed patients and more than 15,000 suspected cases were reported in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. Analyzing of the genome of 2019-nCoV showed that this new virus shared around 80~90% sequence identity to SARS-CoV (2) . Both bioinformatics modeling and in vitro experiments indicated that 2019-nCoV was more likely to use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor (3, 4) . ACE2 is previously known as the receptor for SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 (5, 6) . Considering the sequence of 2019-nCoV is similar to the SRAS-CoV and they are reported to share the same molecular as the entry point, analyses of ACE2 expression and distribution in lung and related biological processes may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV. Recent advances in bioinformatics enable researchers to reveal the underlying mechanisms of various diseases. In this study, we used bioinformatics approaches to identify the ACE2 expression features in lung and mine associated regulating networks. These results may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV.",

Similarly, while ACE2 increased after infection, production of cytokines, IL-1, IL-10 and IL-6 also increased, and the regulation of B cell activation was triggered to response. After 48 hours, virus activities such as viral entry into the host cell, virus life cycle, and viral transcription were enhanced. Besides, the T-cell cytokine secretion was increased, and T-cell activation was promoted ( Figure 2B ). Then, we used ssGSEA (Single Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) to quantify the immune infiltrates in healthy people epithelial cells and cells after infection. We found that in normal samples, the immune cells were not activated so that the correlation between infiltration and ACE2 expression was not significant ( Figure 2C ).

This implies that the up-regulation of ACE2 could mediate the inflammatory responses which were induced by above-mentioned cytokines. Moreover, higher expression of ACE2 could prolong virus life cycle, enhance virus replication and mediate penetration of the virus into the host cell.",

            "text": "Wuhan is a serious public health problem. As the number of cases has been increasing and the scope of infection has been expanding, people keep a close eye on the future development of the epidemic. Based on the data of the first 41 patients, the reduction of lymphocytes was a prominent feature of the laboratory examination. The main symptoms of patients with 2019-nCoV infection were interstitial changes in the lung according to the chest CT. Moreover, severe pulmonary interstitial disease led to hypoxemia and type I respiratory distress, which was related to the prognosis of patients. 2019-nCoV invades the lungs through the respiratory tract and causes severe pneumonia, which is the main pathogenesis mode. It was found that 2019-nCoV was able to bind to ACE2 receptor on the surface of epithelial cells. At the beginning of the outbreak, Dong N et al. calculated and simulated that 2019-nCoV may have the same ACE2 receptor as SARS, although its binding ability to ACE2 was weaker than SARS. Zhou P et at. further confirmed that ACE2 was necessary for the cells infected by 2019-nCoV(4). In this study, six independent studies (GSE37758, GSE73395, GSE89809, GSE63127, GSE97010, and GSE14700) were analyzed, covering healthy population, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, bronchial asthma patients and smoking patients. The samples included lung tissue, BALF, airway epithelial cells, small airway epithelial cells and coronavirus infected epithelial cells. We showed that ACE2 was found in all of the samples including healthy population and patients with chronic airway diseases. It revealed that there was no significant difference in the susceptibility of 2019-nCoV between healthy population and patients with chronic airway diseases. The expression of ACE2 was up-regulated in smokers, suggesting that smoking may increase the susceptibility of new coronavirus. Further analysis showed that the expression of ACE2 could be up-regulated by SARS coronavirus infection.",

            "text": "ACE2 was related to the symptoms called cytokine storm. The clinical study in Wuhan pointed that the levels of IL-1B, IL-10 and IL-8 were significantly increased in critically ill patients with new coronavirus infection, indicating that there was cytokine mediated inflammatory responses in patients with coronavirus infection(9). At the same time, our results also showed that the high expression of ACE2 increased the expression of genes involved in viral replication, which was beneficial for the virus to enter the host cells. These gene enrichments were consistent with those of the epithelial cells infected by coronavirus. It suggested that the transcriptome of epithelial cells was altered after the infection of coronavirus though the regulation of ACE2, which was beneficial to the replication and assembly of virus, and also to the entry of virus into host cells. Meanwhile, T cell activation and inflammatory response mediated by T cell factors were significantly induced by the alteration of transcriptome as well. It was speculated that the increased levels of IL1B, IFN \u03b3, IP10, and MCP1 in patients infected with new coronavirus were linked to the activation of T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses(9). However, there is a lack of pathological data of lung tissue infected with new coronavirus. Through ssGSEA analysis, we found the correlation between ACE2 and immune cell infiltration. The results showed that the high expression of ACE2 in lung tissue was beneficial to induce cytotoxic reaction, neutrophil inflammation and Th2-dominated immune response. Moreover, the expression of ACE2 was in a time-dependent manner after the virus infection. In the meantime, ACE2 mediated the activations of neutrophils, NK cells, Th17 cells, Th2 cells, Th1 cells, DC cells, TNF\u03b1 secreting cells, which induced more serious inflammatory response.",
