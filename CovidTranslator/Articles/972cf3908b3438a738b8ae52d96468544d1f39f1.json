LBC rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells were susceptible only if the cells were treated with diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D). A recent report that RCVs grow well in L2 mouse fibroblast cells was confirmed and expanded. RCV infection of L2 cells was substantially enhanced by treatment of cells with trypsin but not by treatment with DEAE-D. Primary isolation of SDAV from experimentally infected rats was accomplished using trypsin-treated L2 cells. One of 13 additional cell lines tested (rat urinary bladder epithelium, RBL-02) supported growth of RCVs, and growth was slightly enhanced by DEAE-D, but not by trypsin. These refinements of in vitro growth conditions for RCVs should facilitate further studies of their basic biology and improve options for primary isolation.",

Diagnostic and experimental studies of RCVs have been limited by the lack of a reliable cell line in which to grow the viruses [7] . RCVs have traditionally been grown in primary rat kidney (PRK) cells or infant mouse brain but these techniques require the use of animals and are labor intensive. Although many coronaviruses have fastidious growth requirements, replicating only in organ cultures or cell lines derived from the animal or tissue of origin, cell lines supporting growth of most coronaviruses have been identified [5, 7] . Attempts to grow SDAV in a variety of rodent cell lines, including mouse neuroblastoma (clone N18) cells, C6 rat glial cells, and MHV-susceptible cell lines such as NCTC 1469 cells failed (L. E. Garlinghouse and A. L. Smith, unpubl, data) . Recently H i r a n o et al. reported that a rat m a m m a r y adenocarcinoma cell line (LBC) supported R C V growth [-4] , and Percy et al. reported that L2 cells supported R C V s [11] . In studies reported here, L B C cells, L2 cells and 13 other cell lines o f rodent origin were tested for their susceptibility to RCVs. A rat bladder epithelial cell line (RBL-02) was identified which supports R C V growth. M e d i u m containing trypsin or diethylaminoethyl-dextran ( D E A E -D ) , which have been used to enhance the growth of other coronaviruses [17, 19] , also differentially enhanced R C V growth in selected cell lines.",

Mouse mortality at each dilution was recorded for 14 days. L2 (Percy) cells were observed daily for CPE and were stained for viral antigen 72h after inoculation. Titers expressed as LDs0 or TCIDs0 per ml were calculated [12] . tibility of L2 (Percy) cells to PRCV was erratic. Less than 5% of the monolayer formed syncytia, and antigen-positive cells ( < 5%) were seen on the first passage in half of the attempts, whereas PRCV growth was not detected in the remaining attempts. Seven additional passages did not enhance PRCV growth.",

Of the cell lines and treatments tested, L2 (Percy) cells treated with trypsin supported maximal growth of RCVs as evidenced by syncytium formation and viral antigen. RCV growth in L2 (Percy) cells was not enhanced by trypsin treatment of later passages when the enzyme was added at the time of virus inoculation. Adding trypsin at a different time in the RCV replicative cycle might enhance RCV growth in successive passages. As previously reported by Percy etal.

Repeated passage of other animal-adapted RCV strains in L2 (Percy) cells may accomplish adaptation and increased virus yield.",

The use of trypsin-treated L2 (Percy) cells to screen tissues for RCVs would significantly reduce animal use and expense. However, L2 (Percy) cells were about 2 log10 less sensitive than infant mice based on comparative titration of SDAV-681. This may have been due to adaptation of stock SDAV-681 to infant mouse brain by virtue of multiple prior passages in mice. If trypsin-treated L2 (Percy) cells are inherently less sensitive than infant mice, tissues that are virus-negative by assay in these cells should be re-tested in mice to eliminate false negatives. Uninfected L2 (Percy) cells are morphologically heterogeneous and sensitive to tissue toxicity; therefore, antigen detection which is less subjective than interpretation of morphologic changes should be the definitive test used after cell culture inoculation.",
