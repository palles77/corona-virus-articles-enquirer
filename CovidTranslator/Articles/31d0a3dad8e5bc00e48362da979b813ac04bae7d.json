            "text": "referral. 45 (86.5%) UCCs charged a fee to test uninsured patients, but no UCC could provide a definitive answer regarding test fees for insured patients given the shifting federal legislation. 53 (94.6%) UCCs charged a visit fee in addition to the COVID-19 lab test fee. For the 49 centers that provided the wait time for test results, the median time was 120 hours (interquartile range 96 hours to 144 hours). Of UCCs that did not offer testing, 97 (51.3%) referred individuals to other clinics that could possibly test for COVID-19, and 37 (24.8%) directly referred individuals to a specific emergency department. In the ten states with the greatest COVID-19 caseload, only 23% of UCCs offered COVID-19 testing. Additionally, results would take approximately five days to be processed. Although time to test results at public/state labs are typically 24-48 hours (Table 1), time to test results at UCCs were longer as most samples are sent to external labs. However, it remains unclear whether UCC ability to obtain test samples may be unmatched by the ability to process tests. This finding underscores the importance of point-of-care testing that can rapidly detect COVID-19, particularly because severe disease peaks at approximately ten days from onset of initial symptoms. 3 Fees and cost-sharing for COVID-19 tests remain unclear.
