The end of the sM gene and the beginning of the M gene overlap and we have previously examined this region for many strains isolated in the 1980s in the U.K. and the Netherlands and for a large number of Massachusetts serotype strains isolated in the U.S.A. and Europe [2] . Therefore we examined this part of the genome in respect of 11 of the pre-1970 U.K. isolates and compared the sequences with the consensus sequence of 12 Massachusetts serotype strains ( Fig. 1) . Two of the 11 isolates (Allen/47 and 265/66) differed by only one nucleotide from the consensus sequence of the Massachusetts serotype, a similarity subsequently confirmed by sequencing of the S 1 gene. The remaining nine isolates differed substantially from Massachusetts serotype strains and eight of them formed a recognisable group on the basis of a six nucleotide deletion, effectively making the M protein two amino acids shorter at the extreme amino-terminus compared with Massachusetts strains. The remaining isolate (604/67) had a nine base deletion but was otherwise similar to the other eight strains. This particular six/nine nucleotide deletion was one that we had not encountered previously except for one 1980s isolate, UK/101/86 (Fig. 1) . The sequence of three other 1980s strains, representative of three different deletion types, is shown for comparison in Fig. 1 .",

The four other 1960s strains for which S 1 data was obtained resembled 918/67 more than M 41. However, variation among these 1960s isolates was 3-to 5-fold greater in regions I-IV than in the corresponding regions of a group of 12 Massachusetts serotype strains [4, 5] and 3-to 4-fold greater in regions I-III and 6-to 10-fold more in region IV than in a group of seven 1980s strains [6] . Thus, even when the M 41-like strains were excluded, the remaining 1960s isolates formed a rather heterogeneous group. One of the most variable S I regions (M 41 nucleotide sequence 270 to 394, excluding the signal sequence) contained an additional 15 contiguous bases for some of the non-Massachusetts-like 1960s strains (demonstrated for 225/67, 690/67, and 918/67), which largely accounted for the greater length of S 1 of these strains when compared with published sequences (data not shown). These bases were located between nucleotides 369 and 370 (amino acids 123 and 124) in the M4t sequence. Isolate 48/65 had nine rather than 15 additional bases at this position. These amino acids were within a region (site E) which, for many 1980s strains, induced VN antibodies [14] .",

The more recent isolate 101/86 had a sM/M region which resembled that of most of the 1960s strains (Fig. 1 ) which led us to believe that it was directly related of them. However, S 1 data suggested otherwise (Table 2) . Rather, it would appear that the major IBV strains present in the U.K. during the 1980s either were absent in the 1960s, were present only at a low level or were possibly located in other areas from which virus isolations had not been attempted. It is possible that the later strains had evolved directly from the earlier ones, the process having been disguised by a high mutation rate, of the order of 20% in a decade or so. However, this seems unlikely. Analysis of Massachusetts serotype strains isolated over a half century period has indicated that rapid mutation is not necessarily intrinsic to IBV [-4, 6] . Some strains isolated between 1978 and 1986 in the Netherlands and the U.K. differed by only 2% or so of S 1 nucleotides, again counter-indicative of rapid mutation rates [1, 6, 13, 15, 17] . Rather it would appear that the strains dominant in the U.K. 25 years ago have declined and been replaced by others. Analysis, by VN tests, of 1980s strains indicated that a similar change in the U.K. IBV population was occurring during the 1980s [8] .",

Our results emphasise that, on the one hand, IBV strains with 20% differences in S 1 can coexist over a relatively small area, while on the other that the IBV population in a given area is in a state of flux.",
