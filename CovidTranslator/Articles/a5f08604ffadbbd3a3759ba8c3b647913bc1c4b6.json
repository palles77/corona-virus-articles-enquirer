However, because the neutralizing antibody response is low in young infants, vaccines that mimic natural infection may be ineffective if administered to infants before they reach 4 months of age [6] . Maternal antibodies are associated with a lower risk of infection in infants when antibody titers are maintained above the level considered protective during early infancy [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, an alternative vaccination strategy would be to transfer high concentrations of RSV-specific antibody via maternal vaccination, which could provide protection to infants up to 6 months of age, and to combine this approach with active vaccination in infants [10] .",

The serial interval, which is almost equivalent to the generation time [16] , is defined as the duration between symptom onset of a primary case and symptom onset of a secondary case. R 0 depends on various factors, so it varies between epidemics associated with the same pathogen [17] . Several studies on RSV transmission dynamics, including R 0 , have been conducted to understand RSV seasonality [18, 19] .

The territory comprises 1 main island and several small islands and has 8 municipalities. We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study in 2 municipalities, Caibiran and Kawayan, from March 2014 to June 2016. Children <5 years old were identified through household visits and were invited to participate in the study. We enrolled 2348 households with 4012 children as cohort participants. We asked the caregivers of these children to record respiratory symptoms including cough, coryza, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, chest indrawing, and fever every day. Nurses conducted biweekly household visits to check these written records. We collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) from children who developed fever and either cough or difficulty in breathing within 7 days from household visit onset. In addition, when children with respiratory symptoms such as cough, difficulty in breathing, or coryza visited health facilities, we collected NPSs. The health facilities were the Biliran Provincial Hospital, Naval (capital of Biliran Province), a secondary-level referral and the only hospital in Biliran Province, and rural health units of Caibiran and Kawayan, where qualified doctors provide outpatient care. The specimens were stored in a viral transport medium at 4\u00b0C and transported with an ice pack to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila for laboratory work. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the RITM (2008-05-10, 2013-2) and ethics committee of the Tohoku University School of Medicine, Miyagi, Japan (2012-1-5, 2012-1-63).",

Thus, a total of 212 RSV-ARI were identified, which included 181 RSV-ARI as a primary case (152 single RSV-ARI and 29 1st RSV-ARI), and 31 2nd RSV-ARI of which onset dates were after the 1st RSV-ARI. However, 2 2nd RSV-ARI cases had the same date of onset. Supplementary Table 1 shows the RSV-ARI cases found in RSV-HH2. We found only 5 2nd RSV-ARI episodes in young infants (<6 months old) (see Supplementary Table 1) . Although, the infection source of 31 young infants identified as a single RSV-ARI in RSV-HH1 remained unclear ( Table 1) . One of the objectives of this study was to define the infection source, especially in young infants. Because we conducted a household visit biweekly, we could not collect a specimen from all of ARI episodes. It was possible that other children <5 years old with ARI were a potential source of RSV infection for young infants. Therefore, we further analyzed ARI cases without samples from children <5 years old of RSV-HH1, including preceding ARI or subsequent ARI cases, by assuming that these ARI cases were probably due to RSV. (Table 3) . A summary of total preceding cases and total subsequent ARI cases is shown in Supplementary Figure 3 . We calculated the interval between the dates of onset of 1st RSV-ARI and 2nd RSV-ARI for 31 pairs of children with RSV-ARI in 29 RSV-HH2 households. We did not include RSV-HH1 in this analysis because only 1 case in the household was confirmed as RSV-ARI. The highest interval frequencies were observed on days 1 and 2 (n = 7; 22.6% each) (see Supplementary Figure 4 ). The estimated mean serial interval was 3.2 days (95% CI, 2.5-3.8), 3.2 days (95% CI, 2.5-3.9), and 3.2 days (95% CI, 2.5-4.1) in the gamma, Weibull, and log-normal distributions, respectively.

The RSV-positive older children aged 1 year and 2-4 years caused a higher rate of possible secondary cases (30.3% and 32.4%, respectively) than infants, especially young infants (11.9% for young infants).

These results indicated that RSV infection is more likely to pass from older children to infants in a household and that infants are more susceptible to RSV infection. Young infants are especially vulnerable to severe RSV infection [5] . One of the most important objectives of the RSV vaccine is to protect young infants from RSV infections. There are possible approaches to protecting young infants from RSV infections: infant vaccination, maternal vaccination, and a combination of the 2. However, because both infant vaccination and maternal vaccination have significant challenges, an alternative approach is vaccination of children 6 months old or older [10] . This alternative approach assumes that most young infants acquire RSV infection from older children, especially from their older siblings. The results of this study also support this assumption.",

The 95% CI for the estimated mean serial interval in this study did not cover 1 and 2 days, which were the most frequently observed serial intervals of dates of onset between confirmed RSV-ARI cases in the same household. This means that cases with a serial interval of 1 or 2 days might not have gotten the infection from the household index case and that the real source might actually be the same source as the household index case. In this study, we assumed that 2 or more RSV-ARI cases in the same household had the same source only when they had the same date of onset, although there is no consensus among researchers on this [13] . If RSV-ARI cases with a serial interval of 1 and 2 days had the same source of infection, the actual serial interval is likely to be longer. Further studies are necessary to define the serial interval that should be considered as a common source of infection [27] . In addition, a serial interval in the same household or other close contact settings tends to be shorter than that in community settings because more extensive exposure can lead to a shorter serial interval [28] . Although different RSV subgroups may show a different serial interval, we could not analyze subgroup-specific serial intervals. In this study, we also estimated R 0 for different times (2014 and 2015) and places (Kawayan and Caibiran). We found that R 0 varied between times and places. In particular, for RSV-B in Caibiran in 2015, R 0 was high, and significantly large outbreaks were observed in 2015. We often see different patterns of RSV epidemics, including the total size [29] . These differences may be due to different factors such as the level of herd immunity for each RSV subgroup. Studies have also reported that the emergence of a new genotype within the same subgroup caused a larger epidemic [30] . Studies on RSV transmission dynamics are still limited, and epidemiological parameters such as serial intervals and R 0 have been obtained so far from limited data. In this study, it was not possible to analyze the factors affecting RSV transmission dynamics, because we conducted the study for only 2 years in 2 geographic locations. Considering the significant variations of R 0 we observed in this study, more data from different epidemics should be obtained to estimate epidemiological parameters accurately, which is necessary to establish more effective interventions, including vaccination strategies.",

            "text": "This study had several limitations. First, we did not collect specimens for RSV testing from all RSV-ARI cases. We considered episodes that occurred in the same household within 10 days before and after onset of a confirmed case as possible RSV-ARI cases, which might have overestimated RSV transmission among children in the household. Second, we did not consider asymptomatic cases in our analysis. A previous study has reported that 17.3% of RSV infections are asymptomatic among children <5 years old and that these asymptomatic cases play an important role as a source of transmission [31] . Third, since we collected the data of ARI episodes and clinical specimen only from children <5 years old, we could not capture the entire picture of household RSV transmission. In total, there was no possible index case for approximately 70% (44 of 62) of the young infants with RSV. A previous study has shown that parents and school-age children also play an important role as a source of RSV infection for infants [13] . Moreover, we could estimate R 0 by using the cases <5 years old. There might be a secondary case infected by children <5 years old. Therefore, R 0 in our analysis might be underestimated, and further study is warranted to understand RSV transmissibility among entire population including \u22655 years old. Fourth, we did not consider RSV transmission from outside the household. For example, contact with playmates and other infants in a day care center might be an important source of infection for infants. It is possible that they acquired RSV infection outside of the household. However, we could not analyze this possibility due to the study design. More detailed epidemiological studies, including social network analysis, are required to understand the complete RSV transmission dynamics. Despite these limitations, we managed to gain insight into RSV transmission patterns in a household, especially for young infants. We also estimated epidemiological parameters, such as the serial interval and R 0 . We believe that accumulation of such data in different settings will help establish more effective control measures against RSV in the future.",

Although there is a need for further careful and in-depth epidemiological research, children more than 6 months old may be a potential target for vaccination to prevent RSV transmission from them to young infants. In addition, epidemiological parameters to understand RSV transmission dynamics, such as R 0 , might vary between epidemics and have important implications for evaluating the effectiveness of future interventions, including vaccination.",
