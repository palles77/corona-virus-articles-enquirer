            "text": "The calcium pump SERCA2a (sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a), which plays a central role in cardiac contraction, shows decreased expression in heart failure (HF). Increasing SERCA2a expression in HF models improves cardiac function. We used direct cardiac delivery of adeno-associated virus encoding human SERCA2a (AAV6-hSERCA2a) in HF and normal canine models to study safety, efficacy, and the effects of immunosuppression. Tachycardic-paced dogs received left ventricle (LV) wall injection of AAV6-hSERCA2a or solvent. Pacing continued postinjection for 2 or 6 weeks, until euthanasia. Tissue/serum samples were analyzed for hSERCA2a expression (Western blot) and immune responses (histology and AAV6-neutralizing antibodies). Nonpaced dogs received AAV6-hSERCA2a and were analyzed at 12 weeks; a parallel cohort received AAV-hSERCA2a and immunosuppression. AAV-mediated cardiac expression of hSERCA2a peaked at 2 weeks and then declined (to *50%; p < 0.03, 6 vs. 2 weeks). LV end diastolic and end systolic diameters decreased in 6-week dogs treated with AAV6-hSERCA2a ( p < 0.05) whereas LV diameters increased in control dogs. Dogs receiving AAV6-hSERCA2a developed neutralizing antibodies (titer \u2021 1:120) and cardiac cellular infiltration. Immunosuppression dramatically reduced immune responses (reduced inflammation and neutralizing antibody titers < 1:20), and maintained hSERCA2a expression. Thus cardiac injection of AAV6-hSERCA2a promotes local hSERCA2a expression and improves cardiac function. However, the hSERCA2a protein level is reduced by host immune responses. Immunosuppression alleviates immune responses and sustains transgene expression, and may be an important adjuvant for clinical gene therapy trials.",

More than 400,000 new cases of heart failure are diagnosed each year, with more than 300,000 deaths attributed to the disease. Advances in pharmacological treatments including b-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists have decreased hospitalizations and improved survival in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of heart failure (Hunt et al., 2001) . In addition, device therapy using implantable cardioverterdefibrillators and biventricular pacemakers has decreased sudden death and improved pump function (Young et al., 2003) , and ventricular assist devices are available as a destination therapy (Nguyen and Thourani, 2010) . Heart failure is often progressive, however, and many patients eventually develop unremitting end-stage symptoms. The only definitive therapy available for these patients is cardiac transplantation. Unfortunately, limitations in donor supply and eligibility have relegated this therapy to a minority of patients. As the population ages and the incidence of heart failure rises, the need for novel therapeutics is clear.",

            "text": "Gene delivery using viral vectors is one potential therapeutic option. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been recognized as a promising vector for gene therapy applications because it is nonpathogenic, replication defective, able to infect nondividing cells (including cardiomyocytes), and capable of long-term transgene expression (Kaplitt et al., 1996; Xiao et al., 1996) . SERCA2a, the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a, loads calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and has been implicated in regulating the progression of dilated cardiomyopathy (Gianni et al., 2005) . In cardiac tissue isolated from patients and animals with heart failure, SERCA2a messenger RNA, protein, and activity levels decline (Bers et al., 2003; Braz et al., 2004; Del Monte et al., 2004) . Restoring SERCA2a levels using adenoviral vectors or adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors has been shown to improve function, metabolism, and/or survival in small and large animal models of heart failure (Hajjar et al., 1998; Del Monte et al., 2001; Kawase et al., 2008) . A phase 1/2 clinical trial (CUPID; Celladon, La Jolla, CA), testing the safety and efficacy of catheter-based cardiac delivery of AAV1-hSER-CA2a (Mydicar) in patients with advanced heart failure, has met its primary safety end points and suggested efficacy. Of note, more than 50% of potential subjects were excluded because of preexisting AAV1 neutralizing antibodies (Hajjar et al., 2008; Jaski et al., 2009; Jessup et al., 2011) .",

However, studies in clinical trials and large animal models, including our studies, which delivered AAV2-TNFRII-FC into baboon hearts (McTiernan et al., 2007) , have revealed a range of inflammatory immune responses to AAV vectors and their transgene products, which may reduce transgene expression (Herzog et al., 2001 (Herzog et al., , 2002 Wang et al., 2005 Wang et al., , 2007a Jiang et al., 2006; Manno et al., 2006; Mingozzi and High, 2007) and raise the risks associated with AAV-based gene delivery procedures. Identification of an effective immunosuppressive regimen for AAV gene delivery could potentially enhance efficacy and improve safety in AAV-mediated therapies. For example, it has been reported that immunosuppression can limit development of antibody directed to AAV-encoded factor IX (Herzog et al., 2001 (Herzog et al., , 2002 , and permit sustained AAVmediated minidystrophin expression in dog skeletal muscle (Herzog et al., 2001 (Herzog et al., , 2002 Wang et al., 2007b) .",

The subsequent clinical trial proposes such gene therapy delivery to occur at the time of ventricular assist device (VAD) placement in patients with end-stage heart failure. We observed that direct cardiac injection of AAV6-hSERCA2a into dog hearts promoted local robust hSERCA2a expression that was reduced by host immune responses.

In this report we used an AAV6-based vector encoding human SERCA2a, delivered by direct cardiac injection into nonfailing and failing dog hearts, and assessed (1) the effect of hSERCA2a expression on cardiac function in this heart failure model, (2) the persistence of hSERCA2a expression in the dog hearts, (3) the occurrence of immune responses, and (4) the effect of immunosuppression on hSERCA2a expression and immune responses. The major new observations of this study are as follows: (1) despite a limited area of injection, the AAV6-mediated overexpression of human SERCA2a was accompanied by improved measures of LV size and cardiac function in a large animal model of tachycardic-pacing induced heart failure; (2) CD4 + and CD8 + cellular infiltrates likely limit the duration and extent/ amount of the hSERCA2a expression; and (3) immunosuppression 4 weeks after vector delivery limited cellular infiltration (and anti-AAV humoral immune responses), and prolonged high-level hSERCA2a expression. This paper demonstrates AAV6-mediated expression of human SERCA2a in a large animal model of heart failure, with subsequent improvement in cardiac dimensions and systolic function. Although other AAV pseudotypes may show preferential organ tropism that varies between species (Yue et al., 2008) , AAV6 generates reasonably high cardiac and skeletal muscle expression in dogs (Bish et al., 2008) . Our approach included an antibody-based detection method to confirm overexpression of the AAV-encoded human SER-CA2a as opposed to enhanced expression of endogenous canine SERCA2a. The results generally follow prior reports in which targeted overexpression of SERCA2a can improve function of the failing mammalian heart. Cardiac SERCA2a overexpression by adenoviral vector in the rat aortic banding model improves survival and cardiac metabolism (Del Monte et al., 2001) . In addition, long-term overexpression of SERCA2a by AAV1 vector in a volume-overload porcine heart failure model reverses cardiac dysfunction (Kawase ",

The canine tachycardic-pacing model, believed to closely mimic many aspects of human nonischemic heart failure (Davidoff and Gwathmey, 1994) , has not been previously used as a large animal model of cardiac gene therapy. Although the delivery method (direct cardiac visualization and injection) is more invasive than may be envisioned for clinical trials, it permits high transduction in a localized identifiable area for subsequent analyses, minimizes collateral viral uptake in other organs, and could be used at the time of cardiac surgery in a clinical setting. An important observation was a cellular immune response to vector delivery (CD4 + and CD8 + cardiac infiltrates) that likely limited hSERCA2a expression encoded by the AAV6 vector. This occurred in both heart failure dogs, in which AAV was injected into the beating hearts, and in nonpaced dogs, which were injected while on cardiopulmonary bypass. These observations resemble our prior studies in baboon, in which cardiac infiltrations and overt myocarditis were observed to accompany a rapid rise and fall in the expression of an AAV2-encoded secreted gene product (TNFRII-Fc-IgG) after direct cardiac delivery of the AAV2based vector (McTiernan et al., 2007) . Such immune reactions could limit the effectiveness of gene delivery, and/or lead to progressively worsened cardiac function. The severity grade for fibrosis and chronic inflammation is described in Materials and Methods. The average severity score is from two high doseinjected sites within one heart and subsequently averaged between two dogs in each group (i.e., data from n = 2 per group). Fibrosis in the 6-week control was scored zero.

Infiltration and fibrosis occurred when using either ''research-grade'' heparin chromatography-purified vectors that contain substantial levels of empty capsids relative to full particles containing AAV DNA, or ''clinical trialgrade'' vectors prepared under GLP standards and purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation, which separates empty capsids from genome-containing vector particles. Not unexpectedly, we detected increased NAb titers to AAV6 after virus injection, which was higher in those dogs receiving ''research-grade'' versus ''clinical-grade'' preparations. Although we did not specifically assess the generation of a cellular anti-AAV response, this has been observed in prior studies in which dogs have received AAV vectors (Wang et al., 2007a (Wang et al., ,b, 2010 Ohshima et al., 2009) . However, we did not detect anti-human SERCA2a antibodies in dogs receiving AAV6-hSERCA2a, or cellular immune responses to SER-CA2a peptides containing human-specific/canine divergent amino acids, suggesting that the human SERCA2a protein did not elicit the immune responses.",

Comparative studies showed that direct injection of AAV induced infiltration in canine skeletal muscle whereas limb perfusion did not (Gregorevic et al., 2009; Ohshima et al., 2009) . Studies have also observed a vector particle dose-dependent immune response (Herzog et al., 2002) . Dogs may also present more severe immune responses to AAV or AAVencoded proteins than do other species (such as mice; Yuasa et al., 2007) , and strong cellular immune responses to skeletal muscle delivery of AAV have been noted in dogs (Wang et al., 2007a,b) .

Thus a large bolus of foreign antigen (i.e., AAV capsid) delivered by localized injection into striated muscle (such as the myocardium) could generate a depot for prolonged cellular immune response to AAV capsids retained at the injection site and presented for T cell recognition. This could contribute to the contrasting results in which catheter-based delivery of AAV vector encoding human SERCA2a to the myocardium does not elicit detectable cellular immune responses (Kaplitt et al., 1996; Kawase et al., 2008; Raake et al., 2008; Jaski et al., 2009) .",

A clinical trial using hepatic delivery (portal vein infusion) of AAV2 expressing factor IX (AAV2-hF.IX) observed a transient elevation and subsequent decrease in serum factor IX, accompanied by an increase (and eventual fall) in serum liver enzymes, suggesting cell-mediated destruction of liver cells loaded with AAV antigens (Manno et al., 2006) . Subsequent studies demonstrated the presence of CD8 + T cells reactive to AAV capsid epitopes (Mingozzi and High, 2007; and indicated that human hepatocytes containing even extremely low levels of MHC class I molecules loaded with AAV capsid-derived peptides are targets for cytotoxic T cell destruction (Pien et al., 2009) , suggesting that AAV capsid epitope presentation by MHC class I molecules is an important pathway for AAV-induced cytotoxic T cell responses. Anti-AAV T cell responses and antibody production, and progressively diminishing vector-encoded gene expression, occurred after intramuscular injection of patients with AAV1 encoding lipoprotein lipase-1 or a 1 -antitrypsin (AAT), although persistent low-level AAT expression was observed for months in some patients (Brantly et al., 2009) . The severity of immune responses to AAV encoding factor IX in hemophiliac dogs, and the duration of factor IX expression, depended at least in part on the route of AAV delivery and the development of anti-factor IX antibodies (Niemeyer et al., 2009) . Thus the immune response to AAVbased vectors remains a significant issue so as to maximize safety and efficacy of AAV-based gene delivery (Mingozzi and High, 2007) .",

Interestingly, there was no substantial change in AAV genome copy number regardless of the level of hSERCA2a expression or presence of immunosuppression (Fig. 3) . This may reflect, at least partially, the previously observed ''shutdown'' of viral promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, in virus-mediated gene delivery constructs, and may suggest a role for the inflammatory response in the process (L\u00f6 ser et al., 1998). We acknowledge several limitations to this study. Because of the difficulties in maintaining tachycardic-paced dogs for more than 6 weeks, cardiac functional and immune responses in heart failure animals were limited to that period, and thus we do not know how long improved cardiac function might be maintained. We assessed human SER-CA2a expression, immune responses, and the effect of immunosuppression at longer intervals after virus delivery to normal dogs. Whether immunosuppression of AAV6-hSER-CA2a-treated heart failure dogs would enhance cardiac function due to enhanced hSERCA2a expression remains to be determined. It is also not clear whether the immunological changes associated with heart failure may impact the immune response to AAV vectors. We did not directly confirm the cellular response to AAV capsid as a mechanism of cardiac infiltration and decay of hSERCA2a expression. However, (1) prior studies have documented activation of cytotoxic T cells in large animals (including canines) by AAV capsid-derived antigens, and (2) the high degree of conservation between human and canine SERCA2a ( > 99% amino acid residues) lessens the likelihood of canine immune responses to human SERCA2a. Indeed, no humoral response to hSERCA2a was detected, and the assayed human-specific hSERCA2a peptides did not elicit a detectable cellular response as indicated by interferon-c production. However, we cannot rule out reactivity below our level of detection, or a cellular response not revealed by IFN-c production.",

This may limit efficacy and raise safety issues, and may have implications for human SERCA2a trials. The humoral and cellular infiltrative immune responses elicited by the virus can be blunted by immunosuppressive therapy, and was associated with prolonged hSERCA2a expression. Such immunosuppressive therapies could prove to be a beneficial adjuvant to AAV-based interventions for human heart failure.",
