It is a branch of genetics, but is less focused on downstream products studied as proteomicsor correlation to specific heredity traits, as in clinical genetics. It uses Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) approaches to investigate how molecular structure, haplotype variation, and gene-environment complexity affect genotypes and phenotypes, and invokes other life science system studies and -omics. GWAS captures a population-wide picture of health, looking to locate patterns across multiple genes and many people. Thus, genomics refocuses from individual diagnostic and allied services, to initiatives for identifying opportunities to improve health and transform health-care across populations (Church, 2006) . Genomic medicine is quantitatively different from genetics, using variants as markers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prevention, as well as targets for treatment. These variants are segregated into non-Mendelian as well as Mendelian patterns, and integrated with the evidence base for gene-environment interactions. Public Health Genomics extends these studies into population-wide variations and their impact on evidence-based policy, health systems, and health delivery and resources. The concurrent sequencing technology developments and large-scale generation of population data uses informatics to collect, store, and analyze genetic combinations, patterns, and networks.",

A human genome can be sequenced (with errors) in about 24 hours for what is now less than US $5000. The goal is for genomic sequencing to be accessible for under US $1000, but for clinical purposes, this would have to be at an extremely low error rate, and be comprehensive of relevant variations among genes, exomes, and haplotypes. In terms of public health, the implications of genomics are substantial: extending pre-and neonatal screening to predispositions and susceptibilities in complex disorders; transforming health-care service organization and delivery through creation of vast amounts of data, simultaneously requiring complex systems for storage, access, and analytics; and creating new paradigms for population health care through prevention and treatment. Genomics is driving concurrent IT technologies, commercial and public biobanking initiatives, open access databases like the 1000 Genomes Project (see Relevant Websites listed at the end of the article), and commercial personalized medicine. All of these are contributing to the context of 'Big Data': data acquisition and use at a scale that allows new insights or creates new forms of value. The application of genomics to many areas of public health is expanding, such as the study of emerging infectious diseases and how they spread and evolve, to inform future pandemic planning.",

What followed was a dynamic period of public debate, scholarly work, policy making, and the enactment of national legislation, such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (2008) in the United States. The ELSI initiative soon became an applied bioethics approach, concerned with new developments in the diagnosis and treatment of human disease and possibilities for reproductive choice. It became characterized by its ethical, legal, and social scrutiny of the implications of emergent technologies, active outreach to constituencies involved in the development and use of them, and making these issues relevant to policy makers and accessible to publics. In particular, ELSI focused on the design and conduct of genomic research in respect to the production, analysis, and sharing of individual genomic information, the rapid advances in genomic technologies and the availability of increasing amounts of genomic information to affect health care, and the development of new paradigms and regulatory approaches in clinical medicine and public health.

In terms of public health genomics, organized efforts of social change have become allied to the positive reaction to environmental determinants of health, so that, in the sense that gene effects are often not deterministic, identification and functional characterization of concepts like risk and susceptibility are critical to predicting health outcomes. This has applications to pollution and toxicant exposure, population stratification (e.g., in respect to poverty, or drug use), and themes of wellness (healthy, or otherwise, lifestyles). The reemergence of genetic determinism (or essentialism), a feature of early genetics that explained all simple and complex behavior by way of genes, is less likely given acknowledgment of epigenetic and environmental effects known to occur throughout embryonic development and postnatal life. However, geneticization, \"an ongoing process by which differences between individuals are reduced to their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) codes\" (Lippman, 1991) , may become more persuasive in medical practice and the ways that genomics shapes medicine, society, and culture. How genomics is engaged with in society might lead to counterproductive ways in which not just diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, but also social and professional attitudes, are reflected in unpacking health determinants; especially with a concurrent shift from high penetrance tests to less that certain genomic contexts. For example, these kinds of prosaic attitudes may contribute to the increasing 'medicalization' of health, using the explanation of \"genome for .\" to focus on illness as the result of genomic fate (that is unavoidable) and choice (that is blameworthy). When applied across a population, some of these perhaps imperceptible medico-social changes may have significant implications for public health efforts, such as in health expenditure and allocation, poverty alleviation, or environmental activism. One of the key ethical challenges will be providing an appropriate balance between preventing untimely translation of nonvalidated or potentially harmful technologies and practices, and losing sight of the benefits of genomic technologies if appropriately used (Burke et al., 2010) .",

In these cases, the stresses (and challenges) that heredity and social bonds are uniformly subjected to are equally likely to offer an explanation of many shared social values, behavioral characteristics, or health traits. When misused and perpetuated, genomic characterizations merely keep alive prejudice or serve as an excuse to do nothing about existing social inequalities.",

Given quick, accurate, and relatively affordable sequencing becoming a reality, personalized medical data may be merged with public data systems for the purposes of public health planning (environmental and pathogen surveillance; disease response), and research alluding to population stratification in respect to medications. Many of the strategies to care just mentioned face logistic challenges in obtaining suitable genomic information in a timely enough fashion to guide diagnosis and prescriptions (including drug and lifestyle modification), and delivering it broadly enough to cover populations. Placing genomic information in an electronic medical record (covering all citizens) would facilitate this kind of personalized medicine. If the patient's entire genome were part of his or her medical record, then the complexities of acquiring a DNA sample, shipping it to a sequencing laboratory and waiting for the readout would be replaced by an electronic query. That data inquiry would still need clinical interpretation. However, the safeguards necessary to maintain the integrity of the model include challenges to access and control of the data medium or repository, the accuracy and long-term stability of the data, and clinical rigor in analysis and interpretation. It is likely that a number of ongoing debates about the application of clinical genetics will reemerge, such as the conceptual targets of screeningwhere there is a predisposition or risk of a traitto the application of direct tests for a haplo-or phenotype. Currently, clinical genetics is offered to patients who receive pre-and post-test genetic counseling. Clinical genomics would likely require a substantial infrastructure review to provide this coverage for populations, with access to not just offered to clinical staff, but also those utilizing commercial genomic sequencing. A large burden for interpreting these sequences would likely fall to primary physicians; expanding their repertoire from routine laboratory tests, to the real time scrutiny of a patients' electronic health and genomic records. A report by the UK Human Genomics Strategy Group included recommendations for improved genomics training for health-care professionals and changes to medical education to meet some of these future needs (Human Genomics Strategy Group, 2012).",

The Big Data concept concerns data of a large size, typically to the extent that its manipulation and management present significant logistical challenges, that signifies \". things one can do at a large scale that cannot be done at a smaller one, to extract new insights or create new forms of value\" (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Cukier, 2013). Big Data has become a key component in crime control, social engineering, and disease prediction (infectious disease emergence and spread). Genomics, therefore, is a version of Big Data in its perspective size and application; and, just like other sources of Big Data, it has become a driver of health information investment. Big Data has been associated with a culture of 'open access,' 'open consent,' and \u02bbinformation altruism.' The opportunity for collecting vast amounts of information about people embraces genomes and medical records as part of the vast networks of cameras and drones, personal tracking (e.g., face recognition software, transport cards, credit cards, and library cards), mapping of habits (purchases, holidays, and interests), and information analytics (such as internet use). This all-encompassing data creation is raising questions about the ownership and use of information generated by not just population-wide health systems, but also diverse intelligence gathering and logistics sources. For example, in the United Kingdom the government's care.data initiative proposed the sale to research institutions, pharmaceutical corporations, and others of data from all visits to National Health Service clinicians. While this is seen by some as a resource to benefit all by collating vast data and making it available for researchers to mine, a UK report observed that, although \"Business and government are united in their belief in the potential of 'Big Data' to drive economic growth, scientific innovation and service efficiency,\" there are a number of potentially less welcome implications for rights, such as privacy (Sciencewise, 2014).",

This is sometimes compounded by barriers to opting out of such commercial enterprises. On the one hand, it is presupposed that collective interests in economic, social, or public health benefits justifiably override the principles that protect individuals, often captured by consent and privacy norms. On the other hand, as well as it being a violation of rights or a betrayal of the doctor-patient relationship, it has been argued that such assumptions, especially when there are links to commercialization, can diminish public support (Critchley, 2008) . A recent special edition of Science lamented the end of privacy because, along with changing attitudes to making one's genetic sequences available to the public, it was experimentally confirmed that with some knowhow it is possible to identify persons in closed databases from open genealogy and internet searchers (Gymrek et al., 2013) . These are significant challenges to traditional research and clinical ethics. Big Data is enabled by emerging opportunities (genomics is but one of these), and the volunteers and unawares who provide the data (in this case, the participants of open data, and patients). This is creating novel questions of privacy, consent, participation, and the dynamics (and norms) of clinical relationships, within the networks of the Big Data collectors, users, and generators. This suggests that the more patient-specific information included in centralized databasescrucial to the long-term success of genomic medicinethe harder it will be to ensure patients' anonymity.",

It was claimed that some genotypes, such as BRCA-predisposed breast cancer, could be inferred across the population. In an editorial that accompanied a Nature special edition on the 'Genomes of Icelanders,' it was stated that the results could provide a strategy for the analysis of the genetic variation in any population and raises questions about how society should implement the knowledge gained (see Relevant Websites, at the end of the article). The deCODE example is contentious in this regard because, although it collected full DNA sequences from just a few thousand volunteers, it is possible to extrapolate genotypic features of all the other Icelanders, including those who never volunteered. This has been presented as a public health interest, because it is possible to detect these mutations in the volunteer population and infer the status of the rest of the population. So, for example, if information about the status of breast cancer e.g., (BRCA) genes is already known, it is now a question as to whether everyone affected should be told. The idea is that nonvolunteers might be compelled to know their status.",

In one paper, it was concluded that patents were claimed on 21-41% of human genes based on long (over 150 nucleotide) fragments, whereas for short fragments nonspecificity meant that 100% of human genes had some portion patented (Rosenfeld and Mason, 2013) . At the outset of the HGP, it was proposed that the DNA sequence generated should be freely available to the public. This principle was codified in the 1997 Bermuda Principles that called for rapid sharing without restrictions on use. However, isolated genomic sequences are still patentable in many jurisdictions often as long as the patent meets certain conditions. Patents are based on the outlay of research and the costs of bringing an invention to market. They are awarded based on general principles of novelty, technical progress, and creative effort (the inventive step), influence of prior patent applications on validity, and scope of description and claims. The interpretation of these principles will differ between jurisdictions. However, with respect to DNA, it is likely that the cost of identifying the function of gene is a fraction of the cost of turning that into something useful. Making genomic data freely accessible would therefore allow researchers to focus on patenting the innovations that come from them. Nevertheless, gene patents have become central to many genomics companies' strategies. On 13 June 2013, the US Supreme Court in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. held that a naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated (a similar judgment was subsequently made in Australia in 2015). However, the US court did find that cDNA, synthetic DNA molecules that contain only exons, do involve an inventive step and thus remain patent eligible. It is not clear how the decision will affect the claims on other sequences and whether they are still valid. Before the Myriad decision, there were substantial concerns that in order to offer whole genome sequencing, clinical laboratories would have to pay royalties to a long list of gene patent holders.",

The technology is derived from the CRISPR system found in bacteria that, among other functions, is used to defend against viruses. The Cas enzyme neutralizes foreign DNA by snipping, and uses a CRISPR DNA sequence to know what and where to snip. CRISPR is like a personal reference collection for acquired resistance to viruses, which is added to each time the organism is infected. Utilizing the system allows researchers to precisely cut DNA at any location on the genome, enabling precise control gene expression by deleting and adding sequences. This can be coupled with systems to read the genetic code, and mechanisms to write synthetic functional code. It can be used to replace or augment genetically diseased tissues, and to insert new material to alter an organism's function in situ. Uses so far include creating models of human disease in animals; or to introduce environmental tolerance, improve crop yield, and create resistance to pathogens in plants. It may be adapted to synthetic biology to allow natural organisms to be reprogrammed to have novel, useful functions such as making plastic, to treat wastewater, generate electricity, manufacture fuel, and fabricate new drugs. In addition to the basic science it enables, it might be used to target blood circulating parasites, viruses, or cancer genomes, for example.

CRISPR can also alter expression of multiple genes simultaneously, thus potentially offering an approach to more complex disorders. The study of genomes potentially leads to the dual use of such technologies, for example, to sequence the influenza virus and potentially introduce further threatening characteristics.

Genomic studies will allude to the complexities of ecosystem interactions between all components of the biosphere. Increasingly, genomics will engage transdisciplinary studies, involving experts in clinical, epidemiological, anthropological, ecological, and veterinary fields, to identify risks and solutions. Many hosts are unaffected by pathogens that they harbor, and these pathogens often affect closely related species, such as human beings and Great Apes. Many endemic pathogens, such as HIV, originate in primates, and those such as Influenza and Coronaviruses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, have animal reservoirs and hosts. Genomic studies promise approaches to pandemic planning and response, such as mapping origins and susceptibilities thought the ecology.",

For example, comprehensive analysis of the genome sequence of individual cancers has helped uncover the specific mutations that contribute to the malignant phenotype, identifing new targets for therapy, and increasing the opportunities for choosing the optimal treatment for each patient. The impact of cancer genomics across populations would be substantial. At present, it is likely that the infrastructure is not in place to support both the patient and the physicians who encounter the resultant data. Moreover, even the most promising technologies cannot fully realize their potential if the relevant policy, legal, and regulatory issues are not adequately addressed.",
