During these investigations, both p-cationic cyclization of chiral N-thienylmethyl-6-oxopipecolinic acids into pure (S)keto-lactams and theirs regioselective and diastereoselective reduction, considered as key steps of this sequence, were studied. Of particular interest, the FriedeleCrafts cyclization using (CF 3 CO) 2 O/BF 3 $Et 2 O show that near the expected keto-lactams, enamides and enamidones containing trifluoromethyl residue were isolated.

            "text": "2,3-Fused quinolizidine framework is an important motif which is found in numerous compounds among which the scarce phenanthroquinolizidines extract from three plants families. 1 The small family of pentacyclic alkaloids (Scheme 1), is represented by the bioactive (\u00c0)-Cryptopleurine (R\u00bcH, 1), 1a (\u00c0)-(15R)-Hydroxycryptopleurine (R\u00bcOH, 2) , 1a,b Cryptopleuridine (3), 1c Boehmeriasin-A (R\u00bcOMe, 4), 1d and Boehmeriasin-B (R\u00bcOH, 5) . 1d Based on the success of similar alkaloids with simpler skeleton, the phenanthroindolizidines, most of which demonstrate remarkable biological and pharmacological profiles, anticancer notably. In the light of these results, numerous efforts were undertaken to carry out quantitative structureeactivity relationship (QSAR) studies (Scheme 1). The results of certain phenanthroquinolizidine derivatives show inhibitory activity in three human cancer cell lines with appreciable IC 50 (104e130 nM), 2 the potential to treat coronavirus infection, 3 good to excellent in vivo antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 4 and anti-proliferative and selective antitumor properties. 5 While these studies were based essentially on Cryptopleurine (1) as the alkaloid model, the more recent Boehmeriasin-A (4) based compounds have shown in in vitro study anti-proliferative activity in three cancer cell lines (CEM, HeLa, and L1210) and in two endothelial cell lines (HMEC-1, BAEC) at concentration near the nanomolar range. Interestingly, during these studies, topoisomerases and SIRT2 were identified to be biological targets of these structures. 6 Out of such considerations, the synthesis of these natural products and derivatives has been an appealing area of research. Most of the hitherto reported approaches into these types of compounds rely on a small number of strategies; the majority of which centers on the construction of the aza-six-membered ring E from cheap educts, which used subsequently as a chiral pool and a nitrogen atom source (Scheme 1). The ring closure of the central ring D proceeded then by FriedeleCrafts cyclization as pioneered by Rapoport et al., 6, 7 the Parham-type cycloacylation 8 and intramolecular aldol-type condensation. 6, 9 Beyond other racemic experimental protocols 10 an alternative and interesting approach based on the construction first of chiral polycyclic systems containing piperidine-2-methanol (AeD) was also developed. 11 These key intermediates, when involved in a ring-closing metathesis afford a way to vary the nature and the size of the cycle at the end of the targets enchainment E and are used to produce the molecular diversity. 5 Curiously, no QSAR studies based on the modulation at the aromatic phenanthrene residue of these alkaloids have been described to this day. Along this line of reasoning, small aromatic analogues of these described phenanthroquinolizidines have been used as intermediates in the synthesis of the potent anticancer Saframycin-A (6) 7b and precursors of enantiopure and nonproteogenic aromatic-d-amino acids (7). 12 Other structures, exemplified by compounds 8 and 9 were also found procreative. Their preparation is based on an imine Michael reaction followed by a radical cyclization 13 and intramolecular Schmidt reaction of acyl chlorides with alkyl azides, the last proceeding via N-acyliminium species as intermediates. 14 In keeping with our longstanding interest in the synthesis of indolizidinones and quinolizidinones fused to sulfur heterocyclic systems, 15 and their use for the elaboration of alkyl(or aryl) bicyclic iminosugars and their salts, 16 we herein report our findings on synthesis and properties of chiral thienoquinolizidindiones starting from chiral 6-oxopiperidine-carboxylic acid (6-oxopipecolinic acid) . Their sequential stereoselective reduction led to the targeted thieno analogues of the bioactive phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 10 (R\u00bcOH) and 11 (R\u00bcH) (Scheme 1).",

During these investigations, we envisaged both p-cationic cyclization of chiral N-thienylmethyl-6-oxopipecolinic acids into pure (S)-keto-lactams and their regioselective and diastereoselective reduction. The latter reductions, considered as key steps of this sequence, were investigated in order to get some insights necessary for further applications in the syntheses of these types of compounds. The overall yield of these transformations of approximately 19% in the series a and 27% in the series b outlines the higher reactivity at the C 2 -position of the thiophene ring (series a) compared to its C 3 -position (series b) during the important cyclization step.",

On the other hand, the approach using the combination of (CF 3 CO) 2 O/BF 3 $Et 2 O is also very interesting since apart from expected keto-lactams, enamides and enamidones containing trifluoromethyl residue were isolated. A mechanism leading to the latter products, which have high synthetic potential, was discussed.",

Thienoquinolizidinols cis-10Ba,b and trans-10Ba,b were reached by lactamic carbonyl reduction in tandem with the acetate deprotection, but their transformation into the targeted epi-thienoquinolizidine analogues (S)-11Ba,b using various reducing agents failed in all attempts. However, this operation could be conducted efficaciously starting from alcohol-lactams cis-10Aa,b and trans-10Aa,b by first reducing the alcohol into enantiopure tricyclic lactams (S)-11Aa,b followed by their reduction at the lactamic ketone.",

Chemical shifts (d) are quoted in ppm and are referenced to the tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. The qCOSY, NOESY and DIFFNOE techniques were used in assignment of 1 He 1 H relationships and the determination of relative configuration. The qHSQC and qHMBC techniques were used throughout for the assignment of the 1 He 13 C relationships. The elemental analyses were carried out by the microanalysis laboratory of INSA, F-76130 Mt.
