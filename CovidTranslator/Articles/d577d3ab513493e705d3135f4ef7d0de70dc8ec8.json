Most hospitals do not routinely test for CoV resulting in gaps in our clinical and epidemiologic understanding of this virus. The predictors of severe infection are well known for CoV associated with acute respiratory syndromes (eg. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV), yet few studies have identified these predictors for the more common four circulating CoV strains such as OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63 12, 13 . The primary objective of this study was to describe the burden of CoV among patients admitted to an acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada over a six-year period, and identify the predictors of severe disease.",

Independent variables included coronavirus strain (OC43 vs. non-OC43), gender, smoking status (not a smoker, previously a smoker, current smoker), and age. The age variable was converted into a categorical variable with three categories including: less than 60 years of age, patients between 61 and 80 years of age, and patients over 80 years of age. The Chi-squared/Fisher's exact test, Kruskal Wallis, Mann-Whitney and unpaired T-tests were used to assess the presence of statistically significant correlations between dependent and independent variables. Statistically significant correlations were included in univariable logistic or non-parametric regression analyses to evaluate the predictive ability of the independent variable. A bivariate and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were also performed including the following variables: age, smoking status (current or previous smoker vs. nonsmoker), viral strain (OC43 vs. non-OC43), nosocomial vs. community acquired infection, gender, and number of comorbidities (3 or more vs. less than 3).

Garbino and colleagues found that 31% of patients in their cohort were admitted to the ICU, and noted an all-cause mortality of 10%. Lowerrespiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are the fourth leading cause of mortality globally, and characterizing the epidemiology of respiratory viruses is a necessary first step to reducing the burden of disease 7 .",

Importantly, our study did not include asymptomatic or subclinical cases or non-CoV controls, which makes it challenging to identify determinants of severity relative to these other populations. Moreover, as data emerges on the association of CoVs with central nervous system sequalae, future studies should investigate the incidence of strokes, and seizures in cases of CoV infection 30 . The number of patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should also be considered in subsequent studies. Since our assay was not quantitative we are unable to determine the role of viral load in influencing disease severity, although it has been noted by others that viral load did not correlate with outcome 31 . Furthermore, we did not include biomarkers associated with liver function. It has been reported that elevated ALT was associated with adverse outcomes in patients infected with SARS 32 , and further investigation is necessary to determine the prognostic value in other CoV infections. Finally, the relatively small numbers of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cases of each strain (e.g. OC43, 229E, HKU1, NL63) prevented separate analysis of any potential effects of individual strains on patient outcome.",

However, this is an area where additional studies are needed.Our study has several important limitations.
