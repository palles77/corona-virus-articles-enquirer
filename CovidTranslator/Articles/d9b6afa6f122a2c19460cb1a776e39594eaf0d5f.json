In this manuscript, each community is modeled as a multiplex network (i.e., virtual layer and physical one). The connections inside certain community are referred as inter-contacts while the intra-contacts denote the connections among communities. For the epidemic spreading process, the traditional susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is adopted. Then, corresponding state transition trees are determined and simulations are conducted to study the epidemic spreading process in multicommunities. Here, the effect of incorporating virtual layer on the range of individual affected by the epidemic is pursued. As illustrated, multi-summits are incurred if the spreading in multi-communities is considered; furthermore, the disparity between summits varies. This is affected by various factors. As indicated, the incorporation of virtual layer is capable of reducing the proportion of individuals being affected; moreover, disparity of different summits is likely to be increased regarding with scenarios of excluding virtual layer. Furthermore, the summit is likely to be postponed if virtual layer is incorporated.",

Nevertheless, in practice, a network is usually classified into several communities while a community is composed of a group of nodes in the network while the community is more densely connected than with the other nodes of the network. For instance, the Worldwide Airport Network is composed of Airport Network of US, Airport Network of India, Airport Network of China and so forth. Moreover, community detection methods are presented and standards are proposed in order to measure the community partition [2] [3] [4] . This indicates most networks are not isolated but interacting with each other, being referred to as a network of networks (NoN). Within each individual network, the connectivity links are maintained to represent various connections (often called intercontacts ); whereas links are added to connect each network to others (being referred to as intra-contacts ) [5] . This type of networks is capable of modeling a number of real-world systems, for instance, the European air transport system [6] , the global cargo ship network [7] , living organisms [8] [9] [10] and social networks [11, 12] .",

In [16, 17] , a two-layered multiplex network is presented in order to analyze the epidemic spreading process, while the application of this two-layered network model is also thoroughly investigated [18, 19] . In this model, the two layers are referred to as a virtual layer and a physical one respectively. The physical layer is composed of individuals while the links represent the corresponding practical body contacts. For the virtual layer, it is consisting of virtual nodes (with each node corresponding to an individual on the physical layer); here, the connections indicate relationships incurred by various social ties, such as phone call, twitter, Wechat and etc. On the virtual layer, the information about the epidemic is spreading among nodes; whereas on the physical layer, biological elements carrying the virus of epidemic are exchanged among individuals through physical contacts.",

Nevertheless, the summits of the epidemic spreading process in multicommunities are likely to occur at different time. As indicated by previous studies, the disparity of different summits is likely to be affected by a number of factors, such as infectivity probabilities, recovery probability, network topology and etc. Nevertheless, it is still of great interest to investigate the problem of minimizing the range of individuals being affected by the epidemic. Hence, in this manuscript, the evolution process is further investigated which is spreading in two intra-connected communities. Here, the adopted model to mimic the spreading process is the traditional SIR model. Furthermore, each community is characterized by a two-layered multiplex model. Thus, the effect of incorporating virtual layer on the epidemic spreading process is pursued with the analysis of illustrative examples.",

For comparison, the scenario of excluding the virtual layer is also investigated. As per by the simulation results, the incorporation of virtual layer is capable of reducing the proportion of infected individuals to a large extent. This phenomena is consistent with common sense as once an individual is aware of the epidemic, various preventive measures are taken to reduce the infectivity. For the investigated system with provided parameters in Table 2 , there are two summits occurred, being referred to as M curve. For different experiment, the summits are likely to come at different time step. This is due to the different nodes being selected for initial infection and the stochastic fluctuations of simulation based approaches. Furthermore, disparity of the summits of the epidemic spreading process in different communities is also presented in Table 3 for different experiments. Here, five simulations are conducted and presented for simplicity. As shown by the obtained time step of the summits, we can see the summit for communities without the virtual layer always comes later than that for the scenario with virtual layer. This indicates that the incorporation of virtual layer is able to postpone the summit of the epidemic spreading process. Furthermore, as indicated by the results, for the scenario with virtual layer, the average value of disparity is obtained as 37.4; nevertheless, if the virtual layer is not incorporated, the corresponding average value is obtained as 20. This shows the disparity between two summits is likely to be enlarged if the virtual layer is investigated.",

The obtained results are presented in Fig. 9 ; here, the parameters remain as in Table 2 . As per by the results in Fig. 9 , we can draw the conclusion that the system topology plays an important role in affecting the epidemic spreading process in multicommunities. If the effects of other factors are focused, similar analysis can be performed. Moreover, the nodes on different virtual layers for different communities might be also intra-connected; this is consistent with practice, for instance, two individuals from different countries might only be friends through internet tools such as twitter. If the intra-connections are incorporated, then similar analysis can be performed with minor modification of the probability transition tree.

In this manuscript, the SIR model is adopted to describe the infectious process. If virtual layer is incorporated, then corresponding state transition tree is derived. Then, MC simulation is performed to investigate the epidemic spreading process. As indicated, the incorporation of virtual layer is capable of reducing the proportion of infected individuals to a large extent. This is consistent with common sense as individuals are more likely to take protective measures if they already know the epidemic. Furthermore, the occurrence of the maximum value of the transition process in certain community can be postponed if the virtual layer is considered. Moreover, the difference between the summits of different trends is able to be reduced greatly by incorporating the virtual layer.",
