            "text": "Many viruses have been recovered from or associated with calf pneumonia outbreaks, and the list is likely to lengthen in the future. Concurrent infection with two or more viruses is frequently demonstrable in the same outbreak. 8 \u2022 64 Viral activity has been reported most frequently in the early stages of outbreaks of acute pneumonia, and it would appear in many cases that primary virus infection initiates the outbreak, producing respiratory tract damage that is subsequently extended by mycoplasmas and secondary bacterial infection. Whether viral activity occurs in every outbreak of calf pneumonia is unknown, but undoubtedly in the past many infections have not been detected because of improper timing of sampling and submission of unsuitable or inadequate specimens to the diagnostic laboratory. In one survey of 38 outbreaks of calf pneumonia investigated at an early stage, viral activity was demonstrable in 27 (70 per cent). &-a The viruses that have been most frequently recovered from outbreaks of calf pneumonia are parainfluenza-3 virus (PI-3 virus), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and bovine virus diarrhea/mucosal disease virus (BVD/MD virus). These agents are widely distributed in the cattle population of most countries, and serologic surveys in various American states have revealed a high prevalence of antibody to them. 40 \u2022 65 In a 3-year longitudinal study of respiratory viral infection on a large calf-rearing unit, although a number of different viral infections, including reovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and adenovirus, were identified, only PI-3 virus and RSV infections were shown by statistical analysis to be significantly associated with outbreaks of respiratory disease. 49 Calf challenge experiments have shown that strains of both PI -3 virus and RSV can produce extensive pulmonary consolidation when inoculated into calves, with the most severe lesions being produced in seronegative calves less than 6 months old (Fig. 1) . 9 \u2022 11 \u2022 37 Following experimental infection, PI-3 and RSV replicate in epithelial cells of both the upper and lower respiratory tract, and virus may be present in nasal secretions for up to 20 days following infection. Replication of virus in epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract causes bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and alveolitis of varying severity. In the acute stage of virus infection, there is proliferation and necrosis of bronchiolar epithelial cells with widespread destruction of cilia and of ciliated cells in small bronchi and bronchioli. 10 Hyperplasia of alveolar epithelial cells may be extensive, and epithelial syncytia are often formed on bronchiolar and alveolar walls. Both viruses infect alveolar macrophages, and viral interference with alveolar macrophage function may be a major predisposing factor to secondary bacterial pneumonia. 57 \u2022 58 In the repair stages of severe PI-3 virus or RSV pneu-monia, there is widespread organization of bronchiolar exudate, leading to the formation of residual fibrous masses within bronchiolar lumina. B-n The clinical picture seen in many experimental and naturally occurring PI -3 or RSV infections is of only mild or moderate severity. However, severe outbreaks of pneumonia associated with RSV or a combination of RSV and PI -3 virus infection also occur. These are seen most commonly in the fall, and calves from 1 month old to yearlings may be affected; in an affected group, up to 20 per cent of calves may rapidly develop severe respiratory distress. The pathologic and microbiologic findings in the lower respiratory tract of these severely affected animals are indicative of an extensive virus pneumonia. 8 \u2022 39 BVD/MD virus is not uncommonly detected in the nasal secretions and lungs of calves with pneumonia, and development of antibodies to this virus may occur in association with outbreaks of calf pneumonia. Mild clinical signs of respiratory disease and small scattered areas of interstitial pneumonia have been observed following endobronchial inoculation of calves with BVD/ MD virus. 41 Numerous bacteria were present in the lower respiratory tract of some of these experimental animals, indicating that BVD virus infection impaired bacterial clearance. A severe respiratory illness with extensive fibrinopurulent pneumonia developed in calves sequentially inoculated with BVD/MD virus and, 5 days later, with Pasteurella haemolytica. 41 Such studies on the pathogenesis of BVD/MD virus infection of the bovine respiratory tract have been all too rare, and further experimental work is necessary to clarify the role of this virus in outbreaks of calf pneumonia.",

In most experimental infections, lung lesions produced by mycoplasmas have been very limited in extent, and clinical signs have been mild and frequently absent. Therefore, doubt has been expressed as to whether mycoplasmas alone, in the absence of viral and secondary bacterial infections, can produce lung lesions of e,omparable severity to those seen in naturally occurring outbreaks. Synergism has been demonstrated between M. bovisand P. haemolytica in calf pneumonia, but the mechanism of the synergistic effect is not understood. 21 Future studies must consider virus/ mycoplasma and mycoplasma/bacteria interaction in the bovine lung if the pathogenesis of calf pneumonia is to be fully understood.",

In these circumstances, the source of infection is harder to comprehend, and several factors appear to be important: 1 . A proportion of calves may be infected with respiratory pathogens at a very early stage in life. PI -3 virus and RSV excretion has been detected in colostrum-fed calves only a few days of age and in a small proportion of colostrum-deprived calves removed from farms at birth and raised under isolation conditions. 5 Such excretion is usually associated with mild signs of respiratory disease that may well be missed under field conditions. PI-3 virus has on occasion been isolated from aborted bovine fetuses, 44 and antibody to PI -3 virus and to RSV has been detected in bovine fetal fluids. 15 \u00b7 17 Naturally occurring pneumonia has been observed in bovine fetal lungs and in the lungs of unsuckled calves only a few hours old, and histologic lesions suggestive of paramyxovirus disease have been described. 4 \u00b7 36 Udder infection, with excretion of virus in milk, has been described in naturally occurring Pl-3 virus infections of cows, and the strains involved produced respiratory disease when inoculated into calves. 27 These observations indicate that congenital or very early neonatal infection with respiratory viruses can occur. Genital and udder infection of the dam may also occasionally be a source of early M. bovis, ureaplasma, or M. bovigenitalium infection for the young calf. A proportion of calves, therefore, may already be infected with respiratory pathogens before being incorporated into a self-contained group and can subsequently disseminate infection to their comrades. 2. Outbreaks of pneumonia may occur when the same group of animals has been together for weeks or months with no history of previous illness, with no changes in management or introduction of new stock, and sometimes under experimental isolation conditions. Such incidents may be triggered by activation of persistent or latent virus infection within the respiratory tract. The factors influencing activation in the natural situation are not fully understood, but factors such as waning of maternal antibodies, the stress of sudden temperature swings, changes in weather conditions, or decreased dietary protein intake after weaning leading to reduced pro-duction of interferon within the respiratory tract have all been suggested. 25 \u00b7 55 3.

Therefore, treatment is based on antibiotic therapy directed against the mycoplasmal and bacterial components of the disease. Good in-vitro activity against M. dispar and bovine respiratory tract ureaplasmas has been demonstrated for the antibiotics tiamulin hydrogen fumarate and tylosin tartrate. 2 In severe outbreaks, it is best to treat the entire group with antibiotics administered by parenteral routes using a regimen that maintains therapeutic levels in the lung for at least 3 to 4 days. In the experience of the author, a combination of intramuscular tylosin tartrate administered at a dose rate of 10 mg per kg daily for 3 to 4 days with another broad-spectrum antibiotic such as oxytetracycline to provide additional activity against Pasteurella sp. has often produced satisfactory results. This is particularly true when the first dose of oxytetracycline has been administered intravenously at a rate of 20 mg per kg. Encouraging results have also been reported following the use of a combination of lincomycin and spectinomycin (50 mg lincomycin and 100 mg spectinomycin per ml) administered by intramuscular injection for 3 to 5 days at a rate of 15 mg per kg (1 ml per 10 kg). 51 Antibiotic therapy is most likely to be effective when applied in the early stages of outbreaks, or to treat acute bacterial exacerbations of respiratory qisease. Where viruses are not playing a major role in the production of lung damage, a satisfactory clinical response may occur over a period of 24 to 72 hours. In cases of severe viral pneumonia or cases of chronic pneumonia in which fibrous broncho-occlusive lesions or lymphoid \"cuffing\" lesions are well established, antibiotic therapy will have a lesser impact. Response to antibiotic therapy may also be disappointing in cases in which M. bovis is involved. 47 Severely affected animals that fail to respond to antibiotic therapy alone are commonly treated with anti-inflammatory agents. A popular method of anti-inflammatory therapy involves the administration of one or more doses of corticosteroids (for example, one or two intravenous injections of dexamethasone at a dose rate of 20 to 40 mg per 50 kg). 33 Corticosteroids may, on occasion, cause exacerbations of viral respiratory tract disease. A recent report has indicated the potential value of an alternative form of anti-inflammatory therapy using the antiprostaglandin compound flunixin meglumine. When this drug was given intravenously at a dose rate of 2. 2 mg per kg for 3 consecutive days, it markedly reduced the severity of clinical signs and extent of pulmonary consolidation in experimental PI-3 virus pneumonia of calves. 46 Bronchodilators such as clenbuterol or etemiphylline and mucolytics such as bromhexine hydrochloride are also available for the treatment of calf pneumonia. When bromhexine hydrochloride is administered simultaneously with oxytetracycline, the levels of the latter in bronchial mucus are considerably increased. Unfortunately, little detailed clinical information has been published with which to assess the efficacy of bronchodilator or mucolytic therapy.",

To overcome the problem of colostral antibody interference in young calves, it may be necessary to develop live intranasal or inactivated RSV vaccines. The preliminary results mentioned previously for an inactivated RSV vaccine based on glutaraldehyde-fixed cells are particularly encouraging. Further trials are necessary, however, and this vaccine is not yet commercially available. Future epidemiologic and pathogenetic studies may reveal that it is necessary to increase the spectrum of virus vaccines in the prophylaxis of calf pneumonia to include such agents as BVD virus, adenoviruses, or some of the more recently recognized respiratory virus infections, such as calf coronavirus.",
