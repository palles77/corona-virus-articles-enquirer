Thus, a specific and sensitive diagnostic test is essential for the management of H7 subtype influenza infections. In this study, five mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) were produced and characterized by the Western blot, immunofluorescence, and hemagglutination inhibition assays. All five specific mAbs reacted with the HA protein of H7N9 but not with that of H1N1, H3N2, or H5N1. With the combination arrays of capture and detection antibodies, the matched pair mAbs (1C4-coated and 2D7-labeled) were selected and employed in a double-antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA). Detection limits of the sandwich ELISA were 0.45 ng mL -1 for the HA protein derived from A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9); or 1 and 2 HA units/50 \u00b5L for A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and A/GD/17SF003/2016 (H7N9), respectively. These anti-HA mAbs against subtype H7 and the novel DAS-ELISA provide a valuable approach for specific detection of the H7 subtype influenza virus and quantification of its HA protein, especially for the novel epidemic H7N9. influenza A, H7 subtype, hemagglutinin, monoclonal antibodies, sandwich ELISA Tan, W.

            "text": "A novel reassortant avian influenza H7N9 virus infecting humans was first reported in March 2013 (Gao et al., 2013) . As of June 17, 2018, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has reported 1,625 human cases with 623 deaths (http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/ empres/H7N9/situation_update.html). Although no sustained transmission was observed within humans, the influenza A (H7N9) virus has caused five epidemics and has evolved and clustered into two diversified lineages based on the hemagglutinin (HA) genes: the Yangtze River Delta lineage and the Pearl River Delta lineage Qi et al, 2018) . Notably, before 2016, the low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7N9 was circulated with little disease in the infected poultry; however, it could cause severe infections in humans. With the evolution of these viruses, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N9, in which multiple basic amino acids (aa) are inserted into the cleavage site of the HA protein, reportedly infected humans in the fifth epidemic (2016-2017) . The HPAI H7N9 viruses were also detected in poultry markets and caused several severe disease outbreaks in chicken farms (http:// www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=23367). As of November 7, 2018, the HPAI H7N9 viruses have been reported in birds or environments in at least 14 provinces, municipalities, or autonomous regions in China (http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/ empres/H7N9/situation_update.html). Importantly, the H7N9 virus could acquire additional mutations during their replication in ferrets or humans and could become highly lethal in mammals and transmissible in ferrets by respiratory droplet Shi et al., 2017; Qi et al, 2018; Shi et al., 2018 ). An extended geographic spread of the virus was also observed in poultry markets and farms in early 2017 (Quan et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2018) . The H7N9 viruses currently co-circulate with influenza H1N1 and H3N2 and are reassorted with other unknown influenza viruses Shi et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2018) , exhibiting an increased replicative ability and medium-to-high pathogenicity in ducks Zeng et al., 2018) . Thus, the circulation of H7 subtype avian influenza poses a potential pandemic threat for both poultry and humans.",

By contrast, the antigen detection methods based on enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have repeatedly shown their value in the diagnosis of influenza infection (Koski and Klepser, 2017) . Double-antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA) with matched antibody pairs is typically more sensitive than direct or indirect ELISA.

Indirect ELISA using rHA coating was performed to determine the IgG antibody titer against HA. A, Immunized BALB/c mouse serum was collected, and the HA-specific IgG titer against A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) HA was tested by indirect ELISA. The average end-point IgG titer was measured as 1:51,200 in mouse serum. B, HA-specific IgG titer in the murine ascetic fluid. Five hybridoma cell lines with the strongest binding to A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) HA, namely 1C4, 2B3, 2D7, 3E4, and 3E5, were selected. The mAbs were then generated by inoculating the selected hybridoma cells into the BALB/c mice, with an average H7 subtype-specific IgG titer of more than 1:512,000 in the ascetic fluid.",

In this study, the HA derived from novel H7 subtype influenza (A/Anhui/1/2013, H7N9) was used as immunogen for the mAb development. All five mAbs specifically reacted with the HA derived from novel H7 subtype influenza but not with those of other subtypes influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, or H5N1) in Western blot and immunofluorescence assays, indicating that these mAbs are specific to the H7 subtype influenza virus. In addition, our data indicate that all five mAbs are IgG1 isotype, specifically recognized as linear epitopes on the HA antigen in Western blot assay. However, only mAb 1C4 possessed HI activity, indicating that 1C4 (as the captured Ab in the DAS-ELISA) recognized different antigenic epitopes from 2D7 (as the detection Ab) on HA of H7 subtype influenza virus. Although our data indicated that all the five mAbs recognized the HA aa at a range of 200-335 aa (Figure 3) , a panel of Cterminal nested deletions or overlapping peptides should be generated to refine the exact epitopes of individual mAb in the future.",

The results demonstrated that only the H7 subtype influenza virus strains tested positive in the study, whereas all other influenza subtypes and respiratory tract pathogens were tested negative with A 450 value below 0.1 or the cut-off value (data not shown). The optimized pairing of mAbs showed a good performance for the detection of HA antigens of epidemic H7N9 viruses, including the LPAI A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and the HPAI A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (H7N9). To our knowledge, the continuous evolution of H7N9 viruses has diversified into two lineages: the Yangtze River Delta lineage and the Pearl River Delta lineage. As A/ Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) is a representative of the Yangtze River Delta lineage, and the A/GD/17SF003/2016 (H7N9) is a representative of highly pathogenic H7N9 variant reported in the Pearl River Delta region in Guangdong province, our data demonstrated the good performance of the established DAS-ELISA for the detection of both lineages of H7N9 viruses in this study, indicating that the proposed detection method is applicable for the circulating H7N9 viruses. The alignments and analysis results of the HA aa sequences from five representative H7 strains, such as A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), A/Shanghai/1/2013(H7N9), A/GD/17SF003/2016 (H7N9), A/duck/Fujian/SD208/2017(H7N9), and A/duck/ Fujian/SE0195/2018(H7N2), yielded similarity ratios ranging from 95.7% to 98.6% ( Figure 6 ). Considering the specific regions recognized by the five mAbs at 200-335 aa, the established DAS-ELISA demonstrated the potential application for further usage for the H7 variants detection. Additionally, although the mAb-based DAS-ELISA owned the advantages of high specificity and the unlimited supply of a standardized reagent, further studies should be conducted to confirm if this method could be applied for more variants of H7 strains, such as the recombinant H7N2 strain which appeared in a poultry in Fujian province .",

The anti-HA mAb-based DAS-ELISA may also provide an alternative assay for influenza vaccine potency; it requires strain-specific mAbs and optimized pairing of antibodies. The WHO released two recommendations for influenza A (H7N9) candidate vaccine viruses since 2013. Initially, the organization recommended using the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) or A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) for a candidate vaccine virus in 2013 and then updated their report to A/ Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (H7N9) or A/Hunan/02650/2016 (H7N9) in 2017. A capture ELISA with mAbs against H7 HA was recently developed to quantify the HA of inactivated influenza vaccine A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) (Vasudevan et al., 2018) .
