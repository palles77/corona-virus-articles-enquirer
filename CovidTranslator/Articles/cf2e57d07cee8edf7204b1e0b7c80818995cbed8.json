Interestingly, two scFvs (B5 and B9) exhibited higher binding specificity to SARS-CoV with the OD 450 value 0.608 and 0.545, respectively, and their coding sequences shared the identical sequence composed of V H gene (351 bp) and V L gene (327 bp), so the two scFvs were uniformly named as SA59B and chosen for further analysis. SA59B scFv was expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli HB2151 and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The soluble 30 kDa SA59B scFv-antibody was verified in SDS-PAGE and Western-blot. The purified SA59B scFv-antibody was labeled with HRP by the glutaraldehyde method, and the concentration of HRP and SA59B scFv-antibody in the SA59B-HRP solution reached 2.4 and 2.28 mg/ml, respectively. Then, the binding ability of SA59B-HRP to SARS-CoV was evaluated by ELISA with S/N of 11.6, indicating higher binding specificity between them. Finally, both the SA59B sequence specificity and its application for diagnosis, prophylaxis or therapy of SARS were discussed.",

There are two most significant points in this technique one provides the natural linkage between the phenotype and genotype [6] ; the other lies in the fact that it allows specific screening based on binding affinity to a given target molecular by an in vivo selection process called panning [7] [8] [9] .

The results indicated that the coding sequences of B5 and B9 share identical sequence (Fig. 3) , which is composed of V H gene (351 bp) and V L gene (327 bp), and the two scFvs were uniformly designated as SA59B. The closest germline sequences for SA59B scFv-antibody gene could be identified by comparison with the database [13] [14] [15] . The V H gene use, the V H 3 family-derived germline V3-23, D3-9, D7-27, and J H 4b genes, while the V L gene uses the V L 1 (V-kappa subgroup I, V k -1) family-derived germline 02 (012) and J k 1 genes (Fig. 3) . Also, a high degree of mutation appeared in the V H CDR2 (CDR, complementarity-determining region) with 70.6% (bases) and 58.8% (amino acids) sequence homology to the closest germline match (Table 1). In addition, there was a replacement mutation (position 282, T fi G) that led to generation of a stop codon TGA in the V H FWR3 (FWR, functional framework region), which could surprisingly be suppressed when the scFv-phages were expressed in E. coli TG1 or HB2151. Any errors introduced during the amplification of DNA can be excluded, because we sequenced B5 and B9 scFvs repeatedly in two different companies (see Materials and methods) and obtained the same results. The deduced amino acid sequence of heavy and light chains of SA59B is shown in Fig. 3 , and the predicted molecular weight of the whole soluble scFv was about 30 kDa. The expression of soluble SA59B scFv-antibody and its identification SA59B was chosen for expression analysis. The samples aspirated according to induced time were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Western blot analysis (Fig. 4) was performed according to the former described method. We concluded that the scFv-antibody was expressed with MW of 30 kDa since its polyhistidine tail was conformed in Western-blot.",

            "text": "Although the precise mechanism of this action was unknown, our study suggested that SA59B scFv-antibody or SA59B-HRP had a high binding specificity to SARS-CoV in ELISA. Since it reacted well with SARS-CoV, it is also conceivable that it might restore its binding properties in the form of fusion proteins after expression as soluble scFvs in E. coli HB2151 or labeling as scFv-horseradish peroxidase, which was described by others [16] [17] [18] . Notably, the SDS-PAGE results of SA59B-HRP solution may also provide evidence for this point. The SA59B-HRP migrated as a single protein band on SDS-PAGE, and it had an estimated molecular mass of 66.2 kDa, which was obviously less than 74 kDa, the total molecular weight of SA59B scFv-antibody (30 kDa) and HRP (44 kDa). Furthermore, the creation of scFvs fused to other protein is believed to lead to the formation of dimers [16] , which should have greater avidity and stability than original monovalent scFvs, and can be used, for example, for detection purposes. At present, the laboratory tests that can be applied for routine diagnosis of SARS mainly include detecting viral genome by PCR involving in RT-PCR [19] [20] [21] [22] and RT-LAMP [23] , and detecting serum antibodies using SARS-CoV from Vero cell culture by ELI-SA [24] [25] [26] , IFA [27] [28] [29] , and NT [2] . However, there is little progress in detection of SARS-CoV using scFv-antibodies. So, we anticipate that SA59B scFv-antibody or SA59B-HRP described here will be useful in detection of SARS-CoV.",

Fortunately, progresses are being made in the development of new drugs and vaccines against SARS although no antiviral treatments are currently available against SARS-CoV. For example, complete inhibition of cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV in culture was observed for interferon subtypes, b-1b, a-n1, a-n3, and human leukocyte interferon a [31] ; the in vitro efficacy of a recombinant human type I interferon IFN-b 1a (Serono International, Geneva, Switzerland) against three different isolates of SARS-CoV (Tor2, Tor7, and Urbani) using yield reduction assays was evaluated [32] ; a three-dimensional model of the SARS-CoV-encoded 3 CL proteinase has been constructed to direct the design of protease inhibitors that may block coronavirus replication [32] , and so on. Our scFv-antibodies obtained by us directed against purified SARS-CoV lysate may also be ideal vaccine candidates or effective molecule guiders for prophylaxis or therapy.",

Currently, efforts are underway to improve the sensitivity of SA59B-HRP ELISA assay and to further confirm its acting target(s) to develop their clinical applications. ''n'' expresses test number. ''S/N'' is an absorbance OD 450 ratio of sample to negative control. The sign'' ** '' indicates the deviation from the absorbance OD 450 between experimental groups and negative controls was dramatically significant (P < 0.01). The ELISA positive was defined as S/N > 2.1.",
