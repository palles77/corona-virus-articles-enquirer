The virus was first identified in The Netherlands in 2001, and shown to cause acute respiratory tract infections in children ( Van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . Since then, surveillance studies have demonstrated that virtually all children are infected with hMPV between the ages 5 and 10 years (Ebihara et al., 2003; Leung et al., 2005; Wolf et al., 2003) . hMPV has subsequently been identified in Asia (Peiris et al., 2003) , Australia (Nissen et al., 2002) , North America (Bastien et al., 2003; Esper et al., 2003; Peret et al., 2002) and Brazil (Cuevas et al., 2003) , where it has been linked to respiratory illness ranging from upper respiratory tract infection to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in patients of all age groups. Sequence analysis has revealed two major subgroups (A and B), each with two minor genetic clusters (A1, A2 and B1, B2) ( Van den Hoogen et al., 2004) . Infections with hMPV may be severe in the young, the elderly (Falsey et al., 2003) and the immune-compromised (Kumar et al., 2005; Larcher et al., 2005; Martino et al., 2005; William et al., 2005) .",

The majority of the respiratory samples positive for hMPV (n = 87; 44%) were in children <1 year of age. Thirty-three (0.6%) of 5500 respiratory samples from adults (>18 years old) were positive for hMPV. Within this group, eight (24%) had severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and four (12%) were managed in an intensive therapy unit (ITU), two of whom died. Mixed infections involving hMPV were found in five samples, with corona virus being the major co-pathogen. of Crohn's disease (for which she received steroids and azathioprine), developed a severe lower respiratory tract infection when she was hospitalized for an exacerbation of Crohn's disease in mid-January 2006. The cough and difficulty in breathing, which was initially mild, gradually worsened; she then rapidly de-saturated and required supportive ventilation. Chest X-ray initially showed right middle lobe consolidation that progressed to involve both lung fields diffusely within 48 h. hMPV was strongly positive by RT-PCR on the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL). She also had a low positive rhinovirus by RT-PCR in the same sample. She recovered completely after withdrawal of azathioprine and reduction in the dosage of steroids.",

He took ill while being repatriated from Hong Kong to the UK in January 2006, requiring oxygen on the flight. On arrival in Glasgow his condition deteriorated quite rapidly, needing ITU admission for ventilation support. A chest X-ray showed marked diffuse bilateral alveolar shadowing with significant consolidation in the left lower zone. He showed increasing signs of sepsis and his respiratory function worsened. A BAL sample, taken on the sixth day of ITU admission was positive for hMPV by RT-PCR and immuno-fluorescent staining. He succumbed to worsening respiratory failure, and died on the 21st day of his stay in ITU. Subsequent autopsy revealed the presence of hMPV in the lung tissue, both by RT-PCR and by immune staining (Fig. 2) .",

In contrast, in our study 25 of the 33 adults with respiratory samples positive for hMPV also had LRTI. Chest X-ray changes ranged from infiltration to collapse and consolidation. Four developed respiratory failure, requiring ITU admissions, and two died. This might reflect some selection bias, in that; we are more likely to receive samples from patients with severe disease and varying degrees of immune suppression. Nevertheless, our findings are in contrast to that of an Irish study (Carr et al., 2005) , which retrospectively examined 168 BAL samples from adults: four had hMPV infection; none were severe, including in two patients with underlying immunosuppressive disorders.",

The bone-marrow transplant unit in Bristol reported the isolation of hMPV from the nasopharyngeal aspirate of a 33-year-old SCT recipient, who subsequently died of respiratory failure (Cane et al., 2003) . Testing for hMPV by RT-PCR was done retrospectively on a stored nasopharyngeal-aspirate sample. A lung-transplant unit in Austria detected hMPV in the BAL samples of nine lung-transplant recipients in -2004 (Larcher et al., 2005 . Two of them developed fatal obliterative bronchiolitis and four had acute rejection. The two fatal cases in our report were post-SCT, in whom hMPV was demonstrated in the BAL and endo-tracheal aspirate samples by RT-PCR and by direct immunofluorescent antibody staining in the BAL sample. We were also able to demonstrate hMPV in the autopsy lung specimen of one patient, both by RT-PCR and by immune staining (Fig. 2) .",

There were a further two SCTs, in whom the LRTI caused by hMPV was less severe. In another study, it was shown that in a child with lymphoblastic leukaemia, hMPV infection caused repeated respiratory infections in two different seasons, but without significant morbidity (Pelletier et al., 2002) . Whether these differences in clinical presentation of hMPV-associated respiratory infections in the different patient groups are due to the biological properties of the different hMPV genotypes or varying degrees of immune suppression in the affected persons, needs further elucidation.",
