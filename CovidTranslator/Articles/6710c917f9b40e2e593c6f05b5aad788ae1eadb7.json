It is of great significance to study the law of cross-regional spread of the epidemic, for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 in the future in China and other countries or regions. In this study, the cross-regional connection intensity between cities was characterized based on the probability and the effective distance of the shortest path tree, and the empirical analysis was carried out based on the high-frequency data such as the cases of COVID 19 outbreaks. It is concluded that the higher the intensity of inter-city connection, the larger scale the cross-regional spread of the epidemic.",

            "text": "The epidemic of infectious diseases is a complex spreading process that occurs in population. There is a long history of modeling infectious disease epidemics (Anderson et al., 1992) , and various modeling paradigms have been developed. Kermark & Mckendrick (1927) proposed the classic SIR model, which is a compartmental model. Assuming that every individual is the same, the population is homogeneous mixing. The contact is instant and independent of history, infection rate and recovery rate are constant. All people in the same state form a compartment, and as the state changes, personnel move between the compartments. With the growth of urban population and the development of transportation networks, social mobility has increased, and the spatial expansion of infectious diseases has shown a new pattern. Especially when people move between different regions, the spread of infectious diseases is very common. Understanding the impact of human movement patterns on the prevalence of infectious diseases has attracted considerable attention (Gonzalez et al., 2008) , and a meta-population model derived from ecology has been applied in the field of infectious diseases. With the rise of complexity science, the micro-modeling specification has been developed and combined with social networks, a network-based micro-individual modeling method has been developed, which provides a new way to understand the spread of infectious diseases. These models enable epidemiologists and health authorities to understand the transmission process, predict its impact on healthy populations, and assess the After the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, most of the research focused on estimating the source, transmission characteristics and the estimation of the scale (Mizumoto et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; H\u00e9bert-Dufresne et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2020; Yeo et al., 2020) . In particular, the basic reproduction ratio has been widely debated as a parameter that reflects the speed of virus transmission. Some literatures analyzed the spread of COVID-19 using population migration data, which are calculated based on the migration outflow from Wuhan (Zhan et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020) , Little attention has been paid to the spread of the nationwide and even global cities caused by population migration. There is also a literature on how to intervene and control the spread of the COVID-19 virus (Qian et al., 2020; Heymann & Shindo, 2020) ; Gao et al., 2020) .",

What is the effective distance? The effective distance between cities is the length selected by a passenger in various selectable routes from city i to city j. A passenger can be regarded as a random walking particle, who randomly visits the surrounding cities according to the traffic flow. After arriving at the next city, it is converted into a probability to visit the neighboring cities of the next city according to the traffic flow... Finally, the path which the particle most likely to choose from city i to city j is namely the most likely path. The length of this most likely path is the effective distance. We argue that this probabilistic effective distance is related to the flow of population and the degree of transportation convenience, and can reflect the strength of the spatial connection between cities. The effective distance varies with the strength of the spatial connection. This concept is more accurate than traditional connection strength calculations based on the size and distance of the two cities, such as economic connection, market potential, and market access; it is also more accurate than simply using the population flow to characterize the connection, because it cannot express the strength of the connection between the two cities, not to mention the convenience of the connection between the two cities.",

The content and implementation time of the measures come from the information or announcements issued by epidemic prevention and control headquarters in prefectural-level districts. We will explore the relationship between effective distance from Wuhan and the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in different cities. As shown in Figure 6 (b), the correlation between the proportion of the outflow of people from Wuhan and the number of cases is not significant on the whole. We analyze that there are two reasons cause the result: First, he incubation period of COVID-19 is long, the patients only have mild symptoms, such as fever, fatigue and cough. The paper titled \" Time-varying transmission dynamics of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in China \" published in the international medical authoritative journal \"the New England Journal of Medicine\" revealed that the average incubation period of new coronary pneumonia is 5.2 days ; Second is that the first cases reported in most cities are after January 20. Although the number of cases was not previously reported, the possibility of an earlier infection cannot be ruled out. It is estimated that the outbreak started much earlier, and both within China and international infectious exports occurred before January and in early January.

On the one hand, the government, society, and residents should make concerted efforts to jointly control, accelerating the speed of epidemic control; on the other hand, we must strengthen the multi-faceted reserves of materials needed for epidemic prevention and control. the government, society, and residents jointly control and control, and work together to accelerate the speed of epidemic control; On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the multi-faceted stock of materials needed for epidemic prevention and control, so that comprehensive measures can be taken when the epidemic occurs Third, investment in public health resources should be strengthened. The more developed the city is, the easier it is for people to contact, and the larger the scale of population flow, the easier it is for the epidemic to spread. Therefore, the more developed the economy, the more it is necessary to increase investment in public health resources. All rights reserved.

Among them, a total of 67,801 confirmed cases in Hubei Province (50006 cases in Wuhan), 3169 death cases (2531 cases in Wuhan), and 3431 confirmed cases (3407 cases in Wuhan). The cumulative number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province accounted for 83.7% of mainland China, and the number of deaths accounted for 96.4% of Mainland China, of which Wuhan accounted for 61.7% and 76.9% of Mainland China respectively. The epidemicTable 1Regional distribution of COVID -19 cases in mainland China as of , which classifies public health emergencies into particularly major (level I), major (level II), large (level III) and general (level IV) level 4. According to the plan of level I response, the provincial government is responsible for emergency response, adopts preventive control measures in time, adopts emergency mobilization and collection of relevant personnel, materials, vehicles, related facilities, and equipment, adopts isolated sites and blocks epidemic areas to ensure various supplies needed in emergency response. Butbefore the \"lockdown\" of Wuhan, according to statistics, millions of citizens have left Wuhan, and they may be the main source of the COVID-19 infection in other parts of China. Therefore, it is of a certain value to analyze the impact of Wuhan's intercity connection with other regions on the spread of the epidemic and the role of local prevention and control measures. Observe the distribution of the COVID-19 confirmed cases in various regions of Hubei Province and other provinces (cities and districts) in China. The number of cases did not increase with the proximity of Wuhan, even in Hubei province. Then, an important question is that the cities have different degrees of economic and personnel links with Wuhan. Does the link have an internal relationship with the spread of the epidemic? The public health policies for COVID-19 prevention and control in different regions are not exactly the same, and the degree of strictness also varies. It is also an important question of how such prevention and control measures are matched with the degree of spread.",
