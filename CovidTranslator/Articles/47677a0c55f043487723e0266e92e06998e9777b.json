Longitudinal data were drawn from orally administered surveys with 70 affected or at-risk individuals concerning their thoughts, feelings, and decision making about testing for mutations in BMPR2. Distress was measured by use of the Impact of Events Scale. Variations in tolerance for ambiguity were also examined. Although uptake of testing was low, as is common for incompletely penetrant mutations that lack clear therapeutic interventions, we found that those who participated in testing evidenced greater reduction in distress compared to those who had not participated in testing, irrespective of test result. No differences in tolerance for ambiguity by testing status were found. Participation in genetic testing, irrespective of test results, may be particularly beneficial to individuals who may have genetic mutations and who are experiencing high levels of distress.",

            "text": "P articipation in predisposition genetic testing to assess disease risk is increasingly common. Nonetheless, at-risk patients vary widely in the decision to undergo testing once a test becomes available. This is true even in cases where patients expressed high levels of interest in testing prior to the discovery of the genes involved (Codori et al., 1999) . Not surprisingly, the most potent predictor of uptake is the availability of effective and acceptable preventive and therapeutic interventions (Barnoy, 2007) . Other variably predictive indicators of uptake (Ropka et al., 2006) include levels of distress (Keller et al., 2004; Dorval et al., 2008) , higher perceived disease risk (Shiloh and Ilan, 2005) , greater worry about disease (Foster et al., 2004) , anticipated ability to handle adverse results (Thompson et al., 2002; Hadley et al., 2003) , test readiness (Taylor, 2005) , desire for emotional relief (Smith et al., 2004) , and lower levels of depression (Codori et al., 1999; Lerman et al., 1999) . Often those who undergo predictive genetic testing believe that their risk for developing a disorder is high, even in cases where risk is, in fact, low. In many instances, participation in genetic testing is a method for coping with concerns about disease risk, irrespective of actual level of risk (Metcalfe et al., 2007) .",

To date, most research on the effects of predictive genetic testing uti-lizes an ''informative model,'' assessing knowledge of and reactions to accurate information, and focusing on processes of cognitive decision making and psychological adaptation prior to and after results (Lerman and Croyle, 1996) . In contrast, ''transactional models'' of stress and coping include an emphasis on behavioral adaptation to aversive states of mind or circumstance (Gooding et al., 2006) and receive less attention. This study seeks to expand the framework for understanding coping responses to genetic testing by focusing on determinants and effects of participation in testing as a form of behavioral coping with distress, irrespective of degree of risk or test results.",

Most studies of predisposition testing have concentrated heavily on two broad groups of disorders, cancer and neurological disorders. Because of the particular social meaning of these two groups of disorders, research on predictors of uptake may not be completely generalizable to the full gamut of disorders for which predisposition genetic testing is becoming available. The risk of cancer, for example, evokes complex responses in the United States, ranging from fear to battle cries and solidarity. By contrast, neurological disorders are particularly stigmatizing. Recognizing the need to expand the types of disorders addressed, investigators have begun to explore why people chose to accept or decline predisposition genetic tests for other types of disorders, such as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (Dickson et al., 2008) , hemochromatosis (Patch et al., 2005) , and inflammatory bowel disease (Lewis et al., 2009) . Our focus on pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a disease which has received scant public attention, is an addition to this emergent body of research.",

            "text": "To gain perspective on how people use predisposition genetic testing, we began studying PAH more than a decade ago. This disorder is insidious, affects primarily younger women, and is poorly amenable to treatment (Badesch et al., 2009) . Characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, PAH causes shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, enlargement of the heart, and eventual heart failure. Although advances in treatment are prolonging life, most of the affected patients die within several years of diagnosis unless they receive a heart-lung transplant. In some cases, this disease is attributable to mutations in BMPR2 (Austin et al., 2009) . The mutations in this gene are only approximately 20% penetrant. As a result, PAH can ''run in'' families, and unaffected carriers can pass the mutation on to their affected children. Because mutations are incompletely penetrant, they are also found in some apparently ''sporadic'' cases, indicating that their family members are also at risk. Before the role of BMPR2 was defined, the majority of patients with PAH and their at-risk relatives expressed a desire to be tested (Lientz and Clayton, 2000) . When testing became clinically available and was offered to patients and at-risk relatives, however, uptake was very low (Hannig et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008) , as is common for predisposition tests for disorders for which there is no curative therapy. Using previously defined survey measures that are administered as part of telephone interviews, we sought to understand why some patients and at-risk individuals chose to pursue or to reject testing as well as the psychological impact of their decisions. We hypothesized that test users would have been more distressed and more intolerant of ambiguity prior to testing and that participation in testing would be helpful to them.",

As standard measures, we use the impact of events [Impact of Events Scale) IES] (Horowitz et al., 1979) and intolerance for ambiguity scales [Tolerance for Ambiguity Scale (TFA)] (Geller et al., 1993) . Distress has been found to increase likelihood of testing (Keller et al., 2004) and to vary, depending upon test results (Lerman and Croyle, 1996) . To date, no studies have explored changes to IES prior to and following participation in testing, irrespective of test results. In addition, intolerance for ambiguity is believed to have unique relevance to the field of genetic testing, given the probabilistic nature of test results for incompletely penetrant disorders, like PAH. Previous research suggests that those with a greater tolerance for ambiguity may have a stronger interest in discussing (Geller et al., 1993) and participating (Baty et al., 2006) in testing.

Prior to follow-up, all the respondents had been informed about the availability of clinical genetic testing for mutations in BMPR2 through study consent forms as well as from clinicians (91%) or through PHA support groups and newsletters (9%).",

The IES is a 15-item self-report questionnaire that has been widely used to assess levels of distress (Weiss, 2004) , in response to a range of events including exposure to traumatic incidents, prolonged environmental stressors, poor health status, and disease risk. More specifically, IES has been used and validated among persons at risk for respiratory (Chan and Chan, 2004) and pulmonary (Baumert et al., 2004) conditions. Eight IES items assess avoidance, while seven address intrusion. The frequency of each is rated on a 4-point scale, which is rated as 0 (not at all), 1 (rarely), 3 (sometimes), or 5 (often). The IES has demonstrated high internal consistency with alpha coefficients of 0.82 for avoidance and 0.78 for intrusion subscales. Split-half reliability of the total scale was 0.86 (Horowitz et al., 1979) . Alpha coefficients in this study sample are presented in the ''Results'' section of this article.",

Length of time between testing and follow-up interview ranged from several weeks to more than a year. Four of those tested had been recruited through the Vanderbilt clinic, one through the Vanderbilt PAH registry, and one through the Southeastern PAH support group. Given the small number of test accepters, there were no statistically significant differences by recruitment site or in the rate at which PAH-sporadic, FPAH, or FPAH-at-risk persons pursued testing. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences in the demographic characteristics between those who had been tested and those who had not. By the follow-up interview, four individuals who been tested had received their test results and two had not. When compared with nontesters, those who had chosen to have clinical testing for mutations in BMPR2 were more distressed at baseline, often exceeding levels diagnostic of PTSD, and they experienced a significant reduction in overall level of distress, including distress associated with intrusive thoughts about PAH and avoidance. Scores overall and in the nontested sample were positively skewed. This is consistent with other studies utilizing IES measures. To correct for skewness, square root transformations were conducted on each of the values when performing parametric statistics (Dougall et al., 1999) . Overall F values for repeated measure ANOVA are reported in Table 2 . Differences in IES by testing status are reported by Cohen's D. Effect sizes for the tested group are large (1.8 or above) and quite small for those who did not undergo genetic testing. Covariates' age, gender, education, and race (White/non-White) were not significant, which did not impact significance of testing status, and were not included in Table 2 analysis. By contrast, those who were tested did not differ from those who were not tested in terms of their tolerance for ambiguity (No Test = 21.17, Tested = 22.84) (Geller et al., 1993) (Table 3) .",

Women who pursued testing for mutations in BRCA1/2, for example, often had higher levels of distress than those who did not (Lerman et al., 1997; Dorval et al., 2008) . Similarly, those who accept genetic counseling for cancer predisposing mutations were more often distressed than those who refused counseling (Halbert et al., 2004; Keller et al., 2004) . Following testing, others have found that the majority of test recipients do not experience significant levels of distress (Schwartz et al., 2002; Claes et al., 2005; Gritz et al., 2005; Bleiker et al., 2007; Hiraki et al., 2009) . Our findings provide support for the contention of Gooding et al. (2006) that participation in genetic testing may serve as a mechanism to alleviate distress for some at-risk individuals even when there are no clear preventive actions available. Test acceptors and decliners did not differ, however, in their tolerance for test ambiguity even though desire to reduce ambiguity is often cited as a major reason for pursuing testing (Baty et al., 2006) .",

Others researches have observed that poor mental health status (Licklederer et al., 2008) and a history of depression prior to testing (Gargiulo et al., 2009) increase the likelihood of increased distress and negative effects following testing. The effects of these, and other factors that are likely to influence participation in genetic testing, were not addressed in this analysis and reflect an important limitation of our study. Two other significant limitations are the small sample size (albeit large for this rare disease) and low rate of test uptake, which made it possible to detect only the largest differences between test users and those who did not undergo testing. Covariates' age, race, educational status, gender, and other factors might well be influential predictors, not revealed in this small sample. This limitation may be unavoidable in studies that attempt to examine the impact of predisposition genetic testing for rare, difficult-to-treat disorders with low penetrance, since the population affected is notably small and uptake is frequently low. For example, although the majority of the respondents in this study said that they planned to be tested, the level of uptake we observed is consistent with that of Hannig et al. (2008) who specifically offered testing to 23 families with known mutations in BMPR2. Moreover, unaf-fected respondents with a family history of PAH were less likely to participate in the second interview. This is unfortunate since this group could have different motivations and fears regarding genetic testing than people who are already affected, who frequently pursue testing to obtain information for family members ( Jones et al., 2008) . Despite these limitations, the study adds to the literature in a number of ways. It is one of the first longitudinal studies of individuals who may have inherited a predisposing mutation linked to a singlegene disorder other than cancer or neurological diseases. The low level of uptake may well be characteristic of tests for partially penetrant mutations, especially those associated with poorly treatable diseases. Clinicians need to be aware of the correlation of high levels of disease-related distress with test acceptance observed in this study and others. Participation in genetic testing, irrespective of test results, may be particularly beneficial to individuals who may have genetic mutations and who are experiencing high levels of distress.",
