We studied 57 MS patients and 59 controls with similar age and sex distributions. In MS patients, we found the classical increased frequency of HLA-DR2, HLA-DQwl and also an excess of Gm (3; -+23; 5+). Mumps antibody levels were higher in MS patients than in controls; elevation was not significant for measles antibodies.

            "text": "The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is complex and many facts observed repeatedly during the two last decades still remain unexplained. Elevated antibody titers al'e found in serum and cerebro~pinai fluid of patients with MS, against measles, and less frequently against other viruses including herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, rubella, vaccinia, influenza, and Epstein-Barr viruses [1] [2] [3] . These findings can be interpreted in various ways. Elevated antibody titers may be either a consequence of the disease itself, or in relation with the role of various common viruses in the pathogenesis of MS. Another explanation is that increased levels of viral anti-0198-8859/91/$3.50 between HLA-DQwl and antibody liters against various viruses exists in controls but is absent in MS patients. In particular, we found that mumps antibody liters were higher in DQwl-positive than in DQwl-negative controls, while there was no significant difference among MS cases. Accordingly, we found that the overall difference between patients and controls was due to the fact that DQwl-positive patients had higher tilers than controls, while DQwl-negative cases had similar titers as controls. These findings suggest that biological and molecular characteristics of DQwl might differ in MS patients. Human Immunology 31, 94-99 (1991) MS multiple sclerosis bodies in MS patients may be related to immunogenetic factors associated with MS. Thus, because of specific structural co +r, plemer,,.~rit/e~ of aatige.,:s, immun~ response against viral antigens lnighi be controlled by genes linked with the HLA alleles associated with MS. This hypothesis is supported by several reports on the difference in response to vaccines (poliomyelitis, diphtheria typhoid, vaccinia virus) and viral antigens (rubella, measles, influenze, and Epstein-Barr viruses) in relation with HLA phenotypes [4] [5] [6] [7] , especially with HLA-DR antigens. Antibody levels after immunization against various infectious agents depend also on genes coding for immunoglobulin G heavy chains (Gm) [8] , and association between Gm allotypes and susceptibility to MS has been reported [9, 10] . The purpose of our study was to investigate possible interrelations between viral antibody titres, HLA-class II antigens and immunoglobulin Gm allotypes in MS patients and controls.",
