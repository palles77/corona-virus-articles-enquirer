            "text": "Quantitative multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays utilizing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hybridization probes were developed for the detection of 13 respiratory viruses, including well recognized viral causes (respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, and 3, adenovirus) as well as viruses described recently as causes of acute respiratory tract infections (human coronaviruses NL63, HKU1, 229E, and OC43, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus). FRET probes have an improved toleration for single base mismatches than other probe chemistries, reducing the chances of missing highly variable RNA viruses. The assay could detect 2.5-25 DNA/RNA copies/l (2.5 \u00d7 10 3 -2.5 \u00d7 10 4 copies/ml). Validation on 91 known positive respiratory specimens indicated similar specificity as commercial direct immunofluorescence assays (IFA) or single-round PCRs used in initial identification. Screening of 270 IFA negative respiratory specimens identified new viruses in 40/270 (14.8%) cases and additional 79/270 (29.3%) well recognized viruses missed by routine diagnostic assays including 6.7% co-infections. All viruses could be detected in the clinical screening panel. The assays demonstrates an improved sensitivity and scope of detecting respiratory viruses relative to routine antigen detection assays while the quantitative utility may facilitate investigation of the role of co-infections and viral load in respiratory virus pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infection is a leading cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality (Murray et al., 2001) . Well recognized viral agents traditionally associated with respiratory tract infections are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1-3, and adenoviruses (Adv). Since 2001, improved virus discovery techniques have seen to the identification of several new viruses associated with acute respiratory tract infections including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) , human coronaviruses (hCoV) HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005) and NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004) , and human bocavirus (hBoV) (Allander et al., 2005) . At present, the most commonly used technique for the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections is cell culture usually in combination with direct immunofluorescence assays (IFA) (Fischbach and Dunning, 2009 ). Nucleic acid detection methods have recently become more readily available for the diagnosis of virus infections (Watzinger et al., 2006) . Comparative studies have shown that for the detection of respiratory viruses real-time RT-PCR is significantly more sensitive than conventional detection methods (Gharabaghi et al., 2008; Kuypers et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2003; van de Pol et al., 2007) . The majority of real-time RT-PCR detection assays for respiratory viruses are only qualitative of nature. Even though qualitative real-time PCR in the diagnostic setting has numerous advantages over more traditional detection methods, one of the limitations is that it does not discriminate between current infections or shedding of low concentration of virus from previous infections. The significance of co-infections is also not portrayed. In contrast, quantitative realtime PCR provides qualitative as well as quantitative information. The advantages of quantitative real-time PCR are that it permits the assessment of viral load at a given time point, facilitates the monitoring of response to treatment, and offers the possibility to determine the dynamics of virus proliferation (Watzinger et al., 2006) . Quantitative tests may aid in the study of virus pathogenesis, development of vaccine and antiviral strategies, and will facilitate investigations of the importance of respiratory viruses when detected by themselves or as co-infections in patients.",

These studies employ the use of hydrolysis probes (Brittain-Long et al., 2008; Gunson et al., 2005) and molecular beacons (Templeton et al., 2004) as probe chemistry which are highly sensitive to hybridization mismatches. Due to the high mutation frequencies of respiratory viral genomes this may result in false negative results (Gunson et al., 2006) . In contrast, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) hybridization probes can tolerate up to 6 mismatches (Zaayman et al., 2009 ). In addition, the probes are not hydrolyzed during the amplification reaction, thereby facilitating generation of amplicon-specific melting curves for further discrimination and incorporation of multiple targets per reaction.",

The newly designed real-time RT-PCR assays were initially optimized as monospecific assays. To assess the specificity of the primers and probes, the assays were tested for cross-reactivity among the 13 viruses using control specimens with viral loads of approximately 1 \u00d7 10 7 -1 \u00d7 10 9 copies/ml. In all cases each virus was only detected by its specific primer and probe set, no cross-reaction was observed. The monospecific assays were subsequently combined to form four multiplex assays comprising of the following viruses: Multiplex 1-RSV A and B, hMPV, hBoV; Multiplex 2-parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, and 3, hCoV-NL63; Multiplex 3-influenza A and B, adenovirus; Multiplex 4-hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, and hCoV-229E. Viruses were combined into the various multiplex assays according to shared similarities in clinical manifestations and susceptible age groups. The sensitivity of the assays was determined in triplicate through the amplification of serially diluted in vitro transcribed RNA from cloned controls. Detection limits for RNA viruses ranged from 2.5 to 25 in vitro transcribed RNA copies/l (corresponds to 2.5 \u00d7 10 3 -2.5 \u00d7 10 4 copies/ml of specimen) and 25 plasmid DNA copies/l for DNA viruses (corresponds to 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 copies/ml of specimen) ( Table 2) . Lower concentrations were detected, however, at these concentrations detection of all replicates could not be achieved and was therefore not considered true detection limits. To assess the inter-run precision of the respective assays, extraction and real-time RT-PCR detection were performed on triplicate aliquots from viral suspensions. Three independent real-time RT-PCR runs performed showed a coefficient of variation of between 0.03% and 3.05% (Table 2) , indicating high reproducibility of the real-time RT-PCR assays. All four multiplexes were optimized to be performed under the same cycling conditions for simultaneous use. In the event that a 60-nt conserved region could not be identified, a technique described by Pont-Kingdon and Lyon (2005) was used to overcome this. This technique was applied to probes used for the detection of RSV A and B, and PIV-2.",

For the detection of respiratory viruses targeted by routine IFA, the multiplex assays were shown to be as specific as the routinely used commercial IFA but also to be significantly more sensitive, increasing the detection of these viruses by 29.3%. Inclusion of the additional respiratory viruses in the detection assay increased the overall detection frequency by a further 9.7%. Discrepant results in the study may be attributable to the increased sensitivity of real-time PCR. For the detection of RSV, a previous study reported 50-90% of specimens positive by PCR but negative by IFA had viral loads less than 1 \u00d7 10 6 copies/ml, suggesting a lower limit of sensitivity for IFA in this range (Kuypers et al., 2004) . In this study, the assay demonstrated a detection limit ranging between 2.5 \u00d7 10 3 and 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 copies/ml, which is >2 logs lower than the approximate IFA detection limit. These detection limits should be fitting for the detection of respiratory viruses, as previously reported viral loads in respiratory specimens ranged between 1 \u00d7 10 3 and 1 \u00d7 10 11 copies/ml (Kuypers et al., 2006) .

Since res-piratory specimens are difficult to standardise, quantitation of respiratory viruses by PCR is better described as semi-quantitative (Schildgen et al., 2008) . In this study, semi-quantitative results of RSV positive patients with mild and severe disease demonstrated a significantly higher RSV viral load in patients with severe disease confirming the relevance of this feature and confirms previous findings for RSV (DeVincenzo et al., 2005; Fodha et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2008) . Continuous detection of the internal control (GAPDH) indicated that quantitation was not influenced by poor RNA extraction or PCR inhibitors.",

A pitfall of real-time PCR is that the more commonly used probe chemistries (hydrolysis probes and molecular beacons) are highly sensitive to mismatches, which may lead to false negative results if point mutations occur (Gunson et al., 2006) . In contrast, the assays described in this study utilize two FRET hybridization probes which have the advantage of being able to tolerate a greater number of mismatches than hydrolysis probes or molecular beacons, decreasing the occurrence of false negative results substantially. The benefit of FRET probes was illustrated here; where point mutations were detected in the sites where the probe hybridized to the target template in several clinical specimens despite complete conservation of this area on GenBank. An obstacle when designing FRET hybridization probes is that a conserved area of approximately 60 nt is needed for the two probes to bind. In highly variable virus genomes this might pose a problem. However, this can be overcome by using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to conserved regions flanking a variable region as described by Pont-Kingdon and Lyon (2005) . Binding of the probe brings the two conserved regions together, resulting in the variable region to loop out, thereby omitting variable sequences. If a 60-nt conserved region could not be identified, as was the case for RSV and PIV 2, this technique was successfully applied to overcome this complication.",
