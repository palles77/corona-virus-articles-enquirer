Methods: This study utilized a questionnaire to collect institutional data about hospital infrastructure and volume of patient safety activities from all 1039 teaching hospitals in Japan. The patient safety activities were focused on meetings and conferences, internal audits, staff education and training, incident reporting and infection surveillance. Generalized linear modeling was used. Results: Of the 1039 hospitals surveyed, 418 (40.2%) hospitals participated. The amount of activities significantly increased by over 30% in hospitals with dedicated patient safety and infection control full-time staff (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). High profit margins also predicted the increase of patient safety programs (P < 0.01). Perceived lack of administrative leadership was associated with reduced volume of activities (P < 0.05), and the economic burden of safety programs was found to be disproportionately large for small hospitals (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Hospitals with increased resources had greater spread of patient safety and infection control activities. To promote patient safety programs in hospitals, it is imperative that policy makers require the assignment of dedicated full-time staff to patient safety. Economic support for hospitals will also be required to assure that safety programs are sustainable.",

            "text": "In 1999, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a pivotal report on safety in the health care system [1] . This report, which identified systemic gaps in patient safety systems, led to widespread development of new safety practices [2] . Despite the implementation of these safety practices, including those required by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), have the number of potential adverse events really decreased? While to the best of our knowledge, there has been no study that investigates the change of adverse events (which may be impossible due to the difficulties in identification of adverse events), some studies that focused on other indicators such as morbidity, failure to rescue and hospital-acquired infection have been reported. However, even these studies provide little evidence to suggest that the healthcare system is safer today than it was in 1999 [3] [4] [5] [6] . Small improvements in healthcare safety have not yet been reflected in national statistics [7] , suggesting that further work is needed to protect patients from adverse events [8, 9] . Considering that public regard for patient safety issues have risen since 1999 in Japan and other countries including the United States (US) [1, 10] and the state of implementation of patient safety systems in Japan is similar to that of the US [11] , the phenomena in the US seem to be similar to the state of patient safety in Japan.",

            "text": "The movement toward improved patient safety continues to face significant barriers, including a lack of incentives for hospitals to develop safety programs [10, 12] . First reason of a lack of incentive is the problem of the financial costs and benefits. Implementing hospital-wide safety practices requires considerable financial investment [10, 11] . Although these costs may be theoretically offset by savings associated with improved care and fewer adverse events [13, 14] , in practice these savings are rarely apparent to hospital administrators [4] . Few measurement tools have been developed to accurately gauge the impact of safety programs [7, 15] , limiting the ability of hospitals to definitely link safety practices with improved patient care. Second barrier is concerned with public perception. A lack of data on hospital safety frequently limits the number of choices patients have in selecting a hospital, such that hospitals without safety programs are not necessarily penalized by reduced patient volume. The high cost and limited hospital benefit of patient safety programs makes the decision to implement rigorous safety practices extremely difficult.",

            "text": "In light of these barriers, financial incentives for quality care have been considered as an approach to encouraging hospitals to adopt patient safety practices [7] . When considering incentive programs, policy makers must understand the factors that influence the spread of system-level activities to improve patient safety. One such factor may indeed be financial considerations, and it is possible that the issue of patient safety might be a low priority for those who manage hospital finance [7, 12, 16] . A second factor that may play a role in the increase of patient safety measures is the presence of dedicated full-time staff for patient safety and infection control. It is clear that the presence of dedicated full-time infection control nurse have had success in implementing systematic infection control programs [17] , which in turn have led to reduced rates of nosocomial infections [18, 19] . While it remains difficult to evaluate the impact of patient safety programs on outcomes such as decreased adverse events because of lack of evaluation tools and difficulty in measuring rare outcomes over short time periods for small samples of patients with progressive diseases [15] , the utility of employing this type of dedicated staffing as a mechanism to expand patient safety practices can be assessed. The Institute of Healthcare Improvement breakthrough collaboratives, for example, examined the presence or absence of implemented prevention programs in hospitals as a measure of outcome [20] . Finally, hospital size and infrastructure may influence the amount of safety programs. Because the financial investments involved in patient safety systems are development and maintenance costs, rather than the costs of safety practices for each individual inpatient, the economic burden associated with patient safety might be disproportionately large for small hospitals. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that there are economies of scale in the cost of patient safety and infection control programs [10] .",

To date, however, few studies have evaluated the impact of these factors (e.g. financial condition, staffing resources and hospital infrastructure) on the amount of investments for patient safety and infection control programs. Expecting hospitals to unilaterally shoulder the burdens of maintaining patient safety systems is unrealistic due to a lack of incentives for hospitals to do so, which ultimately reduces the patient's right to safer health care. Therefore, policy makers are required to develop safer healthcare delivery systems; wherever patients visit, they will receive safe medical care because all hospitals will have effective patient safety programs. The purpose of the present study was therefore to identify which hospital characteristics are positively correlated with the spread of patient safety activities including infection control, for use in designing an incentive structure to promote patient safety and infection control for the purpose of decision making to allocate additional resources for patient safety.",

In an effort to systematically increase patient safety measures, the Japanese government issued a series of patient safety regulations to be implemented in all teaching hospitals [10] . By requiring these practices to be implemented throughout Japan, the impact of location on spread of patient safety programs was significantly diminished. Because the financial and human resources of a hospital vary significantly between ownership structures, however, university-associated hospitals were able to encourage amount of patient safety programs to a much greater degree than municipal hospitals that are often smaller and have less profit margins. No corresponding government intervention, however, took place for infection control by the year 2006. In Japan, geographic isolation tends to produce greater disparities in access to resources than does variations in hospital ownership structures. Therefore, policies requiring specific programs might impact the increase of patient safety programs to a certain level. This information regarding the relationship between policy and patient safety will be important in the further development of hospital regulations.",

            "text": "The positive impact of profit margins on the spread of patient safety programs has important policy implications. The finding that increased profit margins are predictive factors for person-time values in the patient safety model suggests that the issue of patient safety may be a low priority for hospital administrators. Previous research has found that leadership may be a critical influence in advancing patient safety [20, 28, 29] . Confirming the role of hospital administration in implementation of safety programs, perceived administrative leadership was also significantly related to the size of both patient safety and infection control practices (P < 0.05). However, when we changed the cut-point of the scales measuring the perceived leadership for patient safety and infection control to categorize the response of \"neutral\" as \"agree\" (the model shown in Table 3 used the cut-point to include the response of \"neutral\" into \"not agree\"), the results of the impact of perceived leadership on the amount of activity was only changed in the infection control model. There were no substantial changes in coefficient value and the significance of each predictor variable except for the administrative leadership variable in the infection control model. Therefore, when we consider the impact of administrative leadership on infection control activities, a cautious interpretation would be needed. In contrast to the profit margin findings for patient safety, there was no association between increased profit margins and spread of infection control practices. One explanation for these discrepancies between patient safety and infection control model may again be the lack of government regulatory control over infection control practices in Japan. Hospital administrators may be more likely to prioritize a program that is presented as a national requirement, as is the case for patient safety programs.",

            "text": "In accordance with our hypothesis (that financial status, staffing resources and hospital infrastructure would be potential predictors of spread of activities for patient safety and infection control), hospitals with sufficient staffing resources (the presence of dedicated full-time staff and nurse-to-patient ratios) were significantly linked to increased person-time values. Although few studies examined the mechanism of this effect, prior studies have reported increased nurse-topatient ratio to be inversely associated with nosocomial infection rates [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . By demonstrating the positive impact of nurse-to-patient ratios on spread of infection control activities, our findings lend support to these conclusions. Our results also showed increased spread of both patient safety and infection control activities with the presence of dedicated full-time staffing (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively), despite the political differences in regulatory control of the two systems. This result was consistent with findings previously reported in infection control [17] [18] [19] , but to our knowledge is the first such finding in the field of patient safety. To promote the spread of hospital safety programs, therefore, it may be necessary to develop policies around dedicated full-time staffing, rather than more specific requirements that safety programs be implemented. The economic impact of such policies would include the costs associated with assigning dedicated staff to safety activities, as well as the costs of conducting increased numbers of hospitalwide patient safety and infection control activities. To avoid undue strain on staffing resources and the healthcare system, government financial support would be essential in offsetting these costs and promoting patient safety.",

Because the financial investments involved in patient safety systems are development and maintenance costs, rather than the costs of safety practices for each individual inpatient, the economic burden associated with patient safety is disproportionately large for small hospitals. Our results match these theoretical expectations. As reported in our earlier study [10] , these economies of scale play a significant role in the total cost of patient safety activities, a factor which should be weighed in considering incentive schemes for hospitals of varying sizes.",

Firstly, our study sample was limited to teaching hospitals, which tend to have greater financial and human resources than non-teaching hospitals. The study results may therefore not be generalizable to non-teaching hospitals, which are often smaller and have fewer resources. Secondly, all responses were self-reported, and may thereby be subject to reporting bias. Because responders were aware that survey responses would be anonymous, however, we believe that survey results were a reasonable reflection of actual patient safety and infection control activities. In fact, although 34.7% of hospitals voluntarily identified themselves, no difference in person-time values were noted between these hospitals and those who chose to remain anonymous. Thirdly, the survey possibly underestimates the total investment for patient safety. Since we evaluated the activities of maintaining patient safety systems based on hospital-level activities, investments made at the patient-(e.g. bed side nursing time and informed consent), unit-(e.g. nurse manager investigates errors) and department-(e.g. department measures or safety) levels were not included. However, as stated by the Institute of Medicine [1] , since the most important strategy for improving patient safety is to develop systems that will reduce the probability of error and improve the probability of safety, targeting hospitallevel efforts would seem to be adequate focus for this study.",
