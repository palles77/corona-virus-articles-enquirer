At present, the domestic outbreak has been effectively controlled, while the new coronavirus is spreading rapidly in other areas. Currently, Europe has become the center of the current outbreak of new pneumonia. Meanwhile, on March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a new pneumonia outbreak a \"global pandemic.\" The new coronavirus has caused a great threat to the health and safety of people all over the world due to its amazing spreading power and potential harm. The research on the domestic and international epidemics and the future development trend has become a hot topic of current research. At present, many teams have studied the transmission law and preventive measures of the COVID-19 (Corman et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020; Rothe et al., 2020) , and many meaningful results have been obtained (Mizumoto & Chowell, 2020; Riou & Althaus, 2020; Shao & Wu, 2020) .",

By simulating the propagation process of the COVID-19, we found that the curves of proposed model well simulate the official data curves of Hubei, Non-Hubei area of China and also South Korea, Italy, and Iran. The study points out the key factors that affect the spread of the virus, such as the basic reproduction number, virus incubation period, and daily infection number. At the same time, we predict the development trend of epidemics in different regions and infer the time of the initial cases. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of different control times on the spread of the epidemic. Relevant models and data analysis can provide some basis and guidance for the related countries about epidemic prevention and control.",

Through a large number of simulations, we found that the basic regeneration number is 3.8, and the second and third phases are controlled phases. The basic regeneration numbers are respectively It is 0.5 and 0.1 (see the yellow line in Fig. 3 ). The simulated curve (yellow line) can be closer to the official diagnosis curve (red line) in Hubei. The first stage is the free propagation stage, and we also give other simulation results of the basic regeneration number in the range of 3e4.6 (the second and third stages remain unchanged). The effect of transmission is significant, with the most accurate final infections being obtained only at 3.8. As for the basic regeneration number in the stage of free propagation, some scholars have proposed that it should be between (2.8,3.9) or (3.6,7.4) (Read et al., 2020) . Obviously, these expressions are either inaccurate or too wide. Fig. 4 shows the comparison chart of the average incubation period. We simulated the days in the range of 3e9 respectively, and found that when the average incubation period was set to 6 days, it could better fit the official curve, while the other simulated values are quite different from the official curves. It is also found that the shorter the incubation period, the faster the virus spreads and the greater the total number of infections.

When we use Gaussian distribution to simulate, the main influence is the average value, but the standard deviation has little influence, so we will take the best accord with the objective fact variance to simulate. The basic reproduction number is the number of people infected by a patient during the average illness period when all are susceptible at the morbidity of the disease. The Gaussian distribution function of D1 e N\u00f0x1; y1\u00de is used to represent the propagation ability of the virus. This formula indicates that a single infected person can infect \u00c21 person on average in the first stage. At this stage, \u00c21 has a value range of \u00f01; \u00fe \u221e\u00de, and a standard deviation of y1 \u00bc 1:5.",

In addition, according to the existing data abroad, we also make bold predictions of the epidemic development trends in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, pointing out the possible outbreaks and the corresponding control time, and tracing the earliest transmission dates of countries.
