The recombinant plasmid pGEX-6p-M 0 was constructed and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS for expression. SDS-PAGE analysis showed recombinant truncated M 0 protein was highly expressed by pGEX-6p-M 0 and the product fusion protein GST-M 0 reached 45% in the total bacteria proteins with the analysis of software AlphaImager2200. The preliminary purified recombinant protein was evaluated for its antigenicity and reactivity through Western blotting and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with monoclonal antibody against M protein of PEDV and porcine polyclonal anti-PEDV antiserum as the primary antibody. The results indicated the recombinant truncated M 0 protein should be candidate as a feasible recombinant diagnostic reagent. #",

Since PED was first reported in England in 1971 (Wood, 1977) . It has become one of the severe viral diarrhea diseases that lead to serious economic losses in swine-raising countries (Debouck et al., 1982; Hofmann and Wyler, 1987) . Although some currently established methods for serodiagnosis of PED virus infection had been reported, most of all their detecting reagents are all prepared with virus antigen from PED virus infected Vero cells or intestine and fecal samples of experimentally infected sows (Jin et al., 2004 (Jin et al., , 2005 Rodak et al., 2005) . However, the narrow infection spectrum and the lower cell infection titre of PED virus limited the yield in laboratory, and the clinical application of PED whole virus antigen presents potential risk. Hence, it is very necessary and important to develop www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 123 (2007) [187] [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] effective diagnostic reagents for preventing and control of this disease.",

The envelope contains three main viral proteins, spike (S, 180-220 kDa), membrane (M, 27-32 kDa) and small membrane(sM, 7 kDa) (Locker et al., 1992; Sang-Geon et al., 2003) . The M protein is the most abundant of three, it is a triple-spanning membrane protein with a short amino-terminal domain on the outside of the virus (the exterior of the viral envelope) and a long carboxyterminal domain on the inside (Utiger et al., 1995a) . Except playing an important role in the assembly process of viral nucleocapsid and membrane, M can neutralize anti-M antibody with the presence of complement (Rottier, 1995; de Haan et al., 1998) . In order to obtain and assess the recombinant M protein used for a diagnostic reagent of PED (Woods et al., 1987; Guscetti et al., 1998) , in this study, the recombinant M 0 protein (rMP) containing only the exterior of the viral envelope of M has been highly expressed and identified after preliminary purified.",

In 1995, Eukaryotic expression system (e.g., baculovirus) had been evaluated to express PEDV M protein, but the expression level is very low (Utiger et al., 1995b) . Although the full length M protein may be considered an ideal antigen to use in diagnosis, the poor-level of expression of it limited the potential production and application in future. In order to improve the expression level and avoid the possible sprout function of it, we take two strategies, firstly we truncated the M gene by primers design, to obtain the N terminal gene fragment encoding the approximate 4.4 kDa envelope exterior of the M protein, and for McAb + GST and plot b2 for culture supernatant of SP2/0 meyloma cell + GST) optical density (OD) readings were plotted for each dilution. The assay was carried out in duplicate for each antigen. secondly, we made use of the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1, which can combine 26 kDa fusion protein GST as the vector of truncated M 0 protein antigenic determinant. After induction conditions optimized, the expected high-level expression result was obtained (Fig. 1, lane 3) and as we expected, the expression product was accumulated in the form of IBs in E. coli cytosol, therefore, the extraction process of IBs was carried out expediently. After the preliminary size-exclusion chromatography purification, the pooled purified rMP was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis and identified using McAb against PEDV M protein by western blotting and indirect ELISA. Especially, the practical use of rMP antigen was evaluated by authentic positive porcine polyclonal anti-PEDV serum and negative serum control (Fig. 4) . The assays results showed that antigenicity of rMP was not only very close to its native viral proteins' but also determined by linear antigenic determinant of truncated M 0 protein, hence, the suspicion that the antigenic integrity of the small target M 0 protein fragment may partly affected by a big fusion protein GST among a single recombinant protein was eliminated.",

Briefly, compared with S, N proteins of PEDV in theory, we found M protein to be superior as a diagnostic antigen. The M protein accounts for a considerable proportion in envelope components of PEDV particles and the exterior of envelope of M is more stable than that of S, especially, in the process of whole virus antigen extraction treatment. Hence, based on whole viral particles as diagnostic reagent, it would be more reliable making use of M protein as diagnostic antigen in serology diagnosis; N protein located inside of envelope of virus particles, to expose it outside is the first necessary step before making use of it as a diagnostic antigen, by comparison, the envelope exterior of M protein originally exposes outside.
