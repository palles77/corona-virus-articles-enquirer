In this study, effect of rotavirus infection on cell cycle machinery was explored. We found that rotavirus (RV) infection in MA104 cells induces the expression of cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases and down-regulates expression of CDK inhibitors, resulting in G1 to S phase transition. The rotavirus induced S phase accumulation was found to be concurrent with induction in expression of calmodulin and activation of CaMKI which is reported as inducer of G1-S phase transition. This cell cycle manipulation was found to be Ca \u00fe 2 /Calmodulin pathway dependent. The physiological relevance of G1 to S phase transition was established when viral gene expressions as well as viral titers were found to be increased in S phase synchronized cells and decreased in G0/G1 phase synchronized cells compared to unsynchronized cells during rotavirus infection.",

            "text": "Manipulating the cell cycle machinery in order to sustain their own replication is a common mechanism employed by different viruses (Emmett et al., 2005) . Among the three check points of cell cycle at G 1 /S, G 2 /M and the metaphase/anaphase boundary, G 1 /S is the time window where cell decides for growth or quiescence depending on environmental conditions (Bartek and Lukas, 2001) . During the hours preceding the G 1 phase, Retinoblastoma (Rb) remains in hypo phosphorylated form, which can bind and inhibit a group of transcription factors (like E2F) responsible for transcribing genes required for replication as well as cell cycle progression (Giacinti and Giordano, 2006) . When cell gets stimuli essential for the G 1 to S phase transition, Rb becomes hyperphosphorylated and loses ability to bind and inhibit E2F, which then translocates to nucleus and induces expression of genes like thymidine kinase, thymidine synthetase, dihydrofolate reductase, cyclins and CDKs required for G1 to S phase transition (Harbour and Dean, 2000; Fan and Bertino, 1997) . Ca \u00fe 2 /CaM-stimulated proteins, including the family of multifunctional Ca \u00fe 2 /CaM-stimulated protein kinases (CaMK), have been identified as one of the important mediators among several stimuli that induce cell cycle progression (Kahl and Means, 2003) . CaMKI induces Rb phosphorylation and cyclin D1 upregulation and CDK 4 activation for overall G1 to S phase transition (Skelding et al., 2011) .",

DNA viruses are extensively studied for cell cycle manipulation as primary site of their replication is in the nucleus. To support viral replication small DNA viruses lacking their own polymerase, such as simian virus 40 (DeCaprio et al., 1988; Fanning and Knippers, 1992) , human papillomavirus (Werness et al., 1990) and adenovirus (Eckner et al., 1994; Howe et al., 1990) promote cell cycle progression to S phase. To avoid competition with host for replication machinery large DNA viruses (herpes viruses) arrest cell cycle in the G 0 /G 1 phase (Flemington, 2001) . Retroviruses such as HIV type 1 arrests cell cycle in G 2 /M phase by employing Vpr protein for proper viral gene expression (Goh et al., 1998; He et al., 1995) . Single stranded RNA viruses, whose primary site of replication is cytoplasm were also been found to affect host cell cycle either inducing G 2 /M phase arrest (infectious bronchitis virus) (Dove et al., 2006) or G 0 /G 1 arrest (murine corona virus, Influenza virus) (Chen and Makino, 2004; He et al., 2010) , however whether self-limiting double stranded RNA viruses like RV manipulates cell cycle remains largely unknown.",

Cells were then treated with propidium iodide (50 mg/ml) and cell cycle status was analyzed using flowcytometry as described in material and methods. As shown in Fig. 1A significant accumulation (20-32%) of infected cells in S phase was observed during early time point of infection (2-6 hpi), compared to mock infected cells (10-11%) in a strain independent manner. Whereas at 8 hpi number of cells in S phase was not significantly higher (14-16%) in case of all the three strains, compared to uninfected controls (10-11%) and at later time points (10-12 hpi) no of cells started to increase in sub G 0 phase compared to uninfected control (Fig. 1A) . To confirm the direct effect of RV on host cell cycle machinery, MA104 cells were synchronized in G 1 phase by serum starvation and were infected with SA11 at 3 moi or kept mock infected followed by cell cycle analysis using flowcytometry.

In addition to nuclear translocation, expression of E2F gene was also induced during RV infection as assessed by immunoblotting and real time PCR (Fig. 2B ). Functionality of increased nuclear translocation of E2F was further validated by assessing expression of different E2F regulated genes such as thymidine kinase, thymidine synthase and dihydrofolate reductase in SA11 infected MA104 cells by quantitative RT-PCR.

Cyclin E1 and CDK2 transcripts were induced as early as 2 hpi but significant increase in protein level were observed at 4-6 hpi ( Fig. 3A and B ). As expression of both CDK and Cyclin increased during infection, kinase activity of CDK4, CDK6 and CDK2 was evaluated by immunoprecipitating cyclin-CDK complexes from SA11 (3 moi) infected and mock infected cells. The kinase activity of cyclin-CDK complex was measured by incubating (30 min at 37 1C) them with specific substrates such as Rb for CDK4, CDK6 and Histone H1 for CDK2 in vitro in specific kinase buffer followed by immunoblotting with pRb and pHistone H1 specific antibody. Increases in activity were observed for CDK4, CDK6 during early infection (2-6 hpi) whereas CDK2 was transiently activated only at 4-6 hpi ( Fig. 3C ).

In a previous study from our group, CaM level was found to be modulated during RV infection (Weinberg, 1995) . To know the activation level of CaMKI during RV infection, MA104 cells were infected with the RV SA11 strain (at a moi of 3) and incubated for 0-8 hpi. Cell extracts were immunoblotted with phospho CaMKI and CaM specific antibody. Results indicated increased phosphorylation (activation) of CaMKI along with upregulation of CaM expression during initial time points of infection (2-6 h), followed by decrease at 8 hpi (Fig. 4A ). To delineate relation between CaMKI activation and cell cycle progression, MA104 cells were either infected with RV SA11 strain at 3 moi or kept mock infected in presence or absence of either calcium chelator BAPTA-AM which chelates Ca \u00fe 2 ions and inhibits CaM activation or CaM inhibitor W7 which bind selectively to CaM and inhibit its downstream functions (Dhillon et al., 2003) , for indicated time points followed by cell cycle analysis using flowcytometry (treatments were done post viral absorption). Quantitive analysis revealed that both BAPTA-AM and W7 inhibit cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase as found in only SA11 infected MA104 cells (Fig. 4B) . Inhibition of CAMKI activation by using BAPTA-AM and W7 was proved by immunoblotting the cell extracts of SA11 infected or mock infected MA104 cells treated with BAPTA-AM and W7 with phospho CaMKI specific antibody (Fig. 4C) . To define the mechanism behind Ca \u00fe 2 /CaM activated CaMKI mediated cell cycle manipulation, we assessed the levels of Rb phosphorylation and E2F translocation to nucleus during SA11 infection in presence or absence of BAPTA-AM or W7 treatment. Both BAPTA-AM and W7 significantly minimized Rb phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of E2F compared to only virus infected cells (Fig. 5A) .

But in case of CKIs, following RV infection, expression of p21 and p27 was downregulated both in presence (Fig. 5B) or absence (Fig. 3D ) of BAPTA-AM and W7 suggesting that CKI regulation is Ca \u00fe 2 /CaM independent.",

Result revealed in G 0 /G 1 synchronized cells, viral gene expression was significantly low compared to unsynchronized cells but it was significantly higher in S phase synchronized cells ( Fig. 6A and B) . Furthermore, viral titers were measured by plaque assay in unsynchronized MA104 cells or cells synchronized at G 0 /G 1 phase or at S phase following infection with SA11 strains at 1 moi. Compared to cells synchronized at G 0 /G 1 phase significantly higher viral titers were observed in cells synchronized at S phase or unsynchronized cells (Fig. 6C) .

To ensure correct cell division in higher eukaryotes, cell cycle is intricately controlled by numerous complex mechanisms (Schafer, 1998) , which in turn are manipulated by many viruses to favor their replication (Emmett et al., 2005) . In our current study we found RV also influences cell cycle status of infected cells by propelling them from G 1 to S phase in a strain independent manner (Fig. 1A) . Replication of RV is important for cell cycle manipulation as UV inactivated viruses could not drive G 1 to S phase transition (Fig. 1A) as well as level and activity manipulation of cell cycle machinery proteins (data not shown).",

D type cyclins (Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3) preferably binds and activates CDK4 and CDK6 to hyper phosphorylate Rb and free the E2F protein to induce the expression of cyclin E1 and CDK2 which after forming the holoenzyme retains the hyper phosphorylated state of the Rb molecule (Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009 ). Concurrent to Rb phosphorylation pattern, all the CDKs involved in G 1 to S phase transition were activated during early hours of infection (Fig. 3C) . Formation of active cyclin-CDK complex depends on expression level of Cyclins and CDKs (Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009) , manipulation of which might be one of the mechanisms employed by viruses to activate CDK complex. As speculated up-regulation of all the cyclins and CDKs was observed at both transcript or protein levels during early infections ( Fig. 3A and B ). Other than the expression level of cyclins and CDKs which is essential for formation of the holo enzyme, CKIs play an important regulatory role to control CDK activation. There are two families of CKIs, CIP/KIP and INK4 family. The CIP/KIP family of proteins includes p21, p27 and p57, which are specific inhibitors of kinase activity of all type of CDKs; by contrast compounds of the INK4 family (p15, p16, p18, p19) prevent the association as well as function of only CDK4, CDK6 and D type cyclins (Besson et al., 2008) . During RV infection, in addition to up-regulation of cyclins and CDKs, members of CKIs were significantly down-regulated at both transcript and protein levels, which may have additive effect on CDK activation ( Fig. 3D  and E) . The level of change in transcript and protein levels of cyclins, CDKs or CKIs did not correlate exactly at all time points (Fig. 3A, B , D, and E) which could be due to inhibition of translation of cellular proteins by different mechanisms (like inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport) (Rubio et al., 2013; Padilla-Noriega et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Modulation of Ca \u00fe 2 signals at various stages of the cell cycle and its role in cell cycle progression has been reported (Berridge et al., 2000) and Ca \u00fe 2 concentrations was found to be increased during RV infection (Brunet et al., 2000) . Versatile and complex Ca \u00fe 2 signaling activates different Ca \u00fe 2 binding proteins which then further modulate distinct cellular responses (Machaca, 2010) . CaM is one of the important downstream effectors of Ca \u00fe 2 which gets activated after binding Ca \u00fe 2 (Chin and Means, 2000) and its expression levels have been linked to cell cycle progression both experimentally and physiologically (Choi and Husain, 2006) . CaM expression is significantly increased during the G1-S transition (Chafouleas et al., 1982; Chafouleas et al., 1984) . Increased expression of CaM during early hours (2-6 hpi) of RV infection has been observed in differential proteomics study by our group (Weinberg, 1995) . CaM has been shown to activate several family of proteins namely serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin, multifunctional Ca 2 \u00fe /CaM-dependent protein kinases, adenyl cyclises, ion channels, phosphodiesterases, myosin light chain kinases and protein phosphatises (Chin and Means, 2000) of which Ca 2 \u00fe /CaM-dependent protein kinases have been shown to modulate cell cycle (Skelding et al., 2011) . CaMKI has been shown to induce G 1 to S phase transition (Skelding et al., 2011) , concurrently activation of CaMKI (phospho CaMKI) was also observed during early RV infection (2-6 hpi) which correlated with increased CaM expression and accumulation of cells in S phase (Fig. 4A) . Significance of Ca \u00fe 2 / CaM signaling in modulation of cell cycle during RV infection was Fig. 6 . Synchronization of cells at S phase assist RV replication while synchronization of cells at G0/G1 phase hampers it. (A) MA104 cells either synchronized in S (treated with AZT) phase or in G 0 /G 1 phase (treated with terfenadine) or left unsynchronised were infected with SA11 for 2-8 hpi and total RNA was isolated and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR for viral gene expression and compared with SA11 infected unsynchronized cells. Fold changes of transcripts were obtained by normalizing relative gene expression (with respect to SA11 infected untreated cells) to GAPDH using the formula 2 \u00c0 \u0394\u0394CT (\u0394\u0394CT \u00bc\u0394C T Sample \u00c0 \u0394C T Untreated control ). Results are representative (mean7 SD) of three independent experiments. (B) MA104 cells either synchronized in S (treated with AZT) phase or in G0/G1 phase (treated with terfenadine) or left unsynchronized were infected with SA11 for 28 hpi. Total lysates were subjected to westernblot analysis for viral gene expression (NSP3). (C) MA104 cells either synchronized either in S (treated with AZT) phase or in G0/G1 phase (treated with terfenadine) or left unsynchronized were infected for 12 hpi, 18 hpi, 24 hpi followed by Plaque assay. Viral titers were measured as plaque forming units [log (pfu/ml)]. Results are representative (mean 7 SD) of three independent experiments. confirmed when Ca \u00fe 2 chelator (BAPTA-AM) and CaM inhibitor (W7) inhibited G1 to S phase transition (Fig. 4B) . Rb phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of E2F was also inhibited in presence of BAPTA-AM or W7 (Fig. 5A ). Similar to Rb phosphorylation, expression levels of cyclins, CDKs were not modulated in presence of BAPTA-AM or W7 during RV infection (Fig. 5B) , however the CKIs namely p21 and p27 were down regulated both in presence (Fig. 5B) or absence (Fig. 3D ) of BAPTA-AM or W7. Down regulation of P21 and p27 is probably regulated by p53 which has been shown to be downregulated during early hours of RV infection (Bhowmick et al., 2013) . Overall results suggest role of Ca \u00fe 2 /CaM signaling in RV induced G1 to S phase transition. Ca \u00fe 2 /CaM signaling is also important for RV replication as in presence of BAPTA-AM or W7 reduced viral titers were observed P\u00e9rez et al., 1998) .",

AZT inhibits DNA replication by inhibiting thymidine kinase and preventing deoxythymidine triphosphate formation as a result it synchronizes cells at S phase (Chandrasekaran et al., 1995) whereas terfenadine prevents Rb phosphorylation and induce the level of CKIs to prevent cell cycle progression and synchronizes cells at G 0 /G 1 phase (Liu et al., 2003) . In RV infected S phase synchronized cells, increased viral gene expression and viral titers were observed whereas cells blocked in G 0 /G 1 phase had reduced viral gene expression and titers compared to unsynchronized cells infected with SA11 confirming that RV induces G 1 to S phase transition for enhanced viral replication.",

Increase of cells in S phase during initial stages of infection was found to be beneficial for viral life cycle, which may be due to either stabilization of MT network during S phase which is helpful for viroplasm translocation (Eichwald et al., 2012) or increase in host replication proteins such as topo-isomerase during S phase which may assist in rotaviral replication as reported in case of ebola virus infection (Takahashi et al., 2013) . It is also possible that S phase accumulation provides an anti-apoptotic environment for proper completion of viral replication cycle.",
