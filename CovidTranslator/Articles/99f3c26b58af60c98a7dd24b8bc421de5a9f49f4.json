However, infusion of plasma from recovered patients showed high efficiency in elimination of this virus. Our findings might shed light on the management of COVID-19.",

These clues together indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Case 1 and Case 2 may be a mild subtype, both to young and to old people. Tang et al. investigated the molecular divergence of SARS-CoV-2, showing the virus evolved into two major types (namely L subtype and S subtype) 12 . Of which L type is more prevalent consisting of approximately 70% in all patients and S type is the ancestral version. In addition, L type has a high frequency in patients and presents more likely to spread comparing with S type 12 . Currently, few studies focused on identifying the clinical features between these two subtypes, thus we cannot assure that Case 1-associated virus belongs to S type, mutated L type or a new subtype.",

The status of lymphocytes and duration of viral shedding are two most common indicators in predicting prognosis of COVID-19 patients. However, it is still unclear which one of them is more reliable and more efficient. In the present study, IgG antibody can be detected in Case 1 from Feb. 20, indicating Case 1 can initiate immune responses to viral infection. However, the mRNA level of virus in Case 1 showed a similar trend to that of death cases. Taken together, these findings indicated that immune indicators could be more sensitive and reliable than viral shedding in reflecting the overall status of patients and predicting the prognosis. Actually, a recent study found that recruitment of T cells and the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies can be found before the resolution of symptoms in COVID-19 patients 13 . Therefore, we strongly suggest that immune indicators, especially the level of lymphocytes, could be a better prognostic indicator than duration of viral shedding, especially for patients in early stage.",
