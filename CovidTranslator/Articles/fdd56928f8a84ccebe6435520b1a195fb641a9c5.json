High proviral load is one major risk factor for disease development. HTLV-1 encodes Tax oncoprotein, which activates transcription from viral long terminal repeats (LTR) and various types of cellular promoters. Counteracting Tax function might have prophylactic and therapeutic benefits. In this work, we report on the suppression of Tax activation of HTLV-1 LTR by SIRT1 deacetylase. The transcriptional activity of Tax on the LTR was largely ablated when SIRT1 was overexpressed, but Tax activation of NF-B was unaffected. On the contrary, the activation of the LTR by Tax was boosted when SIRT1 was depleted.",

The activation of SIRT1 in HTLV-1-transformed T cells by resveratrol potently inhibited HTLV-1 proviral transcription and Tax expression, whereas compromising SIRT1 by specific inhibitors augmented HTLV-1 mRNA expression. The administration of resveratrol also decreased the production of cell-free HTLV-1 virions from MT2 cells and the transmission of HTLV-1 from MT2 cells to uninfected Jurkat cells in coculture. SIRT1 associated with Tax in HTLV-1-transformed T cells. Treatment with resveratrol prevented the interaction of Tax with CREB and the recruitment of CREB, CRTC1, and p300 to Tax-responsive elements in the LTR. Our work demonstrates the negative regulatory function of SIRT1 in Tax activation of HTLV-1 transcription. Small-molecule activators of SIRT1 such as resveratrol might be considered new prophylactic and therapeutic agents in HTLV-1-associated diseases.",

Suppressing HTLV-1 gene expression might have preventive and therapeutic benefits. It is therefore critical that host factors controlling HTLV-1 gene expression be identified and characterized. This work reveals a new host factor that suppresses HTLV-1 gene expression and a natural compound that activates this suppression. Our findings not only provide new knowledge of the host control of HTLV-1 gene expression but also suggest a new strategy of using natural compounds for prevention and treatment of HTLV-1-associated diseases.",

Once developed, ATL is highly aggressive and poorly treatable (1) . HTLV-1 also causes a chronic disabling neurological disorder termed tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) in another 1% of the infected population (2) . Treatment options for TSP are also limited. Worse still, vaccines and other prophylactic measures that can prevent ATL or TSP development in HTLV-1 carriers are not available. Although ATL or TSP development is a long process involving multiple viral, host, and environmental factors, high HTLV-1 proviral load has been singled out as one major risk factor (3) .",

This reaction is the reverse of acetylation catalyzed by histone and transcription factor acetyltransferases, such as CBP and p300. In response to metabolic signals and stress, SIRT1 can positively and negatively regulate transcription by modifying its substrate proteins (20) . In addition to having a function in healthy aging, SIRT1 has been implicated in metabolism, stress response, cancer, diabetes, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (18) . SIRT1 can deacetylate transcription factors, such as NF-B, p53, E2F1, and CREB, as well as transcriptional coactivators, such as p300 and CRTCs (18) . Particularly, the activity of CREB and CRTCs is compromised when they are deacetylated by SIRT1 (21) (22) (23) .

To explore this possibility, we performed coimmunoprecipitation in HEK293T cells overexpressing Tax and Flagtagged SIRT1. The presence of both Tax and SIRT1 in the anti-Flag precipitate obtained from cells expressing both proteins (Fig. 5A, compare lane 3 to lanes 1 and 2) indicated the association of the two entities in these cells. The catalytically inactive HY mutant of SIRT1 retained the ability to associate with Tax, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 5A, compare lane 4 to lane 3) . To extend our analysis to endogenous proteins in HTLV-1-transformed T cells, similar experiments were also done with MT2, MT4, and C8166 cells. Endogenous SIRT1 was detected in the anti-Tax precipitate obtained from extracts of MT2, MT4, and C8166 cells (Fig. 5B,  compare lanes 3 to 5 to lanes 1 and 2) . The SIRT1 band in the MT2 precipitate was less prominent, probably due to the smaller amount of Tax recovered (Fig. 5B, compare lane 3 to lanes 4 and  5) . Nevertheless, our results demonstrated the association of Tax and SIRT1 in HTLV-1-transformed T cells.",

We went on to show a SIRT1-dependent repression of HTLV-1 proviral gene transcription, virion production, and cell-to-cell transmission by resveratrol, a small-molecule agonist of SIRT1. Mechanistically, SIRT1 interacts with Tax and prevents Tax from interacting with CREB, resulting in decreased recruitment of CREB, CRTC1, and p300 to the LTR. Our work reveals the interplay between SIRT1 and Tax and thereby provides a new regulatory mechanism in HTLV-1 transcription, a control step in disease development.

            "text": "The suppression of HTLV-1 transcription by SIRT1 was supported by results from both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments conducted with HTLV-1-transformed T cells. Importantly, our analysis of the catalytically dead mutant of SIRT1 indicated the requirement of SIRT1 deacetylase activity for the suppression of HTLV-1 transcription. The deacetylase-dead mutant of SIRT1 can still interact with Tax but loses its ability to impede the interaction of Tax with CREB or to suppress Tax activation of the LTR. Thus, for the suppression of LTR activation, the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 is more important than the interaction between SIRT1 and Tax, which might be required but is not sufficient. The perturbation of the Tax-CREB interaction and the inhibition of the recruitment of CREB, CRTC1 and p300 to the LTR are two functional consequences of the action of SIRT1 deacetylase. Our findings are generally consistent with the model for SIRT1-mediated transcriptional regulation (18) (19) (20) , and they for 24 h, MT2 cells were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. CREB-, CRTC1-, or p300-bound DNA complex was immunoprecipitated using anti-CREB (A), anti-CRTC1 (B), or anti-p300 (C). The Tax-responsive sequence was PCR amplified. Relative recruitments in the irrelevant IgG precipitate were taken as basal values.

In this study, we clarified that acetylation of Tax at K346 does not affect LTR activation and might be irrelevant to the suppressive effect of resveratrol on HTLV-1 transcription. We also demonstrated that SIRT1 has no influence on Tax activation of NF-B. The suppressive effect of SIRT1 and resveratrol is therefore highly specific to HTLV-1 LTR. Although direct deacetylation of Tax by SIRT1 cannot be excluded, it would not be surprising if SIRT1 could act on multiple substrates relevant to Tax activity and HTLV-1 transcription. Thus, how SIRT1 affects deacetylation and the functions of histones, CREB, CRTCs, and other transcriptional regulators in the context of HTLV-1 infection merits further investigations. Particularly, it is intriguing to see exactly how SIRT1 impedes the interaction of Tax with CREB.",

In view of the potential of repurposing resveratrol for ATL, we characterized its inhibitory effect on Tax activity, HTLV-1 transcription, and virion production. Particularly, the negative impact of resveratrol on Tax-CREB interaction and on the LTR occupancy of CREB, CRTC1, and p300 was documented. These and further analyses along this line will elucidate the mechanism of action of resveratrol in the context of HTLV-1 transcription and transformation. A detailed comparison of resveratrol with other anti-HTLV-1 agents, such as interferon alpha and zidovudine, which have been used clinically in ATL (46) , might fully establish the utility of resveratrol for ATL and other HTLV-1-associated diseases, such as TSP.",

Particularly, second-and third-generation SIRT1-activating compounds such as SRT1720 and STAC-5 are available (25) . Compared to resveratrol, these synthetic SIRT1 activators offer greater potency, enhanced solubility, and improved bioavailability (25, 50) .
