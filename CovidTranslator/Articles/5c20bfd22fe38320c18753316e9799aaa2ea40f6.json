However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the acute disease are still not well understood. Here, we examine the role of Th17 response in the development of the acute hepatitis following infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). We show that IL-17 levels in serum are rapidly elevated and positively correlated to liver damage and death of the mice. In IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice, Th17 response is enhanced and the elevated IL-17 production contributes to severe liver damage as well as detrimental inflammation because neutralization of IL-17 effectively suppresses inflammation and protects mice from liver injury. We further show that IFN-\u03b3 facilitates antigeninduced apoptosis of Th17 cells and adoptive transferred IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 , but not IFN-\u03b3R +/+ ; CD4 + T cells promotes an enhanced liver damage in wild-type mice. The results demonstrate an essential role of Th17 cells in MHVinduced immunopathology and the importance of IFN-\u03b3 in maintaining immune balance between Th1 and Th17 responses during acute viral infection.",

Effector T cells are critical for the defense against pathogens, but inappropriate or poorly regulated T cell responses also induce inflammatory disorders and pathological damage. Thus, T cell response is stringently controlled under physiological conditions. Notably, IFN-\u03b3 is an effector cytokine produced by Th1 cells and CD8 T cells and plays a critical role in immune responses to microbial infection. IFN-\u03b3 also plays an essential role in the homeostatic control of effector T cells in order to minimize immunopathology [3, 4] . There is a progressive expansion of T cells in IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with mycobacteria [5] . After Listeria infection, the frequency of antigenspecific T cells is higher in IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice than in wild-type mice [6] . Severe T cell-mediated immunopathology is observed in IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice infected by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [7] . Failure to suppress the expansion of the activated T cells in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 pathway leads to more severe encephalitis in mice [8] . Similarly, IFN-\u03b3 or its receptor deficient mice exhibit an increased susceptibility to MHV-induced hepatitis [9] [10] [11] . It has been hypothesized that the increased susceptibility is due to uncontrolled response to virus infection. However, the molecular and cellular basis underlying the impaired responses is largely unknown.",

Although IL-17 was initially identified as a pathogenic cytokine in autoimmunity [12] [13] [14] [15] , increasing evidence suggests that IL-17 also plays a critical role in controlling microbial infection, especially intracellular bacterial infection [16] [17] [18] . IL-17 promotes recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection, inducing proliferation of enterocytes and production of antibacterial defensins [19, 20] . Indeed, IL-17 is known to be induced and required for the host protection against Klebsiella pneumoniae [21] , Citrobacter rodentium [22] , and Candida albicans [23] . Hence, Th17 cells are an integral part of an antibacterial immunity. In contrast, the role of Th17 cells in viral infection is less clear. Previous studies indicate that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection results in depletion of Th17 cells in the ileal mucosa [24] . Similarly, IL-17 is negatively regulated by Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 [25] . Th17 cells are suggested to correlate with the severity of liver damage during chronic HBV infection [26] . These previous studies suggest possible connections between IL-17 and virus infection.",

In contrast, IL-17 neutralization affected little on the viral load (data not shown).

An increased influx of Gr1 + neutrophilic granulocytes was observed in IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 liver 5 dpi (Fig. 4c) , which is consistent with the previous report that IL-17 mediates recruitment, activation and proliferation of neutrophils [31] . Importantly, neutralization of IL-17 greatly reduced the level of these inflammatory mediators (Fig. 4d) .

The frequency of Th17 cells in the wild-type mice increased following the infection, but the increase was much more dramatic in IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice with the highest level at 5 dpi ( Fig. 5a; Table 1 ). Similarly, the frequencies of Th17 cells in the liver were also significantly higher in IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice (5.15\u00b10.56%) than in wild-type mice (1.74\u00b10.08%) 5 dpi (Fig. 5b) . We also determined the frequencies and numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) at and wild-type mice (closed bar) were bled 0, 3, and 5 dpi, and levels of cytokines in serum were quantified by CBA mouse inflammation kit (BD). In general, the inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1, were obviously increased in IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with wild-type controls. b Livers of IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 (open bar) and wild-type mice (closed bar) were collected at indicated time points, and levels of cytokines in local livers were quantified by CBA mouse inflammation kit (BD). Consistent with that in serum, the inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated in the infected livers of IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice. c Hepatic lymphocytes were isolated 5 dpi and stained with PE-conjugated Abs against Gr1. The frequencies of Gr1 + cells in liver were measured by FACS. d Systemic IL-17 neutralization was performed in IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice as mentioned above. Livers of these mice with (closed bar) or without IL-17 neutralization (open bar) were collected 5 dpi, and levels of local cytokines were quantified by CBA mouse inflammation kit (BD). Systemic treatment with Abs against IL-17 significantly reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1 different time points post infection. However, no significant difference was observed in splenic Tregs between IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice (Fig.S5) .

            "text": "To investigate how IFN-\u03b3 controlled the virus-induced Th17 response, we determined whether IFN-\u03b3 had a direct effect on IL-17 producing CD4 + cells. CD4 + T cells from IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mice were purified and differentiated into Th17 cells by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in the presence of TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 for 4 days [32, 33] . Flow cytometry analysis showed that Th17 cells from wild-type mice, but not IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice, expressed IFN-\u03b3R (Fig. 6a) . Because IFN-\u03b3 was known to induce apoptosis of activated T cells [3, 4, 34, 35] , we analyzed whether IFN-\u03b3 might have a direct role in inducing apoptosis of Th17 cells. Thus, OVAspecific Th17 cells were generated from DO11.10 transgenic CD4 + T cells by stimulation with OVA peptide for 5 days. Following OVA stimulation, a large fraction of Th17 cells differentiated and then underwent apoptosis. Addition of IFN-\u03b3 increased their apoptosis (Fig. 6b) . Neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 slightly decreased Th17 cells apoptosis (Fig. 6b) . Because little IFN-\u03b3 was secreted by Th17 cells, IFN-\u03b3induced apoptosis of Th17 cells may happen through a paracrine effect. The ex vivo experiment showed that there was more apoptosis of Th17 cells in wild-type mice than that in IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6c) . These results suggest that IFN\u03b3 could restrict Th17 cell expansion by inducing their apoptosis, and the dysfunction of this pathway is probably responsible for the exacerbated Th17 induction during MHV-A59 infection in IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Mortality without supportive management and/or liver transplantation is over 70%, especially in children. The disease is characterized by massive hepatic necrosis associated with failure of hepatic regeneration. Using the model of MHV-A59-induced fulminant hepatitis Fig. 5a , the frequencies of IL-17-expressing CD4 + T cells in total CD4 + T cells of liver were determined by FACS HIV-specific Th17 cells are detectable especially in early infection, suggesting that Th17 cells may exert in acute viral infection [36] . In addition, IL-17R signaling modulates the host response to herpes simplex virus corneal infection at early time-points post infection, actively promoting corneal inflammation [37] . Respiratory syncytial virus infection in the absence of STAT1 results in augmented IL-17 levels as well as enhanced airway dysfunction [38] . Mice lacking both of the transcription factors T-bet and eomesodermin develop high levels of IL-17-secreting CD8 + T cells following LCMV infection, leading to a progressive inflammatory and wasting syndrome [39] . Th17 cells also contributed to the liver damage Four days after activation, cells were restimulated with PMA/ionomycin and subjected to intracellular cytokine staining for IL-17. IFN-\u03b3R expression on Th17 cells was detected by staining with a PE-labeled Ab against CD119 (black line). A PE-labeled isotype-matched Ab was used as a control (filled). b Sorted CD4 + T cells from Do11.10 mice were stimulated with or without OVA peptide in presence of 20 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-6 and 3 ng/ml human TGF-\u03b2 plus recombinant mouse IL-2. 50 ng/ml mouse recombinant IFN-\u03b3 or 10 \u03bcg/ml neutralizing rat Abs R46A2 (anti-IFN-\u03b3) was applied as indicated 1 day post stimulation. Five days later, cells were restimulated with PMA/ionomycin and subjected to intracellular cytokine staining for IL-17. Apoptosis of Th17 cells was determined by FITC-labeled TUNEL staining. A FITC-labeled isotype-matched Ab was used as a control. Ratios of apoptotic to nonapoptotic Th17 cells were statistically analyzed. c Hepatic lymphocytes were isolated from MHV-A59 infected IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice (open bar) and wild-type mice (closed bar) at different time points post infection. After stimulation with PMA/ionomycin, cells were subjected for IL-17 staining and TUNEL assay. Apoptosis of Th17 cells was determined by FITClabeled TUNEL staining as described above. Ratios of apoptotic Th17 cells were statistically analyzed during chronic HBV infection [26] . Therefore, it is conceivable that Th17 cells could cause pathogenesis in addition to the protective property in many viral infections [40] . Consistently, in our study MHV-A59-induced Th17 cells contribute to detrimental inflammation and liver disease, implying the involvement of Th17 cells in fulminant viral hepatitis in clinical settings. In particular, MHV-A59 infection drives exacerbated Th17 response in IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice, correlating with prolonged viral persistence. This may be mediated by inhibition of T cell cytotoxicity by IL-17, permitting sustained viral infection, similar to what has been observed in the pathogenesis of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease [41] .",

In addition, innate anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF\u03b2 elicited by HCV suppress Ag-specific Th17 cells [43] . Notably, immunity to viruses is ascribed to Th1 responses whose production of IFN-\u03b3 could antagonize Th17 cells [44, 45] .

IL-17 neutralization significantly delayed death of IFN\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice, although it had little effect on the death of wild-type mice. This suggests a stringent restriction of Th17 cells during viral infection in wild-type mice.",

The enhanced Th17 response in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 stimulates inflammation and therefore, severe liver damage. This finding may shed light on the pathogenesis of acute viral infection, especially fulminant viral hepatitis, in clinical settings. The notion that IFN-\u03b3 modulates pathogenic Th17 response during viral infection may help to develop new diagnosis and therapy for virusinduced inflammatory diseases.",
