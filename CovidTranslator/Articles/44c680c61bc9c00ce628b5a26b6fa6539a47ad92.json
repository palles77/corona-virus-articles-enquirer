One of main challenges facing its medical care is the lack of effective tools for selecting patients posing a high risk of mortality at an early stage. Previous studies have explored risk factors associated with severity levels of the pneumonia. For example, Zhou et.al 2 identified that the older age and a high level of D-dimer are associated with in-hospital death, while Shi et.al 3 found that the manifestation of chest CT imaging abnormalities correlates with disease states. However, the joint analysis of time and progression event, as well as the integration of multiple types of input data into risk prediction, have not been thoroughly investigated.",

The independent predisposition factors of progression include old age, high BMI, fever, and co-existing hypertension or diabetes diseases. However, using age as a single prognostic factor could lead to erroneous results since young patients were not necessarily progression-free. Different from previous studies 4-6 , the severe group in this cohort has a significantly higher proportion of patients with fever symptom at admission (82.9% vs. 54.2%). Moreover, we identified, for the first time, that overweight is associated with disease severity. These findings benefit the risk assessment analysis as we showed that a model combining these indicators can substantially improve the prediction performance as compared to a model that only contains univariate predictor (mean time-dependent AUC= 0.824 versus 0.751).",

Most survival data analyses set the onset as the primary end point, and censor recovery or hospital discharge. However, when competing risks of severity onset are present, this analytical method induces bias. In this study, the risk of severe progression assessed without considering the competition would be overestimated because the patients who would never progress (those who discharged from hospital without progression) were treated as if they could progress. The extent of such bias and its adjustment by competing risks modeling have been evaluated in clinical virology and oncology research [10] [11] [12] [13] . We incorporated high-dimensional variable selection techniques into the competing risks modeling so that quantitative image features can be extensively evaluated according to their contribution to risk prediction. Our evaluation results showed that incorporating CT image can significantly improve the prediction performance as compared to those only based on demographical and clinical information (mean time-dependent AUC = 0.880 versus 0.824). In particular, such improvement was achieved with only one additional image feature, suggesting the importance of using multi-modality data in risk analysis.",

First, the laboratory testing data had not been integrated into the CT image-based model because blood sample was not collected along with imaging in the center.

Second, the occurrence of severity may depend on other factors such as treatment, viral load or genetic factors. Our model can include such additional covariates. However, the availability of well-processed data on these factors is scarce, and we have shown that the current model can have reasonable prediction performance even without considering them. Third, because of limited sample size of patients progressed to severity, we only evaluated model prediction performance by cross-validation. Further validation needs to be conducted on external datasets. Fourth, we restricted our analysis of the severe group up to the severity onset.
