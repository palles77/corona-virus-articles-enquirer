Present study describes serological distribution of bovine major respiratory viruses in non -vaccinated cattle population of Marmara region in north-western Turkey. Neutralising antibodies specific to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PI-3), bovine adenovirus serotype 1 (BAV-1) and serotype 3 (BAV-3) were investigated. Among 584 serum samples collected from 39 establishments in 7 provinces, 41.4% were positive for BVDV, 17.1% for BHV-1, 73.0% for BRSV, 43.0% for PI-3, 89.5% for BAV-1 and 92.3% for BAV-3. There were significant differences observed between seroprevalence rates detected in neighbouring provinces. Serological prevalence of BVDV, BHV-1 and BRSV were extremely higher in large capacity dairy farms than of small capacity farms (p<0.0001). This study demonstrates that herd capacity is a very important risk factor for respiratory viruses and, on the other hand bovine adenoviruses and BRSV are the common reason of respiratory diseases in the region.",

            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex is a very important health problem for cattle industry world wide. BRD impairs animal welfare, causes excessive use of antibiotics and increases the rate of death or obligatory culling in calves as well as young stock. Hence, an important economical impact on cattle production is generated. Viruses that commonly involved in BRD cases are bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PI-3), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and bovine adenoviruses (BAV). Although respiratory and faecal shedding was demonstrated (Has\u00f6ks\u00fcz et al. 2002 ) the role of bovine coronavirus (BCV) in clinical respiratory diseases is not clear and only few cases were reported to be associated with BCV (Heckert et al. 1990 ) Some other viruses like rhinoviruses, enteroviruses and reoviruses may also play a secondary role in the etiology of respiratory diseases in cattle (Stott et al. 1980) . Management and environmental conditions are highly related to bovine respiratory diseases, moreover the other infectious agents like bacteria (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus somnus and Salmonella dublin) and Mycoplasma spp. (e.g. M. bovis and M. dispar) are frequently contribute to respiratory viruses for generation of BRD (Valarcher and Haaglund 2006) .",

Small capacity farms where some of them also contained sheep and goats included less than 20 cattle, however, intensively managed herds consisted of more than 50 cows. There was no vaccination program in those of establishments applied against the viruses examined in this study. Sampled animals were Holstein-Frisian and older than 1 year old.

Fifty microlitres of diluted serum sample was mixed with an equal volume of virus suspension (100TCID 50 ) in 96well microtitre plate wells as duplicates and conse-quently incubated in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. Two hours incubation was applied for BHV-1 while it was 1 hour for the other viruses. Thereafter, MDBK cell suspension (3\u00d710 5 cells /ml) was added into each well in a volume of 50 \u03bcl. In the VNT performed for anti-BRSV antibodies, Bel-26 cell cultures were previously prepared in 96-well plates. After incubation of virus suspension with diluted serum samples in a transfer plate; cell culture medium in 96-well plates was removed and 100 \u03bcl of virus-serum mixture was inoculated onto cells as duplicates. Test results were evaluated in an inverted light microscope after 5-7 days of incubation in 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. All the viruses used in present study are in cytopathogenic nature, thus, inhibition of virus growth indicated by non-destructed monolayers of cell cultures was evaluated as indicator of virus neutralization.",

            "text": "Antibodies to bovine respiratory viruses were detected in all of 39 dairy establishments located in 7 provinces indicating bovine respiratory infections are distributed in the region. There were great variations in the prevalence values of different viruses, for example the overall prevalence of BHV-1 was 17.1% while it was 92.3% for BAV-3 (Table 1) . Statistically important differences among prevalence of individual viruses may be affected by different factors e.g virus spread and type of breeding etc. Contrary to previous studies performed in different regions in Turkey (Alkan et al. 1997; Yavru et al. 2005; Gumusova et al. 2007) , the most common respiratory viruses in north-western Turkey are adenoviruses which have a seroprevalence of 92.3% for BAV-3 and 89.5% for BAV-1. Similar results were also observed in Finland where among the evaluated herds 100% were infected with BAV-7 and 83% with BAV-1 (Hartel et al. 2004 ). The seroprevalence of BAV-3 was statistically higher than of other viruses except BAV-1 (p<0.0001). The close relationship detected between the seropositivity rates of BAV-1 and BAV-3 is possibly due to belonging to the same serological group (group I) of bovine adenoviruses ( Table 2 ). The second common virus was BRSV to which a great importance is attributed in clinical respiratory disease and pneumonia cases (Uttenthal et al. 1996; Larsen et al. 2001 ). Comparing to adenoviruses and BRSV, the other viruses (BVDV, BHV-1 and PI-3) existed a lower degree of seroprevalence in the study area (p<0.0001). PI-3 is the other common respiratory viral pathogen in many countries (Abondo et al. 1999; Fulton et al. 2000; Hartel et al. 2004; Autio et al. 2007 ). In present study, PI-3 had an antibody prevalence of 43.0% indicating a moderate distribution of this agent in Marmara region. A relationship between PI-3 and BVDV in respiratory infections was reported (Fulton et al. 2000) . Accordingly not significant difference between seroprevalence rate of PI-3 and BVDV was detected in this study.",

Because lots of our samples were obtained from privately owned and small capacity farms, a detailed survey of BHV-1 comparing large and small capacity farms in this region may be valuable.

In a previous study (submitted to publication) we detected a seroprevalence of 45.8% against BVDV-1 NADL strain and 5.8% against BVDV-2 Gi-2 strain among cattle in this region. Results of various studies are consistent that pestivirus infections are common in Marmara region of Turkey (Alkan et al. 1997; Ye\u015filba\u011f et al. in press) . Immunosuppressive effects of BVDV may accelerate the respiratory infections; moreover BVDV impairs pulmonary clearance mechanism which is a very important barrier for viral and bacterial infections (Lopez et al. 1982; Potgieter et al. 1984) There were significant differences between seroprevalence of a given virus in different provinces. That kind of differences was detected especially for BVDV and BRSV. Interestingly Bal\u0131kesir and Bursa, the neighbouring provinces, showed statistically extremely significant differences in prevalence rate of five viruses (BVDV, BHV-1, BRSV, PI-3 and BAV-1). This heterogeneity may be related to regional density of dairy establishments as well as relatedness between individual herds.",

Quadrate detection of viral antibodies was very common which was followed by triple and double combinations. Only 6 animals were negative for antibodies to all the analysed viruses while 25 animals had antibody to one virus. That situation may be described by multiagent nature of the etiology of respiratory diseases (Autio et al. 2007 ). Multiple antibody detection in an animal may be due to contribution of these viruses in a BRD case (Hagglund et al. 2006 ) meanwhile those of antibodies might be generated by individual virus infections caused in different time intervals. Detection of statistically significant differences in serological prevalence of BVDV, BHV-1 and BRSV in large capacity dairy herds indicates that herd size is an important risk factor for those of infections.",

Although respiratory diseases cause slight decrease in milk yield, as a herd health problem that kind of infections threat calves and young stock which is very important for continuation of the herd and profitability of production. Despite high prevalence of seropositive animals awaited to limit circulation of infections in the field condition, low protective efficiency of neutralizing antibodies and short duration of mucosal immunity allows repeated respiratory infections in cattle herds. Thus, protective measures like vaccination and good management practises may be beneficial in this region. This study also confirms that along with BRSV and PI-3, bovine adenoviruses are common reason of bovine respiratory diseases.",
