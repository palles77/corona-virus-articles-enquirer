CHIKV was first isolated in Tanzania in 1947 (1), but the virus has emerged rapidly over the last decade, causing outbreaks in the islands of the Indian Ocean, in Southern Europe, and in Southeast Asia (2) . In 2013, CHIKV spread to the Western Hemisphere and, by the end of 2015, had infected more than 1.8 million people in North America, Central America, and South America. The acute symptoms of CHIKV infection include fever and rash, which typically resolve within a few days, and joint and muscle pain (3) . CHIKV and other arthritogenic alphaviruses directly invade the synovium to cause inflammatory arthritis (4) , which is characterized by articular swelling and prolonged morning stiffness (3) . CHIKV-induced arthritis in humans can persist, with as many as 60% of individuals progressing to chronic disease that lasts from months to years (3, (5) (6) (7) . Epidemiological projections suggest that there are currently about 400,000 individuals in the Western Hemisphere with chronic CHIKV arthritis (8) .",

Treatment with newer disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has been effective in preventing the bone erosions and deformities seen in patients with untreated RA. Whether chronic CHIKV arthritis causes erosive disease remains controversial, although there are reports of bone erosions in patients infected with CHIKV (9) . Effective treatment of RA relies on early diagnosis, because erosions can occur within months of onset of the disease (12) . Because CHIKV and RA exhibit significant clinical overlap, there is potential for confusing the diagnoses and inadvertently treating CHIKV arthritis with DMARD therapy (3) .",

Among the newest drugs used to treat RA is tofacitinib, an oral DMARD that inhibits JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) signaling and broadly blunts cytokine responses (13, 14) . However, many DMARDs, by virtue of their immunosuppressive properties, may predispose to serious microbial infections. Thus, there is a need to determine whether DMARDs are effective, benign, or deleterious in the treatment of CHIKV arthritis. The current standard of care for CHIKV arthritis is treatment with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (15) , although these often do not ameliorate symptoms (3). One trial compared chloroquine (a DMARD) to meloxicam (an NSAID) and found no difference in efficacy (15) , although a placebo group was not included in the trial design. Another open-label study examined a combination of hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate in the treatment of CHIKV arthritis and found that some patients partially responded to therapy, although ~50% of patients did not achieve significant improvement in disease score (16) .",

To test this idea, we performed a multiarm prospective study (Fig. 1A ) by inoculating 224 4-week-old WT mice subcutaneously in the left rear foot with 10 3 focus-forming units (FFU) of a pathogenic clinical isolate of CHIKV (La Reunion, 2006) . Mice were divided into groups of 28 animals that received one of the following treatments beginning on day 3 after infection: methylprednisolone, naproxen, methotrexate, etanercept (soluble human TNF-\u03b1 receptor), CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), oral gavage vehicle control, or tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor). All of the biological agents that we used have been shown previously to have activity in mice (13, 25, 26) . We chose day 3 after infection to initiate treatment, because this represents the time point of the first peak of clinically apparent foot swelling in the WTC57BL/6 mouse model of CHIKV infection (Fig. 1B) . Animals were followed for clinical joint swelling in the ipsilateral foot and viral yield at different times after infection and treatment.",

Because persistent viral RNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern and may contribute to CHIKV arthritis (3, 28) , we tested whether anti-CHIKV mAb treatment would reduce viral RNA levels. Although we did not observe a reduction in viral RNA levels in the ipsilateral foot joints (P > 0.1), other extremity joints exhibited a ~10-fold reduction in viral RNA on day 7 after infection, including the contralateral ankle and ipsilateral wrist ( Fig. 3B ; right ankle, P < 0.005; left wrist, P < 0.05). On day 28, there was a trend toward reduced RNA in distal joint tissues of animals treated with anti-CHIKV mAb, although this did not attain statistical significance ( Fig. 3C ; P = 0.2). Collectively, these results show that treatment with an anti-CHIKV mAb (alone or in combination with CTLA4-Ig) rapidly eliminates infectious virus within 2 days and reduces but fails to clear viral RNA in affected tissues.",

Using a multiplexed assay, we measured cytokine and chemokine levels in the ipsilateral foot on day 7 after infection in animals that received either control mAb, CTLA4-Ig, anti-CHIKV mAb, or combination therapy with CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb. Monotherapy with CTLA4-Ig reduced levels of CXCL10 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (MIP-1\u03b2) ( Histological analysis of joint tissues in the ipsilateral foot revealed reduced leukocyte infiltration into the midfoot joints of mice receiving CTLA4-Ig and combination therapy with CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb (Fig. 5 , A to F; yellow arrows, moderate to severe synovitis; white arrows, absent or mild synovitis). We next quantitated the number of inflammatory cells per high-power field (HPF) in the synovial space of the midfoot. CTLA4-Ig and combination therapy with CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb resulted in decreased inflammatory cell infiltration into the synovial space (52 cells per HPF in the control group, 22 cells per HPF in CTLA4-Ig group, and 9 cells per HPF in the CTLA4-Ig + anti-CHIKV mAb group, P<0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Histological analysis did not reveal evidence of bone erosion, proteoglycan loss, or effects on expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03baB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) (fig. S1 ). Consistent with a role for CTLA4-Ig in modulating immune cell recruitment, administration of CTLA4-Ig 1 day before infection resulted in reduced swelling on day 7 but not on day 3 ( fig. S2) , a time point at which subcutaneous edema but not immune cell infiltration is observed. To quantitate differences in immune cell infiltration into the entire foot at day 7 after infection, we analyzed by flow cytometry how CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb treatments affected the total numbers of immune cells in the soft tissues of the ipsilateral foot, which included the skin, muscle, and joints. After treatment with CTLA4-Ig or a combination of CTLA4-Ig and anti-CHIKV mAb, we observed about a three-to fourfold reduction in the number of total CD45 + leukocytes (Fig. 6 , A and B; P < 0.0005) with markedly reduced numbers of Ly6C + CD11b + inflammatory monocytes, natural killer cells, and CD8 + T cells, and a nearly complete absence of CD4 + T cells (Fig. 6 , B to G). By contrast, treatment with the anti-CHIKV mAb alone did not reduce the number of infiltrating CD45 + cells or individual leukocyte subsets into the infected foot (Fig. 6 , A to G).",

Leukocyte subsets infiltrating the peripheral joints of CHIKV-infected mice primarily consist of T cells, inflammatory monocytes, and macrophages (4). When we blocked T cell costimulation with CTLA4-Ig, we observed reduced infiltration of T cells and inflammatory monocytes into the joints of infected animals, although this was not sufficient to eliminate the clinical disease completely. Treatment of TCR\u03b2\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 mice with CTLA4-Ig had no effect on joint swelling, suggesting that CTLA4-Ig ameliorates clinical disease primarily via its action on T cells. These findings are consistent with previous studies suggesting that joint swelling in the foot of CD4 \u2212/\u2212 animals is reduced in severity but not completely controlled (20) . Our findings suggest that other inhibitors of CD4 + T cell function also might limit musculoskeletal disease associated with CHIKV infection. Teo et al. (32) recently demonstrated that treatment with fingolimod, an agonist of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor, limited infiltration of CD4 + T cells into CHIKV-infected joints and adjacent muscle in mice, resulting in reduced joint swelling and muscle necrosis.",

We found that treatment of WT mice 3 days after CHIKV infection with an antiviral human mAb reduced but did not eliminate joint swelling, although infectious virus could not be detected in the joints within 2 days of therapy. Foot swelling likely depends on multiple factors including synovitis, myositis, and edema resulting from production of proinflammatory cytokines (4). The anti-CHIKV mAb eliminated infectious virus within 2 days of its administration and reduced foot swelling without altering leukocyte infiltration into joints of infected animals, suggesting that leukocyte recruitment is not the only factor that affects disease severity in this model. Local cytokine production in specific compartments (for example, serum, muscles, or joints) independently may affect the virus-induced swelling or edema. Future histological studies may define better the precise mechanism by which neutralization of infectious CHIKV by antiviral antibodies ameliorates foot swelling.",

Remarkably, treatment with tofacitinib, which blocks JAK/STAT signaling that is downstream of Ifnar1 and other cytokine receptors, reduced clinical disease without ostensible effects on morbidity or mortality. This result may be related to the pharmacodynamics of tofacitinib including its short half-life (13) . Tofacitinib therapy may blunt cytokine production and/or leukocyte infiltration without enhancement of CHIKV replication.

            "text": "Anecdotal reports in humans have suggested that methotrexate may be effective for treatment of CHIKV arthritis (16, 35) . In our studies, a low dose of methotrexate did not provide benefit against acute arthritis. It remains possible that methotrexate would show greater benefit if higher doses were used. Mouse models of Ross River virus arthritis previously revealed exacerbation of disease after treatment with etanercept (36), whereas an uncontrolled study in humans suggested that blockade of TNF-\u03b1 provided some benefit in 13 patients who were diagnosed with a \"chronic rheumatologic disease\" after acute CHIKV infection (35) . However, it is important to note that some patients infected with CHIKV may develop rheumatologic disease sporadically or coincidentally after CHIKV infection. In a controlled study of mice infected with CHIKV, we did not find a benefit of etanercept therapy with acute CHIKV arthritis, but we were unable to assess chronic disease because of the histopathological absence of frank arthritis during the chronic phase. In light of our animal model results and the anecdotal nature of previous human studies, it seems that rigorous, blinded, placebo-controlled studies in human patients are necessary to define which DMARD therapies may be safe and optimal in patients with chronic CHIKV arthritis. CHIKV and related arthritogenic alphaviruses directly invade the joints and leave persistent viral RNA in the joints and surrounding tissues even in the absence of detectable infectious virus (28) . In previous studies, we found that most CHIKV-infected control C57BL/6 mice did not exhibit histopathological evidence of chronic arthritis 1 month after infection, although there was mild chronic tenosynovitis and myositis in some animals (4) . Because we could readily detect viral RNA in the joints at day 28, our studies suggest that persistent viral RNA may not be sufficient to cause clinically apparent chronic arthritis in mice and that other factors must contribute to pathogenesis. Thus, it remains to be determined whether our combination treatment with an antiviral antibody and CTLA4-Ig has beneficial effects in chronic CHIKV arthritis. Other animal models with more severe chronic disease (for example, nonhuman primates) may be required to address these questions.",

Our initial observation was that treatment with antiviral antibody reduced infectious viral burden in the ipsilateral joint and that therapy with CTLA4-Ig diminished recruitment of T cells and inflammatory monocytes as well as the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Subsequent histological analysis confirmed these findings. We measured viral titers and RNA in tissues, immunologic parameters (including influx of specific cell subtypes into the joints and surrounding tissues), and cytokine levels. Sample sizes and end points were selected on the basis of our extensive experience with these systems. Mice were age-and sex-matched between groups. Histological analysis was performed in a blinded fashion. Initial footpad measurements were performed by three individuals in an unblinded fashion. However, the measurements after CTLA4-Ig treatment were reproduced by a fourth individual who performed a blinded assessment. Investigators were not blinded when conducting virus tissue burden analysis, cytokine measurements, or flow cytometry analysis. All primary data are in the Supplementary Materials (table S1).",
