A compound library consisting of 960 commercially available drugs and biologically active substances was screened for inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CL protease. Potent inhibition was achieved using the mercury-containing compounds thimerosal and phenylmercuric acetate, as well as hexachlorophene. As well, 1-10 lM of each compound inhibited viral replication in Vero E6 cell culture. Detailed mechanism studies using a fluorescence-based protease assay demonstrated that the three compounds acted as competitive inhibitors (K i = 0.7, 2.4, and 13.7 lM for phenylmercuric acetate, thimerosal, and hexachlorophene, respectively). A panel of metal ions including Zn 2\u00fe and its conjugates were then evaluated for their anti-3CL protease activities. Inhibition was more pronounced using a zinc-conjugated compound (1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc; K i = 0:17 lM) than using the ion alone (K i = 1:1 lM).",

Subsequent analysis of the virus has revealed features that may be used in preventative or therapeutic strategies. Analogous to the 3C proteases encoded by picornaviruses, a virally encoded 3C-like (3CL) protease that functions in the maturation of viral polyproteins is essential for the completion of the SARS-CoV life cycle [5] . It is a chymotrypsin-like protease that uses a Cys rather than a Ser residue as the nucleophile in the active site. The 3CL protease contains an additional helical C-terminal domain of about 100 residues, absent from the analogous picornavirus 3C and chymotrypsin, which is essential for enzymatic activity. Its removal obviates proteolytic activity, since this critical domain is responsible for the dimerization of the protease, which is a prerequisite for proteolytic activity [6] . Moreover, the active site of the SARS-CoV 3CL protease comprises a catalytic dyad rather than a triad.",

Crystallization of the protease [7, 8] has led to the identification of several candidate inhibitors in computer modeling studies [9, 10] and biological assays [11] . However, to date, a detailed exploration of inhibitor activity has been lacking. Previously, we developed a fluorescence-based assay suitable to screen inhibitors of the protease in a high throughput format [12, 13] . We used this system presently to screen a compound library consisting of 960 mostly commercially available drugs and biologically active substances. In light of previous reports, we were interested in examining the influence of metal-conjugated compounds on protease activity [14] [15] [16] .

After two days, cells were harvested and lysed.

After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond-C extra membrane using a semidry apparatus (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The membranes were blocked with Blotto/ Tween blocking buffer (5 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 77 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 2.5% skimmed milk, and 0.001% antiform A) and then incubated with BALB/c anti-rS268, which is an anti-spike polyclonal antibody [17] . The membrane was then washed with blocking buffer and further incubated with goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The membrane was finally washed with blocking buffer and developed with ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Amersham Biosciences).",

As shown, Western blots revealed that 10 lM phenylmercuric acetate suppressed detection of the viral spike protein (Fig. 1) . The actin level in Vero E6 cells treated with phenylmercuric acetate and then infected by SARS-CoV was lower, indicating that at a concentration of 10 lM the compound might be toxic to the cells. The presence of 1 lM thimerosal diminished the detectable quantity of the spike protein by over 90 percent (Fig. 1) . Similar observations were obtained using 10 lM hexachlorophene (Fig. 1) . The latter two compounds displayed no apparent toxic effect, as evidenced by the unchanged actin levels. This hexachlorophene concentration also showed strong inhibition of cytopathic effect on virus-infected Vero E6 cells (results not shown).

Several metal ions inhibit Cys protease via the interaction with a nucleophilic sulfur anion [14] . SARS-CoV 3CL protease is also a Cys protease. Presently, seven transition metal ions were tested. While Hg 2\u00fe , Zn 2\u00fe and Cu 2\u00fe were effective, Co 2\u00fe , Mg 2\u00fe , Mn 2\u00fe , and Ni 2\u00fe did not inhibit 3CL protease activity. These metal ions are non-competitive inhibitors by virtue of their size. They are too small to block substrate binding, despite being capable of interaction with the active site Cys residue. Phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate are similar to Hg 2\u00fe in their inhibitory power. However, the observed markedly higher affinity of 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc for the protease, compared to Zn 2\u00fe , is consistent with the suggestion that the former is a more specific 3CL inhibitor. It is noteworthy that Zn-containing compounds such as zinc acetate are added as a supplement to the drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease [21] , indicating the safety of the ion for human use. More relevantly, zinc salts such as zincum gluconicum (Zenullose) may be effective in treating the common cold, a disease caused by rhinoviruses, without knowledge of the molecular target [22] . Thus, the present documentation of the anti-SARS, sub-micromolar K i action of Zn-conjugated compounds provides a firm foundation on which to embark upon SARS therapeutic drug explorations. Fig. 4 . The K i measurements for zinc ion. The reaction velocities of SARS 3CL protease in the absence (s) or presence of 3 (m) and 5 lM (j) Zn 2\u00fe and various substrate concentrations ranged from 8 to 80 lM were used to determine the K i value (1.1 lM) of Zn 2\u00fe by fitting the data with Eq. (2) using KinetAsyst II program. The inhibition pattern indicates that zinc ion is non-competitive with respect to the substrate. Fig. 3 .
