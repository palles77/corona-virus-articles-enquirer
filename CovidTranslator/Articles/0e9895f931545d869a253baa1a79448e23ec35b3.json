            "text": "Three-dimensional objects can be represented using Cartesian, spherical or cylindrical coordinate systems, among many others. Currently all protein 3D structures in the PDB are in Cartesian coordinates. We wanted to explore the possibility that protein 3D structures, especially the globular type (spheroproteins), when represented in spherical coordinates might find useful novel applications. A Fortran program was written to transform protein 3D structure files in Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to spherical coordinates (\u03c1, \u03c6, \u03b8), with the centroid of the protein molecule as origin. We present here two applications, namely, (1) separation of the protein outer layer (OL) from the inner core (IC); and (2) identifying protrusions and invaginations on the protein surface. In the first application, \u03c6 and \u03b8 were partitioned into suitable intervals and the point with maximum \u03c1 in each such '\u03c6-\u03b8 bin' was determined. A suitable cutoff value for \u03c1 is adopted, and for each \u03c6-\u03b8 bin, all points with \u03c1 values less than the cutoff are considered part of the IC, and those with \u03c1 values equal to or greater than the cutoff are considered part of the OL. We show that this separation procedure is successful as it gives rise to an OL that is significantly more enriched in hydrophilic amino acid residues, and an IC that is significantly more enriched in hydrophobic amino acid residues, as expected. In the second application, the point with maximum \u03c1 in each \u03c6-\u03b8 bin are sequestered and their frequency distribution constructed (i.e., maximum \u03c1's sorted from lowest to highest, collected into 1.50\u00c5-intervals, and the frequency in each interval plotted). We show in such plots that invaginations on the protein surface give rise to subpeaks or shoulders on the lagging side of the main peak, while protrusions give rise to similar subpeaks or shoulders, but on the leading side of the main peak. We used the dataset of Laskowski et al. (1996) to demonstrate both applications.",

In this reduced representation, each amino acid is represented as two data points: the centroid of the backbone atoms (N, C\u03b1, C and O), and the centroid of the side-chain atoms (C\u03b2 and beyond). The centroid of the backbone is calculated by finding the average position of the backbone atoms N, C\u03b1, C, and O); similarly the centroid of the side-chain is calculated by finding the average position of the side-chain atoms (C\u03b2 and beyond).

However, a simpler classification is possible if only the side chain centroids are considered as these points will lie either on the IC or OL but only extremely rarely on the boundary. We shall adopt this last classification. 2.1.5 Using the OL to predict candidate epitopes Our epitope prediction algorithm assumes that potential epitopes are clusters of points (atoms or centroids) on the OL. We thus assign a point density for each \u03c6-\u03b8 bin on the OL; this number is equal to the number of p oints (atoms or centroids) in the \u03c6-\u03b8 bin divided by the area of the \u03c6-\u03b8 bin, which we denote by A \u03c6\u03b8b . Note that by A \u03c6\u03b8b we mean the area of the spherical rectangle bounded by two \u03c6 and two \u03b8 limits. Whereas the number of points in a \u03c6-\u03b8 bin is readily obtained from our algorithm programs, the areas of the \u03c6-\u03b8 bins vary with respect to their location on the surface, with those close to the \"equator\" (\u03c6 = 90 \u2022 ) significantly larger than those lying close to the \"poles\" (\u03c6 = 0 \u2022 and 180 \u2022 ). They also vary with respect to their distances from the protein molecular centroid, with those farther from the molecular centroid (large \u03c1's) larger than those closer to the molecular centroid (small \u03c1's). We thus require a formula for the area of a \u03c6-\u03b8 bin that captures these two dependencies -this idea is illustrated in Fig. 1C Classification of Amino Acid Residues in the OL-IC Separation Fig. 3 Classifying amino acid residues after phi-theta binning. After applying the OL-IC separation procedure for a protein in DCRR, its amino acid residues may be classified as being located in the OL or the IC, based simply on their side chain centroids. If backbone centroids are considered, four possibilities are possible, since residues near the boundary can have backbone and side chain centroids in the OL or IC, respectively, and vice versa.",

The derivation of this formula is straightforward and is left to the reader. The point density, D, for each \u03c6-\u03b8 bin is thus equal to B/A \u03c6\u03b8b , where B is the number of coordinates in the \u03c6-\u03b8 bin. For fine binning, the factor |\u03b8 1 -\u03b8 2 | is 8 \u2022 while for coarse binning it is 10 \u2022 Hence A \u03c6\u03b8b depends only on \u03c6 and \u03c1 for a given binning mode. A typical plot of point density (z-axis) as a function of \u03c6 and \u03b8 (x-y plane) is illustrated in Fig. 4 . Peaks in this plot represent clusters of points on the OL of the protein.",

This illustrates the ability for the algorithm to produce either more sensitive or more selective results depending on which binning method is chosen. When these proteins were cross-referenced against the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB; Vita et al., 2010) , it was found that all of these proteins contained true epitopes and were antigenic in some capacity. Discrepancies between the numbers of predicted epitopes and true epitopes is due to several factors, including: overly sensitive candidate epitope cutoff criteria, the incomplete and ever-changing nature of the IEDB and PDB databases, and protein-protein interaction sites that appear to be candidate epitope according to the algorithm.

The number of predicted active sites for each protein using the coarse and the fine binning modes is shown in Table 3 (Kim, D.J., personal commun.). The coarse binning produced a larger number of predicted active sites than the fine binning mode throughout each protein analyzed. Again, this illustrates the ability for the algorithm to produce either more sensitive or more selective results depending on which binning method is chosen. Refinement of the details of the current binning process remains one of our major goals for this project.",

The algorithm outputted a reduced number of candidate epitopes with AAR/fb and AAR/cb compared to the other two since the \u03c6-\u03b8 bin size is too small and thus atoms in amino acid residues are being split between neighboring bins, or amino acid residues themselves are being precluded from becoming clustered in a single bin, thus preventing the algorithm form \"seeing\" (i.e., detecting) it. This complication is further compounded when atoms in an amino acid residue are split between the OL and the IC of a \u03c6-\u03b8 bin.",

When proteins are in DCRR, the amino acid residues may be classified as either in the OL or IC depending on where their side chain centroids are located, which is almost never exactly on the OL-IC boundary. But when the backbone centroids are taken into account, the amino acid residues may be of four types: (a) both backbone and side chain centroids are located within the OL; (b) both backbone and side chain centroids are located within the IC; (c) the backbone centroid is in the OL while the side chain centroid is in the IC; and (d) the backbone centroid is in the IC while the side chain centroid is in the OL (Fig. 3) . We term the first case \"OL residues\", the second case \"IC residues\", the third case \"boundary inward residues\", and the fourth case \"boundary outward residues\". To sum up, we conclude that the best combination method is DCRR/cb, although use of the other three combinations in some special cases (e.g., small proteins or structured peptides) is not ruled out.",

Being able to separate the OL from the IC allowed us to investigate surface properties (from the OL) and buried properties (from the IC) of the protein systematically and independently. For example, we were able to predict potential epitopes and protein-protein interaction sites from the OL, and buried functional sites such as catalytic residues in the IC. We are convinced that our separation method works properly and is valid because when applied to a test set of 67 protein structures in Laskowski et al. (1996) , we found that all but a few have OLs that are significantly enriched with hydrophilic amino acids and ICs that are significantly enriched with hydrophobic amino acids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that spherical coordinate representation has been utilized in protein 3D structural analysis.
