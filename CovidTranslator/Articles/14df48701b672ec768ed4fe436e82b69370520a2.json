            "text": "Lung cancer is the most common malignant tumor, accounting for 25% of cancerrelated deaths and 14% of new cancers worldwide. Lung adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pulmonary cancer. Although there have been some improvements in the traditional therapy of lung cancer, the outcome and prognosis of patients remain poor. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with 1.8 million new cases being diagnosed each year. Precision medicine based on genetic alterations is considered a new strategy of lung cancer treatment that requires highly specific biomarkers for precision diagnosis and treatment. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) plays important roles in both innate and adaptive immunity. However, the diagnostic value of FGL2 in lung cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the expression profile and potential functions of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma. We used the TCGA and Oncomine datasets to compare the FGL2 expression levels between lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal tissues. We utilized the GEPIA, PrognoScan and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases to analyze the relationship between FGL2 expression and the survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Then, we investigated the potential roles of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma with the TIMER database and functional enrichment analyses. We found that FGL2 expression was significantly lower in lung adenocarcinoma tissue compared with adjacent normal tissue. A high expression level of FGL2 was correlated with better prognostic outcomes of lung adenocarcinoma patients, including overall survival and progression-free survival. FGL2 was positively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells, including dendritic cells, CD8 + T cells, macrophages, B cells, and CD4 + T cells, in lung adenocarcinoma. Functional enrichment analyses also showed that a high expression level of FGL2 was positively correlated with enhanced T cell activities, especially CD8 + T cell activation. Thus, we propose that high FGL2 expression, which is positively associated with enhanced antitumor activities mediated by T cells, is a beneficial marker for lung adenocarcinoma treatment outcomes. . 2020. FGL2 is positively correlated with enhanced antitumor responses mediated by T cells in lung adenocarcinoma.

As a highly prevalent and invasive disorder in women and men, more than 1.8 million people are diagnosed with lung cancer every year (Torre, Siegel & Jemal, 2016) . Lung cancer accounts for almost 25% of cancer-related deaths and 14% of new cancers worldwide. Although there have been some improvements in the therapy and diagnosis of lung cancer, the outcome and prognosis of patients remain poor. The 5-year survival rate varies from 4-17% depending on regional and stage differences. Almost 1.6 million people die from lung cancer yearly. The lack of effective first-line drugs, the nonoptimal administration route and the formation of resistant tumors might be correlated with the poor prognostic survival of lung cancer patients (Pilkington et al., 2015) .",

As the most common type of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma belongs to the non-small cell lung cancer group. Fifty percent of non-small cell lung cancer patients have a lung adenocarcinoma. It is also the most common form of lung cancer in Asian countries. The symptoms and signs of lung adenocarcinoma are similar to those of other types of lung cancer (Zappa & Mousa, 2016) . Shortness of breath and persistent cough are the main symptoms of lung adenocarcinoma patients. The category of lung adenocarcinoma includes a variety of subtypes, such as acinar predominant adenocarcinoma, lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma, and micropapillary predominant adenocarcinoma. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgical resection, and immunotherapy are common therapies employed to treat lung adenocarcinoma. However, because of the difficulties in diagnosing early lung adenocarcinoma, the average five-year survival rate is only approximately 18% (Hirsch et al., 2017) .",

The concerns or limitations were list as follows: the null distribution of GSEA is superfluous and very hard to be worth calculating. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like statistic is not as sensitive as original. The results of GSEA are dependent on the algorithm clusters the genes, and the number of clusters being analyzed. The PrognoScan database is a new database (http://dna00.bio.kyutech.ac.jp/PrognoScan/) used to explore the relation between patient prognosis and gene expression with large collections of tumor microarray datasets. It is a useful platform to evaluate potential tumor markers in cancer research.

            "text": "Previous studies have found that many gene mutations contribute to lung adenocarcinoma. The mutated genes include EGFR, KRAS, TP53, STK11, NF1, and KEAP1. The EGFR-activating mutation frequency varies depending on ethnicity and region. EGFR is correlated with the cell proliferation, invasion, survival, and angiogenesis of tumors (Sharma et al., 2007) . Oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib prolonged progression-free survival and the objective response rate compared with traditional chemotherapy (Mok et al., 2009; Shepherd et al., 2005) . The inactivation of KEAP1 in KRAS mutations is related to the inhibition of glutaminase in lung cancer (Romero et al., 2017) . TP53 mutations are commonly found in advanced-grade lung adenocarcinoma (Ahrendt et al., 2003) . Precision medicine also provides genes that are beneficial for the progression and survival of cancers. FGL2 is an important factor in regulating the immune system. FGL2 is upregulated in GBM, promoting GBM development by suppressing dendritic cell activities (Yan et al., 2015) . However, the diagnostic value of FGL2 in lung cancer is largely unknown. In this study, we systematically investigated the expression profile and potential functions of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma. First, we evaluated the expression of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma tissue and adjacent normal tissue. Data obtained from the TCGA dataset and the Oncomine database indicated that FGL2 expression was significantly lower in lung adenocarcinoma tissue than in adjacent normal tissue. This implied that FGL2 might be a beneficial biomarker of lung adenocarcinoma.",

            "text": "Then, we explored the correlation between FGL2 expression and the immune status in the tumor microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma. FGL2 expression was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune marker sets in lung adenocarcinoma. The immune cells included CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells. CD8 + T cells (often called cytotoxic T lymphocytes or CTLs) are very important for tumor surveillance. CD8 + T cells use three major mechanisms to kill tumor cells. The first is the secretion of cytokines (primarily TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3). Our results showed that high FGL2 expression was positively correlated with IFN-\u03b3 production and signaling and TNF-\u03b1 production and signaling. The second major function is the production and release of cytotoxic granules, which mainly contain perforin 1 (PRF1) and granzymes. Our results showed that the expression level of FGL2 was positively correlated with the expression levels of PRF1, granzyme K (GZMK ), GZMA, GZMH, GZMB, and GZMM. The third antitumor function of CD8 + T cells is to induce the apoptosis of tumor cells via Fas/Fas ligand (FasLG) interactions. Our results showed that the expression level of FGL2 was positively correlated with the expression levels of Fas and FasLG. These results show that high FGL2 expression is closely related to enhanced CD8 + T cell-mediated antitumor activities. Dendritic cells (DCs) are considered important factors that provide protective immunity against lung adenocarcinoma (Wang, Huang & Li, 2019) . Inactive DCs are correlated with the poor prognosis of lung cancer patients. DCs present antigens to activate antitumor T cells. Mature DCs in lung cancer express high levels of cytokines and costimulatory molecules (CD40/80/86) to activate T cells (Macri et al., 2018) . MHC type II molecules on DCs promote the activation of CD4 + T cells. MHC type 1 molecules on DCs promote the activation of CD8 + T cells (Liu & Cao, 2015) . Except for activating T cells, DCs can also recruit and activate NK cells by secreting C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) at the tumor site (Liu et al., 2008) . In our study, we found that FGL2 expression was positively corelated to the infiltration of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, macrophages, B cells and DCs in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, the FGL2 level was positively correlated with several subtypes of immune cells, including effector memory CD8 + T cells, activated CD8 + T cells, activated CD4 + T cells, type 1 T helper cells, effector memory CD4 + T cells, central memory CD8 + T cells, immature dendritic cells and natural killer T cells. These results indicate that FGL2 plays an important role in antitumor immunity by enhancing antitumor activities in lung adenocarcinoma.",

As for B cells, Table 1 indicated the correlation of B cells gene markers varied from 0.21-0.316. In Table 2 , the correlation of B cells gene markers varied from 0.24-0.29. In addition, Fig. 3A indicated the correlation between FGL2 and B cells was 0.409. The results showed that FGL2 has not possessed strong correlation with B cells in the tumor microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma. Tumor infiltrating B cells appear in every stage of lung cancer and play critical roles in shaping tumor progression. However, the B cells functions in antitumor immunity of lung cancer are controversial (Wang et al., 2019) . Some studies demonstrated that tumor infiltrating B cells have protective effects on anti-tumor immunity in lung cancer, while other studies revealed that tumor infiltrating B cells have inhibitory effects on antitumor immunity in lung cancer. Owning to the B cells functions in antitumor immunity is dualistic, FGL2 might possessed poor or moderate correlation with B cells in the tumor microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma. Apart from B cells, Fig. 3A showed correlation between FGL2 and CD4 + T cells was 0.373. This result indicated that the correlation between FGL2 and CD4 + T cells was moderate at best. Previous studies found that the role of CD4 + T cells in antitumor activity of lung cancer is dualistic (Zheng, Hu & Yao, 2017) . Some types of CD4 + T cells impair the functions of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to promote the tumor development, while some types of CD4 + T cells induce the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes to exert antitumor immune response. This might explain the reason that correlation between FGL2 and CD4 + T cells was poor and moderate in lung adenocarcinoma.",

CD8 + T cells, also known as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), play important role of antitumor immune response in the tumor microenvironment (Aerts & Hegmans, 2013) . CTLs could recognize and kill tumor cells by the complex formation of T-cell receptor (TCR) and human leukocyte antigen class (HLA). TCR and related signaling molecules could activate the transduction cascade to induce immune synapse and stimulate antitumor responses of CTLs (Farhood, Najafi & Mortezaee, 2019) . Then, the activated CTLs produce and secret cytotoxic granules such as granzymes and perforin into the targeted tumor cells. Adhesive and co-stimulatory molecules including CD80/CD86, CD11a/CD18, and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) are important in the process of TCR-mediated CTLs antitumor effects (Durgeau et al., 2018) . CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)-ligand (PD-L1) are checkpoint receptors could be targeted to relieve CTLs exhaustion. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages could activate na\u00efve CD8 + T cells by binding the TCRs with CD3 and other costimulatory molecules.

            "text": "There are no significant differences in the expression levels of FGL2 between patients with or without EGFR or KRAS mutations in the TCGA database. There is no significant correlation between FGL2 and other genes implicated in lung adenocarcinoma such as EGFR, KRAS, TP53, STK11, NF1, and KEAP1. We speculated that FGL2 might indirectly affect those genes in lung adenocarcinoma by changing the immune status in the tumor environment. EGFR regulates several signaling transduction cascades such as MAPK, JNK, and Akt signaling pathways, leading to tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis (Bethune et al., 2019) . EGFR-targeted therapy such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) alters the tumor microenvironment in lung cancer (Matsumoto et al., 2019) . EGFR-TKIs could increase cytotoxic CD8 + T cells and dendritic cells in the tumor environment of lung cancer (Jia et al., 2019) . FGL2 also increase cytotoxic CD8 + T cells and dendritic cells in the tumor environment of lung cancer. So, FGL2 might affect EGFR by influencing immune status in tumor environment of lung cancer. KRAS is important in promoting cell survival and growth in tumor cells. Almost 30% patients with lung adenocarcinoma are positive for KRAS gene mutation (Tomasini et al., 2016) . KRAS is a strong initiator of tumorigenesis in lung adenocarcinoma. It is also a predictive response to targeted therapy of lung adenocarcinoma (Dias Carvalho et al., 2018) . KRAS is related with immune-suppressed state by regulating components of adaptive and innate immune response (Cullis, Das & Bar-Sagi, 2018) . Mutant KRAS could up-regulate immunosuppressive cells in tumor such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), CD4 + FoxP3 + T regulatory cells, and CD19 + IL10 + B regulatory cells. These immunosuppressive cells could suppress the activities of tumoricidal cells such as CD8 + T cytotoxic cells, natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor microenvironment. On the contrary, FGL2 could increase the levels of tumoricidal cells such as CD8 + T cytotoxic cells, natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor microenvironment. So, FGL2 affect KRAS by influencing immune status in tumor environment of lung cancer. TP53 is regarded as tumor suppressor gene that it could prevent genome mutation. TP53 could activate DNA repair process and arrest cell proliferation by holding cell cycle (Uehara & Tanaka, 2018) . Mutation of TP53 leads to tumor escape from senescence and apoptosis. Activation of TP53 could increase the levels of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes such as CD8 + T cells in tumor microenvironment (Guo et al., 2017) . FGL2 also increases the levels of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes such as CD8 + T cells in tumor microenvironment. So, FGL2 possesses synergic effects with TP53 to enhance antitumor immunity in tumor microenvironment. STK11, known as liver kinase B1 (LKB1), regulates cell polarity and regarded as tumor suppressor. Loss of STK11 would lead to cell polarity disorganization and induce tumor growth. Koyama et al. found that loss of STK11/LKB1 induced neutrophil recruitment and inflammatory mediator production to suppress the T cells in tumor environment of lung cancer (Koyama et al., 2016) . In addition, STK11/LKB1 inactivated mutations were related with reduced expression of PD-1 ligand PD-L1 in tumor cells. So, we infer that FGL2 exert synergic effects with STK11 to enhance the cytotoxic T lymphocytes activities in tumor environment of lung adenocarcinoma. NF1 is regarded as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer negatively regulates RAS signaling pathway. NF1 mutations present in similar patients populations with KRAS mutation (Redig et al., 2016) . We infer that FGL2 affect KRAS by influencing immune status in tumor environment of lung adenocarcinoma. So, FGL2 might affect NF1 function by influencing immune status in tumor environment of lung adenocarcinoma. KEAP1 has been shown to interact with nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). KEAP1-NRF2 pathway play important role in oxidative response by inducing anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. KEAP1 mutation is correlated with poor prognosis of lung cancer (Frank et al., 2018) . Aberrant KEAP1-NRF2 pathway activity alters the immune microenvironment of lung adenocarcinoma. KEAP1 mutation is associated reduced leukocyte infiltration of tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma (Thorsson et al., 2018) . We infer that FGL2 affects the KEAP1 effect by influencing immune status in tumor environment of lung adenocarcinoma. So, we infer some indirect correlations might explain the mechanism of FGL2 affecting other genes. FGL2 might affect other genes functions by influencing immune status in tumor environment of lung adenocarcinoma.",

            "text": "In this study, we explored the expression profile and potential effects of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma. We found that FGL2 expression was significantly lower in lung adenocarcinoma tissue than in adjacent normal tissue. High FGL2 mRNA expression was correlated with better prognostic outcomes of lung adenocarcinoma patients, including overall survival and progression-free survival. These results indicate that FGL2 might function as a negative regulator of lung adenocarcinoma. Then, we investigated the potential mechanism of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma. FGL2 was positively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells, including CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells, in lung adenocarcinoma. These results imply that FGL2 exerts its antitumor effects by enhancing immune cell infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma. GO and KEGG functional enrichment analyses and GSEA also showed that FGL2 expression was positively correlated with enhanced tumor killing. Thus, we propose that FGL2, which is positively associated with enhanced antitumor activities mediated by T cells, is a beneficial marker for lung adenocarcinoma treatment outcomes. In this study, we used bioinformatic analysis to discover the potential roles of FGL2 in lung adenocarcinoma. In the future studies, in vivo and in vitro experiments will carry out to demonstrate the role of FGL2 in modulating the T cell-mediated immune response in lung adenocarcinoma.",

(A) There was a significant difference between the FPKM value of FGL2 mRNA expression in lung adenocarcinoma and normal adjacent tissue (P < 0.001). The left bar indicates the FPKM value of FGL2 mRNA expression in lung adenocarcinoma tissue (mean FPKM value = 3.958). The right bar indicates the FPKM value of FGL2 expression level in normal adjacent tissue (mean FPKM value = 3.266). (B) The microarray database from PNAS showed a significant difference in the FGL2 mRNA levels between lung adenocarcinoma and normal adjacent tissues (P = 0.001). (C) The GSE32863 database showed that the FGL2 expression level in lung adenocarcinoma tissue was significantly lower than that in normal adjacent tissue (P < 0.001).Full-size DOI: 10.7717/peerj.8654/fig-1",
