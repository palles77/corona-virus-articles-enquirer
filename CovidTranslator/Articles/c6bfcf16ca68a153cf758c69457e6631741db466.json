These researchers challenged the model by contending that it is difficult to find the right proxy for the market portfolio. Also, the CAPM does not appear to accurately reflect firm size in the cost of equity calculation, and that not all systematic risk factors are reflected in returns of the market portfolio. A great deal of anomalous evidence has been produced suggesting that things other than b are important in determining expected returns (Jagannathan and McGrattan, 1995) . Although several limitations regarding the CAPM still exist, the model was used by almost 65% of the Fortune 1000 companies in 1997 (Gitman and Vandenberg, 2000) and 3 5 of the CFOs indicated that CAPM was their primary cost of equity calculation method (Graham and Harvey, 2001) .",

In addition, the model assumes that the factors and error terms have a mean of zero. Although the model does not explicitly specify the risk factors, the APM depicts a world with many possible sources of risk and uncertainty, instead of seeking for equilibrium in which all investors hold the same portfolio. More formally, the APM is based upon the assumption that there are some major macroeconomic factors that influence security returns. The APM states that no matter how thoroughly investors diversify, they cannot avoid these factors. Thus investors will ''price'' these factors precisely because they are sources of risk that cannot be diversified away. That is, they will demand compensation in terms of expected return for holding securities exposed to these risks. Just like the CAPM, this exposure is measured by a factor beta (Goetzmann, 1996) .",

This approach suffers from oversimplification, because firms vary greatly in their rate of dividend payout, and the method does not specifically address the effect of reinvestment of retained earnings (Helfert, 2003) . This is due to the fact that common stockholders are the residual owners of all earnings not reserved for other obligations, and dividends paid are usually only a portion of the earnings accruing to common shares.

Many of these companies do not actually own assets and produce their future cash flows from management contracts or franchise agreements. In many cases they may also lease hotels and the leases do not appear on their balance sheets. Instead, these firms hold an equity position in a different company that holds these leases. Therefore, it is almost unfeasible to properly assess the book value of the lodging firms which confounds the application of the FF model. Sheel (1995) was the first researcher in the hospitality industry to point out that CAPM does not seem to meet the industry needs and called for further research into industry-specific factors. In the mainstream financial economics field, Downe (2000) argued that in a world of increasing returns, risk cannot be considered a function of only systematic factors, and thus beta. He postulated that the position of the firm in the industry, as well as the nature of the industry itself become risk factors. Thus, firms with a dominant position in the industry that succeed to adapt to the complexities of the business environment will have a different risk profile than their competitors. This argument is particularly well-fitting in the context of the lodging industry. Barrows and Naka (1994) demonstrated that macroeconomic factors fail to explain the common variation of lodging stock returns. Their study encompassed the 27-year period between 1965 and 1991 and employed five factors that were slightly different than the five factors of Chen et al. (1986) . Barrows and Naka postulated that the return of the stocks is a function of the following five factors:",

This finding looks very ambiguous given the fact that none of the five variables was significant at .05 level. Barrows and Naka (1994) results can be attributed to the fact that unlike financial institutions that are heavily influenced by the changes in term structure and unexpected inflation, other industries (such as lodging) seem not to respond to these changes immediately (Chan et al., 1998) . Chan et al. (1998) went a step further in their argument by contending that widely used factors such as unanticipated inflation and change in industrial production do not seem to be more useful than a randomly generated series of numbers. Sheikh (1996) further supports this view by pointing out that although macroeconomic factors seem to be intuitively appealing for managers and scholars, they account for merely 10.9% of the variation in security returns.",

This implies that it is not yet known how firm fundamentals such as profitability or growth produce common variation in returns associated with size and BE/ME factors and this variation is not captured by the market return itself. Fama and French (1993) further query whether specific fundamentals can be identified as state variables (variables that describe variation in the investment opportunity set) and whether these variables are independent of the market and carry a different premium than the general market risk.

As Fama and French (1997) stated the cost of equity estimates yielded by these models are distressingly imprecise. Standard errors of more than 3% per year were typical when the CAPM and FF models were used to estimate industry costs of equity in their study (Fama and French, 1997) . The authors argued that large standard errors are driven primarily by uncertainty about true factor risk premiums. This obviously means that the standard errors and thus cost of equity capital on a per company, single property (establishment) basis and/or in an investment decision in a new project will be even more imprecise since the lodging industry is really the aggregate of individual units that all have their own unique business environments and return on equity structures. Therefore, the risk determinants of cost of equity and risk factor loadings for individual operating units will be even more difficult to estimate. Along with this, uncertainty about true asset pricing adds further to the misestimating of project values (Fama and French, 1997) . In answering these challenges posed, it is important not only to validate the APM and FF models across hospitality industry segments, but also to strive to identify additional determinants and variables and test them in a more industry relevant cost of equity estimation model.",

In an increasingly competitive environment, the human factor becomes one of the keys in creating sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, Murphy (2003) stated that the hospitality industry should learn to view its employees from a new paradigmthat is that human capital is a strategic intangible asset (knowledge, experience, skills, etc). This implies that, like other assets, it is an important determinant of firm value. However, studies have concluded that ''the research of human resources expenditures'' is in its infancy and is seriously hampered by the absence of publicly disclosed corporate data on human resources (Lev, 2001) . Caroll and Sikich (1999) argued that keeping track of at least a 3-year history of labor costs would serve to identify the dollar value of ''premium'' labor-related costs: which could be thought of as all labor/benefit costs above federally mandated minimum wage. Other techniques proposed by these authors were: (1) to design a scoring system that illustrates productivity vs. both base-line and premium labor/ benefit costs by departments, and (2) to establish metrics to determine a productivity level for guest experience standards, facilities standards, and targeted revenue improvements on a department by department basis. Bloxham (2003) advocated adjustments to certain human resource expenditures to capitalize them over the time of the investment. In that approach, one-time human resources costs are amortized and capitalized in the value creation equation in an effort to demonstrate that human capital investments go beyond being a cost item in the firms' operations. These costs can include recruiting, interviewing, hiring; onetime hiring bonuses and relocation expenses; and training costs. The costs are capitalized and amortized over the average employee tenure with the company. In this case, if employee turnover is high these costs would be amortized over a shorter time period (thus the costs will be higher); whereas, the longer tenure of the workforce will enable the firm to spread the costs over a longer period of time.",

A brand is the product or service of a particular supplier which is differentiated by its name and perceived expectations on the part of the consumer. Brands are important and valuable because they provide a ''certainty'' as to future cash flows (Murphy, 1990) . However, since the task of estimating brand value is yet an improbable one, its value is not specifically reflected on the company's balance sheet. Yet, the lodging industry has made much of the importance of the value of the brand but has not been able to unequivocally substantiate the role of the brand in reducing the variance in firm cash flows, and thus contributing to lower cost of capital for the firm. Srivastava et al. (1998) provided an analytical example of how successful marketbased assets (the term authors use in lieu of intangibles) lower costs by building superior relationships with customers, enable firms to attain price premiums, and generate competitive barriers (via customer loyalty and switching costs). All these factors lead to the conclusion that a strong brand reduces the uncertainty pertaining to the future cash flows which in turn decreases the required return by the investors for the risk they bear by investing in a particular firm.",

A further addition to the brand strength concept came from Prasad and Dev (2000) who developed a hypothetical brand equity index via customer ratings of the brands using five key brand attributes in two sets of indicators, brand performance and brand awareness. Brand performance was measured by overall satisfaction with the product or service, return intent, price-value perception, and brand preference, while brand awareness was measured as top-of-mind brand recall. Olsen (1996) proposed additional brand-related value drivers that were specific to the lodging industry such as brand dilution and brand sincerity ratio. Brand dilution is related to the question of how many new corporate sub-brands must be introduced in order to maintain growth. Whereas, brand sincerity ratio deals with what percentage of hotels in the portfolio currently meet the brand standards or promise.",

While the hospitality industry has disciplined models and sufficient history to determine the financial gains or success of opening a new property in a given city, it lacks the same rigorous models and historical data for technology, especially since each technology projects are unique. Although this problem is not specific to the hospitality industry, it is particularly problematic since the industry tends to be technologically conservative and unwilling to adopt new technology applications based on the promises of their long-term merits especially if it cannot quantify the results and calculate a defined payback period. When uncertainty surrounds the investment, when the timing of the cash flows is unpredictable, and when the investment is perceived as risky, owners and investors will most likely channel their investment capital to projects with more certain returns and minimal risk. Thus, under this thinking, technology will always take a back seat to other organizational priorities and initiatives. Efforts must be made to change this thinking and to develop financial models that can accurately predict and capture the financial benefits derived from technology (1999; p. iii).'' Although there are no hard and fast rules to facilitate the valuations of technology investments, it is common knowledge that technology is transforming the way business is conducted in the lodging industry. Particularly, the surge in Internet usage in the early years of the new millennium brought about the issue of capacity control for the holders of the hotel room inventory. Therefore, firms which are more adaptive to utilize technology to market and sell their perishable product (hotel rooms) may accomplish a lower variation in their future cash flows since they are able to retain greater control over pricing.",

In his study of the restaurant industry, Roh (2002) argued that the parent firm's choice of company-owned and operated vs. franchisee-operated units can affect the variability of cash flows. The author contended that the revenue generated through royalties at unit level causes lower variation in the cash flows for the franchisor company. Whereas, on the other hand, a company-owned unit requires a fixed capital investment which increases firm's leverage and thus, its risk. Therefore, Roh (2002) maintained that restaurants which enter into franchise agreements are less risky than non-franchising companies. This view is supported by Martin (1988) who contended that by owning franchised units the franchisor sheds ''risky'' locations to franchisees and retains the stable locations as company-owned. In addition, Thomas et al. (1990) stated that compared to a wholly company-owned restaurant system, franchise systems are considered less risky because they can be viewed as a portfolio of operating units that can be adjusted in response to changing costs and revenue opportunities.",

Company-owned outlets are managed by employees who confront weaker incentives than franchisees because their capital is not at stake (Minkler and Park, 1994) . Passive investors may recognize this motivational disparity and demand a risk premium when investing in a firm dominated by company-owned outlets (Lafontaine, 1992) . Second, passive investors rely on public information regarding firms' future intentions and abilities (Martin and Justis, 1993) . Franchisees, in contrast, have private information regarding their own intentions and abilities, which reduces the cost of franchisee capital (Combs and Ketchen, 1999) . In essence, franchisees can have greater confidence in themselves than passive investors can have in a firm, suggesting that the latter may demand a larger risk premium (Combs and Ketchen, 2003) .",

This is a very intuitive approach since the process parallels the way people think of their personal investments. However, accepting a return standard as the main expression of riskiness deals only indirectly with true source of risk, that is, the variation of the investment cash flows themselves and key variables they contain. Another constraint with RADR is that a higher discount rate is applied over the life span of the project whereas the risks occur at different points throughout the time pattern. A case in point may be estimating the discount rate for investing in safety and security after recent terrorist attacks to several lodging properties in the major cities worldwide. Applying a single discount for the whole investment period may ignore the risk variations throughout the life of the project. Hence, Helfert (2003) argues that choosing a risk-adjusted rate is fairly subjective. Therefore, the authors of this study conclude that RADR is yet lacking the necessary scientific rigor and consistency to reflect the specific features of lodging firms.",

            "text": "Based upon the discussion in the previous sections, the present paper attempts to propose a contemporary framework that will enable executives and investors to identify which factors best capture systematic return covariation in the context of lodging security returns. Identification of sources of co-movement, and hence source of firm/industry/portfolio risk is an important issue both for practical and theoretical reasons (Chan et al., 1998) . Theoretically, several researchers tried to trace a set of underlying pervasive forces and then use these forces as candidates of priced risk (examples include Ross (1976) , Sharpe (1977), and Connor (1984) ) and thus, propose equilibrium characterizations of the cross-section of average returns. Therefore, the present paper advocates a two-step process for the accomplishment of this endeavor. The first step of this inquiry is to put forward a theoretical model that encompasses all of the propositions discussed in this paper. As it can be seen in Fig. 1 , the theoretical model describes the relationship between the overarching construct (the Risk Premium (RP)) and the other constructs-Human Capital (Hcap), Technology Investment and Utilization (Tech), Safety and Security Index (SSI), Brand Strength Index (BSI), and Industry Factors (IND). The posited model postulates that there is a negative relationship between Hcap and RP, i.e. the higher the human capital investment the lower the risk premium. The relationship between Tech and RP is negative as well, i.e., the better the technology investment utilization the lower the risk premium. The theoretical model contends that there is a positive relationship between SSI and RP, i.e., the higher the safety and security index (more hotel properties located in locations prone to safety and security problems) the higher the risk premium. The BSI and RP demonstrate a negative relationship, i.e., the higher the brand strength index the lower the risk premium. Since the IND construct is measured by numerous unexplored indicators, the sign of the relationship between IND and RP is unknown.",

Hence, given the reality concerned with the available data of lodging firms, it will be safe to say that at the present time it is not possible to obtain time-series data to test the propositions in terms of their full capability of explaining the cross-sectional variation of lodging stock returns. Thus, the present paper takes a step towards proposing an empirical model that attempts to capture industry-specific contextual variables that are conjectured to affect security returns of lodging companies.

The most viable way to operationalize these industry-specific variables in the near future may be achieved by following the methodology of Fama and French (1993) and building four risk mimicking portfolios, namely, High BSI vs. Low BSI, and High POS (firms that primarily own or manage lodging properties) vs. Low POS (firms that primarily franchise their hotels).
