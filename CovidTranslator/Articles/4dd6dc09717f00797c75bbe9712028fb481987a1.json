Invasion ecology, which was proposed as a subdiscipline of ecology by Charles Elton in his book The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants (1958) , aims to understand the causes and consequences of species invasions by focusing on factors that affect the dispersal, establishment, and impact of nonindigenous species (NIS). Later authors expanded on Elton's compendium of cases of invasive species impacts and general hypotheses by linking tools and approaches from other disciplines, such as biogeography, genetics, population biology, conservation biology, and evolution. In particular, large efforts have been devoted to capture the essence of the invasion phenomenon through mathematical models. Recently, researchers have highlighted the utility of species introductions as natural experiments, which can be used to obtain a more profound understanding of general ecological theory. Current studies highlight the role of species invasions as both a consequence and cause of global change, with direct and indirect effects on biodiversity, economics, and environmental and human health.",

This involves (1) an initial establishment phase, where a species arrives to a new region, and during which little or no range expansion occurs, (2) an expansion phase, and (3) a saturation phase, where range expansion reaches a plateau ( Figure 1 ). Under this framework of range expansion, stages 1-3 describe an introduced, exotic, or NIS, whereas an invasive species (i.e., a species in expansion) applies only to stages 2 and 3. Williamson's Tens Rule captures the idea that potential invaders must overcome barriers at each stage of the invasion process to successfully establish and invade new environments. This rule suggests that only a small fraction of the species in a region will arrive to a new environment, that only a small fraction of arriving species will become established in the new environment, and that only a small fraction of established species will invade new environments. The true proportions of potential invaders that succeed at each stage of the process are likely quite variable, with reports ranging from 5% to 50% in some areas. Further work to explicitly evaluate the success of invaders will provide insight into the magnitude of this problem.",

Many anthropogenic activities serve as vectors for the movement of species around the planet. Such human-aided transport of species has occurred for over 10 000 years, as humans dispersing around the world frequently bring other species with them, both deliberately (e.g., species imported for agriculture, decoration, and medicinal purposes) and fortuitously (e.g., species that are transported in the ballast water of ships, seeds, or microorganisms transported on the shoes of travelers).

Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment of a species' population in a new environment (Figures 2 and 3) . It should be highlighted that the majority of species introductions do not move beyond the establishment phase. Furthermore, the duration of the establishment period is variable for different species and even for different populations of the same species. In this sense, a species may arrive to a new environment and be present for a long period of time without expanding its initial distribution, and then it may suddenly increase in abundance and rapidly expand to new areas. Such latent invasions may be explained by changes in resource availability linked to disturbance, as well as to genetic adaptations. The establishment phase is a critical period for conservation biologists and managers, given that it is during this phase that measures to eradicate or control abundance and spread are most likely to be successful. In fact, for most invasions, once an organism has arrived to a new area the opportunity for successful control is limited exclusively to this phase.",

A potential invader arrives to a new area through natural dispersal or vector-related transport. The current degree of global connectivity has intensified the frequency and velocity of organismal transport around the world. Human-related vectors may be deliberate or accidental. On arrival to a new region, successful establishment can only occur if a species is able to cope with the abiotic and biotic conditions of the environment, and the demographic variability due to small population size. Many potential invasions fail at this stage of the phenomenon, which also corresponds to the stage where eradication and control efforts are most successful. During the establishment stage (1) a species arrives to a new area, but little or no range expansion occurs. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful establishment of a species' population in a new environment (see details in Figure 2 ). Following successful establishment, individuals may disperse beyond the initial sites of introduction to colonize new areas. The subsequent movement of individuals may occur through natural dispersal or human-mediated vectors. The rate and type of range expansion may depend on life history and genetic traits that interact with environmental properties. If there is a geographical limit to available space for colonization, expansion may reach a plateau.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the successful invasion of NIS to new areas (Figures 2 and  3 ). In particular, the enemy release hypothesis proposes that NIS have an advantage over native species since the new environment may be free of antagonistic interactions (pathogens, parasites, and predators) due to a lack of evolutionary relationships with native species, which may not recognize NIS as appropriate prey or disease hosts. The biotic meltdown hypothesis states that one NIS may provoke changes in the environment that facilitate the successful establishment of subsequent NIS. The drivers and passengers hypothesis develops the idea that the establishment of introduced species in natural ecosystems may be the result of NIS-induced changes in a system, or NIS may become established as changes in the system originating from another source provide windows of opportunity for successful introduction.

For example, species that fail to establish in a community because of competition with or predation by native organisms could be favored when a previous invader reduces the abundance or diversity of native organisms. In some cases, the first NIS could be a disease that reduces the abundance of native competitors, but does not have a significant impact on the NIS. (3) The drivers and passengers hypothesis develops the idea that NIS probably plays simultaneous roles as both determinants and consequences of observed changes in natural ecosystems. Given the global extent to which human activities impact natural ecosystems, it is difficult to disentangle when the arrival of an NIS represents a main determinant of system changes and when NIS are part of a general trend in large-scale system change. The left-hand figure of the third panel indicates a system where the NIS is the driver of system change, whereas the right-hand figure illustrates how NIS occurrence in the new environment is a response to changes originating from another source (e.g., anthropogenic impacts). (4) The fourth hypothesis is based on the difference between the gross resource supply in an ecosystem and the amount of this resource that is taken up by the community. If all of the resource is used, the chance of successful establishment by NIS will be minimal. However, if community uptake is only a small fraction of the supply, availability of free resources will improve NIS success. In general, it is considered that the larger the amount of unused resources (supply-uptake), the more prone a community is to invasion. This hypothesis explains the observed increase in NIS establishment when communities present variations in resource supply, or when disturbances reduce the relative uptake of resources. In both cases the relative amount of resource that the community uptakes is reduced, leading to free resources for the new NIS.",

The diversity-invasibility hypothesis, presented by the British ecologist, Charles Elton, proposes that species-rich communities are more resistant to invasion than species-poor communities, as a greater number of native species would leave fewer 'niche opportunities' available to NIS due to interspecific competition. Empirical evaluations of this hypothesis support the existence of both positive and negative associations between native species richness and NIS colonization success, leading researchers to propose that the variation in niche opportunities over broad spatial scales, and an assumed positive relationship between native species richness and availability of niche opportunities for NIS would explain the positive relationship at broader spatial scales.",

The introduction and spread of NIS occurs as both a consequence and a cause of global change. Changes in global climate, habitat availability, biogeochemical cycles, and biodiversity can provide niche opportunities for NIS introduction and expansion. For example, studies have found that the spread of many invasive species is related to climatic variables such as temperature, disturbed habitats are less resistant to invasion, and changes in biodiversity, such as extinctions, may provide a window of opportunity for NIS to enter a system. Similarly, species invasions are considered to be a principal component of global change due to their effects on habitat, biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, economics, and human health. A notable example of the dual role of NIS is observed in the Wadden Sea of northwestern Europe (Figure 4) . In this ecosystem, food webs have been dramatically altered due to human-caused species extinctions at high trophic levels (top predators and other carnivores), combined with species introductions occurring mainly at lower trophic levels (macroplanktivores, deposit feeders, and detritovores).",

NIS-caused decreases in richness and diversity due to competition, predation, and parasitism are evidenced by the displacement and, in some cases, the extinction of native species. However, given the complex role of NIS as both causes and consequences of global change, in many cases it is a challenge to untangle the determinant role of NIS as a causal agent in species extinctions. In addition to negative effects on diversity, increases in local richness and diversity result from facilitation between NIS and native species. Such increases may include exotic 'ecosystem engineers,' which increase local species richness and abundance by providing habitat. Examples include the introduced tunicate Pyura praeputialis in Chile, which increased species richness at local and seascape scales, and the introduced green alga Codium fragile, which increased mussel recruitment and survival in the Adriatic Sea. Facilitation between exotic species (biotic meltdown) has also been observed, such as the introduction of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) in Hawaii, which are reported to spread exotic plants, reduce the abundance of some native plants through selective consumption, facilitate exotic invertebrates, and spread the invasive climbing vine Passiflora mollisima. Moreover, the spread of these feral pigs may be facilitated by introduced earthworms, which are a readily consumed source of protein by feral pigs. NIS may also present more complex, indirect effects, where one species modifies the impact that a second species has on a third. The overall effects of NIS on species diversity are varied. At smaller scales, there is evidence of both local decreases and increases in species richness associated with NIS. However, at a global scale, researchers agree that species introductions and invasions are an important threat to the planet's biodiversity. As species are moved between continents, previously dissimilar communities begin to become more alike, resulting in homogenization of the planet's biota, and the resulting loss of diversity at larger scales.",

Hybridization between introduced species and native species (and between individuals from different populations of the same species), and posterior introgression can lead to the loss of native local genotypes. Hybridization and introgression may result in sterile or less-fit populations, increasing the threat of extinction. Examples of genetic mixing include introductions of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, which hybridize extensively with native, threatened trout species (O. apache and O. gilae) in the southwestern United States and have greatly reduced the abundances of the native trout; reductions in the populations of rare, native ducks of New Zealand, Hawaii, and Florida due to hybridization with introduced mallard ducks, Anas platyrhyncho; and crop-to-wild gene flow in species such as the sugar beet, Beta vulgaris. Furthermore, hybridization and introgression can result in the origin of new variation and new species.",

For example, in South Africa the introduced mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, which has dramatically altered intertidal systems, is not considered an important food item for subsistence by local human populations, but recently this species has been recognized as a commodity for export by other stakeholders.",

Direct economic loss caused by NIS can be divided into two categories: (1) loss of potential output, such as reduction in the survival, fitness or production of crops, domesticated animals, or fisheries and (2) direct costs incurred as efforts to assuage impacts, including control, eradication and quarantine, as well as increased spending on the application of chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides to crop species, or money spent to remove or prevent the settlement of fouling organisms on shipping and aquaculture-related equipment. In the United States, the cost associated with loss or reduction in commodities due to NIS and the cost of controlling invasive species are estimated at nearly $137 billion per year. Indirect costs generated by NIS are more difficult to quantify, such as the cost of changes in biological, physical, and chemical attributes of invaded ecosystems. For example, overgrazing by introduced ungulates results in reduced plant cover and enhanced soil erosion, and exotic fish species reduce water quality due to eutrophication.",

Current NIS affecting human health include the spread of emerging diseases such as the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome on many continents and the spread of introduced West Nile virus by mosquitoes in Europe and the United States. In addition, many pathogens affect human well-being through their impacts on animal and crop species, such as the introduced foot and mouth virus in ungulates of Great Britain, and introduced soybean rust in domesticated legumes of South America. NIS that act as vectors for pathogens include the introduced mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, which has spread endemic malaria in Brazil ( Figure 6 ). Furthermore, NIS may provoke ecosystem changes that favor the outbreak of pathogens, such as the case of selective filtration of plankton by the introduced zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, in the Great Lakes of the United States, which promotes blooms of the native, toxic, blue-green alga, Microcystis sp. Other effects on human well-being include increased exposure to hazards. Examples include elevated fire risk due to invasion by the highly flammable gorse plant, Ulex europaeus; weakening of a variety of wooden structures -from boats to high-rise condominiums -by the introduced termite Coptotermes formosanus; and increased erosion of sediment banks and increased flooding due to the burrowing activity of the introduced Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis.",

Its notably high vector capacity, relative to native species, led to a malaria epidemic costing 16 000 lives before its costly eradication. Figure 6 Mosquitoes are a paradigmatic example of invasions that affect human health and economy, and in which classical components of the invasion phenomenon can be observed. In this example, the distributions of two malaria vectors (i.e., the mosquitoes Aedes albopictus and Anopheles gambiae) can be well explained by climatic and traffic data. While A. albopictus has greatly expanded its range from Asia, likely associated with shipping routes, A. gambiae has rarely spread from Africa, probably due to a lower volume of shipping traffic from this continent.

            "text": "A notable example of nonindigenous species (NIS) impacts in ecosystems as both a cause and a consequence of global change. Here the combined effects of species loss due to human-caused extinctions and species gain through introductions result in altered trophic structure of food webs in coastal marine systems of the Wadden Sea. In the trophic pyramids bar widths are scaled to the proportion of species in each trophic level and numbers indicate the percentage of species loss or gain at each trophic level. Colors indicate trophic level (white \u00bc level 1, light gray \u00bc level 2, dark gray \u00bc level 3, black \u00bc level 4). (a) Predisturbance pyramid, (b) skew of extinctions, (c) skew of invasions, (d) current distribution after invasions and extinctions resulting in 5.1% community turnover (i.e., equal numbers of extinctions and invasions), (e) projected change in the trophic distribution of species in the Wadden Sea for 25% community turnover. Since most extinctions occur at high trophic levels (top predators and other carnivores), and most invasions are from species at lower trophic levels (macroplanktivores, deposit feeders, and detritovores), the shape of the food pyramid is dramatically altered. The implications of this transformed food web on ecosystem functioning is largely unknown.
