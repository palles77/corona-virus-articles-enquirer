Congenital infections with CMV are the most common cause of neurological disorders in infants. In the United States, CMV is transmitted in 1% of all births causing death or sequala in 20% of these cases. To prevent these deaths as well as CMV infection in transplants recipient patients researchers have started to explore the possibilities for vaccination against CMV. Currently, four different CMV candidate vaccines are tested in phase I and II trials. The LA vaccine, based on the Towne strain, induced good immunity, including neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immunity, which correlate with protection. However, the immune response lagged behind that of a natural infection. To increase the immunogenicity of the Towne LA vaccine, which lacks nineteen open reading frames (ORF) and lost its capacity to establish latency, some of the ORF of the more virulent Toledo strain of CMV will be introduced into the Towne vaccine strain. In addition to these two candidate LA vaccines, a sub-unit candidate vaccine comprising of the gB glycoprotein and a canarypox vector containing the pp65 and IEI exon 4 are being tested in phase I trials. The former induces antibodies, whereas the latter induces a strong cellular immune response.",

Because of the reduced immune function, vaccine efficacies are often lower in the elderly and vaccines have to be more immunogenic to obtain similar seroconversion rates. Michael Roggendorf (University of Essen, Essen, Germany) showed that the immunogenicity of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine is lower in the elderly, as was measured by seroconversion rates [4] . Interestingly, the efficacy of the HAV and HBV vaccine differed in individuals over 60 years of age, (71 and 37.5% seroconversion, respectively), which may be dependent on the nature of the vaccine formulations. Lluis Salleras (Autonomous Government of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain) further elaborated on vaccine efficacy and demonstrated that HAV and HBV vaccination in pre-adolescent schoolchildren was >90% effective in protection from disease [5] .",

This work was done using human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a virus causing similar disease as RSV. Exchanging the polymerase genes between the two different lineages of hMPV attenuated the ability to induce chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity from a mini-genome containing a CAT reporter gene flanked by the hMPV genomic ends. Using the full-length hMPV genome instead of a reporter gene resulted in the rescue of recombinant viable viruses [7] .

Flumist TM is applied intranasally, has been shown to be effective and has a low transmission rate in highly susceptible young children in a day care setting. In the future, the medical importance of a possible association between asthma and the use of Flumist TM in young children needs to be investigated.

Monkeys are permissive for infection with dengue virus, but they do not show any disease symptoms, including DHF or DSS. Upon infection these animals clear the virus and develop antibodies that are partially cross-protective. At present it is unclear whether the monkey model is valid for predicting the outcome of vaccination in humans [16] . Seroconversion rates of mono-and tetravalent candidate vaccines were generally lower in humans than in monkeys. The DEN-4 30 and the ChimeriVax TM -D2 (A recombinant YF virus containing the prM and envelop (E) protein of dengue virus serotype 2) candidate vaccines elicited seroconversion rates in humans of >95%. The Walter Reed group has conducted a serotype 1 dengue (DEN-1) and serotype 3 dengue (DEN-3) virus challenge study of subjects vaccinated with their tetravalent LA candidate vaccine. Results indicated that the rhesus monkey viremia correlated well with results in humans. Although the human challenge model is important in validating vaccine efficacies, its role in vaccine development remains to be defined.",

Finally, reinfections with coronaviruses occur frequently, suggesting that pre-existing immunity is easily overcome by the virus. The construction of a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the full-length transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) allowed genetic manipulation of the virus [24] . It was shown that an E-protein deficient TGEV virus can only replicate on packaging cell-lines expressing the E-protein [25] .

These vectors can induce strong humoral and cellular immune responses specific for the protein of interest. Gerd Sutter (GSF-Institute of Molecular Virology, Muenchen, Germany) elaborated on progress made with regard to the development of MVA vector technologies. MVA can be used under conditions of biosafety level 1 because of its avirulence and its deficiency to productively grow in human cells. In animal models, MVA vaccines have been found immunogenic and protective against various infectious agents including immunodeficiency viruses. Here, data from a clinical trial were presented providing evidence for safety and immunogenicity of recombinant MVA when used as therapeutic vaccine in HIV-infected individuals [27] . Finally, it was shown that modification of immune regulatory genes, such as interferon resistance genes or interleukin-inhibitor sequences conserved within the MVA genome, might provide the basis for the development of advanced second generation MVA vaccines with even higher immunogenicity [28, 29] .",

In monkeys, inclusion of the envelop gene in the candidate vaccine (plasmid DNA-recombinant adenovirus prime-boost regiment) enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses which correlated with immune protection [37] . Using high doses of plasmid DNA (4-8 milligram), HIV-specific T-cell responses were induced in a high percentage of individuals. One of the mysteries of HIV is the transmission of CCR5-tropic viruses, and not CXCR4-tropic viruses, upon infection. New data demonstrated that the CCR5-tropic viruses can infect immature DC, whereas CXCR4-tropic viruses cannot. These immature DC can, upon maturation, mediate viral transfer to CD4+ T cells. Since this whole process is done within cells, it is highly resistant to neutralizing antibody activity. This mechanism may contribute to preferential transmission of CCR5-tropic viruses and may have implications for future vaccine design.",

Rotavirus is an important pathogen of young children claiming half a million deaths each year, in particular in developing countries. Rotavirus is a complex triple layered virus with two neutralizing antigens, which are involved in the immune response of the host. Vaccine strategies differ in the need for the development of homo-and heterotypic immunity to these specific antigens. Currently, two LA rotavirus vaccines are licensed. Rotashield \u00ae (Wyeth Vaccines), a tetravalent rhesus rotavirus vaccine, demonstrated 70% protection against all rotavirus diarrhea and more than 90% against severe disease. However 25% of the vaccinees developed fever upon vaccination and there was an elevated risk of developing intussusception in 1/10,000 vaccinees. For this reason Rotashield \u00ae as a vaccine has been withdrawn. The second LA rotavirus vaccine is manufactured in China, although it efficacy in truly na\u00efve children remains to be demonstrated.",

The GP is an important vaccine candidate, however passive transfer of antibodies in both humans and monkeys did not confer protection from infection. Vaccination experiments are therefore aiming at the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses to Ebola virus.

This may have been due to the relatively late peak in virus-titers (day 10-16 after onset of illness), subjecting these health care workers with high doses of virus. The relatively late peak in virus titers has also hampered the diagnosis of SARS-CoV.
