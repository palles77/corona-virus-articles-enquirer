            "text": "There is great interest in the antibodies-to-DNA transformation, since this change is characteristic of autoimmune diseases and contributes to its pathology. After immunization and fusions, 14 hybridomas bearing DNA-hydrolysis activity against pUC19 plasmid DNA were obtained. Genes coding for V H and V L regions of the 14 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were cloned and sequenced. The sequences were compared with sequences of the Ig-Blast database to determine their germline and to identify potential mutations responsible for DNA binding and DNase activity. V genes of the H chains' genes expressed four genes of the V H 1/J558 family, three of V H 5/V H 7183, and three of V H 8/V H 3609. The genetic repertoire of these mAbs was examined by determining the nucleotide sequences of their H chain V regions. This V H and V L domain was most similar to an anti-ssDNA (DNA-1) antibody as well as to catalytic autoimmune mAb (m3D8). Computer-generated models of the three-dimensional structures of V H and V L (VHL4) of the IgG4 combinations were used to define the positions occupied by the important sequence motifs at the binding sites. The modeling structure showed that VHL4 binds to oligo (dT3) primarily by sandwiching thymine bases between Tyr L32, Tyr L49 and Tyr H97 side-chains. Superposing VHL4 with anti-nucleic acid m3D8 catAbs revealed a common ssDNA recognition module consisting of His L93, His H35 residues which are critical for DNA-hydrolyzing antibodies. This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of the protein DNA surrogate in the investigation of the origin of anti-DNA antibodies' hydrolyzing activities.",

            "text": "Catalytic antibodies (catAbs) were first obtained in 1986 [1, 2] against transition state analogs. Amidase and peptidase activities were found in IgGs from the sera of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [3] , factor VIII-cleaving allo-Abs in the sera of patients with severe hemophilia [4] , and DNA-hydrolyzing, amidolytic and peptidolytic activities in Bence-Jones proteins from patients with multiple myeloma [5] . The multiple myeloma patients of an Ab light chain that cleaves the human immunodeficiency virus protein gp120 demonstrated that natural Abs are not restricted to autoantigenic substrates [6] . Anti-DNA antibodies play an impor- tant role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in humans [7] . It has been reported that some of the catAbs to DNA found in SLE patients have nuclease activity and catalyze hydrolysis of the DNA phosphodiester bond [7] . A natural catAbs was prepared by the immunization of mice with ground-state polypeptides or proteins such as Ab light chain-specific vasoactive intestinal peptide which has peptidase hydrolytic activity [8] . Also immunizing mice by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 gp41 polypeptide-stimulated Ab light chain enzymatically cleaved the conserved region of the HIV-1 envelope protein as well as the antigenic gp41 peptide [9] . Sequence analysis of anti-DNA mAbs from both patients with SLE and murine models of the disease showed that these high-affinity anti-dsDNA IgG contain a high proportion of somatic mutations in their V H and V L sequences [10, 11] . In many of these high-affinity anti-dsDNA IgG Abs, such somatic mutations lead to higher frequencies of certain amino acids, particularly arginine, asparagine, lysine, and tyrosine in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). It has been suggested that the structures of these amino acids allow them to form electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds with the negatively charged DNA phosphodiester backbone [11] . The aim of this work was to study mAbs and their DNA-hydrolyzing activities. The reactivity of the mAbs, to hydrolyse DNA, was intriguing enough to prompt us to further study their fine specificity and their catalytic mechanisms by analyzing the molecular sequence and structure of the V H and V L genes. Molecular modeling for stimulation with DNA catAb (m3D8) for predicting the catalytic mechanism of the variable region of mAb-4 (4 FV) and knowledge of the specific immunoglobulin genes used to target a common epitope may potentially be useful to identify protein DNA mimicry in the investigation of the origin of anti-DNA Abs catalytic activities.",

To prove that hydrolyzing activity is an intrinsic property of mAbs and is not due to copurifying enzymes, we applied some of the rigid criteria that have been previously proposed by Paul et al. [18] and regarding several aspects for high purity Abs as suggested by Nevinsky and Buneva [19] . Basically, three common steps (purification, precipitated with ammonium sulphate, and affinity chromatography) were used to remove non-specifically bound protein buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.15 M NaCl, followed by gel filtration, which resulted in Abs with a preparation purity of >99% [15] .",

These sequences were almost homologous with corresponding germline genes published in the GenBank database, outlined in Table 1 , which summarizes the V H , D, and J H fragments of V H genes, and V and J of V L genes. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the expressed light chain germline gene were confidently assigned to a very restricted germline family V2, gene bd2 (10 mAbs), GenBank accession nos. (EF672211, EF672212, EF672213, EF672214, EF672215, EF672216, EF672217, EF672218, EF672219, and EF672220; Table 1 ). Four Abs belonged to germline family V1A, gene bb1.1. GenBank accession nos. (EF672221, EF672222, EF672223, and EF672224; Table 1 ). The identity of the V genes used was determined by searching the GenBank database for homologies to known V genes using the BLAST protocol [20] . Alternatively, the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the expressed V H genes of the 14 anti-CMV Abs are shown in Fig. 1 (Table 1 ). In addition, the V H genes of the IgG Abs were more somatically mutated. D segment usage also appears to be restricted with 7 mAbs of V H using the DSP2 segment, while 3 mAbs were used for another segment, DFL16 ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). On the other hand, it does not appear to be an obvious restriction in J H segment usage. Interestingly, most Abs could group into three sets based on their use of the same or highly similar V H and V L genes [21] . Gene rearrangement entails the joining of V H , D and J H germline genes followed by the joining of V L and J L genes. The heavy chains belong to three different families classified into three subgroups. The first includes four mAbs (4, 9, 11, and 521 ) and belongs to the V H J558 germline family with different genes; the homology of the amino acid sequences are V H 104B (99%), V H J558.45 (94%), V H J558.51 (89%) and V H J558.51 (93%) [22, 23] (Fig. 1E , F, G, respectively). However, the V H genes belong to germline family V H J558, gene V130.3, with 97, 97, 95, and 94% identity, respectively (Fig. 1B) [24] . D segments belong to DSP2.11 combined with J H 2 ( Table 1 ). The second subgroup includes three mAbs-(5, 8, and 52) ( Fig. 1C and D) whose V H gene segments are from the V H 7183 germline family [25] . The mAbs-(5 and 52) V H genes are derived from the same germline gene V H 7183.14 with 97 and 95% amino acid homology, respectively (Fig. 1D ) [26] . The third subgroup includes mAbs-(6, 7, and 122) V H genes which are derived from the same V H 3609 germline family, CB17H.10 gene [25] with 96, 96, and 95% homology, respectively ( Fig. 1A) (Table 1) .",

All 10 Abs use a V L region encoded by V 2-J1 or -J2 recombination; in addition, the Tyr residue was more frequently observed in 8 mAbs at the V-J joint (V L 96). This residue is encoded by J2, while the Gln residue was observed twice at position V L 96 while the Trp residue was observed once at the same position, V L 96. Interestingly, the V L 34 residue is an Asn germline code VII bd2 germline gene which is typical to Abs V L -specific CMV-CP while the V L -(4, 6, and 7), V L 34 Asn residue was substituted with Ser (Asn34Ser) (Fig. 3A) . Moreover, the V L gene was very restricted against CMV-CP, with high homology to numerous and different Abs raised against autoimmune diseases (anti-DNA, -RNA, -Sm, and -histone) as well as some human viruses (HIV-Gp41 and p24; Hepatitis B and C virus), and catAb proteolytic light chain, esterase-like catAb, and Ab catalysis of the cationic cyclization reaction (Fig. 3A) . Four Abs used another VIA-J4 (Fig. 3B ) which revealed high homology with the light chain against different specific antigens whose identity varied from 94 to 98% with light chains from the database i.e., influenza hemagglutinin neutralizing Ab, anti-ssDNA, -RNA, -fluorescein,polysaccharide, and -bisphenol-A (Fig. 3B) suggesting an intrinsic polyspecificity associated with the V L . In fact, V1 is common to a relatively large population of Abs that bind a large number of antigens, including proteins, DNA, steroids, peptides, and small haptens [37] . Thus, the polyspecificity intrinsic to V1 may contribute to the ability of the germline repertoire to bind to a wide array of chemical structures.",

The relative activity of mAbs against pUC19 DNA Indeed, there are numerous reports regarding natural catAbs but databases of the germline sequence are actually rare and the catalytic domain is mostly revealed from the V L gene while the germline genes VIA bb1.1 and VII bd2 have been reported to possess DNase peptidase-like activity, respectively. Particularly, the Abs derived from germline gene VII bd2 showed higher relative activity than that derived from germline gene VIA bb1 (Fig. 4) . Furthermore, the relative DNAse catalytic activity might depend on the V H germline. In this case, in the presence of Mg 2+ , most mAbs showed high DNA catalytic activity within a varying pH range (Fig. 4) . Alternatively, the mAbs showed only a single break in linear DNA at pH 7-10 in the absence of Mg 2+ (Fig. 4B, D, F, H, and L) . In contrast, polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) illustrated a very restricted pH range, 7-7.5 ( Fig. 4I and G) . mAbs 5 and 6 revealed the disappearance of DNA in the presence of Mg 2+ (Fig. 4C and E) while mAbs 4 and M2-4 showed less activity than mAb-5 and -6 ( Fig. 4A and  G) . Notably, incubation of mAbs with CMV, polyglutamic acid, and dextrin sulphate efficiently inhibited DNase catalytic activity [15] . Remarkably, mAbs having different V H combining ability with one V L showed different DNase catalytic activity; therefore, we speculate that V H could increase or decrease catalytic activity depending on the germline genes ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ).",

The V L and V H sequences of the IgG4 Ab share a very high level of identity with known Abs for which a crystal structure has been reported [38] . Superposition of homology modeled 4-FV structure with the crystal structure of m3D8 scFv (PDB 2GKI) [38] . The alpha carbon traces of V H and V L domains of m3D8 and 4 are displayed in the indicated color code. Two critical residues for the catalysis (HisH35 and HisL93) with a similar orientation of key residues, potentially implied in the catalysis, were observed (Fig. 5 ) and putative DNA binding residues (Tyr residues at L32, L49, and H97) are highlighted as a stick model. The images were generated using PyMol software (DeLano Scientific LLC). The 3D structure similarity, added to the ability of 4-FV to hydrolyze DNA, suggest that the active sites of both catalysts probably have structural similarities. Superposition of the active sites of 4-FV to predict the binding site with the active sites of anti-DNA (m3D8) Ab indicates that Tyr [L32, L49 (green) and H97 (brown)] residues of 4-FV are equidistant to Tyr [L32, L49, L92 (turquoise), H97, and H100a (pink)] residues of the DNA catalytic m3D8 Ab (Fig. 6) . Furthermore, superposition of the active sites of 4-FV with the active sites of anti-ssDNA (DNA-1) Abs indicates that Tyr [L32, L49, and L92 (turquoise)], Tyr [H97, Fig. 6 .

H100 and H100a (pink)] residues binding with dT3 (brown) are at similar distances to Tyr [L32, L49 (green), and H97 (brown)] (Fig. 7) . The structure shows that Ab binds oligo(dT) primarily by sandwiching thymine bases between Tyr side-chains, which allows the bases to make sequence-specific hydrogen bonds (Figs. 6 and 7 ). The 3D model is assessed by simulation of molecular dynamics to determine its stability and by comparison with those of known protein structures. The structural information from the theoretically modeled complex can help us to further understand the catalytic mechanism of anti-DNA Abs.",

            "text": "Using data from known Ab crystal structures and computer modeling, a series of linkers were designed and evaluated as potential candidates to genetically connect the V H and V L regions. The resulting scFv molecules were evaluated for their functional activities and relative affinity [39] . Very little molecular characterization of natural catalytic Abs with mAbs has been achieved so far. Due to the activation of the immune system as a response to a foreign antigen, maturation of the Ab response takes place, resulting in the production of specific, high-affinity Abs. Therefore, specific Abs can be selected using a relatively small, random combinatorial V gene library derived from an immunized donor [40] . The procedure included the isolation of the V H and V L of the murine mAb from mRNA of 14 hybridoma cells, followed by cloning, sequencing and characterization of the FV. V H gene usage was determined and compared to V H genes used by Ab fragments of a germline database. The V H and V regions of 14 anti-CMV mAbs generated from five different fusions of BALB/c mice were immunized with native CMV-CP, and the V H , D, J H , V, and J were determined ( Table 1 ). All the Abs were derived from distinct B cells because they had utilized diverse V H , D, and J H gene combinations, and because the length of the CDR3 region ranged from 7 to 17 amino acid residues (Table 2 ). An abundance of V H genes from the J558 family was observed (8/14) but each represented a separate member of the family ( Table 1 ). The V L is encoded by the V1 gene, which is common to a relatively large population of Abs that bind a large number of antigens including proteins, DNA, steroids, pep-tides, and small haptens [37] . Certain combinations of germline V genes (V, J and V H ) are polyspecific in nature and can be used to construct Ab-combining sites for structurally very distinct ligands. Germline Ab polyspecificity further expands the binding potential of the germline repertoire [37] . This polyspecificity may be general to several germline-encoded Abs and may have been selected for by the immune system to provide a mechanism for rapid generation of Abs of moderate to high affinity for a broad range of antigens [37] . CMV-CP is capable of inducing a variety of B cells that have distinct phenotypic and genotypic paratopes. Interestingly, the high DNase catalytic Abs were encoded by germline genes such as mAb-8 (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, analysis of DNase catalytic activities and nucleotide sequences of the V H and V L showed a strong correlation with the germline heavy chains, in which mAb-(8) was derived from V H 7183, showing high DNase catalytic activity ( Fig. 4K and L) . Prominently, the result of the relative activity of the six different mAbs (4, 5, 6 and 8) showed diverse relative activities, although their light chain genes had high relative identity; therefore, the fact that V H domain can modulate catalytic activity is potentially important in these mAbs (Fig. 4) . One of the important aspects of V L and V H amino acid sequences is the study of the structural analysis of the antigen-binding loops by molecular modeling and simulation of molecular dynamics. Through these findings, amino acid His (H35 and L93) residues may play a crucial role in the DNA-Ab interaction (Fig. 5) . Tyr (L32, L49 and H97) side-chains that exist in the antigen combining site might be capable of mediating most of the contacts necessary for DNA recognition, and thus it seems likely that the overabundance of Tyr in natural antigen-binding sites is a consequence of the side chain being particularly well suited for making productive contacts with antigen [41] . Interestingly, the genes encoding the heavy chain variable region of these Abs displayed evidence of only minimal somatic hypermutation (Fig. 1C) . We consider that the negative charge on the acetate group in the CMV-CP was partially neutralized by a hydrogen bond with the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine, which exists in HCDR3. Therefore, we speculate and expect that the HCDR3-peptide be used as tool for plant virus resistance depending on the peptide-neutralizing epitope.",
