On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count.

Indeed, multiple organ involvements including the liver, gastrointestinal tract and kidney have been reported during the course of SARS in 2003 8 and COVID-19 9 . Of note, the high prevalence of kidney impairment at baseline may be explained by the fact that many COVID-19 patients couldn't be admitted to hospital in the early stage of disease outbreak because of large number of patients and limited beds in hospital in Wuhan. In addition, another explanation is that some COVID-19 patients may have a past history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CKD patients have a proinflammatory milieu and functional defects in innate and adaptive immune cell populations 10 . In a community-based cohort of nearly 10,000 adult individuals, reduced eGFR and elevated albumin creatinine ratio were associated with higher risk for hospitalization with infection and subsequent mortality 11 . Furthermore, CKD patients have a higher risk for upper respiratory tract infection 12 and pneumonia 13 .",

Importantly, the present method of detecting AKI is mainly based on changes in Scr and the frequency of Scr tests has a substantial impact on the detection rate of AKI 17 . In a nationwide cross-sectional survey of hospitalized adult patients in China, the detection rate of AKI was only 0.99% by KDIGO criteria 18 . After adjusting for frequency of Scr, the incidence of AKI in Chinese hospitalized adults gave rise to 11.6% 19 .
