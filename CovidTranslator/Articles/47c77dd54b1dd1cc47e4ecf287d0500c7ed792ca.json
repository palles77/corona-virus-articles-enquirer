As of Feb. 5, there 5 were a total of 3,711 individuals with 2,666 passengers and 1,045 crew members on board the DP. The Japanese government has asked about 3,600 passengers and crew members to stay on board in Yokohama during the 14-day isolation period through Feb. 19 to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 cases.

RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive for 148 individuals (138 passengers, 9 crew members, and 1 quarantine officer), indicating that the positivity rate was 16.4% (147 positive individuals [excluding the officer] / 895 subjects).

In total 70 WGSs have been determined. The Cq limit for successful genome sequence determination was around 32 (Fig. 1A) , which corresponds to a virus copy number of less than 300. The 73 genome sequences (including 3 sequences of DP isolates deposited in GISAID) were compared with the Wuhan-Hu-1 (isolated on Dec. 26, 2020 in China) genome sequence as a reference. The frequencies of single nucleotide variations 30 (SNVs) suggested that all 73 isolates shared a single nucleotide variation: the G nucleotide at the 11,083 position on the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome sequence was mutated to T (G11083T transversion) leading to a non-synonymous amino acid substitution (Leu37Phe) in the nsp6 protein (Fig. 1B) . Some additional minor SNVs were identified throughout the genome sequence.",

Pyrimidine transition, in particular cytosine (C) to thymine (T), makes up a large portion of the SNVs, suggesting that hydrolytic deamination of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine residues in DNA appears to contribute significantly to the appearance of spontaneous mutations (6) . On the other 40 hand, transversion most likely occurs at a low rate, but the guanine (G) to thymine (T) transversion in particular has been observed in both DP isolates and other SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Fig. 1C) . Naturally generated reactive oxygen alters guanine to 8-oxo-guanine (8oxoG), causing significant destabilization of the 8oxoG and C base pair (7), implying that G to T transversion is one of possible driving forces generating SARS-CoV-2 variants.

            "text": "Haplotype networks from genomic SNVs (HN-GSNVs) were used to map the genotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates that disseminated in the DP cruise ship after isolation of the passengers on 5 Feb. 5. In addition to identifying the genetic alterations, we generated HN-GSNVs to highlight the clonality of DP isolates compared with other SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences which are publicly available on GISAID (update as of March 10, 2020). Analysis clearly suggested that the DP cluster had been generated from the potential haplotype ancestor of the global pandemic, Wuhan-Hu-1 haplotype, by G11083T transversion before initial dissemination in the DP ( Fig. 2A , 10 and see Supplementary Table S2 for SNVs). Thus far, all DP isolates identified have been rooted on a single brunch of the HN-GSNVs map ( Fig. 2A) , showing different genealogy to other isolates in China, Europe, North America, and an outbreak on another cruise ship reported from the USA. The finding that all isolates in the DP cluster exhibit G11083T transversion strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 dissemination in the DP could have originated from a single 15 introduction event before the quarantine started on Feb. 3. Further focusing of the HN-GSNVs map on only the DP isolates in the cluster revealed that the 29 isolates of the DP-A cluster (indicated A in Fig. 2B ) predominated among the DP isolates, indicating that the DP-A cluster is the ancestral haplotype for subsequent transmission. Based on the estimated speed of SARS-CoV-2 evolution (temporal resolution assumes a nucleotide substitution rate of 8 \u00d7 10 -4 subs per 20 site per year among the 528 SARS-CoV-2 WGSs, described at the Nextstrain web site for realtime tracking of pathogen evolution [update as of March 16, 2020] (8), one mutation per genome occurs in every 15 days in average, suggesting that predominant isolates in the DP-A cluster could be a very early generation of progeny from Wuhan-Hu-1 isolated on Dec. 26, 2020. This predomination of the DP-A cluster might explain the large epidemics within the cruise ship; it is 25 possible that super-spreading occurred immediately after introduction of the virus, well before the quarantine starting on Feb. 3. This super-spreading may have originated from the COVID-19 patient who had disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan. 25. Although further explosive spreading might have been prevented after the quarantine, some of the subsequent progeny clusters, including DP-B (5 isolates) and DP-C (6 isolates) (Fig. 2B) , may have formed via transmission 30 through hidden links, such as eating at the same dinner table. Additionally, 33 patients (45%) not included in the DP-A, -B and -C clusters were revealed to have unique SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes with patient-specific unique SNVs and/or deletions. The finding of such unique progenies might explain how further subsequent minor spreading occurred after the quarantine. Indeed, the haplotype network suggests the existence of direct transmissions among passengers who shared 35 same cabins during the quarantine; three cabin mates had been infected by the virus with same haplotype (two pairs in DP-A cluster, and one pair in other cluster), and 5 pairs shared haplotypes linked by a single SNV (A to DP0290, A to DP0481, A to DP0645, A to DP0803, and DP0764 to DP0765).",
