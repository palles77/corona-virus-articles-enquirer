The interface formed a conserved hydrophobic cavity suitable for targeted drug screening. By considering the hydrophobic complementarity during the virtual screening step, we identified 5benzyloxygramine as a new N protein PPI orthosteric stabilizer that exhibits both antiviral and N-NTD protein-stabilizing activities. X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering showed that 5-benzyloxygramine stabilizes the N-NTD dimers through simultaneous hydrophobic interactions with both partners, resulting in abnormal N protein oligomerization that was further confirmed in the cell. This unique approach based on the identification and stabilization of non-native PPIs of N protein could be applied toward drug discovery against CoV diseases.",

            "text": "Small-molecule stabilization of protein\u2212protein interactions (PPIs) is an extremely promising strategy in drug discovery. It can be used to treat cancers and viral infections. 1\u22123 Stabilizing PPIs with small molecules may be allosteric or direct (also called orthosteric). This process alters the oligomerization equilibrium of the protein and enables small molecules to modulate its physiological function. 4\u22127 The anticancer drug paclitaxel, for example, allosterically enhances microtubule structure assembly by binding to \u03b2-tubulin. 8, 9 On the other hand, rapamycin, another anticancer agent, binds directly to the interface between FKBP12 and mTOR and stabilizes the structure of the complex. 10 The most well-characterized PPIs suitable as targets for drug development form natively under physiological conditions. However, non-native interactions, which may form under extreme circumstances such as inside a crystal lattice, are also potential drug targets. For example, nucleozin exerts its antiviral activity by stabilizing the non-native PPI interface between the two neighboring nucleoprotein trimers within the influenza virus, which results in abnormal protein oligomerization and loss of viral viability. 11 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) belongs to the betacoronavirus (\u03b2-CoVs) family. It causes severe respiratory distress with a high mortality rate in humans. 12\u221214 Recently, a closely related novel coronavirus, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , caused an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, which further underscored the risk of CoVs to the global public health. 15, 16 However, there is no effective treatment for CoVs. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new antiviral agents against CoVs. 14,17 MERS-CoV packages its genome in a nucleocapsid (N) protein and forms a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The RNP is essential for viral transcription and assembly. Several studies suggested that the modulation of CoV N protein oligomerization by small molecules is a feasible antiviral drug development strategy. 18, 19 The CoV N protein is organized into the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), with both domains participating in RNA binding. 20, 21 All CoV N-NTD structures are folded in a monomeric conformation. In contrast, the CoV N-CTDs are always dimeric and are responsible for N protein oligomerization via protein\u2212protein interactions. 22, 23 Here, we report the crystal structure of MERS-CoV N-NTD in a non-native dimeric configuration. We used the non-native dimer interface as the target in virtual screening for an orthosteric stabilizer. To this end, we considered the binding scores and hydrophobic complementarity of the acquired poses, and further selected the potential leads P1\u2212P3 from Acros and ZINC drug databases. Of these, only 5-benzyloxygramine (P3) had both antiviral and stabilizing activities on the N protein. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cell-based assays showed that P3 induces abnormal full-length N protein oligomerization in vitro and at the cell level. We also described the structure of MERS-CoV N-NTD complexed with 5benzyloxygramine and revealed its stabilizing mechanism. Our findings provide insight into the development of a new therapeutic approach based on stabilizing a non-native protein interaction interface. It may lead to the discovery and development of new treatments for various infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Structure of the N-Terminal Domain of the MERS-CoV N Protein. We determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV N-NTD by molecular replacement (MR) using the structure of HCoV-OC43 N-NTD (PDB ID: 4J3K) as the search model. 24 The final structure was refined to R-factor and R-free values of 0.26 and 0.29, respectively, at a resolution of 2.6 \u00c5 (Table S1 ). Each asymmetric unit contained four N-NTD molecules assembled into two identical dimers with an overall RMSD of 0.28 \u00c5 between the dimers ( Figure S1A ,B). The monomers shared a similar structural core preceded by a flexible region ( Figure S1D ). The core consisted of a fivestranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet sandwiched between loops arranged in a right-handed, fist-shaped structure conserved Interactions among MERS-CoV N-NTDs. Dimerization is mediated mainly by vector-fusion residues interacting with the conserved hydrophobic regions on the core structure (first area) along with the residues surrounding it (second area). Interacting residues on monomers 1 and 2 are labeled in black and blue, respectively. Vector-fusion and conserved hydrophobic regions are colored cyan and red, respectively. The color of all other interacting residues is the same as that for each monomer in (A). Polar contacts are indicated with red dashed lines. (C) Upper panel: closeup of the interacting region of vector-fusion residues. The surface was colored according to the hydrophobicity level at the protein surface. Vectorfusion residues (black) are shown as sticks to emphasize the hydrophobic pocket. Lower panel: 2D diagrams of the interaction between the hydrophobic pocket and the vector-fusion residues. The latter are labeled in black. The hydrophobic contacts are indicated with black dashed lines. (D) Sequence alignment of various CoV N proteins in the N-terminal region. Red letters indicate strictly conserved residues. Cyan indicates conservative substitution sites. Hydrophobic regions involved in unusual dimerization are indicated by black triangles. among the CoVs. 25 In our structure, however, the loop connecting strands \u03b22 and \u03b23 protruding out of the core into other CoV N proteins was absent. Unlike the reported structures that have a monomeric conformation, our structure was atypically dimeric. Figure 1B shows the details of the interactions in the MERS-CoV N protein dimer. We named the units monomer 1 and monomer 2 ( Figure 1A ). According to the amino acid composition of the binding site on monomer 2, we divided the dimeric interface into two areas: one located on the Nterminus flexible region and the other on the loop between \u03b24 and \u03b25 of the N protein. In the first area, W43, N66, N68, Y102, and F135 of monomer 1 generated a conserved hydrophobic pocket permitting the side chain of M38 of monomer 2 to enter this hole by a hydrophobic contact ( Figure 1C ,D). H37 and N39 of monomer 2 were packed against W43 and F135 of monomer 1, respectively, and contributed to the hydrophobic interaction. The side chains of N39 of monomer 2 formed one hydrogen bond with the N68 backbone in monomer 1 at a distance of 2.6 \u00c5. The second area was relatively more hydrophilic. The main chain oxygens of G104, F135, and T137 of monomer 2 formed three hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Q73 and T134 of monomer 1 at distances of 3.8, 3.2, and 3.7 \u00c5, respectively. The side chain of N139 on monomer 2 formed a hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen of T137 on monomer 1 at a distance of 3.6 \u00c5. The interactions of the first and second areas comprise buried surface areas (BSA) of 289 and 103 \u00c5 2 , respectively. The small surface area buried at the interface accounts for \u223c5 kcal mol \u22121 binding energy, 26 which translates to a dissociation constant of \u223c200 mM. Thus, the dimer described here is unique in that it is non-native and relies on vector-fusion residues (H37 and M38) to maintain its dimeric status. This property may also explain why the present structure has an oligomeric status different from previously reported structures for the CoV N protein. 24,27\u221230 We used cross-linking experiments to analyze the oligomeric capacity of MERS N-NTD containing the vector-fusion residues in solution. MERS N-NTD had a dimeric conformation in solution. Our structure indicated that W43 played an essential role in forming the hydrophobic pocket accommodating the vector-fusion residues and, therefore, mediated the N-NTD dimer formation. The W43A mutation significantly reduced the oligomeric tendency of N-NTD ( Figure S1C ). This further supports that the \"exogenous residues\" encoded by the vector backbone mediated the formation of the non-native dimer. We also superimposed the previously published structure of MERS-CoV N-NTD (PDB ID: 4ud1) 27 containing a native N-terminal flexible region with our dimer structure. The side chain of N38 in the native structure could not interact with the hydrophobic pocket as the former is hydrophilic and short ( Figure S1E ). Thus, it may be possible to utilize small compounds to replace the vector-fusion residues and stabilize the PPI through hydrophobic interactions.",

We performed a structure-based virtual screening by targeting W43 in the hydrophobic pocket of the N-NTD dimeric interface. H37 and M38 were removed from the template to identify compounds that could replace the vector-fusion residues and, therefore, contribute to the stabilizing effect (Figures 2A and S2A,B) . We chose the highest-scoring hits, listed in Table S2 , based on shape complementarity, the presence of aromatic moieties, and the ability to stack onto W43 of N-NTD. Because the formation of the non-native dimers was primarily mediated by hydrophobic interactions in our structure ( Figure 1C ,D), we next considered the hydrophobic complementarity between the acquired ligands and N-NTD in the form of the lipophilic match surface (S L/L ). 31 We also took into account the ability of the drug to permeate cells by aiming for lower topological polar surface areas (TPSA). Based on the above criteria, three compounds were finally chosen for further study. Benzyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1-indolinecarboxylate (P1) and 5-benzyloxygramine (P3) had higher S L/L and docking scores and lower TPSA. The clinical drug etodolac (P2) had a comparable S L/L but a lower docking score. It too was selected as a candidate. However, only P3 induced a comparatively larger blue shift in the intrinsic N-NTD fluorescence spectrum, indicating that the microenvironment surrounding the tryptophans of the protein increased in rigidity and hydrophobicity in the presence of P3. 32 The result also indicated that P3 bound more tightly to the N protein than P1 or P2 by interacting with the W43 pocket ( Figure 2B ). Fluorescent thermal stability assays disclosed that the N-NTD denaturation melting temperature had increased from 42 to 45\u00b0C when P3 was added. The sigmoidal melting curve for MERS-CoV N-NTD changed in the presence of P3. The delay in protein denaturation suggests that P3 stabilized the MERS-CoV N-NTD dimer structure ( Figure 2C ). We then measured the cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) and effective concentration (EC 50 ) for each compound using Vero E6 cells infected with MERS-CoV. Table 1 shows that P3 had a favorable therapeutic index among the lead compounds tested in this study. Therefore, P3 is an excellent candidate inhibitor against MERS-CoV.",

Instead, we used rigid body modeling of the SAXS data with the N-terminal domain (NTD; solved in this study) and the C-terminal domains (CTD, PDB ID: 6G13). 23 In this way, we obtained structural models for the free N protein and its complex with P3 ( Figure 3B ,C). Excellent fits were obtained. Representative structural models for the full-length protein without and with P3 are shown in Figure 3D ,E, respectively. The free N protein formed a tetramer through CTD with the NTD freely hanging in solution ( Figure 3D ). The conformation of the solution was consistent with structures previously reported for other CoV N proteins. 33 The N-P3 complex formed a compact hexadecamer with a sunburst configuration ( Figure 3E ). The CTDs formed a central ring and non-native NTD dimers formed \"spikes\" protruding from the ring. Consistent with ligand-induced aggregation, we observed a \"blue shift\" in the fluorescence spectrum of the full-length MERS-CoV N protein in the presence of P3 ( Figure 3F ). The addition of P3 also delayed N protein thermal denaturation and changed the shape of the denaturation curve, further suggesting that large protein aggregates formed in the presence of P3 ( Figure 3G ). The structure explains how N-NTD dimerization decreased MERS-CoV viability. The N protein packages the viral genome into an RNP complex. Several models for N-CTD dimer assembly have been proposed for the formation of filamentous RNPs. 33 All of the proposed interfaces between N-CTD dimers occurred on the side-faces of the CTD cuboid perpendicular to the proposed RNA-binding surface ( Figure 3H ). Combinatorial use of any region on the side-faces of the CTD dimer cuboid may facilitate manipulation of the RNP length and curvature without obstructing the RNA-binding surface. 28, 34 However, the SAXS results indicated that N-CTD aggregation occurred on the \u03b2-sheet floor of the CTD cuboid. For this reason, the RNA-binding surface of the CTD is occluded by the neighboring CTD on the ring and by the non-native NTD dimer making direct contact with the CTD (Figures 3H and  S3 ). In addition, the CTD cuboids in the aggregation naturally form a topologically closed octamer, leaving no open ends for further addition of CTD cuboids to form a long filamentous RNP. Both the loss of the RNA-binding surface and the inability to incorporate further N protein molecules beyond an octamer may inhibit the formation of the RNP. Therefore, P3 may inhibit MERS-CoV RNP formation by inducing N protein aggregation.",

            "text": "P3 Inhibits MERS-CoV by Inducing N Protein Aggregation. We demonstrated that P3 had the best characteristics as a therapeutic candidate. To determine the anti-MERS-CoV activity of P3 in the cell, the effects of P3 incubation on extracellular viral titers and intracellular viral RNA levels were assessed by plaque assays on Vero E6 cells ( Figure 4A ) and by RT-qPCR ( Figure 4B ), respectively. At 50 \u03bcM, P3 marginally affected the viral titer after 48 h but suppressed viral RNA replication by 40%. At 100 \u03bcM, P3 halted both viral production and replication after 48 h. This result proved the capacity of P3 as an antiviral compound. We then examined MERS-CoV N protein distribution and expression in the infected cells with or without P3 treatment (Table S1 ). The overall structures of the complexes resembled that of apo-MERS-CoV. Both complexes revealed well-defined unbiased densities in the dimer interface and permitted detailed analysis of the interactions between the compounds and MERS-CoV N-NTD ( Figure 5 ). The interactions between the N protein and each compound were calculated with the Discovery Studio Client (v19.1.0.18287). Most interactions were hydrophobic contacts, which were consistent with our selection rationale. In the P1 complex, N68, F135, and D143 on monomer 1 and V41, G106, P107, and T137 on monomer 2 packed against P1 to create a dimer ( Figure 5A ). In addition, two nonbonding interactions were detected between P1 and the monomers. There was a \u03c0-anion interaction between the benzene ring of the P1 indoline moiety and D143 of monomer 1. There was also a \u03c0-donor hydrogen bond between the other P1 benzene ring and the T137 side chain of monomer 2 ( Figure 5B ). Relative to P1, P3 bound more deeply into the dimer interface and interacted with a larger number of residues on both N-NTD monomers. The amino acid composition of this binding region was W43, N66, N68, S69, T70, N73, and F135 on monomer 1 and V41, G104, T105, G106, A109, and T137 on monomer 2. These residues along with P3 generated a massive hydrophobic driving force allowing the proteins and ligands to pack against each other and stabilize the dimeric conformation of the N protein ( Figure 5C ). Several nonbonding interactions were also observed at the P3-binding site. These included the interaction between the P3 benzene ring and N68 of monomer 1 and A109 of monomer 2 via \u03c0-lone pair and \u03c0-alkyl interactions. The dimethylaminomethyl moiety of P3 was a major source of nonbonding interactions. Three \u03c0-cation interactions formed between this moiety and the aromatic groups of W43 and F135 in monomer 1. This moiety also formed a \u03c0-lone pair interaction with N66 and a \u03c0-sigma interaction with W43 of monomer 1 ( Figure 5D ). The structural analyses explain the comparatively stronger binding of P3 to N-NTD ( Figure 2B ) and corroborated the thermal stabilization effects ( Figure 2C ) and antiviral activities (Table  1 ) of the compounds.",

Most compounds created by structure-based Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article design to manipulate the PPI depend on detailed knowledge of the native interacting interfaces. 35\u221237 In contrast, most of the compounds with therapeutic potential that stabilize non-native PPI interfaces were discovered by chance alone. 38 The antiinfluenza compound nucleozin was initially discovered using a chemical genetics approach, and its ability to stabilize nonnative nucleoprotein oligomers was elucidated much later. 39, 40 Swinholide A, a cytotoxic marine macrolide, has been known to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton and act as an anticancer agent, but it took ten years to discover that it stabilized G-actin as a non-native homodimer complex. 41\u221243 However, these examples did underscore the importance of hydrophobicity as a crucial factor stabilizing protein\u2212protein and protein\u2212ligand associations. 44 Here, we demonstrated the possibility of using the hydrophobic interactions on non-native interfaces as targets for virtual screening. Combined with suitable selection criteria focusing on both shape and hydrophobic complementarities between the ligand and the receptor, small-molecule compounds that stabilize non-native PPIs may be identified in a rational manner. Using the above approach, we successfully identified a compound P3 that affected the biochemical activity of our target protein and showed efficacy against our target pathogen MERS-CoV (Figures 2 and 4) . P3-mediated nonnative MERS-CoV N-NTD dimerization induced abnormal N protein aggregation by influencing the oligomeric behavior of N-CTD and eventually halting its function in RNP formation.",

The hydrophobic pocket surrounding W43 and F135 on monomer 1 is shared among other \u03b2coronaviruses. 24, 28 The interacting surface on monomer 2, which includes G104, T105, G106, and A109, is also highly conserved ( Figure S4 ). This conservation may provide certain advantages when developing compounds with broad-spectrum activity against a target pathogen family, including COVID-19. When we tested P3 on mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), we observed a reduction in viral titer, indicating that P3 may also inhibit MHV replication ( Figure S5 ). On the other hand, targeting non-native interaction interfaces is not trivial. As interface formation is induced by an external agent, computations aimed at predicting native PPI structures may not be able to identify potential non-native interfaces. Nevertheless, several stratagems may assist in the identification of potential non-native interaction interfaces. One strategy is to Journal of Medicinal Chemistry pubs.acs.org/jmc Article search for target protein structures with crystal packing contacts known to be biologically irrelevant. Another approach is to identify weakly interacting sites through NMR chemical shift perturbation and hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS. 45 Once these potential non-native interaction interfaces are identified, standard screening and then functional characterization may be conducted for small compounds that bind to the interface.",

(H) Schematic of the P3 inhibition mechanism. Left panel: in the absence of RNA, N proteins organize as a dimeric building block contributed by N-CTD dimerization. Middle panel: P3 promoted the dimerization of N-NTDs from different building blocks, by which the distance between CTD cuboids was shortened and N protein aggregation occurred. Right panel: octameric conformation of building blocks buried in the RNA-binding surface of N-CTDs. It hindered the formation of filamentous ribonucleocapsids. our SAXS findings. Immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 4C) showed condensation of the intracellular N protein fluorescence signal in infected Vero E6 cells treated with 50 \u03bcM P3. Thus, P3 may induce intracellular N protein aggregation. At 100 \u03bcM, P3 suppressed N protein expression in most cells. However, a few presented with intense N protein signals. P3 may have restrained the MERS-CoV N proteins inside the infected cells that promoted the formation of new virions that could not be released. In this way, the adjacent cells could not be infected with MERS-CoV. The data, therefore, suggest that P3 may inhibit MERS-CoV by inducing abnormal aggregation of the N protein inside the cell. This finding is consistent with the results of our structure-based assays.Crystal Structure of MERS-CoV N-NTD Complexed with Potent Compounds. We attempted to obtain crystals of MERS-CoV N-NTD in complex with compounds P1, P2, and P3 by cocrystallization or ligand-soaking.
