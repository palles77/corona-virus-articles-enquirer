In this study, we report the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of porcine PBVs from North Eastern Hilly region of India. A total of 457 fecal samples from piglets were collected from local (n = 130) and cross (n = 327) breed piglets in different seasons for 2 years. All the samples were subjected to RNA-PAGE and RT-PCR analysis for detection of PBVs. A total of 4.59 and 11.15% samples were recorded as positive for PBVs by RNA-PAGE and RT-PCR, respectively. Rate of detection was higher from diarrhoeic animals (13.56%) compared to non-diarrhoeic (4.23%) animals. Higher prevalence rate was observed from unorganized farms (14.22%) compared to organized farms (8.0%) with slightly higher detection from cross breed (11.62%) compared to local breed (10.0%). Maximum cases of piglet diarrhea associated with PBVs were detected during summer (16.4%) and winter (14.39%) seasons compared to autumn (4.80%) and spring (6.45%). All the samples were positive for PBV genogroup I only. Based upon the sequence analysis, the isolates were unique and placed in separate clad and were not closely associated with any other Indian isolates of PBVs so far. Two isolates were closely related with one Chinese isolate recovered from sewage water. This is the first systematic study of prevalence of PBVs associated with piglet diarrhea.",

(1988a) from Brazil. Thereafter, PBVs were detected in fecal specimens of humans and wide range of animals, birds, rodents from different parts of the world (Malik et al. 2014) . PBVs are regarded as enteric viruses as most of their detection is associated with virus shed in feces. They have been detected in animals and human patients with and without gastroenteritis and were found co-infected with other enteric viruses such as Rotavirus, Astrovirus, Calicivirus, and Coronavirus (Malik et al. 2014) . PBVs genogroups I and II have been reported from respiratory tract specimens from pigs obtained in slaughter houses in China, Hongkong, and Sri Lanka (Smits et al. 2011 ) and from environmental samples including community sewage and surface waters, which indicate their worldwide prevalence in nature (Symonds et al. 2009; Hamza et al. 2011) . In India, only a handful of information on PBV infection in bovines (Malik et al. 2011 ) and domestic pigs (Ganesh et al. 2012 ) are available, but no systematic study on prevalence of PBV infection in domestic animals has been conducted so far.",

Samples were electrophorosed at 100 V until the dye reached to be the end of the gel (approx. 4 h). The gel was silver impregnated following the method of Herring et al. (1982) and documented. For the estimation of molecular weight of the two segments of PBV, samples were run with group A rotavirus and 1 kbps DNA ladder (Fermentas) on 1\u00d7 agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and documented in Gel doc system (Alpha Image, USA). The dsRNA nature of these segments was confirmed by nuclease treatment. Digestion of nucleic acid was performed following the method described by Pereira et al. (1988b) . Briefly, 1 \u03bcg of purified PBV RNA was treated separately with pancreatic RNase A, RNaseT1, and DNase 1. The pancreatic RNase A was used after boiling for 10 min at a final concentration of 10 ug/ml in Tris-EDTA-NaCl (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA), while RNaseT1 was used at a final concentration of 10 U/ml in the same buffer mentioned above and DNase1 was used at 10 U/ml in 40 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.9), 10 mM CaC1 2 , and 6 mM MgC1 2 .

The difference in prevalence by RNA-PAGE and RT-PCR is well established being the RNA-PGE is less sensitive technique in comparison to RT-PCR for detection of RNA virus infection in host (Malik et al. 2014) . Majority of the earlier worker in different parts of world recorded higher prevalence of PBVs in man and/or animals (Carruyo et al. 2008; Banyai et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2007 Wang et al. , 2012 by RT-PCR than RNA-PAGE. But in contrast to them, few workers were also recorded either equal (Ganesh et al. 2012) or less prevalence of PBVs (Fregolente et al. 2009 ) by RT-PCR than RNA-PAGE. Prevalence of PBVs in pigs is highly variable (0.4 to 65%) globally (Malik et al. 2014) . In India, only one report on detection of Picobirnavirus in pigs from Kolkata is available (Ganesh et al. 2012 ) with a limited number of sample size (n = 11), of which 18.20% were positive by both RNA-PAGE and RT-PCR. All the positive samples under the present study exhibited the presence of GG1 Picobirnavirus in the piglets of NEH region of India. Ganesh et al. (2012) also detected only GG1 PBV from pigs of Kolkata, India. Although, GGII PBV is reported from India in other animals (Malik et al. 2014 ) and human (Ganesh et al. 2010 ) hosts but not from pigs. More systematic studies need to be conducted to establish the prevalence of genogroups of PBV in pigs in India.",

They could recover PBVs alone or as mixed infection with rotavirus in 15.30% diarrhoeic and 9.60% Ludert et al. (1991) failed to establish any such conclusion, where high incidence of PBV infection without diarrhea (12.30%) compared to pigs with clinical diarrhea (10.0%) is reported. Picobirnavirus is not considered to be as a primary pathogen associated with diarrhea in man and animals rather an opportunistic organisms can develop the clinical disease in association with other established pathogens, viz., rotavirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, E. coli, Salmonella, etc., (Malik et al. 2014 ). But recovery of high level of PBV from the diarrhoeic piglets under the present study has definitely indicated its role in the development of diarrhea in the host. In India, prior to this report, no such study has been undertaken in this regard so far.",

The result may have a direct correlation with the managemental practices. Picobirnaviruses can directly enter and transmit through sewage water in the farms (Symonds et al. 2009 ). The small and landless farmers with a handful of animals are not able to maintain proper hygienic practices at their own which may be the reason to attract the PBV in the farm. Prevalence of PBVs in cross breed animals is recorded as higher (11.62%) than local animal population (10.0%). Although the variation is not very wide or significant, but it may be possible that the local non-descriptive animals possess better protective nature against natural infection than the exotic or cross breed animals. In addition, the weaning age of piglets of local animals is generally 8-10 weeks in comparison with the cross breed animals in organized farms (within 6 weeks). Maternal immunity might also play an important role in resisting the infection in piglets. The close proximity of the cross bred animals reared in the commercial farms may also be one of the reasons for this fact.",

To the best of our knowledge, no such studies are conducted to record the seasonal effect on PBV infection in piglets. We have collected the samples consistently for 2 years from the similar location with similar frequency. The humid climatic condition during summer and winter with persistent rain fall in this region of country may be an influential factor for persistence and consistent spread of infection among the animals. The similar climatic condition is also a favorable environment for other enteric pathogens like E. coli, Salmonella, rotavirus, coronovirus which are considered to be the common associated pathogens of PBV for the development of diarrhea in piglets. Studies describing the seasonal pattern of PBVs in diarrhoeic piglets or other animal and in fact in human have rarely been published.

Although obtained from same host and within a small geographical area, selected four isolates under this study were appeared in three different clades indicating their genetic diversity. Interestingly, two isolates (GenBank accession no. KT380848 and KT380849) that are located in same unique clade with 100% sequence homology are also placed with one human isolates from India (Fig. 1) . This result strongly suggests that PBV strains may circulate in the shared environment, where human and animals survive. In addition, all the four isolates were distinctly placed in the phylogenetic tree and are not associated with the genomic sequence of any of the other Indian isolates from human or animals. So to know the possible origin of the PBVs recorded in the piglets in NEH region of India needs to be studied in detail under the future study. Transmission of PBVs from animals to man or man to animals is not yet established. Although the sequence similarities are obtained using partial sequence of a single gene region (RdRp), but detection of PBVs in sewage and surface waters at relatively high frequency and the close proximity of animals and man as well as sequence similarities between the virus isolates obtained from them are important indicators of its possibilities. \u03c7 2 = 11.258, **\u03c7 2 12 = 4.977, *\u03c7 2 13 = 0.252, \u03c7 2 14 = 3.485, \u03c7 2 23 = 7.757,**\u03c7 2 24 = 0.202, **\u03c7 2 34 = 5.852* *Significantly different (p < 0.05), **Significantly different (p < 0.01)",
