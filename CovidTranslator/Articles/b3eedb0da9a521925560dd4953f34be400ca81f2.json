Methods: Clinical assessments of PTSD were conducted at 2, 7, 10, 20 and 46 months after discharge from medical hospitalization for treatment of SARS. Diagnoses of PTSD were established by a trained psychiatrist using the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders Results: Of the 68 subjects who finished at least two follow-up interviews, 30 developed PTSD over the study period (44.1%). Scores on IES, SAS, SDS and SCL-90 (Pb.0001) were higher, and functional impairment as measured by SF-36 (Pb.0001) and SDSS was more severe (P=.0073) for subjects with PTSD. Conclusion: PTSD occurs in a significant percentage of subjects who recover from SARS, and the occurrence of PTSD predicts persistent psychological distress and diminished social functioning in the 4 years after SARS treatment.",

The public was terrified, with widespread media attention concerning the severity of the epidemic.

The transmission rate among close contacts was 6.3% (range by Beijing local government districts, 2.9-9.7%). Transmission increased with the age of close contacts, from 5.0% in children younger than 10 years to 27.6% in adults aged 60 to 69 years.

In one study of 63 survivors of SARS at 3 months postdischarge from hospital in Singapore, the rate of possible PTSD, inferred from an Impact of Event Scale (IES) Score of N26, was 41.7% [15] . In a study of 195 survivors of SARS at 1 month postdischarge from hospital in Hong Kong, 10% to 18% of them reported symptoms related to PTSD [16] . In another study in Hong Kong, among 131 survivors, 4% at 1 month and 5% at 3 months postdischarge endorsed symptoms consistent with PTSD [17] . However, these articles were limited by use of self-reported ratings of PTSD, and no specific PTSD measures were included. Several studies suggest that SARS survivors still had elevated levels of general psychological distress 1, 3, 12 and 18 months after hospital discharge, but the rate of PTSD is unspecified in these studies [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .

Furthermore, several articles published in Chinese focused on the incidence of PTSD on SARS survivors in Beijing, Shanxi and Tianjin in mainland China, and the incidence rate of PTSD was reported to be 9.8%, 30.7% and 46.2% at 3 months postdischarge [25] [26] [27] .",

Scale scores were transformed and standardized on a scale ranging from 0 to 100, with lower scores representing poorer health functioning [37] . SF-36 has been translated into Chinese and normed on Chinese populations [38] . e. Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) was conducted in T3 to T5. SDSS is a 10-item rateradministered scale used to access the function in a variety of occupational, social, marital and family roles.

This incidence rate is similar to that reported for 63 survivors of SARS at 3 months after discharge from hospital in Singapore, where the rate of possible PTSD was 41.7% [15] . Great variations in rates of PTSD have been reported after impersonal events such as serious motor vehicle accidents and natural disasters, with reported ranges of 10% to 43% [43] [44] [45] . Focusing on another life-threatening condition, Davydow et al. [46] reviewed 10 observational studies among survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome and found that the psychiatrist-diagnosed PTSD prevalence at hospital discharge, 5 years and 8 years was 44%, 25% and 24%, respectively. In this study, we use the CCMD-III criteria [41] , which is a more conservative measure of PTSD than DSM-IV [42] , with a 3-month vs. a 1-month requirement for symptom duration. In the survey, two subjects fulfilled the symptom criteria, severity criteria, but not the course criteria for CCMD-III in the T1 visit (interval between T1 and hospital discharge was 18 and 65 days, respectively) and were not located thereafter. Had we used DSM-IV criteria only, the latter subject (interviewed at 65 days after hospital discharge) would have been diagnosed with PTSD. It is unlikely that we overestimated the incidence of PTSD by using stricter diagnostic criteria. A critical question is whether the 70 survivors enrolled in the study are representative of the 2329 SARS survivors in Beijing. The average age in our cohort was 38.5 years, which is close to the median age of Beijing SARS cases (33 years), with no significant difference in age distribution between those two groups (P=.420). Females were overrepresented in our sample (67.1%), which may reflect differences in help-seeking behavior between genders [47, 48] . Females with mental health problems are more likely to seek help from medical professionals [47] , although in the current study, participants also sought help from Departments of Infectious Disease and Respiratory Medicine.",

This is consistent with other studies, including the 1996 Detroit Area Survey of Trauma, where the median time for PTSD to remit was 24.9 months and where in more than one third of cases PTSD persisted for more than 60 months. Previous research suggests that PTSD persists longer in women (median duration is 48.1 months) than in men (12.0 months) and persists longer in cases resulting from traumas experienced directly (median duration is 48.1 months) compared with learning about traumas to a loved one or the sudden unexpected death of a loved one (12.1 months) [49] .

There was no significant difference between those with PTSD and those without PTSD on chest CT findings in T1. But the marginal significance (P=.060) suggested the necessity of larger sample size to clarify the correlation. The number of close relatives who suffered or died from SARS may be an important indicator of the event severity. FHN, a specific serious adverse medical outcome related to SARS treatment, may be a chronic stressor to these survivors.
