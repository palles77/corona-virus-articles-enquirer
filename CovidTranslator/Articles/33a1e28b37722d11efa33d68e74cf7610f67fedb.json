China is a major donor of nurses to other parts of the world and this article discusses the solutions China has implemented to address its nursing shortage, and the challenges that it is currently facing. The strategies that have been employed include: improving the health care system, improving work cultures for increased retention through policy and regulation, making greater investments in nursing education to build sustainable nursing education infrastructures, and enhancing the image of the nursing profession. These solutions may serve as a reference to other countries to deal with the crisis of a nursing shortage.",

            "text": "T oday's health sectors worldwide face the challenge of providing high quality care, despite increasing healthcare costs and limited resources. 1 In particular, the scarcity of qualified health personnel, including nurses, is being highlighted as one of the biggest obstacles to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for improving the health and well-being of the global population. 2 The term ''nursing shortage'' refers to the situation in which the demand for nurses is greater than the supply. According to the International Council of Nurses, the shortage is global in scale. In Canada, for instance, the shortfall of nurses is expected to be around 78 000 by 2011, and Australia projects a shortage of 40 000 nurses by 2010. 2 The United States has the largest professional nurse workforce in the world, approximately 3 million, but it also does not produce enough nurses to meet the growing demand. In the US, a shortage of nearly 1 million professional nurses is predicted by 2020. 3 Inadequate supplies of hospital nurses will increase the workload for all nurses, lower the quality of nursing care and subsequently threaten the safety of patients. Studies have even reported a shortage of nurses to be associated with higher rates of patient mortality. 4 Other outcomes include increased risks for occupational injury, increased nursing turnover, and greater chances for nurses to solicit psychiatric assistance as a resource at high levels of job stress. 5 Insufficient numbers of nurse educators are also an issue and leads to fewer students graduating from nursing schools to keep up with the demand which, ultimately, aggravates the nursing shortage. [6] [7] This nursing shortage crisis is of concern to nursing leaders all over the world. In 1999, the planning committee of the Lillian Carter Centre for International Nursing (LCCIN), sponsored by the International Council of Nurses (ICN) and the World Health Organization (WHO), developed a questionnaire to identify the specific needs and challenges being faced by chief nursing officers (CNOs) all over the world. The shortage of nurses was reported as a major problem for 84% of CNOs responding to the survey. 8 In order to alleviate this critical situation, recruiting nurses from abroad has been a strategy employed by many countries. 9 However, most of the recipients are wealthy, industrialized countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. [10] [11] In other words, highly developed countries are the desired destinations for thousands of migrating nurses who seek adequate pay and good working conditions. 1 As a result, this flow aggravates the imbalance between the supply and the demand in human resources in developing countries. For example, Africa, which has been a big supplier for qualified nurses for other countries, became the worst hit area and faces a serious shortage of nursing manpower. 12 Though the critical situation in developing countries had been reported, few studies were focused on its actual reasons and potential solutions in these donor countries.",

Although the country saw a large increase of 80 000 nurses in 2008, the number still cannot meet the demands for patient care. 13 In July 2007, there was an investigation of 696 comprehensive Grade A hospitals in 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. In China, Grade A hospitals are the hospitals that provide high quality and specialized medical health care service to several districts and are responsible for the education of nurses in the baccalaureate, master's and doctoral programs, as well as research. According to the investigation, these hospitals all had a very low ratio of nurses to beds (about 0.38 to 1) which was far lower than in other countries. According to the World Health Statistics 2009, the nurses-to-beds ratio ranges from a low of 1.1 in the African Region to a high of 1.25 to 1 in the European region. 14 In that investigation, ward nurses in China were expected to provide care for at least 10-14 patients. For some, this figure was > 30 patients to 1 nurse. Sixty-five percent of ''first line'' nurses worked > 10 hours every day. 15 In 2005, the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China (MOH, PRC) published the Nursing Development Plan in China (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) , expecting that the nursing vacancy rate would reach 50% of all health worker positions by 2010. By the end of 2008, the vacancy rate of nursing was 27%, which means that there are at least 1.4 million vacancies for registered nurses (RN) that need to be filled. In fact, the total number of health professional graduates-including nurses, doctors, and dentistswill only be approximately 0.9 million based on the number of entrants to the colleges and secondary schools. It is no doubt that China is in a state of serious imbalance between the demand and the supply for nurses.",

Changes in political structures, technology, and general globalization have led to the evolution of Chinese health care and the nursing profession just as they have in other parts of the world. 16 At present, the reform of the health system in China, including innovations in the healthcare workforce, is still in process. Old and new systems exist in parallel in this particular era of reform, which leads to many unusual and inequitable practices. In China, nurses can be categorized into 2 kinds: formal employed nurses and contract supernumerary employed nurses (ie, temporary nurses). Most temporary nurses don't receive equal pay for equal work when compared to formal nurses. In a number of health institutions, a contract nurse earns half of the pay bonus of a formal nurse. As a result, many hospitals have reduced certain nurses' income by classifying them as temporary workers, which means they can pay them reduced salaries in order to cut costs. Additionally, in some hospitals, nurses employed by supernumerary contract cannot participate in continuing education, job promotions, and are not paid for public holidays. 15 At the same time, hospital administrators in China are prone to hire more physicians than nurses because physicians are seen as a source of income generation related to surgeries and expensive medications. 17 As a result, China has more physicians than nurses, which differs from most countries in the world. Table 1 depicts the nurseto-physician ratio of the Western Pacific region (WPRO) as 1:4, which is the lowest of the 6 WHO regions. As a member of WPRO, the ratio in China (0.7) was far lower than the average level of even the WPRO. 14 It is possible that the duties or responsibilities of nurses in China are different from nurses in other countries and could be a factor influencing the low ratio of nurses to physicians. Nurses are only permitted to do basic treatments, as the majority of nurses are not educated in higher academic degree programs but rather hold associate degrees and diplomas. In addition, patients often rely mostly on doctors in the traditional health system of China.",

            "text": "This situation seriously affects the stability of the nursing team, and the inequities related to pay and status affect morale. Many nurses leave their posts in protest of a hospitals' poor working conditions, their own low socioeconomic and professional status, and poor job availability. As a result, hospital nurses who remain suffer from even heavier workloads and stress. In order to relieve the pressure on nurses, much of the patient care in hospitals is supplied by patients' relatives, or by unlicensed personnel, which obviously lowers the quality of nursing and subsequently threatens the safety of patients. Eventually, young women who would consider nursing, as well as dissatisfied nurses, seek other career opportunities, so it is expected that the shortage will worsen. It is reported that Shanghai has lost 13% of its nurses over the last 5 years. 18 Among these nurses, 93% felt their job was too hard; 85% said the salary was too low; 84% felt that they were under too much pressure; and 81% complained about poor professional status. 18 Why is China suffering a shortfall of 5 million nurses? Some believe this is due to poor labor planning, poor distribution of nurses, and imperfections in the healthcare system. 19 Although jobs are always available in rural areas, the pay and working conditions are usually not attractive to many nurses. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Health of China, nurse density in urban areas is much higher than that in rural areas. There are 18.8 RNs per 10 000 population in urban cities and only 5.5 RNs per 10 000 population in rural areas. Hence, in rural China, the shortage is even worse ( Table 2) . 20 The nurse distribution is also inequitable in regions with low incomes (Figure 1 ). 20 Most RNs (713 421) work in eastern China with a highly developed economy. By contrast, there are many fewer RNs (only 36 477) in western China, which is also the poorest area in the country. 20 Yet the unemployment rate in urban areas keeps increasing because many students with a diploma are denied by hospitals in urban and wealthy provinces, leading to a worsening imbalance and a waste of human resources. Sudhir Anand et al concluded these inequalities may also be associated with corresponding economic disparities (eg, between countries, between provinces, and between strata). 21",

At present, the nursing education system in China includes diploma, associate degrees, baccalaureate and master's degrees, and doctoral programs. Over recent decades, there has been a massive expansion in the number of individuals admitted to medical, nursing, and other health-related education programs. Since 1998, the government has made a substantial effort to expand health professions education. From 1998-2007, the number of admissions to college level programs in medical and health-related fields expanded by 461% (increased from 1.1 million in 1998 to 6.1 million in 2007), while admissions to all junior technical schools in the same fields expanded by 94% (increased from 1.7 million in 1998 to 3.3 million in 2007). In the same period, the number of nurses grew by 27% (and by 7% for all health workers) (Figure 3 ). 20 Experts proposed that the average number of all nursing programs admissions should be about 150 000 annually from 2003-2010. 25 By the year 2010, enrollment of nursing students from senior or junior schools will be reduced to 50%, while there will be a significant increase in the number of students of junior colleges or secondary technical schools by 30%, and an increase at the college level or above by 20%. In the past, most nurses were educated after they graduated from junior schools, but now the number of these programs are being gradually reduced. If that occurs, nurses with a diploma degree or above (ie, baccalaureate) will comprise > 30% of the nurses. In the third level hospitals, 50% of the nurses will have a diploma degree or above and, in the second level hospitals, 30% of the nurses will have a diploma degree or above. 29 In China, the hospitals are divided into 3 levels according their function. Third level hospitals are Grade A hospitals, as described earlier. Second level hospitals are district hospitals that provide comprehensive medical and health care services to multiple communities and carry out some teaching and research activities. First level hospitals are community hospitals that directly provide primary healthcare services including disease prevention, medical care, health care and rehabilitation, to a certain population in the community. In addition, specialized nurse training has been an important goal of nursing education in recent years. Between 2005-2010, China also plans to develop programs to educate clinical nurse specialists (CNS) in the area of critical care nursing, organ transplant, operative nursing, nursing care of tumor patients, etc. However, in China, there is still much discussion about the level of education for the CNS program (i.e., bachelor or master's degree). According to the investigation of Shen Ning, 53% of nursing experts propose the CNS program should be at the bachelor degree level considering the actual situation of nursing in China. 30 Due to the limited educational resources, various methods have been tried to train nursing students in China. Military and civilian universities have cooperated with each other to reciprocally train students, which has proved to be a successful model in China. In China, military nursing education is of top quality. For example, the first nursing doctoral program in China was opened in the Second Military Medical University. However, in the era of peace, the demand for nurses in the military is not very high. Therefore, these advanced and abundant nursing faculties and other resources are available in the military. Nursing programs for nonmilitary service are also run in military medical schools. In addition, military faculty members are asked to give lectures in civilian universities. The students trained in military school are welcomed by hospitals, for they are not only proficient in clinical skills but also have a strong physical capability to deal with the heavy workload in nursing practice.",

To solve the nursing shortage via collaboration with the military may be another good strategy in some countries. For example, corpsmen could be encouraged to serve in civilian hospitals when they retire from the army. More nurses could be co-developed by greater cooperation of civilian universities and military colleges.",
