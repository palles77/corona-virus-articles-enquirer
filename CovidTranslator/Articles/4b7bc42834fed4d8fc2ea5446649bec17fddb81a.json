Single stranded DNA binding proteins help stabilize the formation of a D loop enabling this primer invasion. 7: Strand displacing polymerase can then extend the oligo. 8: This produce a novel dsDNA construct that can then serve as a template for the next round resulting in exponential amplification in an isothermal reaction. Overhanging sequences can be designed into the primers, which are incorporated into the final dsDNA product. In this work overhang sequences are used to add a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a fragment of a STAR sequence ( Figure 1A) for downstream detection of an RNA produced from the RPA product. Figure 2 : Small Transcription Activating RNA (STAR) mechanism 5 . Target DNA plasmid consists of a reporter gene transcriptionally gated by the presence of a 5' terminating hairpin (Target). In the absence of a STAR, the terminating hairpin folds, preventing downstream transcription of the reporter gene (OFF). When present, the STAR RNA binds to the linear region and 5' stem of the terminator, destabilizing the structure and allowing for downstream transcription of the desired reporter gene (ON). Figure 3 : Correlation between absorbance value on a SynergyH1 microplate reader (Biotek) with visual perception of color change in a catechol expression experiment. Reactions were allowed to proceed until a yellow pigment was clearly visible and then serially diluted with water. These dilutions were first photographed and then their absorbance was measured on the plate reader. In some instances, depending on the lighting and individual, we report that it is possible to discern down to 0.5 Abs(385nm). Based upon this data, we have identified an absorbance of 0.8 to be our limit of detection (LOD). Figure 4 : Catechol to hydroxymuconic semialdehyde reaction. The enzyme catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (CDO) rapidly cleaves catechol into hydroxymuconic semialdehyde. This product can be detected by a measure of the absorbance at 385nm (SI Figure 3 ). ",
