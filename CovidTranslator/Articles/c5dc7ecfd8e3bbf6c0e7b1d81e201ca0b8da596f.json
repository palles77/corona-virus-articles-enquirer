Like SARS previously and Zika recently, the Ebola crisis in 2015 showed how vulnerable the world is to these epidemics, with over 11,000 people dying in the outbreak. In addition to causing immense human suffering, these epidemics particularly affect low-and middle-income countries. Many of these deadly infectious diseases that have epidemic potential can become global health emergencies in the absence of effective vaccines. But very few vaccines against these threats have been developed to create proven medical products. The measles vaccine is an efficient, live attenuated, replicating virus that has been safely administered to 2 billion children over the last 40 years, affording life-long protection after a single dose. Taking advantage of these characteristics, this attenuated virus was transformed into a versatile chimeric or recombinant vaccine vector with demonstrated proof-ofprinciple in humans and a preclinical track record of rapid adaptability and effectiveness for a variety of pathogens. Clinical trials have shown the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine platform in individuals with preexisting immunity to measles. This review describes the potential of this platform to develop new vaccines against emerging viral diseases.",

The R&D Blueprint aims to reduce the time between the declaration of an international public health emergency and the availability of effective tests, vaccines, antivirals, and other treatments that can save lives and avert a public health crisis. Following that initiative, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (http://cepi.net) was created. CEPI is an alliance between governments, industry, academia, philanthropy, intergovernmental institutions, such as the WHO, and civil society that aims to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines to prevent and contain infectious disease epidemics. As epidemics disproportionately affect lowincome countries, CEPI will ensure that the vaccines will be affordable and available to populations with the most need.",

However, the treatment window for acute viral infections is short and symptoms often only appear late in the course of infection, during the viral clearance phase (Fig. 1 ) and after the host has become infectious. Passive immunization can be used in emergency cases in high exposure areas, as seen with EBOV [9] , NiV [10] or Hendra virus [11] outbreaks, but this approach is not practical for general implementation due to high cost and limited efficacy.

            "text": "Indeed, vaccines have been crucial to the control or elimination of many deadly viral diseases and represent the most efficient method to prevent viral infection. Inactivated (killed) viruses, live attenuated viruses, and subunit vaccines comprise the conventional mode of vaccination. Inactivated-virus vaccines are made of whole virus particles treated with chemicals, heat or radiation. Live attenuated virus vaccines are created by passaging virulent virus strains in animals or cell culture until the virus has adapted to its new host and are no longer pathogenic in target animals or humans (usually after 5 to 100 or 200 passages). Inactivated-virus and subunit vaccines are non-replication competent, so while there is no risk of reversion to infectivity, they are usually not effective enough to elicit strong host immune responses on their own. Immunization efficacy requires the use of adjuvants and several boosters, which can in turn cause side effects and severe allergic reactions. On the other hand, live attenuated vaccines elicit longterm protective immune responses because they can replicate inside the host. However, depending on the number of attenuation mutations and on the viral family, there is a risk of reversion where virulence can be regained through reassortment with pathogenic strains, as observed with the oral live polio vaccine [12] . Moreover, the conventional attenuation is a lengthy process requiring numerous passages that can take from 6 months to several years of work, rendering it impractical as a prompt response to ongoing outbreaks.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, given their efficacy, simple administration regimens, and ease in large-scale manufacture, live attenuated vaccines remain attractive choices for vaccine design. Highly successful examples of live attenuated vaccines include those developed against smallpox, yellow fever, poliomyelitis, and measles, with the latter three being successfully implemented in low-and middle-income countries through the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). Well-tested and effective live attenuated virus vaccines can be modified with modern recombinant DNA technology to combine the advantages of replicating viral vectors with the need for rapid methods of developing new vaccines for emerging or re-emerging diseases. Live replicating vectors, such as the MV vector, are characterized by induction of long-lived protective immunity after one or two administrations. With reverse genetics technology, a viral vector vaccine platform can be created to carry antigenic proteins from another circulating virus to yield a vaccine candidate that can be quickly tested in established animal models. Such a \"plug-andplay\" platform has the capacity to provide rapid responses to future emerging viral diseases. ranging from 150 to 350 nm due to the flexibility of envelope structure. Inside the particles, the genomic viral RNA is tightly wrapped with N, P and L to constitute a helicoidal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which is auto-replicative in the host cytoplasm. The RNP serves as the template for viral RNA synthesis, and with each N molecule associated with 6 nucleotides, efficient replication requires that the genome length respects the so-called 'rule of six', which means that the total number of genome nucleotides is dividable by 6 [13] . Since the helicoidal structure is highly flexible like a spring, the genome tolerates large insertions as long as the total length complies with the 'rule of six'. Viral genes are transcribed in succession from the N to L genes as the polymerase stops and restarts at intergenic regions. However, as efficiency of re-initialization is not 100%, mRNAs are produced in decreasing amounts from the 5 0 to 3 0 end of the genome, resulting in the greatest abundance of N and lowest abundance of L protein. Accumulation of intracellular N protein promotes a shift from transcription to replication. During replication, L synthesizes a complete copy of the entire genome as a positive-sense antigenome which serves as the template for generation of full-length negative-sense genomes for packaging. Viral particles are assembled with the N, P and L proteins synthesized in the cytoplasm before budding from the plasma membrane together with envelope proteins localized to the surface membrane.",

In the past 40 years, the MV vaccine has been administered safely to over 2 billion children, with no case of reversion reported. It induces both humoral and cellular immune responses by efficiently stimulating long-lasting memory Be and T-cells and provides lifelong immunity. It has an efficacy rate of approximately 93% after one administration and 97% after two administrations. The virus only replicates in the cytoplasm, hence there are no possibility of viral genome integration into the host genome. Thanks to its nonsegmented negative-sense RNA genome, there is no genomic recombination possible or observed with other viruses. Furthermore, the MV vaccine is currently produced on a large scale in many countries and is globally distributed at low cost through the EPI. Therefore, the MV vector platform provides a means of rapidly generating potent vaccine candidates against a broad spectrum of epidemic disease targets, and its accessible manufacturing process provides a means to rapidly scale-up vaccines at low cost for stockpiling purposes and as a rapid response vaccine countermeasure to epidemic threats.",

Later, the Schwarz strain of MV was cloned at Institut Pasteur (Paris) as it is a commercially and WHO approved, mostly attenuated, efficient and widely used MV vaccine strain [20] . To generate an infectious clone, its full-length antigenomic viral cDNA (Fig. 2b) was cloned into the pTM plasmid under the control of the T7 RNA promoter. DNA sequences containing a GGG motif, hammerhead and hepatitis delta viral ribozymes were added to facilitate accurate cleavage of the viral RNA and ensure production of fulllength viral RNA. The virus can be produced or rescued by transfection of pTM-MVschw plasmid together with a plasmid expressing the Schwarz MV L gene into trans-complemented human cells (HEK293 cells constitutively expressing T7 RNA polymerase, MV N and MV P). Transfected cells are then further cocultured with any MV permissive cell line such as Vero, MRC5 or chicken embryonic fibroblasts. Plaques are picked and seeded for amplification and characterization. Rescued viruses from the cDNA clone possess the same sequence as the parental Schwarz strain, demonstrating the stability of the negative-sense genome. To enable insertion of foreign antigens, several additional transcription units (ATUs) based on MV cis-acting sequences were introduced into pTM-MVschw at various sites in the genome. Cloning sites can accommodate inserts of over 6 kb in length, in multiples of six base pairs to respect the 'rule of six' that is essential for measles genome replication [13] .",

However, it was demonstrated that recombinant MV vaccines induce strong immune responses even in previously immunized animals or humans [15, 21, 22] . Although surprising, a few MV properties may account for this phenomenon. First, recombinant MV are replicating, therefore although low doses are used, the vaccine is amplified in vivo. Upon cell infection, the recombinant MV expresses measles proteins as well as heterologous antigens, and MV particles are assembled and released from the cell. Heterologous antigens are either secreted from the cell or expressed on the cell surface, depending on the nature of the antigen, and stimulate the immune response. Second, the virus delivers antigens directly to dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells (the most effective antigen presenting cells), and viral particles are transmitted from cell to cell by cell contacts. Lastly, we have recently shown that additional antigens expressed from replicating MV vectors are naturally adjuvanted through defective interfering genomes produced by the recombinant virus, contributing to robust induction of interferon and conferring vaccine efficacy [23] .",

Preclinical studies in CD46\u00fe/IFNAR\u00c0/\u00c0 mice showed full protection from lethal CHIKV challenge after a single immunization, even in presence of preexisting immunity to the vector [21] . The MV-CHIKV vaccine candidate was further introduced into clinical trials by Themis Bioscience (http://themisbio. com). Immunogenicity was demonstrated in phase I clinical trial with a 90% seroconversion rate after a single injection and 100% seroconversion after boosting (28 days or 3 months apart) [22] . There were no serious adverse reactions observed; even the group receiving a high dose (3 \u00c2 10 5 TCID 50 ) displayed only mild reactions such as headache, flu-like symptoms and mild muscle pain, similar to those observed with the control standard MV vaccine [22] . Most importantly, the study demonstrated that the immune response to measles and CHIKV VLP was not dampened by previous MV immunization since all volunteers were preimmune to measles [22] . The phase II clinical trial is ongoing with 400 volunteers in Austria and Germany (EudraCT No. 2013-001084-23). Additionally, two independent phase I studies have been initiated in the USA (NIH) and Puerto Rico (DoD) in June 2017 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03028441, NCT02861586). The success of MV-CHIKV thus far reaffirms that the MV vector is an excellent platform for vaccine development.",

The major complication of dengue infection is that four distinct serotypes of the virus circulate. After the first DENV infection, the host acquires life-long immunity to that particular serotype, but this does not provide cross-protection against other serotypes. Rather, nonneutralizing antibodies enhance infection of cells carrying the Fc receptors used by DENV for host cell entry. This phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [38, 39] . Due to ADE complications, the strategy for DENV vaccine development is to focus on tetravalent vaccines that simultaneously stimulate immune responses against all four DENV serotypes.",

In December 2013, however, an unprecedented outbreak emerged in the western African country of Guinea, causing a major crisis with its rapid spread within the country as well as to the neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia. Air travel led to imported cases in many countries (US, Spain, Mali and UK), turning the EBOV epidemic into a global public health emergency.

Unlike EBOV infection, Lassa fever occurs annually, posing a major threat to local populations, travelers and healthcare workers. The US CDC estimates that LASV causes 100,000e300,000 cases and 5000 deaths yearly.

The various immunization strategies have been summarized in a previous review [11] . Canarypox virus carrying F and G was developed for use in animals and showed protection against intranasal challenge in piglets [65] . For human vaccination, vaccinia virus, adenovirus, MV and VSV [10, 35, 66, 67] have all been used as viral vectors. These vaccine candidates all elicited specific neutralizing antibodies and protected against challenge in hamster and ferret models, with VSV-NiV-G demonstrating partial protection against lethal challenge in NHPs as well, although some lesions were observed in brain cells suggesting viral replication in the central nervous system [68] .",

It is transmitted by several Aedes spp. and Culex spp. mosquitoes to livestock and humans. Infection causes acute severe disease in ruminants with fever, loss of appetite, aborted fetuses and a high mortality rate in newborn animals. Humans are dead-end hosts, and infection results in a febrile illness with approximately 1% of those infected presenting with more severe symptoms such as encephalitis or hemorrhagic syndromes. It first appeared in the Rift Valley region of Kenya and the virus itself was isolated in 1930. Several major outbreaks were reported throughout Africa, before first appearing outside the region in 2000 with a large outbreak in the Arabian peninsula.",
