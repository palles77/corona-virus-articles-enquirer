            "text": "Human surfactant protein A (SP-A) plays an important role in surfactant metabolism and lung innate immunity. SP-A is synthesized and secreted by alveolar type II cells (ATII), one of the two cell types of the distal lung epithelium (ATII and ATI). We have shown that miRNA interactions with sequence polymorphisms on the SP-A mRNA 3\u2032UTRs mediate differential expression of SP-A1 and SP-A2 gene variants in vitro. In the present study, we describe a physiologically relevant model to study miRNA regulation of SP-A in human ATII. For these studies, we purified and cultured human ATII on an air-liquid interface matrix (A/L) or plastic wells without matrix (P). Gene expression analyses confirmed that cells cultured in A/L maintained the ATII phenotype for over 5 days, whereas P-cultured cells differentiated to ATI. When we transfected ATII with siRNAs to inhibit the expression of Drosha, a critical effector of miRNA maturation, the levels of SP-A mRNA and protein increased in a time dependent manner. We next characterized cultured ATII and ATI by studying expression of 1,066 human miRNAs using miRNA PCR arrays. We detected expression of >300 miRNAs with 24 miRNAs differentially expressed in ATII vs. ATI, 12 of which predicted to bind SP-A 3\u2032UTRs, indicating that these may be implicated in SP-A downregulation in ATI. Thus, miRNAs not only affect SPA expression, but also may contribute to the maintenance of the ATII cell phenotype and/or the trans-differentiation of ATII to ATI cells, and may represent new molecular markers that distinguish ATII and ATI.",

Two homologous genes encode human SP-A: SFTPA1 (SP-A1) and SFTPA2 (SP-A2). Based on sequence differences at the coding region, several coding variants have been identified and characterized for SP-A1 and SP-A2, some of which have been associated with lung disease susceptibility and/or pathogenesis in neonates, children, and adults (3) . We have previously reported biochemical and functional differences among SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants in several experimental models (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . We have also shown that the ratio of SP-A1 to total SP-A protein is altered in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of subjects with lung disease vs. healthy individuals, indicating that the overall SP-A functional activity may depend on the relative amounts of SP-A1 and SP-A2 gene products (14, 15) . Together, these findings indicate that a controlled regulation of SP-A1 and SP-A2 expression is critical to maintain lung homeostasis and prevent disease.",

Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that differential regulation of SP-A variants occurs at both transcriptional and translational levels (16) (17) (18) (19) . Recently, using the NCI-H441 cell line, we have reported that differential miRNA regulation of SP-A variants depends on sequence polymorphisms at the 3\u2032UTR of SP-A variants (20) . However, differences may exist in the physiology, regulatory pathways, and overall gene expression between NCI H441 and ATII cells. Thus, a more physiologically relevant model is needed to elucidate and/or confirm the molecular mechanisms that control the expression of SP-A. We aim to accomplish this by using primary cultures of human ATII cells from lung donors.",

Moreover, human ATII cells have been shown to trans-differentiate to alveolar type I cells (ATI) in cultures from various species (23, 24) . Differentiation of ATII to ATI can be detected by changes in the overall cell morphology, the loss of lamellar bodies (detected by modified Papanicolaou staining, ultrastructure analysis, etc.), or by detection of molecular markers that allow the identification of these two distinct cell types (25) . The most commonly used ATII cell specific markers are: Surfactant Protein C (STPC), ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 3 (ABCA3), and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1); whereas the molecular markers commonly used for identification of ATI are Caveolin-1 (CAV1), T1\u03b1 (PDPN), Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), and Aquaporin-5 (AQP-5) (2, 26, 27) .",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression via translation suppression by binding sequence motifs on mRNA 3\u2032UTRs. MiRNA biogenesis initiates in the nucleus, where precursors (pri-miRNAs) are transcribed by the RNA polymerase II, and processed onto pre-miRNAs via cleavage by a complex of enzymes including Drosha (28) . Pre-miRNAs are transported by exportin-5 to the cytosol, where further processing by the ribonuclease Dicer results in double-stranded 19-25nt molecules containing the mature miRNA (miR), and the complimentary miRNA (miR*). The mature miR interacts with the mRNA target by sequence complementarity of the seed region (7 8nt) to the 3\u2032UTR. The miR-mRNA complex interacts with proteins of the Argonaut family leading to the assembly of the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) (28) . The degree of sequence complementarity between miRNA and mRNA targets is known to determine whether repression of protein expression is mediated by mRNA degradation (perfect match), or inhibition of translation (imperfect match) (29) .",

By using a knockdown approach to inhibit miRNA biogenesis, we provide evidence that miRNAs regulate expression of SP-A. Moreover, we show for the first time that differences exist in the miRNA cellular content of human ATII and ATI cultured cells. Our findings support the notion that differential expression of miRNAs may regulate respiratory functions not only through regulation of SP-A gene expression, but also differentiation of alveolar epithelial cells, as well as point to a possible role of miRNAs in SP-A downregulation in ATI cells.",

These results are in support of previous findings on differential regulation of the two SP-A genes (41) (42) (43) . Expression of SFTPB (SP-B), SFTPC (SP-C) and SFTPD (SP-D) mRNAs was also significantly higher on D4 and D5 in A/L cultures. On the other hand, ATII cells cultured in P showed a significant decrease in the mRNA expression of all surfactant protein genes over time, and these were not affected by the addition of Dex (Supplementary Figure 2) . Together, these results indicate that ATII cells are able to maintain the phenotype over time when cultured in A/L, as shown previously (34, 36) , and represent a suitable experimental model for the study of surfactant protein expression.",

Prediction target analysis using the online tool TargetScan showed that eleven miRNAs exclusively expressed in ATII cells were predicted to bind SP-A transcripts (3 for SP-A1, 3 for SP-A2, and 5 for both genes), and 52 miRNAs expressed only in ATI cells had predicted binding to SP-A 3\u2032UTRs (14 for SP-A1, 13 for SP-A2, and 15 for both genes) ( Table 2) .

Our goal here was to develop a model that will allow the study of the regulation of human SP-A variants in a physiologically relevant system (i.e. in a normal, non cancerous cell model where SP-A is naturally expressed). We used a combination of published protocols and techniques to obtain ATII cells from a donor lung, and tested two cell culture conditions that resulted in two distinct phenotypes after 5 days. In A/L cultures, addition of keratinocyte growth factor, isubutylmethylxanthine, and 8-Br-cAMP resulted in increased levels of total SP-A. Media supplementation with Dex, on the other hand, significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of all surfactant proteins. These changes were not observed in cells cultured in the absence of matrix (P). These results were not unexpected, as both matrigel (primarily composed of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor matrix), and rat tail collagen have been shown to stimulate synthesis and secretion of surfactant phospholipids and maintainance of SPA expression in cultured ATII cells (22, 49, 50) .",

Currently, the mechanisms involved in this process are unknown, although recent studies have identified a role of TGF-\u03b2, and bone morphogenic protein (BPM) signaling pathways in the control of the trans-differentiation rate (44) . In the present study, we have shown that ATII cells cultured for 5 days in plastic wells are able to trans-differentiate to ATI, as indicated by surfactant protein expression and three ATI specific markers, and cell morphology consistent with the ATI phenotype. In addition, we have shown differences in the expression of miRNAs in ATII and ATI cells ( Table 1 ), indicating that miRNAs could play a role in the trans-differentiation process, by affecting the regulation of multiple genes, as it has been previously shown for bronchial epithelial cell differentiation (52) . It is also possible that the differential miRNA composition of ATI and ATII cells, as well as the differential expression rates for the 24 miRNAs identified (Table 3 ) may represent a novel molecular marker for identification of these two distinct cell phenotypes. Moreover, given the fact that a number of miRNAs that were highly expressed in ATI vs. ATII cells were predicted to bind SP-A 3\u2032UTRs, it is possible that these pay a role in the downregulation of SP-A1 and SP-A2 in the ATI phenotype.",

The nuclear protein Drosha is a key regulator of this process, as its cleavage of miRNA precursors allows them to enter the cytosol and continue the miRNA biogenesis process. Therefore, by depleting Drosha from ATII cells, one can decrease the miRNA biogenesis rate, and thus minimize the effects of mature miRNAs in the cell. In the current study, we successfully inhibited the expression of Drosha by using a siRNA-mediated approach in ATII cells maintained in A/L, and were able to show for the first time that a) ATII cells can be efficiently transfected in cell monolayers; b) knock-down of Drosha results in significantly higher mRNA and protein levels of surfactant proteins, indicating that miRNAs are involved (directly or indirectly) in the regulation of surfactant protein expression, and c) alveolar epithelial type I and II cells differentially express miRNAs predicted to regulate the expression of SP-A genes. Future research is needed to confirm the mechanisms by which miRNAs affect SP-A translation and mRNA stability.",

            "text": "MicroRNAs are powerful regulators of gene expression, as they have the ability of controlling multiple targets simultaneously, and affect various cellular functions and biological processes, including cell differentiation in various tissues (53) (54) (55) (56) . In the present study, the miRNA profile of ATII cells was significantly different from that of ATI cells after 5 days in culture ( Figure 5 ). Qualitative analysis revealed 37 ATII-specific miRNAs and 180 specific for ATI cells (Table 1) , and differential expression of 24 miRNAs in ATI vs. ATII (Table 3) . Together, these indicate a role of miRNAs in ATII and ATI phenotypes. In order to determine some of the regulatory pathways that may be under the control of these miRNAs, we used the online Tool for Annotations of miRNAs (TAM) (40) to evaluate associations of differentially expressed miRNAs with various biological functions. Among the miRNAs with exclusive expression in ATII cells, two (hsa-mir-92a, hsa-mir-19b) belong to the hsa-mir-17-92 family, previously shown to inhibit lung epithelial cell differentiation (57) . Furthermore, fourteen miRNAs with exclusive expression in ATI cells are members of the hsa-mir-1185 cluster (hsa-mir-134, hsa-mir-299-5p, hsa-mir-329, hsa-mir-369-3p, hsa-mir-376b, hsa-mir-377, hsa-mir-379, hsa-mir-380, hsa-mir-411, hsa-mir-485-3p, hsamir-487a, hsa-mir-495, hsa-mir-543, hsa-mir-668), indicating that they are likely to share common expression patterns, regulation of transcription and processing of pri-miRNA precursors, and regulatory functions (58, 59) . However, the underlying mechanisms for these putative functions are currently unknown. Finally, of the 24 commonly expressed miRNAs with differential expression in ATI and ATII, five were predicted to bind SP-A1 3\u2032UTRs (hsa-mir-181a-2-3p, hsa-mir-182-5p, hsa-mir-370-5p, hsa-mir-373-5p, hsamir-3907), four were predicted to bind SP-A2 3\u2032UTRs (hsa-mir-214-3p, hsa-mir-30a-5p, hsa-mir-30d-5p, hsa-mir-30e-5p), and two (hsa-mir-126-3p, hsa-mir-429) were predicted to bind regulatory sequences of both SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes. These observations indicate that an increase in the expression of these miRNAs in ATI cells may contribute to the inhibition of expression of SP-A1 and SP-A2 in cells cultured in plastic. Furthermore, TAM analysis of the 24 differentially expressed miRNAs in Table 3 revealed that two (hsa-mir-15a-5p, hsa-mir-424-5p), and three (hsa-mir-15a-5p, hsa-mir-21-3p, hsa-mir-373-5p) were associated with cell differentiation and cell proliferation, respectively. Seven miRNAs (hsamir-21-3p hsa-mir-29a-5p, hsa-mir-30a-5p, hsa-mir-30d-5p, hsa-mir-30e-5p, hsamir-370-3p, and hsa-mir-429) were associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and two (hsa-mir-96-5p, hsa-mir-182-5p) with cell fate determination. This analysis also identified miRNAs related to apoptosis (hsa-mir-15a-5p, hsa-mir-21-3p, hsa-mir-29a-5p, hsa-mir-96-5p, hsa-mir-181a-2-3p, hsa-mir-182-5p), and cell death (hsa-mir-21-3p, hsamir-30d-5p, hsa-mir-130b-3p, hsa-mir-181a-2-3p, hsa-mir-182-5p). Together, these predictions indicate that multiple biological pathways may be contributing to the ATII to ATI differentiation process observed in our model, and miRNAs may play an important role in the control of these functions, by regulation of specific gene expression. Further analyses on miRNA-mRNA pathways, as well as functional analysis of miRNA-gene interactions may reveal specific regulatory mechanisms involved in the control of alveolar cell differentiation, and determine whether these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for alveolar cell differentiation in vivo. A limitation of the present study is that the alveolar epithelial cells studied were derived from a single lung of a young donor, with a specific SP-A1 and SP-A2 genotype. It is possible that lungs from older donors and different SP-A1 and SP-A2 genotypes may behave slightly different in terms of the parameters measured here.",
