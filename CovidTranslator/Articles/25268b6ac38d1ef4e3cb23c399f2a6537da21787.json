Induction and retention of IL-15-independent memory CD8 + T cells was assessed in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 and wild-type (wt) mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) or Sindbis virus (rSIN) vectors expressing the identical foreign epitope. Both vectors induced epitope-specific CD8 + T cell expansion and function, independent of IL-15. Similar kinetics of rVV clearance confirmed effective CD8 + T cell function in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. CD44 hi CD122 hi CD8 + T cells, mainly of the CD62L \u00c0/lo phenotype, increased more dramatically and declined more rapidly in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, independent of the vector. Rapid IL-15-independent memory CD8 + T cell expansion following challenge of immune mice compensated for the limited memory CD8 + populations in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. However, despite expansion and expression of potent effector function, viral clearance was delayed in the absence of IL-15, coinciding with a rapid loss in cytolytic function. D 2004 Elsevier Inc.

            "text": "Induction of memory CD8 + T cells constitutes an important parameter of vaccine-induced protective immunity against microbial infection. CD8 + T cell memory is influenced by the magnitude of the acute response (Ahmed and Gray, 1996; Flynn et al., 1998; Hou et al., 1994; Murali-Krishna et al., 1998) , the presence of survival factors during the contraction and memory phases (Grayson et al., 2000; Jameson, 2002; Lanzavecchia and Sallusto, 2002) , and by subsequent homologous or heterologous infections (Welsh and Selin, 2002) . The majority of antigen primed memory cells appear to be replenished by proliferation, independent of class I interactions (Jameson, 2002; Murali-Krishna et al., 1999; Prlic et al., 2002) . Prominent factors regulating CD8 + memory T cell homeostasis are IL-15 and IL-7, but their roles are not necessarily overlapping . A major role for IL-15 in regulating distinct lymphocyte subsets was revealed by the absence of NK cells and diminished memory CD8 + T cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Kennedy et al., 2000) . The inability of IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice to control infection with the virulent WR strain of vaccinia virus, a lytic infection controlled by CD8 + T cells (Kennedy et al., 2000) , implied additional roles for IL-15 during the CD8 + T cell expansion, effector, or contraction phases. However, initial expansion of virus-specific responses is only marginally affected during vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection (Schluns et al., 2002) , and no defects were noted following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection (Becker et al., 2002) . Both VSV and LCMV infections were controlled and the initial virusspecific memory pool was not severely compromised. More recently, a redundant role for IL-15 during CD8 T cell expansion and virus clearance was confirmed following gammaherpes virus MHV-68 infection (Obar et al., 2004) . However, longitudinal analysis in models where virus is cleared revealed a progressive loss of virus-specific memory CD8 + T cells due to defective homeostatic renewal (Becker Schluns et al., 2002) . The slowly dividing residual memory CD8 + T cells were nevertheless capable of recall cytokine responses and control of secondary viral challenge (Becker et al., 2002) . By contrast, IL-15 was not required for homeostatic maintenance of virus-specific memory CD8 T cells following latent MHV-68 infection (Obar et al., 2004) . IL-15 overexpression confirmed a positive regulatory role, specifically in memory CD8 + T cell homeostasis (Yajima et al., 2002) . However, if given during a secondary response, IL-15 may have detrimental effects on preexisting, nonboosted memory T cells (Chapdelaine et al., 2003) , questioning the adjuvant effect of IL-15 for vaccination purposes.",

            "text": "IL-15-dependent and -independent CD44 hi CD8 + memory populations are not only evident following viral infection, but also in naive wt mice (Judge et al., 2002) . These populations vary prominently in expression of the IL-15Rh chain, CD122, which together with the common IL-2/ IL-15R g c chain is shared by the IL-2R (Nelson and Willerford, 1998) . In wt mice, IL-15-dependent CD122 hi memory CD8 + T cells constitute the most prominent subset, whereas the minor IL-15-independent subset is CD122 lo (Judge et al., 2002) . VSV-and LCMV-specific memory CD8 + T cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice are also severely impaired in the CD122 hi subset (Becker et al., 2002; Schluns et al., 2002) . Importantly, IL-15 is not required to convert naRve antigen-specific CD122 lo CD8 + T cells into CD122 hi cells during antigen-driven expansion/activation (Judge et al., 2002) . However, a rapid decline of the CD122 hi population in the absence of IL-15 is consistent with a role of IL-15 in promoting survival by up-regulating the anti apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 (Wu et al., 2002) . CD122 inhibition only decreased turnover by~50%, suggesting an IL-15-and IL-2-independent pathway for sustaining CD8 + T cell memory (Ku et al., 2000) . Indeed IL-2Rh-deficient mice, incapable of either IL-2-or IL-15-mediated signaling, mount primary and secondary CD8 + T cell responses, albeit with limited effector function (Yu et al., 2003) . IL-15-independent survival of memory CD8 + T cells may be partially attributed to IL-7 (Goldrath et al., 2002; Jameson, 2002; Prlic et al., 2002; Tan et al., 2002) . However, while a clear role for IL-7 in homeostasis was not confirmed in IL-7-deficient mice, deprivation of both IL-15 and IL-7 completely inhibited homeostatic proliferation (Goldrath et al., 2002; Ku et al., 2000; Tan et al., 2002) .",

These prototype DNA and RNA vectors were chosen based on their differential susceptibilities to IFNa/h and CD8 + T cell immunity. IFNa/h, a strong inducer of IL-15 severely, limits SIN replication and spread (Ryman et al., 2000) , whereas CD8 + T cells control rVV infection (Binder and Kqndig, 1991) . Although primed by alphaviruses, CD8 + T cells do not appear to play a prominent role in providing in vivo protection (Linn et al., 1998) . Nevertheless, despite the paucity of anti Sindbis virus CD8 + T cell responses (M\u00fcllbacher and Blanden, 1978) , rSIN vectors efficiently prime protective CD8 + T cells to foreign microbial epitopes (Tsuji et al., 1998; Villacres et al., 2000) . IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 and wt mice were infected with the respective recombinant viruses expressing the D b restricted S510 epitope derived from the murine coronavirus spike protein as an index epitope (Bergmann et al., 1996) . Primary epitope-specific CD8 + T cell responses in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were similar to wt mice independent of the vector, confirming that IL-15 does not affect primary CD8 + T cell effector function (Becker et al., 2002) . A dramatic increase in CD122 hi CD44 hi CD8 + T cells further supported the redundancy for IL-15 in expanding this phenotype. Although the rapid emergence of the CD122 hi CD44 hi CD8 + T cell subset was transient in the absence of IL-15, the frequency of antigen-specific memory CD8 + T cells remained similar to wt mice, independent of the type of infection. Maintenance of virus-specific memory CD8 + T cells thus appears to be independent of virusinduced factors and governed by constraints similar to those that regulate endogenous memory CD8 + T cells. The data demonstrate that rapid expansion of IL-15-independent CD8 + T cells into potent effector CD8 + T cells upon primary or secondary antigen challenge compensates for impaired IL-15-driven homeostatic maintenance of antigenspecific memory CD8 + T cells.",

Unlike vaccinia virus (Kennedy et al., 2000) , acute VSV, LCMV, and MHV-68 infections were controlled, despite reduced expansion of VSV-specific CD8 + T cells in the absence of IL-15 (Becker et al., 2002; Obar et al., 2004; Schluns et al., 2002) . To assess whether IL-15-independent CD8 + T cell responses are influenced by the type of viral infection, rVV or rSIN expressing the heterologous S510 indicator epitope were tested as immunogens in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 and wt mice. No significant differences in the relative percentages of S510specific cells within splenic CD8 + T cells from IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 and wt mice were evident during the acute response to either vJS510 or SINJS510 (Figs. 1A and B). Frequencies of tetramer + cells within the CD8 + T cell population remained similar throughout days 6-8 during the response to vJS510. While the absolute numbers of S510-specific CD8 + T cells were also similar in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 compared to wt mice following vJS510 infection, they were consistently reduced following SINJS510 infection (Fig. 1C) . These differential effects, and the overall higher numbers of S510-specific T cells following rVV infection, likely reside in the more robust host CD8 + T cell response to rVV compared to rSIN (Villacres et al., 2000) .",

Similar to tetramer analysis, no significant differences in percentages of CD8 + T cells secreting IFN-g in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 and wt mice were detected following either vJS510 or SINJS510 priming, respectively. Neither vector induced detectable ex vivo S510-specific cytolytic activity during acute infection (data not shown). However, the cytolytic potency of splenocytes from rVV-infected mice was identical in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 and wt mice following 4 days in vitro activation (Fig. 2B) and was only slightly reduced in cultures derived from IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at day 6. Thus, there was no evidence for impaired epitope-specific CD8 + T cell expansion or function following infection of IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with these two distinct recombinant vectors. However, IL-15 is pivotal in regulating NK cell and NK T cell activities (Kennedy et al., 2000) . In addition, IL-15 secretion by activated macrophages, dendritic cells, and stromal cells may affect other early events during viral infection (Fawaz et al., 1999; Fehniger and Caligiuri, 2000; Mattei et al., 2001; Nguyen et al., 2002) . Nevertheless, rVV was cleared from ovaries of infected IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with the same kinetics as in wt mice (Fig. 3) . Therefore, the absence of IL-15 did not impair the primary antiviral response governed by CD8 + T cell immunity, as exemplified by rVV infection.",

Splenocytes obtained at the peak of the acute responses, day 8 pi for vJS510 and day 6 for SINJS510, were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 mAb and PE-conjugated D b -S510 tetramer and compared to splenocytes from naRve controls.

Black bars represent wt and white bars IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. The data are representative of three to four independent experiments. naRve T cell numbers, thus suggested a compensatory effect during expansion. Both IL-2 and IL-15 promote T cell expansion, although these two cytokines differentially regulate CD8 + T cell differentiation (Manjunath et al., 2001) . IL-2 is secreted during both viral infections (Villacres et al., 2000) and may thus exert more activity in the absence of IL-15. CD8 + T cells were analyzed for expression of the IL-2R/IL-15R h chain, CD122, in conjunction with the activation markers CD44 and CD62L. In naRve wt mice, CD122 is predominantly expressed on CD44 hi and CD62L hi CD8 + T cells (Fig.  4A ). By contrast, the severe reduction of CD44 hi cells coincident with reduced CD122 hi CD8 + T cells in naRve IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Fig. 4A ) is consistent with constitutive IL-15driven CD122 expression in the memory CD8 + T cell subset. By contrast, low CD122 levels on naRve T cells in both groups suggests that CD122 up-regulation during infection may reflect IL-2-driven expansion in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Indeed, CD122 was strongly up-regulated on splenic CD8 + T cells following both infections, resulting in nearly equivalent CD122 hi CD8 + T cell populations in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 and wt mice (Fig. 4B ). Taking the already existing CD122 hi endogenous memory population in wt mice into account, these data suggest that naRve CD8 + T cells respond more vigorously in the absence of IL-15. Enhanced CD8 + T cell activation and expansion was confirmed by both similar levels of CD44 hi CD8 + T cell subsets in infected IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 compared to wt mice, irrespective of the preexisting memory pool in naRve wt mice, and more prominent CD62L down-regulation in CD8 + T cells from infected IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Fig. 4B) . Finally, infected IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibited a significantly higher proportion of CD43 + CD8 + T cells, associated with expression of CD8 + T cell effector function (Harrington et al., 2000) . Analysis of the expression of five markers associated with T cell activation thus revealed enhanced CD8 + T cell responsiveness following infection of IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. A substantial loss of CD62L expression and increased CD43 expression by CD8 + T cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was especially pronounced following rSIN infection. Overall, increased frequencies of activated CD8 + T cells following rVV compared to rSIN infection likely reflect the more virulent nature of the infection (Villacres et al., 2000) .",

CD44 hi CD122 hi CD8 + T cells comprised~20% of CD8 + T cells, constituting a 10-fold increase compared to naRve mice. By contrast, this population only increased slightly (from 17% to 22%) in infected wt mice. Furthermore, while the majority (72%) of CD122 hi CD8 + T cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice lacked CD62L expression, only 33% of CD122 hi CD8 + T cells in wt mice expressed a CD62L lo/\u00c0 phenotype (Fig. 4C ). This population presumably reflects recently activated cells, as CD62L is down-regulated during activation and remains low on a substantial population of memory CD8 + T cells (Tripp et al., 1995; Wherry et al., Fig. 3 . Clearance of rVV is not impaired in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Wt (solid squares) and IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (open circles) were infected intraperitoneally with 5 \u00c2 10 7 PFU vJS510.

Dot plots, gated on CD8 T cells, are representative of three to four individual mice. IFN-g + CD8 + T cells are confined by a rectangle and their percentages within CD8 + T cells indicated. IFN-g staining of unstimulated CD8 + T cells was below 0.5%. (B) Splenocytes from vJS510 immunized mice harvested at day 5 pi were cultured in the presence of 1AM peptide S510 and tested for S510-specific cytolytic activity at day 4 (left panel) and day 6 (right panel) using S510 peptidecoated or untreated EL-4 cells as targets. Lysis of untreated targets was below 5%. Data are representative of two independent experiments. 2003). Reversion of a subset of virus-specific memory cells to the CD62L hi phenotype (Wherry et al., 2003) suggests that the CD122 hi CD62L hi subset in wt naRve mice (Fig. 4A) represents preestablished memory cells. The more prominent expansion/accumulation of CD8 + T cells with a classic CD44 hi CD122 hi CD62L lo/\u00c0 activation phenotype in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 compared to wt mice was also observed following rVV infection (data not shown).",

To determine how the absence of IL-15 influenced the CD8 + T cell contraction phase following viral infection, the relative proportion of CD44 hi CD8 + T cells was measured throughout the acute response to rVV infection. Total CD8 + T cell percentages in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice increased threefold by day 6 postinfection (pi), reaching levels similar to those found in wt mice (Fig. 5) . CD8 + T cell decline was already clearly evident by day 8 pi and by day 10 pi had decreased to~50% of those in wt mice. The increase in total CD8 + T cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at day 6 pi was largely attributed to activated CD8 + T cells. Relative to naRve mice, the overall increase in activation marker expression was more prominent on CD8 + T cells derived from IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Whereas the CD44 hi subset increased 20-fold in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice by day 6 pi, it increased only eightfold in wt mice (Fig. 5A) . The progressive decline in CD8 + T cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice by day 12 pi correlated with an increased loss of CD44 hi CD8 + T cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 versus wt mice. Similar to increased CD44 expression, CD122 expression was maximal at~70% of CD8 + T cells by day 6 pi, independent of IL-15 (Fig. 5B) . However, the CD122 hi phenotype was lost more rapidly than the CD44 hi phenotype in both groups. The rapid increase and subsequent decrease of CD122 + CD8 + T cells in infected IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice are emphasized by presenting total numbers per spleen (Fig. 5C ).",

The magnitude of S510-specific memory CD8 + T cell responses, and their recall responses, was thus examined in a secondary challenge model.

IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice revealed no impairment in memory CD8 + T cell expansion compared to wt mice (Fig. 7A) . Total numbers of tetramer + CD8 + T cells were prominent by day 4 pi, comprising~20% and 35% of CD8 + T cells in wt and IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, respectively. Numbers further increased slightly to day 6 pi, when tetramer percentages were maximal within the CD8 population. Total numbers remained elevated through day 10 postchallenge. Similar to the primary response, CD8 + T cell activation coincided with a more prominent increase of CD122 hi cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Furthermore, frequencies of antigen-specific IFN-g secreting CD8 + T cells were similar in challenged IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 and wt mice, suggesting no defects in functional responsiveness (Fig.  7B ). In contrast to the primary rVV response, secondary CD8 + T cell responses in rSIN primed mice were associated with ex vivo S510-specific cytolytic activity in both wt and IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Fig. 7C ). Consistent with a higher percentage of tetramer + CD8 + T cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, cytolysis was also elevated compared to wt mice at day 6 pi. Adjustment of E:T ratios to tetramer + CD8 + T cells further indicated that enhanced cytolytic activity was not solely explicable by higher frequencies, suggesting increased cytolytic capacity at the single cell level. Nevertheless, increased cytolytic activity was transient in the IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and decreased to levels below those exhibited by cells from wt mice by day 8 pi. By day 10 pi, ex vivo cytolytic activity had decreased to barely detectable levels in both groups (Fig. 7C) . Despite efficient Fig. 5 . Kinetics of primary CD8 + T cell responses to vJS510 infection in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mouse. Splenocytes from naRve and vJS510-infected wt (B6, gray bars) and IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (white bars) were analyzed for CD44 (A) and CD122 (B) expression on CD8 + T cells at the indicated time points pi. Each full-length bar represents the average percentage of CD8 + T cells within total splenocytes. The portion of CD44 hi CD8 + T cells or CD122 hi CD8 + T cells, respectively, is indicated by striped portions in each bar. SD were below 10% of the average and are not shown. (C) Bars indicate total numbers of CD122 hi CD8 + T cells per spleen F SD (n = 3-4 mice). expansion and expression of effector function by memory cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, viral clearance was delayed compared to wt mice (Fig. 8) . Although replication at all time points was reduced in both groups compared to naive mice (see Fig. 3 ), residual virus was still detectable in both ovaries of all challenged IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice by day 14 pi. In contrast, the majority of wt mice had cleared virus to levels below detection by day 12 pi. Similar results were obtained when mice were primed with a 10-fold higher dose of SINJS510. Thus, rapid, but transient accumulation of S510-specific CD8 + T cells upon challenge is insufficient to provide optimal viral protection in the absence of IL-15. The reduced frequency of epitope-specific memory CD8 + T cells, in addition to their apparent premature loss of cytolytic function, may contribute to the delayed viral clearance. IL-15-independent memory CD8 + T cells are Fig. 7 . Functional recall responses of memory CD8 + T cells in the absence of IL-15. Wt and IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice primed with 5 \u00c2 10 7 PFU SINJS510 were challenged with 1 \u00c2 10 7 PFU vJS510 6 weeks post-SINJS510 immunization. (A) Reactivation of S510-specific CD8 + T cells was determined in splenocytes by tetramer staining at the indicated time points.

(B) Representative plots of three mice per group comparing tetramer + and IFN-g + CD8 + populations at the peak of the response at day 6. IC IFN-g staining was performed as in Fig. 2 . Similar results were observed in two other separate experiments. (C) S510-specific ex vivo cytolytic activity of reactivated CD8 + T cells post-vJS510 challenge. Splenocytes were directly tested for cytolysis of peptide-coated EL-4 target cells without in vitro stimulation at the indicated time points postchallenge. Solid squares represent wt and open circles IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 splenocytes. E:T ratios are presented on the x-axis based on the entire splenocyte population or calculated per tetramer + cell as indicated by ratios above the symbols. Fig. 6 .

Both IL-2 and IL-15 support T cell proliferation after in vitro activation. However, IL-2 signaling induces high levels of T cell activation and expression of effector markers, whereas T cells stimulated by IL-15 resemble memory cells (Manjunath et al., 2001) . While IL-2 is a growth factor, it also down-regulates highly activated CD8 + T cells by enhancing activation-induced cell death (Cousens et al., 1995; Kundig et al., 1993 , Marks-Konczalik et al., 2000 Waldman et al., 2001) . By contrast, IL-15 plays a minor role in CD8 + T cell expansion but contributes significantly to proliferative renewal and survival of memory CD8 + T cells (Becker et al., 2002; Schluns et al., 2002) . The reduction of primary CD8 + T cell responses to VSV infection (Schluns et al., 2002) , but not LCMV or MHV-68 infection (Becker et al., 2002; Obar et al., 2004) in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, suggested that the type of viral infection may influence IL-15dependent CD8 + T cell activation. Indeed, distinct viruses induce different levels of IL-15 in human PMBC (Fawaz et al., 1999) , suggesting that the immune system may have adapted to different types of viral infections by distinct IL-15 and NK cell-dependent responses.",

Similar frequencies of S510-specific cells in CD8 + splenocytes from rVV-infected IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 and wt mice support the notion that the absence of IL-15 does not impede CD8 + T cell responses to a viral infection associated with potent inflammatory responses. Although alphaviruses are strong inducers of type I interferons (Ryman et al., 2000) and thus IL-15 expression (Mattei et al., 2001; Nguyen et al., 2002) , the absence of IL-15 also did not impair S510-specific CD8 + T cell induction following rSIN immunization. Nevertheless, reduced absolute numbers of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells per spleen following VSV (Schluns et al., 2002) and rSIN infection of IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice suggest that IL-15 may play a more prominent role in these viral infections compared to rVV and LCMV (Becker et al., 2002) .",

NaRve CD44 lo CD8 + T cells express little CD122 in either uninfected IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 or wt mice. Therefore, substantially increased numbers of CD122 hi CD8 + T cells during both infections relative to naRve mice likely reflects a compensatory mechanism. The CD122 IL-2R/IL-15R h chain is uniquely shared by IL-2 and IL-15 (Fehninger and Caligiuri, 2000; Nelson and Willerford, 1998) , suggesting the possibility of enhanced IL-2 responsiveness in the absence of competing IL-15. Both rVV and rSIN induce substantial IL-2 secretion by CD4 + T cells (Villacres et al., 2000) , likely promoting CD8 + T cell expansion. This notion is supported by increased IL-2R a chain (CD25) expression on CD8 + T cells derived from IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (data not shown). A subset of the CD122 hi population may constitute CD8 + T cells specific for the vector virus in the case of rVV; however, SIN-induced responses have not been identified in H-2 b mice (M\u00fcllbacher and Blanden, 1978) . The observation that the CD122 hi population substantially exceeded the S510-specific population thus implies that CD122 upregulation not only reflects virus-specific CD8 + T cells, but indicates a bystander effect, potentially enhancing proliferation of heterologous memory CD8 + T cells. Despite an apparent role for CD122 during CD8 + T cell activation, IL-2-and IL-15-independent proliferation and differentiation of CD8 + T cells were recently demonstrated using OT-1 TCR-transgenic T cells (Teague et al., 2004) . Furthermore, rVV infection of mice deficient in both IL-2 and IL-15 signaling induced surprisingly effective antigen-specific cell expansion (Yu et al., 2003) . Although these data substantiate cytokine redundancy in promoting CD8 + T cell activation, the absence of IL-2Rh signaling severely impaired CD8 + T cell IFN-g secretion (Yu et al., 2003) . The redundancy of IL-15 in antigen-induced IFN-g secretion in our results is consistent with a prominent role of IL-2, but not IL-15, in enhancing IFN-g production during anti-viral responses (Seder et al., 1994; Su et al., 1998) .",

The notion that IL- Fig. 8 . Delayed clearance of vJS510 in SINJS510-primed IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Mice primed with 5 \u00c2 10 7 PFU SINJS510 were challenged with 5 \u00c2 10 7 PFU vJS510 6 weeks later.

Whether this is due to increased IL-2-driven apoptosis or the inability of IL-15 to counteract apoptosis is unclear (Wu et al., 2002) . However, the disproportionately faster decline of CD122 hi compared to CD44 hi CD8 + T cells in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice favors the latter. The presence of S510-specific memory CD8 + T cells established following either rVV or rSIN infection at 6 weeks pi in the absence of IL-15 confirmed IL-15independent survival of a memory CD8 + T cell subset. The possibility that superior CD4 + T cell helper responses contribute to effective maintenance of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in the absence of IL-15 was excluded based on identical activation of CD4 + T cells in both types of mice throughout infection (data not shown). Thus, it remains unclear if survival of IL-15-independent antigen-specific CD8 + T cells is mediated by IL-7, which has been implicated in maintaining both naRve and memory CD8 + T cells (Goldrath et al., 2002; Kieper et al., 2002; Prlic et al., 2002) .",

Furthermore, consistent with VSV and LCMV infections (Becker et al., 2002; Schluns et al., 2002) , IL-15 was not absolutely required to establish a functional antigen-specific memory CD8 + T cell population. Efficient induction and expansion of both primary and recall CD8 + T cell responses was tightly linked with CD122 expression and down-regulation of CD62L, suggesting a transient role for IL-2 in CD8 + T cell activation in the absence of IL-15. Nevertheless, reduced protective immunity to challenge in IL-15 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice compared to wt mice was associated with both an accelerated loss of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells and cytolytic potency on a per cell basis. These data suggested a critical role of IL-15 in maintaining effector function in highly activated antigen-specific CD8 + T cells.",

Representative plots of three to four individual mice of each group are shown. (A) Three-color stains of naRve splenocytes using CyChromeC-conjugated anti-CD8, PE-conjugated anti-CD122, and FITCconjugated CD44 (top panel) or CDL2L (bottom panel). Plots are gated on CD8 + T cells; numbers depict percentages within in each quadrant. (B) Splenocytes obtained from vJS510-infected mice at day 8 pi and SINJS510-infected mice at day 6 pi were surface stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 and PEconjugated anti-CD122, CD44, CD62L, or CD43. Plots are gated on live total lymphocytes; numbers represent the relative percentages of activated cells within the CD8 + T cell population. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. (C) Splenocytes obtained from SINJS510-infected mice at day 6 pi were analyzed as described above in panel A.",
