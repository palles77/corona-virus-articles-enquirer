NEUROTOXICOL TERATOL 16(6) 583-591, 1994.--3,3 '-Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) has been reported to disrupt learning and memory in rats (24). The present work addressed the effects of IDPN on tasks requiring the use of spatial information. Separate groups of male rats were dosed with IDPN (IP, in 1 ml/kg saline) for 3 consecutive days and tested in the following procedures: (a) step-through passive avoidance conditioning (0, 100, 150, and 200 mg/kg/ day); (b) Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition and retention (0, 125, 150, 175, and 200 mg/kg/day); (c) radial arm maze (RAM) acquisition (0, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (d) RAM steady-state performance (0, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day); (e) repeated acquisition in the RAM (0, and 200 mg/kg/day). The vestibular toxicity of IDPN resulted in alterations in spontaneous behavior or swimming deficits in 5 of 8 rats treated with 175 mg/kg/day and in all the animals dosed with 200 or 400 nag/ kg/day. IDPN increased step-through PA latencies at 200 mg/kg/day but not at lower doses. In the MWM, no performance deficits were observed at the dose levels preserving the swimming ability of the animals. In both the acquisition and the steady-state RAM tasks, IDPN (400 mg/kg/day) induced an increase in both choice errors and perseverative errors. In the RAM repeated acquisition paradigm, IDPN (200 mg/kg/day) induced performance deficits that included a decreased rate of within-session reduction in errors. The present data show that IDPN disrupts performance of tasks requiring spatial learning and memory and indicate that these deficits can be in part caused by an acquisition deficit.",

Perhaps the most widely characterized effect is the occurrence of swelfings in the proximal portion of axons (4, 5) due to an accumulation of neurofilament proteins consequent to deleterious effects of the chemical on their axonal transport (14) . Evidence also exists indicating that IDPN affects several sensory systems including the visual ( 16, 31) , olfactory (10) , auditory (6) , and vestibular (20) systems. In the CNS, the giant axonal swelfings have been seen at levels as high as the mesencephalon (4), but initial neuropathological assessments of IDPN-exposed rats failed to reveal evidence of neuronal degeneration (4, 30) . However, recent data indicate that the chemical may indeed cause significant neuronal degeneration in cortical areas (18) . Laboratory rodents exposed to IDPN display a syndrome of permanent abnormalities in spontaneous behavior. The IDPN syndrome is characterized by repetitive head movements, retropulsion, circling, and hyperactivity (6, 7, 17, 33) , and has been recently identified as a consequence of the vestibular toxicity of the compound (20) . In addition to the sensory and motoric effects, recent evidence suggests that IDPN also may have deleterious effects on cognitive processing (24) . In that study, a 3-day administration of IDPN produced a pro-Requests for reprints should be addressed to Dr. Jordi Llorens at his present address: Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, CSIC, Jordi 08034 Barcelona, Spain.",

Although Peele et al. (24) included tests as diverse as passive and active avoidance, and odor and flavor aversion conditioning, further studies are necessary to fully characterize the deficits induced by IDPN on learning and memory, and to determine the behavioral mechanisms responsible for these deficits. The aim of the present work was to study the effects of IDPN on acquisition and performance of tasks requiring learning and memory of spatial information, using the Morris water maze (MWM; 21, 22) , and the 8-arm radial arm maze (RAM; 23) . Both procedures are widely used in the study of spatial learning and memory and have been shown to provide useful animal models of the behavioral consequences of neurotoxic insults (e.g., 34, 35) . Acquisition of performance after IDPN exposure was studied in both the MWM and the RAM. In addition, the effect of IDPN on RAM steady-state performance (e.g., 25) was also studied. To determine the contribution of deficits in acquisition of new behavior in the impairments observed, the effects of IDPN on a repeated acquisition task (1,2) were studied as described by Peele and Baron (26) for the RAM. Finally, an assessment of passive avoidance (PA) was included in the present experiments to compare dose-response relationships with those of previous work (24) .",

Rats were first given pretraining and training in the standard RAM procedure as just described (25) , after which the repeated acquisition task was introduced (sessions 1-70). The experiment was terminated after session 70 due to a viral infection (rat siaodacryoadenipis/corona virus) in the animal colony. This virus causes a temporary infection of the salivary glands and in advanced stages infects the tear ducts of the eye. We had no evidence that any animals used in this experiment were infected (only a very small percentage of animals in the colony were infected), and consider it unlikely that this event affected the animals in the present study. However, the sacrifice of the entire animal colony was required to prevent further infestation and to allow sterilization of the facility. In brief, each experimental session consisted of an acclimation period (60 s), and 14 trials in which a constant set of 4 arms was baited. Trials terminated after the rat obtained all four pellets or after 400 s elapsed. Trials were separated by a 5-s intertrial interval. Rats were given saline vehicle (n = 6) or 200 mg/kg/day of IDPN (n = 8) after sessions 43 to 45.

Although 100, 125, or 150 rag/ kg/day of IDPN had no effect on behavior in the MWM, the effect of 175 mg/kg/day on escape latencies may be explained by impairment of swimming behavior. First, only 3 out of 8 animals in the 175 mg/kg/day group could be tested because of swimming deficits. Second, both the free-swim test and the interaction statistics for acquisition showed no difference between the control and the 175 mg/kg/day animals. So, whereas no effects on MWM behavior were observed at doses of IDPN that did not impair swimming, swimming deficits confounded the use of the MWM to study spatial performance in animals exposed to higher doses. In contrast to the MWM, the effects of IDPN on motor behavior did not impede the use of the RAM to study acquisition and performance of spatial tasks. Rats treated with 200 or 400 mg/kg/day of IDPN were still able to enter the arms and to collect pellets in the RAM. In the acquisition experiment, animals treated with 400 mg/kg/day of IDPN failed to reach criterion performance for total errors by the end of the experiment. These data may be explained by a failure in either: (a) emitting the appropriate responses (e.g., hyperactivity may have impeded the animals to select arms); (b) acquiring the appropriate behavior (e.g., a deficit in acquiring the test rules, constant across sessions); or (c) using session-specific informa-590 LLORENS, CROFTON AND PEELE tion (i.e., the list of arms already visited). The sequential selections (perseverative errors) data indicated that animals treated with IDPN were eventually able to reach criterion performance levels but need more sessions to reach the learning criterion. Rats treated with IDPN required more training sessions than control animals to reach criterion performance in a PA task (24) . In both cases, an ability to emit the required behavior was shown, thus suggesting the involvement of acquisition deficits in the behavioral effects of IDPN.",

In this design, IDPN disrupted the RAM performance of animals that had acquired stable performance prior to dosing. These effects of IDPN in the RAM steady-state experiment could not be due to an interference with the across-session acquisition of appropriate responses. As in the acquisition experiment, whereas the frequency of total errors remained roughly stable ( Fig. 4A and 5A) , perseverative errors tended to remit ( Fig. 4B and 5B) . The similarity between the shapes of the perseverative errors function in the acquisition and the steadystate performance RAM experiments would be easily explained by the hypothesis that they reflect a behavioral recovery: the animals in the acquisition experiment were dosed 5 weeks before the first session (Fig. 4) , whereas the animals in the steady state experiment where dosed after sessions 1 to 3 (Fig. 5) . The occurrence of perseverative errors also in the steady-state paradigm suggest that behavioral disruption (e.g., difficulties in pellet collection because of deficits in sensory or motor function) may have a role in the IDPN-induced deficits in RAM performance. The deficits induced by scopolamine in steady-state RAM performance do not involve perseverance errors (25) . However, the hypothesis of behavioral disruption does not rule out concomitant cognitive deficits in the effects of IDPN on RAM performance.",

            "text": "The data from the repeated acquisition experiment provided evidence that acquisition deficits may indeed be involved in the performance effects induced by IDPN. The motoric competence required by this task is the same as that required by the standard RAM task. However, it includes more demands on learning and memory capacities, because three levels of information must be used by the animal: (a) information relative to the test (constant across sessions); (b) the list of baited arms (constant within the 14 trials of a session but varying from session to session); (c) trial-specific information (i.e., the arms already visited within a trial). The sensitivity of repeated acquisition paradigms to toxicant-induced deficits in learning and memory has also been demonstrated in other behavioral models (e.g., the MWM, 34). As in the RAM acquisition and steady-state paradigms, the repeated-acquisition paradigm indicated that IDPN impairs performance (Fig. 6 ). An increased number of errors was still present after the animals recovered their ability to complete the task. In addition, in the repeated acquisition paradigms, acquisition may be defined as the rate of within-session decline in errors as reflected by negative index-of-curvature values. The use of the indexof-curvature statistic seems to be quite useful in quantitative assessments of behavioral acquisition as well as treatment ef-fects on acquisition (26, 32) . So the significant increases in the index-of-curvature values in the IDPN-treated animals (Fig.  6D ) provided direct evidence that IDPN did in fact impair the ability of the animals to reduce the number of errors across trials within a session, indicating the presence of a deficit in acquisition.",

            "text": "The present data thus suggest that IDPN impairs RAM performance by inducing both a behavioral disruption as well as an acquisition deficit. The toxicity of IDPN on a number of sensory systems, and its consequences on motor behavior (see Introduction), may well be responsible for the performance deficits that seem to be related to behavioral disruption. The fact that the acquisition deficits revealed by the increases in the index-of-curvature were observed at doses inducing changes in motor behavior suggest that the sensory toxicity of IDPN may be also responsible for these deficits. To our knowledge, it is not known whether sensory deficits alone may induce acquisition deficits in the repeated acquisition in the RAM. However, a case could be made that mechanisms other than sensory toxicity may contribute to the observed IDPN-induced deficits in acquisition. First, IDPN has been shown to cause deficits in amygdala kindling development (11), an experimental model of synaptic plasticity (8, 12) . Second, IDPN induced a delay-dependent deficit in a flavor aversion conditioning paradigm for which intact performance was demonstrated (24) . Both the CNS injury caused by IDPN (18) , and its effects on axonal neurofilament transport (14) might have a negative impact on synaptic plasticity leading to learning and memory deficits. Additional research is clearly required to determine the relative contribution of the different actions of IDPN to the observed deficits in acquisition.",
