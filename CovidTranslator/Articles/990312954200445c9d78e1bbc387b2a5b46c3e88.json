He had undergone bilateral lung transplantation (cytomegalovirus [CMV]: donor\u00fe, recipient\u00fe; Epstein-Barr virus: donor\u00fe; recipient\u00fe) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) 18 months prior. His posttransplant course was fairly unremarkable until 1 month earlier, when he was admitted for breathlessness and weakness. CT of the chest during that admission revealed mild intralobular and interlobular septal thickening. A bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial biopsies did not show acute cellular rejection, but the BAL fluid was positive for coronavirus. His cortisol level was undetectable; he was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and fludrocortisone was initiated. He was taking prednisone, tacrolimus, and everolimus for immunosuppression and valganciclovir, itraconazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for antimicrobial prophylaxis. His 25-lb weight loss occurred over the span of just one month. ",

CT of the chest showed bilateral, small, layering pleural effusions as well as a new left-sided loculated pleural effusion with diffuse interlobular and intralobular septal thickening that were more prominent compared with prior CT imaging (Figs 1A and 1B) . Also noted were new mild reticulonodular opacities. No evidence of enlarged thoracic lymphadenopathy or lung masses was observed. A left thoracentesis revealed 200 mL of pale yellow exudative fluid without evidence of lymphocytosis. Cytology of the pleural fluid did not reveal malignant cells. Because of these negative results, a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lung biopsy was performed (Figs 2A-C) .",

Lung cancer after lung transplantation is generally rare, with a reported incidence of 1.0% to 4.1%. Individuals who undergo lung transplantation for diseases such as COPD and IPF have a higher chance of developing primary lung malignancy because of smoking history; those with fibrotic lung diseases (eg, IPF) are also at increased risk because of the fibrotic interstitial process. Recipients of single lung transplants and those with a smoking history > 60 pack-years are at the highest risk of developing lung cancer after transplantation. In addition, donors frequently have a history of smoking, which may increase the odds of lung cancer development after lung transplantation. Posttransplant immunosuppression that includes calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), antimetabolite drugs (mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine), and prednisone also increases the risk of developing malignancy after transplantation because these drugs reduce the body's natural antitumor responses.",

Foreign material, including tumor cells, can enter the venous and lymphatic systems of the lung, causing local lymphatic vessel obstruction and fluid accumulation. This in turn leads to thickening of the alveolar septae and the bronchovascular bundles, giving rise to the typical radiographic pattern of diffuse intralobular and interlobular septal thickening. The true incidence of lymphangitic carcinomatosis is unknown, but less than 1% of all solid tumors present with this pattern. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis can occur in adenocarcinomas from the breast, kidney, lung, and gastrointestinal tract (ie, liver, pancreas, and stomach). Lymphangitic carcinomatosis is an end-stage manifestation of disease that carries extremely poor prognosis.",

Tissue diagnosis is key because the clinical presentations associated with this radiographic feature are quite diverse. Bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial lung biopsies are likely the first diagnostic modalities for obtaining tissue, as many modalities for differential diagnoses (eg, acute cellular or antibody-mediated rejection, CMV pneumonitis, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, recurrence of primary disease) have high diagnostic yields. Although the specific yield of transbronchial biopsies in lymphangitic carcinomatosis has been sparsely studied, its average diagnostic yield is thought to be about 60%. Positron emission tomography has demonstrated high specificity for detecting lymphangitic carcinomatosis, especially when it is not close to the primary tumor. VATS remains the procedure of choice for obtaining lung biopsies in patients who can tolerate the surgical procedure or when no other evidence points to the diagnosis.",
