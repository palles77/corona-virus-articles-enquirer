Although a recent review stated that albumin might have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant properties, the evidence of albumin for fluid resuscitation is still inconclusive [1R] . A multicenter, randomized, parallel, open-label, pragmatic trial evaluated the efficacy of long-term human albumin administration in decompensated cirrhosis. A total of 431 patients included in the study received standard treatment (combination of aldosteronic drugs and furosemide) or standard treatment plus longterm human albumin for up to 18 months. Overall, 18-month survival rate was higher in the standard treatment plus long-term albumin than standard treatment alone group (77% vs 66%; P \u00bc 0.028), and there were no difference in non-liver related adverse events [2C] .",

Overall, 135 patients developed cardiovascular disease (92 heart failure and 43 coronary artery disease) during the 10-year followup period [77C]. Facilities that collect and manufacture blood are under strict guidance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure there is uniform preparation of blood, sterility, and reduced risk of blood contamination with infectious diseases. In the United States, donated blood is tested for a myriad of infectious pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and Zika. Since the inception of testing for diseases transmitted through blood transfusions, the rate of infections has declined tremendously over the years in developed countries. Due to storage at room temperature, platelets possess the highest risk of bacterial contamination, limiting its storage to up to 5 days in most instances. The risk of a unit of platelets to be contaminated is 1 in 6000, while the risk of septic transfusion reaction is 1 in 100 000 but the reaction can be severe and fatal. There have been advances over the years to reduce pathogen transmission. Due to the screening efforts and pathogen reduction products, the rates of viral pathogen transmission remain quite low with a rate of 1 in 1-2 million; however, bacteria still remains a problem. There are continued efforts to improve blood safety with the use of pathogen reduction systems and new laboratory tests [78r].",

Based on previous literature, the current strategy in the United States appears costly with an unclear gain. There have been questions surrounding the appropriateness of screening and the possibility of reversing this requirement. Even though ZIKV has not been eliminated, the epidemic has waned substantially. The number of reported locally acquired cases in the continental United States has decreased from 226 in 2016 to a mere 2 in 2017.

Infection risk with platelet transfusion had been a concern for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and hemato-oncology conditions. In the United Kingdom, implementation of bacterial screening significantly reduced the risk of transfusion related infections; however, there is still a risk for complications such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis E, human T-lymphotropic virus, and cytomegalovirus [13R]. Previous evidence suggested that platelets stored at room temperature might increase bacterial proliferation, which leads to transfusion-related infection. A recent clinical trial of temperature cycling during platelet cold storage showed improvement in vivo recovery and survival in healthy volunteers. Temperature cycling platelets had in vivo recovery of 42.6% AE 16.4%, survival of 48.1% AE 14.4% hours, and area under curve (AUC) of 1331.3 AE 910.2 while the room temperature platelets in vivo recovery were 55.7% AE 13.9%, survival of 161.3 AE 28.8 h, and AUC of 5031.2 AE 1643.3 (n \u00bc 12, P < 0.05). In a separate paired comparison, cold temperature stored platelets had recovery of 23.1 AE 8.8%, survival of 33.7 AE 14.7 h, and AUC of 540.2 AE 229.6 while temperature cycling platelets had recovery of 36.5 AE 12.9%, survival of 49.0 AE 17.3 h, and AUC of 1164.3 AE 622.2 (n \u00bc 4, P < 0.05).
