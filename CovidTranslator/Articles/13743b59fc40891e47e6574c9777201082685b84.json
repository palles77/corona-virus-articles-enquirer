            "text": "Many eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses transcribe subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that are virus-derived messages that template the translation of a subset of viral proteins. Currently, the premature termination (PT) mechanism of sg mRNA transcription, a process thought to operate in a variety of viruses, is best understood in tombusviruses. The viral RNA elements involved in regulating this mechanism have been well characterized in several systems; however, no corresponding protein factors have been identified yet. Here we show that tombusvirus genome replication can be effectively uncoupled from sg mRNA transcription in vivo by C-terminal modifications in its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Systematic analysis of the PT transcriptional pathway using viral genomes harboring mutant RdRps revealed that the C-terminus functions primarily at an early step in this mechanism by mediating both efficient and accurate production of minus-strand templates for sg mRNA transcription. Our results also suggest a simple evolutionary scheme by which the virus could gain or enhance its transcriptional activity, and define global folding of the viral RNA genome as a previously unappreciated determinant of RdRp evolution.",

To date, three distinct mechanistic models for sg mRNA transcription have been identified. The internal initiation (II) model involves initiation of transcription at a sg mRNA promoter located internally within the full-length minus-strand of a viral genome (Miller et al, 1985) , whereas the discontinuous template synthesis (DTS) model entails the use of a discontinuously synthesized minus-strand template for sg mRNA transcription (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998; van Marle et al, 1999a; Pasternak et al, 2001; Sola et al, 2005) . In the premature termination (PT) model, the RdRp terminates prematurely while synthesizing a full-length minus-strand copy of the viral RNA genome and the 3 0 -truncated minus-strand RNA generated serves as a template for sg mRNA transcription (Sit et al, 1998; White, 2002) . This PT mechanism is believed to be utilized by a variety of viruses, including those that infect mammals (e.g., toroviruses; van Vliet et al, 2002; Smits et al, 2005) , aquatic invertebrates (e.g., roniviruses; Cowley et al, 2002) , fish (e.g., betanodaviruses; Iwamoto et al, 2005) , plants (e.g., dianthoviruses; Sit et al, 1998 and closteroviruses; Gowda et al, 2001) , and insects (e.g., nodaviruses; Lindenbach et al, 2002) .",

            "text": "Studies of TBSV have identified numerous RNA elements in the viral genome that are involved in the PT mechanism, including distant RNA-RNA interactions (Zhang et al, 1999; Choi et al, 2001; Choi and White, 2002; Lin and White, 2004) . Long-range interactions occur in the positive strand and involve RNA sequences located immediately 5 0 to the transcriptional initiation sites for sg mRNA1 and sg mRNA2, termed receptor sequence-1 (RS1) and RS2, respectively ( Figure 1B ). These two RS elements base pair with corresponding activator sequence-1 (AS1) and AS2, located B1000 and B2100 nt upstream, respectively ( Figure 1B) . The RNA structures formed by the AS/RS interactions are essential for the RdRp termination events that occur during minus-strand synthesis, and lead to production of 3 0 -truncated templates (Choi and White, 2002; Lin and White, 2004) . Interestingly, the long-range nature of these interactions is not essential, because an AS/RS element can be functionally replaced by a stable RNA hairpin positioned just upstream from its cognate transcription initiation site (Lin and White, 2004) . Termination efficiency at these RNA structures is also influenced by the distance between the base paired element and the site of initiation (i.e., the length of the so-called spacer element) ( Figure 1B ; Lin et al, 2007) . Subsequent utilization of 3 0 -truncated minus-strand templates for transcription relies on linear sg mRNA promoters located at their 3 0 -ends ( Figure 1B ). These promoters are structurally and functionally similar to that used by the virus to produce full-length positive-strand genomes (Lin and White, 2004) . Thus, mechanistically, the main feature distinguishing TBSV sg mRNA transcription from genome replication is the manner by which the corresponding minus-strand templates are generated (i.e., termination internally versus termination at the 5 0 end of the template).",

For TBSV, previous mutational analysis of the RS1 element suggested a possible role for this sequence in modulating sg mRNA2 levels in vivo (Choi and White, 2002) . However, because the RS1 sequence also encodes the C-terminus of the p92 RdRp ( Figures 1A and 2A) , it was unclear whether the defect was RNA-or protein-based. In this study, we systematically investigated the function of the C-terminus of the TBSV RdRp and demonstrate that viral genome replication can be efficiently uncoupled from sg mRNA transcription at the protein level. Our analyses also revealed the steps in the PT mechanism requiring the C-terminal activity and alluded to a plausible evolutionary scheme by which the virus could gain or enhance its transcriptional activity. Moreover, an important role for global RNA virus genome structure in modulating RdRp evolution was uncovered. Specific and general implications of these findings are discussed.",

Replicon-derived sg RNAs (sg Reps) were generated from HL65 and HL128 (containing the more stable RNA hairpins) when they were cotransfected with AS1m1, which provided wt RdRp in trans ( Figure 3C ).

The higher proportion of aberrant 3 0 -termini generated by the C-terminally truncated Cd4 would act to decrease overall promoter activity and contribute to the reduced levels of sg mRNA. Primer extension analysis of the 5 0 ends of sg mRNA2s from infections with Cd4 (and other C-terminally truncated mutants) revealed only authentic 5 0 termini, indicating no defects in terms of the accuracy of initiation of transcription (data not shown).",

Accordingly, these two components were examined with respect to the RdRp C-terminus. First, the transcriptional efficiency mediated by different sized RNA hairpins was assessed to determine how the C-terminal RdRp mutants would respond to structures with increasing thermodynamic stability ( Figure 5A ). This analysis was carried out using viral genomes that expressed an RdRp truncated by four residues (i.e., Cd4 based). Consistent with our other results ( Figure 3A and C), the genomes expressing the mutant RdRp (Cd4-2AS-H1 through -H4) did not utilize the RNA hairpin signals as efficiently as their counterparts expressing the wt RdRp (2AS-H1 through -H4; Figure 5B ). This relationship, depicted graphically in Figure 5C , indicates a general lower sensitivity of the mutant RdRp for detecting the base paired component of the RNA attenuation signal, particularly for H1 through H3 (note difference in slopes). In contrast, the corresponding relative accumulation profiles were comparable when spacer elements ranging in lengths from 0 to 6 nt were tested ( Figure 6 ). Thus, a mutant RdRp lacking four C-terminal residues has spacer length requirements that are similar to those of the wt RdRp.",

In TBSV, sg mRNA promoters and the genome plus-strand promoter have similar linear structures and sequence identities ( Figure 7A ) and are interchangeable (Lin and White, 2004) . Thus, to address the potential effects of the C-terminal truncations on sg mRNA promoter activity in a context independent of the sg mRNA-specific transcription attenuation components, we repositioned the sg mRNA2 promoter to the end of a small viral replicon (Rep-HL47) and compared the level of replication with that of a wt replicon containing the genomic promoter ( Figure 7A ). The mutant RdRps were provided in trans-through cotransfection with mutant viral genomes Cd1 through Cd5-and effects of the C-terminal deletions on the activities of the two promoters were monitored via replicon accumulation. Results from these cotransfection studies revealed that with increasing C-terminal deletions, accumulation levels of Rep-HL47 were more negatively affected than those of the wt replicon ( Figure 7B ). This general trend for the defects suggests that the C-terminal truncations preferentially affect the ability of the mutant RdRps to utilize the wt sg mRNA2 promoter ( Figure 7C ). Thus, even if these mutant RdRps were to generate wt promoters (i.e., minus-strand templates with 3 0 termini corresponding to the transcription initiation site), they would be slightly compromised (B10 to B35%) in their ability to utilize them.

            "text": "An interesting aspect of the TBSV RdRp is that the RNA sequence encoding its transcription-specific C-terminus is also an RNA regulatory element involved in directing sg mRNA1 transcription (Choi and White, 2002) . In particular, the RS1 element shares its sequence with the codons that specify the last three residues of the RdRp (refer to Figure 2A ). This is a fascinating example of precisely overlapping sub-elements where both components mediate the same viral process, that is, sg mRNA transcription. This tight coupling must, in turn, place unique evolutionary constraints on these elements. Despite such limitations, it is interesting to note that two tombusviruses, Cucumber Bulgarian virus (CBV) and Maize necrotic streak virus (MNeSV), contain modifications in this region that maintain both RNA-and protein-based functions. In these two viral genomes, the predicted AS1/RS1 interactions contain a GC base pair (which maintains the AS1/RS1 interaction) in place of the corresponding AU base pair in TBSV (compare structures of A/R-5GC and T100, respectively, in Figure 8A ). In CBV and MNeSV, the nucleotide substitutions in their AS1 and RS1 elements result in the maintenance of Leu residues internally and Val-to-Ala substitutions at the C-termini of their RdRps, respectively. To assess the effects of these modifications in the context of TBSV, we constructed a mutant genome that contained the double substitution of the AU-to-GC base pair, as well as the single substitution mutants A-to-G (at AS1) or U-to-C (at RS1; Figure 8A ). As anticipated, sg mRNA1 levels were preferentially affected, showing relative accumulation levels of B92% (for the UG wobble pair; mutant AS-5G), B10% (for the AC mismatch; RS-5C) and B113% (for the compensatory GC pair; A/R-5GC), as compared with that for the wt T100 ( Figure 8B ). Thus, although coding and RNA-based regulatory activities are tightly coupled in a common sequence, the AS1 and RS1 elements possess the capacity to evolve while maintaining both of these functions. Further relevance of this finding to RdRp evolution is presented in the following section.",

However, this uncoupling was not reproducible in vivo, because the same mutations proved to be lethal to the virus (Li and Stollar, 2004) .

The uncoupling of sg mRNA transcription in vivo has also been achieved in an arterivirus, Equine arteritis virus, where mutation of two different proteins that contain zinc-binding domains, nsp1 and nsp10 (neither is the RdRp), caused specific defects in the DTS mechanism of sg mRNA transcription (van Marle et al, 1999a, b; Tijms et al, 2001) .

Accordingly, the important C-terminal residues must either allow the RdRp to communicate directly with the RNA structures or mediate an indirect interaction via an auxiliary factor(s). Active tombusvirus replicase complexes purified from transfected yeast cells contain at least four different host proteins (in addition to p33 and p92) (Serva and Nagy, 2006) and can direct complementary strand synthesis in vitro when incubated with exogenous viral RNA templates (Serva and Nagy, 2006) . However, this extract, as well as similar replicase extracts from plants, is thus far unable to recognize the RNA attenuation signals for sg mRNA transcription in vitro (PD Nagy, personal communication). Therefore, either the extracts are missing a key factor(s) or the isolated complexes are perturbed in a way that inhibits this process. If the RdRp interacts directly with the attenuation signal, the C-terminal residues could function to organize the RdRp into a conformation that induces it to pause when it encounters the attenuation signal-thus providing an opportunity for termination.",

Conversely, the mutant RdRp showed altered positions of minus-strand termination as well as enhanced incorporation of non-templated residues ( Figure 4B ). The latter activity is a known property of viral RdRps (Nagy and Simon, 1997) and, for TBSV, C-terminal modifications appear to enhance this feature. For the wt RdRp, B60% of its minus-strand 3 0 -ends corresponded to the initiating nucleotide. In contrast, only B30% of the 3 0 -ends generated by the mutant RdRp mapped to this position ( Figure 4B ). Since aberrant 3 0 -termini negatively affect promoter utilization in TBSV, the higher proportion of 3 0 -extensions generated by the mutant RdRp could largely account for the proportionally greater reduction in sg mRNA accumulation-versus corresponding minus-strands ( Figure 9Bii ). In some cases, this imbalance may also be related to reduced ability of certain C-terminally truncated RdRps (e.g., Cd4) to utilize the sg mRNA promoter ( Figure  9Biii) . Thus, the combined effect of several distinct defects likely account for the overall reductions in sg mRNA accumulation levels ( Figure 9B) .",

How then was sg mRNA transcription introduced into a viral replication system? The necessity of the C-terminus for transcription, but not for replication, suggests a potential pathway for gaining (or enhancing) sg mRNA transcription through the C-terminal extension of a more primitive tombusvirus RdRp. Although other possibilities exist, this type of read-through genetic mechanism has been implicated in the evolution of cellular proteins derived from humans (Fiddes and Goodman, 1980) , Drosophila (Levine et al, 2006) and yeast (Namy et al, 2003) .",

In using a common type of plus-strand promoter for both processes, the RdRp adaptation necessary to gain the ability to transcribe sg mRNAs would be reduced. In this regard, the biogenesis of the PT system represents a simple but ingenious mechanism for relocating dormant internally positioned sg mRNA promoters to the 3 0 termini of minus-strand templateswhere they become highly active.",

This convoluted interdependence suggests that AS1, via its basepairing requirement with RS1, could influence the coding of the RdRp C-terminus-and thus the structure and function of this protein. The coexistence and coevolution of localized functional RNA elements and their corresponding coding sequences in mRNAs has been explored previously both in silico (Konecny et al, 2000; Pedersen et al, 2004) and in natural populations (Parmley et al, 2007) .

Considering that 10 out of 14 sequenced tombusviruses contain the AU base pair, it is reasonable to believe that the GC variant arose from the former 'consensus' base pair. This concept is also supported by the observation that the introduction of the GC base pair into a TBSV context induced slightly improved levels of sg mRNA1 accumulation (i.e., B113%; Figure 8 ), which would presumably confer enhanced fitness by providing more coat protein for virus assembly. In terms of the order of appearance of the individual substitutions, the presence of GU wobble base pairs in two tombusviruses (Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV) and TBSV-statice isolate (TBSV-S); refer to Figure 8A ) suggests that the A-to-G substitution at the distal AS1 occurred first, followed by a compensating U-to-C at RS1 ( Figure 10B ). This order is also supported experimentally in TBSV, where the GU base pair-containing intermediate was found to be somewhat compromised (B92%), but considerably more transcriptionally active than the AC mismatchcontaining intermediate (B10%) (Figure 8 ). The greater functionality of the GU wobble base pair would aid it competitively and allow it to persist long enough-as suggested by its existence in natural tombusvirus populations of CNV and TBSV-S-for the compensatory change to occur (Rousset et al, 1991) . Therefore, following this line of reasoning, the substitution at the distal AS1 element would initiate the cascade of events that lead to the modification of the C-terminus of the RdRp encoded B1000 nt downstream ( Figure 10B ). Moreover, as mfold analysis predicts formation of the AS1/RS1 interaction in the context of a folded full-length TBSV RNA genome (Choi and White, 2002) , these data suggest a previously unappreciated role for the global structure of an RNA virus genome in modulating viral protein evolution. The implications of this finding are also relevant to understanding evolutionary processes in other viruses such as Hepatitis C virus (Kim et al, 2003) , Dengue virus (Alvarez et al, 2005) , Flock house virus (Lindenbach et al, 2002) and Barley yellow dwarf virus (Miller and White, 2006) , all of which contain functional long-distance RNA-RNA interactions involving coding regions. Furthermore, as there is computational (Meyer and Miklos, 2005) and experimental (Nackley et al, 2006) evidence for functional higher-order RNA structures in coding regions of cellular mRNAs, the relevance of this concept will likely extend beyond viral messages.",

Based on the above constructs, additional modifications were introduced and the relevant differences are presented in the accompanying figures. All modifications were made using PCRbased mutagenesis and standard cloning techniques (Sambrook The 5 0 portion of the TBSV genome is shown schematically. The genome at the top encodes a primitive RdRp lacking notable transcriptional activity, whereas that below contains a C-terminally extended p92 ORF (hatched box) that confers enhanced transcriptional activity.

The genome at the top has gained an A-to-G nucleotide substitution in AS1, whereas that below contains a second compensating mutation in RS1. Nucleotide substitutions are indicated along with effects on the corresponding amino-acid sequences (in parentheses). See text for details. et al, 1989) . The PCR-derived regions introduced into the constructs were sequenced completely to ensure that only the intended modifications were present.",
