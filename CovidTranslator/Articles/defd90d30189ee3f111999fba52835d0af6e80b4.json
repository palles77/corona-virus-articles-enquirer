As the \"front door\" to the hospital for a significant number of patients, the sheer variety of possible clinical presentations that present in an unexpected manner is truly daunting. From an acute care standpoint, these presentations vary from the common (eg, asthma, seizures), to the rare (eg, penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma, organophosphate poisoning), to the novel and unexpected (eg, newly emerging infectious disease such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or Ebola), with uncommon or unusual presentations of everything in between. Further layered on that clinical complexity is a broad range of care providers that must function as a coordinated team. These team members range from various students, to the unit aides/clerks, residents, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, paramedics, respiratory therapists, and attending physicians whom together make up the backbone of the PEM environment.

As such, PEM has been among the leaders in the integration of this modality for clinical training. Traditionally, simulation has been used extensively for the dissemination of clinical training in the areas of clinical knowledge and its application, and the clinical, technical, and teamwork skills involved in PEM care. Increasingly, simulation is being used in novel applications, including breaking bad news, disclosure of error, family-centered care, quality and patient safety education, and system-level integration. The future will look to further identify, measure, and inform the integration of simulation with new and innovative adjuncts in the clinical environment, as well as to determine the optimal timing and use of simulation-based education to enhance the quality of care delivered to patients by the interprofessional and multidisciplinary team.",

And finally, this system relies on the interplay of communication between team members, between the team and the \"system\" and between the team and the patients and families that we serve. Whether this communication is the handover of a patient or breaking bad news to a family, each situation is dynamic, uncertain, and potentially loaded with safety issues at each step. It is in all of these diverse ways that the experiential learning model at the foundation of simulation-based education (SBE) matches the PEM environment and thus has led to the relatively quick uptake over the past 2 decades. This article will tackle 3 essential elements of the relationship between simulation and PEM. First is a review of \"where we have been,\" including the breadth of curriculum and integration that has been created and disseminated from the inception of simulation in the PEM environment to the present. Next is a review of \"where we are now,\" in particular highlighting areas where PEM simulation is being creative, innovative, and setting a new bar for those who deliver SBE in any area. The final component is a compelling review of \"where we are going,\" a provocative view of where simulation may be further expanding new boundaries in the delivery of PEM-based SBE and clinical care.",

            "text": "Life-threatening events and cardiopulmonary arrests in pediatrics are rare. Therefore, the knowledge, clinical, procedural, and team skills necessary to efficiently and effectively run a pediatric resuscitation are not frequently practiced, making simulation the ideal environment to further hone these skills in order to be prepared for the real event. [4] [5] [6] The American Heart Association has advocated for the increased use of simulation as part of advanced life support training, including Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS). The addition of simulation to advanced life support curriculum has been shown to increase knowledge and skills in providers relative to those who did not receive simulation as part of their training. 7, 8 Furthermore, high-fidelity resuscitation training has been shown to improve acquisition of clinical skills in comparison to training with low-fidelity manikins, thus supporting the American Heart Association's integration of simulation into these curriculum. 9 A longitudinally distributed PALS course with a significant simulation component has also been developed to address the issue of knowledge decay seen in students following PALS courses. 10, 11 Trauma Pediatric trauma care was one of the earliest areas of focus within PEM regarding simulation-based training. [12] [13] [14] Because these patients are some of the more complex within the PEM environment, from both a clinical and team dynamics standpoint, simulation training is a natural fit for pediatric trauma and has been shown to improve the quality of care provided in different studies. 15, 16 Simulation has been used to identify significant gaps in knowledge, equipment, team skills, and systems related to the assessment and management of trauma patients in the rural environment, 17 although many of the areas identified as deficiencies would be relevant to trauma care in an urban PEM environment. Based on this need, established programs like the American College of Surgeons' Advanced Trauma Life Support Course 18 have increasingly used simulation as a means to practice the various clinical and procedural skills. More recently, courses like Trauma Resuscitation In Kids, 19 developed by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, have heavily leveraged the use of simulation in terms of the practical application of the concepts taught within the course. Trauma Resuscitation In Kids has also tried to maximize the use of interprofessional teams and a focus on team training in further driving the realism and pertinence of this experiential learning.",

The specific etiology of the MCI dictates the types and numbers of patients to be expected. There are several cognitive, emotional, and physical vulnerabilities that make the pediatric application of MCI training unique, including plans for patient reunification with family members. 20, 21 Depending on the magnitude of the event, the goal of the PEM team changes to doing the most good for the most patients, within the limitation of available resources. 22, 23 Because this affects the initial triage, stabilization and disposition of patients, simulated disaster codes can be an excellent way of practicing these specialized skills.

The physical transport of patients most often occurs in an environment that is not ideal for the provision of pediatric emergency and critical care (eg, helicopter, ambulance, fixed-wing aircraft), but necessary based on the long distance required for the provision of definitive care. All of the elements of this dynamic environment can be simulated: tight spaces, noise, vibration, specialized equipment, and extreme conditions that impact the rapid evaluation and management of patients being transported.

Other boot camps have been developed to help with the transition between years in training (ie, from year 1 to year 2 of PEM fellowship training). Some programs have even used this learning modality to link up with other programs and maximize time, space, equipment, and human resources (ie, facilitators). A combination of procedural skills, clinical skills, and team training (crisis resource management) are often covered. Their popularity stems in part due the practicality of scheduling; some programs can cover new fellows or interns for a day or two of dedicated training vs routine longitudinal attendance at a weekly simulation event.

The primary objective of JIT is to choose the patient or procedure ahead of time and to rehearse performance prior to managing the patient or performing the procedure in real life. Although the prediction of clinical presentations to the ED is impossible, certain thematic topics can be predicted in a JIT fashion: assessment of a polytrauma patient, approach to a poisoned patient, mass-casualty incident, cardiac arrest, and so on. This is an obvious difference with JIT sessions traditionally seen in intensive care units and inpatient units, where a specific patient is chosen based on the potential for deterioration. As opposed to scenario-based clinical presentations for knowledge and team training, JIT in the ED is well suited to procedural skill training. There have been several successful examples of this published in the literature related to lumber puncture, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (chest compressions), and airway management. 34, 35 WHERE WE ARE NOW Initially, simulation in PEM consisted of training in high-stakes, time-sensitive events, such as resuscitations and procedures, that were difficult to train exclusively in real-life scenarios due to the infrequent nature and the life or death consequences associated with management of these events. As discussed above, these skills remain the predominant focus of simulation training in fellowship programs. However, current applications have expanded to include nontechnical skills such as communication and management of psychosocial issues. 36 This has occurred in part in response to changes in the health care environment that have placed an increased emphasis on providing high quality, safe, and family-centered care. 37, 38 In addition, there has been increased appreciation of the essential role communication plays in patient outcomes and satisfaction.",

This distress is further compounded by the uncertainty of how the family will respond given that PEM providers usually do not have long-term relationships with patients and families. Appropriate preparation and education can make difficult conversations less stressful for the PEM physician, and in cases of death notification, it may help decrease the development of pathologic grief in the surviving family members that can occur when death is unexpected.

While some centers can either simulate or provide this feature, this ability currently comes with both a time and monetary cost to maintain. The absence of EMR interaction creates the potential for negative learning as team leaders/ members may forget, for example, to close the loop regarding order placement when the EMR is omitted. Further, EMRs can be part of important system barriers that may go unrecognized without their inclusion during simulation. Our local experience with ordering emergent blood products has illustrated how challenging this can be and forms an important take home for learners (ie, to learn how to order blood before the crisis). Further work needs to identify methods to allow use of existing EMR systems in simulation. At the same time, hospitals should be encouraged to invest in workable test systems that can be used for more than the mundane technical testing needs.

It is clear that these events are time, resource and staff intensive events that must be designed in a way to produce meaningful training and/or system level data. While these events exist today, the future challenge is to translate the \"occasional\" event at a few sites to the \"regular\" event at most/all institutions.",

The approach also aligns well with the EPA model described aboveif we directly train learners until they can do a task reliably then we can more easily answer the question to what extent we trust them (in the EPA sense). The question facing the PEM educational community is which tasks and skills will be addressed with this approach given finite resources and the inherent additional remediation required for a portion of learners in a mastery learning model. Lumbar puncture, airway and CPR/ resuscitation skills 56 are clear targets, with teamwork and communication skills an evolving target area. The challenge will be how to use this dataare there resources to continue remediation as needed for all learners? How do we manage the 'stragglers'? PEM simulation educators should be aware of this approach as it becomes more mainstream and impacts the demand on available resources.",

There is a clear role for the PEM simulation programs to extend their SBE offerings to these sites, with the approach tailored for local needs. For programs in which there are on-site faculty available, one marker of success is the training, to the extent possible, of simulation champions or leaders who can take on part or all of the responsibility of providing simulation at the community site. It is less of a challenge overall to get simulation equipment to the community site, as compared to providing qualified simulation educators. Future opportunities include linked simulation that starts at the community site, and is then handed off to a \"transport team\" and transported to the referral hospital. This approach provides a method to practice remote communication and transport medical control within an integrated simulation. It is also a venue in which the community and regional providers can develop a common understanding of the often very different practice constraints and conditions between the 2 sites and possible identify opportunities for common practice (eg, sepsis management). As noted above, remote tele-education is also an opportunity for simulation delivery if the technical equipment and expertise are developed.",

However, important safety events often occur around slower declines in patient status and the success or failure of the team in recognizing and acting on patient deterioration. Scenarios involving an evolving case of sepsis or a decline in mental status are typical case targets for the topic. The general simulation approach has been to use \"time skips\" to forward the case to another key transition (ie, \"it is now 2-hours later\"). This expediency precludes the team's chance to identify their own patterns or trends, which may be the key learning tasks for certain clinical presentations. Future work on how one feasibly implements long-form simulation would target a key patient safety and teamwork domain not currently well addressed.",

The possibility of exploring new ideas at the interface of technology and clinical care, larger and longer system-based educational events over a more distributed and interconnected system, new ways of exploring the patient and family experience and safer care, and innovative models of delivering simulation to the end user (learner), will all keep the PEM environment at the cutting edge of SBE.",
