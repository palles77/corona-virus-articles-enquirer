            "text": "N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification heavily impacting protein functions. Some alterations of glycosylation, such as sialic acid hydrolysis, are related to protein dysfunction. Because of their high flexibility and the many reactive groups of the glycan chains, studying glycans with in vitro methods is a challenging task. Molecular dynamics is a useful tool and probably the only one in biology able to overcome this problem and gives access to conformational information through exhaustive sampling. To better decipher the impact of Nglycans, the analysis and visualization of their influence over time on protein structure is a prerequisite. We developed the Umbrella Visualization, a graphical method that assigns the glycan intrinsic flexibility during a molecular dynamics trajectory. The density plot generated by this method brought relevant informations regarding glycans dynamics and flexibility, but needs further development in order to integrate an accurate description of the protein topology and its interactions. We propose here to transform this analysis method into a visualization mode in UnityMol. UnityMol is a molecular editor, viewer and prototyping platform, coded in C#. The new representation of glycan chains presented in this study takes into account both the main positions adopted by each antenna of a glycan and their statistical relevance. By displaying the collected data on the protein surface, one is then able to investigate the protein/glycan interactions. Thr and Asn-X-Ser, where X is any amino acid but not proline [10] . In",

            "text": "The ECM is a very dynamical environment with ongoing remodelling or degradation, making it a source of many active molecules. Enzymes or matrix degradation products, i.e. matrikines [4] , are able to interact with the nearby cells through receptors, mostly transmembrane proteins which are located at the cell surface [5] [6] [7] [8] . These proteins trigger molecular signals through the membrane, allowing cells to react to their environment. Understanding how these signaling processes take place and how cells are affected is essential in order to deepen our understanding of the biochemical role of the ECM. As an example, the insulin receptor (IR) is a protein belonging to the class II tyrosine kinase receptors family. IR is synthesized as a precursor of 210 kDa. The proprotein is cleaved into an and a subunits linked by a disulfide bridge. The subunit is extracellular while the subunit contains an extracellular part about 190 amino acids, a transmembrane helix and a cytoplasmic domain. The mature receptor is present at the membrane as a dimer with 2 and subunits. Transmembrane proteins, as well as proteins composing the ECM, are modified after their synthesis by posttranslational processes. Glycosylation is an enzymatic maturation process essential to the protein function, including ligand-receptor affinity and dimerisation [9] . This process involves the attachment of branched chains of saccharide residues on the protein surface. More precisely, Nglycosylations are defined by the covalent linking of a glycan chain to the amide nitrogen of asparagine predominantly at the sequons Asn-X-the IR, 18 potential N-glycosylation sites are identified (14 in subunit and 4 in subunit). These chains are constituted of several types of saccharide residues connected by a linear glycosydic linkage and arranged around a common, rigid core with highly variable and flexible branches. N-glycans are classified into 3 types: high-mannose, complex and hybrid types. High-mannose types are glycans only elongated with mannose residues beyond the core structure. Complex types are extended with other monosaccharides. Hybrid glycans are bi/tri-antennary glycans with one high-mannose branch and one or two complex branches. Because these chains are bulky, they play an important role in protein folding, helping it to adopt its fully functional 3D structure. Glycosylations are sometimes bound by proteins, such as lectins [11] , and act as recognition patterns in signaling pathways. Alterations of the glycosylation pattern are observed in pathological contexts and affect the protein functions in diseases such as cancers, diabetes or cardiovascular diseases [12] .",

It also provides a plug-in reading MD trajectories. The Unity engine makes it easy to work either with built-in tools or to implement new features. The wide use of this platform also warrants support from an active community and provides online resources and tutorials. This engine supports different platforms such as Android, Windows, Linux or Mac platforms. Exporting the executable file for these platforms is done at compilation, and saves a great amount of time by avoiding further developments. The Unity graphical interface also displays a Game Mode that allows a user to run its program without compiling it. This feature is especially useful in order to rapidly and easily test adjustments brought to the code. Unity is also known for being relatively user-friendly, partially thanks to its interface, but it is also important to note that every parameters and components are accessible via scripting in C# or Javascript languages, making it a very versatile tool.

The higher the count, the darker the pixel will be, highlighting the parts of the protein that are most often obscured by the glycan (Fig. 2E) . Pixels color are defined by three components: r, g and b. These components determine the final color of the pixel by adjusting the red, green and blue hues (r, g and b).

These residues would be able to interact with the many hydroxyl groups of the sugar residues, hence stabilizing the position of the glycan above this region. Knowing how basic residues can be key amino acids in protein/protein interactions [45] , it would be interesting to investigate the role of the residues composing this patch. We can imagine that these basic residues play a role in stabilizing the glycan in order to allow other proteins such as the neuraminisade I to interact with it. By correlating these results with the docking experiment previously ran, we bring new informations regarding the interaction with the neuraminidase I and the glycosylated insulin receptor.",

By applying the Umbrella Visualization on an insulin receptor bearing fully sialylated glycans, we hope to point out important interactions involved in this mechanism. Because sialic acids are negatively charged, they have the potential to interact strongly with positively charged residues. It would be interesting to see if the basic patch we highlighted in our results has any influence on sialylated glycans.",

Because some proteins are heavily glycosylated, we will optimize this to enable the visualization and analysis of multi-glycosylated proteins, meaning that their molecular weight is increased. This process heavily relies on the use of a prefab, so it is possible to instantiate one object several times in the same UnityMol session while applying transformations to components of single instances of the prefab. Each instance of the plane assigned to a glycan can thus be oriented accordingly. The Umbrella Visualization method could help investigate how glycans modulate protein-protein interfaces in biological contexts. For example, it has been shown that the human coronavirus NL63, a virus causing severe lower-respiratory-tract infections, uses a glycan shield to protect surface epitopes from the host immune system [46] . The role and impact of this shield could be unraveled with the Umbrella Visualization.",

The Umbrella Representation considers the glycan acting as an umbrella over the protein surface. B) Implementation of the Umbrella Visualization process: The glycan is represented in sticks. The core of the Glycan, shown in green, is aligned along the z axis thanks to vectors describing the core (red arrows). The center of mass (red dots) of the last saccharide residue on the branches is projected on the xy plane. The final result is a density plot reflecting the relative flexibility of the glycan during a MD trajectory.

The global shape for the bi-antennary glycans is more stretched along the protein. Triantennary glycans display a wider shadow. This is consistent with the fact that this glycan has one extra branch able to explore a wider space. B) Patch of basic residues located near the glycan (red arrows). The glycan's shadow tends to hover around this part of the surface. This could indicate the role of these amino acids in stabilizing the glycan. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Results of the Umbrella Visualization on three MD samples. The flat textures projected onto the surfaces are shown as insets. A) Results extracted from 250 frames. The overall tendency is already visible, highlighting the importance of the basic residues. B) Results extracted from 2500 frames. C) Results extracted from 10000 frames. By increasing the number of frames used for the computation, the lower area (bottom red arrow) becomes more compact and darker while a light spread zone (top red arrow) appears in the upper area. This clearly indicates that with a low amount of frames, the role of zones may be overestimated while others are missed. The dt label is the elapsed time for the calculation of these results.
