            "text": "Modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are commonly used to reduce the impact of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) but limited efficacy is achieved in field conditions. Here, we evaluated the impact of maternally-derived neutralizing antibodies (MDNAs) on vaccine efficacy after PRRS virus (PRRSV) challenge. Piglets with low (A\u00c0) or high (A+) MDNA levels derived from a commercial pig herd were moved to experimental facilities to be vaccinated (V+) or not (V\u00c0) with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine at 3 weeks of age (woa). Because of unexpectedly low vaccine detection in A\u00c0V+ piglets post-vaccination (pv), all V+ piglets received a second vaccination at 4 woa. Five weeks (W5) pv, piglets were inoculated with a PRRSV-1 field strain to evaluate vaccine protection, and were mingled 24 h later with noninoculated piglets of similar immune status to assess viral transmission. Vaccine strain was detected at W2 pv in 69% and 6% of A\u00c0V+ and A+V+ piglets, and at W5 pv in 50% and 25% of A\u00c0V+ and A+V+ piglets, respectively. At W5 pv, 94% of A\u00c0V+ and 44% of A+V+ piglets seroconverted, with a significant IFNg response induction in the A\u00c0V+ group only. After challenge, compared to the V\u00c0 inoculated group, viremia was 100-fold lower at 10 days post-infection in A\u00c0V+ whereas viremia was not significantly reduced in A+V+ piglets. A lower transmission rate was estimated for the A\u00c0V+ group: 0.15 [0.07-0.29] versus 0.44 [0.18-1.76] and 0.32 [0.14-0.68] for the A+V+ and V\u00c0 groups, respectively. Investigations about the low vaccine strain detection after the first vaccination suggested a relationship between IFNa levels and vaccine strain detection in A\u00c0V+ piglets. We showed that MDNAs impair vaccine efficacy against PRRSV both in inoculated and contact piglets, probably by reducing vaccine replication. IFNa may also interfere with PRRSV vaccination. These new data could help improving vaccination protocols.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), caused by a small RNA virus, member of the Arteriviridae family [1] , is one of the most costly diseases in swine production world-wide [2, 3] . In Western Europe, PRRS virus 1 (PRRSV-1) is the main circulating PRRSV species. PRRSV infection is characterized by reproductive failure in sows and by respiratory disorders, growth retardation and increased mortality in growing pigs. PRRSV predis-poses pigs to secondary infections associated with the porcine respiratory disease complex [4] . To limit the impact of PRRS, modified live virus (MLV) vaccines based on cell culture attenuated PRRSV strains are routinely used in gilts, sows and growing pigs, but control of PRRS in the field is still a challenge. Only partial protection is achieved, mainly limiting the clinical signs and lesions [5] [6] [7] . However, in experimental conditions, these vaccines provide good protection against PRRSV challenge in piglets, controlling the viremia in infected pigs and decreasing transmission to contact pigs [8, 9] . Unlike to experimental conditions, in field conditions, vaccinated piglets are generally born to PRRSV infected, exposed or vaccinated sows since they are commonly vaccinated against PRRSV to prevent PRRSV circulation in farrowing units and improve farrowing https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.06.045 0264-410X/\u00d3 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. rates [10] . Consequently, high levels of maternally-derived antibodies (MDAs) against PRRSV are frequently detected in piglets vaccinated at weaning [11] . Among MDAs, maternally-derived neutralizing antibodies (MDNAs) can protect suckling piglets against PRRSV infection during their first weeks of life and prevent viremia in weaned piglets [12, 13] . However, we recently demonstrated a negative impact of MDNAs on PRRSV vaccination in piglets vaccinated at 3 weeks of age (woa) with a PRRSV-1 MLV vaccine [14] . In this study, vaccine strain replication was impaired and both PRRSV antibody and IFNg-secreting cell production were inhibited for 4 weeks post-vaccination (pv) in piglets with high levels of MDNAs. This interference of MDNAs with postvaccination immune response suggested weak protection against PRRSV infection of piglets vaccinated in presence of high MDNA levels that could explain the lower vaccine efficacy observed in the field. Previous studies reported that vaccination in piglets with high MDA levels had no impact on vaccine efficacy but neutralizing antibodies (NAs) were not considered [15] . In the present study, piglets were vaccinated in the presence of low or high MDNA levels and further challenged with a wild PRRSV-1 to assess the impact of MDNAs on the efficacy of PRRSV-1 MLV vaccination.",

Before starting the study, the absence of PRRSV circulation was individually checked by ELISA in pigs sampled at the end of the fattening period and by PCR in weaned piglets using sample pools of 5 animals. Piglets used in this study were born from 4 sows with high PRRSV NA titres and from 5 sows with low PRRSV NA titers. At 1 woa, blood was collected from piglets in order to assign them according to their PRRSV-specific MDNA level: A+ (high level, mean NA titre 201 \u00b1 73) and A\u00c0 (low level, mean NA titre 10 \u00b1 5). At 3 woa, study piglets were weaned, transferred to the Anses biosafety level 3 animal facilities in Ploufragan and randomly distributed according to A+/A\u00c0 status, weight and gender ( Fig. 1; 8 piglets per group). The absence of PRRSV infection in piglets at 3 woa was checked by RT-PCR using sample pools of 5 animals. The decay of MDA was then individually evaluated at 3 woa afterwards (A+: mean NA titer 10 \u00b1 5; A\u00c0: no-longer detectable NA). Piglets were vaccinated (V+) or not (V\u00c0) twice at 3 and 4 woa using one dose of Porcilis PRRS vaccine (MSD, Beaucouz\u00e9, France) by intramuscular injection in the neck using a syringe with a needle 0.6 * 25 mm (vaccine lot No. A208DB01). At 5 weeks postfirst vaccination (W5 pv), half of the piglets were inoculated with 5\u00c110 5 TCID 50 /pig of the PRRSV-1 Finistere strain (PRRS-FR-2005-29-24-1) by nasal inoculation using a syringe without needle (2.5 mL per nostril). The day after, non-inoculated contact (C) piglets of the same immune status were mingled with inoculated (I) piglets in the same pens (2 C and 2 I piglets by pen). Eight unvaccinated and non-inoculated piglets (4 A+ and 4 A\u00c0) were assigned to control groups. Due to the waning of MDNA, at the time of PRRSV inoculation the A+ piglets from the V\u00c0 and control groups had undetectable PRRS antibody levels (VNT and ELISA tests, data not shown). This identical immune status between A+ and A\u00c0 allowed us to mingle the results of the A+ and A\u00c0 piglets from V\u00c0 and control groups for the post-inoculation period.",

            "text": "In the present study, we observed a lower interference of MDNAs on post-vaccine immune responses compared to the previous one reported by Fablet [14] where a complete impairment was observed during 4 weeks pv. This reduced interference could be ascribed to the need to vaccinate the piglets twice and the ensuing decrease of MDNAs levels at the time of the second vaccination. At the time of first vaccination (3 woa), the decrease of MDNA level was already high but the mean NA titre in the present study (10 \u00b1 5) was comparable to the one in Fablet's study (20 \u00b1 15) . Despite the slightly reduced post-vaccine differences between A +V+ and A\u00c0V+ we observed in the present study, the postchallenge results demonstrated for the first time that the PRRSV vaccination was effective only in piglets with low levels of MDNAs. The low virulence of the PRRSV-1 strain used to challenge the animals limited the evaluation of the vaccine efficacy to virological parameters only. We previously demonstrated that the Porcilis PRRS vaccine can protect SPF piglets (no MDAs) from a challenge with the same low virulent strain, decreasing the viremia in inoculated piglets and considerably reducing the transmission of the Finistere strain to contact piglets [8] . In the present study, the challenge strain viral load was significantly reduced only in A\u00c0V+ inoculated and contact piglets compared to unvaccinated piglets. In a similar unpublished study, we also showed that PRRSV challenge strain viremia was significantly reduced for A\u00c0V+ inoculated piglets compared to A+V+ animals during the first 3 weeks pi ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . In this study, vaccine viremia was also only detected in 1 out of 12 A\u00c0V+ piglet at W2 post-vaccination but a second vaccination was not performed before challenge, indicating that the negative impact of MDNAs on PRRS vaccine efficacy also occurred in the absence of vaccine viremia and with usual single vaccination protocols implemented in the field.",

In Jeong's study, all the piglets were MDA+ at vaccination (no MDA-group included) and thus this precluded to clearly evaluating the impact of MDAs on the vaccine efficacy. As the same, Balasch et al. recently showed that vaccination of 1-day-old piglets using a new PRRSV-1 MLV in presence of MDAs induced a partial protection against a challenge at 67 days pv [18] . In Balasch's study, NAs were quantified in piglets at the vaccination time but here also the absence of comparison with vaccinated piglets without MDNAs limits the conclusions of the study.",

            "text": "In addition, considering the contact animals, our results also demonstrated that MDNAs decreased the PRRS vaccine efficacy on virus transmission. In the present study, PRRS vaccination in A\u00c0V+ piglets reduced the transmission rate of the Finistere strain two-fold compared to the rate estimated for the V-group. The magnitude of the effect is substantially lower than what was found in our previous study with a ten-fold reduced transmission rate in vaccinated SPF pigs, with non MDA [8] . One possible explanation for this discrepancy may be the intradermal route (ID) used for vaccination in our previous work. This immunization route was previously shown to induce an enhanced cell-mediated immune response after PRRSV exposure and a lower respiratory clinical score compared to IM vaccination [5] . The better immune response, especially at the mucosal sites, elicited after ID immunization, may have limited viral replication in the respiratory tract, thus reducing virus excretion and transmission. In Fablet et al. study [14] , vaccine viremia was detected in 60% of A\u00c0V+ piglets at W2 pv whereas only in 12.5% of A\u00c0V+ piglets of the present study after the first vaccination. To explore these unexpected results, we attempted to investigate the origin of this low vaccine replication displayed in A\u00c0V+ piglets after vaccination at 3 woa. The vaccine strain was titrated, but no problem was detected. As IFNa was recently shown to strongly inhibit the replication of a genotype 2 PRRS MLV [21] , we hypothesized this cytokine could be responsible for the inhibition of vaccine replication in our A\u00c0V+ piglets. Indeed, the levels of IFNa detected in piglets from the present study at 3 woa were much higher than those from our previous study [14] and in the same range as the concentration shown to be able to completely inhibit PRRS MLV replication [22] .",

In the absence of suitable samples (not of the right type or not collected at the right time) for further exploration, we were not able to identify the cause of these increased IFNa levels. However, this cytokine is known to be produced in response to many viral infections such as swine influenza [23] or porcine respiratory coronavirus [24, 25] that could infect piglets at weaning when they are frequently vaccinated against PRRSV. As a result, this potential viral interference with the PRRS MLV vaccine may be another possible explanation for the limited PRRS MLV vaccine efficacy observed in the field.",

Unexpectedly, we also showed that other factors such as IFNa may interfere with PRRS MLV vaccination. Further research is needed to explore a possible viral interference phenomenon toward PRRS MLV vaccines.
