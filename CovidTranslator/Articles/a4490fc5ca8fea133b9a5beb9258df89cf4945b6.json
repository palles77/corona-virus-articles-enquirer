The main limitation is primary and secondary resistance, the underlying mechanism of which requires extensive investigation. We proved that PRSS expression levels are significantly negatively associated with the sensitivity of cancer cells to cetuximab. Detailed mechanistic analysis indicated that PRSS can cleave cetuximab, leading to resistance. Cetuximab or bevacizumab combined with SPINK1, a PRSS inhibitor, inhibited cell growth more efficiently than cetuximab or bevacizumab alone in xenograft models. PRSS levels in the serum of 156 patients with mCRC were analyzed, and poor efficacy of cetuximab therapy was observed in patients with aberrant PRSS expression. PRSS expression in monoclonal antibody (mAb)-treated patients with cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas database was also evaluated to determine whether patients with higher PRSS expression have significantly reduced progression-free survival. Our work provides a strong scientific rationale for targeting PRSS in combination with cetuximab therapy.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major contributor to cancer mortality and morbidity in both developed and developing countries (1, 2) and is the world's fourth deadliest cancer (after lung, liver, and stomach cancer), accounting for almost 881,000 deaths in 2018 (3, 4) . Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog/human epidermal growth factor receptor (ERBB/ HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), is one of the most prominent therapeutic targets in metastatic CRC (mCRC). EGFR is commonly overexpressed on the cell membrane in several cancers, including lung, colon, head and neck, and esophageal cancer. Ligand binding causes homo-and heterodimerization between EGFR and other HER family members (ERBB2/HER2, ERBB4/HER4, and kinaseinactive ERBB3/HER3), resulting in downstream activation of the RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathways (5) and eventually accelerating cell growth and carcinogenesis. Accordingly, numerous targeted molecules have been developed to either block ligand binding or inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase activity.",

However, cetuximab therapy has had only a modest impact on mCRC, achieving only approximately 10% objective response rates when used as a monotherapy for chemorefractory mCRC.

            "text": "A rapidly accumulating body of evidence indicates that resistance to EGFR blockade in mCRC is parallel to or downstream of EGFR, mutations in RAS (exons 2 to 4) (12) , BRAF (exon 15) (13) , and PIK3CA (exon 20) (14, 15) , and amplification of the genes KRAS (16, 17) , HER2, and MET (18) . However, predicting responses to anti-EGFR mAbs in patients with mCRC remains challenging. Extensive research has determined that even in patients with tumors harboring wild-type KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA, interindividual variability in the response to cetuximab exists, and that in a large proportion of responsive patients, acquired resistance to cetuximab emerges despite the absence of detectable mutations in RAS (17) , BRAF (19) , and PIK3CA (14) . In clinical practice, identifying specific and easily assayed secreted biomarkers for anti-EGFR mAbs is of paramount importance for predicting and monitoring the therapeutic response and resistance. Although RAS and BRAF have been identified as predictive and prognostic biomarkers for patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR mAbs, due to unmet clinical needs, we hypothesized that additional biomarkers may also contribute to anti-EGFR antibody efficacy. We demonstrate the possibility of using PRSS (a serine protease) as a predictive marker of the mCRC response to cetuximab treatment. PRSS1 encodes the pancreatic serine proteinase, which is also named trypsin-1, a major pancreatic digestive enzyme that also catalyzes the activation of other pancreatic zymogens into active enzymes, which normally occurs in the intestine (20) . A heterozygous PRSS1 pathogenic variant was identified to confirm the diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis, inform treatment, and enable variant-specific testing of at-risk family members (20) . PRSS1 is expressed in a variety of cancer cell lines and tissues. Tumor-associated trypsinogens (21) are also strongly associated with the depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, an advanced pathological tumornode-metastasis stage, and recurrence in ovarian cancer (22) , esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (23) , and CRC (24) .",

Detailed mechanistic analysis indicated that PRSS can cleave cetuximab and other mAbs, including bevacizumab and trastuzumab, leading to antibody resistance. Cetuximab or bevacizumab combined with serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1), a PRSS inhibitor, inhibited cell growth more efficiently than cetuximab or bevacizumab alone in xenograft models. We also identified and preliminarily validated the significant association between the serum PRSS1 levels of patients with mCRC and the lack of response to cetuximab therapy. PRSS levels in the serum of 64 healthy individuals and 156 patients with mCRC were analyzed, and poor efficacy of antibody therapy was observed in patients with aberrant PRSS expression. Using systematically characterized clinical data from patients with mCRC, we subdivided the patients into two major subgroups according to the serum PRSS1 level and found significant differences in progressionfree survival (PFS). To validate our findings, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to examine whether the clinical outcomes of patients who received antibody monotherapy were associated with PRSS expression. Consistent with the results of our patients treated with cetuximab, we found that patients with low PRSS1 or PRSS3 expression had longer PFS than those with high PRSS1 or PRSS3 expression. Together, our findings indicate that PRSS plays an essential role in the development of cetuximab resistance in patients with mCRC and may be a candidate biomarker of the response to mAbs such as cetuximab, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab. In particular, we also presume that combining a PRSS inhibitor and mAbs may be a viable option for cancer patients with a relatively high PRSS level.",

Through systematic comparison of the gene expression data of these cell lines, we determined that the expression of PRSS family genes (including PRSS1, PRSS2, and PRSS3) was higher in the cetuximabresistant cell lines than that in the cetuximab-sensitive cell lines ( Fig. 1A and table S1).

These cell lines all express EGFR (fig. S1A), and cetuximab inhibits their proliferation and survival to varying degrees (fig. S1B). Consistent with previous findings (17, 25) , a cell growth assay showed that DiFi cells were cetuximab sensitive, LoVo and Caco-2 cells were moderately cetuximab sensitive, and HT-29 cells were cetuximab resistant. We examined PRSS1, PRSS2, and PRSS3 mRNA expression in the cell lines. Reverse transcription PCR showed that PRSS1 was significantly more highly expressed in the cetuximab-resistant cell lines than in the cetuximab-sensitive cell lines (Fig. 1B) ; PRSS2 and PRSS3 expression levels showed almost no differences between the cetuximab-resistant and cetuximab-sensitive cell lines. Next, we assessed the expression of PRSS1, an extracellular secreted protein, in the cell lines. As anticipated, PRSS1 was significantly more highly expressed in the cetuximab-resistant cell lines than in the cetuximab-sensitive cell lines (Fig. 1 , B to D), which was confirmed at the mRNA level by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Fig. 1C) and at the protein level by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B) and by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using an anti-PRSS1 antibody ( Fig. 1D) . Furthermore, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis showed that PRSS1 expression in tumor samples from cetuximab-resistant patients with mCRC was higher than that in samples from cetuximabsensitive patients with mCRC (Fig. 1E) . These results suggest that PRSS1 and cetuximab resistance are related.",

Hence, to further elucidate the role of PRSS1 in cetuximab resistance, we performed immunoblotting for phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), pERK, and pAKT in stable PRSS1 expression knockdown LoVo cells and HT-29 cells. pEGFR, pERK, and pAKT levels were increased in shPRSS1-1 and shPRSS1-2 cells compared with those in shSCRM (scrambled) cells (Fig. 2, A and B ).

As anticipated, ectopic PRSS1 expression in DiFi and LoVo cells decreased the cetuximab-mediated inhibition of pEGFR, pERK, and pAKT (Fig. 2 , C and D). In conclusion, PRSS1 expression knockdown increases the cetuximab-mediated inhibition of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK; conversely, ectopic PRSS1 expression decreases this inhibition.

We also noted that the colon cancer cell culture supernatant and recombinant human PRSS1 had the same pattern of cetuximab cleavage, indicating that PRSS1 in the cell culture supernatant cleaved the mAb (Fig. 3A) . As trypsin is a protein homologous to PRSS1, we considered whether the residual trypsin in the cell culture supernatant cleaved cetuximab after the cells underwent trypsin digestion. Accordingly, we used an ELISA to detect PRSS1 levels in the cell culture supernatant. PRSS1 levels in the cell culture supernatant at 0 hours were too low to be detected but increased over time ( fig.

To identify the cleavage site, we analyzed the N-terminal partial sequence of the cleaved heavy chain using the Edman cleavage procedure ( fig. S3A ). The N-terminal sequence of the cleaved heavy chain was Thr-Val-Ser-Ala-Ala-Ser-Thr-Lys-Gly-Pro-Ser-Val-Phe-Pro-Leu ( fig. S3B ), and cleavage occurred between Val 115 and Thr 116 ( fig. S3C ), a cleavage site that has never been reported. The cleavage site is between the variable heavy chain region and constant heavy chain region of the heavy chain, which is found not only in cetuximab but also in a multitude of mAbs, including bevacizumab and trastuzumab ( fig. S3C ). The culture supernatant of colon cancer cells and recombinant human PRSS1 also cleaved both bevacizumab and trastuzumab ( fig. S3 , D and E) and had almost identical cleavage patterns, which again indicated that PRSS1 secreted by the cancer cells cleaved the mAbs. Nevertheless, neither the culture supernatant of colon cancer cells nor recombinant human PRSS1 could cleave aflibercept, which does not have the potential cleavage site ( fig. S3F ). These results all suggest that PRSS1 in the culture supernatant of colon cancer cells can cleave a range of mAbs that harbor the potential cleavage site, including cetuximab, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab ( fig. S3D and E), decreasing the response to these mAbs and ultimately causing resistance to them. These findings all suggest that PRSS1 may cause cetuximab resistance by cleaving cetuximab to increasingly greater degrees.",

S4A ). The potential cleavage region of cetuximab differed from the cleavage regions of bevacizumab and trastuzumab by just one amino acid, which was alanine in cetuximab and serine in bevacizumab and trastuzumab ( fig.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the PRSS1-mediated cleavage of mAbs may be sequence specific and considered whether mutating some amino acids in the potential cleavage region could prevent the PRSS1-mediated cleavage of mAbs. To clarify the sequence specificity, the ZDOCK algorithm (28) (a built-in module of Accelrys Discovery Studio) was used to simulate the docking of cetuximab and PRSS1, whose conformations were derived from the crystal structures PDB:1YY8 and PDB:2RA3, respectively. Then, we designed and purified 10 mutant cetuximab mAbs, which each had a mutation in the cleavage region containing V115 and T116 and a potential recognition region containing S84, L114, and A120 based on the structural modeling and computational design (figs. S3C and S4B). The PRSS1-mediated cleavage of the mutant mAbs containing L114 and T116 was lower than that of cetuximab, while the PRSS1-mediated cleavage of the mutant mAbs containing V115 was greater than that of cetuximab ( fig. S4, C and D) . However, the PRSS1-mediated cleavage of the mutant mAbs containing S84 and A120 was almost identical to that of cetuximab ( fig. S4 , E and F).",

SBTI, ulinastatin, and recombinant human SPINK1 suppressed the proteolytic cleavage of bevacizumab by recombinant PRSS1 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); SPINK1 was the strongest inhibitor, while ulinastatin was the weakest (Fig. 4, A and B) . We also tested the inhibitory effect of SBTI on the proteolytic cleavage of cetuximab by a high concentration of PRSS1 in the HT-29 cell culture supernatant. Immunoblotting showed that SBTI barely suppressed the PRSS1-mediated cleavage of cetuximab in the cell culture supernatant (fig. S5, A and B) . As SPINK1 is overexpressed in multiple human cancers and increased serum SPINK1 levels have been correlated with aggressive disease, we assessed SPINK1 expression in colon cancer cell lines. SPINK1 expression was highest in SW480 cells (Fig. 4, C and D, and fig.

As expected, both SPINK1/cetuximab and SPINK1/ bevacizumab inhibited tumor growth more than either cetuximab or bevacizumab alone in HT-29 cell-xenografted mice (Fig. 5E ). Similar to the observation in the LoVo cell-xenografted mice ( fig.

We also assessed microvascular formation in xenograft tumor sections via staining for CD34 and endomucin. Immunofluorescence and IHC showed more significantly decreased microvascular formation in the HT-29 cell-xenografted mice treated with SPINK1 and bevacizumab than that in mice treated with either SPINK1 or bevacizumab alone ( Fig. 5G and fig. S6B ). CD34 was used to determine the microvascular density. On the basis of CD34 expression, we selected five highmagnification fields of view and counted the number of CD34-positive cells. CD34 expression was localized to microvascular endothelial cells in the xenograft tumor sections. Statistically significant decreases in the number of capillaries and the distribution of the microcirculation were noted in the xenograft tumors treated with SPINK1 and bevacizumab compared with those treated with either SPINK1 or bevacizumab alone (Fig. 5H and fig.

The serum PRSS1 levels of the patients (average, 59.43 ng/ml) were significantly higher than those of the healthy individuals (average, 34.00 ng/ml) ( fig. S7A ). Of the 156 patients, 52 received cetuximab monotherapy ( Fig. 6A and data file S1). The serum PRSS1 levels of the patients with primary cetuximab resistance (n = 20; average, 94.57 ng/ml) were significantly higher than those of the cetuximab-responsive patients (n = 32; average, 59.31 ng/ml) (Fig. 6B) . We also found that the patient serum PRSS1 levels before cetuximab treatment were significantly higher than those after cetuximab treatment (when disease progressed) ( Fig. 6C and data file S1). However, a difference was not observed between responders and nonresponders treated with chemotherapy alone ( fig. S7B and data file S1), and no difference was observed between the PRSS1 levels before chemotherapy and the PRSS1 levels after chemotherapy ( fig. S7C and data file S1). On the basis of whether the PRSS1 level exceeded the average PRSS1 level of all patients, we divided the patients receiving cetuximab monotherapy into two groups: high and low PRSS1 expression groups. Kaplan-Meier curves for these patients consistently demonstrated much worse overall survival (OS) for the patients with high PRSS1 than that for the patients with low PRSS1 median survival, 83 days versus 206 days, respectively; P = 0.009; Fig. 6D ), indicating that a high PRSS1 level was clearly related to a poor cetuximab response in mCRC. We conducted further analyses to determine whether the prognostic impact of PRSS1 expression is independent of other clinical variables.

As PRSS1 expression is very low in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tissue, we divided the patients with HNSCC who received cetuximab monotherapy (n = 36) into high PRSS3 expression (n = 20) and low PRSS1 expression groups (n = 16) based on the median PRSS3 level of the HNSCC tissue samples in the TCGA database. As expected, the patients with low PRSS3 expression had significantly longer PFS than the patients with high expression (median survival, 323 days versus 150 days, respectively; P = 0.0397; Fig. 6E ). Furthermore, we determined whether PRSS expression affected the prognosis of patients with cancer. Consistent with previous studies, we found no significant difference in OS between the high-and low-PRSS3 groups ( fig. S8A ). We also divided the patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who received bevacizumab monotherapy (n = 44) into high and low PRSS1 expression groups. The patients whose PRSS1 level exceeded the median PRSS1 level of all patients with colorectal carcinoma were assigned to the high-PRSS1 group (n = 24), and the remaining patients were assigned to the low-PRSS1 group (n = 20). Similar to the results for the patients with HNSCC, the patients with colorectal carcinoma with low PRSS1 expression had significantly longer PFS than the patients with high PRSS1 expression (median survival, 672 days versus 394 days, respectively; P = 0.0147; Fig. 6F and fig. S8B ). We also divided the patients with glioma who received bevacizumab monotherapy (n = 77) into two groups using the method used for the patients with HNSCC. Consistent with the results for the patients with HNSCC or colorectal carcinoma, the patients with glioma and low PRSS3 expression had longer PFS than the patients with high PRSS3 expression (median survival, 323 days versus 228 days, respectively; P = 0.0112; fig. S8, C and D) . The PRSS1 expression data were normalized in the patients with ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma. Consequently, we divided the patients who received bevacizumab monotherapy (n = 53) into a high-PRSS1 expression group, where PRSS1 expression was less than zero (n = 39), and the low-PRSS1 expression group, where PRSS1 expression was zero and above (n = 14). Kaplan-Meier analysis of these patients consistently demonstrated much worse survival durations in the high-PRSS1 patients than those in the low-PRSS1 patients (median survival, 196 days versus 337 days, respectively; P = 0.0315; fig. S8 , E and F). Together, these findings suggested that high PRSS expression levels were associated with poor responses to mAb treatment.",

We performed clinical validation using ELISA to measure serum PRSS1 levels in patients with mCRC receiving cetuximab treatment (data file S1). We collected serum samples from patients before treatment and every 4 to 8 weeks during treatment. The patients were categorized as partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease (PD) by radiological assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Among the 52 patients with mCRC who received cetuximab monotherapy, 25 patients with longitudinal serum samples eventually developed PD (data file S1). We compared changes in patient PRSS1 levels during antibody monotherapy and imaging results and found that PRSS1 levels gradually increased and reached a high level when PD occurred ( fig. S8G and data file S1). Specifically, compared with tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), the circulating levels of PRSS1 in 16 of 25 patients were better correlated with the treatment outcome and reached a nadir when the best response to cetuximab was obtained. The levels of PRSS1 increased before tumor progression as determined by computerized tomography (CT). For nine patients, the PRSS1 levels during treatment did not appear to be associated with the treatment outcome; we postulate that these patients may have hyperactivation of the EGFR pathway downstream of the receptor or hyperactivation of other related pathways, which would uncouple PRSS1 secretion from the response to cetuximab treatment. Together, our findings indicated that serum PRSS1 levels correlated with treatment outcome according to standard radiological assessments.",

Previous data have shown that mCRC lesions harboring KRAS and BRAF mutations are highly associated with a poor prognosis and poor objective response to cetuximab therapy (15, 33) . Therefore, investigation of the mechanism of mAb resistance and identification of useful biomarkers for mAb therapy may guide treatment selection and have a significant clinical impact and are greatly warranted.

Further analysis revealed that PRSS1 levels were closely associated with cetuximab resistance in mCRC. PRSS, which is produced and secreted by cancer cells, also mediates pro-urokinase and pro-matrix metalloproteinase activation, thus promoting/facilitating angiogenesis and tumor invasion by digesting components of the extracellular matrix (24) . The present findings raise the possibility that PRSS1 is a crucial determinant of resistance to cetuximab therapy in mCRC. First, we found significantly higher PRSS1 expression in cetuximab-resistant cells than that in cetuximabsensitive cells. Second, exogenous addition of PRSS1-enriched medium to human colon cancer cells (DiFi and LoVo cells) increased cetuximab resistance. Conversely, silencing PRSS1 in LoVo and HT-29 cells conferred cetuximab sensitivity. Third, both recombinant PRSS1 and the cell culture supernatants of the tested colon cancer cell lines cleaved cetuximab in the same manner. Furthermore, the most thorough cleavage was observed with the supernatant of HT-29 cells, which were the most resistant to cetuximab. Fourth, PRSS1 expression knockdown increased the cetuximab-mediated inhibition of pEGFR, pAKT, and pERK, while ectopic expression of PRSS1 decreased this inhibition. Therefore, we mechanistically demonstrated that PRSS1 cleaves mAbs, i.e., cetuximab, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, thus decreasing the response to these antibodies and ultimately causing antibody resistance. Together, these findings suggest that PRSS may lead to antibody resistance by cleaving antibodies, eventually decreasing their efficacy.",

We also found that the PRSS1-mediated cleavage of mAbs was sequence specific and that modifying the amino acids L114 or T116 decreased the degree of mutant mAb cleavage by PRSS1 ( fig. S4, C and D) , which may be a theoretical basis for mAb modification. SPINK1 protects the pancreas from autodigestion by preventing the activation of pancreatic proteases (26) . Unlike other inhibitors, namely, SBTI and ulinastatin, SPINK1 significantly suppressed the PRSS1-mediated cleavage of cetuximab and bevacizumab in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed that SPINK1 and cetuximab or bevacizumab had an additive effect on the inhibition of HT-29 and LoVo cell proliferation. This finding is consistent with the results of a report showing that combining mAbs with SPINK1 and EGFR led to a supra-additive reduction in the growth and invasion of SPINK1 + 22RV1 cells (31) . Furthermore, concomitant tumor expression of EGFR and TATI/SPINK1 is associated with a better prognosis in CRC (35) , indicating that anti-EGFR mAbs may produce a better response in SPINK1 + CRC cells, which further supports our findings.",

Moreover, administering cetuximab to mice bearing LoVo xenografts attenuated tumor growth by more than 29% and by approximately 46% when combined with SPINK1 (Fig. 5, A, B, and D) . Administering SPINK1 alone to mice bearing HT-29 or LoVo xenografts promoted tumor growth (Fig. 5, A, B, and D) , which is consistent with previous studies reporting that extracellular SPINK1 promotes cell proliferation by down-regulating metallothionein expression (26) and interacting with EGFR to activate downstream signaling as SPINK1 is structurally similar to EGF (31). Together, our findings indicate that the functional significance of PRSS1 in cetuximab resistance warrants further investigation to identify a more effective inhibitor of PRSS1 as a therapy for patients with mCRC.

We also found that the serum PRSS1 level increased after cetuximab administration and verified that anti-EGFR drugs induced PRSS1 secretion events specific to drug responses or resistance. Furthermore, ELISA showed that patients with mCRC had significantly higher serum PRSS1 levels than healthy individuals ( fig.

Kaplan-Meier curves consistently demonstrated much worse survival for patients with high PRSS1 expression than that for patients with very low PRSS1 expression (Fig. 6D) , indicating that PRSS1 levels are clearly related to poor responses to cetuximab in mCRC. Analyses of patients with other cancers who received antibody monotherapy revealed that all patients with low PRSS1 or PRSS3 expression had longer PFS than patients with high PRSS1 or PRSS3 expression regardless of whether the patients had HNSCC (Fig. 6E) , colorectal adenocarcinoma (Fig. 6F), glioma (fig.
