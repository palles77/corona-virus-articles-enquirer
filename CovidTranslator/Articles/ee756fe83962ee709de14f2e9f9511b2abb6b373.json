Not only has m-Health revolutionized service delivery in key areas related to family health, it has also improved approaches to prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including mental health. The capacity for epidemic or pandemic preparedness and response has improved disease surveillance, outbreak detection and management with the advancement of better communication platforms and monitoring systems through m-Health. More than ever before, m-Health has expanded the capacity for knowledge dissemination, health behavior change and better self-health practices at the individual, community and population level matrices. This has undoubtedly improved community participation in disease prevention programs as well as advocacy and policy dialogues for effective health promotion. Table 11 .1 summarizes the context in which m-Health has been successfully applied in public health practice.",

According to 2016 UNICEF data, only about 50% of women worldwide receive the recommended level of care during pregnancy. The report revealed a global disparity between the proportion of pregnant women who received antenatal care with a skilled health personnel at least once (86%) and those who attended the recommended minimum of four visits (62%), with wider disparities observed in sub-Saharan Africa (52%) and South Asia (46%) where maternal mortality rates are highest [1] . Literature has highlighted successful applications of m-Health technologies in improving antenatal, midwifery and post-natal care in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) [2] . Evidence from RCTs and other studies conducted in Zanzibar, Thailand, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Nigeria [3e7] suggests that the use of textmessaging and/or voice messaging (singly or in combination with ancillary interventions such as provision of call vouchers, toll-free case management hotline, finance vouchers, micro health insurance etc) to provide health education and appointment reminders to pregnant mothers significantly improved antenatal care visits, skilled attendance at birth, post-natal care and health facility utilization rates. In addition, these interventions enhanced communication between healthcare workers and pregnant women, and between healthcare workers and traditional birth attendants [6] . Variable results regarding the effectiveness of these interventions in improving antenatal care knowledge [8, 9] or breast-and infant feeding practices [10, 11] have also been reported.",

For example, the United Nations Foundation-funded WAHA International's m-Health program implemented in the Tambacounda region in eastern Senegal employed a comprehensive communication and transportation support strategy in which a mass communication campaign via SMS was provided to the general community to sensitize them on the locally available maternal and neonatal health services, while targeted SMS communication campaign was provided to pregnant women and new mothers to inform them of the importance of ANC visits, delivery with a skilled birth attendant, and postnatal care. The project addressed transportation barriers through the implementation of a motorcycle ambulance system, a call center to efficiently manage the referral system, and provision of mobile phones to ambulance drivers to coordinate the referral process. Additionally, women who attended ANC consultations were provided with a mobile phone SIM card for receiving informational messages or for contacting a healthcare worker at the call center, in addition to receiving additional credit as an incentive for attending their antenatal care consultation at the health care facility [12] . Where such interventions are fully integrated with the existing health care system, the potential to achieve project outcomes and sustainability while also meeting clients' expectations are further enhanced.",

As at 2010, a worldwide contraceptive prevalence of 63.3% and an unmet need for family planning of 12.3% was reported among women aged 15e49 years who were married or in a union [17] . By 2015, the global contraceptive prevalence had marginally increased to 63.6%, while the unmet need for family planning dropped to 11.9% [18] . Unmet need is especially higher among adolescents, migrants, urban slum dwellers, refugees and women in the postpartum period. These less than desirable statistics on family planning, the projected growth in the number of contraceptive users worldwide worsened by severe shortages in skilled providers, has catalyzed the need for increased investments and more innovative solutions to address the gaps, with m-Health offering promising results in this regard. The adoption of m-Health technologies in providing the information that couples need to make informed family planning decisions or address their concerns regarding same, has been largely successful [19] . For example, the United Nations foundation-funded Mobile for Reproductive Health (m4RH) [20] and Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA) [15] projects provide evidence-based results in this area. FHI360's m4RH e implemented in Kenya and Tanzania e developed family planning text messages based on best practices from health communication programs, guided by international and context-specific standards. The SMS were delivered to men and women through an automated, interactive and on-demand text message (SMS) system that provides essential facts about contraception while addressing common misconceptions. In addition, the system allowed users to locate nearby family planning clinics. Similarly, MAMA developed and disseminated adaptable messages based on WHO and UNICEF guidelines, to extend hospital-based support provided to pregnant women by providing them with health information and promotional messages regarding pregnancy, postnatal and child care.",

While majority of these innovations have explored the ubiquitous availability of mobile phones to target pregnant women and new mothers with simple SMS reminders on immunization clinic appointments, others have employed specialized mobile apps that enhance real-time update and reporting of vaccination records, as well as vaccination schedule and stocks monitoring. For example, the United Nations and WHO worked in partnership with stakeholders in Vietnam [31] , Nepal [32] and Pakistan [33] to address the issue of poor vaccination coverage using variety of m-Health solutions described above. In one of such robust systems implemented by PATH in Ben Tre Province, Southern Vietnam, the project sought to enhance real time access to immunization data, and also allow timely generation of reports at the community health center and district level. The project implemented a digital immunization registry system comprising of a web-based application accessible via smartphone or computer, allowing mother-infant pairs to be registered and receive SMS reminders on immunization clinic appointments and also track the vaccines received. The system also improves the quality and efficiency of services provided by the healthcare workers by generating reports on the number and types of vaccine they need to administer every month as well as the list of individuals due for vaccination, thereby reducing the chances of stock-out of essential vaccines and commodities and minimizing drop-outs or loss to follow up. In the long-term, the project aimed to replace the existing paper-based immunization registry system with a more efficient and reliable digital system that improves performance and confidence in the health care system.",

In many developing countries, undernutrition remains a very important cause of mortality among children under 5 years, accounting for nearly 50% of all deaths in this age group (about 3 million annual deaths) [35] . Not only does undernutrition increase the risk of children dying from common infectious diseases, it also worsens the frequency, severity and chances of recovery from these diseases, with increased potential for worse outcomes among undernourished children less than 1000 days old. Child undernutrition has a very important association with nutritional status of their mothers. Children whose mothers are underweight (with a body mass index less than 18.5 kg/m 2 ) are much more likely to be stunted, wasted and underweight than other children [36] .",

One of such innovative use of m-Health is the United Nations Foundation-funded Society for the Elimination of Rural Poverty's (SERP) mobile Nutritional Day Care Centers (mNDCC) project implemented in rural Andhra Pradesh India [37] to improve monitoring and reporting between local and state-level actors, enhance tracking of nutrition, health status and behavior of clients enrolled in the program. The project uses the mNDCC device e a mobile handset with several modules e to survey, enroll, track and report the health (hemoglobin level, immunization status, antenatal care and prenatal care), nutrition (feeding practices, growth monitoring) and behavior (daily attendance at the NDCCs) of enrollees. Based on the information inputted into the system, relevant health-related action can be taken based on software-generated alerts as well as decision-making on other program-related matters including financial information. The mNDCC provides real-time data to guide timely decision-making on the functionality and performance of the women's self-help groups (NDCC).",

A variety of m-Health approaches are available for addressing alcohol misuse or dependence, many of which rely on the different functionalities of mobile phones available to clients [51] , the most basic and popular approach being text messaging. While the evidence regarding the efficacy of text messaging in achieving alcohol abstinence have been largely variable [51e54], newer approaches of using smartphone-based alcohol abstinence apps have been shown to be more effective [55] . Many such apps exist, and while systematic studies evaluating their comparative efficacy in promoting reductions in alcohol consumption or treating Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) are relatively sparse, initial evidence suggest beneficial effects in this regard [56, 57] . For example, the Alcohol e Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) which is a relapse prevention app for individuals in recovery for alcohol dependence who have been recently discharged from residential care, is reported to provide the strongest evidence of efficacy [58] compared to other apps for AUD (such as Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention system for Alcohol use disorders (LBMI-A), Promillekoll, PartyPlanner, HealthCall-S, and Chimpshop), with participants in a recent RCT who received A-CHESS reporting significantly fewer risky drinking days over a 12-month period as well as higher likelihood of abstinence than controls [56] . The A-CHESS is GPS-enabled and has a number of inbuilt support features to encourage sobriety, such as a warning noise when users get too close to a bar, and a panic button that the user can press if they're thinking about drinking or buying alcohol. The button contacts the user's closest peers and medical professionals who can reach out and discourage the person from relapsing (Fig. 11.1 ). While the patient is waiting for a response, it offers them links to potentially helpful materials such as tutorials on relaxation exercises.",

            "text": "In the last decade, the world has witnessed several pandemics/epidemics from emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as Avian Influenza, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika, etc causing morbidity and mortality of devastating proportions especially in developing countries. Emerging zoonoses underscores the growing need for all countries to develop capacities to rapidly detect, contain, respond to, and cope with such pandemics. Central to achieving this is the development and maintenance of a robust surveillance, outbreak detection and management capacity. Traditional approaches to surveillance, outbreak detection and management are often too cumbersome and faced with a lot of challenges and inefficiencies in communication, contact tracing, skilled manpower and other infrastructural issues, that militate against rapid containment of outbreaks, hence resulting in devastating outcomes. Lessons learnt from the 2014/2015 Ebola Viral Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa suggest that more robust surveillance and outbreak management infrastructure are needed [59] . Incidentally, the burden of these infectious diseases is highest in developing countries where capacity for rapid containment is often limited. The high penetration of mobile phones in these countries offer a significant opportunity to leverage m-Health technologies in overcoming many of the communication, transportation and outbreak management challenges in these settings [60, 61] . A variety of m-Health tools and apps with diverse functionalities have been developed and tested for many diseases such as EVD, H1N1, polio, dengue fever, SARS, MERS-CoV, malaria, measles etc, including with general disease surveillance functionalities. For example, the open source \"SORMAS\" [62] , \"Ebola Sense Followup\" [63] and \"CommCare\" [64] tools were tested during the EVD outbreak and included functionalities such as surveillance notification, contact tracing, case management, automated GPS tracking, tailored health-specific user profiles with variable functionalities, laboratory function and rumor management, enabled on smartphones and/or tablets.",

One of such applications is in facilitating early infant diagnosis of HIV and follow-up and retention of mothers and their exposed infants in Nigeria [65] , Kenya [66] and Malawi [67] . in Nigeria utilized text messaging to rapidly communicate infants' HIV test results from laboratories to the health facilities, especially those in very remote hardto-reach locations with irregular power supply, limited skilled manpower and internet access. This approach has facilitated instant transfer (from the laboratory to health facility) of test results which can be printed out from the battery-operated SMS printers to enhance timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and limit loss-to-follow up [68] .",
