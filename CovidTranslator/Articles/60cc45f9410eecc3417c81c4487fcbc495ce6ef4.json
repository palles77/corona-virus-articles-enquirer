            "text": "Env processing. PM1 cells stably expressing shRNA against IFITM1, 2 or 3 were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped NL43; 48 hours after infection, virions were harvested and purified from supernatant and cells pellets were lysed by RIPA buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation and western blots. We constantly found that IFITM3 and IFITM1 shRNA-expressing cells were more vulnerable to NL43 infection, exhibiting rapidly syncytia formation and cell death, as reflected by relatively low GAPDH expression (lane 3 and 5, bottom panel) (B) . Possible reason include that shRNA IFITM1 can cross-knock down both IFITM1 and IFITM3, while IFITM3 shRNA can knockdown all three IFITMs (See Figure 2A) , resulting in significant viral infection and rapid syncytia formation thus cell death. Quantification of Env processing was performed by calculating gp120/gp160 or gp41/gp160 ratio (C). Results represent 2-5 independent experiments, * p < 0.05. Purified virions from PM1 cells were analyzed for gp120, gp41 and p24 (D). Figure S3 . Analysis of interactions between IFITM chimeras and HIV-1 Env. Related to Figure 3 . Methods and procedures are the same as was described in Figure 3 for parental IFITMs except that some IFITM mutants were transfected into 293T cells for analysis. Figure S4 . Effects of IFITM3 on the processing and interactions with HIV-1 Env mutants. Related to Figure 6 . Experimental approaches were the same as described for HIV-1 WT in the Figure 3 legend, except that HIV-1 escape mutant EnvA539V and the Env\u2206CT construct were analyzed. (A) Upper panels indicate cell lysates input, and lower panels show immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-FLAG conjugated beads. Note that while the EnvA539V escape mutant was still associated with IFITM3 as the Env WT, the Env\u2206CT mutant substantially lost its interaction with IFITM3 as evidenced by reduced anti-gp160 and gp41 blots. Also note that the anti-gp41 antibody, 2F5, which was used here, was not efficient to detect immunoprecipiated gp41 even though it can reasonably detect gp41 protein from cell lysates; we cannot use Chassie 8 antibody here as was used in Figure 3 because it was generated against the CT of HIV-1 Env and would not be able to detect the Env\u2206CT. (B) Upper panels indicate concentrated virion inputs, and lower panels show immunoprecipitation of virions HIV-Ig conjugated beads. Note equivalent gp120 in virions for Env\u2206CT with or without IFITM3, supporting the conclusion that Env\u2206CT is resistant to IFITM3. Figure 7 . Experimental procedures were the same as described in Figure 7 , except that the absolute luciferase activities of viral infections were plotted and shown. Note some differences between cell-to-cell and cell-free infections of the same virus in the absence of IFITMs, as well as the differences between different viruses in cellto-cell or cell-free infection. For example, despite extremely low cell-free infection of SIVcpz in HeLa-TZM cells, the cell-to-cell transmission/fusion of SIVcpz between 293T and HeLa-TZM was quite efficient. In contrast, the cell-to-cell infection of HIV-1 YU2 from Jurkat/inGluc to PBMCs was extremely low compared to other viruses, yet the cell-free infection of YU2 in PBMCs was comparable to that of NL43 and BH10. We cannot rule out the possibility that these differential patterns may be cell type-dependent. Comparisons between cell-to-cell (first 4 columns) and cell-free infections (second 4 columns) of different HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV strains are also shown in (E) and (F). The fold differences are indicated. Results represent 2-5 independent experiments, with all samples done in duplicates. ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
