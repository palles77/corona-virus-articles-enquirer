But recently, this disease has been witnessed in other regions to a large extent and can become an epidemic very soon. In this paper, a new fog computing based e-Healthcare framework has been proposed to monitor the KFD infected patients in an early phase of infection and control the disease outbreak. For ensuring high prediction rate, a novel Extremal Optimization tuned Neural Network (EO-NN) classification algorithm has been developed using hybridization of the extremal optimization with the feed-forward neural network. Additionally, a location based alert system has also been suggested to provide the global positioning system (GPS)-based location information of each KFD infected user and the risk-prone zones as early as possible to prevent the outbreak. Furthermore, a comparative study of proposed EO-NN with state of art classification algorithms has been carried out and it can be concluded that EO-NN outperforms others with an average accuracy of 91.56%, a sensitivity of 91.53% and a specificity of 97.13% respectively in classification and accurate identification of risk-prone areas.",

Globally, the incidence of tick-borne diseases is increasing gradually. A species of forest tick named Haemaphysalis spinigera is responsible for causing the deadly tick-borne viral disease Kyasanur forest disease (KFD).This highly infectious KFD and other closely related tick borne diseases have been causing periodic outbreaks in India and some other countries like China, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt etc. which result in the death of thousands of lives over the decade.",

            "text": "KFD is an infectious disease in monkey and also termed as monkey fever in India. It is a tick-borne viral disease endemic in southern India that is caused by a highly pathogenic virus called KFD virus (KFDV) which belongs to the family of genus flavi virus and family flavidae. Ticks once infected, remain so for life and can pass KFDV to offspring by laying eggs. The larvae appear after the monsoon, and the nymphs start appearing in November or December. The nymphs feed on infected monkeys that serve as blood meal for these ticks. After that, these nymphs bite humans and thus picking up and passing on the virus. Cattle act as host to amplify and distribute the population of ticks but play no role in the KFD virus transmission. Figure 1 shows the KFD virus ecology to spread the disease [2] . In the enzootic state, KFDV spreads through small mammals such as rodents, shrews, ground birds, etc. [3] . When monkeys and the small mammals come in contact with the infected ticks, they also get infected and promulgate the infection. The people who visited forests to collect firewood, grass, and other forest products or pass through the forest are bitten by the infected nymphs of the tick (Haemaphysalis spinigera). Moreover, humans living near forest interfaces get infected on tick bite. This way the infection circulates among humans. Very recently thousands of ticks suspected to have KFDV related virus were collected from migratory birds captured in the Mediterranean basin. The results indicate that birds could also contribute to spreading the virus to new geographical areas. Due to the lack of post-exposure treatment options for KFDV infections, the priority is given to the screening of replication inhibiting drugs against the virus [4] .",

            "text": "Kyasanur Forest Disease virus (KFDV) was first identified in 1957, in the Kyasanur forest area of Shimoga district after few deaths of monkeys. It became a threat when humans started to die in the neighbourhood areas (Sagar Taluk, Shimoga District, Karnataka, India). Since then, 400 to 500 human cases per year have been reported [5] . During the initial outbreak, there were 466 human cases and 181 more in the following year. In 2003, KFD had affected more than 70 villages in four districts adjacent to Shimoga in western Karnataka. Until 2012 KFD had been endemic to five districts (Shimoga, U ttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada, Chikkamagaluru and Udupi districts) of Karnataka state [5, 6] . In that period, a total of 3263 suspected KFD cases with 823 confirmed cases and 28 deaths were reported in those districts [7] . During 2012-2013, the disease was reported from new districts and new states in India. The KFD virus has spread into several regions within Karnataka state and surrounding Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Goa states [6, 8, 9] . Pieces of evidence of KFD virus or related virus were found in different parts of India (parts of the Saurashtra region in Gujarat, forest region west of Kolkata, West Bengal, and the Andaman Islands) after serological studies. It is found that 22.4% of people living in the Andaman and Nicobar islands are seropositive. KFD hit Wayanad, Kerala hard in 2015, infecting 102 people and killing 11, according to the district health department. The forest department, for its part, recorded the death of 400 monkeys. In the starting of 2017, a string of monkey fever cases was detected from neighbouring state Maharashtra after the disease left 3 dead and hundreds infected in Goa in 2016, according to the state health officials. According to Sindhudurg District Health officials, a total number of infected cases in the state has risen to 187 in 2017, from 128 in 2016 [10] . Maharashtra state health authorities have detected 45 cases of KFD in Sindhudurg district over the first 2 months of 2017 of which 3 persons have died and with this, the death toll has increased to 11 since 2016. Moreover, according to forest officials, more than 40 monkeys were found dead in Sindhudurg forests between January-May in 2017 [10] . Seventy-three cases of KFD have been detected, including one each at Patradevi in Pernem taluka and Savoi Verem in Ponda taluka in Goa since January 2017. With this, the KFD death toll in the taluk stood at 3. As per the state health officials of Goa, since January 2018, at least 35 people in Sattari taluka of North Goa have been tested positive with KFD. KFDV is common in young adults exposed during the dry season in the forest and has caused epidemic outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever affecting so many people per year since then, with a fatality rate that is estimated between 2 to 10% [7, 8] . The increasing number of new foci and cases indicates that eco-biological changes due to deforestation and use of new land for farming and cattle grazing could lead to spread of KFD virus to newer geographical areas. Viruses related to KFDV have been identified in China [11] and Saudi Arabia [12] [13] [14] also. Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (AHFV) in Saudi Arabia and other regions of the Middle East and Nanjianyin Virus identified in Yunnan, China are found closely related to KFDV. Even in France, an average of 500-600 cases of KFD occur per year, with a 3.6% case fatality rate.",

So there is a serious need of an active KFD surveillance system that can find all the KFD related cases and take necessary actions upon it. Usually in many health monitoring systems, remote cloud servers have been used for storing and processing of the medical big data collected from a large pool of sensors and devices due to its capability of large storage volume, lack of unnecessary maintenance cost and inexpensive services. However, it can experience several issues regarding latency and data transmission which are the most crucial requirements for any healthcare system. Especially, in latency-sensitive cases such as medical emergency situations, a minor error in analysed data can cause wrong diagnosis which can risk a human life. In this respect the fog computing technology can be a proper solution to fulfil the requirement. The fog layer places itself between the conventional gateway and remote cloud server and offers pre-processing of data and other advanced services at the edge of the network. In addition, fog computing offers embedded data mining, low-latency real time response and notification service at the edge of network and reduces the burden of cloud. Considering these features, fog computing can be convenient for human healthcare systems.",

ANN was chosen as a classifier to diagnose the thyrotoxicosis disease and compared its performance with other classifiers [17] . Whereas another research work presented a healthcare information management system based on mobile application and cloud computing together for better sharing, storing, updating, and retrieval of electronic healthcare data. A prototype has been implemented using Android operating system, and it was evaluated using the Amazon S3 cloud service [18] . Some authors build a real-time predictive model for diagnosis of the dengue fever with high accuracy rate. They have developed a novel imputation procedure for identifying and imputing missing values in the dataset. Moreover, a wrapper-based feature selection strategy using genetic search was developed to extract the most likely symptoms of dengue fever [19] . A cloud-based intelligent system for diabetic patients was also established. In their methodology principal component analysis (PCA) was used for identifying minimum correlative variables from collected attribute variables. Naive Bayes and knearest neighbour classifiers were used to classify infected and uninfected users [20] . Another strategy for diabetic patient classification was proposed by combining J48 decision tree, Bagging, and AdaBoost using J48 as a base learner. They performed the experimentation using Weka tool [21] . Some other researchers worked on a cloud-based health care system that aggregates the data from the Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) and later then the real-time analytics were done by combining the concept of STORM and the fuzzy logic [22] . A cloud-based monitoring model was also established to control the outbreak of Pandemic Influenza A(H1N1). Their methodology used a random decision tree to classify the infection in patient depending on H1N1 attributes. The system additionally introduced the concept of SNA graph and Outbreak Role Index to prevent the outbreak and to aware the users about how much they are probable to get infected respectively [23] . A web-based system was developed to predict dengue and identify the dengue hotspot areas, trends, outbreak behaviour, and case rate. For prediction, they used feed-forward ANN algorithm. For displaying the case rates, trends and prediction Google chart were used. Additionally, Google map and Google heat map was utilized to plot the dengue cases and the hotspot districts respectively [24] . A two layer strategy for diagnosing the condition of heart was proposed [25] . The work involved classifying the heart health attributes using KNN algorithm and predicting the rate of heart disease using a tree based ID3 algorithm. A cloudbased system was proposed to predict the airborne disease MERS-CoV, infected patients. For that, they used Bayesian belief network and additionally the system provides geographic-based risk assessment to control its outbreak [26] . A Fog-based zika virus outbreak monitoring system was also established where a fuzzy k-nearest neighbour is used to predict the possible infected users according to their clinical symptoms. Moreover, they implemented a Google Fig. 2 Proposed architecture of KFD prediction system map assisted representation of infected locations for risk assessment [27] . They also proposed another similar model to prevent zika virus by using a naive Bayesian network (NBN) as the classifier [28] . On the contrary, other researchers established an IoT and fog based model for controlling chikungunya virus attack. To diagnose the disease, they used fuzzy c-means as a classifier. Additionally, the real-time status of the outbreak was tracked continuously by using social network analysis (SNA) [29] .",

It can be defined as a process of in-depth extraction of underlying information, previously obscure and conceivably valuable information from the database [31] . Data mining mainly uses two strategies: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, a set of training examples is used to learn model parameters while in unsupervised learning no such training set is utilized [32] . The two most in-general objectives of data mining are classification and prediction. Classification models predict discrete and unordered functions whereas prediction model deals with the prediction of continuous-valued functions [33, 34] . For prediction of coronary disease, researchers proposed a method on a premise of coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) by hybridizing the neural network with the fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm [35] . Another group of authors used the neural network with back propagation algorithm to predict heart disease, blood pressure and sugar in the human body [36] . After analysis, it was found that Neural Networks predict heart disease with the highest accuracy as compared to other data mining classifiers namely Decision Trees and Naive Bayes techniques [37] . Many studies was focused on hepatitis classification and feature reduction by using genetic algorithm [38] , simulated annealing [39] and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [40] . For prediction, hepatitis information obtained from related patients is taken as instances to neural network (NN) algorithm, and fuzzy logic [40] . Whereas in another work, different types of neural network algorithms (Quick, Multiple, Dynamic and RBFN) with different factors (data size, learning cycle, and processing time to achieve the diagnostic accuracy and estimated error) are applied on the UCI dataset to predict hepatitis disease [41] . In hepatitis classification studies, other researchers achieved prediction diagnosis accuracies of 83.2%, 85.3%, and 86.4%, using Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and LDA techniques respectively [42] . Prediction of Parkinson's disease has also been done using a radial basis function neural network based on particle swarm optimization [43] . An artificial neural network-based model has been developed for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease using a complex of traditional and genetic factors [44] . For training the network, they used a dataset that consists clinical, functional, laboratory, coronary angiographic, and genetic features acquired from several patients. By varying the number of input factors applied in the neural network, they created models which provide 64 to 94% accuracy. Proposed system Figure 2 represents the proposed architecture to monitor and detect KFD infected cases. The three main working scenarios of the proposed system have been illustrated in this section.",

Data pre-processing prepare raw data for further processing. Every MDC is equipped with this component that is configured with a data mining algorithm and a training data set to act upon the data collected from various sources. According to the nature of the sources and response, all the attributes acquired from various sources through numerous devices and sensors are divided into four groups namely, personal, clinical, serological and forestry. The lists of multiple personal and clinical attributes of the user have been shown in Tables 1 and 2 respectively whereas Table 3 lists different types of devices and sensors that can be used for data acquisition. The personal attributes are generally unchanged for most of the periods, whereas KFD attributes can change over the time. The location and other KFD related attributes collected from department of health, forest and serology are also stored separately. All the tables are interrelated so that every field related to KFD can monitor and predict the disease collectively. The values of all these parameters are stored in KFD database. In this work, all the clinical attributes are signs and symptoms of KFD though these are not exclusive for this disease. But some specific combination of these attributes are highly suggestive of KFD and can be graded as different KFD susceptibility classes. The initial prodromal stage of KFD in a patient is brought on by a sudden onset of a fever and severe headache along with a sore throat or neck pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, photophobia and severe pain in the lower and upper extremities. The inflammation of the conjunctiva (red eye) is also usually observed. The next stage is characterized by haemorrhagic complications such as low BP (hypotension), bloody nose (intermittent epistaxis), blood in vomit Fig. 3 Association of different KFD related data sources (hematemesis), blood in stool (melena) and frank blood in the stool. At the severe stage, neurological manifestations such as mental disturbance, tremors, abnormal reflexes, bronchopneumonia or development of coma, giddiness, and vision deficits are generally observed. So all these clinical attributes along with some necessary serological attributes such as platelet count, RBC and WBC count have been included in the synthetic dataset. Additionally, the acquired GPS locations from multiple users have also been considered to confirm whether the locations lie in a risk-prone zone or not. An area where a monkey death is reported is more likely to be a risky zone as KFD may be a cause of death of the monkey which can be transmitted to human. Similarly, the positive response of season has been reviewed in this component since season plays an important role in the transmission of KFD as more often cases are seen in dry season. The occupation attribute has also been considered because KFD is more often seen in hunters, foresters, wood-cutters etc. The KFD has been categorized depending upon these attributes. If some general prodromal symptoms are observed with the two most important attributes namely GPS location and occupation then the case is regarded as a suspected. In addition, if some haemorrhagic symptoms are observed on top of that then it is regarded as a probable case and if neurological symptoms are also positive then it is categorized as a confirmed or highly susceptible case. A set of these important attributes will be used for prediction at the MDC whereas the aggregated pre-processed data will be sent to the cloud server for further in-depth analysis. Figure 3 shows a graphical representation of sample KFD dataset generation with possible combinations of attributes.",

Once a tick gets on someone's body or cloths, they are likely to be there for many days if not checked properly. When they are in a desirable spot, they bite into the skin and begin to draw blood and remain attached to human body. After feeding, ticks may move to another body and bite or produce infected offspring by laying eggs. In this way ticks spread virus in urban areas also, even though they are far away from the forest areas. So, the humans or localities in vicinity of any infected person is also considered under the high risk prone zones which should be identified as soon as possible to control the spread of the virus. So instead of considering residential address only, the current geographic location of an infected user has been used here to distinguish and isolate the risk-prone areas. The objective of this module is to provide the real time information regarding the identification of infected population which can be a tough job for the government health authorities. After identifying the risk-prone zones, alert messages and infection control guidelines will be sent to the people close to those locations to control the spread of KFDV infection. The infected users will be diagnosed and monitored meticulously until their infection is fully recovered. In order to identify a newly infected user and risk-prone zone, the fog server has been committed to acquire continuous data from the user. Google Maps Javascript API [45] has been used to locate the infectious regions according to their GPS locations. The Google map represents and updates the risk-prone zones automatically to help the uninfected users and government healthcare agencies in controlling the spread of infection. Algorithm 2 has been developed to precisely locate the infected users and the risk-prone zones in real time scenario. Figure 6 shows the Google map based visualization of the KFD infected user along with the risk-prone zones. The highly suspicious infected users have been denoted by a red coloured pin whereas a probable case has been represented by a yellow star. Moreover, the risk-prone zones have been represented with shaded circles. Here, the Cachar district, Assam, India and its surrounding regions have been taken as references to show the Google map based alert service. For example, user at the location of latitude 24.99017, and longitude 92.59541 has been found highly suspicious and user at the location of latitude 24.94613, and longitude 92.76288 has been found probable. In addition, an alert will be sent to all the registered users who fall within the risk-prone areas to avoid from the contact of KFDV infection. Furthermore, an alert message with a list of guidelines will also be sent to all the registered users within the risk-prone areas. This alert system warns the users to follow the guidelines to control the further spreading of the infection. The prevention suggestions have been structured as shown in Table 5 . ",

To form the database, twenty-four different KFD attributes from the different attribute sets were associated together for the diagnosis of any user with KFDV infection.

Figure 9c illustrates the obtained specificity levels for all the classifiers in every testcases. It has been observed that the maximum specificity obtained by the EO-NN is 97.5% whereas for the respectively. Since the maximum MCC obtained for EO-NN is the nearest to 1, it has been treated as the most favourable result among all. Furthermore, the maximum F-Measure observed for the EO-NN is 0.905 which is nearest to 1 and thus considered as the best classification result. Even from the Fig. 9e it has been observed that the EO-NN outperforms other classifiers with least error rates (EMA and ERMS).

The proposed framework has been designed to monitor a large number of patients simultaneously by acquiring their clinical symptoms along with personal, and environmental data and transmitting the data to a dedicated Fog layer. Each Fog layer has been configured with a set of micro data centers which are distributed geographically and can handle the patient's big data in real time. From the data, the system will be able to perform inference locally that results in reducing the latency time and communication cost. The proposed EO-NN classifier has been developed for prediction of the KFD susceptibility to the user based on their symptoms, and cloud computing technology has been suggested for effective information analysis and sharing. The EO-NN provides good classification rate with an average accuracy of 91.56%. Moreover, the suggested location based alert services help to display KFDV-infected users and the risk-prone zones on Google map that will help the citizens to avoid regional exposure.
