The sequences, which include all 8 serotypes, were used to predict secondary structures, postulate possible functional domains, reveal conserved regions suitable for nucleic acid amplification and perform phylogenetic analysis. The final nucleotides of the capsid protein precursor gene and the adjacent 3-noncoding region were highly conserved and, except for 35 nucleotides with homology to a sequence in the 3-end of a coronavirus RNA genome, unique to astrovirus family. This confirms that the 3-end is a suitable target for universal and specific detection of astrovirus RNA. For the deduced 72 C-terminal amino acids of the capsid protein precursor, distances between the serotypes were found to vary from 0.1 substitution per site between serotypes 3 and 7 to more than one substitution per site between serotype 4 and the other serotypes. Different isolates of the same serotype were closely related, which indicates that the presently used typespecific antibodies differentiate between phylogenetically distinct groups. RNA secondary structures with minimal free energy were predicted using computer programs. Comparative sequence analysis verified the significance of certain of the predicted structural elements.",

The templates for sequencing were made by reverse transcription of astrovirus RNA with an oligo d(T) primer, and subsequent PCR on the cDNA with the oligo d(T) primer and a 5 biotinylated upstream primer (5-AAC CGT GTA ACC CTC (C/T) T, position 6 476-6 492). The nucleotide numbering used throughout this paper is adopted from the HAstV-2 sequence [4] . The PCR-product was captured on magnetic beads coated with streptavidin (Dynal, Norway), and the minus-strand eluted with NaOH according to the manufacturers' recommendations. After neutralisation the minus-strand was sequenced with a primer (5-AC CGT GTA ACC CTC CTC TC) extending three nt downstream of the upstream PCR primer. The above PCR was not successful for HAstV The following list indicates the number of novel and previously published (GenBank) sequences within each serotype used in the present analyses: HAstV-1: 3 novel samples, 2 published; HAstV-2: 3 novel samples, 1 published; HAstV-3: 3 novel samples; HAstV-4: 2 novel samples, 1 published; HAstV-5: 1 novel sample; HAstV-6: 1 novel sample, 1 published; HAstV-7: 1 novel sample; HAstV-8: 1 in GenBank. The novel samples were from independent outbreaks of diarrhoea, collected in Norway and the UK. In addition cDNA from 12 untyped astroviruses from all over the world were sequenced. The Wisconsin sequence analysis package 8.0 (Genetics Computer Group, Wisconsin, USA) was used for sequence analyses. In addition the PHYLIP 3.5 software package (J. Felsenstein, Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, USA) was used for phylogenetic analyses.",

In the rest of the sequenced part of the ORF2, however, there were substantial nucleotide and amino acid differences. This suggests a selective pressure on the level of RNA in the extreme 3end of ORF2. In the rest of the sequenced region of the capsid protein precursor, most of the amino acids were not conserved. However, Kimura corrected ratios of synonymous to nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions were above two, which suggests some conservation at the amino acid level. The distances matrices in Table 1 indicate that HAstV-3 and 7 are closely related, while the C-terminal end of the capsid protein of HAstV-4 is very different from the other serotypes. All the untyped astroviruses had sequences related to one of the known serotypes. Eight of these isolates clustered with HAstV-1, two with HAstV-2 and two, one from Ghaza and one from Uganda, with HAstV-8. These untyped isolates were included in the calculation of the intratype differences shown in Table 1 . The low intra-type RNA sequence variability and the distinct differences between the serotypes indicate that the serotypes based on reactivity to antibodies are phylogenetically distinct groups, as previously suggested [16] . However, the difference between HAstV-3 and 7 is only slightly higher than the differences within HAstV-1 which is the most prevalent serotype [11] .

Searching data bases of virus nucleic acids, we found a sequence in the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) RNA [1] with 90% identity to the first 35 nt of the conserved part of the 3-end of the HAstV genome (position 6 696-6 730). The 35 nt IBV sequence is in a conserved part of the nucleocapsid gene about 100 nt from the poly(A) tail. The two sequences are not in the same reading frame in IBV and HAstV, and the sequence is not found in other coronaviruses. This makes it unlikely that the similarities are caused by convergent evolution. Statistically, a 90% similarity to a 35 nt sequence is expected to be found once in a sequence of 10 nt.

Two distinctly different RNA secondary structures, based on RNA sequences of the 3-ends of the HAstV-1 [19] and HAstV-1 and -2 [14] genomes, have previously been predicted. The stem-loop I predicted by MFOLD, corresponded to the one suggested by Monroe et al. [14] . It included six nt of the poly(A) tail which is not included in the folding suggested by Willcocks and Carter [19] . In the stem there are four mismatched base pairs or bulges (Fig. 3 ). There is some nucleotide variation between the serotypes in these positions (Fig. 1) , but the bulges are maintained. This suggests a biological function of the bulges. Similar bulges are, for example, shown to be recognition sites for the binding of Rev and Tat to HIV RNA [2] .",
