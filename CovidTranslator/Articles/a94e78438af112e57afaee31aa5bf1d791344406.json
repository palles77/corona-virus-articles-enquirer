It would be advantageous to the drug discovery process to be able to systematically identify therapeutic areas, specific diseases or pathways in which basic scientific understanding is increasing rapidly, and in a manner that is likely to enable new interventions. This could guide the long-term investment that is necessary to build capabilities in those areas, and possibly help in recognizing near-term opportunities. Such assessments are typically made in a subjective and intuitive fashion and, although nothing can replace professional vigilance and the wisdom of experience, expert judgments might benefit from objective metrics and models 8 .

Yet, if a disease area offers no 'push' in the form of new scientific opportunities, no amount of pull will lead to new drugs -at least not mechanistically novel ones. The trend among payers and health-care providers to require such novelty suggests greater weight should be placed on push in determining investment, and it is becoming clear that even purely commercial considerations favour innovation 4 .

An obvious contributor to the development of science is public investment -as reflected, for example, in the annual budget of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), which covers internal expenditures and external grants, and therefore a large proportion of US biomedical-research funding. Another factor is the available pool of scientists, to measure which we can tally the number of doctorates awarded by US universities in biology and chemistry, as tracked by the US National Science Foundation (the National Science Foundation Science and Engineering Statistics; see Further information). Publication may be seen as an overall measure of scientific activity (BOX 1) , and this can be established by counting the number of articles retrieved from the PubMed database under various selection criteria, such as year of publication. Finally, the ultimate metric of interest is the number of novel marketed drugs, which can be assessed in terms of annual approvals of new molecular entities (NMEs) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These measures are by no means perfect (being, for example, highly United States-centric), but they have the advantage that reasonably consistent data are publicly available over many decades (FIG. 1) , whereas most other trend analyses Nature Reviews | Drug Discovery ",

It is instructive to examine these variations when considering the relationships between the measures. For example, like the rest of US government investment in science and engineering in the late 1950s, NIH funding increased sharply at this time. In the following decade there was a rapid growth in the number of doctorates awarded, which peaked sharply around 1971 and then subsided into nearly two decades of stasis. However, the period of most rapid growth in the number of Ph.D.s awarded corresponded to constant NIH budgets (adjusted for inflation), illustrating the difficulty of evaluating cause and effect among such measures. whether the increases in funding and Ph.D.s arose from the same direct stimulus, or the availability of funding influenced the awarding of Ph.D.s, it is not surprising that there should be several years' lag in the number of Ph.D.s awarded relative to funding, given the time required for a doctoral education. Such a hypothesis might account for the evident 'overshoot' in the number of Ph.D.s awarded. However, it is also possible that external confounding variables contributed to one or both trends, including factors such as inflation (reflecting the general business environment), competing spending on new government health initiatives at the time -such as Medicare and Medicaid -and even military conflict, which may have influenced graduate school enrolment and research budgets 10 .",

Again, this may be due in part to a natural time lag between these two variables. In addition, some careers may have been more attractive during the economic boom times of the 'dot-com bubble' , and others more attractive after the bubble burst. once again, it is apparent that interpreting such metrics is complicated by the likelihood of time lags in any relationship between them, as well as by the confounding effects of external events that are not directly observed; both of these phenomena are familiar in the practice of time series analysis, as performed by engineers, economists and others 11 .",

First, the smaller number of data points for FDA approvals makes it inevitable that there will be greater statistical variance in this measure than in the others observed here. If, for example, the spike in approvals in 1996 is discarded as an outlier, the general upward trend can be viewed as continuing at least until the year 2000. Second, until 2000, there were at least three decades during which NME approvals seem , which are given in the inset key. national institutes of Health (niH) funding data (green triangles) were taken from REF. 54 and adjusted for inflation. Doctorates awarded in the Us in either biology or chemistry (orange circles) were taken from REFS 55, 56. Publications data (red squares) were determined by counts of articles returned by PubMed when restricted to individual years by the standard filter function for publication date. Us Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of new molecular entities (nMEs) (blue diamonds) were determined using the Drug Approval Reports form on the Us FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research website (see Further information). The number of nME approvals was determined from the tables based on the 'new Drug Application Chemical Type' column entries. When multiple approvals of the same compound in different formulations occured in the same month, these were counted only once. We excluded technetium-based imaging reagents, for which 15 nME approvals were granted for diagnostic kits 7 . to track with the general upward trends in both public funding and publication, especially with consideration for appropriate time lags. Third, during the 1960s there was another apparent extended decline in FDA approvals, albeit with a considerably lower baseline, which preceded the sustained increase in productivity for the remainder of the century. (This is often attributed to the thalidomide tragedy which, although largely avoided in the United States, led to much stricter FDA regulations -for example, requiring demonstration of efficacy and not just safety for the first time in 1962 (REF. 13 ).) Taken together, these observations reinforce the point that short-term trends can be deceptive.",

However, for the remainder of this paper we will adopt publication rates as the best available surrogate. Publication is generally nearer to the event of actual discovery than either the funding of research or the training of scientists involved. Its growth seems to be steadier and less immediately susceptible to business cycles and other confounders than that of other variables, while still tracking reasonably closely to new drug approvals over the last half of the twentieth century, given appropriate lag times. There are enough data on publication rates to give sufficient sample sizes for statistical analysis. Perhaps most importantly, they are easily classified by topic and so can be analysed by therapeutic area or even more specific categories.

To approximate the pull of medical need and commercial potential, the world Health organization (wHo) Global burden of Disease survey 14 provides useful information. For the reference year 2002, it estimated straightforward mortality from various causes and disease burden to society, as measured by days of life lost to either premature death or disability, weighted by severity (the world Health report; see Further information). we can directly compare these surrogates for push and pull by plotting publication rates in various therapeutic areas, as determined by appropriate PubMed searches (see Supplementary information S1 (table)), against the relative disease burden associated with those therapeutic areas (that is, the burden of a disease relative to the total burden of all diseases) (FIG. 2) . we suggest that global disease burden can be primarily considered as a measure of medical need, whereas narrowing the focus to the developed world places greater emphasis on commercial potential. There is a positive correlation between global disease burden and rates of publication of scientific articles, when analysed by therapeutic areas used by the wHo (FIG. 2) (R 2 = 0.37, p < 0.01; that is, using linear regression the probability that the variables are independent of one another is less than 0.01, and the proportion of the variation in publication rate that can be accounted for by a correlation with relative disease burden is 37%). The correlation is greater in the data for the developed world (r 2 = 0.72), which differs from the global data primarily in a considerably reduced impact of infectious and parasitic diseases, respiratory infections and perinatal conditions (which include factors related to infant mortality).",

Perinatal conditions, by contrast, have low publication rates. The paucity of publications in this area might be attributable to a lack of scientific push: these conditions are closely associated with poverty (and therefore nutrition and access to basic health care) and there are few scientific mysteries surrounding their cause or cure. Publication rates may be reflective not only of push based on areas of rapid scientific advance, but also of pull based on areas most favoured by public funding and private investment. The focus on these areas is driven by medical need and commercial prospects, potentially creating positive feedback loops 15 . Public funding is based on promising and rigorously reviewed science, but is also subject to policy that is driven by medical need; this is evident in the response to the HIV epidemic. However, HIV and AIDS research funding has led to important scientific advances and has enabled new scientific opportunities 16 .",

As a set of methodologies, this field has been driven primarily by practitioners of library science and the sociology of science. The more general field of scientometrics, which uses bibliometrics as a tool to study science in terms of growth and interaction patterns, social structures, costs and other parameters, was pioneered by the historian of science Derek de Solla Price. He first called attention to the exponential growth of scientific literature, based on publication counts 47 , and went on to consider the network properties of citations among papers 48 .",

Bibliometric analyses have been used in various applications involving narrowly specified subject areas, including fields relevant to biotechnology 17 . Garfield was the first to use science citation data in a highly directed fashion, in a study that analysed the growth of the field of apoptosis research 51 . Soon after that, it was proposed that medical subject headings (MeSH) from the Medline database could be used to effectively determine the impact factors of topics, as opposed to journals or authors 52 . Bibliometrics has also been applied to patent filings, as in the work of Murray tracing the \"network of patents, papers, inventors and authors\" in the field of tissue engineering 37 , and in the work of Ducor more generally relating co-authorship and co-inventorship 3 . These studies are important forerunners of the work presented in this Analysis. Nevertheless, we think that publication is a useful indicator of trends in scientific innovation that may culminate in new drugs. when data on NME productivity are plotted against pharmaceutical r&D expenditure, there is a clear inverse correlation over the past decade. Although pharmaceutical investment is crucial for drug development and its results contribute to the scientific literature, it is reasonable to assume that commercial investment has been more heavily influenced by the pull of commercial potential than has public investment, and that both are more influenced by unmet medical need than the general scientific literature. However, there remains a substantial fraction of publications that are driven primarily by scientific novelty, whether the work has been explicitly identified as basic research or has arisen through the natural opportunism of the research process (or in the extreme case, by serendipity). It is in the character of the literature to follow the most novel and exciting scientific trends, creating an effect that resembles a chain reaction -for example, as seen with the recent upsurge in the number of papers on microrNA 17 . Moreover, pharmaceutical investment is skewed to late-stage drug development, whereas public funding and publication have a greater impact on scientific novelty related to targets and mechanisms. A 2005 study showed that, of the NMEs that were approved by the FDA from 1998 to 2003, 14% of compounds were directly attributable to university invention (and 28% to biotechnology company r&D) 7 . It is likely that an even larger proportion of target identification and validation has benefited from public research than these figures suggest and should therefore be evident in the scientific literature.",

For example, research in infectious diseases, despite starting at a high rate of publication, is currently one of the slowest growing categories, perhaps reflecting the notorious recent paucity of new antibiotic classes [18] [19] [20] . The fastest-growing category is diabetes, which has experienced a late surge in novel target opportunities, second only to oncology [21] [22] [23] . However, even for rapidly changing growth trends in publication (table) ). Part a shows overall global figures, whereas part b is restricted to the developed world, again as defined by the WHO report. The areas of the circles reflect the annual number of deaths for each cause, as a proportion of the relevant population. Circle radii are therefore scaled to the cube root of mortality rates (corresponding to the cross-section of a sphere), and standardized in each part to cardiovascular deaths, which were maximal in both cases: 16,733,160 globally and 6,333,713 in the developed world. For comparison, deaths from diabetes were 987,816 and 244,599, respectively. rates, there may be influences from newly arising medical need; for example, the rapid 5-year growth in publication rate in the area of respiratory infections in 2003 was partly due to the public-health challenges of avian and human influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SArS), and has slowly subsided 24 .",

Therefore, when the entire PubMed corpus is analysed, certain disease headings have a substantial percentage of papers in common. Specifically, 15% of disease area pairings exceed 20% overlap in articles, and several exceed this overlap considerably (see Supplementary information S2 (table)). we mitigate double counting within those pairs by various expedients (see Supplementary information S3 (table)), which generally involves either combining headings with major overlaps or subtracting counts in one category from another so as to assign the 'hit' to only one of the categories. Together, the adjustments made are sufficient to ensure that no pair of disease areas has more than 20% of articles in common.",

Using these rationalized MeSH categories to count articles published over the past 30 years shows that publications in each disease area increased continuously over 5-year periods (FIG. 3a) , with the exception of stomatognathic (oral) diseases, on which publications declined in the mid 1990s.

The other most marked change is for viral disease, the publication counts for which grew sharply in the 1980s, driven by the emergence of HIV and AIDS 31, 32 , and have since subsided noticeably. Publications on mental disorders have shown the steadiest growth over three decades, and there are upturns in publications on neurology in the late 1990s, and nutritional and metabolic disorders (which, as noted above, include diabetes) in the past decade. Certain other disease areas exhibit a nearly continuous decline in share, including urogenital, digestive, and congenital and hereditary diseases, although again it should be noted that these trends are relative to publications in other areas and not absolute trends.

The burst of publication activity in the respiratory category is attributable to SArS, avian influenza and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Note that the overlap between respiratory and viral diseases did not reach the threshold requiring separation in our rationalization of MeSH categories, so that these viral infections also occur in the respiratory category. The visualization of annual publication growth rates (FIG. 4) also makes evident a general decline across many diseases in the early 1990s, which is less apparent in the overall publication data (FIG. 1) .

For example, if an article is annotated with 'genes' or 'proteins' as major headings, it suggests that the research being reported uses a molecular biological approach that may offer specific target opportunities. Such a conclusion is also suggested by the MeSH category 'genetic techniques' , referring to the use of any of a wide range of molecular biological techniques, from cloning and sequencing to expression profiling and proteomics. The heading 'biochemical phenomena' encompasses cellular biochemistry and signal transduction, whereas 'physiological actions' includes cell physiology, electrophysiology, homeostasis and similar phenomena. In short, when present on an article with a specific disease area as a major heading, these annotations suggest that the article addresses the molecular basis of a disease and the characterization of potential targets. The heading 'pharmacological actions' suggests the availability of chemical tools or potential drugs. To present these characterizations in a fashion that allows for their comparison, we calculate the fraction of articles in each disease area with a given annotation, and then determine a z-score -that is, the number of standard deviations this fraction is from the mean value for this annotation over all disease areas (FIG. 3c) . The histogram shows that cancer has by far the most articles on genes, which is due to a preponderance of oncogenes and specific oncogenic mutations, followed by the congenital and hereditary disease category, which is driven by single-gene Mendelian disorders, and then the immune system category. The congenital and hereditary disease area is also noteworthy for its use of genetic techniques, not surprisingly, although cancer and various infectious diseases are also positive for this subcategory annotation. The immune system category and the haemic and lymphatic disease category are heavily annotated with proteins, due to the prevalence of cell surface and extracellular signalling proteins, immunoglobulins and biopharmaceutical products. As expected, biochemical phenomena and physiological processes feature prominently in the nutritional and metabolic disease area, and biochemical phenomena are also notable in cancer and congenital and hereditary diseases. other notable hits for physiological processes are neurological and mental disorders, and to a lesser extent urogenital, endocrine and cardiovascular disease. Mental disorders and cardiovascular disease areas arguably exhibit a 'pre genomic' profile: above average in physiological processes and pharmacological actions but below average in the attributes that relate to molecular targets.",

For these purposes we used an often-cited ranking of scientific journals based on traditional impact factors combined with the Google Pagerank algorithm, which takes into account the prestige of the citing journal 34 . From this list we chose the top three medical journals (The New England Journal of Medicine, The Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet) and the top three non-medical journals (Nature, Science and Cell). Searches for each disease area were restricted to these journals over the same time periods as in our previous analyses, and radar plots were used to provide multiple dimensions of the data in a visually tractable manner (FIG. 5) . In this way, variations among journals in their representation of different disease areas are immediately evident from the shapes of the polygons, and changes over time are apparent from the widths of the coloured bands. Axes are scaled such that the areas of the polygons approximate the fraction of all diseaserelated articles in each journal that are represented by that disease area.

The under-representation of infectious and neurological and psychiatric disease area publications in Cell relative to the other journals highlights two caveats to this approach: first, that the stated scopes of journals create differences in the types of submissions the journal attracts, which may vary over time (such as the historic focus of Cell on mammalian systems); and second, that major journals tend to spin off new specialty journals (such as Neuron) which may be equally competitive but more narrowly targeted, such that impact factors are lower. Indeed, many specialty journals are equally or more likely to publish groundbreaking papers, but the principle of the method we have used is to sample a restricted space at the top of the hierarchy, where the most basic scientific or medical advances are likely to be witnessed. Moreover, altering the analysis to account for these caveats would also introduce ascertainment bias, for reasons such as that most of the journals in question have not existed for the 30-year time span sampled.",

This may be appropriate in assessing major organizational commitments to invest in therapeutic areas, but a more frequent need would be to examine specific diseases or other more finegrained divisions of therapeutic areas for their current level of scientific activity. A narrower focus, whether by time, category or filters of any kind (such as for papers with genes as major topics), will reduce article counts and statistical power. This has the disadvantage of producing a more variable readout that requires careful assessment, but has the great advantage of removing any averaging effect of large categories and allowing small but important signals to emerge. Subdividing disease areas is also more likely to avoid the effects of institutional inertia discussed above, as redirection of resources and attention within a broad research area, which can be detected by examining disease subcategories, is easier than changing career directions and editorial remits to entirely new fields.",

This included US, European and World Intellectual Property Organization filings with a primary or secondary classification code that suggested relevance to drug discovery (namely, A61K, A61P, C01, C07, C08, C12N, C12P and C12Q). 134,887 articles that were published in 2002-2006 were mapped to individual patents based on matching subsets of author names. Patent matches to publications were scored by summing the inverse author frequency -which is inversely proportional to the number of patents on which a given author is named as an inventor -of all matching authors on a patent and a publication. The score threshold for a match was reached when at least two authors (with no more than 10 patents each) were named on both the patent and the publication. The publication had to be no longer than 3 years after, and not before, the patent filing year. A sampling of the resulting matches was curated. We estimated ~75% precision, assessed solely on the correspondence of the titles of patents and publications. Although this cannot accurately associate a specific patent with a publication, we think it provides a reasonable sampling across a disease area. Similar patent to publication matching algorithms have been used previously 37 . (FIG. 7b) . we focus on genes that show growth in publication rates. As might be expected, we find more variability in trends for genes than for disease subcategories, reflected in wider dispersion from the diagonal. So, publications that mention forkhead box P3 (FoXP3) in their abstract have continuously increased in number, reflecting the recent appreciation of the role of this transcription factor in the control of the regulatory T cell lineage in mice 38 . Publications that mention janus kinase 2 (JAK2) exhibit a recent burst in publication rate beyond their consistent medium-term growth, which probably results from the discovery of a variant of this well studied gene that is prevalent in chronic myeloproliferative disorders 39 . by contrast, ADIPOQ (adiponectin, C1Q and collagen domain-containing) was only characterized shortly before the medium-term time frame of our analysis. It exhibits strong early publication growth when associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease 40 a growth that has slackened in the near-term time frame. It is also possible to identify pathways that are associated with the most productive publication record, by taking all publications associated with genes that have shown growth in publication rates in the past 2 years (p < 0.001), and mapping them onto manually curated pathways derived from various sources (such as bioCarta). we restrict our attention to those pathways with 10-100 associated genes and identify the genes in each pathway that exhibit strong publication growth. we use a two-tailed Fisher's Exact test to determine which pathways are enriched with such genes to an extent beyond chance expectation. The top pathways, in order of decreasing significance, are toll-like receptor signalling (8 out of 42 genes with significant publication growth), tumour necrosis factor receptor 2 signalling (8 out of 46 genes), interleukin-22 soluble receptor signalling (9 out of 80 genes) and dendritic cells in regulating T helper type 1 (T H 1) and T H 2 development (5 out of 22 genes) (see Supplementary information S5 (table) ).",

Coronavirus infections (mostly due to severe acute respiratory syndrome) were off the scale, with 84% annualized growth on the 5-year axis but 36% annual decline over the past 2 years. b | Changes in publication rates concerning genes that achieve statistical significance (out of 13,024). Only genes with over 100 identifiable publications in 2006-2007 are shown. The overall analysis may be biased toward genes with more established and consistent nomenclature, as it was necessary to scan abstracts for gene symbols and known synonyms to derive this data.

The fundamental question remains the validity of scientific publication as a metric of innovation. As noted at the beginning of this Analysis, the push for drug discovery comprises a complex of interdependent factors that contribute to the advance of science, and interact in feedback loops with the pull of unmet medical need and commercial potential. between these and the end product of proven novel therapies, which necessarily lag behind the initial scientific discoveries by a number of years, the publication record, which is more amenable to detailed analysis, could constitute a fitting surrogate for innovation.",

Some years before the development of recent novel drugs, one might expect to see flurries of publications relating to their targets or pathways. However, advances in the use of genomic technologies for target discovery will have been a factor only in the development of more recent drugs, introducing a potential bias into analyses of this field. Moreover, even some recent drugs did not originate from the identification of a molecular target. For example, although the first thiazolidinedione was marketed in 1997 for type 2 diabetes, peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-\u03b3 was only recognized as its target 2 years before that, when the drug class had long been in development 43 . The trend towards repurposing drugs means that a burst of new research in a disease area may lead to the novel application of a drug long after it is first marketed -for example, the recent interest in thalidomide for its immunomodulatory properties that has produced a sharp increase in publication after decades of dormancy 44 .",

For the identification of new therapeutic opportunities, we are currently investigating the predictive power of bibliometric data combined with various other data sources, such as industry pipeline activity. others have used sophisticated literature-mining and natural language processing techniques that could extract a more detailed knowledge than that afforded by the MeSH annotation we have primarily employed 29 .
