Banding patterns obtained from equilibrium centrifugations in CsC1 supported the EM identification. Densities associated with the identified particles were : 1.34 g/ml for astrovirus, 1.39 g/ml for \"full\" parvovirus, and 1.24--1.26 g/ml for \"typical\" coronavirus. Convalescent sera from the pups aggregated these three particle types as observed by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM). Only coronavirus-like particles were later detected in formed stools from these same pups. Coronavirus and parvo-likc viruses arc recognized agents of canine viral enteritis, however, astrovirus has not been previously reported in dogs.",
