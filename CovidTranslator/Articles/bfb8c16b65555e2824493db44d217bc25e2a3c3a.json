            "text": "Viral genomes tend to be quite compact but have evolved to maximize their information content. One solution to the limited coding capacities of RNA viruses is to combine multiple functions into single proteins. The different functions of these viral proteins may require them to interact with multiple viral RNA sequences and/or viral and host proteins (Bedard and Semler, 2004; Daijogo and Semler, 2011; Sola et al., 2011; Steil and Barton, 2009; Yin et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2013) . In general, it is thought that not all functions occur simultaneously and that ligand binding to one active/binding site may shut down the other. How this communication occurs is not known.",

            "text": "The picornavirus 3C protein is a great model system for understanding the regulation of multiple functions in a viral protein. The 3C protein can also be found as a domain within the 3CD and 3BCD polyproteins (Cameron et al., 2010) . The 3C(D) protein is the major protease responsible for most of the polyprotein cleavage events (Cameron et al., 2010; Jore et al., 1988; Parsley et al., 1999; Ypma-Wong et al., 1988) and is also important for regulating the host cell's response through cleavage of critical host cell proteins (Chase et al., 2014; de Breyne et al., 2008; Kuyumcu-Martinez et al., 2004; Rozovics et al., 2012; Walker et al., 2013; Yalamanchili et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2013) . The 3C protein and/or its precursors also interact with cis-acting replication elements (CREs) located within the viral genome (Steil and Barton, 2009) . Interactions with these RNA structures are important for regulating replication and translation events (Blair et al., 1998; Franco et al., 2005; Gamarnik and Andino, 1998; Nayak et al., 2006; Parsley et al., 1997; Shih et al., 2004; Walker et al., 1995; Yang et al., 2004) . It is not completely clear if the two functions (i.e., protease and RNA binding) of 3C are interrelated. In Norovirus (NV) 3C-like protease, RNA binding was found to impair the protease catalytic rate (Viswanathan et al., 2013) , but similar studies have not been done with picornaviral 3C proteins. However, amino acid changes at the RNA binding site of Enterovirus 71 (EV71) 3C decreased the protease activity, but amino acid changes at the protease active site had little impact on RNA binding (Shih et al., 2004) . The protease activity of the HRV 14 3C was likewise affected by amino acid changes at the RNA-binding site (Walker et al., 1995) .",

Regulation of the two functions of 3C through binding of the other ligand may be important in the virus infection cycle. In this article, we indeed demonstrate that RNA and peptide binding alter proteolytic activity and RNA binding, respectively. We also identify millisecond conformational exchange events by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) R 2 relaxation dispersion experiments near the protease active site that are modulated by RNA binding. These findings suggest that RNA and peptide binding selects different subsets of 3C conformations, thereby regulating subsequent 3C activities.",

These studies and others (Shih et al., 2004; Walker et al., 1995) suggested that the two functions of 3C may be interrelated. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the protease activity and RNA-binding functions of PV 3C in the presence of the other ligand. In our studies, we used two versions of 3C: proteolytically active (3C active ) and proteolytically inactive (3C inactive ) protein in which the active site cysteine has been changed to an alanine, and the remaining cysteine has been changed to a serine (i.e., 3C inactive has the substitutions C147A and C153S). Besides the protease activity, we do not expect significant functional and/ or structural dynamic differences between 3C active and 3C inactive . The C153S substitution is on the surface of the protein and not near either the protease active site or the predicted RNA-binding site. For RNA binding, we used either the oriI (origin of replication Internal) RNA or the stem left (SL) region of the oriI RNA ( Figure 1 ). For the peptide, we used either the CA peptide, which corresponds to the cleavage site between 2C and 3A of the polyprotein, or the AB peptide, which corresponds to the cleavage site between 2A and 2B of the viral polyprotein ( Figure 1) .",

As such, we used fluorescence polarization experiments to monitor RNA binding, which is labeled with fluorescein on the 3 0 end, to 3C inactive in the absence and presence of peptide. For these experiments, we monitored binding of SL RNA and oriI RNA in the presence/absence of CA and AB peptides ( Figure 1 ). Again, we performed a series of experiments with different concentrations of CA and AB peptides allowing us to perform ANOVA and Tukey HSD statistical tests. The presence of the CA peptide did not significantly alter the dissociation constant (K d ) associated with SL RNA binding (Table 2; ANOVA p value $0.61) but led to a small decrease in the oriI K d (ANOVA p value $0.02). In contrast, the presence of the AB peptide resulted in more substantial changes in both SL and oriI RNA binding ( Table 2 ). The presence of the AB peptide led to a decrease in SL RNA-binding affinity (ANOVA p value $0.0001) but an increase in oriI RNA-binding affinity (ANOVA p value $ 0.0006; HSD p value for the largest peptide concentration $0.0005). These results suggest that the effect of peptide binding on RNA affinity is peptide-sequence dependent, and these effects are also dependent on the sequence/structure of the RNA itself.",

            "text": "Our studies indicated that RNA and peptide binding modulate the protease and RNA-binding activities of PV 3C, respectively. To gain more insight into the regulation of these two functions, we characterized these interactions through NMR methodology. The interpretation of our solution-state NMR experiments on PV 3C is dependent on the oligomeric state of the protein. According to dynamic light scattering (DLS) and NMR analyses, 3C active and 3C inactive are both monomeric in solution. The theoretical translation diffusion coefficients for monomeric and dimeric 3C are 9.9 3 10 \u00c011 m 2 /s and 7.5 3 10 \u00c011 m 2 /s, respectively (Amero et al., 2008) . The translational diffusion coefficient for 3C inactive was estimated to be 9.6 3 10 \u00c011 m 2 /s by NMR and 9.3 3 10 \u00c011 m 2 /s by DLS. Similarly, the translational diffusion coefficient for 3C active was estimated to be 9.9 3 10 \u00c011 m 2 /s by NMR and 9.4 3 10 \u00c011 m 2 /s by DLS. Addition of the reducing agent b-mercaptoethanol to 3C active (which has two Cys residues) did not substantially change the measured translational diffusion coefficients (9.7 3 10 \u00c011 m 2 /s by NMR and 9.3 3 10 \u00c011 m 2 /s by DLS). These results are consistent with previous NMR studies (Amero et al., 2008) and in contrast to the finding that PV 3C crystallizes as a dimer (Mosimann et al., 1997) . These results are reminiscent of previous findings where NV 3C-like protease was found to be a dimer in the X-ray crystal structure (Zeitler et al., 2006) but a monomer in the NMR solution-state structure (Takahashi et al., 2013) .",

The stem left (SL) RNA that is used in these studies corresponds to the nucleotide sequence shown in blue. (C) 3C catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in the viral polyprotein, including between 2C and 3A, and 2A and 2B. These cleavage sites are represented by the CA and AB peptides, respectively. The two C-terminal Arg residues (underlined) are added to the peptide to increase solubility, but they are not predicted to interact with 3C. See also Figure S1 . (Amero et al., 2008) . We identified resonances with appreciable chemical shift changes as those showing chemical shift changes at least one SD above the average chemical shift change across all resonances. Appreciable chemical shift changes induced by SL RNA binding are associated with amino acid residues in two clusters ( Figure 2A ). One cluster is close by the KFRDI motif, which was identified by previous NMR experiments (Amero et al., 2008; Claridge et al., 2009 ) and mutational studies (Andino et al., 1993; Blair et al., 1998; Hammerle et al., 1992; Leong et al., 1993; Nayak et al., 2006; Shih et al., 2004; Walker et al., 1995) as being important for RNA binding. This cluster included residues 81-89 on the h3 helix, residues on the N-terminal h1 helix (adjacent to h3), residues 29-32 on the b2 strand (nearby h3), and residues 156 and 157 on the b11 strand (nearby h3). It should also be noted that upon binding SL RNA, some residues on the h3 helix showed two resonances (Figure 3 ; e.g., Asp85 and His89), which is consistent with conformational exchange on the slow NMR timescale. This effect is not due to the use of subsaturating concentrations of RNA; under these conditions, we expect that 99.6% of 3C is bound with SL RNA (based on K d of 0.76 mM; see Table 2 ). The other cluster of residues show small chemical shift changes and correspond to residues nearby the protease active site, including Asn165 and Phe170 on the C-terminal side and His40 and Glu63 on the N-terminal side of the center cleft between the two b barrel subdomains. These findings are similar to those for HRV-14 3C, which also suggested that structural changes around the protease active site were induced upon binding RNA (Claridge et al., 2009) .",

These findings are intriguing considering that we have shown that RNA/peptide binding can affect the interactions of 3C with the other ligand (i.e., peptide/RNA; Tables 1 and 2). To gain more insight into these potential cooperative effects, we formed the binary complexes with either RNA or peptide and then titrated in peptide or RNA, respectively. Remarkably, some of the resonances associated with these ternary complexes were at different chemical shift positions than that observed for either of the binary complexes (including catalytic residues His40 and Glu71) (Figure 3A) . In fact, many of these residues were associated with two resonances, again suggestive of conformational exchange on the slow NMR timescale. Perhaps even more remarkable was the finding that the chemical shift positions of these resonances depended on whether SL RNA or CA peptide was added first ( Figure 3B ). Many of the residues associated with multiple resonances in the ternary complexes ( Figure 3C ) are near the 3C dimer interface as observed by crystallographic studies (Mosimann et al., 1997) and/or near interfaces proposed to be important for interacting with other PV proteins (Shen et al., 2008) .",

One parameter that can be gleaned from the R 2 relaxation dispersion experiments is R ex , which is the contribution to R 2 from conformational exchange and indicates those regions of the protein undergoing conformational exchange on the microto millisecond timescale. For 3C without ligand, the resonances with substantial R ex (i.e., >5 s \u00c01 ) are associated with residues at the center cleft near the protease active site and residues near the N-terminal h1 helix (Figures 4B and S3) . The corresponding amino acid residues include Tyr6, Asn14, and Ile15 on the N-terminal h1 helix, Phe25 on the b2 strand adjacent to the N-terminal h1 helix, Asn105 on the loop adjacent to the h1 helix, Lys175, Phe179, and Gln181 on the h4 helix of the C terminus, Leu37 and residues 60-75 on the N-terminal b barrel subdomain, and Gln122, Gly123, Ala133, Met160, Ala171, and Ala172 on the C-terminal b barrel subdomain. Similar patterns of conformational exchange were observed when 3C inactive was bound with SL RNA, although there were a few additional regions that showed conformational exchange (including residues 13, 100-103, 108, 116, 150, and 162). (B) The NMR spectra of the ternary complex bound with peptide and SL RNA also depends on the order of ligand binding. The resonances are colored purple and cyan for when SL RNA and CA peptide are added first, respectively. (C) Locations of residues associated with two or more resonances in the ternary complexes bound with peptide and RNA are shown as magenta colored spheres. NMR spectra were collected at 298 K with $215 mM 3C inactive in the presence/absence of 215 mM SL RNA or 215 mM CA peptide using a buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 50 mM NaCl.

            "text": "Data from the R 2 relaxation dispersion experiments can also give more quantitative information about the kinetics and thermodynamics of conformational exchange. Assuming conformational exchange between two conformations (say conformations A and B), R 2 relaxation dispersion experiments can yield the exchange rate constant k ex that is the sum of the forward (k A/B ) and reverse (k B/A ) rate constants, the populations of the exchange conformations (p A , p B ), and the dynamic chemical shift difference between the exchanging conformations (Du = du A \u00c0 du B ) (Loria et al., 1999) . Generally, experimental data for different residues are fit with global k ex and p A /p B values, and residue-specific Du values. The global k ex and p B values for 3C inactive without RNA (k ex = 480 \u00b1 22 s \u00c01 , p b = 0.020 \u00b1 0.001) and with SL RNA (k ex = 518 \u00b1 19 s \u00c01 , p B = 0.023 \u00b1 0.001) were very similar. It should be noted that residues undergoing conformational exchange are generally not those that show substantial chemical shift perturbations upon binding SL RNA (Figure 2A ; Table S1 ), so comparisons of Du values can give some insight into how the binding of SL RNA affects the nature of the higher energy protein conformation ( Figure 4D ). Many of the Du values correlate between the apo and RNA-bound states, however, there are a group of residues in which the Du values for the SL RNA binary complex are substantially higher than the Du values for 3C inactive without RNA. These residues tend to be spatially close to the protease active site (Figure 4C ; residues shown in blue). Many of these residues, or residues nearby, show two or more resonances in the RNA/peptide ternary complexes (Figure 3 ). It is also interesting that SL RNA binding increased k cat by a similar amount ($1.2-fold) as it increased the back rate constant for the R 2 relaxation dispersion experiments (k B/A = 9.6 s \u00c01 and 11.9 s \u00c01 for without and with SL RNA, respectively). Altogether, these results suggest that binding of SL RNA selects for a different subset of 3C conformations, and these conformations may interact with peptides at the active site differently than 3C without RNA.",

The N-terminal residues 1-13 revealed the largest deviations with per-RMSD values in the range 2.7-14.1 \u00c5 . Most of the 3C residues, 75% of the total residues, exhibited per-RMSD values lower than 1.6 \u00c5 .

Some residues were associated with multiple resonances when RNA/peptide was bound, suggesting conformational exchange on the slow NMR timescale ( Figure 3) . Intriguingly, many of these residues had different chemical shift positions depending on the order of RNA/peptide binding (Figure 3 ). RNA binding also induced changes in the pico-to nanosecond ( Figure S4 ) and micro-to millisecond timescale dynamics of 3C inactive (Figure 4) . With RNA bound, residues around the protease active site fluctuated into a different conformation, as assessed by the R 2 relaxation dispersion studies (Figure 4) . The higher energy conformation might be important for interacting with protein substrates, according to a conformational selection mechanism (Boehr et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2000; Miller and Dill, 1997; Tsai et al., 1999) . These results suggest that binding of RNA (peptide) selects a different subset of conformations, which then affects how peptide (RNA) will subsequently interact with 3C ( Figure 6 ). In fact, peptide binding influences RNA affinity (Table 2 ) and RNA affects proteolytic activity ( Table 1) .",

The AB peptide is representative of the cleavage sites within the P2 domain of the polyprotein. The P2 proteins are important for host-protein interactions (2A) and generation of vesicles and replication organelles (2B and 2BC) (Gradi et al., 1998; Rust et al., 2001; Trahey et al., 2012; Ventoso et al., 1998) . The CA peptide is representative of the cleavage site that releases P3 proteins from P2 proteins; P3 proteins are most notable for their roles in genome replication and post-translational processing (Cameron et al., 2010) . These findings suggest that many of the P2 and P3 protein functions are separated temporally, and so their proteolytic release by 3C(D) may be regulated differentially by RNA interactions.",

Other residues are important in forming higher order complexes with other viral proteins. For example, a structural model involving a 3C dimer and a 3D monomer binding to oriI RNA has been proposed to be important for initiation of RNA synthesis (Shen et al., 2008) . Many of the 3C residues that form intersubunit interactions within this complex are conformationally dynamic on the millisecond timescale, as shown either by the R 2 relaxation dispersion experiments (Figure 4) or by the presence of multiple resonances in the ternary complexes (Figure 3) , including residues important for 3C-3D interactions such as Phe25, Lys108, and Asn165 and residues important for 3C-3C interactions such as Lys60, Ala61, and Asn69.

            "text": "It should also be kept in mind that the 3C protein can be found as part of the 3BCD and 3CD polyproteins. The 3BC(D) protein may be involved in initiation of genome replication; 3CD is thought to be the major protease and the major CRE-binding protein (Cameron et al., 2010) . In fact, 3CD generally has higher proteolytic activity and different protease specificity compared with 3C (Parsley et al., 1999; Ypma-Wong et al., 1988) . However, the reasons for these differences are unclear. The crystal structure of 3CD appears simply to be a composite of the 3C and 3D domains with no additional protein interactions that may help to explain these functional differences (Marcotte et al., 2007) . The covalent attachment of the 3D domain to the C terminus of 3C may alter the internal motions of 3C to influence RNA-binding ability and protease activity. The ability to fit the R 2 relaxation dispersion data to global kinetic and thermodynamic parameters suggests that the millisecond motions in 3C are concerted, and so changes in the N and C termini would likely lead to dynamic changes elsewhere in the protein, especially at the active site and RNA-binding site. It has been previously proposed that dynamic fluctuations may be responsible for functional differences between 3C and 3CD (Cameron et al., 2009) . Dynamic regions in 3C may be involved in other biomolecular interactions; targeted studies of these dynamic regions may reveal novel biomolecular interactions important in regulating the multifunctional roles of 3C in viral infection.",

The 3C monomer (chain A) of the crystal structure PDB: 1L1N was used as the initial coordinates for the simulation. The 3C molecule was immersed in a truncated octahedron solvent box filled with TIP3P water molecules; the distance between any protein atom and the edge of the solvent box was kept at 20 \u00c5 . The charge of the simulated structure was neutralized by adding the appropriate number of counter ions. The all-atom NPT simulation was carried out at 300 K, and the Berndsen thermostat was used to control the temperature during simulation. The total simulation time was 100 ns using a 1 fs integration time step; any bonds involving H atoms were constrained using the Shake algorithm. The non-bonded interactions were calculated under periodic boundary conditions using a cutoff distance of 9 \u00c5 ; the electrostatic interactions were calculated using particle mesh Ewald method. Analysis of the MD trajectory was done as described previously (Moustafa et al., 2011) , utilizing the last 50 ns of the trajectory using Ptraj and Cpptraj of the AMBER package (Roe and Cheatham, 2013) .

NMR chemical shift perturbations were calculated using the equation Dd combined = (Dd H 2 + (Dd N /5) 2 ) 1/2 where Dd H and Dd N are the chemical shift differences between 3C with and without the appropriate ligand for the backbone amide proton and nitrogen, respectively.

Residues that show substantial chemical shift pertubations for both SL RNA and peptide binding are shown in purple.
