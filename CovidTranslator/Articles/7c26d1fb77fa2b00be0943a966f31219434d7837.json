Recent studies have identified a new species of HRV called HRVC (17) (18) (19) (20) . These novel HRV are associated with wheezing and asthma (15, 21) , but their role in immuncompromised children is not clear.

Children evaluated as inpatients and outpatients in the Hematology-Oncology department for any underlying hematologyoncology problem and/or HSCT who presented with acute respiratory symptoms were eligible. Nasal washes were collected from children with either \u22651 upper respiratory symptom accompanied by a temperature >38.4\u00b0C, or \u22651 lower respiratory sign or symptom with or without fever. During sick visits, subjects' signs and symptoms were recorded on a standardized clinical form that documented the following symptoms: cough, wheezing, fever, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, red eyes, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, hoarseness and myalgia. Subjects or parents were asked about sick contacts at home and daycare or school attendance.",

This emphasizes the importance of using sensitive molecular techniques to detect viral etiologic agents in this high-risk population. In addition, real-time RT-PCR permitted detection of some viruses rarely identified by conventional methods, such as HRV and MPV. National proficiency testing surveys performed by the College of American Pathologists in 2013 suggests that ~200 hospital laboratories use molecular methods for respiratory virus testing (unpublished data; www.cap.org). Of these laboratories, slightly more than half use multiplex assays, while the rest use limited assays that do not detect HRV or MPV.

A retrospective Korean study reported PIV as the most common virus, followed by RSV (33); however, that study used conventional methods including culture and DFA, which rarely detect HRV and MPV (15, 24) . The study only identified a virus in 6% of patients, likely due to insensitive methods, and no HRV were detected. A retrospective study in Boston included conventional testing, and PCR only if ordered by the clinician; the study reported only RSV, adenovirus, influenza, and PIV, and included only virus-positive episodes, so incidence was not calculated (34) . One prospective study compared multiplex PCR with conventional testing in a pediatric population; interestingly, that study also found HRV to be the most common virus at 63% (35) . That study did not genotype or speciate HRV specimens. As in our study, HRV infection was associated with LRI as well as URI. Only one report included genotyping of HRV in HSCT recipients, and that study included only adults; HRV was detected in 8% of 229 episodes of ARI, and 39% of virus-positive illnesses; our study identified HRV in 19% of all illnesses, and 48% of the virus-positive specimens. In this Australian cohort, HRVC was the most common species and was associated with both URI and LRI (36) .",

In our study, none of the measured factors was statistically significantly associated with respiratory viral infection; of note, the detection of a virus in the subjects may have reflected medically significant respiratory disease leading to testing rather than differences in exposure to viruses. In addition, subjects without a virus detected may have had heterogeneous etiologies (e.g. allergic, bacterial, or fungal). The inability to identify significant associations may be due to the small number of subjects; alternatively, this entire population may be at risk for medically significant respiratory virus infections. In support of this, other similar studies failed to identify clinical and demographic risk factors except for the presence of LRI at presentation (33, 34, 41) .",

We detected relatively few infections with each individual virus. We did not test for all known respiratory viruses; however, we did test for the eight most common pediatric respiratory viruses using sensitive individual real-time RT-PCR. We did not include asymptomatic controls; literature is conflicting on how common asymptomatic infection is in the HSCT population (9, 40, 41) . It is possible that the HRV we detected was not the causative pathogen of the clinical illness; however, we excluded other viruses by RT-PCR.
