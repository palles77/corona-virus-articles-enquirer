Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (p<0.0001) was negatively associated, and adequate PCV-7 immunization status (p=0.001) appeared to increase the risk of ABS. Girls had more ABS episodes than boys (0.5\u00b10.8 vs 0.3\u00b10.6 episodes/year, respectively, p=0.03). Viruses were detected in 63% during the initial URI visit; rhinovirus detection was positively correlated with ABS risk (p=0.01). Bacterial cultures were positive in 82/83 (99%) available samples obtained at the initial URI visit; polymicrobial (56%), Moraxella catarrhalis (20%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%) were the most common cultures.

The study was approved by the UTMB Institutional Review Board; written informed consent was obtained for all subjects. The study was designed to capture all viral URI episodes that occurred during a one-year follow-up period in each child, in order to study the clinical characteristics and complications of URI. Subjects with chronic medical conditions or with anatomic/physiologic defects of the ear/nasopharynx were excluded. Demographic and AOM risk factors information were collected at enrollment. Parents were asked to report to the study personnel as soon as the child began to have URI/AOM symptoms (nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, fever, ear pain/tugging). Children were seen shortly after the onset of URI and then examined again in a few days later (e.g. days 3-7 of URI onset). At each visit, parents were asked about current symptoms, medications, and history of viral illness exposure. Evaluation included physical examination, pneumatic otoscopy and tympanometry. Each URI episode was monitored closely for at least 3 weeks for any development of complications, such as AOM or ABS. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and secretions were collected for bacterial and viral studies during the initial URI visit (median day=4 of URI onset) and when AOM was diagnosed. Parents were contacted bi-weekly for information about URI symptoms and the occurrence of any URI/AOM episodes since the last contact. In addition, we reviewed and extracted pertinent data from each child's electronic medical records after subjects had completed the study. Since the UTMB is the sole pediatric care provider on Galveston Island, it allowed the capture of all clinical diagnoses and management of URI complications in our study patients.",

Diagnosis was made by the study physicians in 83 ABS episodes; another 33 ABS diagnoses were made by other primary care physicians. The study physicians consisted of 2 board-certified pediatric infectious disease specialists (JP, TC) and a board-certified general pediatrician (KR) who used the clinical criteria available during the study period, per the 2001 guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (9) . ABS was defined as either: 1) acute/ severe, when symptoms had been severe or abrupt, and included concurrent temperature \u2265 102\u00b0F (39\u00b0C) and purulent rhinorrhea in an ill-looking child within 3 days of URI onset; 2) persistent, when URI symptoms had lasted for >10 days without clinical improvement; or 3) biphasic, when URI symptoms had worsened after an initial improvement. In each case, the study physician diagnosed ABS based on patient's history and clinical findings only. No imaging studies or laboratory tests were performed. We reviewed the clinical data from 116 ABS episodes to reaffirm the diagnosis. Of these, 13 ABS episodes (not diagnosed by the study physicians) were considered to be questionable/unlikely or less likely after thoroughly reviewing the medical records; hence, these episodes were excluded. Consequently, 103 ABS complicating URI episodes are included in this report. Patients were treated with antibiotics according to the standard of care. None had experienced intra-or extra-cranial complications.",

The gender effect on ABS may be partially explained by the fact that more boys may have received antibiotic treatment for AOM earlier in the course of URI, and this may have prevented ABS from developing later in the URI course. Other explanations for gender difference derive from gender-based anatomical variations and/or mucociliary function. In young children, only the maxillary sinus and part of the ethmoidal cells are aerated sufficiently enough to make room for a clinically recognizable infectious process. By using a 3-dimensional reconstruction of computed tomography images, it has been demonstrated that the maxillary sinus volume in females <10 years is smaller when compared to age-matched males (14) . Therefore, the smaller maxillary sinus and its opening (the osteomeatal complex, which also drains the anterior ethmoidal cells) tends to be blocked more often in girls, thus allowing the development of viral sinusitis and subsequently ABS due to ineffective mucociliary clearance (15) . In any event, our gender finding is consistent with the national data in adults, showing that ABS rates in women are almost two-fold higher than in men (16) .",

Bacteriologic study of ABS in children by maxillary sinus aspirations was last reported several decades ago (25) , prior to the use of PCV-7.

As M. catarrhalis is less pathogenic than S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, it is possible that children colonized with more pathogenic bacteria may have developed AOM early on and treated with antibiotic. We have reported high incidence of AOM (37%) in this cohort (7) . Further studies are required to determine whether M. catarrhalis has a predilection towards sinus cavities. We also found positive correlation between age-appropriate PCV-7 immunization status and development of ABS. The reason for this is unclear. PCV-7 targeted the most pathogenic serotypes of S. pneumoniae; immunized children may have increased carriage rate of less pathogenic bacteria, including other S. pneumoniae serotypes, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. This, in turn, may have spared them from having AOM and receiving antibiotic treatment earlier in the course of viral URI. In any event, it is still controversial whether reduction of S. pneumoniae colonization by PCV-7 immunization increased NP colonization of other pathogens. While NP isolation rates of H. influenzae in children with acute maxillary sinusitis has increased by 8% in the post-PCV-7 years in one study (27) , other reports did not find significant shifts in other non-S. pneumoniae NP pathogens (28, 29) . Further studies are required to monitor the effect of new vaccines on incidence of common bacterial disease such as AOM and ABS.",

While each one of the nasopharyngeal bacterial pathogens could have caused ABS without a concurrent virus, we found 3 URI episodes associated with rhinovirus complicated by ABS when there were no NP colonizing bacteria at the time of URI. Our findings suggest that rhinovirus alone may cause severe symptoms in young children, thus leading to ABS diagnosis. Yet, rhinovirus RNA shedding can persist up to 5-6 weeks after the onset of symptomatic URI (30) . Therefore, the correlation between the presence of rhinovirus and subsequent ABS development needs to be interpreted with caution.",
