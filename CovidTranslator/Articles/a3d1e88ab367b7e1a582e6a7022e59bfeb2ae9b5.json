We have previously argued that developing countries can harness human genetic variation to benefit their populations and economies. Based on our empirical studies of large-scale population genotyping projects in Mexico, India and Thailand, we describe how these resources are being adopted to improve public health and create knowledge-based economies. A significant additional benefit is building the capacity for scientific research and internalizing advances in technology, whatever their source.

The question this raises is who will live in that house? Will it be only those lucky few in the industrialized economies, or will all people be able to find a room, no matter where they come from? The use of genomic information to develop therapeutics is growing in industrialized countries 2 . In the developing world, however, advances in genomics are perceived to be out of reach; critics question why countries would invest in genomic research when they face other more pressing health needs such as poverty, infectious diseases and the lack of basic infrastructure. In addition, the high cost that is associated with genomic research and the inadequacy of existing regulatory and intellectual property regimes are seen as significant obstacles 3 . We too have argued that developing countries are the ones that can least afford to waste their limited health resources on ineffective diagnostics and therapies 4, 5 .",

But infectious diseases are not the only major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries; the rates of non-communicable disease are also increasing 11 . Currently, one-third of all deaths in the world are caused by cardiovascular diseases. Of these, nearly 80% occur in developing nations. By the year 2020, the number of new cancer cases will increase by a staggering 73% in developing countries as opposed to only 29% in developed countries 12 . Wanting to assess the resources that the developing countries already possess to improve public health we chose to focus our case studies on large-scale genotyping initiatives in human populations, which stand to address both infectious diseases (host response) as well as chronic diseases through a better understanding of the correlations between genotype and phenotype. Investing in this field, identifying niche areas within it and within areas of local interest, and building life sciences-based capacity around such knowledge in developing countries might not only contribute to improving local health but also potentially stimulate economic development. At the very least, such approaches will help understand disease susceptibility and drug responses in the local population 13 .",

The concept of genomic sovereignty that we describe in this article is linked to the wish of the three countries described here -Mexico, India and Thailand -to capture the value of their investments in these large-scale genotyping projects.

Using previously described methods (BOX 1), we conducted 56 in-depth interviews to develop case studies of the Mexican National Genomic Medicine Institute (INMEGEN) (BOX 2) , the Indian Genome Variation database Consortium (IGVdb Consortium) (BOX 3) and two smaller initiatives in Thailand, the Thailand SNP Discovery Project, and the Pharmacogenomics Project at the Thailand Centre for Excellence in Life Sciences (TCELS) (BOX 4) . We explored the motivations for undertaking these largescale genotyping initiatives, the adoption of genomic medicine in each country, the mechanisms that the three countries are envisioning or implementing to develop genomic medicine appropriate to their own circumstances, and the potential ethical, legal, social and cultural issues that have arisen or might arise as a result. Here, we define genomic medicine as health applications derived from genomic approaches and research, manifested, amongst others, in both boutique personalized medicine and population or sub-population level pharmacogenomics and theragnostics 17, 18 .",

In this context, the definition of success will probably pose a challenge as the initiatives in Mexico, Thailand and India are seeking continued political support, and healthy scepticism is called for. With this narrow understanding of the potential of genomics, the criticism is indeed valid, and we did encounter sceptic voices; for example, some key informants worried that INMEGEN is superfluous and expensive to maintain. However, if we consider genomics more widely, especially including its capacity to improve public health, the picture is different. For example, we are much better able to track SARS now that we have its genomic sequence than when the disease surfaced just a few years ago. Nevertheless, the genotyping initiatives discussed here",

In addition, the institute promoted understanding of the Mexican HapMap project through radio appearances and publications for the general public. Similarly, TCELS, in conjunction with local scientists, is preparing a book on 'Pharmacogenomics for layman' to be released in june 2008. Each of these initiatives is publicly funded, hence their dependence upon public support. Investing in public engagement programmes will help raise the level of understanding of the public, possibly increasing the likelihood of public support. However, in Mexico and Thailand, some key informants told us that local critics consider some of the genomics public engagement activities as propaganda. Although public understanding will ensure public demand of genomic products and services, and encourage physicians to implement genomic medicine in their practice, genomics institutes will have to strike a balance between public relation activities and proper public engagement activities to avoid hype. Despite this concern, increased public understanding of genomics can ensure that the public have realistic expectations as to the benefits associated with genomic medicine as well as the length of time it will take to reap these benefits.",

An early example from 1997 is Shantha Biotechnics Private, a spin-out company from the Osmania University in Hyderabad, India, that leveraged its patented innovative manufacturing process in the Pichia pastoris expression system to produce a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine 14 . As a result, they were subsequently able to drive down the cost of the hepatitis B vaccine within India 14 . Although this example is specific to health biotechnology, the model is also applicable to genomic medicine. Given the criticisms of the inadequacy of intellectual property protection systems in developing countries, we decided to focus on how each of these initiatives chose to approach this challenge. Mechanisms for intellectual property protection exist in Mexico, India and Thailand. In Mexico and Thailand, INMEGEN and TCELS are actively engaging in specific intellectual property and commercialization activities, which will hopefully offset the general opinion that these countries have traditionally weak patenting cultures, especially among academic and hospital researchers. However, establishing such intellectual property protection systems seems to involve different strategies. We found that INMEGEN, some members of the IGVdb Consortium, and the TCELS Pharmacogenomics Project were developing and exploring models to facilitate the translation of early stage research to commercialized products.",

We therefore searched for evidence of current small-to-medium enterprises that have, or are actively developing, human genomic medicine products and services. We did not find any specific firms in Mexico, although both Thailand (two start-up companies offering personal genotyping and wellness services were identified) and India (Avesthagen has announced it is initiating a large-scale genotyping project of the Parsi genome) show evidence of burgeoning local private-sector involvement in human genomic variation studies and genomic medicine. Despite the existence of a few companies, it is too early in their development to provide a detailed analysis of their capabilities, business models and economic benefit. However, key informants from the private sector did tell us that interfacing with public research centres is often a challenge.

In contrast to many developed countries, we found these three countries to be more focused on practical applications of genomics rather than solely on advanced basic research. Another difference between these three developing countries and other developed countries is the extent to which industry (for example, GlaxoSmithKline) drives genomics research and development in developed countries.
