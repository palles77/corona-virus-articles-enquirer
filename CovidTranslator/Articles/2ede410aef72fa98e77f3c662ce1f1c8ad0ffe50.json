Methods: Patient records of confirmed H1N1 influenza were analyzed at three geographic aggregation levels together with population census statistics. Results: The study confirmed that four population factors were related in different degrees to disease incidence, but the results varied according to spatial resolution. The degree of association actually decreased when data of a higher spatial resolution were used. Conclusions: We concluded that variables at suitable spatial resolution may be useful in improving the predictive powers of models for disease outbreaks.",

However, this trend shifted from infectious to chronic non-communicable diseases after the Second World War when much of the developing world was undergoing modernization or transition to become more developed [1] . Infectious diseases have regained prominence in recent decades and have caused significant social and economic impacts to the world [2, 3] . The most notable diseases were the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the H1N1 influenza in 2009 [4, 5] . SARS resulted in over 8 400 infected individuals from March to July 2003 in more than 30 countries around the world [6, 7] . The spread of H1N1 influenza was even more rapid. It started in Mexico in March 2009 and spread to more than 11 countries around the world within a month. Locally in Hong Kong, H1N1 appeared in early May 2009 and over 30 000 laboratory confirmed cases were reported within 6 months [8] .",

            "text": "Newly emerged infectious diseases have potentially far more damaging impacts because of rapid transmission. Researchers have thus suggested mathematical/epidemiological and simulation models to emulate disease surveillance or even predict disease spread [9, 10] . It has been argued that the performance of such predictive models could be improved with better heuristics (experience-based techniques for problem solving) as opposed to a pure data-driven approach. Research on identifying factors influencing the spread of a disease is thus necessary and becoming more important. For example, Merler analyzed the effects of population heterogeneity and mobility on the spread of pandemic influenza in 37 European countries by considering the European population, as well as their air and rail movements [11] . They concluded that various epidemiological parameters including basic reproduction number, cumulative attack rate and peak daily incidence rates depended heavily on socio-demographic factors, such as household size, percentage of worker population and percentage of student population. In examining the association between different socio-demographic variables and the number of SARS cases, Kwong and Lai found that the average number of rooms per household, net residential density and percentage of elderly population were significantly correlated with the number of SARS cases [12] . Abara et al. explored infectious diseases from the perspective of environmental justice and contended that infectious diseases were inextricably linked with environmental change and social determinants [13] . They further purported a holistic approach to consider socio-environmental determinants in future public health actions.",

Lai et al. applied GIS to examine the spatial distribution of SARS patients in Hong Kong based on their residential addresses [15] . They confirmed that the disease hot spots in urban areas did not occur randomly in space. Moreover, GIS and SaTScan\u2122 were used by Lee and Wong to explore the initial diffusion pattern of H1N1 influenza from 1 May to 31 July 2009 in Hong Kong [16] . Even though population density was found not significantly correlated with disease incidence, the study established that students played an important role in disseminating the disease. A follow-up study conducted by Lee and Wong, over a longer study period from 1 May to 30 September 2009, commented that the use of administrative districts in their earlier study in 2010 constrained their findings to reporting general patterns [17] . To visualize disease diffusion, 500 m \u00d7 500 m cells instead of district boundaries were adopted to remove the border effect in the analysis of spatial clustering using measures like global and local Moran's I and the space-time permutation in SaTScan\u2122. Spatio-temporal clusters were found in the study, but Lee and Wong also cautioned the lack of analysis by demographic categories as one of the limitations [17] .",

Our study, on the contrary, showed population density to be statistically and significantly correlated with disease incidence at various grid cell resolution for all cells with census data (r = 0.245, 0.290, 0.373; P < 0.01) as well as only cells with confirmed H1N1 (r = 0.225, 0.233, 0.264; P < 0.01).

Our study employing grid cells of uniform sizes appeared to be more sensitive in illuminating relationships than some 400 DCCAs. Indeed, a subsequent study by Lee and Wong [17] concurred that spatial analysis could be affected by data resolution. They indicated that the 18 Administrative Districts of Hong Kong were less appropriate for disease diffusion study than the finer resolution of 500 m \u00d7 500 m grid cells although they did not repeat the analysis on the relationship between population density and the number of case reports. Our study demonstrated successfully that the grid cell approach was able to extract the relationship hidden by larger aggregated spatial units. Our study also showed that excluding country parks (all cells with census data in Table 4 ) and excluding non-diseased grid cells (cells with H1N1 cases only in Table 4 ) offered additional discriminating powers to isolate salient factors in disease relationships. However, a higher spatial resolution does not necessarily mean improved associative relationships. By considering smaller spatial units of 200 m or 400 m, we introduced inevitably more data scattering and diminished health effects because of insufficient explanatory powers especially when disease cases in the earlier phases of an infection outbreak were not many. Finally, our study considered data in the early phases of the 2009 H1N1 outbreak (1 May-8 July 2009) whereas Lee and Wong [17] extended their data analysis to the end of July 2009. Their data analysis could be confounded by more rigorous intervention and control measures at the later stages of the outbreak. Hypotheses 2 and 3, respectively about disease incidence with the elderly population or cross-district work population exhibited significant relationships but their effect sizes were relatively small. Nevertheless, the positive relationships with disease incidence appeared logical. Elderly individuals were expected to have lower resistance to illnesses while the mobile cross-district workers were expected to have higher probabilities in contracting infectious diseases. The insignificant relationships between disease incidence and younger population (ages < 25) for hypothesis 1 were likely confounded by better hygiene and control measures at the school level. Even though the younger population made up the largest proportions of H1N1 cases as reported in Table 1 , the majority of infection occurred among school-age children attending the same school that did not seem to exhibit significant spatial association.",

Firstly, the gridded data are easy to manipulate in an automated setting. Secondly, the grid format seems to ameliorate the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem [24] . Even though grid cells may be preferred, aggregation by preset areal units (such as census subdivisions and administrative districts) has remained essential because they represent standard geographic units to collect census data or areas of jurisdiction to implement broad policies, laws and regulations. The grid format may be useful for analysis but it must be reconstituted into some preset administrative units to draw reference to area-based socio-economic measures. Our study showed that results would vary in accordance with spatial resolution. Errors and false alarms could be prevented or minimized by choosing the proper data resolution. One limitation in relying on risk factors based on local census is the inability to account for a sudden upsurge in disease occurrences arising from external sources. Nelson indicated that the SARS outbreak in 2003 originated from a visitor as opposed to a local resident [6] . Although the four factors could still be useful in simulating disease transmission, additional variables such as the occupancy rate of hotels within an area would be useful in estimating the potential of imported cases.",
