AGI-10 impinger was used as the representative for all the impingers which would bubble during operation. It was found that the survival probability of the same bacteriophage bubbling with different sampling solutions was different except that there was no significant difference observed for the bacteriophage F2. The use of SM as the collection fluid was relative to a high survival probability for the four bacteriophages. And the endurance or resistance of different kinds of bacteriophages in the same sampling solution was different. We conclude that SM is a promising sampling solution for liquid impingers in the process of sampling phages.",

(2004) has investigated the inactivation rate of four viruses in the bubbling process by using distilled water and Hank's solution with appropriate additives. It was concluded that the survival rates of the influenza, measles, and mumps viruses were increased compared to bubbling through the sterile water.

After overnight growth, the strains were streaked on nutrient agar petri dishes. When necessary, a new culture was grown from a single colony. The stock cultures were kept on nutrient agar petri dishes at 4\u00b0C. Host bacteria were infected with corresponding phages, and the completely lysed cultures were centrifuged at 4,000g for 15 min to remove bacterial debris. The supernatants were filtered through a 0.22-lm-pore size Millipore filter. The resulting phage stocks were stored at 4\u00b0C.

Three of them contained 9.95 ml of distilled water, PBS, and SM liquid, respectively, besides 0.05 ml of olive oil added as anti-foam, totally 10.0 ml each, designated as the first group; the rest three impingers contained 10.0 ml of distilled water, PBS, and SM liquid, respectively, without olive oil designated as the second group. Then 1 ll bacteriophage suspension (titration 10 8 -10 9 PFU/ml) was pipetted into each impinger and mixed fully. The impingers were operated at a flow rate of 7.0 l/min which was controlled by a flow meter. The bubbling process lasted for 30 min, and final volume of sampling solution was determined. Each group was repeated three times. At least three replicate measurements of the initial and final bacteriophage concentrations in the collection fluid were taken for each impinger. For all experiments, the air temperature was maintained between 20 and 23\u00b0C, and the relative humidity in cabinet was between 40 and 50%. The initial and final viable bacteriophage counts were determined by double-layer agar technique. Survival percentage correction was utilized for evaluation of bacteriophage resistance or endurance in ",

            "text": "Olive oil was added in sampling solution as antifoam to impede foam formation to reduce virus stress during bubbling. In order to investigate whether oil can affect the plaque formation of five targeted bacteriophages, we carried out the previously described experiments. The results indicated that olive oil did not seem to influence phage PFU counts as well as the morphology and size of plaque in static state in the very short term. This result was in correspondence with our previous observation that a very small amount of oil in suspension would not influence the non-enveloped and non-lipid-coated phages on formation of plaque. Phage SM701, SM702, and EcP1 belong to Caudovirales, and PhiX174 and F2 belong to Microviridae and Leviviridae, respectively. It has been known that phages of Caudovirales (including three families Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Podoviridae), Microviridae, and Leviviridae contain no lipids (Ackermann 1999) . We consider this might well elucidate earlier results. For phage EcP1, PhiX174, and F2, results of 30-min bubbling aeration indicated whether olive oil was added or not, corrected survival percentage were not significantly different (ANOVA, P [ 0.05), but the index was significantly higher in SM and DW than in PBS for EcP1 and higher in SM than in DW and PBS for PhiX174 (ANOVA, P \\ 0.05). There were no significant differences between sampling solutions, no matter whether or not adding olive oil as antifoam for phage F2 (ANOVA, P [ 0.05). The most complex situation occurred in phage SM702, of which corrected survival percentage in SM was significantly higher than in PBS and DW, no matter whether or not adding oil. Adding olive oil into DW or PBS except for SM might reduce the survival percentage correction of bacteriophage SM702. Enveloped or lipid-coated phages were absent in present study, but we might made an inference that those kinds of phages might be influenced by olive oil. However, this inference needs to be proved further by experiments. Agranovski investigated the inactivation rate of viruses in the bubbling process for a new personal bioaerosol sampler. Results indicated that the concentrations of influenza, mumps, and measles viruses decreased with bubbling time, but the vaccinia virus increased at the first hour then decreased with bubbling process in virus maintenance fluid (Agranovski et al. 2004) . Theoretically, it is impossible for survivable viruses' raise with bubbling. However, the concentration of survival agents might increase when the evaporation of sampling solution surpasses the decay of viruses. And in our previous study, the concentrations of robust or stress-endurable phage such as PhiX174 and SM702 could rise with time in SM before they were corrected, which made the survival line going up or appearing ''V'' type. Consequently, plaque counts should be corrected by a liquid evaporation percentage to actualize or illustrate a real situation for those impingers with fluid loss. Evaporation factor was cited in our study due to this consideration, and all results were corrected. Different bacteriophages might have different resistance or endurance to bubbling aeration in the same sampling solution. And the number of viable bacteriophages could become lower with the bubbling time prolonged (as Fig. 1 illustrated) . It is well known that phages consist of coat protein and nucleic acid which are enclosed by it. We suppose that the inactivation of phage was caused by the high-velocity air flow and bubbles, which helped the phages to reach a gas-liquid interface depriving of the property of infectivity (Adams 1948) . Reaerosolized bacteriophage caused by bursting of the bubbles at the liquidair surface was numerated in this study. The result indicated that the number was extremely trivial and could almost be ignored compared to the initial counts. This index, however, might be useful and helpful for evaluating the biocollecting efficiency of impingers indirectly.",
