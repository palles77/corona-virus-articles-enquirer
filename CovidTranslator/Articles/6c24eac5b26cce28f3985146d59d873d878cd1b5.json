            "text": "Recently, AdvanSure\u2122 kit based on multiplex real-time PCR was developed for simultaneous detection of 14 respiratory viruses (RVs). We compared the performance of AdvanSure with those of Seeplex\u00ae RV 15 ACE and culture by determining their sensitivities and specificities against a composite reference standard. Four hundred thirty-seven respiratory samples were tested by modified shell vial culture method, RV 15 ACE, and AdvanSure. One hundred fourteen samples (26.2%) out of 437 samples were positive by culture, while additional 91 (20.8%) were positive by AdvanSure or RV15. One hundred twelve of 114 culture-positive samples were positive by AdvanSure except 2 samples (1 adenovirus, 1 respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]). Overall, the sensitivities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure were 74.5%, 89.8%, and 95.1%, respectively. Sensitivities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure for each virus tested were as follows: 91/100/96% for influenza A, 60/0/100% for influenza B, 63/95/97% for RSV, 69/81/89% for adenovirus, and 87/93/93% for parainfluenza virus. For viruses not covered by culture, sensitivities of RV15 and AdvanSure were as follows: 77/88% for rhinovirus, 100/100% for coronavirus OC43, 40/100% for coronavirus 229E/NL63, 13/100% for metapneumovirus, and 44/100% for bocavirus. The overall specificities of culture, RV15, and AdvanSure were 100/98.9/ 99.5%, respectively. Of 45 coinfected specimens, AdvanSure detected 41 specimens (91.1%) as coinfected, while RV15 detected 27 specimens (60.0%) as coinfected. AdvanSure assay demonstrated exquisite performance for the detection of RVs and will be a valuable tool for the management of RV infection.",

Of 45 coinfected specimens, AdvanSure detected 41 specimens (91.1%) as coinfected, while RV15 detected 27 specimens (60.0%) as coinfected. Although the contradictory conclusions on the clinical impact of viral coinfections have been reported (Vallieres and Renaud, 2013) , several studies have pointed out that multiple virus infections are associated with a more severe clinical course (Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2013) . As simultaneous control of all coinfected viruses becomes more important goal of medical treatment, AdvanSure assay would provide clinicians with better infectious status of patients than RV15 (Zhang et al., 2012) . As expected, AdvanSure and RV15 showed sensitivities superior to culture. For influenza A, viral culture showed good sensitivity similar to both of them, but lower sensitivities for RSV and adenovirus, as in other studies (Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al., 2010; Sanghavi et al., 2012) . Among 5 influenza B positives, 3 were detected by culture, and 5, by AdvanSure, while none of them were detected by RV15. In the previous study evaluating Seeplex RV12 detection kit (Seegene, Rockville, MD, USA), viral culture, RV12, and real-time PCR detected 8, 6, and 11 of 11 influenza B-positive specimens, respectively (Bruijnesteijn van Coppenraet et al., 2010) . In that study, RV12 based on a dual priming oligonucleotide system (DPO) demonstrated less clinical sensitivity for detection of influenza B than viral culture, while real-time PCR showed the greatest analytical and clinical sensitivity. Similarly, our study demonstrated that RV15 with DPO technology was less sensitive for influenza B than viral culture, while AdvanSure was the most sensitive for influenza B virus.",

Similarly, in this study, bocaviruses presented most frequently with adenoviruses (77.8%, 7/9).
