            "text": "Australian infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) have undergone a separate evolution due to geographic isolation. Consequently, changes occurring in Australian IBV illustrate, independently from other countries, types of variability that could occur in emerging IBV strains. Previously, we have identified two distinct genetic groups of IBV, designated subgroups 1 and 2. IBV strains of subgroup 1 have S1 and N proteins that share a high degree of amino acid identity, 81 to 98% in S1 and 91 to 99% in N. Subgroup 2 strains possess S1 and N proteins that share a low level of identity with subgroup 1 strains: 54 to 62% in S1 and 60 to 62% in N. This paper describes the isolation and characterisation of a third, previously undetected genetic group of IBV in Australia. The subgroup 3 strains, represented by isolate chicken/Australia/N2/04, had an S1 protein that shared a low level of identity with both subgroups 1 and 2: 61 to 63% and 56 to 59%, respectively. However, the N protein and the 3 untranslated region were similar to subgroup 1: 90 to 97% identical with the N protein of subgroup 1 strains. This N4/02 subgroup 3 of IBV is reminiscent of two other strains, D1466 and DE072, isolated in the Netherlands and in the USA, respectively. The emergence of the subgroup 3 viruses in Australia, as well as the emergence of subgroup 2 in 1988, could not be explained by any of the mechanisms that are currently considered to be involved in generation of IBV variants.",

In young chicks, respiratory disease or nephritis lead to mortalities, reduced weight gain and condemnation at processing, whereas in chickens of laying age, the disease is subclinical and results in reduced egg production and aberrant eggs [7] . Since the causative agent, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), is endemic on all commercial sites, most flocks are vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines. However, outbreaks of IB continue to occur, particularly at sites with high concentrations of poultry, and a great number of IBV variants have been isolated and characterised in an attempt to understand IBV epidemiology and improve its control [7, 13-15, 24, 27, 32, 35, 37] .",

            "text": "IBV, together with turkey and pheasant coronaviruses, belongs to Group 3 of the genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae [6, 16] . All members of this genus have a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 27 kilo-bases (kb) in length. The first 20 kb encode the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase and proteases. The remainder of the genome encodes the five structural proteins, the spike (S) consisting of S1 and S2, envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, four small non-structural proteins, 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b, and a 3 untranslated region (UTR). Variations in the S1 and N genes, in particular, are believed to be of critical importance for emergence of variants because of their role in virus replication and immunity, and hence S1 and N have been used most frequently to determine the relatedness of emerging IBV. The S1 glycoprotein is located on the surface of the virion and carries epitopes and determinants for virus-neutralising antibodies, protective immunity and cell tropism [5, 8, 19] . The N protein, located in the capsid of the virion is involved in RNA replication and carries group-specific antigenic determinants [20] . The 3 UTR region is involved in initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis and has also been used to assess variation in emerging IBV strains and other members of coronavirus Group 3 [3, 38, 42] .",

The S1 genes of IBV variants isolated from vaccinated flocks in Africa, Asia, Europe, Central and South America, the Middle East and the USA share between 75 and 99% amino acid identity [9, 10, 32, 39, 44] , whereas the N genes share >94% amino acid identity [41, 45] . Based on the S1 gene sequences, strains within this tentatively named European/USA lineage belong to a number of phylogenetic clusters [14, 34, 38, 43] . However, some strains isolated in different countries may belong to the same phylogenetic cluster, having almost identical S1 genes [32, 35] , reflecting some of the common features of IBV evolutionary direction. The phylogenetic analysis based on the N gene sequences usually follows closely the phylogenetic clustering based on the S1 gene [14, 41, 45] . In the European/USA lineage there have been only two exceptions to this commonly observed sequence conservation, strains D1466 and DE076, isolated in the Netherlands and the USA [15, 27, 28] . The S1 genes of both strains share a low level of amino acid identity, 46-53%, with the S1 genes of other IBV strains [15] , however, the N sequence in both strains is conserved, having >92% identity at the amino acid level with the N gene of other strains [30] .",

The S1 genes of Australian and European/USA strains share >77% identity at the amino acid level [37] , however, by phylogenetic analysis, Australian IBVs belong to a distinct lineage [15, 37, 39] . Within the Australian IBV lineage, there are two distinct genetic and antigenic groups of strains: IBV strains of one group, termed subgroup 1, have S1 and N proteins that share a level of identity found in strains of the European/USA linage: 81-98% identity in the S1 protein and 91-99% in the N protein [37, 38] . IBV strains of subgroup 2 have very different S1 and N proteins: amino acid identity with subgroup 1 is 54-62% in S1 and 60-62% in N [37, 38] . IBVs similar to the subgroup 2 strains have not been detected within the European/USA linage. Comparative sequence analysis of all members of the family Coronaviridae has indicated that the subgroup 1 strains cluster together with other strains of the European/USA lineage into one subgroup within Group 3, whereas the subgroup 2 strains belong to a separate cluster (subgroup) in the same Group 3 [16] .",

An alignment of the deduced S1 amino acid sequences for these ten NSW isolates showed that all shared a high degree of homology with each other (results not shown). The deduced S1 amino acid sequences for three representative isolates, N4/02, N5/03 and N4/03, are presented in Fig. 1 , aligned with the vaccine strain VicS.

The S1 sequence of the newly isolated IBV strains differed significantly when compared with vaccine, subgroup 1 and subgroup 2 IBV strains. The new isolates had extensive amino acid changes through the entire length of S1, similar to changes observed in subgroup 2 strains. However, the amino acid changes within the S1 proteins of N4/02, N5/03 and N4/03, were different from those found in either N1/88, Q3/88 or V18/91.

The Mab antigen ELISA has been used routinely in our laboratory to predict the antigenic type of an isolated IBV, as it is able to discriminate between vaccine viruses, subgroup 1 strains and subgroup 2 strains [18, 21] . Isolation of the N4/02 group of viruses, which by Mab ELISA were predicted to be in subgroup 1, whereas by sequencing of S1 were shown to form a new subgroup, has therefore compromised the predictive value of the Mab ELISA.

If the VicS vaccine, the strain most closely related genetically to N4/02, was an ancestor, then the VicS S1 gene would have had to undergo multiple mutations throughout the entire S1 gene. Such a high mutation rate has not been encountered thus far in IBV, either in field or experimental infections [9, 10] . Accumulation of mutations over time could have given rise to strains that bear some similarity with N4/02, and from which N4/02 could have further evolved by mutations. However, monitoring of broilers for IBV variants over recent years did not detect any such strains (37, J. Ignjatovic and K. Mardani, unpublished results). If recombination was involved in the generation of N4/02, two different viruses could have been the source of the S1 gene and N gene/3 UTR. Such a recombination event is theoretically feasible since regions between the S1 and N genes are involved in recombination [4, 30] . However, while the source virus for the N gene and 3 UTR might have been a subgroup 1 strain of IBV such as N1/62, the source of the S1 gene is unknown. The origin of two other similar strains, D1466 and DE072 [15, 28] , is also unclear. Differences between the S1 gene sequences of the DE072 and D1466 and other IBV strains indicate that they did not originate directly from live vaccine viruses or other common IBV strains [15] . Instead, it is speculated that D1466 and DE072 had the same origin, which is different from other IBVs [31] , but that two viruses diverged a long time ago and evolved independently in different geographical locations [30] . Although this might have happened, it is not clear what their origin is and, if they have evolved over time, why strains with some S1 sequence similarity to either D1466 or DE072 had not been detected in either location prior to their sudden emergence.",

One possibility is that the N4/02 type, as well as subgroup 2 strains, have been introduced into broiler chicks from an unknown source, possibly another avian species. Analysis of more than fifty IBV strains isolated in Australia between 1961 and 2002 did not detect any IBV resembling either subgroup 2 or N4/02 type prior to their emergence in 1988 and 2002, respectively [22; K. Mardani personal communication]. Both subgroup 2 and the N4/02 type of IBV caused outbreaks in vaccinated flocks over a prolonged period of time and required introduction of homologous vaccines for their control (J. Ignjatovic, unpublished observation). Hence, because of their unique genetic, antigenic and immunogenic properties, it is unlikely that precursors to subgroup 2 and N4/02 type of IBV could have circulated in poultry over a prolonged period without being detected.",

Currently, little is known about the relevance of other types of avian coronaviruses and avian species other than chickens as reservoirs for the epidemiology of IBV [6] . Recently, turkey coronaviruses were shown to be more similar to IBV than to mammalian coronaviruses, where they had been classified for many years [17] . The N proteins and 3 UTR of turkey coronaviruses and IBV share \u226590% amino acid and \u226578% nucleotide identity, respectively [1, 3, 11, 33] . However, the S1 genes of turkey coronaviruses share only 33% amino acid identity with the S1 protein of IBV [33] . Turkey coronaviruses, however, are not considered recombinants of IBV, but to be a species genetically distinct from IBV [11, 17] . Similarly, it is possible that N2/04 is not a recombinant, but an avian coronavirus originating from another avian species that has crossed into commercial chickens. It has been highlighted previously that the evolution of IBV is a complex, and poorly understood process [23] , and this still remains so. The criteria and attributes that differentiate one avian coronavirus from others are currently unclear [6] . Recently, coronaviruses that are similar to IBV have been isolated from pheasants, domestic peafowl and teals [12, 34] . However, coronaviruses isolated from graylag gees, feral pigeons and mallard ducks differed significantly, with some unique genetic features [25] .",
