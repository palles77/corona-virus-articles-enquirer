            "text": "Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that CNS microglial cells, which become activated locally during neuronal regeneration and degeneration, demonstrate an upregulation of a number of intracellular and surface molecules (reviewed in (33)). One aspect of the microglial activation process concerns the elevated expression of antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). After axotomy of the facial nerve there is markedly enhanced appearance of MHC class I antigens predominantly on perineuronal microglial cells (34), as detected with monoclonal antibody . In addition, within the first week after axotomy some scattered cells in the regenerating facial nucleus reveal a positive reaction with monoclonal antibodies directed against MHC class II (Ia) molecules. Both, the uniform expression of class I antigens by microglia, as well as the scattered appearance of some Ia-positive cells in the sublethally injured and regenerating facial nucleus may indicate an elevated state of immune responsiveness of certain cellular elements of nervous tissue. However, since nerve transection represents a sublethal and sterile lesion that is not accompanied by an infiltration of blood-borne cells, the accentuated expression of MHC molecules may also suggest a yet unknown function of MHC antigens related to nerve regeneration.",

As part of the local glial reaction to neuronal death there is massive proliferation of microglia and the formation of microglia-derived brain macrophages. Similar to the axotomy paradigm, there are no detectable inflammatory infiltrates of blood-borne cells in the degenerating facial nucleus. In the present study we sought to further investigate the time course of occurrence of Ia-positive cells in the axotomized facial nucleus and to identify the cell type(s) responsible for MHC class II expression. In addition, we wanted to compare qualitatively the temporal and spatial distribution of Iapositive cells after sublethal (axotomy) and lethal (ricin injection) neuronal injury.",

Numerous Ia-positive cells were seen in the meninges, and the pattern of staining observed here was identical to that described by Vass et al. (38) . The brain parenchyma including the unoperated facial nucleus was largely devoid of Ia immunoreactivity. In some areas of white matter, notably in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, the cerebellar peduncles, and the spinal trigeminal tract, Ia-positive microglial cells could be identified (Fig. 2C) . These resting microglia were labeled with mAb OX-17 and 0X-6, but not with 0X-3. Ia-immunoreactive microglia were also found in the cerebellar gray matter, although this was an uncommon finding. Generally, the occurrence of Ia-expressing resting microglia was limited to white matter. In addition, other Ia-positive cells could be observed consistently in sections of normal brain including the unoperated facial nucleus. These cells were seen to occur singly, and thelial cells, as the endothelial surface of vessels was alseemed to be randomly distributed throughout the brain ways negative for Ia antigen. Instead they seemed to be regions examined. They were often observed in close asof the perivascular type, possibly representing a cell popsociation with small vessels (Fig. 2B ), but were not endoulation related to pericytes. During the first week after axotomy there was a noticeable increase in the number of Ia antigen-expressing cells in the axotomized facial nucleus compared to the unoperated side (Figs. 3A and 3B). In almost every instance the close association of these cells with small blood vessels could be confirmed. The cells were often elongated and their cytoplasmic processes were in alignment with the course of the vessels (Fig. 3C) . Perineuronal microglia, a most prominent histologic feature during the early stages of the retrograde reaction, were rarely found to be Ia immunoreactive in any of the preparations examined at this time. Some scattered microglia expressing Ia antigens on their ramified processes were, however, quite apparent in regions of white matter surrounding the facial nucleus (Fig. 3D) . Occasional ramified microglia demonstrated Ia expression also in the root of the axotomized nerve, but there was no obvious increase in immunostaining compared to the contra-Iateral unoperated side. In contrast, the nerve root of the degenerating facial nucleus after ricin application showed an early increase in Ia immunoreactivity 3 days after surgery. In bilaterally operated animals microglial cells in the genu n. facialis revealed intense immunostaining on the ricin-treated side compared to that on the axotomized side (Figs. 4C and 4D). During these early time points considerably more Ia-positive cells could also be identified in the degenerating than in the axotomized nucleus (Figs. 4A and 4B) .",

During this time period there seemed to be a slight preponderance of Ia-positive cells in the degenerating compared to the regenerating facial nucleus. While this quantitative difference was not striking, in qualitative terms considerable differences were noted between ricin-treated and axotomized nuclei after identical postoperative survival periods. The number of Ia-expressing microglial cells increased on the ri- tin side at the expense of rapidly disappearing perivascular cells, and by the end of the fourth week almost the entire population of Ia-positive cells consisted of ramified microglia (Figs. 5E and 5F). In contrast, after axotomy perivascular cells were conspicuous until the end of week 4, at which time approximately equal proportions of perivascular and microglial cells were present (Figs. 5A and 5B). In some of these preparations we were able to observe Ia-expressing cells with a transitional morphology intermediate between perivascular and microglial cells suggesting differentiation of perivascular cells into microglia (Figs. 5C and 5D). As survival times after axotomy exceeded 1 month, more microglial cells kept appearing while Ia-positive perivascular cells were decreasing (Fig. 6 ). Whereas after 3 months hardly any Iapositive cells could be detected in the ricin-treated nucleus, Ia-positive cells persisted on the axotomized side in the form of ramified microglia until day 128. Quite frequently perineuronally located microglial cells were observed during these late stages.

In view of the overall low density of Ia-positive perivascular cells in normal brain, however, this cell population could not possibly include all pericytes and is thus likely to represent either a subpopulation of pericytes or a separate population of pericyte-like cells. We suggest using the term \"perivascular cell\" until the identity of this cell population is elucidated.

Regarding the time course we found that the appearance and disappearance of Ia-positive cells happens faster during ricin-induced degeneration than after axotomy. In both experimental situations Ia immunoreactivity first becomes apparent on perivascular cells located within the basal lamina, but with longer postoperative survival periods there is a tendency for Ia-positive microglia to appear. This shift in morphology and location of Ia-positive cells is complete at least 2 weeks earlier after ricin treatment than after transection. Thus, if Ia expression is considered to indicate immunological activation of microglia, it can be concluded that microglial immune competence is achieved sooner with increased severity of the lesion. This concept is supported by earlier findings, namely, that during ricin-induced degeneration local microglia demonstrate significantly enhanced mitotic activity compared to simple nerve crush lesions and transform into brain macrophages (32). It remains to be shown what, if any, neuronal and/or glial factors are released in an injury-dependent manner to regulate microglial activation.",

Our previous studies with mAb OX-18 and another antibody against class I molecules which showed no reactivity (34), as well as the present study employing ultrastructural immunocytochemistry, have consistently failed to demonstrate immunoreactivity on structures other than the microglial and endothelial cell surfaces. Possibly, OX-18 staining of neurons is caused either by differences in fixation or by nonspecific binding of the secondary biotinylated antibody which, in our experience, needs to be preabsorbed with normal serum from the strain of experimental animals used in order to achieve the lowest background staining. The weak staining results obtained with mAb OX-3 in comparison with those obtained with mAbs OX-17 and OX-6 are likely to be caused by OX-3 having a binding affinity toward a polymorphic determinant of Ia antigen. Unlike monomorphic determinants which are found in all individuals of a species, polymorphic determinants are found only in some (17).",

            "text": "Hickey and Kimura (16) have recently reported about perivascular microglia that are bone marrow derived and function as antigen presenting cells in the rat CNS. Since the present results offer further support for the immune competence of perivascular cells and microglia, a clarifying remark about the terminology employed seems appropriate at this point. The term \"perivascular microglia\" is used to describe the anatomic location of some parenchymal microglia lying outside the basal lamina of blood vessels (5, 27, 31) , while the term \"perivascular cell\" refers to a pericyte-like cell enclosed within the basal lamina and thus located outside the brain parenchyma (12). On the basis of their morphology and Iaimmunoreactivity, the cells described by Hickey and Kimura are most likely identical with the perivascular cells described here. However, we would like to extend their observations by suggesting that the Ia-positive microglia we observed after late postoperative intervals when perivascular cells were decreasing arise through morphological transformation of Ia-positive perivascular cells. This is based mainly on our observation that concomitant to the disappearance of Ia-positive perivascular cells there is an increase in Ia-positive microglia up to a point where almost all perivascular cells have disappeared and microglia predominate. Further support for such a transformational process comes from the studies of Hager (13) showing that in traumatized brain tissue perivascular cells can break through the basement membrane and become microglia. In addition, Bartlett (3) reported that the adult rodent brain contains large numbers of hemopoietic stem cells which may be a source of microglia. Clearly, the subpopulation of microglia that may arise from perivascular cells represents only a minority of the total microglial population, because very few Ia-positive microglia can be identified in the facial nucleus during the first week after lesioning when microglial proliferation peaks (18). However, during that early period microglia are strongly positive for MHC class I antigens (34). Therefore, we propose that the total microglial population is heterogeneous with regard to their ability to express different MHC antigens, as well as with regard to their recent origin. While the majority of microglia are already present in the normal brain, under pathological conditions perivascular cells may become stimulated to form an auxillary, albeit small, source of antigen presenting cells in addition to the existing population. This concept of microglial heterogeneity could help to explain the long-standing and continuing debate about the origin of microglia (cf. (22)).",

The most potent stimulatory substance known is interferony (IFN-7) which has been shown to induce Ia expression on microglia in uiuo (30). However, we have so far been unable to detect IFN-7 either immunocytochemically or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in regenerating or degenerating facial nuclei. Probably other, yet unknown, factors may be involved in regulating Ia expression under these conditions. The fact that inflammatory infiltrates consisting of T lymphocytes are absent in our models further supports the involvement of alternative stimulatory factors. Thus, if the peripheral immune sys-tem is not involved one may postulate a nonimmunological function of Ia antigens during glial reactions. It has been demonstrated that MHC class II antigens can mediate cell adhesion by interacting directly with the CD4 antigen of lymphocytes (6). The authors have suggested that this interaction may be important for cellular communication among lymphocytes, so that, by the same token, the presence of both class II and CD4 antigens on CNS microglia (26) might facilitate similar interactions among this cell type. This thought seems especially attractive in view of the recent demonstration that microglial cells also express antigens typical for B lymphocytes (24).",

The reason for this is presently unknown, but it is an intriguing finding that could account for the susceptibility of white matter to demyelination in multiple sclerosis. Woodroofe et al.

Similarly, during acute EAE in the rat GFAP-positive fibrous astrocytes are prominent in gray matter (2), as well as Iapositive perivascular cells and microglia (38). On the basis of these observations one could speculate that the occurrence of GFAP-positive fibrous astrocytes and Iapositive microglia in gray matter are regulated simultaneously or mutually through chemical changes in the microenvironment of injured central nervous tissue. For example, the release of interleukin-1 from microglia (9) or interleukin-3 from astrocytes (7) during the early stages after injury could be such a chemical change, since the interleukins have been shown to act as growth factors for microglia and astrocytes.",
