            "text": "The G-quadruplex structure forming motifs have recently emerged as a novel therapeutic drug target in various human pathogens. Herein, we report three highly conserved G-quadruplex motifs (SE-PGQ -1, 2, and3) in genome of all the 412 strains of Salmonella enterica. Bioinformatics analysis inferred the presence of SE-PGQ-1 in the regulatory region of mgtA, presence of SE-PGQ-2 in the open reading frame of entA and presence of SE-PGQ-3 in the promoter region of malE and malK genes. The products of mgtA and entA are involved in transport and homeostasis of Mg 2+ and Fe 3+ ion and thereby required for bacterial survival in the presence of reactive nitrogen/oxygen species produced by the host macrophages, whereas, malK and malE genes are involved in transport of maltose sugar, that is one of the major carbon source in the gastrointestinal tract of human. The formation of stable intramolecular G-quadruplex structures by SE-PGQs was confirmed by employing CD, EMSA and NMR spectroscopy. Cellular studies revealed the inhibitory effect of 9-amino acridine on Salmonella enterica growth. Next, CD melting analysis demonstrated the stabilizing effect of 9-amino acridine on SE-PGQs. Further, polymerase inhibition and RT-qPCR assays emphasize the biological relevance of predicted G-quadruplex in the expression of PGQ possessing genes and demonstrate the G-quadruplexes as a potential drug target for the devolping novel therapeutics for combating Salmonella enterica infection.",

As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), typhoid fever causes ~22 million new cases and ~200,000 deaths every year across the world [9, 10] . The emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance for chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, azithromycin and cephalosporin make the situation more dangerous and thus leading to increased death rate due to clinical treatment failure [11] [12] [13] . More recently, severe complications with Salmonella species have emerged and connected to multiple invasive disorders like irritable bowel syndrome [14] , reactive arthritis [15] , bacteremia [16] focal infection [17] , meningitis [18] and infectious aortitis [19] . Due to its high prevalence and rapid emergence of drug resistance, Salmonella ring a global alarm for the development of novel and promising therapeutic approaches. A more effective and efficient therapeutic approach would be required to target the expression of those genes that were previously observed to be associated with essential nutrient acquisition system and remained conserved throughout the evolution in the genome of this deadly human pathogen.",

Disc diffusion assay and MTT cytotoxicity assay confirmed the growth inhibition of S. enterica cells by 9-amino acridine molecule. Further, Real-time -quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) revealed the reduced expression of genes that harbor the SE-PGQs in either their coding region or regulatory region upon the treatment with 9-amino acridine.

In order to investigate this hypothesis, we incubated PCR reaction mixture with 9-amino acridine in a concentration dependent manner and then performed PCR amplification. We observed diminished intensity of bands with increase in concentration of 9-amino acridine, however, in the absence of the 9 amino acridine the band intensity was maximum indicated that the Taq polymerase were able to extend the SE-PGQs motifs.

For example, HIV-1 promoter region possessed a G-quadruplex motif in long terminal repeat (LTR) region of their genome and observed to be critical for its proliferation. BRACO-19 has shown anti-HIV-1 activity by stabilizing G-quadruplex motif present in the LTR region [42] . Similarly, stabilization of G-quadruplex structure present in the core gene of HCV genome by PDP, halts its replication, translation and therefore can be used as potential antihepatitis therapeutics [57] . Pyridostatin is also observed to stabilize the G-quadruplex structure formed in the mRNA of nuclear antigen 1 protein of EBV leading to its translation suppression [58] . Recently,",

            "text": "S. enterica strains. The bioinformatics analysis gave a boost to our hypothesis as we received an ample number of potential G-quadruplex motifs in the genome of S. enterica strains. Interestingly three Gquadruplex forming motifs were found to be conserved in \u2265 98% strains of Salmonella enterica andpresent in three different locations namely i) SE-PGQ-1 in the regulatory region of mgtA, ii) SE-PGQ-2 in open reading frame of entA gene. iii) and SE-PGQ-3 in the regulatory region shared by maltose operon genes: malK, and malE gene.1D 1 H NMR spectroscopy was used to confirm the formation of Gquadruplex structure by all SE-PGQs whereas EMSA demonstrated the intramolecular G-quadruplex structure formation by SE-PGQs. CD spectroscopy was used to confirm the topology of SE-PGQs in solution. Taken together, the NMR, CD, and EMSA results allow us to conclude that the SE-PGQ-1 and SE-PGQ-3 motifs form intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures whereas SE-PGQ-2 form intramolecular mixed type of G-quadruplex structures. Similar to G-quadruplex motif present in genome of another human pathogen, a G-quadruplex motif present in mgtA, malK, malE and entA genes of S. enterica strains may also serve as a potential developing anti-bacterial therapy . These G-rich targets can also overcome the problem of the drug resistance due to their high conservedness in both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant bacterial strains. Since these PGQs were present in the promoter region of mgtA, malE and malK and the open reading frame of entA gene, we explore the stabilizing effect of 9-amino acridine on SE-PGQs. Firstly, CD melting analysis revealed the increased thermos-stability of the SE-PGQs by exhibiting an increase in their melting temperature(T m ) in the presence of the 9 amino acridine. The observed \u0394T m values were observed as 6.94 \u00baC, 10.98 \u00baC and 8.78 \u00baC for SE-PGQ-1, SE-PGQ-2, and SE-PGQ-3 respectively. Further, binding of 9-amino acridine to SE-PGQs reveled the stallation of the movement of DNA replication machinery across G4 motifs. Next, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of 9-amino acridine on S. enterica growth; IC 50 value was calculated to be 10.50 \u00b5M. Highly stable G-quadruplexes in the regulatory regions and open reading frame of genes were previously shown to down-regulate the expression of genes [60-62]. The treatment of S. enterica cultures with 9-amino acridine led to a decrease in the expression of entA, mgtA, malK and MalE genes relative to 16S rRNA, suggesting a G-quadruplex mediated inhibition mechanism is involved in this process. As a schematic model elaborated in Fig 11, Gquadruplex mediated inhibition of entA, mgtA, malK and MalE genes is expected to increase the innate immune response of host cell and reduced survival of bacterium inside the host cell. The Inhibited expression of the entA and mgtA proteins would make the bacteria unable to response against Reactive oxygen/nitrogen (ROS/RNS)species and reduced their survival inside the host macrophages.",
