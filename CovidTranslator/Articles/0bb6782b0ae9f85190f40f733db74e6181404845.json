(Figure 5 .1) was displayed in front of the Potala Palace, the Dalai Lama's former residence, just before the national ceremony of the 'Fiftieth Anniversary of Peaceful Liberation of Tibet' in the summer of 2001. On the surface, the slogan appears to be a mundane tourist greeting. However, the implicit message is that it is thanks to Chinese leadership and support that Tibet was liberated, opened, and is now enjoying the fruits of a booming tourist economy. The content of the slogan is monologic, a kind of oblique expression of Chinese paternalism towards its ethnic minorities; indeed, it is the naturalisation of its governance that the Chinese state wants to reinforce through its direct intervention in tourist development.",

First, a general perspective on the development of tourism in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) will be given. The preferences and motivations of the increasing number of tourists, particularly Han Chinese, will then be described and examined. Lastly, some political aspects of the development of tourism will be pointed out through looking at the representation of Tibetan culture found in the media and various types of propaganda displayed on the streets. The information in this chapter is based on a two-year stay in Lhasa, from 2000 to 2002, and on subsequent return visits and close monitoring of events in the country.",

During the early stages of this development, some local tourist agencies and hotels were founded to accommodate the growing number of tourists. Infrastructure conducive to accessing Lhasa was also established, for example the international flight from Kathmandu to Lhasa, which most Western tourists use, was introduced in 1987. Some of the main temples and monasteries, which had been damaged or destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, were partly restored using central government subsidies. As a consequence, the number of international tourists, which was less than two thousand per annum until 1984, reached more than forty thousand by 1987. This growth was expected to continue, but was suddenly terminated due to the numerous political demonstrations for 'Tibet Independence' which took place in Lhasa towards the end of the 1980s. Accordingly, martial law was declared, and foreign tourists and journalists alike were expelled.",

            "text": "However, after martial law was lifted, recovery came swiftly. In 1992, the number of tourists exceeded past records. In the five-year plan initiated in 1991 large projects were designed to develop some tourist facilities and services: Lhasa Gonggar Airport was hugely expanded in 1993 and the restoration of the Potala Palace was completed in 1994. Subsequently, the Potala was included on the UNESCO World Heritage List and, accordingly, during the 1990s, the number of foreign visitors increased dramatically (see Figure 5 .2), together with an even greater increase in the number of domestic tourists. According to an official document Tibet Academy of Social Science (TASS, 2002, p. 205) , the average growth rate in foreign arrivals from 1995 to 2000 was 11.7 per cent, while domestic arrivals increased by 22.4 per cent, and tourism income grew at an average of 29.6 per cent. During the 1990s, income from tourism in TAR more than doubled from the first to the second five-year period. 'Tibet Tour' (Xizang l\u00fcyou) has become a pillar industry in acquiring foreign exchange, despite international pressure on China over its handling of human rights issues in Tibet. At the administrative level, however, the tourism industry continued to prioritise political stability (wending), hoping to prevent the re-emergence of political demonstrations, whose contact between Tibetans and international tourists was considered to ignite. Towards the end of the 1990s, therefore, new regulations governing people involved in the tourism industry and the management of foreign visitors were passed and proclaimed (Hu & Chen, 2001, pp. 50-52) .",

As the China Statistical Bureau between 2000 and 2005 the average rate of increase of Chinese tourists was nearly 30 per cent every year. In contrast to international tourists, domestic tourists were hardly affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) turmoil in and around China in 2003. In 2005, there were around 1.7 million Chinese visitors to Tibet, more than a dozen times greater than international tourists. In 2006, due to the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway connecting Tibet with China Proper (Neidi), it is believed that the number of domestic tourists would approach, or even equal, that of the whole population of Tibet (2.6 million). The number of the tourists present at any one time is not officially announced. However, in the summer of 2006 their presence was significantly overwhelming in Lhasa's cityscape. These Chinese tourists are from the recently emerging affluent middle class, mainly from coastal metropolises such as Beijing and Shanghai, or adjacent provinces such as Sichuan.",

            "text": "During the research period in Lhasa between 2000 and 2002, the government's efforts to celebrate and stabilise the development of tourism were evident, as indicated by a number of symbolic events. In December 2000, Lhasa's main temple, the Jokhang, was successfully recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as an extension of the earlier inscription of the Potala. Only two weeks later, Lhasa was awarded the title of 'Top Tourist City of China' (zhongguo youxiu l\u00fcyou chengshi, which literally means 'China's excellent tourist city') by the National Tourism Administration (NTA), an official body of the central government. This was in approval of the ongoing activities of the Tibet Tourism Bureau (TTB) which aimed to 'create excellence' (chuang you) in presenting Lhasa as a tourist city. In February 2001, four main tourist spots in Lhasa (the Potala, the Jokhang, the Norbulinka and the Tibet Museum) were given a title of '4A', again by the NTA, which signified state recognition of their superior value as tourist sites. In June of the same year, just before the high tourist season, the local government declared the second Saturday of June as 'Tibet Tourism Day' (Xizang l\u00fcyou ri). To celebrate this new creation, some five thousand Tibetan youths were called to gather in the Potala Square for a ceremony. Some were then sent to various tourist spots to clean them up, while others remained to serve as volunteer guides for tourists. The theme of 'Tibet Tourism Day' that year was 'Tourism and Youth', and was explicitly intended to make the people -particularly the educated youth -more aware of the significance of tourism for the development of Tibet. Local newspaper articles give a strong sense of how confident the authorities felt in the development of tourism. During the tourist season, the 'miraculous success' of the industry was repeatedly reported with hyperbolic expressions such as 'Extraordinarily Explosive'; 'TAR's tourism has entered its 'Golden Age'; 'Let Tourism be a Dragon's Head for the TAR's Development'. In 2000, 162 travel agencies and 84 hotels were operating in the TAR to accommodate the increasing number of tourists, over four thousand local people (of whom an alleged 60 per cent were Tibetan) were employed in the tourist industry, and the number of employees in related industries was estimated to be nearly thirty thousand (TASS, 2002, pp. 205-206) .",

According to official understanding often expressed in local newspapers, not only tour guides, but also many other local employees working in the tourist industry, were considered as relatively poorly educated and, therefore, generally lacking in the 'aptitude' (suzhi) necessary to provide satisfactory tourist services. This situation is part of a general problem concerning Lhasa's (and TAR's) economic development, since high investment in infrastructure and facilities has not been matched by the investment in education which would provide the number of skilled local workers necessary for further development to take place (Fischer, 2005) .",

There are plenty of studies concerning Western fantasies and imaginations about Tibet, investigated by scholars of Tibetology and cultural studies (e.g. Bishop, 1989; Lopez, 1998) . Just to recap, the mystic and exotic image of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism has long been reproduced and circulated in media and academic discourse. The remote and holy image, the spiritual construction of Shangri-la, has gained currency as a general image of Tibet and Tibetan people. Many exiled Tibetan lamas, most prominently the Dalai Lama, travel around Western countries propagating the spiritual value of the Tibetan religion as well as its predicament in its homeland. Therefore, a prime motivation for many Westerners visiting Tibet appears to be their desire to see and experience a peaceful, primordial and somewhat 'otherworldly' world, saturated by the sublime teaching of Tibetan Buddhism. Some also seem to be prompted to visit before the ongoing process of modernisation obliterates the religious purity they imagine exists there.",

What motivates Japanese tourists to visit Tibet is both similar to and different from Western motivations. As in the West, a seductive, spiritual image of Tibet is disseminated by the media. Japan's century-old study of Tibetology, as well as nonprofessional accounts on Tibet such as those of explorers (e.g. Kawaguchi, 1978) , are instrumental in reinforcing this exotic, spiritual image of Tibet and Tibetan people. However, another factor attracting Japanese to Tibet appears to be their disenchantment with Buddhism in Japan. Japanese Buddhism is regarded as inauthentic, commercialised and even corrupt by some Japanese, and Japanese religions have certainly undergone secularisation and modernisation during the last one-and-half century. Therefore, Japanese people visiting Tibet may be powerfully inspired by the search for a 'true' and 'living' Buddhism; a kind of national quest for their lost, pre-modern origins. During work as a 'Tibet Expert' accompanying Japanese tourists in Lhasa during 2005 and 2006, I noticed that many of them were self-consciously Buddhist yet dissatisfied with the teachings and practices of Japanese Buddhism. They were searching for a true, uncontaminated, pure Buddhism whose traces they claimed they had found during their visit to Tibet.",

These derogatory images are not explicitly expressed in the media but often articulated in daily contexts where Chinese and ethnic minorities intensively interact person-to-person, for example, in schools, workplaces and many other public places. Exploring these issues is not the purpose of this essay, but these negative images can probably be seen as not unrelated to the traditional Han Chinese self-image as urban, cultured and civilised (cf. Gladney, 1999; Schein, 2000; Harrell, 1995) . Within the general perception of the Han Chinese, Tibetans as 'ethnic Others' are exclusively attributed inferior characteristics and values which, in turn, operate to consolidate and validate Chinese orderliness and superiority. Due to both cultural remoteness and social proximity between the two nationalities, those 'Othering' practices are observable at both collective and individual levels.",

Thus, together with the negative discourses above, terms such as 'beautiful', 'enticing', 'pure' and 'sacred', have been used to refer to Tibet in both commercial and government representations. Particularly from the 1990s onwards -the period when China experienced unprecedented economic prosperity -China's ethnic areas became popular tourist destinations and, concurrently, the exotic image of Tibet was gradually accepted as currency. The Chinese toponym for Tibet, Xizang (literally meaning 'treasure house of the western region') began to spread a seductive aura over urban Chinese in developed eastern coastal areas.

The most popular of these was the global bestseller by Sogyal Rinpoche (a celebrated Tibetan lama in the West) entitled The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying (1994) , an adaptation of material discussed in The Tibetan Book of the Dead (trans. Evans-Wentz, 1974 [1927 ). The latter publication was hugely influential in forming Western fascination with Tibetan Buddhism (e.g. Bishop, 1989; Lopez, 1998) . Moreover, the successful inscription of the Potala as a World Heritage Site in 1994 resulted in the promotion of its national value for international and domestic audiences. The Potala Palace and Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) have now been sublimated into Tibet's ethnic icons, functioning as metonyms signifying its people and land as peaceful, pure and holy. Inspired by the Western imaginative construction of Shangri-la, the romanticised, exotic image of Tibet has now become an important component of Han Chinese perception of Tibet. The tremendous increase of domestic tourists to Tibet since 2000 is partly confirmation of this. Notably, a county in Yunnan Province formerly called Zhongdian, whose name was changed to Xiang-ge-li-la (a Chinese phonetic representation of Shangri-la) in May 2002, now enjoys a huge income from tourism (cf. Kolas, 2004) .",

On auspicious dates of the Tibetan traditional calendar Lhasa attracts many Buddhists, not only from neighbouring counties, but also from Tibetan-speaking regions beyond the national boundary.

Unlike in Southeast Asia or Nepal, tourism is a relatively new socioeconomic phenomenon for Tibetans. Apart from within a certain section of Lhasa's society (i.e. Tibetan elites, government officials and entrepreneurs), it is considered inappropriate to associate Tibetan Buddhism with mundane economic values and activities. In some contexts, it is even disrespectful and insulting for Tibetans to make such an association. However, it should be emphasised that economic practices and orientations relating to Buddhism did exist in premodern, traditional Tibet -and still do, for example in the form of economic activities related to pilgrimage. However, what is different from the previous era, what the development of tourism has brought, is the systematic introduction of economic value into the core of traditional Tibetan culture. The commodification of Tibetan religion is naturalised and authorised at the national level for the sake of social and economic progress. Tourism operates as a disseminating vehicle which encourages the Tibetans to re-examine their religious traditions; to consider them as commodifiable. Supporting this newly emerging economic movement is considered a Tibetan ethnic virtue, or even imperative, by the state. These ideas are repeatedly disseminated through a variety of state mechanisms: through local media, including newspapers and TV programmes; through government work units; through schools, universities and religious institutions; and through billboards and banners in the streets.",

Some Tibetans called these banners the 'Chinese tarcho', in a comparison with the five-coloured Tibetan tarcho -Tibetan prayer flags. Whereas Tibetan tarcho were hung in prayer, spreading Tibetan Buddhist teachings, the purpose of Chinese tarcho was, in their words, 'to pray for money'. For many local people, these red banners appear to have become a familiar part of their townscape. Although the slogans were somewhat abstract and so perhaps not able to fully capture people's attention, their overwhelming abundance was potentially effective in encouraging local people to appreciate the importance of tourism for Lhasa's economy.",

It is possible that these were targeting Chinese tourists in order to lend distinctive value to their journeys, but they also seemed to function simultaneously as a way of letting local Tibetans see their living space from a tourist perspective and taste. Through promoting Tibet as attractive and enticing, Lhasa Tibetans were encouraged to look at their homeland in a new way: Tibet as a hospitable place and its traditional culture as fascinating and exotic, which, as we can see, corresponds to a newly emerging Chinese fantasy about Tibet as 'Shangri-la'.",

Through the various state mechanisms such as education institutes and local media, including street banners, Tibetans were repetitively encouraged to pursue and maintain this emerging market. The crucial, underlying message of such propaganda is that Tibetan Buddhist values, Tibetan traditional culture and identity can be transformed into cultivatable economic capital.

This process involved the creation and enforcement of a new identity for those people. Through categorising and listing them as ethnic minorities (shaoshu minzu), they were symbolically incorporated into the constitution of the Chinese Nation (Zhonghua minzu) in which the vast majority are Han Chinese. To date, 55 ethnic minorities have been officially acknowledged and, in theory, the ethnic identification process is not yet complete. Each ethnic minority is usually represented as a discrete entity with its own folkloristic customs, such as distinctive costume, dance, music, culinary practices and belief systems. Framed by these markers, each ethnic minority is treated as a delimited cultural bearer. Colourful and exotic images are flamboyantly proliferated and circulated in media and socialist discourse. Objectified ethnic symbols are reproduced and regulated according to a state standard, and the people labelled as 'ethnic' are encouraged (or sometimes forced) to become associated with these bounded traditional symbols. The endowment of ethnic status, in a sense, may be less motivated by egalitarian considerations than with confining the non-Han people within China's national imaginings.",

As is the case in many other parts of the world, it seems that tourism plays an instrumental role in reinforcing and consolidating ethnicisation in Tibet. In this political process within the tourism discourse, the Tibetan culture tends to be represented in such a way that its religious aspects are deemphasised or relegated to a merely symbolic realm (as also discussed by Bovair in this book). While Tibetan Buddhist images and tropes proliferate in the townscape and local media, the traditional centrality of the Buddhist culture, in contrast, tends to be played down or overtly ignored in various tourism discourses. In the local media and most tourist documents in China, phrases such as Tibetan Buddhist culture or Tibetan religious tradition seem to be deliberately avoided. Instead, Tibetan ethnic culture is predominantly employed as the most common idiom, quite often together with some eulogising terms such as excellent (youxiu) or splendid (canlan), for example, 'excellent Tibetan ethnic culture'. The secular aspects of Tibetan tradition such as artefacts, dance, food (e.g. butter tea and roasted barley) and courtesy (e.g. offering a white scarf to a guest or a respected person) tend to be exclusively elaborated. Within the tourism discourse, Tibetan Buddhism has been, by and large, relegated simply to a flavour of 'Tibet-ness'. In contrast, the aesthetic or folk aspects of Tibetan tradition have been highlighted, brought to the fore as representative of authentic Tibetan culture.",

Tourism may be a primary vehicle for this. The representative mode of Tibetan culture has increasingly been naturalised and taken as more real than the reality itself (cf. Eco, 1986) within the discursive discourse of cultural representation. Importantly, it seems that this economic process has been exploited by the state in order to manipulate and redefine Tibetan culture through employing specific national signs and markers in which the language of ethnicity (minzu) plays a significant role. The semiotic power of tourist representation has been harnessed in order to circulate, legitimate and naturalise this state label of minzu, and its superiority over religious elements. It can be argued, then, that Lhasa's tourism discourse provides the national space wherein Tibetan culture has become ethnicised through its tourist representations, during which process those representations have become imbued with aesthetic character, being cleansed from 'contamination' by backward traditional elements considered to have originated from a Buddhist legacy.",

This may be particularly so in the case of ethnic tourism. Since the development of tourism may potentially stimulate nationalistic or separatist sentiments among the ethnic population, it is often observed that the state engages in systematic controls over its various marketing processes, particularly the ideological aspect of its development. In Lhasa what is repetitively propagated in the tourism discourse is twofold: the economic value of Tibetan traditional culture, and that culture as ethnic, rather than as religious or Buddhist. The semiotic logic of tourism seems to be harnessed to reinforce both the commodification and the ethnicisation of Tibetan culture. The state manipulation of Tibetan tradition (or ethnic signs), and the attempt to redefine (and even de-centre) substantial Buddhist components is observable behind the ostentatious celebration of 'excellent ethnic culture'. The intended targets of this type of propaganda are not only Chinese and overseas tourists but also, more crucially, the Tibetan people themselves, whether they are involved in the tourism industry or not. Thus, it may be said that, at the ideological level, tourism in Tibet operates as a capitalist-driven socialist propaganda confining the Tibetan people within a marked tradition and identity as ethnic objects serving to constitute the Chinese Nation (Zhonghua minzu). This chapter has touched on some political aspects of the development of tourism, while sketching general tourist motivations to visit Tibet. There are many other important issues to be explored, such as the influence of tourism on the preservation and restoration of Tibetan religious culture and its effect in widening economic disparity between Tibetans and Han Chinese, or between urban and rural Tibetans. Such types of research avenues are valuable ones to explore in the interests of both the local people and the policy-makers. For the facilitation of productive research, however, it may be indispensable that Tibet opens (kaifang) itself to the outside world in a more tangible manner.",
