            "text": "Background: Healthcare workers caring for patients with high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs) require protection from pathogen exposure, for example by wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Protection is acquired through the inherent safety of the PPE components, but also their safe and correct use, supported by adequate training and user familiarity. However, the evidence base for HCID PPE ensembles and any associated training is lacking, with subsequent variation between healthcare providers. Aim: To develop an evidence-based assessment and training tool for evaluating PPE ensembles and doffing protocols, in the assessment of patients with suspected HCIDs. Methods: VIOLET (Visualising Infection with Optimised Light for Education and Training) comprises a healthcare mannequin adapted to deliver simulated bodily fluids containing UV-fluorescent tracers. On demand and remotely operated, the mannequin projectile vomits (blue), coughs (red), has diarrhoea (yellow) and is covered in sweat (orange). Wearing PPE, healthcare staff participate in an HCID risk assessment and examination of the 'patient', thereby becoming exposed to these bodily fluids. Contamination of PPE is visualized and body-mapped under UV light before and after removal. Observational findings and participant feedback, around its use as a training exercise, is also recorded. Findings: Significant contamination from different exposure events was seen, enabling evaluation of PPE and doffing procedures used. Observational data and participant feedback demonstrated its strengths and success as a training technique. Conclusion: Simulation exercises using VIOLET provide evidence-based assessment of PPE ensembles, and are a valuable resource for training of healthcare staff in wearing and safe doffing of PPE.",

An example of simulation that has expanded greatly in recent years is the use of ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence markers, well established as a means of assessing compliance with hand hygiene, but also for assessing contamination of the environment and equipment [15e22] . Their value in assessing PPE and user competence, especially for HCID pathogens, is increasingly recognized, with visualization of cross-contamination providing strong and instant feedback to users. However, these studies have low numbers of participants.

A representative volume was placed in the mannequin's underwear and incontinence pad before each simulation exercise started. e Sweat: Glycerol was considered a suitable simulant for sweat, mixed with an orange UV tracer (UV Gear Ltd) and manually applied to the skin of the mannequin immediately before starting each exercise. Although the viscosity differs from that of human sweat, it was acceptable for the purpose of this exercise, staying in place after application without 'pooling' or dripping off, yet transferring well on contact as determined by prior testing. e Cough: Both aerosol and droplet spread of particles are potential routes of respiratory infection transmission such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and so the aim was to replicate both [3] . Advice was sought from an aerosol physicist about cough velocity, droplet/aerosol mix and spread, concluding that a commercially available artist's airbrush delivered an acceptable simulation, and could be adapted to fit into the mannequin's lower jaw (Figure 2b) . A similar approach has previously been used to mimic a cough/sneeze in respiratory protection challenge studies using a breathing mannequin [28] . The airbrush reservoir was filled with an aqueous solution of a red UV tracer (UV Gear Limited) and activated remotely to spray into the zone the healthcare worker would enter during the patient care scenario.",

However, their use is technically more complex and lacks instant visual results. For example, using UV markers facilitated timely, simple and comprehensive screening of equipment, identifying unexpected cross-contamination such as glove boxes. This would not have been possible in near-realtime with a viral surrogate. Reassuringly, work using both methods showed no difference in rates of contamination events on healthcare workers, suggesting that both are suitable for PPE assessment. Furthermore, in the absence of minimum infecting dose of HCID pathogens through cross-contamination, presence or absence of contamination is the valid basis of safety assessment [6, 20, 38] . Using qualitative fluorescent markers therefore provides an evidence base for real-time training. Compared to using an actor as a 'patient' as in other studies, using the VIOLET mannequin made it possible to standardize each bodily fluid exposure [9, 24] . Despite concerns that using a mannequin adds an artificial element, volunteers engaged with the scenario, and were observed to perform human interactions such as holding her hand or rubbing her back after she coughed. As some volunteers were used more than once, the travel and exposure histories were changed between days to try and overcome volunteer fatigue.",
