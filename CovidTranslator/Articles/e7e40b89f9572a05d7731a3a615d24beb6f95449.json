Microbiol., A dot blot hybridization assay was developed for use as a rapid screening test to detect bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in serum from infected cattle. A 1.1. kilobase cDNA, prepared from the BVDV genome, was molecularly cloned and used in this study. Insert cDNA was removed from the pUC9 plasmid vector by Pst-I restriction endonuclease digestion and purified from plasmid DNA by agarose electrophoresis and electroelution. The hybridization probe was prepared by nick translation in the presence of gamma dCT32p and labelled to a specific activity of 2 \u00d7 108 cpm/#g of DNA. Specificity was determined by dot blot hybridization of infected cell culture supernate from nine different BVDV strains. The probe hybridized equally with all strains of BVDV tested, which included four cytopathic and five noncytopathic strains of BVDV. Serum was collected from veal calves with respiratory tract disease, unthriftiness, anorexia, and/or poor conditions. Serum samples were treated with nonidet P40 detergent and denatured with formaldehyde and heat prior to application on 1.2 micron nylon membrane filters using a vacuum dot blot apparatus. Hybridization was done under relatively stringent conditions (50% formamide at 42\u00b0C). A total of 141 serum samples from different calves were tested and of these samples, 55 (39%) were positive by dot blot hybridization for BVDV RNA. Eight calves (33%) out of 24, tested 3 to 4 weeks later, remained positive for BVDV RNA.",

            "text": ". Transplacental infection is a common sequel in persistently-infected cattle or after BVDV infections in susceptible, pregnant heifers and cows (Orban et al., 1983; Liess et al., 1984) . The virus is fetopathic, primarily early in pregnancy; however, fetal infections may result in persistent immunotolerant infections in postnatal life (Duffel and Harkness, 1985; Harkness, 1987) . Such animals may appear to be healthy but some die pre-maturely, often after chronic illness, and all have the potential of developing mucosal disease (Orban et al., 1983; Liess et al., 1984; Duffel and Harkness, 1985 ) . Evidence indicates that mucosal disease is precipitated by superinfection of persistently-infected, seronegative animals with a different strain of BVDV and thus represents the final outcome of in utero infection (Lies et al., 1984) . Another significant repercussion of in utero infection is that persistently-infected cattle may be the primary source of BVDV in nature (Harkness, 1987) . Novel approaches for identifying persistently-infected animals are required since methods currently employed are inefficient, expensive and of questionable accuracy (Coria et al., 1984; Howard et al., 1985 ) .",

Hybridization was allowed to proceed at 42 \u00b0C for 16-24 h.

Therefore, samples taken 7 to 10 days after infection may be negative for virus by isolation in cell culture but positive by hybridization. The preferred sample for isolation of BVDV from infected animals is white blood cells (buffy coat) from heparinized whole blood instead of serum (Bezek et al., 1988 ) . Also, virus isolation may not have correlated with hybridization results due to insufficient detection of some antigenically-heterologous field strains of BVDV by the anti-BVDV antibody used in the indirect fluorescence antibody assay (Castrucci et al., 1975; Coria et al., 1984) . Also it may be possible that antibody present in FBS used to supplement cell culture interfered with the isolation of BVDV.",

            "text": "The disparity between the hybridization results and virus isolation would suggest the hybridization probe is reacting nonspecifically. However, several factors support the specificity of the hybridization probe for BVDV. The hybridization probe consisted only of insert DNA removed from plasmid DNA by restriction endonuclease digestion and electroelution to prevent nonspecific reactions by plasmid DNA. Control pUC9 plasmid DNA did not hybridize with the BVDV hybridization probe and probe prepared from pUC9 plasmid DNA alone did not hybridize with samples identified as positive with the BVDV hybridization probe. The hybridization probe has previously been used against several bovine RNA and DNA viruses (bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bluetongue virus, bovine coronavirus, and bovine herpesvirus I ) without any cross-hybridization (Brock et al., 1988 ) . The possibility that the probe reacts nonspecifically with a factor in bovine serum samples is not probable. Hybridization results of serum samples taken from a different population of 575 steers and bulls identified only five animals that were positive by hybridization using identical assay conditions (unpublished data). Assuming comparable results, if random nonspecific reactions occur, more positive animals would have been expected. Also in this study, initial samples collected from some animals were positive and following the second sampling 3 to 4 weeks later, the samples taken from the same animals were negative. One animal was negative from the first sample taken and positive on the second sample by hybridization. Another important factor in the evaluation of the assay results was the definition of the positive endpoint of the dot blot hybridization assay. In this study, samples that had an equal intensity of hybridization signal compared with the positive control dots of BVDV-infected cell cultures were considered positive for BVDV RNA by hybridization (Fig. 1 ) . The variability in the hybridization signals was likely due to the varying amounts of BVDV RNA present in the samples. Hybridization of some samples resulted in low level signals below the intensity of the controls and were considered negative although virus may have been detectable by virus isolation (Fig. 1 ) . Although the hybridization probe can detect a minimum quantity of 10 to 20 pg of BVDV RNA (Brock et al., 1988 ) , the evaluation of hybridization results from clinical samples at this low threshold level is difficult and impractical as a diagnostic assay. The use of polymerase chain reaction technology to amplify the template in the samples may improve definition between positive and negative signals when a minimum amount of BVDV RNA is present.",

CONCLUSION Dot blot hybridization can be used to detect BVDV in serum from cattle naturally-infected with BVDV. The hybridization assay is extremely sensitive and specific for detection of BVDV RNA.
