In addition to directly causing a temporary but complete shut-down of the commercial aviation system, the attacks caused many travelers to reduce or avoid air travel, weary of a newly-perceived risk associated with flying. Likewise, following September 11, many businesses put temporary freezes on all but the most essential travel for their employees. 1 And although the initial \"panic\" driven fear of flying immediately following September 11 appears to have largely dissipated, the stringent new security requirements that were implemented as a direct result of the terrorist attacks have made traveling by air more cumbersome and time-consuming than prior to September 11. 2 The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of September 11 on U.S. airline demand and to determine whether or not September 11 and its after-effects have resulted in a negative shift in the demand for air travel.",

            "text": "Since , numerous airlines (both in the U.S. and abroad) have been experiencing a financial crisis unlike any in modern aviation history. While United Airlines and US Airways have already filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, many other large U.S. carriers have engaged in dramatic cost-cutting programs. The prospects for (or lack of) a recovery in passenger demand has been the primary issue in the minds of aviation industry leaders and policymakers alike. In this paper, we investigate the form and extent of the downturn in demand for domestic air travel following . While there is little doubt that September 11 and its after-effects resulted in industry turmoil in the days and months directly following the attacks, there is controversy regarding the longer term impact of September 11 on the airline industry. This controversy arises due to the fact that weak economic conditions (particularly in the labor market) pre-dated and have largely persisted since Although the airline industry has always been highly cyclical, it has traditionally been able to weather through temporary economic downturns. The impact of September 11 on airline demand has been so severe, however, that demand still remains well below pre-attack levels more than 2 years after the attacks. Our research purpose is to measure the magnitude of this ongoing shift in demand by disentangling it from both the immediate downward spike following the terrorist attacks (resulting from factors such as the temporary shutdown of the aviation system and the initial panic driven fear of flying) as well as economic cycle effects. Measuring the magnitude of the ongoing demand shift is important for three reasons. First, since the terrorist attacks, there have been and continue to be numerous arbitrations between airlines and their labor unions related to the impact of September 11 on airline demand. Since many airline labor contracts expressly prohibit laying off employees due to weak economic conditions (i.e., recessions), determining both the initial and ongoing impact of the September 11 terrorist attacks has important ramifications on labor negotiations within the industry. In particular, many contracts between airlines and their unions have \"no furlough\" clauses that prohibit layoffs except in the case of extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the airline, known as force majeure events. Second, in the weeks and months leading up to September 11, one of the primary concerns of aviation policymakers was airport and air traffic control congestion and delays. 3 and Mayer and Sinai (2003) . the ongoing impact of September 11 on airline demand is important for aviation capacity planners. Finally, to the extent that the demands for air travel has spill-over effects into other sectors of local economies (Button, Lall, Stough, & Trice, 1999) , the impact of lower demand for air travel has much broader economic effects than those impacting solely the airline industry.",

One exception is Rupp, Holmes, and DeSimone (2004) , which studies airline schedule recoveries following airport closures since September 11. 4 Our basic methodology is to estimate a reduced form model of demand for domestic air services using monthly time-series data since 1986. After controlling for cyclical, seasonal and other unique events impacting the industry, we model the post-September 11 period using an attenuating shock process that has both a transitory component as well as an ongoing (as of November 2003) component. After controlling for factors such as trend, seasonality and general macroeconomic conditions, we find that the events of September 11 led to both an initial demand shock of more than 30% as well as an ongoing downward shift in the demand for commercial air service of roughly 7.4%. We estimate that this ongoing demand shock accounts for over 90% of the current weakness in domestic airline demand relative to its pre-September 11 peak.",

It is well known that the demand for commercial airline service is both seasonal and cyclical. Thus, an integral part of our analysis of the effects of September 11 requires that we effectively control for seasonal, economic and other unique factors that are known to have impacted the demand for air service. After controlling for these factors, we should be able to assess the degree to which the current industry malaise is related to September 11 and its after-effects.

A revenue passenger mile is defined as one paying passenger traveling one mile. that prior to September 2001, industry demand has been steadily trending upwards. Fig. 1 also highlights a number of notable events that have impacted the U.S. airline industry since 1980, such as the air traffic controller's strike that started in August 1981 and culminated with the firing of over 11,000 controllers. 5 Likewise, the 1991 Gulf War and ensuing recession resulted in an industry-wide decline in RPMs for roughly 11 months (compared to the same months of the previous year), after which point RPMs resumed their upward trend.",

            "text": "Although Fig. 1 illustrates that the U.S. airline industry has faced a number of negative demand \"shocks\" throughout its history, airline demand-as measured by industry RPMs-has proven to be quite resilient and most negative shocks have dissipated (on an industry-wide basis) within a relatively short period of time. However, there are a number of reasons to suggest that September 11 and its aftermath may have imposed a more lasting impact on the demand for airline services. First, September 11 likely caused more consumers to be unwilling to fly because of an increased fear of flying. Another significant factor impacting demand has been the increased security measures that have made traveling by air post-September 11 more time-consuming and far less convenient than before the terrorist attacks. This effect, often referred to as the \"hassle factor\" has been especially noticeable on the demand for short-haul trips. If the current weak demand for air services were solely related to cyclical factors, one would expect that the decline in passengers, by distance, would assume a fairly uniform pattern. Fig. 2 demonstrates, however, that the drop in demand for domestic air service has been most pronounced in short-haul (less than 500 mile) markets, where increased elapsed travel times due to tighter security have made travel by alternative means such as driving or taking the train relatively more attractive following September 11. As trip distance increases and traveling by air becomes the only viable form of transportation for most travelers, the percentage decline in O&D passengers pre-and post-September 11 moderates substantially. And while the 26% drop in the less than 250 mile segment is likely also a result of weakened economic conditions (as a high proportion of passengers flying 250 miles or less tend to be business travelers on one-day trips), it is important to emphasize that such a dramatic decline in short-haul traffic is unprecedented. For example, we also compared two similar periods prior to and during the 1991 Gulf War and ensuing recession and found that the decline in trips of 250 miles or less only decreased by 10.5%. Moreover, the percentage decline across all other flight distances was largely uniform.",

The ongoing component 5 The 1981 strike was unlike other labor disruptions among air traffic controllers in that President Reagan issued a directive prohibiting the FAA from re-hiring any of the fired controllers. This directive remained in effect until August 12, 1993. 6 O&D passengers count travelers based on the starting and ending point of their journey, regardless of whether or not they make a connection. We compare these two time periods because the year ending June 2003 represents the most recent data available from the Department of Transportation's DB1A quarterly database of O&D passengers. Likewise, the year ending June 2001 represents the last four quarters of data unaffected by the events of September 11. (i.e., a downward shift in demand) attempts to capture both the post-September 11 \"hassle\" factor as well as an increased reluctance to fly based on concerns of further terrorist attacks (i.e., an increased fear of flying). We characterize such changes as \"ongoing\" since they are likely to persist at least until there have been significant improvements in the efficiency and perceived effectiveness of the passenger screening and security systems. The transitory component, in contrast, attempts to capture the relatively short term \"panic\" or uneasiness with air travel that kept many passengers from flying in the weeks and months directly following September 11, but have now-for many passengers subsided. Separating the persistent and ongoing components of the September 11 shock is the key component of our empirical analysis we develop in the next section.",

Firstly, we use the national unemployment rate as our business cycle indicator. Secondly, we use the domestic labor force to control for the long-term growth of the overall economy. 11 While we recognize that gross domestic product is the standard variable for measuring economic activity and its fluctuations, GDP statistics are only available on a quarterly basis, which is not sufficient for our analysis. 12 Fig. 3 plots the national unemployment rate from 1986 to 2003. After reaching historically low rates in 2000 and 2001, Fig. 3 demonstrates that the onset of the economic downturn is readily apparent prior to September 2001.

Numerous researchers have studied various economic effects of September 11 (i.e., Garner, 2002; Hobijn, 2002; Virgo, 2001) . Moreover, it has been well documented that at least some mass layoffs following September 11 (especially those in the travel and tourism industries) were directly attributable to the terrorist attacks rather than prevailing economic conditions. 13 Determin- 11 We also experimented with the level of non-farm employment as our macroeconomic variable, which yielded similar results. However, employment figures embody not only trend, but also cyclical fluctuations. Consequently, we elected to use two separate variables to account for them. 12 We also experimented with average weakly earnings as a measure of business cycles. But, the results were not much different from those obtained with the unemployment rate. 13 For example, in the 18 weeks following September 11th, employers reported 430 mass layoff (i.e., greater than 40 employees) events related to 9/11 to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ing aggregate job losses at the national level attributable to September 11, however, is almost impossible, since there are literally thousands of small firms whose layoffs would not be recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thus, for the purpose of our analysis, we do not attempt to differentiate between the sources of job losses (i.e., general economic conditions versus September 11). Consequently, to the extent that September 11 was directly or indirectly responsible for higher levels of national unemployment, our estimation results will underestimate September 11s' impact on airline demand.",

However, the September 11 attack was a long-lag event, making the first different estimation problematic. Moreover, pinning down the precise dynamics of September 11 is not our main research focus.

Since 1986, there have been 30 fatal airline accidents involving U.S. scheduled commercial carriers-excluding the September 11 terrorist attacks-including one known terrorist attack (the Pan-Am Lockerbie bombing in December 1988). It is reasonable to expect some travelers to experience increased apprehension of flying, especially when there have been accidents involving a large number of fatalities. We include a variable that measures the number of fatalities on U.S. carriers in order to control for the generic demand impact of airline accidents. If fear of flying from the September 11 terrorist attacks is comparable to that from other fatal accidents, we expect this variable to pick up the generic fear effect. However, it is possible that travelers reacted more strongly to the potential for greater \"systematic risk\" since September 11 than the \"idiosyncratic risk\" inherent with air travel.",

We allow for the possibility of an ongoing downward shift in demand by including an dummy variable, D post911 that takes the value 0 for all observations before September 2001 and 1 thereafter.

The decline in RPMs is approximately 7.4% while the yield decline was 10.0%. The negative impacts on both the quantity (RPMs) and price (yields) indicate that 9/11 resulted in a negative demand shift, rather than a supply contraction. Moreover, the estimated effect of the ongoing demand shift remains almost the same even after we isolate the September 2001 observation from the remainder of the data in Model 2. Thus, these results do not appear to be the outcome of one influential observation. If we assume the estimated coefficients reflect a pure demand shift, which, as discussed earlier, is consistent with the simulta-neous decline in both quantity and price-the implied elasticity of the airline supply is 0.74.",

Such a protracted recovery, however, would also be unprecedented in the airline industry. For example, we applied our model to the 27 months following the invasion of Kuwait and subsequent 1991 Gulf War and found no evidence of a negative demand shift.",

Put differently, domestic RPMs reached a historical peak in August 2001 of approximately 46.0 billion miles and dropped precipitously to 24.7 billion miles in September 2001, then recovering to 31.4 billion miles in October 2001.

While the benchmark model accounts for 89 and 83% of the variations in the RPMs and yield, respectively, the improvements in fit from Model 1 are substantial. For the RPMs equation, the residual sum of squares are reduced by 74.7% and for the yield equation, the reduction is 60.4%.

While the U.S. airline industry has typically recovered from other negative shocks considerably faster than 27 months, a catastrophic event such as September 11 could obviously require a longer recovery period. If this is the case, we are still observing the recovery. Based on the data, one cannot rule out the possibility that we are still on the recovery trajectory from September 11, especially when events such as the Iraq War and the SARS epidemic have put additional downward pressure on the demand Fig. 6 .

Moreover, our macroeconomic indicator variables, the labor force and unemployment rate, will tend to overstate the impact of the negative economy on airline demand relative to other variables such as GDP.

This controversy arises due to the fact that weak economic conditions pre-dated, and persisted, past September 11, 2001. Our analysis attempts to disentangle these macroeconomic effects on airline demand from the more direct effects of the September 11 terrorist attacks. In addition, our analysis separates the effects of September 11 into its effects temporary and ongoing components. In summary, we find that September 11 resulted in both a transitory, negative demand shock of more than 30% in addition to an ongoing negative demand shift of approximately 7.4% that cannot be explained by cyclical, seasonal or other factors. Moreover, we estimate that this structural demand shock accounts for over 90% of the current weakness in domestic airline demand relative to its pre-September 11 peak.",
