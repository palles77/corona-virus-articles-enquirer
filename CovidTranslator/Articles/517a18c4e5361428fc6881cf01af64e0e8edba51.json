This extends the range of MERS-CoV further west in Africa than reported to date and cautions that MERS-CoV should be considered in cases of severe respiratory disease in the region.",

While it is suspected that MERS-CoV originated in African bats [3] , contact with camels is associated with primary human infections. Serological evidence demonstrates that MERS-CoV (or serologically related viruses) have been present in camels in the Middle East and parts of Africa for over 30 years. Studies have found that a high proportion of camels from Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Jordan [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] have antibodies against MERS-CoV. This suggests that widespread exposure to MERS-CoV among camels has been ongoing for an extended period of time. In contrast, serum from other animals that are common in the Middle East including sheep, goats, cattle and horses has not been found to contain antibodies that are reactive to MERS-CoV [7, 8] . Infectious virus has also been isolated from nasal swabs of camels in some of these regions [10, 11] .",

Subsequent analysis of neutralizing activity of the sera from the Nara camels revealed no neutralization titers in a microneutralization assay, further supporting their lack of reactivity (Fig. 1B) . At the lowest dilution tested in the MERS-CoV S1 ELISA (1:400), nearly all samples assayed (88%) were positive for antibodies that react to S1. While the positivity decreased with increasing dilution, 70% and 67% of samples respectively were positive at 1:1600 and 1:6400 (Table 1 ). Even at a dilution of 1:25,600, 24% of samples remained positive. There was no variation in seropositivity between different sampling locations in Kidal province (Fig. 1A) . In terms of seropositivity and approximate endpoint dilution, there were no notable differences when animals were categorized by age or sex. When camels were grouped by age (1-2, 3-8 and 9-16 years) neither the seropositivity rate (83, 91, 88%) nor the endpoint dilution were significantly different. Similarly, the seropositivity rate in male (n = 245) and female (n = 328) camels of 86 and 92% respectively was comparable. A small number (n = 10) of serum samples from Malian cattle and sheep were also tested in the S1 ELISA but consistent with reports from other countries [8, 13] were negative. To confirm data from the S1 ELISA, as subset samples (n = 147) were assayed for neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV in a microneutralization assay.

The camels in Kidal province are used for transport and frequently cover vast distances, interact with other animals, and are actively traded. A subset of these samples was from military camels that provide transport over most of the northern region of Mali. Camels from the Kidal region are also frequently used for transportation to trading posts in Algeria, highlighting the need for further studies in neighbouring countries. In contrast, the dromedary camels in Nara were used exclusively on a farm and it is assumed that they did not leave the farm. Based on the currently available data, camels in the Middle East and in every country in Africa where sampling has been performed have high rates of exposure to MERS-CoV or MERS-CoV-like viruses. So far only studies of camels in Kenya, Tunisia and the Canary Islands have reported less than half of the camels in the study positive [5, 6, 14] . Only dromedary camels from central Asia (Kazakhstan) [15] and Australia [16] appear to not have evidence of exposure to MERS-CoV in samples tested to date.",

Thus it seems likely that most regions of Africa with large camel populations that are not geographically isolated will have been exposed to MERS-CoV. This is remarkable given that there has yet to be a confirmed locally acquired human MERS-CoV case identified in Africa, likely due to lack of diagnostic resources and previous lack of general awareness. It is also possible that transmission requires some environmental or activity-based conditions that are more prevalent in the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia, than in Africa. A serosurvey of human populations in African countries with high numbers of camels would be valuable, as would heightened surveillance for undiagnosed severe respiratory disease. Additionally, sampling of camels for isolation and characterization of viruses would be useful to determine the similarity of viruses circulating in Mali compared to the viruses from the Middle East.",
