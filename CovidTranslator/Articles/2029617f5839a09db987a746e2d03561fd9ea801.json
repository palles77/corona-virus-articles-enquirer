Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three SARS-CoV proteins: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5 fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3 fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5 tree could be rejected for the 3 region, and the optimal 3 tree could be rejected for the 5 region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1-3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals. The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3 RDRP fragment of SARS-CoV suggests an additional host-species shift. Demonstration of recombination in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.",

To date, group 3 coronaviruses have been found only in birds, group 1 coronaviruses have been found in carnivores, cetartiodactyls and primates, and group 2 coronaviruses have been found in cetartiodactyls, perissodactyls, rodents, and birds. Previous phylogenetic analyses, all of which were unrooted, suggested that SARS-CoV represents a relatively early diverging coronavirus lineage equally distantly related to the three groups of coronaviruses noted above. On this basis, SARS-CoV was proposed as representing a fourth, distinct group within the genus Coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . These previous studies, which focused on characterizing and sequencing SARS-CoV, did not yield evidence for recombination within the SARS-CoV genome, although Marra et al. (2003) commented that the s2m motif within the SARS-CoV UTR may be the product of horizontal transfer, given the disjunct presence of s2m in many if not all astroviruses, a picornavirus (ERBV) and only one group 3 coronavirus (avian infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV)).",

This approach is analogous to bootscanning (e.g. Salminen et al., 1995) , however, we use Bayesian inference rather than neighbor joining (NJ) and amino acid sequences rather than nucleotides. For BI, four chains were run for 200 K generations with a 100 K generation burn-in using a \u2425 distribution of rates and the transition matrices WAG for S and N, and rtREV for RDRP (Dimmic et al., 2002) in MrBayes v.3b4 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001 ) and summarized as a 50% majority rule consensus tree. We used the differential phylogenetic position of different SARS-CoV gene fragments ('windows') with respect to other coronavirus groups to identify potential recombination breakpoints and to divide the alignment into segments for additional phylogenetic analyses ( Fig. 2A for RDRP) with BI and NJ bootstrap. For the analysis of these segments, BI parameters were as above, except each chain was run for 1 million generations. For NJ bootstrap, we used 1000 bootstrap replicates and NJ searches under default parameters in PAUP*, summarized as a 50% majority rule consensus tree.",

As shown in Fig. 2 , the optimal sister relationship for the 5 region, with SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including groups 1-3 combined, is rejectable for the 3 region, and the optimal sister relationship for the 3 region, with SARS-CoV sister to group 3, is rejectable for the 5 region. Additionally, SARS-CoV RDRP as sister to group 1 RDRP is rejectable in both regions, and SARS-CoV as sister to group 2 is rejectable in the 3 region. To assess the impact of the outgroups on these results, we repeated the AU tests with only the 12 coronavirus taxa. All alternative topologies for both regions were rejectable in favor of the optimal topology according to the AU test.",

We say 'ancient' to denote that both regions are sister to clades of other sequences, rather than to any single recently diverged sequence. These results indicate that the two SARS-CoV RDRP regions do indeed represent two unique histories. Thus, it is preferable not to analyze them together, as has been done in previous analyses (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) because their history cannot be represented by a single tree. These previous analyses used distance methods (NJ) less able to accommodate heterogeneity in rates of sequence character change, and found RDRP as a whole to be closest to group 2 coronaviruses. This may result from conflicts within the data stemming from recombination and/or from effects of rate heterogeneity. The authors do not report whether alternative trees could be rejected based on their analyses of multiple genes, though it seems unlikely, as when we performed similar analyses for the S and N proteins we were not able to differentiate between alternative SARS-CoV sister relationships using the AU test. We note that the approach for detecting recombination implemented here is rigorous in comparison to traditional bootscanning, in that it analyzes more conserved amino acids using Bayesian inference rather than NJ, and explicitly tests the significance of alternative topologies using the AU test. It is possible and likely that more recombination events have happened within RDRP, N, S or other SARS-CoV genes, than we have detected here, although the evidence for recombination generally becomes more difficult to discern over time. Murphy et al., 2001 for mammals) . Lines drawn between the two phylogenies indicate the host status of each coronavirus. For the nucleocapsid phylogeny, all nodes are supported by >50% Bayesian posterior probability. Nodes overlaid with circles are also supported by >75% of neighbor joining bootstraps. GenInfo identifiers for the proteins used in this analysis: 1220375, 395178, 127872, 11096193, 543643, 3132999, 1515361, 21624372, 222585, 29840828, 13448682, 28916465, 281107, 74863, 28460530, 11640712, 29836503, 14253137, 1515365, 1515367, 6689852, 6689856, 320020, 1515375, 1515373, 1515371, 331869, 547999, 21624295, 21624366, 21624369, 28932648, 28932650. Inclusion of an outgroup, as we have done with RDRP from 15 Arteriviridae taxa (Fig. 1) , allows inference of the sister relationships and the relative age and timing of Coronaviridae (Coronavirus and Torovirus) divergence events, missing from the previous unrooted analyses which only could assess distance between clades. Our rooted analyses indicate that the 5 RDRP fragment diverged from other Coronavirus taxa prior to divergences between and within groups 1-3. Fig. 1C indicates that the 3 RDRP fragment diverged from other coronavirus homologs more recently, after divergences between and within groups 1-3. Interestingly, Fig. 1C also shows non-monophyly for group 1 coronaviruses. This is not surprising, given that groups 1-3 were initially distinguished based on serological tests rather than phylogenetic analyses and given the capacity for recombination.",

They may have even been incorporated concomitantly, perhaps on transmission from an ancestor of IBV, the only coronavirus with s2m (Jonassen et al., 1998) . As the 5 region of RDRP and the s2m motif are disjunct in the SARS-CoV genome, putative replication-dependent recombination would have involved several consecutive template switches, as was inferred for the transfer of s2m to IBV (Jonassen et al., 1998) .

Coronavirus genomes generally appear resilient and able to tolerate deletions, insertions and rearrangements (de Haan et al., 2002) . Similar to our findings, Decimo et al. (1993) suggested that N genes from murine hepatitis viruses were the result of double recombination, and several authors have reported evidence for recombination among natural isolates of IBV (e.g. Jia et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1993) . Recombination can be important in gain of novel functions. For example, in HIV recombination is considered to be a powerful adaptive mechanism for antiviral agent resistance and cytotoxic T-cell escape (e.g. Morris et al., 1999) .

            "text": "Despite the limitations imposed on inference of historical host association by the restricted sampling of hosts and coronaviruses to date, some preliminary observations can be made. Coronaviruses have been shown to be particularly host specific (Lai, 1990; Sturman and Holmes, 1983) and it had been assumed by some that they coevolved (diversified in tandem) with their hosts (Decimo et al., 1993) . However, based on current sampling and analyses summarized in Fig. 3 , some host switching events are implicated in accounting for incongruence between the host and coronavirus phylogenies. For example, chicken and turkey are sister taxa within the host phylogeny, yet isolates from each do not form host-specific monophyletic groups. Rather, some isolates from chicken are most closely related to turkey isolates, suggesting host-shifts for coronaviruses between these two bird species (Fig. 3) . A third avian species, the manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) is the host to a group 2 coronavirus (Kirkwood et al., 1995) , which are otherwise known only from mammals. The phylogenetically nested position of this avian coronavirus within mammalian-host isolates suggests a possible bird-mammal host-shift. Coronavirus host-shifts between mouse and rat are implicated in the same manner as for chicken and turkey; isolates from the two rodent species are not reciprocally monophyletic. Similarly, isolates from pig are not monophyletic, including two group 1 and one group 2 coronavirus in Fig. 3 . With the outbreak of SARS, coronavirus isolates from humans are also non-monophyletic.",

Inclusion of additional host and virus sampling in Fig. 3 , including two iso-lates from dogs, implicates potential host-shift between dogs and pigs, rather than cats and pigs. This demonstrates sensitivity to sampling, although the implication of host-shifting as a phenomenon remains. The emerging picture of coronavirus host associations is increasingly indicative of host-shifts. This is supported in Fig. 3 by the observations mentioned above as well as (1) the sister relationship between human coronavirus 229E and porcine (pig) epidemic diarrhea virus and (2) non-monophyly for human coronavirus 229E and SARS-CoV. Further, according to statistical tests in TreeFitter, allowing host-shifts to occur results in significant fit while duplication, codivergence and sorting play no detectable role. Depending on the assigned costs, TreeFitter estimates between 9 and 15 host-shifts in reconciling the host and coronavirus phylogenies shown in Fig. 3 , though the actual number is unknown. In light of the genomic disparity among diverse coronaviruses from some individual host-species (e.g. humans, pigs), it seems unlikely that increased sampling of coronaviruses will yield monophyly for all isolates from each of the individual host-species in Fig. 3 .",

Demonstration of recombination in the SARS associated coronavirus lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development. The known non-human coronaviruses come from only nine, mostly domestic, mammal or bird species, and searches for the zoonotic reservoir might reasonably focus on other species, including non-domesticated animals, that are used as food for humans in the geographic region of the SARS outbreak.",
