In this Review , we describe new insights into how ISG15 directly inhibits viral replication and discuss the recent finding that ISG15 modulates the host damage and repair response, immune response and other host signalling pathways. We also explore the viral immune-evasion strategies that counteract the actions of ISG15. These findings are integrated with a discussion of the recent identification of ISG15-deficient individuals and a cellular receptor for ISG15 that provides new insights into how ISG15 shapes the host response to viral infection.",

Ubiquitin and Ubls are involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular activities, including protein stability, intracellular trafficking, cell cycle control and immune modulation. Whereas some Ubls are constitutively present in the host cell, others are induced by different stimuli. ISG15 and the members of the enzymatic cascade that mediate ISG15 conjugation (ISGylation) are strongly induced by type I interferons 3 . ISG15 can be covalently conjugated onto target proteins via an enzymatic cascade, yet the fate of these modified proteins is still largely unknown. In addition, ISG15 exists as an unconjugated protein that has been reported to function as a cytokine and can also interact with various intra cellular protein partners. Progress has been made in defining some of the mechanisms by which ISGylation of both viral and host proteins inhibit viral replication and the viral evasion strategies that have evolved to circumvent ISG15, yet recent advances in the field have highlighted the complexity of this pathway. There is increasing evidence that unconjugated ISG15 can regulate viral replication and host responses through both non-covalent protein interactions and its action as a cytokine. Human genetic evidence from ISG15-null patients has revealed the importance of ISG15 in the regulation of the type I interferon response 4 . ISG15-null patients display type I interferon autoinflammation and no apparent increase in susceptibility to viral infection, as compared with ISG15-deficient mice, indicating functional diversity between species 5 .",

However, for every ISGylated protein studied, only a small fraction of the total pool of a protein is modified by ISG15, making it a challenge to understand how ISGylation can impact the overall function of a protein. One possibility is that modification of a protein alters its cellular localization and function, as was seen with the ISGylation of filamin B 23 .

Fig. 1 | The ISG15 conjugation pathway. a | Induction of ubiquitin-like protein ISG15. The expression of ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 and members of the ISG15 conjugation pathway is strongly induced by type I interferons (IFNs). Upon type I interferon stimulation, interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) interacts with phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 and forms the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, which recognizes the interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE) promoters of ISG15 and its conjugation enzymes to induce their expression. During chronic viral infection, both IFN\u03b2 and type III interferons lead to the formation of an unphosphorylatyed ISGF3 (U-ISGF3) complex, which is composed of IRF9 and unphosphorylated STAT1-STAT2 (refS 127,128 ), to induce the expression of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including ISG15 (ref. 89 ). Additional stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), foreign DNA or RNA , retinoic acid and DNA-damaging agents, are also able to induce the expression of ISG15. LPS was shown to induce ISG15 expression via TIR domain-containing adapter protein inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF; also known as TICAM1)-IRF3 signalling pathways, but this stimulation still functioned in a type I interferon-dependent manner 129 . Retinoic acid can also induce ISG15 expression through its induction of type I interferons 14, 130 . By contrast, the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) could induce ISG15 expression via IRF3 in an interferon-independent manner 131 . IRF3 forms a complex with CREB-binding protein (CREBBP)/p300 and binds to the ISRE elements to induce ISG15 expression 132, 133 . Bacterial DNA can also induce ISG15 expression independent of type I interferon and can signal through a cytosolic surveillance pathway that requires stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7 (ref. 12 ). Notably , the expression of ISG15 and its conjugation enzymes is controlled by the ISRE elements, mediated by various IRFs. However, a recent study found that ISG15, as well as its conjugation enzymes, including ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 homologue (UBE1L), ubiquitin/ISG15-conjugating enzyme E2 L6 (UBCH8) and E3 ubiquitin/ISG15 ligase TRIM25, possess cellular tumour antigen p53-responsive elements in their promoters 134 . DNA-damaging (for example, ultraviolet light or doxorubicin 134 ) or agents (for example, camptothecin 15 ) induce p53, which binds to these p53-responsive elements to transactivate the ISG15 pathway. b | The ISG15 conjugation pathway. ISG15 is initially expressed as a 17 kDa precursor protein that is then processed into its mature 15 kDa form via protease cleavage 11, 16 . Conjugation of ISG15, commonly referred to as ISGylation, utilizes a three-step enzymatic cascade similar to that of ubiquitination. The activating E1 enzyme UBE1L functions only in the ISG15 pathway 135, 136 , forming an ATP-dependent thioester bond with ISG15 (ref. 137 ). Following activation, ISG15 is transferred to the active-site cysteine of the ubiquitin/ISG15-conjugating enzyme E2 L6 (UBCM8) (in mouse) and UBCH8 (in human) 138, 139 . Finally , an E3 ligase facilitates the conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins. Although several enzymes, including E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ARIH1 and TRIM25, have been found to act as E3 ligases within the ISG15 pathway 140, 141 , human HERC5 (mouse HERC6) appears to be the dominant E3 ligase that coordinates the conjugation of the majority of substrates to ISG15 (refS 91, [142] [143] [144] [145] ). However, during DNA-damage responses (DDRs),TRIM25 also serves as a p53-specific ISG15 E3 ligase 134 . Notably , its corresponding E2 enzyme for ISG15 conjugation has not been identified. HERC5 associates with polyribosomes and appears to target newly synthesized proteins, including viral proteins and many interferon-induced proteins 54 . ISGylation is also reversible via the specific removal of ISG15 from conjugated proteins by the deconjugating enzyme Ubl carboxy-terminal hydrolase 18 (USP18) 24, 25 . cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; ER , endoplasmic reticulum; HCV, hepatitis C virus; IFNAR1, interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 1; IFNAR2, interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 2; IFNLR1, interferon-\u03bb receptor 1; IL-10R2, interleukin-10 receptor subunit 2; JAK1, Janus kinase 1; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene I; ssDNA , single-stranded DNA ; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4. fig. 4 ). However, recent findings have challenged the notion that the dominant function of ISG15 is as an antiviral protein that directly inhibits viral replication. First, Isg15 \u2212/\u2212 mice are not susceptible to all viruses, and even for virus challenge experiments in which Isg15 \u2212/\u2212 mice have increased lethality, it is not always due to increased viral replication 31, 50 . As discussed below, ISG15 can regulate cytokine responses 31 and the host damage and repair response 50 . In addition, ISG15 has been shown to regulate cellular processes that include autophagy 40,41,51 and metabolism 52 . Regulation of these processes could indirectly affect the outcome during viral infection. Second, the identification of ISG15-null patients who have a type I interferon autoinflammatory condition and, to date, no increased susceptibility to viral infection raises questions as to whether ISG15 is an essential antiviral molecule (reviewed in ref. 45 ) (box 1). This phenotype is in contrast to Isg15 \u2212/\u2212 mice that do not display type I interferon autoinflammation 53 , indicating that ISG15 may have divergent functions between different species. These observations increase our understanding of the ISG15 pathway but must also be taken into consideration when interpreting future studies on ISG15. For the remainder of this Review, we explore our understanding of the mechanism by which ISG15 regulates viral replication and the host response in both mice and humans.",

Several immunomodulatory and cytokine functions have been ascribed to ubiquitin-like protein ISG15. Although it does not possess a leader signal sequence to direct its secretion, ISG15 has been found to be released through microparticles 146 , exosomes 35 and neutrophilic granules 5 ; from secretory lysosomes 36 ; and via apoptosis 36 . It has been described as influencing the functions of several different types of cells. Natural killer (NK) cells: ISG15 induces NK cell proliferation 32 and stimulates interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) production 5 . Dendritic cells (DCs): ISG15 induces DC maturation and upregulates the expression of E-cadherin, CD15 and CD86 (ref. 33 ). Neutrophils: ISG15 functions as a chemotactic factor and an activator of neutrophils 34 . T cells: ISG15 was found to induce the secretion of IFN\u03b3 147 . Macrophages: ISG15-containing microparticles and exosomes have been found to stimulate macrophages to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines 146 and mediate anti-HIV activity 35 , respectively. It remains to be determined whether it is a stand-alone effect of ISG15 or an effect synergistic with those of other molecules in the secretory vesicles. Lung epithelium cells: recombinant ISG15 reduces CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) protein production in human rhinovirus-16 (HRV-16)-infected human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells 148 . ISG15 receptor: lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1; also known as \u03b1L\u03b22 integrin, or CD11a/CD18) was recently identified as a cell surface receptor for extracellular ISG15. Binding of ISG15 to LFA1 on NK cells stimulated the release of IFN\u03b3 and interleukin-10 (IL-10) from IL-12 primed NK cells 37 . Whether LFA1 senses extracellular ISG15 in other cell types remains to be determined. b | Intracellular functions: Ubl carboxy-terminal hydrolase 18 (USP18) and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2): USP18, which is induced by type I interferons, mediates the negative feedback regulation of interferon signalling independent of its deISGylase activity. USP18 is recruited by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT2) and binds to interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor 2 (IFNAR2) of the interferon receptor complex, displacing Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and suppressing interferon signalling and the downstream expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) 149 . Notably , human ISG15 binds to USP18 and inhibits SKP2-mediated ubiquitylation and proteasomal-mediated degradation 4,114 . In the absence of human ISG15, human USP18 is degraded, and this allows for continued JAK1 binding to the IFNAR2 complex and prolonged IFNAR signalling and ISG expression 26 . By contrast, mouse ISG15 does not alter the stability of mouse USP18 and its ability to suppress IFNAR signalling, although the precise reason for this difference is still unclear, as discussed in box 1 (ref. 53 ). Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and ubiquitin-binding protein p62 (also known as SQSTM1): intracellular ISG15 binds to HDAC6 and p62 to regulate autophagic clearance of proteins, especially ISGylated proteins 40 . Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 25 (LRRC25)-retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I)-p62: intracellular ISG15 binds to LRRC25, p62 and RIG-I to mediate the autophagic degradation of RIG-I, which is critical to LRRC25-mediated downregulation of type I interferon signalling 41 . Hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1): ISG15 has been shown to interact with HIF1\u03b1, preventing its dimerization with HIF1\u03b2 to initiate downstream gene expression. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase NEDD4: ISG15 has been shown to bind to the NEDD4 and disrupt its interaction with ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzymes, preventing ubiquitin from being transferred to NEDD4 for ubiquitylation. The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of NEDD4 is critical to Ebola virus-like particle virus budding 39,69 . HBMECs, human brain microvascular endothelial cells; MACs, macrophages.",

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, the most common HIV/ AIDS-associated cancer worldwide. Transcriptional analysis of KSHV-infected primary human oral fibroblasts identified a series of strongly induced ISGs, including ISG15. Knockdown of ISG15 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in these latently infected cells increased the expression of viral lytic genes and increased virion release, implicating ISG15 in the maintenance of KSHV latency 74 . One proposed mechanism for this was through the regulation of specific KSHV microRNAs that are known to modulate KSHV latency 74 . In a second study, KSHV infection was reactivated in primary effusion lymphoma cells by various means, and both ISG15 and ISG15 conjugate levels were found to be increased, along with activation of the type I interferon system 75 . Knockdown of either ISG15 or the E3 ligase HERC5 resulted in an increase in KSHV reactivation and an increase in the production of infectious virus 75 .

            "text": "The unconjugated form of ISG15 has also been shown to counteract the inflammatory response during viral infection. During chikungunya infection, neonatal mice lacking ISG15 were found to be more susceptible to viral infection; however, this protection was independent of UBE1L-mediated ISGylation, and the increased lethality observed in the Isg15 \u2212/\u2212 mice was not due to an increase in viral titres 31 . Instead, the infected Isg15 \u2212/\u2212 mice developed an exaggerated immune response, displaying a significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared with wild-type or Ube1 \u2212/\u2212 mice 31 . Preliminary data indicate that death of the animals occurred in a manner that is consistent In general, the viral replication cycle consists of the following steps: attachment, entry , uncoating, viral replication complex formation, transcription, translation, post-translational modification and processing of viral proteins, packaging, capsid assembly , egress and trafficking, assembly and budding, release and virion maturation. Ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 was found to restrict the infection of murine norovirus at the virus entry or uncoating step 150 . This inhibition was conjugation-dependent, but the precise mechanism is still unknown. Viral DNA or RNA replication: many studies of the antiviral activity of ISG15 analysed the replication of viral DNA or RNA in the presence or absence of ISG15 and its conjugation machinery. During IBV infection, ISG15 disrupts the viral replication machinery through conjugation to the viral nucleoprotein (NP), disrupting its ability to oligomerize and form viral nucleoproteins (vRNPs), thus inhibiting viral RNA synthesis 62 . In addition, the replication of many viruses (blue) was inhibited by ISG15 (refS 48,50,64,79,85,88,92,98,151-155 ), yet the precise mechanisms by which ISG15 inhibits their replication remain unclear. During chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (green), ISG15 appeared to have a proviral role 86,87 because its overexpression reduced the responsiveness of the cell to interferon-\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1) by maintaining the abundance of Ubl carboxy-terminal hydrolase 18 (USP18), a negative regulator of type I interferon receptor signalling 89 . In post-translational modification and processing, ISG15 conjugation has been shown to target newly synthesized proteins, including viral proteins and several interferon-stimulated genes during the type I interferon response 54 . ISGylation of viral proteins acts as a host antiviral strategy. ISGylation of such proteins elicits antiviral effects by impairing their function, for example, essential effectors of viral replication complex (influenza B virus (IBV) NP 62 and influenza A virus (IAV) NS1/A 55 ), proteins involved in host shut-off (coxsackie virus 3 (CVB3) 2A protease (2APro) 48 ), counteractors of host immunity (human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pUL26 (ref. 64 )) and capsid proteins (human papilloma virus (HPV)-16 L1) 54 . Egress and trafficking and assembly and budding: both ISG15 and ISG15 conjugation have been shown to restrict intracellular trafficking of viruses and/or subsequent viral release from the cell surface 65,72 , mostly by targeting host proteins necessary for trafficking (for example, tumour susceptibility gene 101 protein (TSG101) 66 ) or for release and/or budding (for example, ubiquitin protein ligase NEDD4 (refS 39,69 )) and preventing their interactions with either viral proteins or members of the host transportation complex 65,73 . Viral release: for specific viruses, ISG15 was found to modulate the amount of released infectious viral particles while intracellular viral replication remains intact. Interestingly , whereas the molecular mechanism is unclear, such effects can be either antiviral (for example, dengue virus 2 (DENV-2)) 156 or proviral (for example, hepatitis B virus (HBV)) 157 depending on the type of virus. Viral latency: ISG15 was also shown to maintain viral latency and prevent reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection via the regulation of specific KSHV microRNAs 74, 158 with a cytokine storm, and the survival of Isg15 \u2212/\u2212 mice could be prolonged when they were treated with TNF\u03b1-blocking antibody before infection 76 . In a separate study, ISG15-deficient mice were more susceptible to vaccinia virus infection and produced elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (ref. 77 ). Taken together, these findings suggest that unconjugated ISG15 negatively regulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during certain viral infections. It is still unclear whether these effects are mediated by intracellular or extracellular unconjugated ISG15 and which cell types are responsible for the increased cytokine production.",

Initially, three patients with inherited ISG15 deficiency were found in Turkey and Iran 5 . They clinically presented with a mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease 5 . The initial analyses supported the hypothesis that these individuals had reduced levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) upon bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine challenge owing to a lack of extracellular ISG15, which had been previously shown to act as a cytokine to stimulate IFN\u03b3 production 5 . In vitro experiments using fibroblasts derived from these individuals demonstrated that such defects could be partially rescued by recombinant ISG15 or fully recovered by a combination of ISG15 and interleukin-12 (Il-12). In a second study, three individuals with ISG15 deficiency were identified in China 4 . These individuals presented with seizures and had intracranial calcifications, a phenotype seen in patients with Aicardi-gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS), in which various mutations result in enhanced type I interferon production. In vitro characterization using cells isolated from these individuals showed elevated type I interferon levels and hyperresponsiveness to type I interferon stimulation, including prolonged signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 phosphorylation 4 . This hyperresponsive phenotype was similar to that previously observed in Usp18 \u2212/\u2212 mice 113 . Indeed, individuals lacking ISG15 expressed lower levels of ubl carboxy-terminal hydrolase 18 (uSP18), which was rescued by complementation with either wild-type or a non-conjugatable form of ISG15 (ref. 4 ). ISG15 was shown to bind to and prevent uSP18 degradation mediated by S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2)-dependent ubiquitylation 4,114 . Therefore, in the absence of ISG15, uSP18 is ubiquitylated and degraded, and an important negative regulator of type I interferon receptor signalling is lost. Notably, neonates with uSP18 deficiency were also recently identified and were found to die soon after birth owing to the dysregulation of type 1 interferon responses 115 . Together, these findings indicate that ISG15 has an important role in the regulation of the type 1 interferon response.",

This finding raises questions as to why mice lacking ISG15 have a substantial increase in susceptibility to viral infection. A subsequent analysis of cells derived from ISG15-deficient mice and humans demonstrated that, unlike human ISG15, which can bind to human uSP18 and prevent its ubiquitylation and subsequent SKP2-mediated degradation, mouse ISG15 was not able to stabilize uSP18 (ref. 53 ). Biochemical experiments indicated that this was due to an inability of mouse ISG15 to bind to uSP18 (ref. 53 ). However, a recent study solved the crystal structure of mouse ISG15 in complex with uSP18, which suggested that the sites of interactions are well conserved among several species, raising questions as to why these mouse proteins do not stably bind to each other in in vitro biochemical experiments 25 .

IRF3 is a transcription factor that, once phosphorylated, moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to form a complex with CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) and activates the transcription of IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2 and additional ISGs. STAT1 is a member of the STAT protein family and functions as a transcription factor involved in the upregulation of genes induced by type I, II and III interferons. During SeV infection, IRF3 is ISGylated, and this inhibits the interaction between IRF3 and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1), preventing the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of IRF3 (ref. 79 ). Similarly, STAT1 is ISGylated in human cells 82 , which was found to maintain the levels of phosphorylated, activated STAT1 and downstream signalling. In both cases, the result of ISGylation is a more robust interferon response that limits viral replication. Recent studies of individuals with inherited ISG15 deficiency who displayed signs of type I interferon autoinflammation 4,5 (box 1) revealed that intracellular unconjugated ISG15 has immunomodulatory functions. In vitro characterization of cells isolated from these patients showed elevated type I interferon secretion and a hyperresponsiveness to type I interferon stimulation, including prolonged STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation. This was attributed to the low level of USP18 protein expression in these cells 4 . This defect could be restored by either wild-type or non-conjugatable ISG15, implicating non-covalent interactions between ISG15 and USP18. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that ISG15 binds to and stabilizes USP18 by preventing its ubiquitylation by S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) 4 ( fig. 2) . These results suggest that human intracellular unconjugated ISG15 is crucial for USP18-mediated downregulation of type 1 interferon signalling during viral infections. Consistent with this, human ISG15-deficient cells primed with interferons displayed prolonged ISG expression, which in some cases provided resistance to viral infection 53 .

The expression of ISG15 and members of its conjugation cascade was found to be upregulated in individuals persistently infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who had failed treatment with IFN\u03b1 [85] [86] [87] . Consistent with this, in vitro studies also showed that knockdown of ISG15 increased the sensitivity of HCV-infected cells to IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b1-ribavirin therapies 87, 88 . Mechanistic studies found that ISG15 expression was induced under these conditions by unphosphorylated interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (U-ISGF3) 89 ( fig. 1 ). U-ISGF3 is a tripartite transcription factor composed of interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and unphosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2. The level of U-ISGF3 is significantly increased in response to IFN\u03bb and IFN\u03b2 during chronic HCV infection and sustains the expression of ISG15 and a subset of ISGs, which restricts HCV replication. The sustained ISG15 expression led to stabilization of USP18 levels, which decreased signalling through the type I interferon receptor 84, 89 . Therefore, the regulation of interferon signalling that is mediated by ISG15 contributes to the maintenance of chronic HCV.",

To overcome this, HCMV has evolved multiple countermeasures. The major immediate-early protein IE1 reduces ISG transcription by sequestering STAT2 and preventing interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE) binding. Ectopic expression of HCMV IE1 limited ISG15 protein conjugation, presumably through the decreased expression of components of the ISG15 conjugation machinery, such as HERC5 (ref. 108 ). An IE1 deletion virus robustly induced interferon signalling, including the expression of ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates 64 . In addition, p21 and p27, two tegument proteins encoded by the gene pUL26 that are involved in virion stability and downregulation of NF-\u03baB signalling, non-covalently interact with ISG15, UBE1L and HERC5 (ref. 64 ). The expression of UL26-p21 reduced the levels of ISG15 conjugates in cells co-transfected with ISG15 and the conjugating enzymes. Interestingly, as discussed earlier, pUL26 itself is a target of ISG15 conjugation. ISGylation of pUL26 alters its stability and inhibited its ability to suppress NF-\u03baB signalling. In the absence of pUL26, HCMV growth is more sensitive to IFN\u03b2 treatment. KSHV vIRF1. ISG15 conjugation limits KSHV replication and modulates viral latency 74, 75 . KSHV vIRF1 protein, which is expressed upon Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation and interferon induction, interacts with ISG15 E3 ligase HERC5. Interaction between vIRF1 and HERC5 decreased the levels of TLR3induced ISG15 conjugation and cellular IRF3, suggesting that vIRF1 affects ISG15 conjugation and the interferon response, which could contribute to effective KSHV replication 75 .",

Recent studies have advanced our understanding by elucidating how ISG15 antagonizes viral replication during acute and latent infections; identifying immune-evasion strategies; beginning to characterize how ISG15 alters disease pathogenesis, including its ability to limit tissue damage and to modulate human type I interferon signalling; and identifying the first cell surface receptor for unconjugated ISG15, which can regulate cytokine release. The recent identification of ISG15-deficient patients 5 and the subsequent characterization of ISG15 regulation of type I interferon signalling have shed light on the complexity of this pathway and have prompted a re-evaluation of the role of ISG15 (ref. 4 ). There are still many important questions that will need to be answered for this pathway to be fully understood.",

How ISGylation modulates viral proteins, viral replication and host homeostasis is still poorly understood. The ISG15 conjugation system has been intimately tied to protein translation, but it also results in the targeted modification of proteins, as outlined above. How the modification of a small fraction of the total pool of a protein can affect its overall function within a cell is still unclear. Possibilities include the ability of ISGylated proteins to disrupt oligomerization of proteins or to alter the cellular localization of proteins. Another intriguing possibility is that ISGylation could serve as a warning sign to the cell that it is infected. Recent studies have shown that ISG15 can interact with the autophagy pathway, which is known to regulate a variety of processes, including protein degradation, antigen presentation, cytokine signalling and cell death 40,41,51 . ISGylated proteins, through their interaction with autophagy pathways or other cellular pathways yet to be determined, could function as a danger signal, activating host responses that could serve to limit the infection and protect the host. The application of novel proteome analyses 12,109 will be crucial for determining the conjugation preference, scope and potential biological outcomes of protein ISGylation. Although initial proteomic studies to identify ISGylated proteins have been performed in interferon-stimulated cells, this analysis will need to be expanded to different cell types and viruses.",

Fig. 4 | Viral immune-evasion strategies targeting the ISG15 pathway. Viral immune-evasion strategies have been identified that target the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 pathway. Certain viruses, for example, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 64,159 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) 160,161 , suppress the expression of ISG15 at the transcriptional level. Vaccinia virus E3L 92 and HCMV pUL26 (ref. 64 ) proteins bind to ISG15 to inhibit ISG15 conjugation by undefined mechanisms. HCMV pUL26 (ref. 64 ), influenza A virus (IAV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1)55  and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1)75 also interact with an E3 ISG15-protein ligase HERC5 to reduce protein conjugation by ISG15. Even when the viral and host proteins are conjugated to ISG15, viruses have also developed strategies to deconjugate or sequester ISGylated viral proteins. Influenza B virus (IBV) NS1 protein counteracts ISG15 antiviral activity by sequestering ISGylated viral proteins, particularly viral nucleoproteins (NPs), to prevent their incorporation into NP oligomers, thus disrupting viral RNA synthesis 62 . Several virus families encode enzymes possessing deISGylase activities, including papain-like protease (PLpro) of coronaviruses and viral ovarian tumour domain (OTU) proteases of nairoviruses and arteriviruses, to remove ISG15 from conjugated proteins93 .
