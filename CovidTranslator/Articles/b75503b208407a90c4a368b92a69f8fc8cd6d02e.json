            "text": "Estimating the true burden of influenza is problematic because relatively few hospitalisations or deaths are specifically coded as influenza related. Statistical regression techniques using influenza and respiratory syncytial virus surveillance data were used to estimate the number of excess hospitalisations and deaths attributable to influenza. Several International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) groupings were used for both hospitalisation and mortality estimates, including influenza and pneumonia, other respiratory disorders, and circulatory disorders. For Australians aged 50-64 years, the annual excess hospitalisations attributable to influenza were 33.3 (95%CI: 23.2-43.4) per 100,000 for influenza and pneumonia and 57.6 (95%CI: 32.5-82.8) per 100,000 for other respiratory disorders. For Australians aged \u226565 years, the annual excess hospitalisations attributable to influenza were 157.4 (95%CI: 108.4-206.5) per 100,000 for influenza and pneumonia and 282.0 (95%CI: 183.7-380.3) per 100,000 for other respiratory disorders. The annual excess all-cause mortality attributable to influenza was 6.4 (95%CI: 2.6-10.2) per 100,000 and 116.4 (95%CI: 71.3-161.5) per 100,000, for Australians aged 50-64 years and those aged \u226565 years, respectively. In the age-group \u226565 years, a significant association was found between influenza activity and circulatory mortality. We conclude that influenza is responsible for a substantial amount of mortality and morbidity, over and above that which is directly diagnosed as influenza in Australians aged \u226550 years.",

One of the simplest methods involves calculating the excess disease burden which occurs during periods of influenza activity over that occurring in baseline periods (i.e. periods when influenza is not circulating) [3, 9, 10] . However, results derived from this method may be inaccurate if other seasonally variable causes of disease are not considered. More complex statistical techniques are required to account for other seasonal variables and to assess the proportion of the excess disease burden that is attributable only to influenza. Two commonly used methods are Serfling-type models [11] [12] [13] [14] and Poisson regression models [15] [16] [17] . While there is debate around strengths and weakness of the various statistical approaches [18] [19] [20] [21] , these two approaches can produce similar estimates when applied to the same time-period and population [19] .",

LabVISE is a national system of sentinel laboratories which analyses specimens all year round. In 2005, there were 11 participating laboratories from all states and territories except Western Australia and the Northern Territory [24] . LabVISE data were supplied from January 1997 to June 2005. In Australia RSV activity has been known to overlap with influenza activity (Fig. 1) . Internationally, previous models have shown that RSV (like influenza), while often undiagnosed, is responsible for significant mortality [15] . As in previous models estimating influenza disease burden [15] [16] [17] RSV activity was included as a covariate in the model. By including RSV activity in the model, the deaths (or hospitalisations) attributable to RSV are accounted for, and should not be confounded with deaths from influenza.",

However, they could also be the result of methodological differences in the models used, for example, Thompson et al. utilised weekly virological data, whereas this study utilised monthly data [15] . While weekly data may provide a more powerful method of estimating influenza-attributable disease, it also increases issues associated with time delays between influenza activity and influenza mortality.

No significant association between influenza activity and circulatory hospitalisations was found in either age-group. The lack of association with circulatory hospitalisation is consistent with data from other studies [4] .

            "text": "The model utilised in this study assumes that variation in influenza laboratory reports accurately reflect patterns of circulation in the population of interest. However, there are several limitations in the laboratory data used. Firstly, variation in laboratory testing patterns in Australia may not be consistent over time or place. This variation could result in an ascertainment bias, due to variation in the number of tests ordered. Unfortunately, denominator data for all tests of respiratory viruses is not available in Australia at present. Secondly, due to small numbers of laboratory reports, all-age influenza activity was used, rather than age-specific laboratory reports. Other causes of respiratory infection (such as rhinovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus or parainfluenza virus) may also peak annually, and by disregarding these agents, the influenza-related disease burden could be overestimated. However, proxy seasonal variables were used in the model to account for annual fluctuations that were independent of influenza and RSV. Without these proxy variables significantly more deaths and hospitalisations were attributable to influenza.",

The majority of the disease burden occurs in the elderly. However, the disease burden attributable to influenza in those aged 50-64 years suggests that a significant reduction in hospitalisation and mortality may be achieved through an effective influenza vaccination program targeted at this age-group.",
