The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020.",

More specifically, these studies have reported the most common symp toms, incubation periods, biological abnormalities, radio graphic abnormalities, CT abnormalities, and treatment data. In addition, they have described varying degrees of illness and their severity: mild, severe, or critical. They have reported proportion of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, or case fatality rates, and variables associated with these complications and death. 1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In this Article, through a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy, we report the clinical and biological features of the first five cases of confirmed COVID-19 in Europe, which occurred in France, and their dynamics in parallel with changes in their viral load, based on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection.",

All patients at French hospitals who were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to the French National Health Agency criteria were enrolled in this cohort from Jan 24 to Jan 29, 2020. 5 Together with the French National Regulatory authorities and French Ministry of Health, on Jan 25, 2020, we determined the indication criteria for compassionate use of an investigational antiviral treatment (remdesivir) as signs of severe illness at diagnosis or secondary clinical aggravation (respiratory symptoms or general signs) based on WHO criteria for severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 10 (appendix p 2). On the basis of expert opinion and available data in January, 2020, we considered that remdesivir might be the best potential drug for the treatment of COVID-19, although restricted to patients with severe disease (intravenous route, a loading dose of 200 mg, then maintenance daily dose of 100 mg for a total duration of 10 days). Criteria for discharge with total recovery were from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines: asymptomatic patients with two RT-PCR negative naso pharyngeal samples at least 48 h apart. 11 The five patients in this case series, at different stages of infection, include two patients with a mild disease at admission and a secondary worsening that resulted in their admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), one initially severely ill patient directly admitted to an ICU for an acute respiratory failure, and two patients with a mild disease diagnosed very early after infection.",

The study also brings to the field some new and original findings by including patients at different stages of infection (ie, at very early stages or later in the course of the disease) and through a detailed and comprehensive sampling strategy; patients enrolled early being contacts of patients enrolled later during the course of the disease. To our knowledge, the association between clinical evolution and the virological dynamic has not been reported in the past. It allowed us to describe three patterns: paucisymptomatic patients diagnosed very quickly over their disease course, with an early high nasopharyngeal shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5\u00b72 and 7\u00b74 log 10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively); patients with a two-step disease progression, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and a patient with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma (ie, an old patient).",

The implication is that COVID-19 control measures should combine immediate isolation of cases after symptom onset together with a rapid screening and monitoring of the contacts of infected patients. In patients with severe disease, two patterns were identified. The first pattern was a biphasic evolution starting with a mild presentation followed by a secondary respiratory worsening despite a decreasing viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples, suggesting that the lung damage at this phase is more related to immunopathological lesions. The second pattern, observed in the most severely ill patient who died, was a persistent and high viral excretion in the upper respiratory tract samples combined with a positive virus detection in other body fluids including blood. These findings will contribute to better understanding of the natural history of the disease and in tailoring treatment strategies.",

Upper and lower (when possible) respiratory tract samples, and also blood, urine, and stool samples (or rectal swabs, if appropriate) were obtained. Upper respiratory samples were either nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasopharyngeal swabs (Sigma Virocult, Medical Wire Instrument, Corsham, UK), stool samples were either faecal swabs or stools, and blood samples were EDTA tube adapted for RT-PCR. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to the laboratories of the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where procedures for RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR), and virus isolation and titration were undertaken. RNA extraction was done with the Extraction NucleoSpin Dx Virus kit (Macherey Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany) or by the automated NucliSENS easyMAG (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcyl'\u00c9toile, France), using the manufacturers' instructions. RdRp-IP1 and RdRp quantitative rtRT-PCR (appendix p 4) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The RdRp RT-PCR corresponds to the Charit\u00e9 protocol. 14 When a sample (respiratory samples, plasma, or stool) was positive with RdRp-IP1, quantification of the number of RNA copies was done according to a scale ranging from 10\u00b3 to 10\u2076 copies per \u03bcL. The viral load in stools was calculated as previously described 15 and expressed in number of RNA copies per g of stool. The quality of nasopharyngeal swabs was checked using the CELL Control r-gene kit (bioM\u00e9rieux). This kit is provided with quantified plasmid for cellular quantification. All viral loads for respiratory samples were calculated with the same method as for stools 15 and normalised according to the cellular quantification as the number of RNA copies per 1000 cells. All positive plasma samples were quantified ",

He subsequently developed multiple organ failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, liver failure, and sepsis-like shock. After the COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed on Jan 28, he was transferred to the referent ICU at Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris, where broad-spectrum antibacterials were started for a possible superinfection. Remdesivir was started with a loading dose. As two pathogens were identified, a susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (multiplex PCR, confirmed by tracheal aspirates culture) and an Aspergillus flavus (tracheal aspirates culture), the anti-infective treatment was adapted. We treated A baumanii with meropenem, tigecycline, and colimycin followed by meropenem and levofloxacin. We initially treated A flavus with voriconazole but switched to isavuconazole because voriconazole and remdesivir both contain sulphobutylether\u03b2-cyclodextrin, and the safety of this association has not been evaluated yet. Remdesivir was discon tinued on Jan 30 because the patient needed renal replacement therapy. CT scan on Jan 31 showed a bilateral pleuropneumopathy including pleural effusion, alveolar condensations, ground-glass opacities, and pulmonary cysts. On Feb 5, because of the severity of the disease and persistence of viral detection, and as the risk-benefit assessment was considered favourable, remdesivir was reinitiated. Multiple organ failure persisted despite appropriate treatment against A baumannii and A flavus and no other superinfection was identified. The patient died on Feb 14 (illness day 24).",

Her cough, which was initially mild, increased transiently over time; she was asymptomatic from Feb 4 (illness day 8) without any specific treatment, and was discharged on Feb 17. Patients 4 and 5 had nasopharyngeal samples collected within the first 24 h of illness onset, allowing an early diagnosis of COVID-19. These early specimens had a high viral load, enabling whole-genome virus sequencing and virus isolation (table 2). The maximal normalised viral load obtained in their respiratory specimens were at 5\u00b72 log 10 copies per 1000 cells for patient 4 and 7\u00b74 log 10 copies per 1000 cells for patient 5 (based on the RdRp quantitative rtRT-PCR). This viral load in respiratory samples decreased over time (figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR was negative on illness day 12 for patient 4 and on illness day 16 for patient 5 (figure 2). These patients also had a positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stools, with viral load as high as 6\u00b78 log 10 copies per g of stool for patient 4 and 8\u00b71 log 10 copies per g of stool for patient 5. However, the virus was not detected in the serum or the urine samples. Patient 1 had nasopharyngeal samples collected at illness day 6 and patient 2 on day 9, which were positive by rtRT-PCR, with a SARS-CoV-2 viral load of 7\u00b71 log 10 copies per 1000 cells, and detected but not quantifiable viral load, respectively. The whole-genome virus sequence was obtained by direct sequencing for patient 1 only; virus isolation was unsuccessful in both cases. The secondary evolution to severe disease in these two patients (days 10 and 11) was not correlated to any viral load increase (figure 2). Both received intravenous remdesivir when the viral load had already decreased below the detection threshold. During the whole course of the disease of these two patients, SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR was negative in stools, serum, and urine. At illness day 6, patient 3 (whose disease was classified as critical) was positive by RT-PCR in both a nasopharyngeal sample and bronchoalveolar lavage, with cycle threshold values for the E gene target (Charit\u00e9 protocol 14 ) of 30\u00b73 and 27\u00b74, and similar cycle threshold values for the house-keeping gene GAPDH of 25\u00b77 and 24\u00b77, respectively (table 2). The SARS-CoV-2 titres in the nasopharynx were stable (from 6\u00b77 to 4\u00b74 log 10 copies per 1000 cells) over time, although with a trend towards decrease after the first intravenous remdesivir dose, and thereafter when remdesivir was reinitiated ( figure 2) . This patient had a RNAaemia on illness day 8 and subsequently, with a low viral load (detected but below the quantification limit). During the course of the disease, he developed a pleural exudative effusion, with SARS-CoV-2 detection positive in the pleural fluid and negative bacterial cultures. Figure 3 illustrates the kinetics of the viral load in nasopharyngeal samples of all patients after disease onset. The viral load decreased over time and became negative between illness day 9 and 14 in four patients (patients 1, 2, 4, and 5). In the most severely ill patient (patient 3), nasopharyngeal virus detection persisted until death.",

By contrast with the previous pattern, this persistent high viral load suggests the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 to evade the immune response. Indeed, we can speculate that, as shown during Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS coronavirus infections, 21,22 SARS-CoV-2 might be able to inhibit the interferon signalling pathways, resulting in higher respiratory virus load, positive viraemia, and eventually poor prognosis, as for MERS-CoV. 23, 24 Indeed, the 80-year-old patient, unlike the other cases, had evidence of high viral replication in the respiratory tract and evidence for systemic virus dissemination beyond the respiratory tract, with virus detection in plasma and pleural effusion fluid. The impaired immune response might have facilitated the bacterial and fungal superinfections. Patients with similar, severe patterns (sustained viral RNA in the respiratory tract and detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood) have also been reported in China. 6 As reported in previous studies, 12, 25 severely ill patients are often older patient with comorbidities.

Among potential candidates, remdesivir is an antiviral prodrug (nucleosidic analogue family) that has broad-spectrum in-vitro and invivo activity against numerous RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In animal models, compared with lopinavir plus ritonavir combined with interferon beta, two other potential candidates, remdesivir more significantly reduced the virus titre of mice infected with the MERS-CoV and decreased the lung tissue damage. 26 Remdesivir treatment improved disease outcomes and reduced viral loads in SARS-CoV-infected mice 27 and is inhibitory for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. 28 A phase 3 clinical trial assessed this drug for the treatment of Ebola virus infection; therefore, data exist for the safety of use in humans. 29 Hence, on the basis of expert opinion, we considered remdesivir use in the three patients with severe disease patterns. To the best of our knowledge, only one case of remdesivir use in COVID-19 has been reported so far. 20 Two randomised controlled trials are enrolling patients in China to assess the clinical benefit of this treatment (NCT04257656; NCT04252664). On the basis of our data, we cannot draw any conclusions on the potential efficacy of remdesivir on COVID-19 infections. In two patients, the drug was initiated at the time of disease worsening, when the virus was already barely detectable in the clinical specimens. In one of them, remdesivir was discontinued after 5 days because of a combined alanine aminotransferase elevation and a rash, although it could not be confirmed that this adverse event was related to remdesivir. In the third patient, remdesivir was discontinued after a single dose because of renal replacement therapy to avoid risk of cyclodextrin accumulation. Remdesivir contains cyclodextrin, an excipient whose clearance is linearly related to creatinine clearance. Because the patient's condition was worsening and viral load was not decreasing, we reinitiated remdesivir.",
