We identified functional iNKT cells and CD1d molecules in pig lungs. Pig iNKT cells cultured in the presence of \u03b1-GalCer proliferated and secreted Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Like in other animal models, direct activation of pig lung iNKT cells using \u03b1-GalCer resulted in acute airway hyperreactivity (AHR). Clinically, acute AHR-induced pigs had increased respiratory rate, enhanced mucus secretion in the airways, fever, etc. In addition, we observed petechial hemorrhages, infiltration of CD4 + cells, and increased Th2 cytokines in AHR-induced pig lungs. Ex vivo proliferated iNKT cells of asthma induced pigs in the presence of C-glycoside analogs of \u03b1-GalCer had predominant Th2 phenotype and secreted more of Th2 cytokine, IL-4. Thus, baby pigs may serve as a useful animal model to study iNKT cell-mediated AHR caused by various environmental and microbial CD1d-specific glycolipid antigens.",

To reconcile these differences, use of non-human primates and/or other large animal model may be beneficial.

Indeed, the pig has been used as an animal model for cystic fibrosis [4, 5] . Porcine lungs have marked similarities to humans in terms of its tracheobronchial tree structure, lung physiology, airway morphology, abundance of airway submucosal glands, and the patterns of glycoprotein synthesis [6] [7] [8] .",

Majority of NKT cells possess invariant TCR that are called \"invariant NKT\" (iNKT) [9] . iNKT cells respond to CD1d-bound lipid antigens with a unique \u03b1-anomerically linked sugar, one such well-known antigen is \u03b1-GalCer [10] . Recently, invariant TCR\u03b1 of iNKT cells and fulllength CD1d transcript in pigs have been identified [11, 12] . Molecular modeling predicts that porcine invariant TCR\u03b1 chain/poCD1d/\u03b1-GalCer form complexes that are highly homologous to the human complex [11] . CD1d molecules are structurally similar to MHC class I and are expressed on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages (M\u03c6s), B cells, subset of activated T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, and non-hematopoietic cells (keratinocytes, hepatocytes, intestinal, and lung cells) [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . iNKT cells have been grouped into CD4 + (high IL-4 and IL-13 producer) and double-negative (high IL-17 and IL-22 producer) subsets [16, 17] . iNKT cells constitutively express cytokine mRNAs and within minutes of activation rapidly secrete a large amount of cytokines, which in turn activate DCs, M\u03c6s, and T and B cells [18, 19] . iNKT cells in a CD1d-dependent manner can skew adaptive immunity toward Th2 responses, and they have been confirmed to play pivotal role in regulating the development of asthma and allergy [18, 20, 21] .",

C-glycoside analogs of \u03b1-GalCer (GCK127 and GCK152) differentially activate murine and human iNKT cells [22, 23] . The GCK152 exhibited a stronger stimulatory activity against human iNKT cells and a much weaker activity against murine iNKT cells, but the opposite trend was detected with GCK127. Invariant TCR of iNKT cells (but not CD1d) is responsible for species-specific preferential activity of C-glycosides [22] . Even though T cells with NK cell phenotype (perforin + CD3 + CD11b + CD16 + DAP10 +\u2212 DAP12 + ) and transcripts of invariant TCR\u03b1 of pig NKT cells were identified in pigs [11, 24] , their physiological relevance has not been explored. In the present study, we identified the functional iNKT cell population and CD1d molecules in the pig lungs. Furthermore, we validated a pig model of iNKT cell-mediated airway hyperreactivity (AHR). A preferential activation and cytokine production by pig iNKT cells to \u03b1-GalCer and its C-glycoside analogs was also revealed. These useful insights on pig iNKT cells may provide an opportunity to consider the pig model to explore the iNKT cell-mediated AHR for therapeutic benefits.",

Previously, AHR was successfully induced by direct activation of lung iNKT cells using \u03b1-GalCer in mice [37] and non-human primates [21] . During necropsy, in acute AHR-induced pig lungs, petechial hemorrhages (tiny pinpoint red marks, an important sign of asphyxia) on both dorsal and ventral surfaces of cranial, middle, and accessory lobes of lungs was observed (Fig. 4a) . In the airways, hypersecretion of mucus was observed, and microscopically in the lung parenchyma excessive infiltration of CD4 + cells (Fig. 4b) and accumulation of severely infiltrated inflammatory leukocytes (Fig. 4c) was also detected in AHR-induced pig lungs compared to in the lungs of vehicle-treated pigs. Clinically, \u03b1-GalCer-inoculated pigs were restless with increased respiratory rate (50-60 breaths per minute) compared to control pigs (20-40 breaths per minute) from 6 h post-\u03b1-GalCer inoculation. In addition, the body temperature of AHR-induced pigs was approximately 2\u00b0F higher compared to vehicle control pigs at 9 and 24 h post-inoculation that we recorded (Fig. 5a) .",

In the acute AHRinduced pig lungs, a two-fold increase in the total BAL cells and a 1.5-fold increase in the frequency of myeloid cells, in addition, a two-fold increase in the frequency of CD1d expressing myeloid cells (CD172 + CD1d + ) was detected compared to vehicle-treated mock pigs (Fig. 5b) .

In experimental studies, a species-specific differential activation of iNKT cells to C-glycoside analogs of \u03b1-GalCer (GCK127 and GCK152) is reported [22, 23] . To determine the response of iNKT cells to restimulation ex vivo, the \u03b1-GalCer received pigs PBMCs and lung MNCs were cultured in the presence of vehicle, \u03b1-GalCer, or C-glycoside analogs \u03b1-GalCer and then analyzed both the phenotype of iNKT cells and their cytokine response. Our results indicated that GCK127 strongly stimulated the proliferation of iNKT cells (CD3 + CD1d Tet + ) present in the PBMCs of vehicle-treated pigs compared to GCK152, as indicated by the ratio of mock/AHR-induced pig iNKT cells frequency (Fig. 6a , S1a, and S2a). Concomitantly, iNKT cells of vehicle-treated pig PBMCs secreted higher amounts of both IL-4 and IFN\u03b3 upon stimulation with GCK127 compared to GCK152, as indicated by their respective cytokine ratios (Figure 6c , d and S1c, e). In contrast, higher amounts of IL-4 was secreted by iNKT cells present in the PBMCs of acute AHR-induced pigs upon GCK152 stimulation compared to GCK127, as indicated by substantially reduced ratio of IL-4 of mock/AHR pigs ( Fig. 6c and S1e). However, comparable levels of IFN\u03b3 were secreted upon stimulation with \u03b1-GalCer and GCK127 by iNKT cells present in the PBMCs of acute AHR-induced pigs (Fig. 6d) . Approximately 30% of the normal healthy (vehicle received) pig iNKT cells express CD4\u03b1 (Fig. S2 ). GCK127 and GCK152 favored the preferential proliferation of CD4 + iNKT cells (and IL-4 production) present in the PBMCs of vehicle received and \u03b1-GalCer-inoculated pigs, respectively (Fig. 6a, c and S1a). These data indicated the preferential Th2-biased response by GCK152 in AHR-induced pigs.",

Further, we noticed a differential proliferation and cytokine production by AHR-induced pig lung iNKT cells to C-glycoside analogs of \u03b1-GalCer. Consistent with the previous reports [15, 44] , expression of CD1d on myeloid cells and lung epithelial cells was also detected in pigs. It has been shown that CD1d bound \u03b1-GalCer activates iNKT cells exclusively, both in vivo and in vitro [46, 47] . Our results in pigs also suggested that \u03b1-GalCer stimulates iNKT cells. Further studies using a stable pig CD1d expressing cell line and NKT cell clones are essential to include the valuable pig system in NKT cell research.",

As per many recent reports, children suffering from severe asthma (<5 years) and acute bronchiolitis (<1 year) also suffered from high fever [50] [51] [52] . The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 is one of the important players responsible for induction of fever in both children and pigs [53] [54] [55] . Consistent with the symptoms and immune reactions detected in children with severe asthma, pigs suffering from acute AHR also suffered from fever, many fold increase in the concentration of IL-6, and their lungs were excessively infiltrated with CD4 + cells. Thus, the baby pig model of acute AHR mediated by iNKT cells may serve as a useful addition to the asthma research.",

            "text": "Recent in vitro studies using both murine and human CD1d-expressing cell lines and NKT cell hydridomas or clones detected marked differences in the activation of NKT cells to Cglycoside analogs of \u03b1-GalCer (GCK127 and GCK152) [22, 23] . The only difference between these C-glycoside analogs is in their lipid portion; GCK152 has an aromatic ring in the acyl chain, and therefore, lipid chain binding to CD1d molecules results in a minor conformation shift of the sugar head of glycolipids which interacts with the TCR of iNKT cells [22] . Thus, the role of invariant TCR of iNKT cells (but not CD1d molecules) is responsible for differential activation of iNKT cells to lipid antigens with minor structural differences [22] . Many bacterial lipids [56] and plant pollen lipids [57] have been identified to be CD1d ligands capable of activating iNKT cells. But how iNKT cells of AHR-induced animals/patients respond when exposed to different environmental CD1d-specific lipid antigens is not known and that basic information is important to advance in the field of iNKT cell-mediated asthma research. In our study, the response of AHR-induced pig iNKT cells to GCK127 and GCK152 has provided interesting results. An increase in the frequency of CD4 + iNKT cells with concomitant increased production IL-4 upon stimulation of AHRinduced pig iNKT cells to GCK152 compared to GCK127 was detected. In contrast, near opposite results were detected by mock pig iNKT cells in response to GCK127 compared to GCK152. Thus, our data suggest that there are fundamental differences in the iNKT cell proliferation and cytokine secretion in healthy and AHR conditions mediated through iNKT cells upon exposure/re-exposure to environmental CD1d-specific antigens.",

Th2-biased immune response in patients suffering from allergic asthma conditions is common [58] . Unlike Th2 cells, iNKT cells are resistant to the effects of corticosteroids and continue to produce cytokines at doses that inactivate Th2 cells [59] . In severe persistent corticosteroid-resistant asthma, iNKT cells could be directly triggered by glycolipids from infectious microbes, plant pollen, or airways insult mediated by viruses and air pollutants [41, 56, 57, 60] . Therapies that disrupt the activation or effector function of pulmonary iNKT cells may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple forms of asthma, and such research could be easily taken up in pig models. In addition, ability of C-glycosides analogs of \u03b1-GalCer to differentially activate iNKT cells of AHR-induced pigs has provided useful impetus for future investigations.",
