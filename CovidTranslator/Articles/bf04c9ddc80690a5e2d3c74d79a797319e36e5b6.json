            "text": "The large magnitude of protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs within the human interactome necessitates the development of predictive models and screening tools to better understand this fundamental molecular communication. However, despite enormous efforts from various groups to develop predictive techniques in the last decade, PPI complex structures are in general still very challenging to predict due to the large number of degrees of freedom. In this study, we use the binding complex of human profilin (PFN1) and polyproline-10 (P10) as a model system to examine various approaches, with the aim of going beyond normal protein docking for PPI prediction and evaluation. The potential of mean force (PMF) was first obtained from the timeconsuming umbrella sampling, which confirmed that the most stable binding structure identified by the maximal PMF difference is indeed the crystallographic binding structure. Moreover, crucial residues previously identified in experimental studies, W3, H133 and S137 of PFN1, were found to form favorable hydrogen bonds with P10, suggesting a zipping process during the binding between PFN1 and P10. We then explored both regular molecular dynamics (MD) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, seeking for better criteria of ranking the PPI prediction. Despite valuable information obtained from conventional MD simulations, neither the commonly used interaction energy between the two binding parties nor the long-term root mean square displacement (RMSD) correlates well with the PMF results. On the other hand, with a sizable collection of trajectories, we demonstrated that the average rupture work calculated from SMD simulations correlates fairly well with the PMFs (R 2 = 0.67), making it a promising PPI screening method.

So far, the omnipresence of polyproline is still not fully understood. For example, in Huntingtin protein, it was found that the polyglutamine length and polyproline length undergo a co-evolution from primitive organisms to human beings 10 , which may indicate a regulatory role of polyproline length in its biological",

These methods have proven successful in certain systems, especially when proteins are rigid and/or small; however, none of them could provide reliable criteria to determine the most trustworthy prediction. Every year the Critical Assessment of PRediction of Interactions (CAPRI) contest 16 is held multiple times to test and improve various methods and protocols. Within the CAPRI framework, the contestants can submit up to 10 structures (with preferences), and the final scores are assessed based on how many hits are predicted successfully. Generally since there is no crystal structure for comparison, in past practices people used multiple models and compared the predictions, or used other empirical scoring functions to narrow down the selections.

Meanwhile a challenging aspect of this system is that proline has unusual solution properties, identified as an anomalous residue in terms of its hydrophobicity [22] [23] . Thus, PFN1-P10 provides us with two possible validation tests within one system. The first is to validate if the force field guided simulations are able to reproduce experimental findings. We conducted free energy calculations to compare the crystal structure with the best structure predicted and also to investigate its associated binding mechanism. Along the latter line, we uncovered a zipping process during the binding of P10 with PFN1, highlighting the importance of W3, H133 and S137 of PFN1. The second is to examine MD simulations, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, and free energy calculations in comparison with the protein docking score (from GRAMM-X) in order to improve the ranking of docked structures and potentially go beyond protein-protein docking. We found that by following the protocol of using SMD simulation on the GRAMM-X docked structures, we were able to rank the relative stability of the PPI docked structures with reasonably high confidence.",

Hydrogen bonds are first formed between the C-terminus of P10 (residue 9~10) and PFN1.

Therefore, the close packing between two residues requires the distance to be smaller than 0.4 nm. For example, S = 0.8 indicates that the average minimal distance between any proline in P10 to W3, Y6, Y139 from PFN1 is 0.52 nm. Figure S2 shows that aromatic-proline stacking reaches the highest strength when P10 is close to PFN1 with a step function type of behavior. Combining Figure 3 and Figure S2 , we observed a concerted formation of hydrogen bonds and aromatic-proline stacking when P10 approaches PFN1. This \"zipping\" mechanism is reproducible with two different binding modes for the crystal binding pocket: mode9 ( Figure 3 ) and mode11 ( Figure S1 ). Thus, in addition to the conventional aromatic-proline interaction dominated mechanism, we demonstrated that hydrogen bonds between PFN1 residues (serines, tyrosines and tryptophans) and prolines also contribute significantly to the interactions, thus resulting in a \"zipping\" mechanism. Such observation also helps to explain the \"anomaly\" of the hydrophobicity of prolines discussed before 22 .",

RMSDs of PFN1 with respect to aligned initial structures are plotted in Figure S3A .

The structure of P10 stays as a polyproline II (PPII) helix throughout all of the simulations. This agrees with the widely accepted notion that polyproline should be a rigid PPII helix when the repeat length is smaller than 10. 19 However, the RMSDs of the PFN1-P10 complex with respect to the aligned initial structure ( Figure S3C ) indicate that the binding interfaces can change significantly in some of the binding modes. For example, mode3 (bright red) reaches as high as Figure S3C , while PFN1 and P10 remains stable individually ( Figure S3A and Figure S3B ). The RMSDs of P10 with respect to the initial complex structure (not aligned, Figure S3D ) further fortify this observation, displaying a similar trend to Figure S3C .",

The binding modes that feature major interfacial residue shifts are mode2, mode3, mode6, mode7 and mode8, mainly from Category I and Category II binding modes. More specifically, mode2 and mode8 in Category I deviate from the original hydrophobic interfacial binding, with mode2 transitioning to Category III and mode8 transitioning to Category IV, respectively. Even the relatively stable binding mode in Category I (mode1) shows a slight increase in the C-terminal region, which is the signature binding site of the co-crystal structure (Category IV). The mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic binding interface Category II is also not very stable, with mode3 moving towards a hybrid Category II and Category III binding mode, and mode6 moving towards Category IV binding mode. Overall, all binding modes from Category I (mode1, mode2, mode8) and Category II (mode3, mode6, mode10) have tendencies to shift towards Category III and Category IV, which clearly indicates that MD simulations prefer the mixed hydrophobic/hydrophilic binding interfaces for P10.

The absolute values of rupture works from 0.1nm/ns SMD (<-15 kcal/mol) are closer to the PMF differences (see Table S1 for details), compared to the range (-10 ~ -30 kcal/mol) from 1 nm/ns SMD. This is in agreement with previous practice on free energy estimations from SMD simulations. 47 For our purpose, instead of following the common sense of \"the slower the better\" in the field (0.01 or even 0.001 nm/ns), we use a relatively fast rupture speed (1 or 0.1 nm/ns) to rank the docked structures. For example, each simulation only takes ~2.5 ns or ~25 ns for SMD with 1nm/ns or 0.1nm/ns rupture speed, respectively. This means that from 2.5 ns\u00d710 replicas = 25 ns of simulations in total, a trend in PMFs can be predicted by SMD with high confidence, as compared to the 50 ns of MD simulation sampling a local well on the free energy landscape, or 20\u00d720 = 400 ns of umbrella sampling for numerous binding modes from one PPI pair. Moreover, the replica numbers can be reduced to 6 to reach a comparable R 2 (see Figure S8 A, Figure S8 B) which further decreases the total simulation time to 15 ns (for 1 nm/ns SMD).",

The correlation coefficients between the ranks are similar compared to the correlation coefficients between the absolute values ( Figure S9 A-E), ruling out the \"clustering effect\" of the data (meaning the ranks may be interchangeable when absolute numbers are close). In Figure S9 F, we list the most stable binding modes predicted from the 5 metrics. Interestingly, mode7 is the most stable binding mode for 4 out of 5 metrics except for the rupture work (from 1 nm/ns SMD) where mode4 (in Category III along with mode7) is predicted to be the most stable. The ranks of mode11 are reliable except for maximal forces (from 0.1 nm/ns SMD). The ranks of mode9 are also high in the list but may be affected by its structural flexibility seen in the MD simulations. Notably, the top ranks derived from the rupture works from SMD correspond well to the most stable binding structures obtained from the umbrella sampling, indicating that this technique could provide a fast and reliable way of ranking the PPI binding modes from the protein docking programs such as GRAMM-X.",

We demonstrate that the OPLS-AA force field guided umbrella sampling is able to identify the crystal structure as the most stable binding structure, which also appears in the top 10 list from GRAMM-X. Our comparative analysis shows that aromatic-proline stacking contributes the most to the stabilization of PFN1-P10 binding, along with the formation of hydrogen bonds between serines/tyrosines/tryptophans and prolines. Although regular MD simulations provide mixed information in terms of predicting the most stable binding structure, yet we find that 50 ns RMSDs might be useful with cautions for ranking the PPI prediction (see Supporting Information for details).
