IL-17A neutralization did not affect MHV-A59-induction of HMGB1 liberation and slightly augmented plasmatic uric acid concentration. However, mice treated with the MAb failed to produce autoAb to FAH. The above results suggest a reciprocal regulation of Th1 and Th17 cells acting on the different MHV-A59 effects. In addition, it is proposed that IL-17A is involved in alarmins adjuvant effects leading to autoAb expression.",

            "text": "Interleukin 17 is a family of cytokines among which IL-17A is considered as one of the major proinflammatory cytokine, being central to the innate and adaptive immune responses [1] . Particularly, IL-17A levels correlate with a variety of hepatic disorders, whereas another IL-17 family member, IL-17F, does not have a currently defined role in hepatic illness [1] . Of interest, IL-17A and IL-17F signals, through a heterodimeric receptor, consist of both IL-17RA and IL-17RC subunits. IL-17RA is expressed ubiquitously, including expression by resident liver cells [2] . IL-17A plays important roles in the host immunity against extracellular pathogens and in chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis [3] . Additionally, it has been suggested that IL-17A is an important factor in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis [4] and hepatitis B [5] . Data from other studies indicate that plasma levels of IL-17A are also elevated in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis [3] . Mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV), belonging to coronavirus group, induce acute or subclinical hepatitis, neurological, respiratory, or/and enteric diseases in mice according to serotypes. The highly hepatotropic mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV-3) is known as the most virulent MHV strain, causing fulminant hepatitis and death of susceptible C57BL/6 mice within 3 to 5 days postinfection and neurological disease following nonlethal hepatitis in semisusceptible C3H mice [6, 7] . The weakly hepatotropic MHV-A59 causes no mortality and moderate hepatitis without neurological disease in mice when inoculated intraperitoneally. Brain invasion and disease by the MHV-A59 serotype is, however, enabled following intranasal infection [8] . Liver dysfunction in MHV-3-infected mice results from several foci of extensive necrosis in contrast to that observed in the liver of mice infected with the MHV-A59 serotype. All MHV serotypes use the CEACAM1a molecule as viral receptor for infection of host cells through interaction with their viral surface (S) protein. It was previously demonstrated that the differential levels of viral replication and hepatitis induced by the MHV serotypes were largely related to the viral S protein, suggesting that interactions of the S protein with molecules other than CEACAM1a may reflect their virulence for liver [7] [8] [9] . We have reported the presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) to liver and kidney fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in sera from various mouse strains after MHV-A59 infection [10] . It was shown that the expression of anti-FAH autoAb was closely associated with the MHV-A59-induced release of some danger signals such as uric acid and high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) [10] . To establish a new experimental model of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), we treated BALB/c mice with carbon tetrachloride after MHV-A59 infection [11] . Then, we used mice from the C57BL/6 strain, more susceptible to MHV-A59-infection than BALB/c, that spontaneously developed several signs of AIH after infection, that is, hypergammaglobulinemia, autoAb to liver antigens (Ag), elevated transaminases and, interestingly, liver infiltrate [11] . Zhao et al. [4] found that IL-17A plasma concentration was elevated in patients with AIH compared with controls or patients with other liver diseases. Thus, to study whether IL-17A is implicated in our model of MHV-A59-infection and AIH, we explored the effects of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the cytokine on various biological parameters affected by the virus. Neutralization of IL-17A by the MAb resulted in a decreased level of mouse transaminases and anti-FAH autoAb induced by the virus, increased Ig serum concentration and IFN-\u2425 secretion. Survival of the infected animals as well as liver pathology was not affected by the MAb anti-IL-17A. Furthermore, results from mouse treatment with MAb anti-IL-17F and/or anti-IFN\u2425 strongly suggested interplay of the Th1 and Th17 cells acting on MHV-A59-infected mice [12, 13] .",

            "text": "Recent progress in studies of IL-17A and Th17 cells has revealed important roles for IL-17A in the development of allergic and autoimmune diseases as well as in protective mechanisms against bacterial and fungal infections, functions that were previously believed to be mediated by Th1 or Th2 cells [23] . Herein, we study the effects of blocking IL-17A and IL-17F in MHV-A59-infected mice, together with the simultaneous treatment with a MAb anti-IFN\u2425. Results showed that IL-17A was undetected in control and MHV-A59-infected animals, whereas MAb anti-IL-17A administration did increase IL-17A concentration. As described in Results, mice were inoculated with biotinylated MAb anti-IL-17A and complexes MAb/IL-17A measured by ELISA. Because high levels of IL-17A bound to the MAb were found, it was concluded that anti-IL-17A MAb increased the in vivo half-life of the cytokine. Similar observations were described previously for MAb anti-IL-4 or anti-IFN\u2425 [19, 20] . Because it was previously shown that MAb MM17F3 neutralizes IL-17A biological activity [21] , high levels of circulating MAb/cytokine mean that IL-17A is sequestered from binding to its receptors and so the ultimate MAb effect is to decrease IL-17A biological activity. Consequently, the difference between levels of IL-17A bound to MAb MM17F3 found in control and MHV-A59infected animals could reflect differential metabolisms of the cytokine in both situations. Under our experimental conditions, neutralization of IL-17A by the MAb led to a sharp decrease of transaminase released after infection. This effect is similar to that reported by Kobayashi et al. [24] in a model of halothane-induced liver injury. The authors informed that the intraperitoneal administration of a specific MAb anti-mouse IL-17A inoculated 9 h after halothane administration reduced plasmatic AST and ALT levels [24] . It is well known that MHV-A59-infected mice develop hypergammaglobulinemia [11] . Surprisingly, we found that IL-17A neutralization did increase the Ig levels over those elicited by the virus infection only. To our knowledge, there is not a report demonstrating a direct relationship between IL-17A and Ab production by B-cells. As stated by Shibui et al. [25] , the role of IL-17A in Ig production by B cells is unclear. These authors suggested that IL-17A may be indirectly involved in Ab production through the release of B cell activator(s) by other immune cells [25] .",

Neutralizing IFN-\u2425 should therefore increase the liver damages and hence the transaminase levels and the hypergammaglobulinemia, a well-known consequence of liver inflammation. On the contrary, because IL-17A is involved in the liver damages, its neutralization should decrease the MHV-A59-induced hypergammaglobulinemia as well as the transaminase levels. However, no decrease, but instead an increase, of hypergammaglobulinemia was observed. A possible explanation could be as follows. MHV-A59 induces an IgG2a hypergammaglobulinemia, indicating the implications of Th1 cells and IFN\u2425. Owing to the mutual inhibition between Th17 and Th1, IL-17 neutralization should necessarily increase the Th1 or IFN\u2425 immune effects and so explain the increase of the MHV-A59induced hypergammaglobulinemia. These results suggest a reciprocal regulation of Th1 and Th17 cells, both regulating release of liver transaminases and Ig production. Such interplay of both cell lineages has been described elsewhere [12, 13, 27] .",

Remarkably, IL-17A neutralization did not reduce MHV-A59-induction of uric acid or HMGB1 liberation but abolished the autoAb to FAH at 15 days after treatment. Because at the same time the MAb anti-IL-17A augmented Ig concentration, the enhanced hypergammaglobulinemia could mask the existence of the autoAb to FAH. However, administration of MAb anti-IL-17F also abolished autoAb to FAH, whereas it has no effect on Ig plasmatic levels. Furthermore, sera from MHV-A59-infected mice treated with anti-IFN\u2425 showed no autoAb to FAH, neither at 15 nor at 30 days after infection and treatment. Thus, the above results suggest that, although uric acid or HMGB1 liberation is necessary in the induction of autoAb to FAH, the action of both alarmins could be expressed thanks to the presence of IL-17A, IL-17F and/or IFN\u2425. To our knowledge, it is the first time that such a regulation of alarmins by cytokines is demonstrated. It is broadly accepted that Th cells coordinate immune responses by producing cytokines. Many different Th-cells subsets have been identified, the most well-defined effectors Th subsets include Th1 cells, which make IFN-\u2425; Th2 cells, which produce IL-4; and Th17 cells, which generate IL-17. Cytokines play critical roles in regulating the differentiation of naive Th cells into different subsets and their effectors function [12] . Besides, it has been reported that Th17 cells are relatively unstable and can exhibit functional plasticity, particularly at sites of inflammation [13] . Thus, Th17 cells can transition through a stage of producing both IL-17 and IFN\u2425 and then lose expression of IL-17 to resemble a Th1-like cell [13] . Although the liver undergoes a high exposure to circulating antigens from the gut microbiota, it maintains a special local immune tolerogenic microenvironment. Tolerance is relevant for chronic persistence of hepatotropic viruses or allograft acceptance after liver transplantation. Conserved mechanisms such as alarmins, Toll-like receptor signaling, or inflammasome activation initiate inflammatory responses in the liver. The final result of the intrahepatic immune response, that is, fibrosis or resolution, depends not only on macrophages and dendritic cells functions, but also on the balance between proinflammatory and antiinflammatory T-cell populations [29, 30] . Under our experimental conditions, the blockade of IL-17A by the MAb suggests that the cytokine is involved in the various MHV-A59 effects, although there is not exact coincidence with the IL-17A activity described in other models of liver pathology [1, 4, 5, 31] . We cannot prove that the mechanisms cited above are acting in concert in the present work, but our results agree with the statement of Hammerich et al. [31] : \"The exact pathogenic contribution of Th17 cells to liver inflammation might very well vary upon the underlying disease, for example, between infectious and autoimmune disorders.\"",

The main finding of our study is that neutralization of IL-17A resulted in a notable decreased level of mouse transaminases and anti-FAH autoAb induced by the virus, whereas an increased Ig serum and IFN-\u2425 secretion were detected. The expression of anti-FAH autoAb is associated with the MHV-A59induced release of uric acid and HMGB1. Remarkably, IL-17A neutralization did not reduce MHV-A59-induction of uric acid or HMGB1 liberation but abolished the autoAb to FAH. The administration of MAb anti-IL-17F exhibited the same effect, whereas mice infected treated with anti-IFN\u2425 showed no autoAb to FAH. This results strongly suggested interplay of the Th1 and Th17 cells acting on MHV-A59-infected mice.",

This effect was reverted by the simultaneous administration of MAb anti-IL-17A (figure 2A) Treatment with MAb anti-IFN\u2425 or anti-IL-17A alone, or inoculated simultaneously, somewhat elevated Ig levels over those of control mice (figure 2B).
