            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been transmitted extensively within hospitals, and healthcare workers (HCWs) have comprised a large proportion of SARS cases worldwide. We present a stochastic model of a SARS outbreak in a community and its hospital. For a range of basic reproductive numbers (R 0 ) corresponding to conditions in different cities (but with emphasis on R 0~3 as reported for Hong Kong and Singapore), we evaluate contact precautions and case management (quarantine and isolation) as containment measures. Hospital-based contact precautions emerge as the most potent measures, with hospital-wide measures being particularly important if screening of HCWs is inadequate. For R 0 = 3, case isolation alone can control a SARS outbreak only if isolation reduces transmission by at least a factor of four and the mean symptom-onset-to-isolation time is less than 3 days. Delays of a few days in contact tracing and case identification severely degrade the utility of quarantine and isolation, particularly in high-transmission settings. Still more detrimental are delays between the onset of an outbreak and the implementation of control measures; for given control scenarios, our model identifies windows of opportunity beyond which the efficacy of containment efforts is reduced greatly. By considering pathways of transmission in our system, we show that if hospital-based transmission is not halted, measures that reduce community-HCW contact are vital to preventing a widespread epidemic. The implications of our results for future emerging pathogens are discussed.",

In the absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, policies are restricted to case management (such as the isolation of known cases and quarantine of their contacts) and contact precautions for identifiable high-risk groups. Owing to limitations in public health resources and concern about personal freedoms and economic impacts, policy-makers face decisions regarding the relative importance of such efforts. This paper identifies priorities and trade-offs for the control of the newly identified coronavirus that has caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide, particularly in parts of Asia.

Disease control measures are described by explicit parameters, so their respective contributions to containment can be teased apart (see table 1 ). The hospitalization rates of infected community members and HCWs are denoted by h c and h h , respectively, and q is the rate of quarantining exposed individuals in the community following contact tracing.

A final parameter r describes efforts to reduce contact between offduty HCWs and the community. Control parameters are thus divided into those describing case-management measures (h c , h h , q, g, k) and those describing contact precautions (h and r). The most difficult process to characterize in any epidemic is disease transmission. This can be divided into a contact process and the probability of transmission given contact. The former varies dramatically between communities (owing to, for example, usage patterns of public transport or housing density) and between diseases (owing to different modes of transmission); the latter also depends on both the disease (the proximity required for transmission) and the community (cultural mores relating to intimacy of contact and hygiene). Thus, transmission rates are both disease-and community-dependent and will vary from country to country, as well as between cities within a region . This geographical variation translates directly into variations in the basic reproductive number R 0 of the epidemic, which is the average number of secondary cases generated by a 'typical' infectious individual in a completely susceptible population, in the absence of control measures (Diekmann & Heesterbeek 2000) . For instance, SARS is likely to have different R 0 values in Beijing and Toronto, owing to differences in cultural practices, environmental conditions and population density. Such differences are confirmed by Galvani et al. (2003) , who report widely varying doubling times for SARS outbreaks in six affected regions.",

As acknowledged by these authors, the estimation of R 0 is complicated by healthcare practices in place before outbreaks are recognized-measuring a disease's rate of spread in the true absence of control is rarely Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B (2003) possible. In the case of SARS, non-specific control measures may have helped or hindered early epidemic growth: hospitalization of symptomatic cases reduced transmission to the general community, but put HCWs at risk owing to unprotected medical procedures, possibly contributing to so-called super-spreading events. (Note that the R 0 reported by Riley et al. (2003) excludes such events.) Estimates of R 0 from data including non-specific control measures therefore could be biased in either direction. Taking note of the confidence intervals cited above, R 0 values associated with SARS in different parts of the world could easily vary from 1.5 to 5-roughly the same range as has been estimated for influenza (Hethcote 2000; Ferguson et al. 2003) . SARS is thought to be primarily transmitted via large-droplet contact, compared with airborne transmission via droplet nuclei for influenza, but faecal-oral and fomite transmission are suspected in some circumstances (Riley et al. 2003; Seto et al. 2003; Wenzel & Edmond 2003) .",

Disease transmission occurs via the following pathways, with contributions weighted as shown in figure 1d . The hazard rate of infection for susceptibles in the community, represented by l c , contains contributions from unmanaged incubating and symptomatic community members (E c and I c ), as well as off-duty HCWs (E h and I h ).

Details of the incubating and symptomatic substructures are discussed in electronic Appendix A. Independent of the disease progression described in (b) and (c), individuals can enter case management with daily probabilities q for quarantine, or h c and h h for isolation (in the community and HCW groups, respectively). Individuals must already be in class I c or I h to be isolated, so the soonest that an un-quarantined individual can be isolated is after the first day of symptoms; individuals in quarantine are assumed to move directly into isolation when symptoms develop. (d ) The transmission hazard rates for susceptible individuals S j are denoted by l j ( j = c,h) and depend on weighted contributions from community and HCW sources as described in \u00a7 2 (and table 1). The discrete-time stochastic formulation of our model allows for the possibility of multiple infectious contacts within a timestep, so for a susceptible individual subject to total hazard rate l j the probability of infection on a given day is 1 2 exp(2l j ). (Note that the units of b are day 2 1 .) We assume density-independent contact rates and random mixing within each pool, so hazard rates of infection are dependent on the transmission rate for each infectious class multiplied by the proportion of the population in that class. Specifically, defining the effective number of individuals in the hospital mixing pool as N h = S h 1 E h 1 I h 1 R h 1 I m and in the community mixing pool as",

First we explore whether case isolation alone can control a SARS outbreak in a community and its hospital, as a function of the daily probability that a symptomatic individual in the community will be identified and isolated (h c ), and the factor by which isolation modifies the transmission rate (k). We compare scenarios where hospital-wide transmission occurs at the same rate (h = 1, figure 2c) versus half the rate (h = 0.5, figure 2d), as in the general community. Unsurprisingly, the extent of measures required to control an outbreak is strongly dependent on R 0 . If R 0~3 (as reported for SARS in Hong Kong and Singapore) and no general contact precautions are taken in the hospital (figure 2c, black curves), we see that an outbreak can be controlled only if case isolation reduces transmission by at least a factor of four (k , 0.25), and the mean onset-to-hospitalization time is less than 3 days (h c . 0.3). More stringent infection control (lower values of k) allows slightly slower hospitalization to be effective.

For example, when R 0 = 5 and h = 0.5 (figure 2d, purple lines), if case isolation is initiated after the first day of symptoms then a sixfold reduction in transmission (k~0.17) and 40% daily isolation probability (h c = 0.4) is sufficient to contain the outbreak (point marked \u00a4 ), whereas delaying isolation for 2 more days requires near-perfect isolation practices (k , 0.1, h c . 0.7) to assure containment.

Conversely, increasing h c significantly boosts control from point A but has negligible effects from point B. This threshold arises because even if all cases are isolated immediately (h c = 1) the epidemic will not be contained unless k is sufficiently low. Conversely, even if isolation stops transmission entirely (k = 0), the outbreak will not be contained unless a sufficient proportion of cases are isolated soon enough. The sharpness of this threshold arises in part because the proportion of individuals not isolated by the nth day is (1 2 h c ) n , where values of n~10 2 20 are pertinent because individuals with SARS often remain symptomatic for an extended period. The threshold softens as R 0 increases, since when transmission rates are higher the critical values of n are smaller (i.e. individuals must be isolated sooner, on average, to keep R , 1). These findings highlight that pushing blindly to upgrade any given control measure may not advance the fight against SARS; with limited resources, the best approach is to identify where the current policy is failing (e.g. inadequate case identification versus ineffective isolation practices) and make targeted improvements.",

The proportion traced by the nth day is 1 2 (1 2 q) n , which, for n~5 (the median incubation period for SARS), approaches 1 quickly as q increases. If contact tracing is delayed such that no individuals are quarantined until 5 days following exposure (leftmost lines in figure 2e), the contribution of quarantine is considerably reduced even if q is high. This follows because 5 days is the median incubation period, so that half of the cases will already have developed symptoms before quarantining begins. Thus, it is essential for contact tracing to begin quickly, even if coverage is initially low: tracing just a few exposed contacts quickly can have a large effect.

We set \u00ab = 0.1, and b was varied to give the desired R values, with no control measures imposed. Probabilities were calculated from 100 runs per R-value. (c2e) Threshold control policies for containment of the epidemic. Lines show R = 1 contours for scenarios where R 0 = 1.5 (green), 2 (blue), 2.5 (red), 3 (black), 4 (light blue) and 5 (purple); parameter regions to the left of the lines give R , 1. Not all cases appear because some are off the scale. (c,d ) The effect of varying h c (the daily probability that symptomatic SARS cases in the community will be isolated) and k (the modification to transmission owing to case isolation procedures) for h = 1 and h = 0.5, respectively, on the threshold where R = 1. From right to left, three lines of each colour show the effects of increasing delays in case isolation (i.e. each symptomatic individual has no possibility of being isolated for 1, 2 or 3 days, respectively, but a constant daily probability (h c ) thereafter). Points in (d ) marked A, B and \u00a4 are described in \u00a7 3b. We assume no quarantining (q = 0) and a fixed strategy of case isolation of symptomatic hospital workers (h h = 0.9) starting after their first day of symptoms. Other parameter values: r = 1, \u00ab = 0.1. (e) The extent to which contact tracing and quarantine can substitute for imperfect case isolation. Here, h = 0.5, r = 1, g = 0.5, h c = 0.3 and h h = 0.9, so the case isolation strategy is fixed (and assumed to commence after the first day of symptoms), but the degree to which transmission is reduced by isolation (k) varies. From right to left, two solid lines of each colour represent 1-day and 5-day delays in contact tracing before quarantining begins. Solid lines show the case \u00ab = 0.1, when transmission can occur during the incubation period. The dotted lines show the case \u00ab = 0 (please note that in this case R 0 = 2.44, 2.92 and 3.90, rather than 2.5, 3 and 4). ( f ) Sensitivity of effective reproductive number R to the four transmission-control parameters. In all cases R 0 = 3, \u00ab = 0.1, q = 0.5, h c = 0.3 and h h = 0.9; all parameters k, g, r, h were set to 0.5, then varied one at a time.",

We treat a scenario with R 0 = 3, similar to outbreaks in Hong Kong and Singapore. The median and 50% confidence intervals (i.e. the 25th and 75th percentile values) of cumulative incidence indicate that such an epidemic is likely to spread rapidly through the population if uncontrolled (figure 3a, black lines). Control strategies emphasizing contact precautions (figure 3a, green lines) or quarantine and isolation (figure 3a, red lines) both reduce the effective reproductive number to R = 1.5, thereby substantially slowing the epidemic's rate of growth and increasing the probability of containment. A combined strategy of contact precautions and case-management measures reduces R to below 1 (R = 0.84 in this case-blue lines in figure  3a) , thereby leading to rapid containment of the outbreak in 85% of simulations. Considering the elements of the next-generation matrix (see figure 3 caption), we see that control is finally achieved because simultaneous lowering of k and h brought R c h and R h h below 1. In all cases R c c , 1, thus transmission involving the high-risk HCW pool is required to sustain the uncontrolled outbreaks. Figure 3 . (a) Increase in cumulative cases over 200 days, for an uncontrolled outbreak compared with three control strategies. For each day we plot the median value (solid line) and 25th and 75th percentiles (dashed lines) of 500 simulations. Probabilities of containment (and 95% confidence intervals) for each scenario are shown in the legend. Control strategies are implemented 28 days after the first symptomatic case. In all instances \u00ab = 0.1 and R 0 = 3. Strategy 1 (contact precautions): h c = 0.3, h h = 0.9, h = 0.5, r = 0.5, k = 1, g = 1, q = 0, yielding R = 1.5 once implemented ({R cc ,R ch ,R hc ,R hh } = (0.56, 1.04, 0.12, 1.36) ).

In all cases, a prompt public health response is critical to containing a SARS outbreak. This is the case particularly for strategies that do not reduce R to below 1, as the possibility of stochastic fadeout (see figure 2b ) falls drastically if the disease has time to spread beyond the initial few cases. We also considered the impact of implementation delays on the most effective, combined strategy from figure 3a, in scenarios where R 0 equals 2, 3 and 4 (figure 3c). Again, timing is critical, especially for the mosttransmissible case when the effective R after control is greater than 1. In all cases in figure 3b,c, a window of opportunity exists at the beginning of a SARS epidemic when a given control strategy has the greatest chance of success. This critical period is lengthened by more effective control strategies, lower-transmission settings, and, potentially, by a smaller hospital pool (see electronic Appendix A). As implementation is delayed, the probability of containing the epidemic is reduced to levels obtained in the absence of control; for instance if R 0 = 3, the weaker strategies lose their possible impact on containment within a few weeks, and even the highly effective combined strategy must be implemented within two months to show any gains over doing nothing. Note that this result pertains strictly to epidemic containment (as we define it), and is oriented toward minimizing overall morbidity and mortality. We emphasize that implementation of stringent control measures is all the more essential if containment has already been lost and a full-scale epidemic is in progress.",

Note that h-to-c transmission-describing infections in the community caused by off-duty HCWs-accounts for 15% of all infections in this scenario, and that a significant number of cases arise in the community each day. In figure 4b we plot results for an identical scenario, except that the contact of HCWs with community members is reduced tenfold (i.e. r = 0.1). This control measure notably decreases the growth rate of the epidemic (R = 1.4 instead of 1.6, as in figure 4a), and even more dramatically alters the patterns of spread: h-to-c transmission drops from 15% to just 2% of all infections. Furthermore, there is minimal ongoing transmission between community members-as R c c is virtually unchanged from figure 4a (see figure caption), we attribute this to the reduction in re-seeding from the HCW pool (note that R h c drops from 0.23 to 0.02 owing to the decrease in r).",

HCWs are thus exposed to a local prevalence of much higher than that in the community-at-large, and as a result measures that reduce transmission within the hospital have the greatest impact on the reproductive number (R) of the epidemic. Hospital-wide precautions (h) have the strongest effect on R, followed by specific precautions for isolating SARS patients (k). This finding is bolstered by the detailed account of Dwosh et al. (2003) of a comprehensive and effective response by a community hospital near Toronto. A dedicated SARS ward was established (under negative air pressure to prevent aerosol spread to other parts of the hospital) and private rooms were provided for each SARS patient (also under negative pressure); these measures correspond to reduced k in our model. Intensive barrier and contact precautions were practised by all hospital staff at all times (corresponding to h \u00bf 1). Hospital staff were screened at least twice daily for SARS symptoms, increasing h h . Further measures included voluntary quarantine of all staff presumed exposed, restriction of visitor and patient numbers, and prevention of patient or staff transfers to other institutions.

Fortunately, measures that reduce h are simple and inexpensive-masks, gowns and hand-washing significantly reduced transmission of SARS to HCWs in Hong Kong (Seto et al. 2003) . For a broad range of scenarios our model indicates that high values of h (i.e. poor precautions) contribute more to epidemic growth than any other parameter, thus some degree of hospital-wide contact precautions is essential to combating a SARS outbreak. Whenever within-hospital measures are insufficient to stop infection of HCWs, however, it becomes critical to reduce leakage of the infection back into the community. Reducing contacts of off-duty HCWs with community members can accomplish this goal, but can produce the perverse effect that good HCW precautions lead to a higher proportion of SARS cases being HCWs. This results not from a higher incidence among HCWs, but from preventing infection from escaping back into the general community. HCWs in Hanoi effectively sealed themselves off from the outside world, resulting in the fastest containment of any significant SARS outbreak but also one in which 63% of cases were HCWs (Reilley et al. 2003; Twu et al. 2003) .",

In our model, heterogeneity in secondary cases arises owing to stochastic effects, but SARS transmission is assumed to be a homogeneous process (in that the baseline transmission rate is represented by a single parameter, b). Lipsitch et al. (2003) found that increasing variance (b) show two stochastic epidemics with identical disease parameters and control measures, differing only in HCW-community mixing precautions (r = 1 in (a) and r = 0.1 in (b)). Daily incidence is shown, broken down by route of transmission within or between the hospital and community pools. Inset, pie-charts show average contributions of the different routes of infection for 500 stochastic simulations of each epidemic (standard errors for these proportions were estimated by jack-knifing the simulation results, but in all cases were less than one percentage point). Note that c-to-h transmission includes hospitalized community members infecting the HCWs caring for them. R 0 = 3 in both cases, and other parameters are from Scenario 1 of figure 3: \u00ab = 0.1, k = 1, h = 0.5. q = 0, h c = 0.3, h h = 0.9, yielding R = 1.60 in (a) ({R cc ,R ch ,R hc ,R hh } = (0.55, 1.05, 0.23, 1.37)) and R = 1.39 in (b) ({R cc ,R ch ,R hc ,R hh } = (0.57, 1.04, 0.02, 1.36)). The control policy is implemented 14 days into the outbreak.",

We calculate R 0 from its formal definition, however, as the expected number of secondary cases in the absence of control measures (i.e. without hospitalization or any contact precautions). While it is uncertain whether routine health practices help or hinder the spread of SARS, we suspect that estimates of R 0 under our strict definition would be somewhat higher than those reported for Hong Kong and Singapore (which incorporate some measures, such as hospitalization, from the outset). Of course this will depend on the details of non-specific healthcare practices in each setting, on assumptions regarding their effect on SARS spread, and on how R 0 is calculated (particularly the treatment of SSEs).",

            "text": "Figure 2. (a) Sample output from the model, showing cumulative numbers of cases. Five realizations of the stochastic model are shown for three values of R, to highlight variability in outcomes and the increased probability of fadeout for lower R. Several epidemics died out immediately and cannot be resolved from one another (one for R = 2, and two each for R = 1.6 and R = 1.2). (b) The probability of epidemic containment (as defined in the text) as a function of R, for a population of 100 000 with a single initial case. We set \u00ab = 0.1, and b was varied to give the desired R values, with no control measures imposed. Probabilities were calculated from 100 runs per R-value. (c2e) Threshold control policies for containment of the epidemic. Lines show R = 1 contours for scenarios where R 0 = 1.5 (green), 2 (blue), 2.5 (red), 3 (black), 4 (light blue) and 5 (purple); parameter regions to the left of the lines give R , 1. Not all cases appear because some are off the scale. (c,d ) The effect of varying h c (the daily probability that symptomatic SARS cases in the community will be isolated) and k (the modification to transmission owing to case isolation procedures) for h = 1 and h = 0.5, respectively, on the threshold where R = 1. From right to left, three lines of each colour show the effects of increasing delays in case isolation (i.e. each symptomatic individual has no possibility of being isolated for 1, 2 or 3 days, respectively, but a constant daily probability (h c ) thereafter). Points in (d ) marked A, B and \u00a4 are described in \u00a7 3b. We assume no quarantining (q = 0) and a fixed strategy of case isolation of symptomatic hospital workers (h h = 0.9) starting after their first day of symptoms. Other parameter values: r = 1, \u00ab = 0.1. (e) The extent to which contact tracing and quarantine can substitute for imperfect case isolation. Here, h = 0.5, r = 1, g = 0.5, h c = 0.3 and h h = 0.9, so the case isolation strategy is fixed (and assumed to commence after the first day of symptoms), but the degree to which transmission is reduced by isolation (k) varies. From right to left, two solid lines of each colour represent 1-day and 5-day delays in contact tracing before quarantining begins. Solid lines show the case \u00ab = 0.1, when transmission can occur during the incubation period. The dotted lines show the case \u00ab = 0 (please note that in this case R 0 = 2.44, 2.92 and 3.90, rather than 2.5, 3 and 4). ( f ) Sensitivity of effective reproductive number R to the four transmission-control parameters. In all cases R 0 = 3, \u00ab = 0.1, q = 0.5, h c = 0.3 and h h = 0.9; all parameters k, g, r, h were set to 0.5, then varied one at a time.",
