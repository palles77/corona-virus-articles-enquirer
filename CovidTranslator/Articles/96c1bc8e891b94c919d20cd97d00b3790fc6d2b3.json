The cells were allowed to settle for 20 min on ice, before the upper 25 ml containing dead cells and debris were discarded. The remaining 25 ml were spun down for 10 min at 500 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. The pellet was washed in William`s E Medium/10 % FCS/1 % PSQ and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 3 min. Finally, cells were resuspended in William`s E Medium/10 % FCS/1 % PSQ and seeded at a density of 0.75-1x10 6 cells/well on 6-well plates precoated with 50 mg/l rat tail collagen type I (BD, Cat.
