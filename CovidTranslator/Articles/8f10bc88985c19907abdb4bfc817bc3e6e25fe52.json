J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes very high mortality in newborn piglets. The mucosal immune system in the gut must eliminate potential pathogens while maintaining a mutually beneficial relationship with the commensal microbiota. Antibodies derived from the secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) class, act as the first line of antigen-specific immunity in the gut by recognizing both pathogens and commensals. Therefore, the measurement of SIgA levels is an important index in evaluating PEDV infections and immune status. A simple and rapid method for the detection of PEDV-specific SIgA using an immunochromatographic test strip has been developed; incorporating a colloidal gold-labeled anti-SIgA secretory component (SC) mAb probe for the detection of anti-PEDV-specific SIgA in swine. On the strip, a gold-labeled anti-SIgA SC mAb was applied to a conjugate pad; purified PEDV particles and goat anti-mouse antibodies were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane to form the test and control lines, respectively.",

In J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f contrast to serum IgA, which is derived from plasma cells in the bone marrow, SIgA is generated locally by plasma cells in the lamina propria, which lies beneath the intestinal epithelium (Kaetzel, 2005) . The protective action of SIgA in the infant gut is a result of many processes, including intracellular neutralization and viral particle excretion, immune exclusion, whereby SIgA agglutinates bacteria and viruses, as well as prevents the binding of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, and interference with bacterial motility (van Egmond et al., 2001) . At high endogenous concentrations of SIgA, infants are less likely to have experienced illness in the preceding and subsequent months (Breakey et al., 2015) .",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a simple and rapid immunochromatographic test strip incorporating a colloidal gold-labeled anti-SIgA SC mAb probe for the detection of anti-PEDV-specific SIgA in swine, and to compare its performance with an indirect SIgA ELISA based on the whole PEDV virus (Cong et al., 2019) .",

IgA plays an important role in providing protection at mucosal surfaces, and it is effective in neutralizing bacterial toxins. Furthermore, polymeric IgA has been shown to be more effective at neutralizing exotoxins from Clostridium difficile when compared to either monomeric IgA or IgG with the same variable regions (Stubbe et al., 2000) . SIgA consists of the SC, two IgA molecules, and a linking chain. SC protects SIgA from proteolytic degradation (Kaetzel, 2005) , making the SIgA more stable. It has been estimated that approximately 3 g of SIgA is transported daily into the intestines of the average adult (Mestecky et al., 1986; Conley and Delacroix, 1987) , where SIgA forms the first line of antigen-specific immune protection against ingested, inhaled, or sexually transmitted pathogens and antigens at mucosal surfaces (Kaetzel, 2005) , making it more important than IgA. In this study, we investigated the SC portion to detect SIgA in colostrum samples, as this can eliminate the effect of monomeric IgA.",

The sensitivity of the strip was evaluated by comparing the detection of the same samples with PEDV SIgA ELISA Kit. The detection limit of the strip was evaluated by using PEDV SIgA positive-colostrum and colostrum titers determined by using an ELISA Kit (Cong et al., 2019) as the reference standard with minor modifications. In brief, sample buffer was used to dilute colostrum from 1:10 to 1:100, and 100 \u03bcL of the solution was added into microtiter plates (Costar, Corning, NY, USA) incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1h. After a washing step, a horseradish peroxidase mouse anti-pig SIgA secretory component (SC) antibody (1: 3,000 dilution) was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. After three times wash with PBST, the peroxidase reaction was visualized using 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (BBI, Shanghai, China) as the substrate for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, and the reaction was stopped by adding 50\u03bcl of 2.5 M sulfuric acid to each well. Optical densities (ODs) were measured at 405 nm using an ELISA plate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).For the sensitivity of the ELISA kit, one PEDV specific SIgA positive colostrum was still positive when diluted at 1: 6400. For the specificity, the ELISA kit has no cross-reaction with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f TGEV as well as PoRV specific SIgA positive colostrum(Cong et al., 2019).",
