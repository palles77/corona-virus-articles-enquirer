            "text": "Dampening of the renin-angiotensin signaling cascade (RAS) has proven invaluable in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Drugs that inhibit the M2 family dicarboxymetallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, EC 3.4.15.1) or the A1 family aspartic protease renin (EC 3.4.23.15), as well as those that antagonize the 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled angiotensin receptor II (AT 2 ), improve hypertension. Dual ACE and M13 metalloprotease neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin, NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) inhibition has also been explored for the treatment of high blood pressure. Recently, a new member of the RAS, the M2 family monocarboxymetallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was identified. 1, 2 It is a membraneassociated and secreted metalloprotease, expressed in heart, kidney, testes, intestine, and lung, with highest homology to ACE. ACE2 has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, obesity, and lung disease. [3] [4] [5] Angiotensin I and the AT 1 & AT 2 receptor agonist angiotensin II are substrates for ACE2, which converts them into angiotensin (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) and the mas receptor agonist angiotensin (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , respectively, revealing a role for ACE2 in RAS regulation. Moreover, ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice studies have revealed roles for this protease in cardiac contrac-tility, 6 angiotensin II-induced hypertension, 7 and heart failure. 8 Furthermore, male ACE2 (\u00c0/Y) mice, but not female ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice, also develop glomerulosclerosis of the kidneys, 9 but ACE2's exact role in the reninangiotensin system (RAS) still needs to be clarified. In addition, ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice are resistant to weight gain on a high fat diet. 10 Finally, ACE2 is the primary receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus's entry into cells. 11 ACE2 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice resist SARS corona virus infection. 12 Because of limited space, the authors refer the interested reader to a recent review by Hamming et al. for a more comprehensive summary of the physiology and pathology of ACE2. 13 With the many putative roles of ACE2, small molecule modulators of this enzyme's activity could be utilized to help further define the physiological functions of this enzyme. Although small molecule inducers of proteases are difficult to discover, ACE2 activators could provide further insight into the functions of ACE2 and the substrates it processes. Similarly, inhibitors could also shed more light on the roles of ACE2 and the proteins/peptides it activates/degrades. Efforts to discover ACE2 inhibitors have recently been disclosed. Millennium Pharmaceutical researchers reported the discovery of a reversible, subnanomolar ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 (IC 50 = 0.44 nM), derived from a micromolar lead. 14 In addition, Dyax researchers identified micromolar peptide inhibitors of ACE2 using a phage display library approach, including the 29 amino acid cyclic peptide DX600 (IC 50 = 10 nM). 15 Furthermore, a pharmacophore-based virtual screening approach of commercial databases identified several micromolar ACE2 inhibitors. The best inhibitor was 4S-16659 (IC 50 = 62,000 nM). 16 Finally, researchers at the University of Florida also utilized a virtual screening exercise of the NCI database to identify N-(2-aminoethyl)-1 aziridine-ethanamine (NAAE) (IC 50 = 57,000 nM) as an irreversible inhibitor of ACE2. 17",

            "text": "Recently, employing a directed screen of a set of metalloprotease inhibitors from the GlaxoSmithKline compound collection, GSK researchers reported the identification of a known ACE/NEP inhibitor as a potent inhibitor of the zinc metalloprotease ACE2. 18 Structure/activity studies of the S 1 subsite of ACE2 led to the identification of P 1 modified thiol acid 1a as a more potent ACE2 inhibitor (K i App = 1.5 nM) with improved selectivity versus ACE (K i App = 490 nM) and NEP (K i App = 27 nM). It also inhibits the M14 metalloprotease carboxypeptidase A1 (CpA, EC 3.4.17.1, K i App = 11,000 nM). Speculating that selectivity could be improved by exploiting potential differences in the S 1 0 subsites of ACE, ACE2, and NEP, the structureactivity relationships of the P 1 0 position of inhibitor 1a were explored, with the goal of maintaining potency and reducing ACE and NEP inhibitory activity. The thiol analogs 1a-1t were prepared as depicted in Scheme 1. The amine hydrochlorides 2a-2t were coupled to the acid 3, after its in situ activation to the aza-hydroxybenzotriazole ester via the carbodiimide, to produce the fully protected amides. Then, hydrolysis of the thioacetate and methyl ester with lithium hydroxide afforded the thiol acids 1a-1t. 19 Amine hydrochlorides 2a-2g, 2l, and 2o were commercially available. The remaining amine hydrochlorides 2h-2k, 2m-2n, and 2p-2t were prepared as depicted in Scheme 2. The commercially available amino acids 4a-4b were converted to their corresponding methyl esters with thionyl chloride and methanol at reflux. Then, the resulting amine hydrochlorides were protected as the tert-butyl carbamates 5a-5b with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. A Suzuki cross coupling of the o-bromide 5a (X = Br) with phenyl boronic acid afforded the o-biphenyl derivative 6a. Acid catalyzed cleavage of the carbamate gave the o-biphenyl amine hydrochloride 2h. The m-phenol 5b (X = OH) was converted into the triflate with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, and then coupled via the Suzuki protocol to phenyl boronic acid, providing the fully protected m-biphenyl derivative 6b. Subsequent hydrolysis of the amine masking group gave the m-biphenyl amine hydrochloride 2i. The o-bromide 5a (X = Br) was converted into the o-phenol 5c (X = OH) via palladium-mediated transformation of the bromide into a boronate ester, and then oxidation of the boronate to the phenol with hydrogen peroxide. Employing a modified Ullmann ether synthesis protocol, the o-phenol 5c and m-phenol 5b were coupled with phenyl boronic acid to afford the o-and m-diaryl ethers 6c and 6d. Acidic uncloaking of the tert-butyl carbonyl protecting group, then produced the phenyl ethers 2j and 2k. Finally, utilizing the Williamson ether synthesis, the o-phenol 5c, the m-phenol 5b, and the commercially available p-phenol 5d were alkylated with various benzyl bromides to give the fully masked benzyl aryl ethers 6e-6k. Then, unmasking of the carbamates afforded the amine hydrochlorides 2m-2n and 2p-2t.",

Complete removal of the P 1 0 substituent as in analog 1b resulted in a large decrease in ACE2 (K i App = 90 nM) and NEP (K i App = 5100 nM) inhibitory activity. The potential reduction in van der Waals interactions from the absence of a P 1 0 side chain as well as the entropic gain from increased rotational freedom of the acid could account for this decrease in potency. In contrast, this change had little affect on ACE (K i App = 250 nM) or CpA (K i App = 35,000 nM). The alanine-derived analog 1c (ACE2 K i App = 14 nM, NEP K i App = 950 nM) decreases rotational freedom and recovers some of the ACE2 inhibitory activity lost upon removal of the P 1 0 group, while not dramatically changing the activity versus ACE (K i App = 180 nM) or CpA (K i App = 11,000 nM). The phenylalanine and tyrosine derivatives 1d (K i App = 1.5 nM) and 1e (K i App = 1.3 nM) were equipotent ACE2 inhibitors to the methylene p-biphenyl analog 1a with similar ACE (1d K i App = 570 nM, 1e K i App = 410 nM) and NEP (1d K i App = 35nM, 1e K i App = 75 nM) activities as well. In contrast to 1a, the benzyl derivatives 1d and 1e were >10-fold more potent inhibitors of CpA (1d K i App = 530 nM, 1e K i App = 350 nM). Since many good CpA substrates contain P 1 0 phenylalanine residues, this increase in CpA inhibition for 1d and 1e is not surprising.",

It provides insight into the P 1 0 SAR of the thiol series. The terminal carboxylate of the inhibitor accepts hydrogen bonds from the imidazoles of 345 His and 505 His and forms a salt bridge to the guanidine of 273 Arg. Also, the amide nitrogen of the inhibitor donates a hydrogen atom to the carbonyl of 346 Pro, while the amide carbonyl accepts a hydrogen atom from 515 Tyr. Moreover, in addition to its normal ACE2 ligands, the imidazole nitrogens of 374 His and 378 His and the carboxylate of 402 Glu, the active site zinc coordinates the thiol of the inhibitor. Furthermore, the P 1 sec-butyl group of the inhibitor forms van der Waals interactions with the S 1 pocket composed of 347 Thr, 504 Phe, 510 Tyr, and 514 Arg. The greasy P 1 0 3,4-difluorobenzyltyrosine side chain of 1r forms significant lipophilic interactions with the quite large S 1 0 channel composed of the lengthwise canal between the two subdomains, including residues 274 Phe, 445 Thr, 406 Glu, Gln. Although several residues in this pocket are hydrophilic, most of the polar groups are either involved in hydrogen bonds with other enzyme residues or oriented away from the S 1 0 pocket, maintaining the lipophilic nature of this subsite. Based on this model, the 3,4-difluorobenzyl portion of the P 1 0 substituent is hypothesized to occupy a different part of this large pocket than the P 1 0 side chain of the carboxyl inhibitor MLN-4760 co-crystallized in 1R4L.",
