Coronaviruses are enveloped particles, which may be spherical (Coronavirinae), kidney-shaped (Torovirus) or bacilliform (Bafinivirus). The average diameter of coronaviruses ranges from 120 to 160 nm. Rod-shaped torovirus particles are 100-140 nm in length and 32-42 nm in width, whereas bafinivirus measures 150-185 \u00d7 57-70 nm ( Fig. 20 .1). The mean relative molecular mass (M r ) of coronavirus particles is 400 \u00d7 10 6 . The buoyant density of coronavirus in sucrose is 1.15-1.20 g/cm 3 , whereas that of torovirus and bafinivirus is 1.14-1.18 g/cm 3 and 1.17-1.19 g/cm 3 , respectively (de Groot et al., 2012a) .",

The envelope comprises a unit membrane, which bears club-shaped projections measuring 12-24 nm in length. These projections, which comprise spike (S) glycoprotein trimers, allow the virions to attach to specific receptors expressed on the plasma membrane of the host cell (Delmas and Laude, 1990) . A typical feature of coronaviruses is the formation of syncytia, which are induced by the S protein. Betacoronaviruses exhibit a second type of surface projection, which comprises a homodimeric hemaglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein; this protein also mediates receptor binding. Viruses expressing the HE protein bind to and agglutinate erythrocytes (Modrow et al., 2010) . The matrix (M) glycoprotein is located on the cytoplasmic side of the viral envelope and plays a central role in viral budding and contributes to the stability of the viral core structure (Escors et al., 2001a, b; Kuo and Masters, 2002) .",

            "text": "The first step of the infection cycle is attachment of a virion to its cognate cellular receptor. This step is mediated by the S glycoprotein. The conformation of the S glycoprotein changes upon binding, thereby promoting fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane (Lewicki and Gallagher, 2002; Belouzard et al., 2012) . Some coronaviruses require cleavage of the S glycoprotein for optimal fusion; however, noncleavage does not prevent fusion (Cavanagh, 2005) . After fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane, the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm. Virus replication takes place entirely within the cytoplasm of the infected cell. The first step involves attachment of the genomic RNA to ribosomes to facilitate synthesis of viral RdRp, which is encoded by ORF 1b. Structural proteins are produced from sg mRNAs. The viral replicase is encoded by two large ORFs, which overlap at the end of ORF 1a and the beginning of ORF 1b. A conserved \"slippery\" sequence comprising seven nucleotides is located upstream of a pseudoknot structure at the end of ORF 1a. This specific structure facilitates a ribosomal frame shift, resulting in the translation of two long polyproteins named pp1a and pp1ab. These large nonstructural proteins have never been observed in infected cells (de Groot et al., 2012a) . Co-and post-translational processing by viral proteinases generates a range of mature nonstructural proteins, including the replicative proteins. These enzymes and proteins are conserved within coronaviruses and are typical features of nidoviruses. The replicase complex produces complementary copies of the genome. The resulting negative-stranded RNA intermediates serve as template for the generation of positive-stranded viral RNA (genome replication) and for the synthesis of a 3\u02b9 co-terminal nested set of sg mRNAs (transcription) (Sawicki, 2009 ). The latter are polyadenylated at the 3\u02b9 terminus. With the exception of toroviruses, each sg mRNA carries a short 5\u02b9 leader sequence, which is identical to the 5\u02b9 end of the viral genome. In coronaviruses and bafiniviruses, transcription of genome templates is regulated by a short AU-rich sequence (transcription regulating sequence; TRS); however, in toroviruses, the process is regulated by putative terminator/promoter elements (TPs). The TRS and TPs are not equivalent in terms of function (de Groot et al., 2012a) . Coronaviruses and bafiniviruses generate mRNA via discontinuous synthesis, whereas toroviruses employ a mixed transcription procedure (Cavanagh, 2005; de Groot et al., 2012a,b) .",

It seems probable that the discovery of new nidoviruses will provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying recombination. Such discoveries will also further our understanding of viral evolution and improve taxonomic classification.",

Pathological sections from all three seals revealed extensive focal bronchoalveolar hemorrhage and edema, with severe diffuse pulmonary congestion. Moderate-to-severe lymphoid depletion was detected in the spleen and in visceral and peripheral lymphnodes. Coronavirus-specific antigens were detected in the intestinal mucosa. Immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against TGEV, FIPV and canine coronavirus (CCoV) (all alphacoronaviruses) yielded positive results, whereas immunofluorescence staining for bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (a betacoronavirus) was negative. Cross-reactivity among coronaviruses is limited to closely related species (de Groot et al., 2012b) .

Electron microscopic examination of liver tissue revealed a great number of round viral particles in the cytoplasm of hepatic cells. The estimated particle size (60-80 nm in diameter, with a core of 45-50 nm) differed markedly from that of known coronaviruses. Attempts to isolate the pathogen in noncongeneric cell lines failed, indicating that the virus had a specific host tropism. The viral genome was approximately 31.7 kb in size and encoded nonstructural (replicase; ORF 1a and 1b) and structural (S (ORF 2), E (ORF 3), M (ORF 4) and N (ORF 11)) proteins, which were flanked by UTRs. In addition, eight putative ORFs were localized between the genes coding the M and N proteins. The deduced amino acid sequences showed no similarity to proteins from known coronaviruses. Nevertheless, characteristic molecular features were identified: that is, transmembrane domains (ORFs 5 and 9), putative secretion signal sequences (ORFs 7 and 8) and a uridine kinase motif (ORF 10).

In contrast to the isolate from beluga whale, which caused liver damage, the BdCoV did not induce any clinical signs/symptoms, indicating an asymptomatic or mild infection. The viral genome was detected during the infectious stage, whereas N-specific antibodies were detected in serum samples at 4-8 weeks postinfection. The nearly identical viral genomes isolated from the three bottlenose dolphins belonged to the genus Gammacoronavirus.

            "text": "White bream virus (WBV) is the type species of the genus Bafinivirus within the subfamily Torovirinae. The name bafinivirus was coined because the virus shows bacilliform morphology (ba-) and is a fish (fi-) nidovirus (ni-). The pathogen was isolated from a healthy white bream (B. bjoerkna L.) caught in the Federal State of Saxonia-Anhalt in Germany during a program designed to monitor pathogens in wild freshwater fish (Granzow et al., 2001) . The virus replicates at 20-26\u00b0C in Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC; CCLV Rie 173), Blue gill fry (BF-2; CCLV Rie 290), fathead minnow (FHM; CCLV Rie 057) and carp pituitary (CaPi; CCLV Rie 112) cells and induces cytopathic effects. The pathogen is sensitive to chloroform. Viral particles exhibit ultrastructural features similar to those described for Roniviridae [eg, gill-associated virus (GAV-AUS) and yellow head virus (YHV)] isolated from prawns (Chantanachookin et al., 1993; Spann et al., 1997) . The mature enveloped virions measure 170-200 nm in length and 75-88 nm in diameter and are surrounded by fuzzy spikes approximately 20-25 nm long. The rigid rod-shaped nucleocapsid measures 120-150 \u00d7 19-22 nm and the buoyant density of the virus in sucrose is 1.17-1.19 g/cm 3 . The viral genome is 26.6 kb in length and encodes five ORFs, representing the large replicase gene and the structural proteins S, M and N. The virus does not encode a hemagglutinin esterase protein or a homolog of the coronavirus E protein. WBV exhibits molecular features typical of nidoviruses, including a polycistronic genome, the production of sg RNAs during transcription, RFS to express the replicase core domains at the translational level, and post-translational proteolytic processing of viral proteins (Schuetze et al., 2006) . Comparative sequence analyses showed that WBV is more closely related to toroviruses than to the other members of the order Nidovirales. Although WBV is related to toroviruses, it is different in several important aspects. First, WBV does not encode the structural gene HE. Second, all WBV sg RNAs possess a 5\u02b9 leader sequence, whereas three out of the four equine torovirus (strain Berne) sg RNAs lack a 5\u02b9 leader. Third, Bafinivirus does not encode cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, which is conserved in bovine and equine toroviruses. Fourth, the nonstructural gene products and the structural proteins M, N and S of WBV and torovirus are poorly conserved (Schuetze et al., 2006) . Finally, cyprinids are the natural hosts of WBV, whereas mammals are the natural hosts of toroviruses. Pathogens with similar morphological, physicochemical and genetic features to the WBV have been isolated from other cyprinids, including goldfish (Carassius a. auratus), tench (Tinca tinca) and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) (Fichtner et al., 2005) . Some fish suffer hemorrhage on the gills and skin, or ulceration of the skin. Cross-reactivity between anti-WBV antibodies and viral isolates from goldfish, tench and grass carp confirms a relationship between these pathogens. Other WBV-like pathogens were isolated from tench and carp after clinical events and fatalities in Germany in 2007 (Fichtner et al., 2009) . Infection of specific pathogen-free carp, goldfish and crucian carp (Carassius carassius) with a WBV-like pathogen isolated from a dead carp caused nonspecific clinical signs such as exhaustion, reduced food intake, increased mucus production, pseudofeces and petechiae. No mortalities were recorded (Fichtner et al., 2009) . Thus coronaviruses appear to be prevalent in cyprinids. Genomic analyses of these pathogens are necessary to confirm a relationship with bafinivirus WBV and to support a clear taxonomic classification of cyprinid coronaviruses. 20.3.4.1 Fathead Minnow Virus (FHMNV, An Unassigned Member of the Nidovirales) Fathead Minnow Virus (FHMNV) was first isolated from moribund fathead minnows (P. promelas) on a baitfish farm in central Arkansas in 1997 (Iwanowicz and Goodwin, 2002) . Affected fish exhibited hemorrhage of the skin and eyes, as well as hepatic, splenic and renal lesions. The virus replicates in EPC, FHM and RTG (rainbow trout gonad) cells between 15\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. A unique feature of this pathogen is the production of syncytia in both tissues and cell culture. The bacilliform particles measure 130-185\u00d731-47 nm. The complete genome sequence suggests that the virus belongs to the genus Torovirus (Batts et al., 2012) . The viral ssRNA is approximately 27 kb in length and displays the same genome organization as WBV, with molecular features typical of a nidovirus genome. Comparison of FHMNV helicase (pp1ab domain), S, M, N and ORF 1ab gene products with those of WBV reveals differing levels of homology, ranging from 15% (S protein) to 70% (helicase). The FHMNV pp1ab sequence is 11% homologous with that of equine arteritis virus, whereas the FHMNV helicase is 35% homologous with that of Equine torovirus (EToV). Phylogenetic analysis of the conserved helicase domain revealed that, although FHMNV is a distinct virus, it is the closest relative of WBV identified to date (Batts et al., 2012) .",

The enveloped particles have a bacilliform structure and are 45 nm in diameter and 120-130 nm in length. The virus possesses a genome of approximately 27 kb, with a gene organization consistent with that of bafiniviruses. Amino acid alignments suggest that this new virus is related to WBV and FHMV.",

The isolate, CIVH 33/86, multiplies in CAR cells (goldfish [Carassius auratus] fin cells), CLC cells (common carp [Cyprinus carpio] leukocytes) and FHM cells between 20\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. Infected cells fuse and then lyse. The virus is inactivated by chloroform, acid solutions (pH 3) and a temperature of 56\u00b0C. Treatment with 5-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) has no effect on viral replication. Treatment with acridine orange confirmed the presence of a singlestranded viral RNA genome. Electron micrographs revealed enveloped rod-shaped particles measuring 170-220 nm in length and 50-55 nm in width. Finally, the isolate exhibits morphological features consistent with those of toroviruses (Ahne et al., 1987) . Sano et al. (1988) isolated a coronavirus from a common carp that died after suffering an acute infection; clinical signs included erythema on the abdomen and hepatic and renal necrosis. The virus is transmitted to carp fry via the water at a temperature of 20 \u00b0C. The pathogen was isolated from the kidney, liver and spleen, and replicates in BF-2, EPC, RTG-2 and FHM cells at 20\u00b0C. The enveloped particles measure 60-100 nm in diameter.",

Necrotic lesions were observed in the visceral organs and virus particles were detected in hematopoietic tissue and spleen. The virus was resistant to IUdR, but sensitive to ether, suggesting that it was enveloped RNA virus. EPC cells were susceptible to infection at 25\u00b0C, but EK-1 (eel kidney), FHM, CHSE-214 (chinook salmon embryo) and RTG-2 cells were not. Infected EPC cells displayed karyopyknosis and intracytoplasmic vacuolization. The virus was round and displayed spike projections on the surface. The diameter of the virion ranged from 100 to 180 nm. Tubular structures (diameter, 60-70 nm) of various lengths and crystalline inclusions were observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells.",
