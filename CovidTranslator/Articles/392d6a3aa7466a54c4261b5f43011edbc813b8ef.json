            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes major public health problems worldwide. The clinical limitation of current antiviral drugs for HBV, such as lamivudine, is the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains during prolonged antiviral therapy. Cepharanthine hydrochloride (CH), a natural alkaloid-derived compound, has been reported to possess potent activity against various viruses. The present study was performed to evaluate the in vitro activity of CH against clinical wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates in transiently transfected cells. HBV DNA was extracted from serum samples collected both before lamivudine therapy and at the time of viral breakthrough and was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplicons were cloned into a novel expression vector, pHY106, which can initiate the intracellular HBV replication cycle after cell transfection. Following transfection of the cloned amplicon into HepG2 cells, a drug susceptibility assay was performed. The level of viral antigen, HBeAg, was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) was used for determining the amount of intracellular HBV DNA. Heat stress cognate 70 (Hsc70), a host protein required for HBV replication, was also analyzed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to explore the possible antiviral mechanism of CH. The results showed that CH inhibited replication and HBeAg production by either wild-type or lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates in a dose-dependent manner. The Hsc70 mRNA was also downregulated significantly. In conclusion, CH is active against both wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV clinical isolates, and its activity may be associated with its inhibition of host Hsc70.",

            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes the major public health problems worldwide. Over the past two decades, the prognosis of chronic hepatitis B has been significantly improved due to the emergence of two formulations of interferon and five orally administered nucleos(t)ide analogs (Yuen and Lai, 2011) . However, the prolonged use of nucleos(t)ide analogs frequently result in the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants, which are responsible for therapeutic failure and progression of liver disease (Hongthanakorn et al., 2011) . It is reported that up to 76% of the patients developed viral resistance after 5 years of lamivudine therapy (Yuen et al., 2009) . The signature mutations rtM204V/I, which have been mapped in the conserved tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif within the C domain of the reverse transcriptase (RT), are frequently associated with lamivudine resistance (Allen et al., 1998) . Furthermore, they are often associated with the compensatory mutations rtL180M or rtV173L in the B domain of the RT, which partially restore the replicative capacity of the YMDD mutation strains (Delaney et al., 2003; Enomoto et al., 2007) . One in vitro study demonstrated that drug susceptibility decreased over 10,000-fold once lamivudine-resistant HBV mutants were selected (Lada et al., 2004) . Moreover, the rapid progression or acute exacerbation of hepatitis usually occurs after the emergence of lamivudine resistance (Suzuki et al., 2006) . Thus, the discovery and development of novel anti-HBV drugs with innovative targets are urgently needed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, especially for rescue therapy of drug-resistant patients.",

Cepharanthine hydrochloride (CH) is a compound manufactured by salification from cepharanthine, which is a natural biscoclaurine alkaloid extracted from Stephania cepharantha Hayata. CH has attracted increasing scientific attention in recent years due to the extent of its biological activities, including antitumor, antiviral and anti-inflammatory actions, and its ability to promote leukocyte, induce apoptosis and reverse multidrug resistance induced by long-European Journal of Pharmacology 683 (2012) 10-15 term chemotherapy (Rogosnitzky and Danks, 2011) . With regard to the antiviral activity of CH, thus far there have been several reports on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Baba et al., 2001) , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Zhang et al., 2005) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Liu et al., 2004) . However, the in vitro anti-HBV activity of CH has never been explored until our recent unpublished observations demonstrated that CH was an efficient inhibitor of wild-type HBV in the stable HBV-producing cell line HepG2.2.15.",

Unfortunately, the patient's serum HBV DNA rebounded to 4.8\u00d7 10 6 copies/ml after a total of 16 months of lamivudine monotherapy, and continued to rise to the initial level 3 months later.

The levels of Hsc70 mRNA were quantified and normalized relative to the internal reference GAPDH mRNA (C and D). The experiments were performed in triplicate, and a representative set of data is presented. **P b 0.01, *P b 0.05 compared with the no drug control group. a laboratory strain would not contain the natural genetic context of a mutation identified in clinical strains, and discrepancies between the susceptibilities to antivirals of laboratory-and patient-derived HBV mutants will emerge (Brunelle et al., 2007) . Therefore, phenotypic analysis of HBV clinical mutants isolated directly from the sera of patients would offer more relevant and accurate information than that obtained from testing viruses with mutations introduced into laboratory strains.",

The novel plasmid pHY106 contains 180 bp of HBV sequences, which are highly conserved among various HBV genotypes, and contains two SapI sites, allowing insertion of the SapI treated PCR-amplified HBV genome, leading to a 1.1-unit length of HBV genome which is necessary and sufficient to enable the synthesis of full-length HBV pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) required to trigger the intracellular HBV cycle (Seeger and Mason, 2000) . In the present study, the full-length HBV genome, amplified with high-fidelity PCR polymerase from the serum of a chronic hepatitis B patient who had developed resistance to lamivudine, was cloned to pHY106 and used for drugs susceptibility testing. The sequences of our individual clone matched that of its respective patient serum HBV, indicating that the constructed individual clone represented the dominant serum HBV quasispecies population. Thus, the drug susceptibility results obtained in this report would precisely reflect those of the serum HBV itself.",

In the present study, after transient transfection with the rtV173L/L180M/M204V triple mutant, HepG2 cells secreted HBsAg at an extremely low level, even in the no drug control group. Thus, HBsAg was excluded from the antigen criterion for evaluating the susceptibility of the triple mutant to antivirals.

In the present study, we confirmed the findings of previous studies, which showed that CH is a potent inhibitor of wild-type HBV in vitro. In HepG2 cells transiently transfected with the wild-type HBV genome, CH inhibited HBV replication and HBeAg expression more efficiently than adefovir, while lamivudine displayed the most potent antiviral activity. Moreover, we provided new information that showed that CH inhibited the replication and HBeAg production of clinical lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates almost as efficiently as it did that of wild-type HBV. The in vitro cross-resistance profile of CH for the lamivudine-resistant variant studied here proved to be more favorable than that of lamivudine and comparable to that of adefovir.",

Interestingly, the cytotoxicity assay indicated that CH and adefovir had similar cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells. Thus, in combination with the antiviral capacity profile of compounds tested, it can be concluded that CH has more favorable therapeutic potency than adefovir.",

Recently, researchers have found that Hsc70 is a host protein associated with HBV replication and could be therapeutic target of some natural anti-HBV compounds (Wang et al., , 2011 . To gain new insights into the mechanism of inhibition of HBV by CH, we assessed the effect of in vitro CH treatment on host Hsc70 mRNA by RT-PCR. The results showed that CH inhibited host Hsc70 mRNA expression in parallel with the inhibitory effect on intracellular HBV replication, illustrating that CH may suppress HBV via downregulation of host Hsc70 expression. We also investigated the potential influence of the knockdown of the Hsc70 mRNA on the host cells. Interestingly, the reduction of Hsc70 mRNA by CH did not cause apparent negative effects on the growth of human HepG2 cells (unpublished observations). Nevertheless, the downregulation of the protein and the exact mechanism of the downregulation of Hsc70 by CH deserve further studies. Furthermore, the effects of CH on other ATP-binding protein of the heat stress protein like Hsp90 or chaperone proteins like p23 Hsp40 or Hop involved in HBV replication also merit investigations.",
