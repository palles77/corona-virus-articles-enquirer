Therefore, each stage of these steps of the virus life cycle can be targets for therapeutic inhibition. Screening of FDA-approved drugs for MERS-CoV identified many drugs with antiviral effects. 5,6 These drugs can be categorized into inhibitors disrupting endocytosis, interrupting MERS-CoV RNA replication and translation, and inhibitors with undefined mechanisms. To date, there are still no approved antiviral drugs. 2 Therefore, the development of therapeutics against MERS has received more and more attention.",

Therefore, each stage of these steps of the virus life cycle can be targets for therapeutic inhibition. Screening of FDA-approved drugs for MERS-CoV identified many drugs with antiviral effects. 5, 6 These drugs can be categorized into inhibitors disrupting endocytosis, interrupting MERS-CoV RNA replication and translation, and inhibitors with undefined mechanisms. To date, there are still no approved antiviral drugs. 2 Therefore, the development of therapeutics against MERS has received more and more attention.",
