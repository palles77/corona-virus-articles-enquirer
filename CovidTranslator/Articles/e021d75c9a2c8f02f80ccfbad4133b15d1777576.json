            "text": "Many new infectious diseases in humans have been derived from animal sources in the past 20 years. Some are highly contagious and fatal. Vaccination may not be available and antiviral drugs are not effective enough. Infectious control is important in clinical medicine and in Ophthalmology. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), as an example, is a highly contagious respiratory disease that has recently been reported in Asia, North America, and Europe. Within a matter of weeks, the outbreak has evolved to become a global health threat and more than 30 countries have been afflicted with a novel Coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV) that is the aetiologic agent of SARS. The primary route of transmission of SARS appears involving close person-toperson contact through droplets. Ophthalmologists may be particularly susceptible to the infection as routine ophthalmic examinations like direct ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination are usually performed in a setting that has close doctor-patient contact. Being the Ophthalmology Department of the only hospital in the world that has just gone through the largest outbreak of SARS, we would like to share our strategy, measures, and experiences of preventing contracting or spreading of SARS infection as an infection control model. SARS is one of the many viruses against which personnel will need protecting in an ophthalmic setting. The experiences attained and the measures established might also apply to other infectious conditions spreading by droplets such as the avian influenza with H5N1.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] The culprit virulent agent is believed to be a novel Coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV) that is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and local infection control experts. 4, 5 The awful impact of this disease can be reflected by the alarming health-care statistics recorded since the massive outbreak in Hong Kong on March 12, 2003 . The accumulative number of SARS infection by October 15, 2003 was 1755 with a total number of deaths of 299 and among them eight of the deceased were doctors, nurses, and health-care assistants. 7 SARS has unveiled many virgin health-care issues that have not caught the attention of the general public in the past and the whole healthcare system in Hong Kong has been significantly percolated and bombarded by SARS in terms of changes in daily practices and everyday routines. Ophthalmology is no exception. The Ophthalmologist, as one of the frontline health-care providers, has to inevitably face these new challenges and the ever-changing expectation upon our profession from patients and the community. Several clinical problems are particularly pertaining to the ophthalmic practice. Firstly, what we can be certain right now is that this novel Coronavirus-associated atypical pneumonia is extremely infectious as reflected by the high prevalence of infected health-care workers. By October 15, 2003 , 386 of 1755 patients (21.9%) were health-care workers of hospitals/clinics or medical students. Most of them had a history of close contact with known or finally known SARS patients. 7 It is still unclear whether ophthalmologists are at increased risk of infection in examining a proven or suspected SARS patient with short working distance, especially in performing direct ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination.",

Stool and urine have also been implicated as the possible media in harboring the infective agent. [1] [2] [3] Tears and eye discharges are body secretions that may be equally or potentially more hazardous to health-care personnel, particularly ophthalmologists. In fact, tears have been reported by WHO to be one of the body fluids conveying the novel SARS-CoV, although the infectivity or clinical significance is still not known for the time being. 8 The use of different instruments, which are in direct contact with patients' conjunctival mucosal surface may serve as possible routes and sources for disease transmission. The ultimate infectivity of the tears secretion and ocular discharge from SARS patients may bring impacts on not only the daily ophthalmic practice but also the universal infection control measures practiced by general public and health-care workers.",

Supplementary oxygen was required to alleviate the shortness of breath and oxygen desaturation. Chest radiography showed bilateral lung parenchymal infiltrates without consolidation. Respiratory physician recognized her condition as a probable case of SARS that required Intensive Care Unit admission with ventilatory support. At 3 days prior to the present admission, she had been seen by two of our colleagues in the outpatient consultation room. Immediate notification of the Infection Control Unit of the hospital was performed. The SARS Command Centre of the Department of Health of Hong Kong and the Hospital Authority consisting of infection disease clinicians, microbiologists, and epidemiologists were notified as well. In accordance with the infection surveillance protocol, the clinic doctors and nurses, who had a close contact with the patients, were required to have compulsory blood check for cell counts and chest radiography despite the fact that they did not exhibit any symptoms on initial assessment. The investigations were normal but they still have to be put on home quarantine for 7 days. Subsequently, the policy was further geared up to 10 days home quarantine for those health-care workers having unprotected contacts of similar setting. The diagnosis of the patient was finally revised and confirmed to be lupus pneumonitis with systemic flare-up. She succumbed on day 11 after admission. With such an experience, we have consolidated both the infection control and containment measures with respect to in-patient and outpatient ophthalmic services.",

Suboptimal infection control strategies in the clinic may inadvertently help the spread of SARS infection and jeopardize the whole community infection containment policy. We have used modified WHO cases classification schemes in handling our eye patients in the clinic. Three categories of patients are recognized based on a triage system run by experienced nurses. They are the general, suspect, and probable categories. [3] [4] [5] General categories In attending all ophthalmic outpatients, irrespective of their SARS status, staff are encouraged to follow the universal precaution measures consisting of wearing surgical/N95 respirator mask, wearing gloves in handling blood, body fluids, secreta and excreta, wearing water-repellant or water-resistant gowns and goggles (visor) during splashes or sprays generating procedures such as measuring noncontact tonometry (NCT) ( Table 1 ). The most important of all is frequent hand washing, preferably with the use of chlorhexidine alcoholic handrub (0.5-1.0% chlorhexidine in 80% ethyl alcohol, or a similar commercial product, such as Hexol s ) in the prevention of crossinfection. The gloves, if used for high-risk procedures, must be changed and hand hygiene must be performed in between each contact with different patients. Staff are strongly advised not to touch their face-shield, eye protective wear, mask, head, and neck region before a thorough and complete hand washing procedure. Visitors are restricted in the hospital or clinic complexes unless under exceptional circumstances such as the escort of demented or visually impaired patients or parents of small children. 3 Suspect and probable categories For known cases of SARS inpatients, the outpatient attendance is deemed contraindicated because of significant risk of crossinfection. Any ophthalmic consultation should be completed within the quarantine ward instead. If an outpatient presented with overt SARS symptoms and signs, immediate attention from the respiratory physicians and infection control officers should be summoned. The ophthalmic appointment should be deferred indefinitely until the status of infection is ascertained.",

The personal protective equipment (PPE) with disposable caps, N95 respirator, goggles, face-shields, gloves, top and pants, and long protective gowns with high neck and long cuffed sleeves should be worn all the time when attending to these patients (Table 1) . Under circumstances such as between cases and immediately following a high-risk procedure, all health-care workers have to abide by the decontamination process consisting of removal of all potentially contaminated protective wear in proper sequence and putting on clean protective wear.

The strong survival ability of SARS-CoV over surfaces of commonly used materials in domestic and working environments have been quantitatively proved by in vitro models. 9 Therefore, the disinfection of the ophthalmic instruments as well as the environmental surfaces in frequent contact with patients are deemed as one of the key infection containment measures. Susceptibility of human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 to chemical disinfection has been demonstrated by biological viral titration assay, 10, 11 whereas similar in vitro data concerning the efficacy of different hospital disinfectant products (US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registered disinfectants) against this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is currently lacking. 12 Nevertheless, we can still make use of the available chemical germicides that could inactivate related viruses with similar physical and biochemical properties as the possible SARS agents. The adopted disinfection protocols in our ophthalmic practice are in line with the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention 13 and based on the scientific evidences provided by APIC guidelines. 14 Ophthalmic instruments especially those in direct contact with patients' mucosal membranes like the Goldmann applanation prism tip and Goldmann contact lens require intermediate level of disinfection. 14 They should be immediately and separately disinfected with 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde (Cidex s ) for 20 min at room temperature or 6% hydrogen peroxide after use. 14 Frequent (at least daily) disinfection of the apparatus (slit lamp, binocular indirect ophthalmoscope, etc) with hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution (1000 ppm, 1 in 50 dilution of 5.25 % household bleach, for 2 min) is mandatory. 14 The examination table and slit lamp will be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly before another patient is seen in that environment. Surfaces that cannot be easily cleaned, such as keyboards of desktop computers, should be covered within plastic sheeting, wiped between cases, and changed at the end of the day. If the plastic wraps are grossly soiled with patient's tears or ocular secretion, they should be immediately removed and replaced. Daily cleaning and disinfection of the environmental surfaces (eg, door knobs, phone, lavatory facilities) that have been frequently touched by patients and health-care workers are specifically targeted, in accordance with the recommendations by the CDC. 12, 13 Unless it is otherwise indicated, the consultation waiting time and overall consultation time ought to be maintained at a safe minimum. After all, the outpatient attendance should be judiciously kept at a low level so as to curtail the risk of crossinfection.",

The cumulative numbers of probable SARS worldwide by Sept 26, 2003 was 8098, in which 1707 (21%) were health-care workers. A total of 774 patients died from the disease with a fatality ratio of 9.6%. 19 It was first recognized as a global threat in mid-March 2003, but was successfully contained in less than 4 months with international cooperation. On 5 July 2003, WHO reported that the last human chain of transmission of SARS had been broken. 20 The epidemic, however, is not yet over. Firstly, sporadic confirmed and probable SARS-CoV infection have been reported and it is important to note that the source of infection in the most recent case is still unknown. 21 Secondly, even with the aid of molecular epidemiological techniques such as genetic fingerprinting, the natural reservoir, host, vector and media of transmission of SARS-CoV, is still enigmatic to mankind. 22, 23 Owing to lack of a clear understanding of the epidemiological characteristics, a complete eradication of the SARS-CoV is remote and the world anticipates ongoing new cases. Thirdly, mutation analysis has demonstrated continuous evolutional change of the genetic constitutions of SARS-CoV, which may encourage emergence of more virulent strains in a community without immunity against this pathogen. 24 With an interference of the human-animal ecology, more new virulent species are imminent, SARS-CoV infection is an example, and avian-flu is another. Countries that were not involved during the heat of the outbreak have recently stepped up this national SARS preventive measures. 25 In the postoutbreak period, all health-care workers, including ophthalmologists, should remain vigilant for the recurrence of SARS and always incorporate risk-based infection control measures in care provision.",

The experiences we have learnt also apply to other highly infectious disease, which can be spread by means of droplets. 26 Avian influenza A (H5N1) is an example. 27 It is a viral infection that can affect humans and cause serious disease and death. 27, 28 There is still no solid evidence of human-to-human transmission in most of the outbreaks involving human cases. 27 However, a recent clustering of cases in a family, probably resulting from person-to-person transmission during unprotected exposure to the critically ill index patient was recorded. 28 These findings indicate that inefficient transmission is possible and reinforce the importance of infection control precautions among health-care workers. 29 If H5 viruses do persist, they will likely continue to evolve, or reassort with existing human influenza viruses, to become more virulent and more easily transmitted subtypes from person-to-person. 26, 30 We must be well prepared for any H5N1 outbreaks as it is difficult to eradicate the existing virus in nature with the potential reservoirs in wild birds. 30 Strict adoption of the regularly revised infection control guidelines in accordance to the updated clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory information is the only way to prevent further large-scale hospital outbreak or crossinfection.",
