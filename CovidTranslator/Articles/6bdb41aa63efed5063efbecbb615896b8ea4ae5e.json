Despite their importance, the evolution and function of overlapping genes are often not well understood, in part due to difficulties in their detection. In addition, most bioinformatic approaches for the detection of overlapping genes require the comparison of multiple genome sequences that may not be available in metagenomic surveys of virus biodiversity. We introduce a simple new method for identifying candidate functional overlapping genes using single virus genome sequences. Our method uses randomization tests to estimate the expected length of open reading frames and then identifies overlapping open reading frames that significantly exceed this length and are thus predicted to be functional. We applied this method to 2548 reference RNA virus genomes and find that it has both high sensitivity and low false discovery for genes that overlap by at least 50 nucleotides. Notably, this analysis provided evidence for 29 previously undiscovered functional overlapping genes, some of which are coded in the antisense direction suggesting there are limitations in our current understanding of RNA virus replication.",

            "text": "Gene overlap occurs when two or more genes share the same region of a nucleotide sequence in a genome. This occurs frequently in viruses, especially those with RNA genomes, but has also been observed in bacteria and in eukaryotes including humans (Smith et al. 1977; Keese and Gibbs 1992; Veeramachaneni et al. 2004; Nakayama et al. 2007 ). The high prevalence of gene overlap in viruses has been attributed to two complementary theories: gene \"compression\" and gene \"novelty.\" Compression theory argues that the size of viral genomes is constrained by factors such as high mutation rates and the small capsid structure housing the genetic material. This constrained genome size subsequently exerts selection pressure on genes to overlap to maximize genetic potential (Belshaw et al. 2007; Chirico et al. 2010) . Gene novelty theory asserts that the constrained nature of viral genomes, combined with their limited noncoding regions, makes the generation of new genes difficult without major changes in genomic structure or input from the host genome. Mutations in current genes that generate a new open reading frame (ORF) then allow the generation of new genes within an established older gene in a process called \"overprinting\" (Keese and Gibbs 1992; Sabath et al. 2012; Brandes and Linial 2016) . These theories are not mutually exclusive and both processes may be operating in virus genomes. Overlapping genes may also function as a mechanism for regulating gene expression and reduce the probability of mutation fixation in overlapping areas as the resident genes may have competing selection pressures (Krakauer 2000; Dreher and Miller 2006) . Due to these evolutionary constraints, overlapping genes frequently encode proteins with accessory functions that play important roles in pathogenicity or spread (Rancurel et al. 2009 ).",

            "text": "Overlapping genes were first detected following the discovery that the cumulative length of protein sequences in bacteriophage u174 exceeded the length of the genome (Barrell et al. 1976 ). Today, the detection of overlapping genes still largely relies on laboratory methods that isolate, sequence, and align individual proteins to reference genomes (Fellner et al. 2015) . These and other potential laboratory methods such as ribosome profiling (Irigoyen et al. 2016) are costly and time intensive, making large scale screening and identification of overlapping genes expensive. Necessarily, these factors have led to the development of bioinformatics and theoretical methods for the analysis of overlapping genes that rely on genome sequence analyses alone. For example, synonymous sites that exhibit a reduced nucleotide substitution rate are indicative of functional overlapping proteins; because these substitutions affect two proteins they are usually expected to be deleterious and hence are observed at a reduced rate (Firth and Brown 2005, 2006; Jagger et al. 2012) .

For example, the reverse complementary nucleotide sequence for two adjacent tyrosines (TAT/C and TAT/C) will be A/GTA and A/GTA, which always creates a stop codon (either a TAA or TAG after a reading frame shift of 1 nucleotide). Although these properties help in the development of bioinformatics techniques to discover unknown overlapping genes, they are restricted by their requirement for multiple genomic sequences or by their poor sensitivity. With the rapid rise of metagenomics to discover new viruses (Bekal et al. 2011; Ballinger et al. 2014; Shi et al. 2016 Shi et al. , 2018 , efficient and sensitive approaches of identifying overlapping genes that require genome sequence information alone will be essential.",

We apply this method to a large scale computational screening of all available (linear) RNA virus genomes. The method estimates the theoretical expected length of ORFs before a stop codon is reached in all reading frames within an established gene. If an ORF exists of much greater length than predicted by this expected length, then we surmise that there has been selection against the accumulation of stop codons that shorten the putative ORF. We conclude that this constitutes evidence that the ORF in question provides functional benefit to the virus. Despite its simplicity, we show that this method is a powerful way to detect functional overlapping genes that can be readily applied to large scale computational screening of all known viruses and to viruses newly discovered through metagenomics.",

Accordingly, the length of ORFs (as measured by the distance between bookend stop codons) is likely to be larger when they are functional than what would be expected by random chance alone where stop codons could be introduced without penalty. Hence, the defining characteristic of our method for the detection of overlapping genes is identifying ORFs larger than expected by chance alone (fig. 1A ). We developed three tests for estimating the distribution of expected ORF lengths. Briefly, in the first test, we estimate the expected length of ORFs by permuting codon positions in the original reading frame and then measuring ORF lengths in other reading frames. This process is repeated to generate an expected distribution of ORF lengths (codon permutation test, fig. 1B ). In the second test, instead of permuting codon positions, the codon order is unchanged and nucleotide substitutions that would introduce synonymous mutations in the original reading frame are randomly generated (synonymous mutation test, fig. 1C ), before measuring ORF lengths in the other reading frames. In the third test, referred to as the combined test, the P values for both the codon permutation test and the synonymous mutation test must fall below some cut-off value.",

ORFs longer than expected by random chance are identified. The expected ORF length is estimated by one of three tests. For the codon permutation test (B) the codon sequence on the original frame is permuted and ORF lengths on alternative reading frames measured for each permutation. For the synonymous mutation test (C), codons that preserve the original amino acid sequence are randomly generated and the length of ORFs on alternative reading frames subsequently measured (note that codon replacement is not restricted to the example mutations shown in the figure, all of which occur in the third nucleotide positions, and that codon replacement with the original codon is also possible). The third test requires both the codon permutation test and the synonymous mutation test P values to be below some cut-off value.",

The area under the curve here will lie between 0 and 1, with a value of 0.5 indicating a screening tool of no benefit, and a value of 1 indicating a perfect screening tool with no error.

Although powerful, this method is necessarily constrained by the requirement for multiple sequences of sufficient diversity to robustly detect overlapping genes. In contrast, our method requires only a single sequence, and can therefore be applied in many situations where Synplot2 would be inviable. Quantitative comparisons of sensitivity and false discovery between the methods are difficult, as the factors associated with sensitivity in Synplot2 (sequence diversity, recombination, and window size) are not present in our method. Therefore, to make this comparison informative, we apply our method to the Synplot2 validation data set (table 1 from Firth 2014) and report the results in table 2. This validation consists of 21 gene overlaps with a minimum overlap length of 108 nucleotides. We find that using a P value cut of value of 0.01, the codon permutation method, synonymous mutation method, and combined approach detects 12, 12, and 10 of the gene overlaps, respectively. These results are in agreement with our previous sensitivity estimates. For example, Figure 3 shows that the combined approach will have $50% sensitivity for overlaps of at least 100 nucleotides when a P value cut-off of 0.01 is used.",

Of these 40 ORFs, two had been previously described in Synplot2's RNA screening in 2014 (Firth 2014 MBE not annotated within GenBank, they were not necessarily undiscovered, as some existed within the NCBI protein databases. To remove these already discovered or hypothesized overlapping ORFs, we performed a protein BLAST search of the 38 undocumented overlapping ORFs and found that nine had previously been discovered but were not annotated within the reference genome, thereby leaving 29 newly discovered functional overlapping ORFs from our method (table 3, supplementary materials S2 and S5, Supplementary Material online). Of these newly discovered ORFs, we would expect approximately three to be false discoveries. To test if we can detect homologs of the 29 newly discovered overlaps in other species, we aligned their protein sequence against the NCBI nt database using tblastn (supplementary material S4, Supplementary Material online).

The method assumes that functional ORFs are longer than expected by random chance as they experience selective pressure against mutations that introduce stop codons. We quantify this by using three ways to estimate the null distribution for ORFs lengths within each reading frame of a gene, and use the null to identify those ORFs significantly longer than predicted by random chance. This approach has a number of advantages over current bioinformatics methods to detect overlapping genes. In addition to being simple and quick, it only requires a single genome sequence. This is in contrast to other bioinformatic methods that require multiple sequences to estimate and compare nucleotide or codon diversity. This feature allows the method to be applied much more broadly in both metagenomics projects where genomes of new viruses are frequently only present in a single copy (Bekal et al. 2011; Ballinger et al. 2014; Shi et al. 2016) , and also in screening scenarios such as demonstrated herein. The method is best suited to refine regions of the genome that contain candidates for functional overlapping genes, after which these regions can be further tested for functionality with more resource intensive laboratory methods such as protein isolation, ribosomal profiling (Michel et al. 2012; Ingolia 2016) , and studying the effects of introduced knock out mutations (Chung et al. 2008) .",

            "text": "A second important feature of our method is the relatively high sensitivity to detect overlapping genes, whilst maintaining acceptable false discovery rates. This is best achieved by using the combined test where newly detected ORFs must be larger than expected by both the codon permutation and synonymous mutation tests. The combined test is advantageous as true positives are readily detected by both tests, so the constraint of requiring both tests to detect the ORF does not impact the sensitivity. However, the combined test does substantially reduce the false positives rate, as false positives detected by one test are frequently excluded by the other. There is also scope to further reduce false discovery by modifying our method, or by imposing post analysis constraints, for example by calculating ORF lengths from start codon to stop codon rather than between two stop codons. This was not considered for the screening results here due to variation in alternative start codons among viruses, but would be an important optimization in more targeted screening. One caveat to this method (and other bioinformatics approaches) is that sensitivity depends on the size of overlap, with smaller regions of overlap being more difficult to detect. Unlike other methods, however, we explicitly calculated the sensitivity for many lengths of overlap and find that a length of at least 50 nucleotides (17 codons) is required before the method becomes effective. As this length increases to 300 nucleotides (100 codons), the method becomes a very powerful diagnostic tool as measured by an area under the curve equal to 0.89. The estimate of this method's sensitivity and false discovery rates for an overlapping gene detection method is a strength, as although sensitivity can be calculated for other methods, false discovery estimation is often neglected and rarely reported due to a lack of negative controls. When it is reported, it is usually based on estimates of type 1 error rates of P values, rather than comparison to a negative control as we have done in here.",

This provided evidence for 29 undocumented overlapping ORFs of which we expect only 3 to be false positives, although all should be verified experimentally. One notable ORF identified here is the exceptionally long (708 codons) antisense ORF in Nhumirim virus, a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus from the family Flaviviridae, which suggests that this virus may employ a novel method of transcription and clearly merits further investigation. We also identified several undiscovered ORFs in the phosphoprotein P within the Paramyxoviridae family, a region known to frequently contain overlapping genes in other reading frames due to RNA editing. Within Bovine respirovirus virus 3, the ORF codon sequence discovered here aligned with many V proteins of other members of the Paramyxoviridae. As the V protein in these viruses also overlaps with the phosphoprotein P protein, this suggests that the V protein also exists in Bovine respirovirus virus 3. In other Paramyxoviridae, notably Tioman virus, we also identified antisense ORFs in the phosphoprotein.",

            "text": "The detection of 17 antisense ORFs is notable. Antisense overlaps have been shown to exist in a number viruses that use DNA as a replication intermediate including those in the Herpesviridae (Ward et al. 1996) , REP/ORF3 in Porcine Schlub et al. . doi:10.1093/molbev/msy155 MBE circovirus 2 (He et al. 2012 ) and HBZ/p12 and HBZ/p30 in Human T lymphotropic virus 1 (Arnold et al. 2006) . They are also suspected to occur in many more viruses with DNA intermediaries, including a long suspected antisense protein (asp) in HIV-1 (Torresilla et al. 2015; Cassan et al. 2016 ). In addition, they have been infrequently suggested to occur in RNA viruses that do not use DNA intermediates, such as a more than 100 amino acid (a) overlapping antisense hypothetical protein in Rice black streaked dwarf virus (dsRNA) (Zhang et al. 2001 ), a 96 aa overlapping antisense hypothetical protein in Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Mammarenavirus (-ssRNA) (Salvato et al. 1989) , and a possible 167 aa overlapping antisense ORF called \"NEG8\" in human influenza A virus (Clifford et al. 2009; Sabath et al. 2011) . Our method can be used to investigate these further. For example, in the case of NEG8 we find that a 167 codon ORF on in the NEG8 reading frame (\u00c0c2) is highly statistically unlikely by both the codon permutation and synonymous mutation methods, providing further evidence for a functional benefit of this ORF. Interestingly, however, a further frameshift of 1 nucleotide (frame \u00c0c1) would make ORFs of such lengths much more likely (P \u00bc 0.02 and 0.03 for codon permutation and synonymous mutation methods respectively), demonstrating the importance of the expected ORF lengths on every individual reading frame, rather than just the sense direction. Furthermore, when applying our method to HIV-1, we find that the possible antisense ORF (asp) is not substantially longer than expected by chance alone (P \u00bc 0.06 and P \u00bc 0.04 for codon permutation and synonymous mutation methods, respectively) in that reading frame.",
