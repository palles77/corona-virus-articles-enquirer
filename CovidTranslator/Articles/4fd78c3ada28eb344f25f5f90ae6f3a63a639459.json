In other vertebrates, early responses to viral infection involve engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which induce changes in gene expression collectively leading to an \"antiviral state\". In this study we report the cloning and bioinformatic analysis of a complete set of TLRs from the black flying fox Pteropus alecto, and perform quantitative tissue expression analysis of the nucleic acid-sensing TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9. Full-length mRNA transcripts from TLRs homologous to human TLRs 1-10 were sequenced, as well as a nearly intact TLR13 pseudogene that was spliced and polyadenylated. This prototype data can now be used to design functional studies of the bat innate immune system. Crown",

            "text": "Although many of the viruses carried by bats are highly pathogenic in other mammals, experimental infections and virus isolation studies have demonstrated that infected bats rarely display clinical symptoms associated with disease (Williamson et al., 1998; Calisher et al., 2006; Middleton et al., 2007; Towner et al., 2009) . One unique aspect of bat biology that may be related to the role of bats as viral reservoirs was revealed in a recent study of bat DNA transposons. In contrast to other mammalian lineages, in which it was widely believed that DNA transposon activity had ceased at least 40 million years ago, multiple waves of extensive and recent DNA transposon activity were identified in the genomes of two microbat species. Speculating upon a possible connection with the ability of bats to withstand viral infections, the authors proposed either a general tolerance of bats for \"genomic parasitises\", or that the extensive acquisition of DNA transposons may in fact be a consequence of bats' tolerance of viruses (Ray et al., 2007 (Ray et al., , 2008 . In contrast to bats' seeming ability to withstand viruses, some hibernating species are highly vulnerable to fungal infections, as seen by the emergence of white nose syndrome in North America (Blehert et al., 2009) . As a result of these observations, the question has been raised of whether bat immune systems may be qualitatively different to other mammals, particularly in response to viral infections. However, few studies have examined the innate or adaptive mechanisms involved in resistance to viral infection in any species of bat.",

TLRs are considered by many to be the first line of defence, as they are located either extracellularly or in endosomal compartments, and thus are the first receptors to come into contact with invading microorganisms. TLRs are type-I integral membrane proteins characterised by a ligand binding, extracellular domain containing multiple leucine-rich repeat (LRR) regions, a transmembrane (TM) domain and a highly conserved Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain which transduces signals and induces expression of innate immune response genes (Uematsu and Akira, 2007) .",

In numerous cases vestigial TLRs are present as pseudogenes, such as TLR10 in mice (Hasan et al., 2005) and TLRs 11 and 12 in humans (Roach et al., 2005) . TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9 are located in endosomes, and are important for innate immune recognition of microbial nucleic acids (Xiao, 2009) . TLRs 3, 7, 8 recognise viral RNA, whereas TLR9 recognises viral, bacterial and protozoan DNA (Xiao, 2009; . TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are cell surface expressed and bind various protein, lipid and carbohydrate moieties in bacteria, protozoa and fungi Yarovinsky and Sher, 2006; Roeder et al., 2004) . TLRs 2 and 4 have also been demonstrated to bind viral proteins (Kurt-Jones et al., 2000; Bieback et al., 2002) . Ligands for TLRs 10, 12 and 13 have not been identified, however TLR13 (as well as TLRs 3, 7 and 9), has been shown to interact with Unc93B1, a molecule involved in transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomal compartments, thus indicating that it may be a virus-sensing TLR (Tabeta et al., 2006; Brinkmann et al., 2007) .",

Three TLR sequences from the fruit bat Rousettus leschenaultii were known prior to this study (Iha et al., 2010) ; however our report contains the first TLR sequences from a member of the genus Pteropus, and the first complete set of TLR sequences reported for any bat species to date.

Preliminary alignments of nucleotide sequence data from P. alecto and P. vampyrus confirmed that the two bats were very closely related at the genetic level, and suggested that TLRs 1 and 6 had approximately 1000 bp of nearly identical sequence at the 3 end. To resolve Fig. 1 . Predicted intron-exon organisation of pteropid bat TLRs 1-10 and TLR13. The intron-exon arrangements of pteropid bat TLRs were predicted by nucleotide alignment of P. alecto mRNA and P. vampyrus genomic DNA. Putative coding and non-coding sequences are drawn as light and dark rectangles respectively, while introns are indicated by dotted lines. P. alecto TLR13 is predicted to be a pseudogene due to the presence of three in-frame stop codons, as indicated by arrows. The figure is drawn to scale and distances are given in bp, however introns in TLRs 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 in the P. vampyrus genome assembly contained gaps so the actual sizes of these introns are estimates. The first exon of TLR5 was not represented in the P. vampyrus genome assembly and is therefore only assumed to be contiguous. Correspondingly, the first intron of TLR5 has been arbitrarily drawn at 1000 bp. In all other cases, intron-exon boundaries were clearly identified by homology in other species, and by the presence of splice site consensus sequences. In TLRs 7 and 9, the first coding exon contains only three coding nucleotides (ATG) that are hard to see in the diagram due to the scale. this, 3 RACE primers for these genes were positioned upstream of the homologous region, and for all of the TLRs, the entire coding region was amplified by PCR as a single large product for sequence confirmation. As a result, it was shown that P. vampyrus TLR1 and TLR6 genes were miss-assembled in Ensembl, where they are represented as a single gene rather than two loci. The P. vampyrus gene identified in Ensembl as TLR1 is a chimera consisting of \u223c1300 bp from the 5 end of TLR1 followed by \u223c1000 bp of TLR6. As predicted, the two genes have approximately 1000 bp of nearly identical sequence at the 3 end; however they diverge considerably in the final 160 bp of the coding region.",

In contrast, P. alecto TLR13 lacked a suitable start codon and contained three in-frame stop codons, suggestive of a recently inactivated pseudogene. Based on the confirmed P. alecto mRNA sequences, it was possible to reassemble genomic DNA sequences for P. vampyrus TLRs using shotgun sequence data available in the GenBank trace file archive, enabling a more accurate comparison of P. alecto mRNA with P. vampyrus genomic DNA. Alignments of P. alecto mRNA and P. vampyrus genomic DNA were performed for each gene, to determine the intron-exon organisation and splice sites of TLRs of the two pteropid bat species (Fig. 1) . Due to gaps in some of the introns within the P. vampyrus genome, some of the intron sizes had to be estimated, however in all cases splice site consensus sequences were used as the basis for assigning intron-exon junctions. TLRs 2, 6, 9 and 13 were each found to consist of two exons, while TLRs 1, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10 each consisted of three exons. TLR3 consisted of five exons. The coding regions of TLRs 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and 10 were each located within a single exon, while the coding regions of TLRs 7 and 9 were spread across two coding exons, the first of which contains just the first three nucleotides corresponding to the start codon. The coding region of TLR3 was spread out across four exons, while the coding region of TLR4 was spread across three exons. P. alecto TLR13 was transcribed, spliced and polyadenylated, despite the fact that it appears to be an inactivated pseudogene. In vivo transcription was demonstrated by the fact that it could be amplified from cDNA generated from DNAse-I treated P. alecto RNA. The identification of a large intron with GT-AG splice sites provided evidence of mRNA splicing, and a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) located a few bases upstream of a poly A+ tail provided evidence of polyadenylation (although the location of the poly A+ tail corresponded to a run of A's in the P. vampyrus genome, so it was unclear whether this was a genuine example of polyadenylation). In addition, the 5 end of exon 1 featured a 170 bp sequence widely represented in the P. vampyrus genome, and the intron contained a sequence resembling a LINE-1 transposable element. A frame-shift mutation relative to mouse TLR13 was also observed close to the 3 end of P. alecto TLR13, consisting of a 2 bp deletion that was present in both P. alecto and P. vampyrus.",

P. alecto and R. leschenaultii TLRs 3 and 7 clustered with other members of Laurasiatheria (horse, dog, cat). In contrast, P. alecto TLR8 was an outlier in the Laurasiatheria Table 2 for a list of accession numbers of protein sequences. group and P. alecto and R. leschenaultii TLR9 sequences did not cluster within Laurasiatheria at all. Laurasiatherian and primate TLR9 genes appeared to be more closely related to each other than they were to bat TLR9; however bat TLR9 was more similar to both of these groups than it was to rodent TLR9. P. alecto TLRs were also subjected to pair-wise analysis with human, bovine and mouse TLRs (Table 3 ).

In common with TLRs in other species, P. alecto TLRs feature signal peptides, LRR-rich ectodomains for ligand-binding, TM domains and cytoplasmic TIR domains for signal transduction. Structural modelling enabled the identification of more LRR domains in P. alecto TLRs than homology searching using SMART, and the highest accuracy of LRR domain prediction appeared to be for P. alecto TLR3, due to the availability of the human TLR3 ectodomain structure, combined with the fact that P. alecto TLR3 is highly conserved. The predicted intron-exon organisation of pteropid TLRs was found to be similar to that observed in other mammals, however varying numbers of 5 non-coding exons have been reported on occasion in some species. For example, bovine TLR1 is reported to have four non-coding 5 exons (Opsal et al., 2006) whereas only two were detected in P. alecto TLR1. The inability for automated gene assembly to detect many TLRs in the P. vampyrus genome, as well as significant miss-assemblies highlighted the need for laboratory confirmation of gene sequences mined from low-coverage genome assemblies. Overall however, TLRs in P. alecto were shown to be highly similar to TLRs in human and other mammalian species.",

Attempts to resolve the phylogenetic relationship of bats within this group in greater detail have produced varying results. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA placed bats within an existing subgroup of Laurasiatheria termed Fereuungulata (Carnivora + Perissodactyla + Cetartiodactyla) (Nikaido et al., 2000) , whereas analysis of LINE-1 retrotransposon insertions argued against the existence of Fereuungulata as a natural grouping and instead suggested the creation of a new group termed Pegasoferae (Chiroptera + Perissodactyla + Carnivora + Pholidota) (Nishihara et al., 2006) . Phylogenetic analysis of pteropid bat CD4, interferon-\u2423 and interferon-\u2424 genes showed that they clustered within Laurasiatheria and were most closely related to sequences from pig, horse, cat and dog (Omatsu et al., 2006 (Omatsu et al., , 2008 . The results of our phylogenetic analysis of P. alecto TLRs found that while bat TLRs 3 and 7 clustered with horse, cat and dog sequences, bat TLR8 was the least conserved sequence in Laurasiatheria, and bat TLR9 fell outside Laurasiatheria altogether. Despite this, the nucleic acidsensing TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9 can be considered highly conserved in bats, consistent with them being capable of viral recognition similar to other species.",

Ka/Ks ratios <1 are interpreted as evidence of negative (purifying) selection pressure, meaning that evolution is selecting against mutations in that gene. In contrast, Ka/Ks ratios >1 (which are encountered much less frequently) are interpreted as evidence of positive selection, whereby mutations are favoured over conservative replication. Viruses and other parasites are under constant positive selection pressure to mutate in order to escape the immune responses of their host, and correspondingly some vertebrate immune genes are also under positive selection pressure in order to keep up in a so-called \"molecular arms race\" (Nielsen et al., 2005) . Analysis of the Ka/Ks ratio of P. alecto TLRs with other mammals suggested weak negative selection, supporting the findings of previous studies and consistent with selection to conserve important binding specificities (Roach et al., 2005; Nakajima et al., 2008; Barreiro et al., 2009) .",

Analysis of P. alecto TLR5 using three predictive algorithms and three models of hydrophobicity predicted the presence of a second putative TM domain within the C terminal TIR domain. Structural modelling suggested that this region correlated with one of the parallel \u2424 sheets located in the core of the TIR domain, however the model was based on the structure of human TLR2 (the TLR5 TIR domain structure has not been solved). The presence of this hydrophobic sequence may affect TLR5 signal transduction, and may suggest a functional region worthy of closer examination. The TM domain of P. alecto TLR9 was unable to be predicted by TMHMM, which is surprising as this method is reported to have a very low false negative prediction rate (Krogh et al., 2001) , however using alternative methods we were able to identify a putative TM domain in P. alecto TLR9.",

Many questions remain about the functional significance of the TLR system in bats in relation to their role as carriers of zoonotic viruses. Unravelling the events that occur downstream of TLR signalling, such as induction of inflammatory cytokines and the potential for viruses to block TLR signalling pathways, depends firstly upon knowledge of which TLRs are present in the bat. It is hoped that this study fills that requirement and provides a prototype dataset that can be used to design functional assays. In summary, the fruit bat P. alecto appears to have a complement of TLRs resembling those present in humans and other mammals.
