ORF3 protein can be detected in PEDV-infected cells and it functions as an ion channel in both Xenopus laevis oocytes and yeast. Mutation analysis showed that Tyr170 in TM4 is important for potassium channel activity. Furthermore, viral production is reduced in infected Vero cells when ORF3 gene is silenced by siRNA.

Based on the similarity in the genome organization between SARS-CoV and PEDV, we predict that the ORF3 protein of PEDV may have a similar function as SARS-CoV 3a. Here, we adapted the methods used for SARS-CoV 3a (10) to generate a computational model of PEDV ORF3 protein. We detect its potassium ion channel activity using Xenopus laevis oocytes and a potassium uptake-deficient strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that virus production is reduced when using siRNA to knockdown ORF3 expression during PEDV infection. In vivo experiments also show that the existence of full length ORF3 is associated with pathogenesis. We thus demonstrate that the ORF3 protein of PEDV functions as an ion channel and enhances virus production. ",

The four helices were then assembled in a concerted fashion to form the monomer. Bundles formed by assembling in a concerted fashion from the monomers (Fig. 1B) (11) . A feature all bundles shared was helix 4 facing the pore. His-152 in TMD4 was located on an interhelical face. Tyrosines and phenylalanines appeared to be randomly distributed in all models. This finding was also observed in a side view of the bundle (Fig. 1C) . Notably, a line of four phenylalanines (Phe-49, -53, -56, -60) in TMD1 faced the lipid membrane (Fig. 1C) . Serines and threonines (helix 4) face the pore in bundle 1, whilst in bundle 3 threonines and lysines (helix 3) point towards the center (Fig. 1D) .

Both ORi and high potassium solutions were used as bath solutions. HA tagged PEDV ORF3 protein expression was revealed on oocyte cell membranes through confocal microscopy (Fig. 2B) . The TEVC data showed that when oocytes express PEDV CV777 ORF3, membrane current increased obviously compared to the oocytes injected with water (Fig. 2C) . Furthermore, in 100 mM potassium solution, oocytes expressing PEDV CV777 ORF3 show much larger currents than that in ORi (containing 90 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl) solution. These data suggest that PEDV ORF3 protein may be permeable to potassium ions. When a potassium channel inhibitor, BaCl 2 was applied, the ORF3 mediated current was inhibited (Fig. 2D) .

A potassium uptake-deficient strain of S. cerevisiae (W303, trk1D trk2D) can grow normally on media containing 100 mM K + , but it cannot grow on low potassium media (7 mM K + ). However, the growth of Dtrk1trk2 knockout yeast in low-K + medium can be rescued by exogenous potassium channel expression. Our data shows that all yeasts grew well on a medium with a high K + concentration. In contrast, yeast transformed with the pYES2 vector failed to grow on a low-K + medium, and yeast transformed with pYES2-ORF3 did (Fig. 2E) . These yeast K + uptake complementation results are consistent with the trace obtained using TEVC above. Therefore, it appears that the PEDV ORF3 coded protein forms an active plasma membrane potassium ion channel.",

It was interesting to observe that the ORF3 gene of an attenuated-type virus has 49 nucleotide deletions, leading to a reading frame-shift and TAG terminator at 274nt. Thus, attenuated PEDV ORF3 encodes a truncated protein of 91 amino acids that lacks the TM3 (116-139aa) and TM4 (151-172aa) domains, compared to the 224 amino acids of wild-type PEDV (Fig. 4A ). In the TEVC experiments, the current activity was determined in the ORF3 genes from attenuated and wild-type PEDV. The results showed that the mean steady-state current at \u00c0150 mV was \u00c0200 nA for truncated ORF3 coded by attenuated PEDV expressed in X. laevis oocytes in 100 mM potassium solution, while the wild-type PDEV ORF3 had a current of \u00c0800 nA (Fig. 4B) .

When ORF3 protein expression was knocked down by siRNA in the wildtype PEDV-infected Vero cells, the number of copies of viral genomic RNA in the cell culture supernatant was reduced with a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5D) . The virus genome copies were reduced 4-fold compared to the control siRNA (siNC) when the highest concentration of siRNA (50 nM) was used during PEDV infection. However, the intracellular virus RNA level had no significant change (Fig. 5C ). The number of infectious PEDV particles in culture supernatants determined by TCID 50 assay, and the wildtype PEDV showed a significantly decrease in infectious viral particles (Fig. 5F ).

Furthermore, as the model prediction, when the residue Tyr-170 in TM4 is mutated to Ala, the potassium ion channel activity was reduced in both yeast and oocytes systems.
