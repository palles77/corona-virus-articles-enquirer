As a result, Brazil and China put forward a joint declaration at the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Cooperation. This declaration called for a conference to look into the establishment of a global health agency; approval was unanimous. In 1946 a series of conferences were convened, leading to the incorporation, dissolution, or replacement by this new body of the four major regional health bodies: Office International d'Hygi\u00e8ne Publique (OIHP), United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), League of Nations Health Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The functions of the OIHP, UNRRA, and the League of Nations Health Organization were taken over by the WHO. The PAHO still stands as a separate international organization; its secretariat, the Pan American Sanitary Bureau (PASB), serves as the regional office of the WHO for the Americas. The name World Health Organization was suggested by Dr George B. Chisholm, who at the time was the Deputy Minister of National Health of Canada, and eventually became the first Director-General of the WHO (UN WHO interim commission 17) ( Table 1) .",

They have designated numerous institutes as collaborating centers involved in various projects. They also raise expert committees and advisory panels to ensure expertise in addressing the wide spectrum of issues that fall under its bailiwick. The annual World Health Reports have raised awareness of issues such as gaps in access to health care (1995), noncommunicable diseases (1997), health systems performance (2000), mental health (2001), and human resources for health (2006). They have offices or commissions focused on social determinants of health; child and adolescent health and development; macroeconomics and health; gender, women, and health; intellectual property rights, innovation, and public health; disability and rehabilitation; blood transfusion safety; and globalizaton of trade and health. Initiatives launched include 3 by 5, Civil Society Initiative, the Burden of Disease project, Global Campaign for Violence Prevention, and the International Medical Products Anti-Counterfeiting Task Force. The WHO uses high-profile individuals to raise awareness of significant health issues by designating them goodwill ambassadors on a yearly basis.

The WHO provides country-level support through its country offices in the form of policy recommendations and technical assistance in dealing with potential and existing public health threats. A recent example of the effectiveness of the WHO was seen in 2003 with the containment of a potential SARS outbreak and the tracking and containment of the spread of avian influenza.",

WHO activities cover a wider spectrum with programs like WHO-CHOosing Interventions that are Cost Effective (WHO-CHOICE). This program assists member states in setting priorities and identifying cost-effective interventions by assembling regional data on costs and health implications of interventions. Another example is the International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, which, while not an administrative register, aims to establish ethical standards for trials involving humans.

This includes not only conditions exclusive to the tropics, the true meaning of the term, but also conditions that have largely been controlled in first-world nations.

Thus, their focus is on the widespread implementation of these strategies. The fourth section, Innovative and Intensified Disease Management, is involved with conditions for which chemotherapeutic agents are available, but for which cost effective strategies have yet to be developed and implementation of strategies that do exist is minimal.
