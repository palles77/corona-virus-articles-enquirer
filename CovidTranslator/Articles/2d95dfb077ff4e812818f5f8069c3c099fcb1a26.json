In 1972, Berg and colleagues constructed the first recombinant DNA fragment, an SV40 hybrid DNA molecule ( Jackson et al., 1972) . In the following year, Cohen et al. (1973) combined two antibiotic resistance markers in a single plasmid and showed that when bacterial cells take up the recombined plasmid, they become resistant to both antibiotics. By then, a 77-nucleotide gene encoding a yeast alanine transfer RNA had been synthesized from 17 overlapping oligonucleotides (oligos) (Agarwal et al., 1970) . It was not long before it was announced that the human genes for somatostatin (Itakura et al., 1977) and insulin (Crea et al., 1978; Goeddel et al., 1979) were synthesized and inserted into a vector for expression in Escherichia coli.",

Restriction sites can be added to PCR primers to allow amplified products to be inserted into vector cloning sites. Overlapping DNA fragments can be assembled during PCR (Horton et al., 1990) using primers specific to the ends of the assembly; however, the size of the product cannot exceed the length that can be readily amplified by PCR. Complementary vector sequence is added to PCR primers in a technique known as ligationindependent cloning (LIC) (Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990 ). An improvement on this method was made and is known as sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC) (Li and Elledge, 2007) , which removes the sequence constraints of LIC. Both methods utilize exonuclease activity to expose complementary ssDNA sequences that can be specifically annealed. In these two systems, ligation of the DNA molecules is not performed in vitro but instead performed within a host organism following transformation of the annealed molecules.",

A two-step thermocycled in vitro recombination method was used to join 101 overlapping DNA cassettes into four quarter molecules of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome, each between 136 and 166 kb in size (Gibson et al., 2008) . Since then, two additional in vitro recombination methods were described that can join and clone DNA molecules larger than 300 kb, and can be carried out in a single step (Gibson et al., 2009) . The simplest approach is a one-step isothermal (ISO) reaction that can be used to join both ssDNA and dsDNA (Gibson et al., 2009 (Gibson et al., , 2010 . All three assembly systems utilize the three enzymes above to produce DNA molecules that are covalently joined, and polyethylene glycol (PEG), a macromolecular crowding agent, to stimulate recombination. Because the DNA products are covalently joined, PCR or rolling-circle amplification (RCA) can be performed directly from the reactions (Gibson et al., 2009 (Gibson et al., , 2010 .",

We found that all components of this assembly system can be premixed and kept frozen until needed. Thus, all that is required for DNA assembly is for input ssDNA or dsDNA to be added to this mixture, and the mixture to be briefly incubated at 50 C. These approaches could be very useful for cloning multiple inserts into a vector without relying on the availability of restriction sites and for rapidly constructing large DNA molecules. For example, regions of DNA too large to be amplified by a single PCR event can be divided into multiple overlapping PCR amplicons and then assembled into one piece. The ISO system is advantageous for assembling circular products, which accumulate because they are not substrates for any of the three enzymes. The one-step thermocycled method, however, can be used to generate linear assemblies because the exonuclease is inactivated during the reaction. Protocols for these recombination methods are provided later.",

DNA molecules can also be assembled from overlapping restriction fragments. The noncomplementary partial restriction sites will be removed during recombination and form a contiguous piece of DNA without intervening sequence. DNA fragments are often assembled with a vector to form a circular product. PCR amplification can be used to produce a unique vector containing terminal overlaps to the ends of the DNA fragments being joined. To produce these cloning vectors, each PCR primer includes an overlap with one end of the vector, a restriction site (e.g., NotI) not present within the insert to allow its release from the vector, and an overlap with one end of the DNA fragment assembly.

The T4 pol is then inactivated by incubation at 75 C, followed by slow cooling to anneal the complementary overlap regions. In the second step, the annealed joints are repaired using Taq pol and Taq lig at 45 C in the presence of all four dNTPs. Taq pol is generally used as the gapfilling enzyme in this system because it does not strand-displace, which would lead to disassembly of the joined DNA fragments. It also has inherent 5 0exonuclease activity (or nick translation activity) (Chien et al., 1976) , which eliminates the need to phosphorylate the input DNA (a requirement for DNA ligation). This is because 5 0 -phosphorylated ends are created following nick translation. Further, this activity removes any noncomplementary sequences (e.g., partial restriction sites at the ends of overlapping restriction fragments), which would otherwise end up in the final joined product. Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mM MgCl 2 , and 4 mM DTT and can be aliquoted and stored at \u00c020 C for several years. 2. The DNA fragments to be assembled are mixed in a volume not exceeding 10 ml. Approximately 10-100 ng of each DNA segment is used in equimolar amounts. For 5-8 kb DNA fragments, 25 ng substrate DNA is ideal. For larger assemblies, the amount of DNA is increased accordingly (e.g., for 20-32 kb DNA fragments, 100 ng DNA substrate is used). It is best to use 1 kb DNA fragments in 5-to 10-fold excess. 3. In a 0.2-ml PCR tube on ice, a 20-ml reaction is prepared and consists of 5 ml 4\u00c2 CBA reaction buffer, 0.2 ml of 10 mg/ml BSA (NEB), 0.4 ml of 3 U/ml T4 pol (NEB), and the DNA prepared in step 2. 4. The tube is added to a thermocycler and cycled as follows: 37 C for 5 ( 80-bp overlaps) or 15 min (!80-bp overlaps), 75 C for 20 min, 0.1 C/s to 60 C, 60 C for 30 min, and then 0.1 C/s to 4 C. 5. Taq repair buffer (TRB) is prepared. This buffer consists of 5.83% PEG-8000, 11.7 mM MgCl 2 , 15.1 mM DTT, 311 mM each of the four dNTPs, and 1.55 mM b-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and can be aliquoted and stored at \u00c020 C for up to 1 year. 6. Ten microliters of the CBA reaction, following step 4, is added to 25.75 ml of TRB in a tube on ice. In all, 4 ml of 40 U/ml Taq lig (NEB) and 0.25 ml of 5 U/ml Taq pol (NEB) are then added. 7. The reaction is incubated at 45 C for 15 min. 8. Samples may be used in downstream applications such as PCR or transformed into E. coli. For transformation, 3 ml of the undiluted TRB reaction can be directly electroporated into 30 ml Epi300 cells (Epicentre) in a 1-mm cuvette (BioRad) at 1200 V, 25 mF, and 200 O using a Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporation System (BioRad). Cells are allowed to recover in 1 ml Super Optimal broth with Catabolite repression (SOC) medium and then plated onto LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic. 9. Assembly reactions are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for product formation.",

This is because dNTPs are required at a later point to fill in the gapped DNA molecules. ExoIII, which removes nucleotides from the 3 0 -ends of dsDNA, is fully functional even in the presence of dNTPs, so it is a candidate for a one-step reaction. However, it will compete with polymerase for binding to the 3 0 -ends. To eliminate this competition, and allow for one-step DNA assembly, antibody-bound Taq pol (Ab-Taq pol) is used in combination with ExoIII ( Fig. 15.3) . In this assembly method, overlapping DNA fragments and all components necessary to covalently join the DNA molecules (i.e., ExoIII, Ab-Taq pol, dNTPs, Taq lig, etc.) are added in a single tube and placed in a thermocycler (Gibson et al., 2009) . At 37 C, ExoIII is active (but Ab-Taq pol remains inactive) and recesses the 3 0 -ends of the dsDNA molecules. The reaction is then shifted to 75 C, which inactivates ExoIII. Annealing of the DNA molecules commences and the antibody dissociates from Taq pol, thus activating this enzyme. Further annealing, extension, and ligation are then carried out at 60 C.",
