The model reproduces all clinical signs of measles, but the lack of ferret-specific reagents has limited the characterization of the cellular immune response. Towards this, we cloned ferret cytokines and established semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays. To demonstrate the utility of these assays we compared the cytokine profiles elicited by lethal and non-lethal strains during the prodromal phase. We observed a general lack of cytokine induction in animals that later succumbed to the disease, whereas survivors mounted a robust and sustained response. The newly developed cytokine assays strengthen and expand the ferret model not only for Morbillivirus pathogenesis studies but also for several other human respiratory viruses including influenza and SARS.",

Ferrets are naturally susceptible to several human respiratory pathogens and a number of gastro-intestinal bacterial diseases (Ball, 2006) . They have long been recognized as a model for the efficacy assessment of new vaccines or treatment approaches against influenza and more recently severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and they are also used to study prion diseases (Bartz et al., 1998; Maher and DeStefano, 2004; Ter Meulen et al., 2006) . The purpose of the present study was to establish mRNAbased cytokine assays for ferrets and to validate this new tool by comparing the early host response to lethal and non-lethal CDV infections. Towards this, we completed the sequences of ferret cytokines representing the different axes of the cellular immune response and developed semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays. We then evaluated cytokine mRNA expression levels at 3 and 7 days after inoculation and found that survival was associated with a robust and sustained response whereas animals that succumbed to the disease experienced a generalized shutoff of cytokine expression.",

As mustelids, ferrets are most closely related to other carnivores like dogs and cats (McKenna and Bell, 1997) . The first set of primers was therefore based on canine and feline sequences available in GenBank. We initially obtained small fragments of ferret IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL2, IL4, IL6, and TNF\u03b1 and used those sequences to measure cytokine mRNA induction using a gel-based assay . To develop a robust and versatile realtime PCR-based assay that generates a representative cytokine profile, we included IL10 and IL12p40 and pursued the sequencing of larger parts of the open reading frames. This strategy has so far yielded complete open reading frames for IL2, IL4, IL6, IFN\u03b1 (consensus sequence), and TNF\u03b1 (GenBank accession nos. IL2 EF368206; IL4 EF368210; IL6 EF368209; IFN\u03b1 EF368207; TNF\u03b1 EF368211) and partial gene sequences for IL10 and IFN\u03b3 (> 95) and IL12p40 (\u223c 60%; GenBank accession nos. IL10 EF368212; IFN\u03b3 EF368214; IL12p40 EF368213). When comparing the ferret cytokines with the respective canine and feline proteins, we observed a slightly higher overall amino acid identity between ferrets and dogs than between ferrets and cats (Table 1) . This degree of similarity on the amino acid and nucleotide level (data not shown) confirms the identity of the obtained sequences.",

Samples included in the lethal group originated from animals infected with either 5804P-eGFP/H (von Messling et al., 2004) or A75eH (Rudd et al., 2006) , whereas the survivor group consisted of individuals inoculated with the highly pathogenic but non-lethal strain 5804P-eGFP/uN (von Messling et al., 2004) or survivors of 5804P/A75eH chimeric viruses. These viruses, in which the envelope glycoproteins were exchanged between the two lethal strains, cause severe disease but only 60-80% mortality (unpublished results). In the case of 5804P-eGFP/uN, which carries an eGFPcontaining additional transcription unit upstream of the N gene, the non-lethal phenotype is due to a slight delay in replication efficacy, whereas minimal incompatibilities between viral proteins originating from different strains are the likely cause of survival in the case of the 5804P/A75 chimeric viruses.",

To better understand the basis for host immune response control in our ferret model, we established semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays based on ferret cytokine sequences and compared the response associated with lethal disease outcome or survival. We found that animals succumbing to the disease failed to mount a sustained response, while survivors showed initially a Th1 polarization that later transitioned into a Th2-biased response.",

The results represent thus the profile at the late stages of the acute disease phase or at the onset of neurologic disease after recovery from the acute infection. Interestingly, animals with severe signs of disease and viremia at the time of death displayed low or absent cytokine mRNA induction in blood-derived RNA, consistent with our initial findings in 5804P-infected ferrets and this study (Grone et al., 1998; von Messling et al., 2006) . In contrast, individuals with mild or absent general signs of disease but neurologic manifestations mounted a broad response not only in the blood but also locally in the CNS (Grone et al., 1998; Markus et al., 2002) . The role of the systemic and local immune response in the context of this delayed neurologic form of CDV remains to be investigated in ferrets. Each samples was analyzed in triplicates and only samples where the variation among triplicates was less than 10% were included in the analysis, resulting in the variability in numbers of individuals plotted for the different cytokines. The black bar represents the mean of all the samples. The hatched zone represents threshold levels of 1.5 fold expression change, which is considered normal variability.",

In vitro, it has been demonstrated that minute amounts of MV envelope are suffice to induce an anergic state in exposed lymphocytes, but the exact interactions remain to be elucidated (Schlender et al., 1996) . In addition, the non-essential protein V has been shown to inhibit activation of an anti-viral response by interfering with nuclear localization of STATs (Devaux et al., in press; Palosaari et al., 2003) . It is possible that the shutdown of cytokine expression observed for the lethal CDV strains results from contacts between viral glycoproteins and immune cells in combination with a V and phosphoprotein-dependent inhibition of the induction of the anti-viral state in infected cells. Taken together our findings demonstrate that the disease outcome is decided within the first days of infection.",

By comparing samples from animals with different disease outcome, we have demonstrated that our semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays are sufficiently sensitive to detect a very weak response and even a reduction from baseline levels as observed in animals that later succumbed to the disease. At the same time, the assays allow the quantification of the response across a much wider range than the previous gel-based approach . This will enable the more detailed comparison of the cytokine responses to specifically attenuated viruses in future studies. Furthermore, this RNA-based assay can easily be applied to various tissues as well as bodily fluids, enabling the assessment of the local and systemic responses at the same time. It thus adds a versatile new tool to the study of hostpathogen interactions in this model.",

Primer pairs for the initial amplification of ferret cytokines were based on conserved regions in the respective genes of the phylogenetically related carnivores, dogs and cats, available in GenBank (canine sequences: IL2 AM238655; IL4 NM001003159; IL6 NM001003301; IL10 NM001003077; IL12p40 U49100; IFN\u03b1 A33693; IFN\u03b3 NM001003174; TNF\u03b1 Z70046; feline sequences: IL2 NM001043337; IL4 NM001043339; IL6 NM001009211; IL10 NM001009209; IL12p40 Y07762; IFN\u03b1 DQ220469; IFN\u03b3 X86974; TNF\u03b1 NM001009835).

The real-time PCR was performed in a RG-3000A (Rotor-Gene), using the following protocol: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s, 60\u00b0C for 15 s, and 72\u00b0C for 25 s, and a melting curve analysis to confirm reaction specificity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and only values that varied less than 10% were considered. The fold change ratios between experimental and control samples for each gene were calculated with GAPDH levels as a reference. Towards this the cycle at which GAPDH crosses the detection threshold (Ct) is subtracted from the Ct value of the gene of interest at each time point (\u0394Ct). The fold change is then calculated by subtracting the \u0394Ct values of the respective gene at day 0 from those obtained at subsequent days (\u0394\u0394Ct). To transform these values into absolute values, the formula: fold change = 2 \u2212 \u0394\u0394Ct is used (Schmittgen et al., 2000) .",
