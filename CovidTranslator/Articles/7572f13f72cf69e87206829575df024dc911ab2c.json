In the three suspected cases, Ebola infection was ruled out, and the patients were rapidly diagnosed with malaria.",

Social media ranked third and mass media, fourth, and both may have played a more important role, as described in the literature, 13e16 for those HCWs who had worked in the institute for less than 2 years. The study performed by Olowookere et al. revealed radio (37.2%) and the internet (28.4%) as frequent sources of information on Ebola for HCWs in Nigeria, 10 similar to the data seen in our study, where 33.1% of respondents cited the internet and 30.6% cited mass media as sources of information. This relatively low use of mass media in HCWs for information purposes (lower than the rate of 53.1% use of television and 45.5% use of internet for retrieving information on Ebola by the general population in Germany 7 ) is probably due to the fact that most of our HCWs (81.5%) had already received pertinent information at the time of our survey from their employer, the Matei Bal\u0219 Institute. An encouraging finding was that those who had received various trainings on Ebola disease in the institute during the 2014 outbreak were 1.2e1.3 times more likely to correctly identify transmission routes 2 years later during our survey in 2016. Another important aspect is that respondents who did not correctly p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 6 4 ( 2 0 1 8 ) 7 e1 5 identify Ebola or its transmission routes in our survey selfreported 1.8 times more frequently that they felt the need for more information on prevention methods, suggesting that when there is a gap in knowledge, this is self-acknowledged and can thus be remedied promptly.",

However, our study does provide robust data in terms of Ebola preparedness and risk perception, and the fact that it has been applied after the end of the outbreak offers the unique advantage of providing reliable data, outside of the window of maximum emotional involvement. Therefore, the information can better be generalised and can also serve as a baseline evaluation for further panel surveys to assess the impact of interventions and trainings to be deployed in Romania in the following years.",

Other limitations include the fact that the questionnaire was selfadministered, and importantly, the fact that our study's results are not generalisable to HCWs all over Romania as the survey was conducted in a tertiary university hospital from the country's capital, a referral facility for public health emergencies, including Ebola. Therefore, the medical personnel from this institute may have had easier access to specific information and training than other HCWs outside the country's capital or from non-tertiary infectious diseases hospitals.",
