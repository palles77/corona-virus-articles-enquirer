The potential for serotype-cross-reactive antibodies to exacerbate disease during a secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype has driven efforts to study human DENV-specific antibodies. Most DENV-specific antibodies generated in humans are serotype-cross-reactive, weakly neutralizing, and directed against the immature pre-membrane (prM), envelope (E), and nonstructural 1 (NS1) proteins. To broaden the characterization of human DENV-specific antibodies, we assessed B-cell responses by ELISpot assays and isolated B cells from the peripheral blood of a human subject with previous DENV infection. Forty-eight human IgG monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) were initially characterized by their potential to bind to an inactivated lysate of DENVinfected cells. Subsequently, most DENV-specific hMAbs were found to bind soluble, recombinant E protein (rE). Two hMAbs were unable to bind rE, despite strongly binding to the DENV-infected cell lysate. Further analyses showed that these two hMAbs bound conformation-dependent, reduction-sensitive epitopes on E protein. These data shed light on the breadth of DENV-specific hMAbs generated within a single immune donor.",

Serotype-specific epitopes elicit murine antibodies with the strongest neutralizing activities, and protection in animals by antibodies correlates with neutralizing activity in vitro. Based on epitope-mapping studies, many DENV serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies were localized to domain III (DIII) of the E protein, whereas neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that cross-reacted with other flaviviruses localized primarily to domain II (DII), near the fusion sequence (23, 30, 33) .",

In the last couple years, several groups have generated and characterized human (h)MAbs by stimulating memory B cells obtained from DENV-immune donors in vitro (1, 6, 8, 29, 32) . Antibodies specific for the E protein with poor, moderate, or potent neutralizing activity, and antibodies specific for the prM protein that were poorly neutralizing but highly crossreactive, have been isolated. In contrast to the findings in mice, antibodies against DIII are a minority in human immune sera and among isolated hMAbs (1, 8, 29) . B-cell ELISpot assays represent an alternative approach to analyze the human B-cell response to DENV. We recently reported on the use of ELISpot assays to compare responses to homologous and heterologous DENV serotypes in primary and secondary DENV infections (19) . ELISpot assays allow more accurate quantitation of cell frequencies than isolation of MAbs, but definition of serotype cross-reactivity at the clonal level is more difficult.",

B-cell bulk cultures were counted, and \u00a3 2.5 \u00b7 10 4 cells in 100 lL were added to each well in duplicate. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. After washing, 100 lL biotinylated MAb directed against human IgG (1 lg/mL in PBS/0.5% FBS; MT78/145; Mabtech) was added. The plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, washed, and developed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin (100 lL of 1:1000 dilution in PBS/0.5% FBS; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The plates were analyzed using a CTL ImmunoSpot reader (CTL, Shaker Heights, OH).",

For standard assays, 384-well microplates were coated overnight with 20 ng/well DENV-1-4 E or DENV-2 NS1 protein (Hawaii Biotech), a 1:40 dilution of DENV-1-4-infected or uninfected (control) Vero cell lysate, or infectious or immature DENV virions. The recombinant proteins were expressed in Drosophila sp. S2 cells, which are known to bind to native conformation-dependent MAbs (20) . Furthermore, x-ray crystallography studies have demonstrated that these proteins retain a native-like structure (3). The DENV-1-4 antigens were prepared from infected Vero cell monolayers, as previously described (24) . Briefly, Vero cell monolayers were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0 plaque-forming units (PFU)/cell, and incubated at 37\u00b0C in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-9-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2% FBS (Gibco), until 50% of the cells displayed cytopathology. Cells were then harvested, washed, fixed in 0.025% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min on ice, washed again, and resuspended in RPMI 1640. The suspension of fixed cells was then sonicated on ice in a sonic dismembrator (Fisher Chemical, Loughborough, U.K.) and centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was collected, aliquotted, and frozen at -80\u00b0C as viral antigen. Control antigen was prepared similarly from uninfected Vero cell monolayers. Immature DENV particles were produced in human adenocarcinoma LoVo cells (ATCC CCL-229), as described previously (26) . Briefly, LoVo cells were infected with DENV in serum-free Ham's F12K medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) at an MOI of 1. The virus inoculum was removed after 1.5 h, and fresh medium was added after washing the cells twice with PBS. After 7 d, the medium containing the virus particles was harvested, cleared of cellular debris by low-speed centrifugation, aliquotted, and stored at -80\u00b0C. Transformed B-cell cultures were also screened for antibody production using a modified ELISA (25, 29) . For the modified assay, 96-well plates were coated with concanavalin A (ConA; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 25 lg/mL in 0.01 M HEPES (Gibco) in a total volume of 100 lL/well for 1 h. The wells were washed, and 50 lL serum-free DENV preparations were added for 18 h. Undiluted supernatant containing murine MAb 3H5 (from ATCC HB-46), which binds to DENV-2 E, was used as a positive control during the screening process. Negative controls consisted of culture fluid grown in parallel with no virus. The plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 90 min, and dilutions of antibodies #27 and #41 were added to the wells for 1 h. The plates were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Goat anti-human IgG coupled to HRP (A80-104P; Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX) was added as the secondary antibody at a 1:20,000 dilution. Then, 100 lL TMB (3,3\u00a2,5,5\u00a2-tetramethylbenzidine) peroxidase substrate (50-76-00; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added as the substrate. After approximately 20 min, the enzyme reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M hydrochloric acid, and the plates were read at 450 nm.",

PBMCs were cultured in the presence of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist R848 for 7 d to activate memory B cells to secrete antibody. We used recombinant (r) E and NS1 proteins to identify DENV-specific ASCs. We detected DENV E-specific ASCs in PBMCs from 5/5 donors, and NS1specific ASCs in 4/5 donors (Fig. 1A) . We next used supernatants from R848-stimulated PBMCs to assess whether the breadth and serotype cross-reactivity of antibodies to DENV proteins detected by ELISpot were also reflected in the antibodies secreted by memory B cells. We detected secretion of E-specific antibodies by 4/4 donors (one donor was not tested), and NS1-specific antibodies by 2/4 donors (Fig. 1B) .

Since the inactivated cell lysates contain multiple structural and nonstructural proteins of DENV, we next tested the supernatants for recognition of DENV rE and rNS1 proteins, the major targets of anti-DENV antibodies. We found that 17/40 wells recognized rE protein, and 3/40 supernatants recognized DENV-2 rNS1 protein; 20/40 supernatants did not recognize either rE or rNS1 (Fig. 3A) . Of the 17 antibodies that recognized the rE protein, 6 (36%) were serotype-specific with responses predominantly to DENV-3 E, and 11 (64%) were cross-reactive and recognized more than one serotype of E ( Fig. 3B and C) . The relative concentrations of specific viral components in the cell lysates are unknown, which could explain the qualitative differences in antibody recognition of DENVinactivated lysates and recombinant proteins. Since B cells were seeded at 100 cells/well, we also cannot exclude the possibility that a change in relative concentration of polyclonal Abs present within the same well over time may have impacted these results. However, given the low frequency of memory B cells in PBMCs, we believe this was unlikely.

The B cell lines that secreted MAbs #27 and #41 both expressed CD19 and CD20 (Fig. 7) , but did not express CD27, a marker associated with memory B cells. Plasma cells differentiate from activated memory B cells, and this differentiation is linked to proliferation induced either by antigen binding or by triggering of CD40 or TLRs (17, 24, 35) . Our findings indicated that #27 and #41 expressed activation markers (CD38), and markers associated with plasma cells (CD138). In addition, these cell lines expressed high levels of intracellular IgG, but little cell-surface IgG. Together, these data suggest that B cells from donor 2 that maintained their ability to secrete DENV-specific antibodies were CD19 + CD20 + CD27 -CD38 + CD138 + IgG + B cells. ",

We characterized in detail two antibodies that did not bind rE protein produced in Drosophila cells, but bound reduction-sensitive epitopes on the E protein derived from whole virus or virus-infected cell lysates. As the rE protein used in these studies contained only *80% of the full-length protein, lacking the membrane-proximal region and the transmembrane domains, it is possible that MAbs #27 and #41 target these regions (3) . It is also possible that these antibodies bind epitopes that are poorly accessible on the surface of the mature virion, are cryptic, or are formed by multiple E proteins in close proximity.

Our data indicated that there was a weak and inconsistent correlation between DENVspecific antibody titers in the serum and the frequency of DENV-specific memory B cells in the blood. We do not know if our results with hMAbs correlate with the neutralization properties of polyclonal immune serum from this donor. The abundance of non-neutralizing and weakly neutralizing hMAbs generated from DENV-specific memory B cells suggests that only a small fraction of DENV-specific antibodies in immune sera are responsible for the majority of in vitro neutralization (1, 6, 8) . However, individual antibodies that are weakly neutralizing may function differently in a polyclonal milieu (2) . On the other hand, these antibodies may actually serve to enhance viral replication of FcR-expressing cells, as has been shown by several groups (1, 8) . The humoral immune system has many mechanisms that contribute to viral control. Antibodies may redirect virus into noninfective environments or trigger immune complexes or lysis by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), or by local cytokine secretion (9, 21) . Further studies are needed to understand how the properties of hMAbs from DENVimmune donors relate to the properties of serum antibody.",

Alternate approaches whereby immunoglobulin genes are molecularly cloned result in stable antibody production by promising B-cell lines and should be considered (41) .",

We were able to see a distinct but small population of CD27 + cells in PBMCs from donor 2; however, we found low expression on bulk B cells and in lines #27 and #41. The finding that these ASCs do not express CD27, a marker used to phenotype memory B cells, was unexpected. While CD27 expression was initially used as an exclusive marker of memory B cells, recent reports suggest that CD27 expression is more diverse than previously appreciated (17) . CD27 expression has been reported to be downregulated following EBV transformation (22) ; therefore, it is possible that memory B cells secreting MAbs #27 and #41 downregulated CD27. TLR9 stimulation of naive (CD27 -) and memory (CD27 + ) human B cells in vitro converts them to CD138 + cells, a marker used for bone marrow-resident plasma cells (15, 16) . Whether markers on DENV-specific ASCs are re-flective of atypical memory B cells that exist in vivo, or whether the in vitro conditions used to stimulate human B cells altered their phenotype, is unclear. We only characterized hMAbs from a single donor in this study. The difficulty of obtaining samples from immune donors with a well-characterized natural history of DENV infection is well known. Nevertheless, our data support recent findings in the literature that anti-DENV hMAbs are cross-reactive and directed against multiple proteins (1, 6, 8, 29, 32) . Further studies in larger cohorts of donors are required to draw more generalizable conclusions about the repertoire of B cells available in the peripheral blood of DENV-immune donors.",
