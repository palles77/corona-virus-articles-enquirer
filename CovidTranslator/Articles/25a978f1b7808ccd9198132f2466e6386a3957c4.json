As described in Chapter 3, \"Features of Host Cells: Cellular and Molecular Biology Review,\" the plasma membrane of the cell is composed of a phospholipid bilayer that has numerous proteins protruding from the membrane. These surface proteins have a variety of functions that include transporting ions and molecules, facilitating the binding of one cell to another, or acting as receptors for incoming proteins. The majority of plasma membrane proteins are glycosylated, meaning that they have been modified with sugars and carbohydrates. To infect a cell, it is critical that a virus initiates attachment-the binding of the virus to the host cell. This interaction is specific: the virus contains a virus attachment protein that adsorbs to a cell surface receptor on the cell (Table 4 .1). The target receptor molecules on the cell surface are normal molecules required for cellular functions that viruses have evolved to exploit, usually glycoproteins or the sugar/carbohydrate residues present on glycoproteins or the plasma membrane. For instance, rhinovirus binds a protein known as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), involved in the attachment of one cell to another. Influenza A virus strains bind to the sialic acid sugars found at the ends of cellular carbohydrate chains, and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) reversibly bind to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparan sulfate, in order to bind to the herpesvirus entry mediator protein or nectins on the cell surface ( Fig. 4.1) .",

            "text": "Some viruses also require coreceptors to infect cells. HIV initially binds to a protein known as CD4 on the surface of T lymphocytes (\"T cells\") but requires one of two coreceptor proteins to continue the process of infection. As will be described later in Chapter 11, \"Human Immunodeficiency Virus,\" humans that have a modified version of CCR5, one of these coreceptors, are largely resistant to infection with HIV because the virus cannot use the modified CCR5 as a coreceptor and so infection is blocked. Infection of a cell can be prevented if attachment of the virus can be inhibited, and virus attachment proteins are the target of many antiviral drugs in use and in development. Attachment involves opposing electrostatic forces on the virus attachment protein and the cell surface receptor. The virus attachment protein is located in the outermost portion of the virus, since this is where contact with the cell occurs. The attachment protein protrudes from the envelope of an enveloped virus, whereas nonenveloped viruses have one or more capsid proteins that interact with the cell surface receptor. The viral attachment proteins can extend from the surface of the virion or can be within \"canyons\" formed by capsid proteins. For example, 90% of human rhinovirus serotypes bind to ICAM-1 on the surface of cells. Instead of binding to the outside of the rhinovirus capsid, the molecule docks into a deep canyon formed by the rhinovirus VP1, VP2, and VP3 proteins (Fig. 4.2A) . In contrast, 10% of human rhinoviruses attach to the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor. This interaction does not occur in canyons formed by the viral proteins, however. Instead, several VP1 proteins at the vertices of the icosahedral capsid bind to the receptor (Fig. 4.2B) . Even if the binding affinity between the VP1 protein and the VLDL receptor is low, the multiple VP1 proteins increase the total binding strength of the interaction. This example also illustrates that different strains of the same virus can take advantage of different cell surface receptors for attachment.",

As described in Chapter 3, \"Features of Host Cells: Cellular and Molecular Biology Review,\" cells are able to import molecules through the process of endocytosis. Receptormediated endocytosis occurs when receptors on the cell surface are bound by their ligands and internalized in clathrin-coated pits or caveolae that become endocytic vesicles. Eventually, these vesicles lose their clathrin or caveolin coating and fuse with \"early endosomes,\" slightly acidic vesicles (pH of 6.0-6.5) that become \"late endosomes\" as their acidity increases (pH of 5.0-6.0). Late endosomes deliver materials to lysosomes, larger vesicles full of digestive enzymes. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is commonly used by viruses to penetrate the plasma membrane. As the pH of the endosome drops, the viral proteins change configuration, which allows them to escape from the endosome. Depending upon the virus, this can happen in early endosomes, late endosomes, or lysosomes. Both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses take advantage of receptor-mediated endocytosis to gain entry into the cytoplasm of the cell (Fig. 4.4) . Most types of viruses use clathrin-mediated endocytosis to enter the cell, including dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, and reoviruses. A few well-known viruses that infect humans, such as SV40 and papillomaviruses (that cause warts or cervical cancer), use caveolae-mediated endocytosis; this was discovered by using a drug that inhibited the formation of caveolae. Blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis did not prevent the entry of these viruses into cells. Still other viruses undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis that is independent of both clathrin and caveolin.",

The tropism of a virus refers to the specificity of a virus for a particular host cell or tissue. Viruses will only be able to infect the cells that display the molecules to which their virus attachment proteins bind. Similarly, one reason that certain viruses have a narrow host range is because different host species may lack the cell surface proteins that a particular virus uses for attachment. For instance, humans are the only known natural hosts of poliovirus. Because of this, poliovirus has historically been a difficult virus to study because the cell surface receptor it uses for attachment, called CD155 or the poliovirus receptor, is not present in small animal models, such as mice. In 1990, a transgenic mouse strain was engineered to express the human CD155 molecule. These mice were susceptible to infection, whereas the normal nontransgenic mice were not ( Fig. 4 .3).",

With the exception of poxviruses, the genome replication of all dsDNA viruses takes place within the nucleus of the infected cell. Eukaryotic DNA replication, also reviewed in more detail in Chapter 3, \"Features of Host Cells: Cellular and Molecular Biology Review,\" is also carried out by DNA polymerases and other proteins within the nucleus. DNA polymerases, whether they are cell derived or virus derived, cannot carry out de novo synthesis, however. They must bind to a short primer of nucleic acid that has bound to the single-stranded piece of DNA, forming a short double-stranded portion that is then extended by DNA polymerase (Fig. 4 .8A). Primase is the enzyme that creates primers during cellular DNA replication, and some viruses, such as polyomaviruses and some herpesviruses, take advantage of the cellular primase enzyme to create primers on their dsDNA genomes during replication. Other herpesviruses, such as HSV-1, provide their own primase molecule, although this process occurs less commonly. Still other viruses, such as the adenoviruses, encode a viral protein primer that primes its own viral DNA polymerase ( Fig. 4 .8B). Cellular DNA polymerases are used by polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses, while all other dsDNA viruses encode their own DNA polymerases to replicate the viral genome. Many other cellular enzymes and proteins are required for DNA synthesis, and viruses are dependent on these to varying degrees, depending upon the specific virus. The poxviruses are a notable exception to this: they encode all the proteins necessary for DNA replication. In fact, they also encode the proteins needed for transcription of RNA, and so, unlike all other dsDNA viruses, they do not need to gain entry into the nucleus of a host cell for either genome replication or transcription and processing of viral genes, allowing their replication to take place entirely in the cytoplasm.",

These viruses are some of the smallest known viruses, with nonenveloped icosahedral capsids of 18-30 nm in diameter, and correspondingly small genomes of 4000-6000 nucleotides. Because they encode only a few genes, they are completely dependent on host cell enzymes for genome replication and transcription. During replication, the ssDNA genome enters the nucleus of the host cell, where the ssDNA is converted to dsDNA by DNA polymerase during S phase of the cell cycle. This occurs because the ssDNA genome of parvoviruses has \"hairpin\" ends that fold back and complementarily bind to the ssDNA (Fig. 4.8C ). This process, known as self-priming, creates a primer for DNA polymerase to extend. After the ssDNA genome becomes double-stranded, RNA polymerase II is able to transcribe the viral genes, which are then translated into viral proteins, and DNA polymerase replicates the genome so assembly of nascent virions can occur. DNA polymerases cannot carry out de novo synthesis and so need a primer in order to replicate DNA. Some viruses take advantage of the cellular primase in order to create primers (A), while other viruses, such as adenoviruses, encode a protein primer that primes its own DNA polymerase (B). In the process of self-priming, the ssDNA genomes of parvoviruses fold back upon themselves to form hairpin ends that act as a primer for host DNA polymerase (C). the virion looks like a wheel (rota means \"wheel\" in Latin; Fig. 4 .9). Rotavirus has 11 genome segments and is the major cause of childhood diarrhea. Picobirnaviruses are another family of dsRNA viruses that infect humans, but they are bisegmented, only having two genome segments that together are around 4.2 kb in length (the name of the viral family means \"small two-RNA viruses,\" referring to the two dsRNA genome segments). Human picobirnaviruses have been isolated from diarrhea, although the association of the virus as a cause of a specific disease is currently unclear.",

However, the HA protein must be cleaved into two portions, HA 1 and HA 2 , to become infectious, because although the HA 1 portion binds the cell surface receptor, the HA 2 portion is what fuses the viral envelope to the endosomal membrane to release the virus into the cytoplasm. This cleavage of HA into HA 1 and HA 2 is carried out by cell proteases (enzymes that cleave proteins). In contrast, the HIV core particle is composed of proteins encoded by the gag gene. The gene is translated into a polyprotein that is cleaved by the viral protease to form the capsid, matrix, and nucleocapsid proteins of the virion. In this case, maturation occurs after the virion has been released from the cell surface (Fig. 4.17) and is required to form an infectious virion. Discussed in (A) HIV proteins congregate at the plasma membrane of the cell, causing a bud to form in the membrane. The diploid RNA genome is packaged into the assembling capsid (B). The virus is released from the cell membrane, but the Gag polyprotein has not yet been cleaved to separate the capsid and matrix proteins of the virion (C). The HIV protease cleaves the polyprotein, allowing the proteins to complete the infectious virion architecture (D). Chapter 8, \"Vaccines, Antivirals, and the Beneficial Uses of Viruses,\" several anti-HIV drugs work by inhibiting the action of the HIV protease, thereby preventing the cleavage of the polyprotein and subsequent formation of an infectious virion.",

            "text": "l Penetration is the method by which viruses cross the plasma membrane of the cell. l Viruses take advantage of normal cellular processes to gain entry into the cytoplasm. One common method involves endocytosis. This can occur through endocytosis of caveolin-or clathrin-coated pits, bulk-phase endocytosis, or phagocytosis. l Some enveloped viruses use fusion to enter the cell. This process is mediated by viral fusion proteins and merges the viral envelope with the cell membrane. Section 4.3 Uncoating l Uncoating refers to the breakdown of the viral capsid, releasing the genome into the cell. Unlike a cell, which divides into two, nascent virions are assembled de novo by packaging a copied genome into a newly created capsid. l Many viruses achieve uncoating by escaping from the endosome that they used to enter the cell. Other viruses do not completely uncoat and use the remaining capsid as a home base for replication processes. l Some viruses uncoat at the nuclear envelope immediately before transporting the genome into the nucleus. A few viruses are small enough to pass through the nuclear pores and uncoat in the nucleus. Section 4.4 Replication l There are seven classes of viruses in the Baltimore classification system, which is based upon the type of nucleic acid and replication strategy of viruses: dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, +ssRNA, \u2212ssRNA, RNA viruses that reverse transcribe, and DNA viruses that reverse transcribe. l All human dsDNA viruses, with the exception of poxviruses, must gain entry into the nucleus for replication because of the DNA or RNA polymerases that are present there. dsDNA viruses often transcribe their gene products in waves in order to ensure an ordered process that does not put too much overall stress upon the cell.",

            "text": "Herpesviruses, poxviruses, and adenoviruses are examples of dsDNA viruses that infect humans. l The genome of ssDNA viruses is converted into dsDNA by the host cell DNA polymerase after self-priming. At this point, the replication of DNA and transcription of mRNA are carried out in the same way as dsDNA viruses. Anelloviruses and parvoviruses are examples of human ssDNA viruses. l Human dsRNA viruses, namely reoviruses and picobirnaviruses, are nonenveloped and icosahedral with segmented genomes. To transcribe their genome into vmRNA, they must carry their own RdRp, since the cell does not contain an enzyme that will transcribe mRNA from an RNA template. l The genomes of +ssRNA viruses are infectious, since positive-sense RNA is able to be directly translated by ribosomes. Consequently, +ssRNA viruses do not carry an RdRp protein but instead encode it so it is immediately translated by ribosomes into the RdRp protein. +ssRNA viruses encode a single polyprotein that is cleaved into several different individual proteins. Seven different families of +ssRNA viruses infect humans and include poliovirus, rhinovirus, Norwalk virus, hepatitis C virus, and rubella virus, among many others. l \u2212ssRNA viruses are not infectious and must be transcribed into vmRNA before translation can occur. Therefore, \u2212ssRNA viruses must also carry an RdRp into the cell. \u2212ssRNA viruses have helical ribonucleoprotein complexes that are composed of the viral RNA, the protecting capsid protein, and any associated enzymes. As with +ssRNA viruses, an antigenome is transcribed and acts as a template to create the genome. Ambisense viruses are partially positive sense and partially negative sense. Several well-known human viruses have \u2212ssRNA genomes, including influenza viruses, Ebola virus, rabies virus, measles virus, and mumps virus. l Due to the lack of proofreading ability, RNA polymerases have lower fidelity than DNA polymerases. l New strains of virus can occur when two different strains infect one cell. Recombination occurs when the genome of an RNA virus is being replicated and the RdRp jumps from the template of one strain to the template of the other strain, creating a hybrid genome. Reassortment occurs when the genome segments of segmented viruses are mixed while being packaged into new capsids. l Retroviruses are viruses that reverse transcribe an RNA genome into cDNA. Reverse transcriptase is the enzyme that carries this out and has the activity of an RNAdependent DNA polymerase, DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, and RNase H. HIV, a human retrovirus, becomes a provirus when its IN protein merges the viral cDNA into the host's chromosomal DNA. Transcription and genome replication is carried out by host enzymes.",

This is repaired to a completely double-stranded episome (cccDNA) in the nucleus of the cell. RNA polymerase II transcribes an RNA pregenome that is reverse transcribed, after being packaged into the capsid, into the rcDNA genome.Section 4.5 Assembly l Assembly refers to the packaging of the copied viral genome with newly manufactured viral proteins to create a virion. This can occur in the nucleus, within an organelle like the rER or Golgi complex, or in the cytosol, depending upon the virus. Section 4.6 Maturation l Maturation refers to the final changes that must occur within the virion to create an infectious virion rather than an inert particle. This can involve the modification of cell surface receptors, the cleavage of viral polyproteins, or changes to the viral capsid. Maturation is often tightly linked with assembly and/or release. Section 4.7 Release l Release refers to the exit of the virion from the cell. This most often occurs through the budding of enveloped viruses or via cell lysis.Section 4.8 Virus Growth Curves l One-step growth curves rely on synchronous infection of cells so that the replication process and virion release occur simultaneously in all cells. The eclipse period refers to the amount of time required to assemble infectious virions intracellularly, and the latent period is the amount of time before infectious virions are observed outside the cell. Viruses that infect eukaryotic cells take much longer to replicate than bacteriophages. The eclipse and latent periods will be the same for eukaryotic viruses that obtain their envelope from the plasma membrane, unless maturation occurs after release. ",
