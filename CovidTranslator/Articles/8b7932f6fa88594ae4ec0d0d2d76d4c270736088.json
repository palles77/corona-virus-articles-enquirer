The results for seminested RT-PCR were compared with those determined by in situ hybridization. The results obtained show that the use of deparaffinization with xylene, digestion with proteinase K, extraction with Trizol LS, followed by seminested RT-PCR is a reliable detection method. An increase in sensitivity was observed as amplicon size decreased. The highest sensitivity for RT-PCR on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues RNA was obtained with amplicon sizes less than approximately 200 base pairs. An hybridization signal for CSFV was detected in lymph nodes from 12 experimentally and 12 naturally infected pigs. The sensitivity of seminested RT-PCR compared with in situ hybridization was 100% for CSFV. When only formalin-fixed tissues are available, seminested RT-PCR and in situ hybridization would be useful diagnostic methods for the detection of CSFV nucleic acid.",

Formalin fixation is the standard method for tissue preservation in veterinary pathology and this material forms the major source of tissues for many studies. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues have been used for both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization detection of viral RNA Chung et al., 2002; Choi and Chae, 2003a,b,c) . In situ hybridization is, however, of greater technical complexity and expense when compared with RT-PCR Chae, 2001, 2002) . Therefore, application of the RT-PCR assay for the detection of viral RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is desirable. The development of such techniques is also important as formalin fixation of tissues allows veterinary practitioners to readily ship tissue samples for CSFV identification in a well-preserved, non-infectious state to avoid accidental transmission of this deadly contagious virus during transportation. The objective of this study, therefore, was to develop an optimized protocol for the detection of CSFV directly from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue by seminested RT-PCR and compare this method with in situ hybridization.",

The use of a digestion buffer containing proteinase K was found to yield viral RNA suitable for RT-PCR amplification. Despite the optimized RNA extraction protocol, RNA obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues was still highly degraded and, as such, one would expect smaller amplicon sizes to provide better sensitivity. It has been shown previously that the success of RT-PCR was limited in attempts to amplify large target fragments and that most success was obtained when target amplicons were small (Bresters et al., 1994; Guerrero et al., 1997) .
