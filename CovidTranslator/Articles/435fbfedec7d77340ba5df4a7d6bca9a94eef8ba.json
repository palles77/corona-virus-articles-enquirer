Variant gp120s at 100-200 nM were passed over the modified sensor chips at 30 \u00b5l/min for 5 min, followed by a 5-mindissociation phase to identify rough binding affinities, and then a 2-fold increasing series of gp120 The gp120 glycoprotein displays extraordinary conformational flexibility. To stabilize gp120 into the conformation it assumes when bound by CD4, we devised interdomain disulfides and cavity-altering substitutions. Alteration of an unusual interfacial pocket at the nexus of the inner domain, outer domain and bridging sheet through a S375W mutant was previously found to partially stabilize gp120 in its CD4-bound state [Xiang, S.H. et al. J. Virol. 76, 9888-9899 (2002) ], but we found this mutant prone to aggregate. An additional T257S change, however, resulted in well-behaved protein, and we were able to solve the structure of a S375W, T257S gp120 core bound to CD4 and Fab 17b at 2.0 \u00c5 (supplementary Table 1 ).",

The ribbon diagram depicts the gp120 inner domain (gray), outer domain (red), and bridging sheet (blue), along with stick models of introduced disulfides (with carbon atoms in green) and cavity-altering substitutions (with carbon atoms in magenta). Inset boxes show electron density (2Fo-Fc, contoured at 1\u03c3) corresponding to each mutational substitution. b, Unliganded SIV gp120, with polypeptide in ribbon diagram colored the same as a. Positions corresponding to introduced cysteines are green, with disulfide connections that only form in the CD4-bound conformation highlighted with yellow dashes and with associated C\u03b1 distances. As can be seen, each of the four disulfides is structurally incompatible with the conformation of the unliganded SIV gp120. c, Antigenic analysis of conformational stabilization. The vertical axis corresponds to the change in entropy of each particular gp120 variant upon binding to CD4. In the left panel, the horizontal axis corresponds to the onrate for the CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies, 17b and m6 (in blue and red, respectively). In the middle panel, the horizontal axis corresponds to the on-rate of CD4. In the right panel, the horizontal axis shows the aggregate change in \u2206\u2206G for the 10 CD4-binding-site (CD4BS) antibodies listed in Table 1 . In \u2206\u2206G calculations, a maximal change in affinity of 10 5 was used. All three of the heavy chain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of b12 make extensive contact with gp120. The CDR H1 (197 \u00c5 2 ) uses Arg 28 and Asn 31 to make polar interactions, and Phe 32 to pack hydrophobically over the N-terminal portion of the CD4-binding loop (\u03b215-\u03b13 of gp120). The CDR H2 (245 \u00c5 2 ) inserts between the CD4-binding loop and \u03b220/21, positioning Tyr 53 into a hydrophobic cleft at the C-terminus of the CD4-binding loop. The base of the CDR H3 (276 \u00c5 2 ) also makes extensive contacts with the CD4-binding loop, with both polar (e.g. three hydrogen bonds) and",
