However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV.",

In conclusion, SARS-Cov is the closest related virus to 2019-nCoV for which a significant number of epitopes has been defined in humans (and other species), and that also causes human disease with lethal outcomes.

To predict conformational B cell epitopes, we used SWISS-Model (8) and a SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein structure (PDB ID: 6ACD) to map the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. No templates were found to build reliable models of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and membrane glycoprotein. A list of amino acid positions having a high probability of being included in predicted B cell epitopes for the surface glycoprotein, based on analysis with the Discotope 2.0 algorithm, are shown inTable S1(cutoff of \u2265 -2.5 corresponding to 80% of specificity).

We used the BebiPred 2.0(6) algorithm embedded in the B cell prediction analysis tool available in IEDB(19). For each protein, the epitope probability score for each amino acid and the probability of exposure was retrieved. Potential B cell epitopes were predicted using a cutoff of 0.55 (corresponding to specificity greater than 0.81 and sensitivity below 0.3) andconsidering sequences having more than 7 amino acid residues. Structure-based antibody prediction was performed by using Discotope 2.0 (7), available in IEDB(19) and a positivity cutoff greater than -2.5 was applied (corresponding to specificity greater than or equal to 0.80 and sensitivity below 0.39). Since no PDB structures are available in the Protein Data Bank(PDB) for the three 2019-nCoV proteins, a homology modeling approach was applied using SWISS-MODEL (8). Of the three proteins analyzed, only surface glycoprotein (S) had a PDB template that covered 0.93 of the entire protein based on the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6ACD) with a GMQE score of 0.72 and a QMEAN of -4.08; as such, it was the only model used for the structure-based B cell prediction.
