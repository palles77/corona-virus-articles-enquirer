One of the major cell types to be infected is the alveolar type II cell. However, the innate immune response of primary human alveolar epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV has not been defined. Our objectives included developing a culture system permissive for SARS-CoV infection in primary human type II cells and defining their innate immune response. Culturing primary human alveolar type II cells at an airliquid interface (A/L) improved their differentiation and greatly increased their susceptibility to infection, allowing us to define their primary interferon and chemokine responses. Viral antigens were detected in the cytoplasm of infected type II cells, electron micrographs demonstrated secretory vesicles filled with virions, virus RNA concentrations increased with time, and infectious virions were released by exocytosis from the apical surface of polarized type II cells. A marked increase was evident in the mRNA concentrations of interferon-b and interferon-l (IL-29) and in a large number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. A surprising finding involved the variability of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, the SARS-CoV receptor, in type II cells from different donors. In conclusion, the cultivation of alveolar type II cells at an air-liquid interface provides primary cultures in which to study the pulmonary innate immune responses to infection with SARS-CoV, and to explore possible therapeutic approaches to modulating these innate immune responses.",

Alveolar epithelial cells are known to be susceptible in vivo, but the extent of infection for submerged primary cultures of human type II cells was too limited to define the cytokine and interferon responses to infection. This report demonstrates that primary human alveolar type II cells can be productively infected with SARS-CoV, and that they can generate a vigorous innate immune response. The critical feature for infecting human type II cells with SARS-CoV involves maintaining and infecting the cells under air-liquid interface conditions. Among our unexpected findings, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, the receptor for SARS-CoV, was quite variable among different individuals, and cells from different donors differed in their susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection.",

The robust innate immune response of these cells to SARS-CoV infection consisted of marked elevations in mRNA concentrations of interferon-b, interferon-l, CXCL10, CXCL11, and IL-6, and these results mirror findings reported in the lungs and sera of patients with SARS (22, 23, 25) .",

Subsequently, we evaluated a variety of changes in the culture system to improve the rate of infection. We found that susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection and the maintenance of differentiation were achieved by culturing cells at an A/L on Millicell inserts coated with a matrix of rat-tail collagen and Matrigel, and by providing a medium that contained IL-13 and IL-4 as well as KGF, isomethylbutyl xanthine, 8 Br-cAMP, dexamethasone, and 5% heat-inactivated human serum (30) . Cells contained readily identifiable lamellar bodies according to phase microscopy ( Figure 1A ). In general, increased type II cell differentiation was observed, as evidenced by the expression of the surfactant proteins (SPs) ( Figure 1B ). As shown in Figure 1B , the air-liquid interface condition increased the expression of ACE2, SP-A, proSP-B, proSP-C, and ABCA3, but not fattyacid synthase, compared with the submerged condition in this experiment. However, the magnitude of effect of the A/L condition was more variable with human type II cells than with our experiments on primary rat type II cells (31) ( Figure E1 in the online supplement). In addition, we found an increase in ACE2 expression in our cultures after adding IL-4 and IL-13, a finding that differs from results with Vero E6 cells regarding the effect of IL-13 on ACE2 expression (32) ( Figure 1B ). In general, the level of ACE2 expression, as measured by immunoblotting of wholecell extracts, was slightly increased in type II cells cultured under A/L conditions, but ACE2 concentrations varied considerably between cells from individual donors ( Figure E1 ). However, according to flow cytometry and surface biotinylation, we were unable to detect any increase in the surface expression of ACE2 in cells maintained under A/L conditions, compared with cells maintained in submerged cultures (data not shown).",

Then the apical fluid and inoculum were aspirated, and cells were maintained under A/L conditions. SARS-CoV reproducibly caused productive infection of the primary human alveolar type II cells cultured at the A/L. We found little evidence of infection at 4 hours after virus inoculation, but by 24 hours after virus inoculation, infected cells containing viral antigens in the cytoplasm were readily detected. SARS-CoV-infected cells were readily observed in all primary alveolar type II cultures on Millicell inserts at the A/L, although the percentages of infected cells varied considerably in different areas of the same insert and between different human donors. In four donors, the percentage of cells infected ranged from 3.4-34.2% at 24 hours, and from 2.4-27.2% at 48 hours.",

Because alveolar type II cells at the A/L were readily infected by SARS-CoV, we were able to measure changes in expression of selected genes of the innate immune system in these cells in response to SARS-CoV infection ( Figure 5 ). For technical and biosafety reasons, we did not attempt to measure concentrations of interferon or cytokine proteins from infected cultures. The SARS-CoV infection of type II cells induced markedly increased concentrations of the mRNAs encoding type I and type III interferons, as well as the interferon-responsive genes ISG56, OAS1, Mx1, CXCL10, and CXCL11 ( Figure 5 ). The SARS-CoV infection of type II cultures also elicited large increases in the concentrations of chemokines that recruit inflammatory cells (CXCL8, CCL5, CXCL10, and CXCL11). Thus, human alveolar type II cells are capable of initiating robust innate immune responses that could contribute to the cytokines and chemokines measured in the lungs and sera of patients with SARS. In addition, chemoattractants released by epithelial cells would be expected to recruit inflammatory cells in vivo, and to initiate the innate immune response. ",

In pilot experiments with unselected donors, we detected very little infection of type I-like cells under A/L conditions at 24 hours after inoculation. However, when we undertook screening to select a donor (i.e., patient 101) who expressed a high concentration of ACE2 in the freshly isolated cells, we observed that transdifferentiated type I-like cells could be infected with SARS-CoV ( Figures E1 and E2) .

Human alveolar type II cells maintained at an A/L were well differentiated (Figures 1-3) and permissive for SARS-CoV infection, as shown by immunocytochemistry, by increases in the synthesis of viral RNA and protein, and by the production and release of infectious virions. Although the air-liquid interface culture conditions greatly increased the susceptibility of type II cells to SARS-CoV, the mechanism for this increased susceptibility to infection is not yet established. In the lung, very little fluid is present on the apical surface of the alveolar epithelium (37, 38) . Hence, the A/L conditions approximate conditions in vivo. A/L culture conditions improved the differentiation state of type II alveolar epithelial cells in vitro, and greatly enhanced their susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection.",

When the alveolar epithelium becomes infected, infected cells alert other cells and organs to the infection by secreting cytokines and chemokines. The infected epithelial cells are likely the first responders, and initiate the innate immune response. The earliest response of human alveolar type II cells to influenza virus infection involves the expression of interferon and interferon-responsive genes (40) . Presumably this interferon response increases the resistance of neighboring cells to infection. The next phase of the innate immune response involves the expression of cytokines, which can both attract and activate immune cells and stimulate neighboring cells to amplify the defensive response greatly by secreting additional cytokines and chemokines. The innate response also signals the bone marrow to release additional inflammatory cells and initiates the adaptive immune response to recruit antigen-specific lymphocytes. In this study, we measured the mRNAs encoding interferon-b and interferon-l, and both were markedly elevated in response to SARS-CoV infection. Both of these interferons have been reported to be elevated in experimental SARS-CoV infections in primates and in cell lines infected with SARS- CoV (15, 24, 41) . IL-29 is important in the innate immune response and may help control SARS-CoV infection (29, 41, 42) .",

He and colleagues suggested that resident ACE2expressing lung epithelial cells, and not the subsequently recruited inflammatory cells, constitute the primary source of elevated cytokines in patients infected with SARS-CoV, and that these epithelial-derived cytokines play an important role in the acute lung injury and pathogenesis of SARS (27) . Our data show that type II alveolar cells likely contribute to the high concentrations of cytokines and chemokines detected in the gas-exchange portion of the lungs in patients with SARS. In the sera of patients with SARS, the cytokine that increases most rapidly is CXCL10 (IP-10) (22, 23) . Similarly, in our type II cells at the A/L, the level of CXCL10 mRNA expression increased more than 1,000 fold by 24 hours after virus inoculation ( Figure 5 ). The other cytokine that appears to predict the clinical course and outcome of SARS is IL-6 (43). The concentration of mRNA encoding IL-6 was elevated approximately 10-fold in our SARS-CoV-infected alveolar type II cultures at the A/L ( Figure 5 ). In these particular experiments, we did not evaluate ultraviolet light-inactivated virus, but we knew from previous studies that type II cells do not present a cytokine or interferon response to ultraviolet light-inactivated influenza (40) . Additional studies will be required to define the cell-cell interactions whereby infected epithelial cells signal to nearby uninfected parenchymal cells or inflammatory cells. We found that rat alveolar type I-like cells infected with rat coronavirus stimulated noninfected cells in the culture to secrete cytokines and chemokines through an IL-1-dependent mechanism (30) . Paracrine signaling by IL-1, which is released from infected type II cells during the activation of the inflammasome, may also play important roles, both in protecting type II cells from infection and in amplifying the innate immune response.",

We observed that type II cells from donors who expressed higher concentrations of ACE2 and from culture conditions that increased ACE2 expression generally correlated with a higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection. However, we did not measure ACE2 concentrations in cells from enough different donors who were also inoculated with SARS-CoV, and we did not measure the extent of virus infection to prove this quantitatively. Although immunoblotting showed a modest but variable increase in ACE2 expression by type II cells when cultured at the A/L compared with submerged conditons, we did not detect a consistent increase in the surface expression of ACE2 by either flow cytometry or surface biotinylation (data not shown). Similarly, when we transdifferentiated type II cells at the A/L into type I-like cells that expressed very low levels of ACE2, we observed very little SARS-CoV infection. However, in type I-like cells transdifferentiated from a type II cell donor selected to express high concentrations of ACE2, we did observe the infection of type I-like cells (Figures E1 and E2 ). Because we did not demonstrate a clear increase in the surface expression of ACE2 under A/L conditions, we cannot conclude that the enhanced role of infection of type II cells at the A/L was attributable solely to the concentration of ACE2.",

De Lang and colleagues reported that IL-4 and IL-13 decreased ACE2 expression in Vero E6 cells (32) . However, as shown in Figure 1 , we found that IL-4/IL-13 actually increased ACE2 expression in our primary human alveolar type II cells. Hence, we added IL-4/IL-13 to increase ACE2 expression and thereby increase SARS-CoV infection. We previously reported on the effects of IL-13 on human type II cells, and noted that IL-13 decreases SP-C and SP-D but exerts little effect on SP-A or SP-B (44) . The slight decrease in SP-D could enhance the SARS infection, although this is unlikely, based on our experiments with 229E-6V (another coronavirus), in which SP-D did not make a major difference in the 229E-6V infectability of human alveolar macrophages (45) . Nevertheless, SP-D has been reported to interact with the SARS spike glycoprotein, the attachment protein (46) .",

In pilot experiments, we did not find a consistent increase in CD209L according to flow cytometry under A/L conditions (data not shown). Another consideration involves the details of the inoculation and the volume of apical fluid. In the A/L cultures, the inoculum was aspirated and cells were not washed, so some of the inoculum persisted in the surface fluid for the duration of the experiment. Perhaps the A/L conditions facilitated multiple cycles of virus infection. For example, after the first cycle of virus replication, the newly synthesized virus would be released into the scant amount of fluid on the apical surface, and this concentrated virus might accelerate secondary rounds of infection. In pilot studies, we observed that an increased susceptibility of type II cells to SARS-CoV infection required A/L culture conditions both before and after virus inoculation.",

For this series of experiments, six different donors were used, and all showed a significant increase in SARS-CoV mRNA at 24 hours after inoculation. (B) The production of infectious virus is shown. In this series of experiments, the yields of virus released from the apical (red) or basolateral (black) surfaces or from cell extracts (blue) at 4, 24, and 48 hours after inoculation were titered by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells and expressed as the total virus yield from each insert.
