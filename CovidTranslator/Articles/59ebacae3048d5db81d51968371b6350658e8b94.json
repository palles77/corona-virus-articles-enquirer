Our study found that social media (e.g., Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention to public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.",

Since public participation is required to prevent and control the epidemic spread of infectious diseases, it is extremely important to learn about the public's attention to COVID-19 during the current epidemic. Such knowledge is of great significance when guiding people to respond appropriately to the epidemic and helping them learn how to cope with the sudden infectious disease of COVID-19, and it also supports social stability 27 .",

            "text": "Sina Microblog (\"Weibo\" for short) is one of the most popular social media platforms in China and is equivalent to Twitter within China. As of the fourth quarter of 2018, the number of monthly active users had reached 462 million, and approximately 200 million people are using Sina Microblog every day 41 . The Sina Microblog hot search list is the ranking of the most followed and hottest information on Sina Microblog and is the most popular functional module in Sina Microblog applications 42, 43 . This ranking is sorted according to the search volume of the hot topics that users searched for within a certain period. The higher the search volume is, the higher the ranking is, which directly reflects the public attention and attitude toward the topic. This paper studies public attention given to COVID-19 on Sina Microblog by searching for and analyzing topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020. This is the first time that a Chinese social media platform (i.e., Sina Microblog) has been used to study the public attention of COVID-19 44 . In this study, we describe the trend of public attention given to topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic and the hot topic keywords of public concern, we analyze the emotional tendencies and trends of hot topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic, and we conduct a visual cluster analysis of the hot topic content. This approach is used to obtain timely access to public responses so that the government and the health department can better communicate with the public on health issues and take appropriate measures to prevent and control the epidemic 35, 39 .",

In stage A, \"unknown cause\" and \"new coronavirus\" are the main keywords, indicating that in the initial stage of the epidemic, viral pneumonia had just been discovered, and the cause was unknown. After the pathogen was initially identified as a new coronavirus, the public began to search for information on new coronaviruses to learn relevant knowledge. Compared with stage A, stage B has new keywords such as \"new\", \"mask\", \"first case\", and \"first-level response\". The reason for this is that the COVID-19 epidemic had spread across the country during this stage. The first cases had appeared successively throughout the country, and the number of confirmed cases was increasing. The outbreak of the epidemic made the people and the government aware of the importance of prevention. People began to buy masks, and governments at all levels initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. Compared with the previous two stages, the main keywords appearing in stage C are \"discharged\", \"national\", \"materials\" and \"Huoshenshan Hospital\". At this stage, the public's attention had shifted to material donation and medical service assistance in the key epidemic areas in Wuhan. Moreover, the epidemic had spread throughout the country, and the public was more concerned about the rehabilitation of patients.",

However, there have been no relevant studies that have incorporated social media analysis into the public response to the COVID-19 epidemic. We used the Sina Microblog hot search list to analyze the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, which was 52 days after the first disclosure of COVID-19 by the Chinese health department. There are four main findings from this study. First, we analyzed the changing trend of public attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of the public's attention at each stage are slightly different. In addition, the public's emotional tendency toward the hot search topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic changed from negative to neutral across the study period. As a whole, negative emotions weakened, and positive emotions increased. Finally, we divided the topics of public concern about the COVID-19 epidemic into five categories through social semantic network analysis. This study analyzes the public's response to and attention given to the COVID-19 epidemic, which will help public health professionals monitor public response, identify public needs as early as possible, make timely public health prevention and control measures, and disseminate knowledge to citizens in a targeted manner to better respond to the current COVID-19 epidemic.",

In the first stage (December 31, 2019, to January 18, 2020), the Chinese public paid less attention, as pneumonia was only reported in Wuhan, China. On January 19, 2020, suspected cases appeared in Shanghai and Shenzhen, and body temperatures began to be measured at the Wuhan Airport and Railway Station. People began to notice the severity of the epidemic, and the level of attention paid to the COVID-19 epidemic began to increase until January 26, 2020. We can see that when the epidemic began to spread across the country, the public responded quickly to news of the COVID-19 outbreak on Sina Microblog 39 . This is because COVID-19 is a new infectious disease, which means that no effective treatment has been found and no corresponding vaccine has been developed. When the outbreak began, the public was eager to search the relevant knowledge and information online to meet their own protection needs 27, 30 . In the third stage (January 27 to February 20, 2020), although the number of cases of COVID-19 was still increasing, the number of Sina Microblog topics and search volume was decreasing. The reason for this may be because the epidemic information was relatively saturated, and it was difficult for people to acquire more new knowledge through a Sina Microblog search 27 . It may also be that people are no longer paying close attention to the epidemic dynamic to gain a sense of security as time goes on, and the public's consciousness tends to be rational 51 .",

From the hot search keywords of each stage, we found that the public did not know much about the virus and its causes in the first stage. The main keywords of the search to seek relevant knowledge were \"unknown cause\" and \"novel coronavirus\". During the second stage, the epidemic began to spread throughout the country, the first cases were reported in different areas successively, and the number of confirmed cases continued to increase, thereby making the public and government aware of the importance of prevention. During the third stage, the epidemic spread widely throughout the country; Wuhan was the most seriously affected area, and the city was locked down. The public's attention was mainly shifted to material donation and medical assistance in Wuhan. Compared with a qualitative research, it is more accurate to obtain the hot spots of public attention through keyword frequency analysis, as this process has higher accuracy and credibility in the research of hot spots and their development trends 40 . Based on our high-frequency keyword analysis of the Sina Microblog topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic, we can obtain information about the concerns and opinions of Sina Microblog users at different stages 52 .

The content analysis of social networks can identify people's attitudes or reactions to specific health hazard events 30, 39 . In the first stage, there was less public attention given to the Sina Microblog hot search list. Most of the topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic were about the notification of pneumonia and the virus, and the emotions tended to be negative. At that time, the public had a strong demand for information on public health emergencies such as infectious diseases. When the information demand could not be fully satisfied, the users' emotions were negative 40 . As the epidemic progressed to the second and third stages, the public sentiment tended to be neutral because increasingly more news was reported at this stage, and objective events became the mainstream information on the Sina Microblog hot search list. The public reduced their previous levels of worries and fears about the epidemic; their negative feelings weakened, and their positive emotions increased. More hot search topics mentioned information about prevention or protection, which is conducive to public health communication and promotion.",

From the search of the subject content, we can see that during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, the public, the news media, and the health department all actively used Sina Microblog as a platform for disseminating COVID-19-related information 29 , indicating that Sina Microblog is a communication channel for both individuals or organizations to publicize COVID-19 symptoms, preventive measures and related policies 37 .
