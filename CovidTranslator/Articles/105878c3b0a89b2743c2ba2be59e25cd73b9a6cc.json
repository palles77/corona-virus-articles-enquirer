The first ORF is translated from the full-length genomic mRNA while the remaining ORFs are translated from eight subgeomic RNAs (sgRNAs). In this study, we designed small interference RNAs (siRNAs) targeting sgRNA 2, 3 and 7 and tested their efficiency and specificity in silencing the protein translated from the targeted sgRNA. Our results demonstrated that siRNA 7 could inhibit sgRNA 7, which showed 19/19 nucleotides (nt) matching, and sgRNA 8, which showed 18/19 nt matching; but, it did not inhibit the full-length genomic mRNA which showed 17/19 nt matching. Overall, each of the siRNAs can inhibit the targeted sgRNA without affecting the full-length genomic mRNA or the other sgRNAs that showed mismatch of two or more nt. Thus, siRNA could be designed so as to knockdown the expression of viral protein(s) from a targeted sgRNA during viral infection, thereby allowing the contribution of individual viral proteins to viral infection to be delineated. When Vero E6 cells expressing siRNA 2, 3 or 7 were infected with SARS-CoV, a significant reduction in the yield of progeny virus was observed. Indirect immunofluorescence assays showed that in the infected cells expressing each of the siRNAs, there was aspecific silencing of S, 3a and 7a, respectively, but the expression of nucleocapsid protein was not affected. Thus, our data suggests that the accessory proteins, i.e. 3a and 7a, could play an important role during the replication cycle of the SARS-CoV.",

The first ORF is translated from the full-length genomic mRNA (RNA 1), while the remaining ORFs are translated from eight sgRNAs (RNA two to nine) synthesized as a nested set of 3 co-terminal RNA species in which the leader RNA sequences on the 5 end of the genome are joined to the body sequences at distinct transcription regulatory sequences containing a highly conserved consensus sequence (CS) (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003; Snijder et al., 2003; Thiel et al., 2003; Yount et al., 2003) . As illustrated in Fig. 1 , the full-length genomic contains nearly all the sequences found in any of the sgRNAs, hence it may be expected that siRNA targeting any of the sgRNAs will also affect the translation of the full-length genomic mRNA. Indeed, it was recently reported Fig. 1 . Schematic diagram showing the expression of viral proteins from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome and subgenomic RNAs. Replicase genes (ORFs 1a and 1b) encode for two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (white solid boxes). These are expressed from the full-length genomic mRNA (RNA 1). Expression of the ORF1b gene involves ribosomal frameshifting into the \u22121 frame just upstream of the ORF1a translation termination codon. Open reading frames (ORFs) in the last 1/3 of the SARS-CoV genome are translated from eight subgenomic mRNAs (RNA 2 to RNA 9). Four of these encode the structural proteins (checked boxes), spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N). Another eight SARS-CoV-unique ORFs (grey solid boxes) encode for accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b) with no significance sequence homology to viral proteins of other coronaviruses. All the mRNAs have a common leader sequence (represented by ), which is derived from the 5 end of the genome. that major replicative inhibition effects of siRNA targeting the sgRNAs may be due to the disruption of the full-length genomic mRNA rather than viral protein knockdown (Zheng et al., 2004) .",

Whereas for sgRNA 7, which is used for the expression of accessory protein, 7a and 7b (siRNA 7), a 19 nt insert was chosen because it has a GC content more suitable for RNA interference (see http://www.genscript.com for details). When comparing the sequences of siRNA 2, 3 and 7 to the full-length genomic mRNA (mRNA 1) and the eight sgRNA (mRNA 2-9), it is clear that there are significant differences between them. For example, the number of mismatches between siRNA 2 and the mRNA 1-9 (except for the targeted mRNA 2) varied from 4 to 7. Similarly, for siRNA 3, the number of mismatches (except for the targeted mRNA 3) varied from 3 to 7, and for siRNA 7, the number of mismatches (except for the targeted mRNA 7) varied from 1 to 6.

In order to determine if there is such an effect, two cDNAs, pXJ-CS-nsp1-HA and pXJ-CS-8a-HA (see Table 2 for primer sequences), were constructed. The pXJ3 HA vector allows the expressed protein to be easily detected with an anti-HA antibody (Tan et al., 2004a,b) . Note that in the case of the full length viral genomic RNA (mRNA 1), the first protein in the polyprotein pp1a, i.e nsp1, was chosen to simplify the detection. As shown in Fig. 2B , the expression of 8a-HA was significantly reduced in siRNA 7 stable cell-line when compared to the vector control cell-line or the siRNA 2 and 3 cell-lines. However, there was no significant difference for the expression of nsp1-HA for all the stable cell-lines. Hence, it may be expected that the siRNA 7 will inhibit both sgRNA 7 and sgRNA 8 but not the full length viral genomic RNA (mRNA 1) or the other sgRNAs.",

The amount of virus was deduced by the 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID 50 ), calculations were made from the cytopathic effect (CPE) pared to vector cells, we could see a reduction of progeny virus in all three stable cell-lines by about 70% (Fig. 3A) . Interestingly, the silencing by siRNA 7 appeared to reduce the progeny virus slightly better than the silencing by siRNA 2 or siRNA 3. Possibly, siRNA 7 could inhibit both sgRNA 7 and 8 (see Fig. 2B ) such that the expression of four accessory proteins, 7a, 7b, 8a and 8b, would be knocked down.",

At 24 h after transfection, the cells were infected with SARS-CoV and the amounts of virus produced were determined as described above. Consistent with the results obtained from the stable cell lines, Vero E6 cells that were transiently transfected with siRNA 2, 3 or 7 showed a significantly lower level of progeny virus than cells transfected with siRNA vector or mockinfected cells (Fig. 3B) . Again, siRNA 7 reduced the progeny virus slightly better than siRNA 2 and siRNA 3. In fact, the reduction of progeny virus in cells transiently transfected with the siRNA constructs was more when compared to the stable cell-lines, although the typical transfection efficiency was only 80%. By comparing the fluorescence of the GFP signals in these Fig. 4 . siRNA 2, 3 and 7, which targeted against subgenomic RNA 2, 3 and 7, can specifically silence the expression of S, 3a and 7a, respectively. Vero E6 cells were transfected with siRNA against S, 3a and 7a as indicated in the figure. Transfected cells were mock-infected or infected with SARS CoV at an MOI of 0.01. At 24 hpi cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and then incubated with specific antibodies. The cells were incubated with anti-rabbit or mouse TRITC-conjugated antibodies and analyzed by immunoflourescence assay. GFP expression used for tracking the transfected cells. cells, we observed that the level of siRNA in the stable celllines were somewhat lower than in cells transiently transfected with the plasmid (data not shown), which can explain why we did not observe more pronounced inhibition of yield of progeny virus in stable cell lines expressing these different siRNAs.

In this study, we used the short-interfering RNA (siRNA) technology and the difference at the CS and body sequences junctions for the full-length genomic RNA and sgRNAs of SARS-CoV to design hairpin siRNAs to target specifically sgRNAs 2, 3 and 7 in order to silence the expression of the viral proteins S, 3a/3b, 7a/7b, respectively. First, we used consensus sequence(CS)containing plasmids to mimic the full-length genomic RNA (pXJ-CS-nsp1-HA) and subgenomic RNAs 7 (pXJ-CS-7a) and 8 (pXJ-CS-8a-HA) to determine the specificity of the shRNA constructs. These plasmids contained the CS joined to the initiation codon of the first open reading frame of the full-length genomic RNA (i.e. nsp1) or subgenomic RNAs (i.e. 7a for sgRNA 7 and 8a for sgRNA 8). We found that siRNA 7 could inhibit both sgRNA 7 and 8 (Fig. 2) . The siRNA 7 matches sgRNA 7 perfectly well while the mismatch between siRNA 7 and sgRNA 8 is 1 nt (Table 1 ). In contrast, siRNA 7 did not have an effect on the full length viral genomic RNA (mRNA 1) as the mismatch between siRNA 7 and the full length viral genomic RNA (mRNA 1) is 2 nt.

            "text": "Next, we showed that these siRNAs, when introduced into Vero E6 cells by transient or stable transfection, resulted in a significant reduction in the production of progeny virus (Fig. 3) . IFA also showed the specific knockdown of S, 3a and 7a proteins in infected cells containing siRNA 2, 3 and 7 (based upon the GFP signal), while the expression of the N protein was not affected (Fig. 4) . To our knowledge, this is the first report of inhibition of virus replication by using siRNA against the SARS-CoV accessory proteins. When compared to the inhibition by siRNA against the S protein, siRNA against 3a/3b showed comparable inhibition while siRNA against 7a/7b (and 8a/8b) was slightly more efficient. Our data showed that the siRNA 3 and 7 are able to inhibit the yield of progeny virus, and suggested that the accessory proteins, 7a/7b (and 8a/8b) and 3a/3b, could play important roles during the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. Yount et al. (2005) recently published results from reverse genetics experiments showing that recombinant virus lacking 7a and 7b can replicate as efficiently as wild-type virus, while the deletion of 3a resulted in about 1 log reduction of virus yield. (Yount et al., 2005) . The siRNA 7 was able to reduce the production of progeny viruses in our system, while the recombinant virus with 7a/7b deleted behaved like the wild-type virus. The difference between our data may be explained by the fact that siRNA 7 could inhibit both sgRNA 7 and 8, which are required for the expression of accessory proteins 7a, 7b, 8a and 8b. The simultaneous silencing of these four accessory proteins may also explain why we observed the highest inhibition effect with siRNA 7.",

Western blot analysis was performed using anti-7a antibody to determine if the expression of 7a is silenced by the siRNA. Anti-GFP antibody was used to determine the amount of siRNA in each cell line and anti-actin antibody was used in the Western Blot to check for equal loading of samples in each well. (B) The same cell lines were transfected with pXJ-CS-8a-HA (lanes 1-4) or pXJ-CS-nsp1-HA (lanes 5-8).
