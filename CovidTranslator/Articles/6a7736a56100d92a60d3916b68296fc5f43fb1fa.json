According to WHO, this disease was registered in more than 25 countries of the world, including Russia. Genome structure of more than 40 strains of SARS-CoV isolated from patients in different countries was identified. Virus genome is a plus-sense RNA consisting of 30,000 nucleotides, containing 14 open reading frames (ORF) [2] , 5' cap structure and 3' poly(A) tail. The genome organization is typical of coronaviruses: genes encoding replicase and four structural proteins are arranged in a sequence 5'-rep-s-env-m-n-3' with short 3' and 5' untranslated regions. SARS agent genome contains no hemagglutininesterase gene [2] . On the basis on the results of phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV and other known coronavirus se-quences, this agent formed a new group in the Coronavirus family. New features were detected in the organization of SARS-CoV genome, which can be biologically significant: short \"anchor\" of glycoprotein S, number and location of minor ORF, the presence of single PLP pro copy.",
