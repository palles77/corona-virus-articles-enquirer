Many models were poorly reported and all appraised as high risk of bias. We call for immediate sharing of the individual participant data from COVID-19 studies worldwide to support collaborative efforts in building more rigorously developed and validated COVID-19 related prediction models. The predictors identified in current studies should be considered for potential inclusion in new models. We also stress the need to adhere to methodological standards when developing and evaluating COVID-19 related predictions models, as unreliable predictions may cause more harm than benefit when used to guide clinical decisions about COVID-19 in the current pandemic.",

LW, BVC, GSC, TPAD, MCH, GH, KGM, RDR, ES, LS, EWS, KIES, CW and MvS extracted and analysed data. MD helped interpret the findings on deep learning studies and MB and MCH assisted in the interpretation from a clinical viewpoint. LW and MvS wrote the first draft, which all authors revised for critical content. All authors approved the final manuscript. LW and MvS are the guarantors. The corresponding author attests that all listed authors meet authorship criteria and that no others meeting the criteria have been omitted. Funding: LW is a post-doctoral fellow of Research Foundation -Flanders (FWO). BVC received support from FWO (grant G0B4716N) and Internal Funds KU Leuven (grant C24/15/037).
