Younger (age\u226430) medical staff had higher SDS scores than older staff but this difference was not statistically signficant. (Figure 1 B, t-test, t SDS =1.64, df SDS =83, P SDS =0.11; t-test, t SAS =0.31, df SAS =83, P SAS =0.76). (Table 1) Our results are a reminder not to neglect the mental health of the other medical department staff during the pandemic, including younger medical staff. Intervention including daily living supplies, pre-job training, leisure activities and psychological counseling like the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University advised, were also ongoing in our hospital [4]. Reasonable resting for medical staff may also help relieve stress according to our experience. It's essential for medical staff to keep physical and psychological health during our struggle of COVID-19. SDS and SAS were simple = tools to monitoring the self-mental health [5].
