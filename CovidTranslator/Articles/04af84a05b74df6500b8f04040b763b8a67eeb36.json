The analysiswhich refers to a stated preference framework-contributes to the ongoing discussion of whether benefits resulting from reduced mortality risk should be valued differently depending on the age of the beneficiaries. By focussing on a life-threatening environmental phenomenon I show that the consideration of the individual's age-specific hazard rate is important. If a particular risk affects all individuals regardless of their age so that their hazard rate is ageindependent, VSL is rather constant for people at different age; if hazard rate varies with age, VSL estimates are sensitive to age. The results provide an explanation for the mixed outcomes in empirical studies and illustrate in which cases an adjustment to age may or may not be justified. Efficient provision of live-saving measures requires that such differences to be taken into account.",

The VSL provides a monetary measure of health benefits and represents the ratio at which people are willing to exchange income for risk changes. The VSL is often inferred from information about the individual willingness-to-pay (WTP) to prevent mortality risks. It is an ongoing discussion whether the financing of life-saving measures should be adjusted to individual characteristics (for a comprehensive discussion, see Sunstein 2004) . Adjustment according to age has provoked particularly intense debate. Government agencies pursue different approaches regarding the use of such a ''senior discount''. For example, while the European Commission DG Environment recommends an adjustment to age (European Commission 2000) , an age-dependent VSL is not applied by the US Environmental Protection Agency (Environmental Protection Agency 2003, p. 37) . These different governmental approaches may result from ambiguous findings in the literature with respect to age effects on VSL.",

In contrast to previously published preference studies, the relevance of an individuals' probability of dying for VSL estimates is analysed by using information on a particular risk specification that allows for distinguishing explicitly between two groups exposed to the same risk type. In this paper, mortality risk is defined as the probability of dying in a snow avalanche. While one group (skiers) faces an age-dependent hazard rate, the hazard rate of the others (non-skiers) is rather insensitive to individual characteristics. The paper addresses the question of whether people benefit differently from reduced mortality risks, in particular, whether WTP and VSL is sensitive to age once the individual mortality risk (which can be either sensitive or insensitive to age) is taken into account. Age is considered by calculating the WTP and VSL for particular age classes.",

            "text": "The literature dealing with estimation of VSL is extensive. VSL is discussed in various contexts, such as valuation of reduced health risks (e.g. cancer, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases), work place risks, traffic risks, or risks arising from natural hazards. 1 In general, VSL estimates are dependent on whether they are based on one's overall risk of dying or on a very specific risk of dying, the profile of future income, the remaining life expectancy or the individuals' baseline risk. Among these determinants, the relevance of age in mortality risk assessment is of ongoing interest and has been discussed and analysed in several studies. 2 The theoretical literature defines two key components of how age affects the monetary valuation of reduced mortality risks: (1) the individual hazard rate (probability of dying), and (2) the level of optimal consumption. Shepard and Zeckhauser (1984) discuss the trade-off between an increase in survival probability and the level of consumption. In their simulations, the authors demonstrate that the profile of WTP with respect to age depends on the existence of markets for borrowing and annuities, as such markets influence the individuals' income over time and, hence, the individual consumption path. If no markets exist, the WTP for risk reductions follows an inverted-U shape, with lower values for the youngest and oldest individuals in the population and a peak of payments at the age of 40. However, this shape is dampened considerably when perfect markets for borrowing and annuities are available. A further theoretical discussion of age effects on VSL is provided in Johansson (2002) or Alberini et al. (2004) . These authors also analyse the role of individual hazard rates and the utility of income and argue that theory does not support a general decline of VSL with age. They conclude that, depending on the age sensitivity of the hazard rate and the utility of income, the VSL can either remain age-independent, increase, or decrease with increasing age.",

            "text": "Such theoretical discussions show that age can influence the VSL quite differently. Empirical studies provide evidence for this ambiguous picture. For example, Smith et al. (2004) estimate the VSL for older workers by observing their behaviour (wage-risk trade-offs) on the labour market. Their findings show an increase of compensation requirements with increasing age, which is mirrored in higher VSL figures for older employees. Viscusi and Aldy (2007) examine how VSLs vary with age across the working population considering age-specific fatality risks. Their VSL estimates for different age classes project an inverted U-shape, indicating that VSL figures first rise and then fall with age. A considerable decrease of VSL with age is found in Alberini et al. (2005) , in which the authors estimate the WTP for reduced cardiovascular and respiratory risks. According to their results, people in their 70s state values that are about three-quarters lower than the statements of 30-year-old respondents. Alberini et al. (2004) examine the influence of age and health risks on VSL using data from two contingent valuation studies conducted in Canada and the US. They analyse the individuals' WTP for a reduction in their overall mortality risk-without pointing at a specific risk-and find weak (no) evidence for decreasing VSL with increasing age in the Canadian (US) sample. Liu et al. (2005) refer to mortality risks due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and do not find any influence of age on WTP to eliminate the chance of becoming infected.",

Although public and private institutions (communities, ski resorts) take various precautions (e.g. construction and maintenance of tunnels and barriers, premature blasting of dangerous accumulations of snow) to protect individuals on roads, in residential areas and in ski resorts an element of risk remains. The 10-year average of avalanche-related fatalities amounts to 16 deaths per year. 5 Unfortunately 43.5% did not answer the question relating to their income, which complicates the estimation of the income effect. In order to avoid losing these observations, a single imputation method (Davey et al. (2001) , Little and Rubin (1987) , Whitehead (1994) ) was applied and missing income is replaced by the mean income of employed persons in the individual's residence. In addition, a dummy variable is generated which equals 1 in cases where a replacement has been made to control for potential influences of the imputation. 6 Health categories were provided in the form of functionality examples (healthy: no diseases or only occasional short-lived diseases such as flu; moderate illness: chronic diseases such as hay fever and allergies; severe illness/severe disability: severe chronic illness or severe physical impairment, in need of long-term care). 7 992 respondents in autumn and 672 in winter were asked to value the prevention of an increase from 1/42,500 to 2/42,500 (=group 1). 333 individuals (=group 2) in the winter sample based their decisions on a hypothetical prevention of a three times higher increase from 1/42,500 to 4/42,500 (=quadruplication of baseline risk).",

Protesters (N = 329) were excluded from further analyses. 10 Avalanche protection of roads and residential areas are usually financed by national, federal and municipal funding. Analogous to the Austrian social security system, which finances publicly provided health services through compulsory insurance premiums, 'insurance premium' was used as a parafiscal payment vehicle that respondents are familiar with. This approach was chosen to avoid respondents' negative attitudes towards taxes. 11 In order to reduce the difficulty of interpreting small risk variations (Kunreuther et al. 2001, Shanteau and Ngui 1989) , I considered the recommendation of Corso et al. (2001) and visualised the risk change in question. In the Tyrolean study, a logarithmic scale was implemented to picture the risk variation (see Fig. 1 ; graph shown for the smaller change). The bottom and top indicate low and high risk, respectively. Along the risk ladder, other mortality risks, such as cancer, AIDS, or car accidents were plotted to enable a comparison and relative estimate. Additionally, the magnitude of the risks was also stated as number of affected persons in differently sized populations (e.g. small town, city).",

This approach assumes that individuals maximise their expected remaining present value utility (ERPVU) subject to a dynamic budget constraint. Solving the maximisation problem results in the maximal ERPVU at age s, denoted by V s (s), conditional on having survived until age s (for details, see Johansson 2001):",

Hence, respondents are expected to have at least non-negative WTP values so that a distribution that allows only zero or positive values is appropriate. A naturally positive distribution is therefore used to estimate WTP. 12 The hazard function denotes the probability of dying after age s conditional on attaining age s. 13 The central findings in this paper are based on the comparison of two sub samples that consist of individuals of all ages (but differ in their hazard rate). Hence, potential changes in consumption patterns should occur in both samples and the size may be similar for both groups.

In order to examine the influence of age on WTP for the two groups of hazard rates (skiers/non-skiers), indicator variables for age classes-defined according to Viscusi and Aldy (2007) -are included as explanatory variables in the regressions. 17 The observations of respondents aged 18 and older were used, and were classified into six age classes: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-62, and 63?. The theoretical arguments given in Shepard and Zeckhauser (1984) , Johansson (2002) , and Alberini et al. (2004) show that the impact of age on the VSL is ambiguous and depends primarily on the individual hazard rate and optimal level of consumption. Under the assumption that skiers and non-skiers differ only in their hazard rate (higher age-specific avalanche risks for skiers vs ageindependent risks for non-skiers), the skier's VSL is expected to have a larger age-gradient than the non-skier's VSL. For non skiers, the VSL should even be quite constant over age as their hazard rate is age-independent (see the theoretical analysis above).",

The risk of getting caught in an avalanche in their own homes or while in a car, bus or train is independent of the individual resident's age. 18 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the avalanche risk for non-skiers is 14 Previous sensitivity analyses have shown that models assuming a Weibull or log-normal distribution of the error term leads to similar findings concerning the sensitive factors on WTP. Additionally, also a logistic and normal distribution was used, simultaneously allowing for a positive probability of zero responses (analogous to Tobit models). The results in these models also correspond quite well with the findings for the Weibull and log-normal distribution. However, regarding the log likelihood values, the Weibull model is superior to the other distribution assumptions. 15 The error term in the Weibull follows the Type I extreme value distribution where the scale parameter varies across individuals: w i = exp(X i b). 16 CBA are associated with potential pareto improvements. A change is favoured if nobody is getting worse but at least one individual can improve his/her status or, respectively, if the winner of an action could compensate the loser. The mean takes into account such considerations (Carson 2000) . 17 Conducting separate regressions for each age class would postulate an adequate sample size for each group, which is not given by the Tyrolean data set. 18 Clearly, an individual's health status and their fitness also determine the probability of survival once caught in an avalanche.

What is of relevance in this context is not the absolute number of skiers who died in avalanches but their probability of dying, which depends on the number of people exposed to additional avalanche risks (i.e. skiers).

Dividing the average number of avalanche-related fatalities of (back country) skiers in the 5-years period 2004/2005-2008/2009 by the number of skiers in the population leads to the skiers' conditional probability of dying in an avalanche (seventh column). This probability-conditional to being a skier-shows that the probability of dying in an avalanche is lowest for 55-to 62-year-olds and peaks for 45-to 54-year-olds. 20 The level and intensity of risk exposure (e.g. how often skiers go on ski trips or back country tours; the ability to adequately respond to challenging terrains) among skiers depend on their (physical) abilities and skills. As Table 2 indicates, the probability of being a skier and therefore being potentially at (higher) risk varies with age.

However, when risk perception is regressed on a set of variables and the error term is included as additional explanatory variable in the original equation, the error coefficient does not reveal a significant influence on WTP.

Surprisingly, respondents in the winter sample state a significantly lower financial contribution although avalanche events often occur in this period. From previous analyses it can be inferred that interviewees in winter who consider avalanches as humancaused events state a significantly lower WTP, and that the ''outrage effect'', as discussed in Kahneman et al. (1993) or more recently in Bulte et al. (2005) , is weaker than the ''responsibility effect'' (Walker et al. 1999) for respondents in winter. 23 The lower WTP statements of those who consider avalanches as human-caused events indicate that these respondents are not willing to support risk-reduction programmes in situations where people at risk voluntarily choose their level of risk exposure and, hence, are themselves responsible for their risk experience. This result also indicates that the claim for responsible behaviour outweighs the potential upset (outrage) involved with man-made adverse situations (i.e. those which would not have occurred without human intervention) and the individual's willingness to correct man-made harm accordingly. Once the sample is split into two groups, an interesting pattern concerning these significant variables can be observed.

The differences in WTP between the reference group of 18-to 24-year-old skiers and the age classes 35-44 and 63?, respectively, are statistically significant. 25 This analysis supports the hypothesis made: age variation is more pronounced for the group of skiers and is statistically significant within this group only. There is evidence that age-sensitivity matters for the valuation of fatality risks and that age-dependent hazard rates play a crucial role in explaining the variation in VSL figures: age effects occur for individuals whose mortality risk due to avalanches is age-dependent, while no age effects are observable for respondents whose risk level is independent of their age. 26 These results suggest that policies that aim at an efficient provision of live-saving measures have to take into account such variations in the beneficiaries' hazard rates.

This means that, based on the tendency shown in Table 2 , the 45-54 (55-62) yearolds with the highest (lowest) conditional probability of dying in an avalanche should reveal the highest (lowest) WTP. But the estimated WTP paints a different picture: WTP of 55-62 (45-54) year-olds is the highest (third lowest) value. This admittedly rough and simplified comparison could lead to a premature conclusion that skiers do not correctly predict their risk of dying in an avalanche (i.e. they rather base their decision on subjectively perceived risk levels). However, one has to keep in mind that such a statement is based on strong assumptions. The skiers' remaining life expectancy and their potentially time-variant utility of consumption are further determinants of the VSL (see ''Estimation procedure''), which may explain these deviations.",

It is often questioned whether it is appropriate to use both answers from a DBDC format. The resulting estimates are inconsistent when the responses to 26 These findings are also in line with the findings in Viscusi and Aldy (2007) , who discuss the relevance of age-specific hazard rates for VSL estimates in a revealed preference setting. the follow-up questions do not reveal utility-maximising behaviour or rational preferences but are influenced by various factors such as yea-saying, weariness or free-riding (see for example, Herriges and Shogren 1996; Bateman et al. 2001; McFadden 1994; Park 2003 ). An alternative to deal with these problems would be to consider only the first response to the payment question. The disadvantage of this approach is that one forgoes a gain in statistical efficiency provided by the follow-up responses (e.g. Alberini 1995; Hanemann et al. 1991) . This means that a trade off between bias and efficiency exists. In order to check how the results vary using the singlebounded approach the same regressions discussed for the DBDC format but ignoring the responses to the second question are conducted. The coefficients estimated do not change considerably. For example, using the sample of skiers, the corresponding coefficients on the age dummies age25-34, age35-44, age45-54, age55-62, and age63? are -0.202, -0.077, -0.205, 0.349, and -0.655.

If protection measures that aim at protecting a wide population whose mortality risks do not depend on individual characteristics such as age are at stake (i.e. risk exposure is the same for all beneficiaries), an adjustment of the resulting benefits to age is not justified. In this setting, non-skiers belong to this group as they reveal similar WTP across all ages. A ''senior discount'' as sometimes proposed would contradict the individual statements. In the context of preventing fatal avalanche accidents, an age adjustment in VSL measures is appropriate solely for skiers. In this case, policies that simply use an overall value but do not control for such variation ignore the diversity in benefits and, hence, lead to an insufficient provision of (environmental) risk-reducing measures.",

Hence, the average respondent refers the WTP statement to the smaller risk change. Calculating separate WTP values for the larger risk reduction would lead to imprecise estimates due to the low number of observations, particularly in the upper age classes. 25 There are further considerable deviations in absolute WTP values (e.g. between age-class 35-44 and 55-62 or 55-62 and 63?) but they are statistically insignificant due to large standard errors and the small sample size in the penultimate age class.",
