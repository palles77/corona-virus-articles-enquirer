            "text": "Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are among the most common diseases to affect humans with typical symptoms, such as rhinitis, cough, fever, and sore throat. 1 Most of these infections are caused by viruses. Bacterial RTIs are less common and often develop after a viral infection. In children <5 years, 95% of the sore throat cases are caused by viruses; 85%-95% in adults. Only in the group of 5-to 15-year-old children, this percentage is reduced to 70%. 2 Viruses associated with RTIs are picornaviruses (human rhinoviruses [HRV] ), coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human coronavirus [hCoV] OC43), ortho-and paramyxoviruses (influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), and respiratory syncytial virus), and adeno-and herpesviruses. 3 RTIs are transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets or indirectly via contaminated surfaces. 4 A reduction of the viral load on the site of infection reduces the risk of transmission via both routes while simultaneously reducing the symptoms of the patients and a potential spread of infection to the lower respiratory tract. Locally acting lozenges or sprays reach the site of infection directly, hereby minimizing potential side effects due to limited systemic uptake while maximizing efficacy.",

            "text": "Lozenges containing the antiseptics and local anesthetics amylmetacresol (AMC)/dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) or hexylresorcinol (HR) are commonly used to treat the symptoms of sore throat. In 2005, Oxford et al 5 published that lozenges containing AMC and DCBA showed some virucidal effect in vitro on three enveloped viruses, such as RSV, influenza A virus, and a member of the coronavirus family, SARS-CoV. However, they were not active against non-enveloped HRV2 and a not otherwise specified member of adenovirus group C. Recently, Shephard and Zybeshari 6 showed some virucidal effect of AMC/DCBA and HR either as free substances or processed into lozenges on PIV3 and Cytomegalovirus or on PIV3 only, respectively. The mechanism of the virucidal action is not clear. However, the authors suggest a denaturation of external protein spikes, a pH-induced rearrangement of the tertiary structure of attachment proteins, or some selective effect on viral lipid membranes/protein-lipid interaction to be responsible for the morphological changes and the virucidal action. 5, 6 An approved antiviral that interacts with the viral surface is iota-carrageenan, a high molecular weight sulfated polymer derived from the red seaweed. The antiviral activity of iota-carrageenan is well-established. We published that it is a potent inhibitor of HRV1a, 2, 8, 14, 16 , and 83 7 and influenza virus A replication in vitro and in vivo 8 and demonstrated the antiviral efficacy against common cold viruses by intranasal administration in several randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trials. [9] [10] [11] [12] In order to treat viral throat infections, we developed lozenges containing 10 mg iota-carrageenan/lozenge as an active ingredient. Ten milligrams were chosen to guarantee antiviral activity throughout the whole dissolution process in the mouth, where all the lozenges components are diluted due to saliva production.",

In the case of the AMC/DCBA/HR lozenges, the applicable dilutions for the hCoV OC43 HAI assay were limited to dilutions \u22651:8 (lozenges #2, #5 , #8, and #9) or \u22651:32 (lozenges #3, #4, #6, and #7) because of a hemolytic effect of the lozenges solutions on chicken erythrocytes. Carrageenan containing lozenges did not show any hemolytic effect (data not shown). From all AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges tested, only lozenge #5 (AMC/DCBA) is active against hCoV OC43 at a dilution of \u22641:27. In contrast, the limit of the activity of lozenge #1 (carrageenan) was not reached under these assay conditions, indicating that it is at least 1622-fold more effective against hCoV OC43 than the most active of the AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges (lozenge #5) and 1368-to 5474-fold more effective than the other tested AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges with an MIC of carrageenan of <0.032 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 1 ).",

Currently a series of such lozenges with the same active ingredients but different flavors is available; additionally, lozenges were marketed, containing HR, as active agent. Shephard and Zybeshari 6 tested the virucidal effect of AMC/DCBA and HR either as free substances or processed into lozenges. The experimental setup was the same in both publications. Lozenges were diluted in 5 or 4.5 mL artificial saliva or medium. Nine parts of the lozenges solution were then directly mixed with one part of the respective virus stock at a known titer. After different contact times, the residual infective virus was determined using quantitative titration. Oxford et al 5 also checked for morphological changes using electron microscopy and found clumping of viruses and denaturation of spike proteins within 2 minutes of contact time. From these results it is concluded that lozenges containing either AMC/DCBA or HR might exhibit a local antiviral effect in patients with sore throat due to viral RTIs. However, the experimental setup does not allow the extrapolation of these data to a potential clinical effect. Dissolution of the lozenge in the mouth stimulates saliva production, resulting in a flow rate of 1.5-6 mL saliva/minute. 14 As a consequence, 20-80 mL saliva were produced during the whole dissolution process of 13 minutes and 20 seconds.

We chose, as members of the picornavirus family (non-enveloped), HRV1a, HRV8, and Coxsackievirus A10, and influenza virus A H1N1n, as a representative of the orthomyxovirus family (enveloped). Additionally, we hypothesized that denatured spike proteins lose their ability to cause hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes. Therefore, we utilized an adapted HAI assay to determine the effect of the observed morphological changes. We chose enveloped hCoV OC43 as a representative of the coronaviruses, as they were responsible for ~20% of RTIs. 3 The AMC/DCBA/HR containing lozenges were tested head to head with carrageenan containing lozenges. To allow for the different lozenges to be compared directly despite their different active ingredients, instead of the conventional half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 , in replication inhibition assays) or MIC (in HAI assay) of the specific antiviral, ID 50 or MIDs of the lozenges solutions were calculated.",
