Low circulating levels of PCT appear to correlate with the presence of viral infection and/or the absence of bacterial infection. Although circulating levels of CRP show a correlation with PCT and are generally low in patients with viral infection, a considerable amount of patients had moderately This study has some limitations. Apart from the small cohort size, a major drawback is the fact that we almost uniformly included patients with viral infections. To be able to analyze the diagnostic properties of PCT, CRP and leukocyte counts in differentiating viral and bacterial infections, a group of children with bacterial infection from the same cohort is needed. However, many earlier studies have shown that values of PCT during bacterial infection in children can be elevated. 5e7 In children with flu-like symptoms, a rapid and adequate diagnosis is of great importance. Reliable biomarkers that are readily available may enhance and quicken the diagnostic process. Based on our findings, PCT may be of added value when the treating physician is uncertain whether to withhold antibiotics.

Recently, the World Health Organization announced the confirmation of wild poliovirus serotype 1 in seven samples from children with acute flaccid paralysis in Tajikistan, in the context of a multidistrict cluster starting in December 2009. As of 28 April, 2010, 32 of 171 reported cases were laboratory-confirmed and closely related to virus from Uttar Pradesh, India. 2 There might be gaps in immunity to poliomyelitis in the examined subjects. In a sero-epidemiological study at the University of Milan, to investigate immunity against poliomyelitis in a population of drug addicts in a rehabilitative residential centre there was a widespread lack of poliovirus neutralizing antibodies. That was more evident in the HIVpositive subjects, 27% of whom were seronegative for poliovirus type 1, 27% for type 2 and 34% for type 3, with 11% seronegative for all three types. These results indicate a gap in immunity to poliomyelitis in the examined population. 3 Investigations would also be needed to identify poliovirus sero-negative natives among either the HIV-positive or HIVnegative in the seventh or higher decades. They might have never been vaccinated against poliomyelitis. Vaccines were not available during their infancy or early childhood. They could be afflicted with locally circulating polioviruses or a travel associated poliomyelitis. Two healthy adult males, ages 62 and 65 years, on their trip to Morocco were afflicted with acute flaccid paralysis while on holidays. 4 ",
