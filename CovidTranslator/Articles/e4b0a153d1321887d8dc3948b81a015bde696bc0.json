What types of signs and symptoms should we encourage parents to look for to distinguish complicated from uncomplicated colds? When and what types of tests are appropriate for evaluation of the persistent cough? Chronic cough can be defined as a persistent cough of more than 3-weeks duration. There are many causes, and most should be considered based on age of the child. Although the more common sources of chronic cough are to be stressed, the less common sources are not to be ignored. Infants are more likely to suffer with congenital malformations leading to chronic cough. Toddlers are prone to aspirate foreign bodies. School-aged children may present with signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis or even cystic fibrosis. Adolescents may expose themselves to inhaled irritants such as tobacco or glue. The presence of psychogenic cough is also more prevalent in adolescents.",

The common cold is the most frequent upper respiratory tract infection (UIU). Wald et alZ0 studied the usual duration of community-acquired viral URI and the incidence of complications (otitis media/sinusitis) of these URI in infancy and early childhood. Children in daycare were found to be more likely to have protracted respiratory symptoms than children in home care. The mean duration for a single URI ranged from approximately 7 days (for 1-2 year olds in home care) to approximately 9 days (for children younger than 1 year old in daycare). The percentage of simple URIs lasting more than 15 days ranged from 6.5% (for 1-year-old to 3-year-old children in home care) to 13.1% (for 2-year-old to 3-yearold children in daycare). Symptoms of the common cold include sneezing, rhinorrhea, cough, mild sore throat, congestion, low-grade fever, and malaise. Acetaminophen, oral fluids, rest, and saline nose drops with gentle suction are the only treatments generally recognized as safe and partially effective. Symptoms usually abate in 5 to 7 days. When a child begins to recover and develops localized pain such as earache, chest, throat or facial pain, increased irritability or lethargy, decreased oral intake, high fever, a new purulent nasal discharge, difficulty breathing, or night and day cough, complications such as pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis or lower respiratory tract infection should be suspected. The real challenge is to distinguish between recurrent or persistent colds that need more time and complications that require medical intervention.",

Despite the extensive differential, the three most common causes of chronic cough are viral URIs, reactive airway disease, and sinusitis. Looking carefully for signs and symptoms of serious disease (see list), recognizing that the age of the patient is associated with specific types of chronic cough (see Table l ), and understanding the character of the cough and its cause affect management decisions. By considering these three factors in addition to a thorough history and physical examination, many expensive, low-yield laboratory tests can be avoided. Although cost-effective, this approach must be combined with a skillful exploration of the parents' concerns and needs.",

If a thorough history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation reveal nothing atypical of asthma, a trial of oral or inhaled p2 agonists with or without a spacer can be tried. An older child may be able to perform a peak expiratory flow in the office to further assess bronchospasm in addition to pre-and post-bronchodilator therapy. It is important to counsel patients concerning the proper use of the inhalers and the correct dose before a decision is made to abandon this line of therapy. If the patient responds equivocally or partially to bronchodilator, a short course of high dose oral corticosteroid should be given. This is the patient who will benefit from chronic anti-inflammatory therapy. Sinus radiographs have significant false-positive and false-negative results in the presence of simple URIs and documented sinusitis. If sinusitis is expected clinically, a course of antibiotics should be admini~tered.'~ Forty percent of sinusitis clears spontaneously, however. A frank discussion with the parents concerning the value of antibiotics in this setting is generally prudent. MR imaging, rhinoscopy, ultrasound, and CT scans are not likely to be useful. A history of recurrent sinusitis and pneumonia should lead to a nasal biopsy to rule out immotile cilia syndrome.",
