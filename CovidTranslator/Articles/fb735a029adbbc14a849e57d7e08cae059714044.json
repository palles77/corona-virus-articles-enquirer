Increased aminopeptidase activity and increased expression of CD13/aminopeptidase N protein were found in alveolar macrophages from CVD patients with interstitial lung diseases. Significantly higher aminopeptidase activity was detected in pleural effusions from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) than in transudate effusions. The mean aminopeptidase activity in synovial fluids from RA patients was significantly higher than from patients with osteoarthritis. The mean value of serum aminopeptidase activity was significantly higher in patients with SLE, RA, SSc, and PM/DM than in normal subjects. This study suggests that the activity of CD13/aminopeptidase N, locally produced in the disease site, is a useful marker for CVD and that CD13/ aminopeptidase N may have an important role in the pathogenesis of CVD.",

CD13/aminopeptidase N is widely distributed in a variety of mammalian cells such as monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells [3, 4, 5, 6] . CD13/aminopeptidase N is the major receptor for human coronavirus [7] and gastroenteritis virus [8] and has an important role in HIV entry [9] . This peptidase was shown to be involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix in tumor invasions [10, 11] and the processing of peptide for presentation by antigen-presenting cells [12] . Recently we reported that CD13/aminopeptidase N has the chemotactic activity of T lymphocytes in vitro [13] .",

In this study, we examined the activity of CD13/aminopeptidase N in patients with CVD and found increased activity and expression of it at the disease site and in serum, suggesting an important role in the pathogenesis of CVD. Serum Sampling Serum was collected from 61 patients with CVD (Table 1 ). The diagnosis of CVD was based on American College of Rheumatology criteria. The CVD patients included 17 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 21 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ten with systemic sclerosis (SSc), eight with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), and five with Sjo\u00a8gren's syndrome (SjS). Normal volunteers consisted of seven young doctors, none of whom showed any abnormalities on physical examination or chest radiography.

The resulting cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of loading buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl [6.8] , 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 2 mg/ml methyl green, and 10% glycerol). Fifty micrograms of protein were subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS running buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3]), 192 mM glycine, and 0.1% SDS). After electrophoresis, the protein bands were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA) in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 20% methanol. The blots were pretreated with 1% skim milk and incubated with antihuman CD13 antibody as primary antibody and biotinylated antimurine IgG as secondary antibody. The reacted proteins were visualized using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, Calif., USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphatebuffered solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 was used as a washing buffer throughout the blotting experiments.",

The aminopeptidase family mainly consists of leucine aminopeptidase (E.C.3.4.11.1), CD13/aminopeptidase N (E.C.3.4.11.2), and cystyl aminopeptidase (E.C.3.4.11.3) [21, 22] . L-leucine-AMC, which was used in this study as a substrate to detect the aminopeptidase activity, could be cleaved by leucine aminopeptidase and CD13/ aminopeptidase N but not by cystyl aminopeptidase [21] . Additionally, cystyl aminopeptidase is mainly localized in placental lysosomes [21] . Leucine aminopeptidase is generally located in liver and has an optimal pH degree of 10. On the other hand, CD13/aminopeptidase N was located in all tissues studied, in which the optimal pH is neutral (pH 6.5-8.5) [24] . These findings indicate that increased aminopeptidase activity in the disease site of CVD may be predominantly composed of CD13/aminopeptidase N. The BALF from patients with CVD-IP contained higher aminopeptidase activity than that from control subjects. Activated macrophages have an important role in initiating and amplifying immunologic and inflammatory responses in various inflammatory lung diseases including CVD-IP [23, 24] . CD13/aminopeptidase N expressed in macrophages was shown to be an ectoenzyme marker that increases as macrophages mature or become activated [4] . In this study, increased activity and expression of CD13/aminopeptidase N protein were found in AM from patients with CVD-IP, indicating that AM may be responsible for the aminopeptidase activity detected in the BALF from CVD-IP patients. However, CD13/aminopeptidase N has also been reported to be expressed in fibroblasts, neutrophils, and endothelial cells [3, 4, 5, 6, 25, 26] . Further studies are necessary to determine the cells responsible for aminopeptidase in BALF.",

These results suggest that enzymatically active CD13/aminopeptidase N has a role in the migration of T lymphocytes to the disease site of CVD. On the other hand, CD13/aminopeptidase N is known to be present on cell surface as the membrane-bound enzyme and can cleave N-terminal amino acids from oligopeptides [1] . Recent reports demonstrated increased aminopeptidase activity in urine from patients with diabetic nephropathy [30] and carboplatin-induced renal damage [31] and those treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy [32] .
