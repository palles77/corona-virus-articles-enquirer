We found that in vitro stimulation with IBV resulted in ChIFN-\u03b3 production in splenocytes of both infected birds and uninfected birds. The non-specific stimulation did not occur when other avian viruses or other coronaviruses were used or when mammalian cells were stimulated with IBV. Inactivation of IBV reduced ChIFN-\u03b3 production, but ChIFN-\u03b3 remained elevated compared to unstimulated cells. An increase in ChIFN-\u03b3 mRNA was detected in splenocytes from IBV-infected and uninfected chickens as early as 1 h after stimulation with IBV. These results indicate that IBV acts as a polyclonal stimulus, inducing a rapid production of IFN-\u03b3 even without previous exposure to the virus.",

            "text": "Infectious Bronchitis Virus is a coronavirus of limited structural complexity that causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease in poultry. As well as being an economically relevant pathogen in poultry, IBV also bears close resemblance to the human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; Cavanagh, 2003) . In order to study the immune responses to IBV in poultry in more detail, techniques are required that provide information about the immune cells participating to the response on a single-cell level. It has been shown that CD8 + T cells play an important role in controlling IBV infection (Collisson et al., 2000) . Furthermore, it is known that interferons are actively involved in the immune response against IBV (Hackney et al., 2003; Otsuki et al., 1988) . Most of the techniques that are available to study T-cell responses in poultry do not provide any information about the response on single-cell level. We developed an ELISPOT assay and intracellular cytokine staining for the detection of ChIFN-\u03b3 production, which is often used as an indicator of T-cell activity (Ariaans et al., 2008b) .",

After 48 h, culture supernatants were collected and half of the samples were incubated at 65\u00b0C for 30 min. Supernatants were tested using a commercial ELISA for ChIFN-\u03b3. Recombinant ChIFN-\u03b3 protein (10 ng/ml) with or without heat treatment was included as a control. Groups with different letters are significantly different (p b 0.05). 5 . ELISPOT for detection of ChIFN-\u03b3 produced by splenocytes of 4 chickens after 24 h incubation with the following stimuli: culture medium, ConA (10 \u03bcg/ml), PMA (100 ng/ ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml), 10 5 EID 50 IBV M41 before (IBV pre) sucrose purification, IBV M41 pooled from the 3 IBV-richest sucrose fractions (IBV post1, \u223c10 5 EID 50 ) and pooled from 3 surrounding fractions (IBV post2, \u223c 10 5 EID 50 ), a pool of 3 sucrose fractions outside the IBV band (residue, same volume as 'post2' sucrose fraction), and allantois from an IBV-uninfected egg. Groups with different letters are significantly different (p b 0.05). stimulation. This increase was detected not only in in vitro stimulated splenocytes of chickens that had previously been exposed to IBV, but also in splenocytes of IBV-na\u00efve chickens. Furthermore, two chicken viruses that are not members of the Coronaviridae family, the avian paramyxovirus NDV and the retrovirus REV, did not induce ChIFN-\u03b3 production in splenocytes of uninfected chickens. IBV did not induce production of IFN-\u03b3 by leukocytes of mammalian origin, cow PBMC. This indicates that the observed IFN-\u03b3 production appears to be a specific interaction between IBV and its natural host, and not an effect generally observed after exposure of non-avian leukocytes to IBV, or of chicken leukocytes to non-avian coronaviruses or to other avian viruses.",

Chicken splenocytes were in vitro stimulated with members of the other coronavirus groups that have mammalian hosts, the group 1 coronavirus FIPV and group 2 coronavirus MHV. Both viruses did not induce ChIFN-\u03b3 production by chicken splenocytes. For MHV several studies have shown a clear difference in IFN-\u03b3 production between infected and uninfected mice by ELISA and qPCR (Hooks et al., 2003; Lucchiari et al., 1991) . Elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA were detected in a pilot study with a FIPV-infected cat when compared to uninfected cats (Kiss et al., 2004) . Castilletti et al. (2005) showed that the group 4 human SARS-CoV, which is thought to be closely related to IBV, induced both IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA and protein after stimulation of PBMC from healthy donors in a dose-dependent manner within 24 h, without the need for viral replication. They suggest that exposure of PBMC to high virus titers in vivo at the site of infection is biologically likely and as such concomitant activation of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 after first-time exposure to relatively high levels of coronavirus might be relevant to the pathogenesis of the disease. A comparison between PBMC of healthy donors and SARS patients was not made, and it therefore remains unknown whether the kinetics of IFN-\u03b3 production after exposure to SARS-CoV is similar in SARS patients and healthy donors.",

Infection with these viruses leads to leukocyte influx and damage of respiratory tract epithelium. Matthijs et al. (in press) found very high numbers of macrophages and CD4 + T cells in trachea and lung of IBV H120 and M41 infected birds. The local immune deregulation might in turn give rise to enhanced susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, such as colibacillosis in poultry after IBV infection, or to organ destruction and pneumonia-like symptoms in the case of SARS. Interestingly, highly elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3 and related cytokines and chemokines, a so-called \"cytokine storm\", were found already at the day of fever onset in SARS patients (Huang et al., 2005) , and improperly modulated IFN type I and II responses are thought to be closely linked to the clinical course of SARS (Cameron et al., 2007) . These elevated cytokine and chemokine levels could be one of the causes of the observed leukocyte influx in the lungs and this in turn could result in the organ destruction and immune system exhaustion that are a hallmark of SARS. Unfortunately, the cytokine kinetics in the SARS study were examined at a later time interval than in our study and can therefore not support or disprove the possibility of SARS-CoV acting as a polyclonal stimulus.",
