            "text": "Electron microscopic morphometry was used to study the development of lung injury during and after chronic (78 weeks) exposure to a pattern of ozone (0,) designed to simulate high urban ambient concentrations that occur in some environments. The daily exposure regimen consisted of a 13-hr background of 0.06 ppm, an exposure peak that rose from 0.06 to 0.25 ppm, and returned to the background level over a 9-hr period, and 2hr downtime for maintenance. Rats were exposed for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks. Additional groups of rats exposed for 13 or 78 weeks were allowed to recover in filtered clean air for 6 or 17 weeks, respectively. Rats exposed to filtered air for the same lengths of time were used as controls. Samples from proximal alveolar regions and terminal bronchioles were obtained by microdissection. Analysis of the proximal alveolar region revealed a biphasic response. Acute tissue reactions after 1 week of exposure included epithelial inflammation, interstitial edema, interstitial cell hypertrophy, and influx of macrophages. These responses subsided after 3 weeks of exposure. Progressive epithelial and interstitial tissue responses developed with prolonged exposure and included epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and interstitial matrix accumulation. The epithelial responses involved both type I and type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type I cells increased in number, became thicker, and covered a smaller average surface area. These changes persisted throughout the entire exposure and did not change during the recovery period, indicating the sensitivity of these cells to injury. The main response of type II epithelial cells was cell proliferation. The ' This work was supported in part by EPA cooperative agreement CR8 13 I 13 and a contract from Southern California Edison Co.

Interstitial matrix accumulation underwent partial recovery during follow-up periods in air; however, the thickening of the basement membrane did not resolve. Analysis of terminal bronchioles showed that short-term exposure to OJ caused a loss of ciliated cells and differentiation of preciliated and Clara cells. The bronchiolar cell population stabilized on continued exposure; however, chronic exposure resulted in structural changes, suggesting injury to both ciliated and Clara cells. We conclude that chronic exposure to low levels of 0, causes epithelial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar region and bronchiolar epithelial cell injury. Cc' 1992 Academic Press. Inc. Experimental acute exposures of humans to ambient concentrations of ozone (03) that occur in some urban environments causes decrements in pulmonary function and subjective symptoms of cough, pain on deep inspiration, and shortness of breath. Lung functional changes include increases in airway resistance and respiratory rate and decreases in forced expiratory volume at 1 set (FEVl), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity, and tidal volume (Bates et al., 1972; Becket et al., 1985 : Folinsbee et al., 1984 McDonnell et al., 1983) . These observations are consistent with animal studies (Raub et al., 1982; Costa et al., 1983) .",

            "text": "While the toxicity of high levels of O3 is well established, there are few studies which address whether long-term exposures to the levels of O3 that occur in ambient, urban environments cause lung injury. Recent field studies on the effects of subchronic exposures to ambient O3 on respiratory function in active, normal children have revealed 03-related decreases in FVC and FEVl (Lioy et al., 1985; Spektor et al., 1988) . An important question is what the effects of O3 on the lungs of these children will be after a lifetime of breathing O3 polluted air. Studies with repeated human or animal exposure to O3 (Horvath et al., 198 1; Tepper et al., 1989) as well as the study of children in summer camps, have found that the initial decrement in lung function attenuates with succeeding exposures. However, Tepper et al. (1989) , using rats exposed to 0.5 ppm O3 for 5 days (2.25 hr/day), reported epithelial damage and inflammation in the terminal bronchiolar regions that persisted after the functional alterations diminished. The type of bronchiolar lesion reported by Tepper et al. (1989) is similar to those described by a number of previous studies (Castleman et a/., 1980; Fujinaka et al., 1985; Lum et al., 1978) .",

In addition to the progression of tissue and cell injury with long-term exposure, the effect of recovery in clean air was evaluated. Because of the low, realistic levels of O3 involved and the long duration of the study, the results are particularly relevant to the health effects of environmental 03. The proximal alveolar region was the major site of tissue injury. Cells in terminal bronchioles were also affected, but to a lesser degree. A biphasic response was found in the PAR which involved both the epithelial and interstitial compartments. Accumulation of interstitial matrix, primarily collagen and basement membrane, was detected after 78 weeks of exposure. While most cell reactions subsided when the animals were returned to clean air for substantial amounts of time, the changes in basement membrane did not resolve. Not all bronchiolar alveolar junctions in the rat lung were affected equally by the O3 exposure. Modeling of reactive gas uptake predicts -5% of the ventilatory units in the lung have a twofold greater and -5% have a twofold less than average O3 exposure per unit surface area in the PAR (Mercer et al., 199 1) . Our random sampling procedure may lead to undersampling of hot or cold spots. Nevertheless, when sufficient numbers of animals are studied, random sampling provides an accurate estimate of mean tissue responses.",

They include influx of alveolar macrophages, thickening of the type I epithelium, hyperplasia of type II epithelial cells, and increases in the volume of interstitial matrix in the proximal alveolar region. These previous observations on relatively high levels of O3 or on low levels of O3 for relatively short periods of time led to the design of the current study which utilized a low-level chronic exposure to determine whether the tissue changes are progressive and whether they can be reversed after a chronic exposure is stopped. F344 rats were used since it is the standard strain used in chronic studies by the National Cancer Institute and the National Toxicology Program and because they exhibit relatively little lung growth during their adult life, thus providing a stable model for studies of chronic lung injury. It has been suggested that the F-344 rats may be less sensitive to O3 than are other commonly used rat strains (such as Sprague-Dawley or Wistar) and nonhuman primates (Plopper et al.. 199 1; Costa et al., 1992) . If F344 rats are more resistant to O3 than are humans the injury responses found with F344 rats may occur in humans at even lower Orexposure concentrations.",

We noted that the magnitude of the epithelial cell response during the acute phase of the reactions appeared to be associated with the presence or absence of alveolar macrophages. This correlates with reports of epithelial cell injury and proliferation induced by proteases and inflammatory mediators released by macrophages (Hurst and Coffin, 1971; Leslie et al., 1986; Ring et al., 1990) . Alternately, the apparent recovery of epithelial injury after 3 weeks of exposure may be related to increases in epithelial cell antioxidant defenses following the initial exposure (Mustafa and Lee, 1976; Plopper et al., 1979) . Studies of antioxidant enzymes in whole lung homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of another cohort of rats in the same chronic study have shown increases in glutathione-related enzyme activities and/or ascorbate and tocopherol levels at 12 and 18 months of exposure (Jaskot et al., 1989; Norwood et al., 1989) .",

            "text": "The initial exposure caused loss of cilia and changes in Clara cell surface area. That Clara cells displayed a reduction in dome surface after 3 weeks of exposure while ciliated and preciliated cells returned to normal suggests either that ciliated cells adapt to O3 toxicity while Clara cells do not, or that there was continued cell loss and differentiation but the cell population balance was restored. With chronic exposure, a significant loss of cilia on ciliated cells was noted. Ozone-induced cell injury in the terminal bronchioles was reversible upon return to clean air. Figure 7 summarizes the changes that were found after 78 weeks of exposure to a simulated ambient pattern of 03. In the terminal bronchioles, cilia were lost and the size of the domes of Clara cells was reduced. In the proximal alveolar region, epithelium was thickened and deposition of interstitial matrix occurred. An important question is whether or not these structural alterations are likely to result in significant functional impairment. Parallel lung function studies have revealed a significant OX-induced increase in expiratory resistance particularly after 78 weeks of exposure (Tepper ef al., 199 1) . Small but significant decreases in lung volume and enhanced nitrogen washout kinetics were also found (Costa, personal communication) that are consistent with the fibrotic lesions reported herein. Local and systemic immune functions were apparently unaffected by the chronic Oj exposure (Selgrade et al., 1990) . Pinkerton et al. (1989) reported that rats exposed to the same simulated ambient pattern of O3 for 6 weeks followed by a 5-hr exposure to asbestos fibers retained three times as much fibers in their lungs as did control rats exposed only to the asbestos fibers. Warren and Last ( 1987) had demonstrated that exposure to O3 and sulfuric acid aerosol simultaneously produced synergistic effects on the rate of collagen synthesis. The impact of even minor O3 effects should not be underestimated because O3 may interact with other airborne pollutants such as cigarette smoke, silica, and particulates to produce additive or synergistic injuries. It should be noted that human beings are commonly exposed for far longer periods than were the animals in this study, and that the relative sensitivity of humans in comparison to F-344 rats remains uncertain. Tyler et al. ( 1987) found that lung growth and development in young rats exposed to O3 for 42 nights were altered and that these changes persisted after O3 inhalation was stopped. The effects of O3 on lung structure described in this study appear to be adverse and suggest that long-term functional impairment and lung disease could result from inhalation of air polluted with 03.",
