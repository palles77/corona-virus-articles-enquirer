Prodromal, clinical and outcome parameters did not distinguish virus from non-virus illness. PCR was the most sensitive Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as the presence of progressive, incompletely reversible obstructive lung disease from diffuse causes, including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and small airways disease. Some 3-5% of approximately 1000 patients presenting annually with exacerbations of COPD are admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for ventilatory assistance with either bilevel non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) or ventilation via an endotracheal tube (ETT). Despite several studies in the unventilated population [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] , and two studies in ventilated COPD patients [7, 8] , the viral aetiology of many COPD exacerbations remains unclear. Over 200 respiratory viruses [9] have been shown to cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections via inflammatory and neural mediators [10] . Of these, influenza types A and B (Inf A, B), parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3 (Para 1, 2, 3), rhinovirus (RV), adenovirus (AV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV) [11, 12] and, less commonly, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [13] , and enterovirus (EV) [14, 15] have been shown to play significant roles in airway infections.",

In the absence of prior spirometry, we assessed a smoking history of at least 20 pack years, physical examination, review of previous hospital records, chest radiograph changes suggestive of COPD, exclusion of other major co-morbidities as a primary cause of chronic breathlessness and chronic reduction in exercise tolerance to make the diagnosis of COPD. ICU admission for ventilatory support was considered when, despite optimal medical therapy and oxygen administration, there was acidosis (pH < 7.35), hypercapnia (PaCO 2 > 45 mmHg), increasing respiratory distress and/or worsening fatigue or reduced consciousness [16] .",

A subsequent study also examined the outcomes of treatment in one of these initial series [19] . All 50 patients in the Soler study [7] and all 54 in the Fagon study [8] were intubated, facilitating protected brush and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. No bronchoscopic specimen collection was performed on the smaller subset of intubated patients in our study, where 61 patients (57%) received NIV alone, with 17 (16%) receiving both NIV and ETT and only 29 (27%) being intubated without NIV. The collection of appropriate respiratory samples has been complicated by the introduction of NIV as an accepted modality for the treatment of severe COPD exacerbations, as NIV patients may not produce suitable sputum. Fibre-optic bronchoscopy may not be easily tolerated by these patients, in spite of the use of modified face masks [20] . Inducement of sputum specimens with hypertonic saline, although an effective method of sample collection in unintubated patients [21, 22] , may induce or worsen bronchospasm and was not considered a practicable option in our cohort with initial respiratory instability. Bacteria grown from sputum or endotracheal aspirate may not be representative of the pathogenic organism that is causing the exacerbation [23, 24, 25] , with up to half of stable COPD patients colonised by a potential bacterial pathogen [26, 27] . To reduce this possibility, we examined our sputum specimens for the presence of neutrophils and correlated the Gram stain with culture in an effort to determine whether the organism was a commensal or a probable pathogen [18] . Twenty-five (24%) of the 105 patients received antibiotics within the 3 days prior to ICU admission. Of these 25, 3 (12%) had a positive bacterial culture (all H. influenzae). The possibility that recent antibiotic therapy may have reduced the bacterial yield in the other 22 episodes must be considered.",

InfA [6, 36] , RSV [32, 33, 36] , CoV [37] and RV [5, 22, 32, 33] were the most frequently detected viral pathogens in more recent studies of COPD exacerbations. In our study, Inf A, Para 3, RSV and RV were most often detected ( Table 2 ). One study suggests that patients with evidence of virus infection during COPD exacerbations have greater symptom severity at onset than those with non-virus exacerbations, and a significantly longer median time to symptom recovery [32] . We did not find this in our study, with no significant differences in prodromal symptoms, length of ICU and hospital stay or mortality observed between virus and non-virus exacerbations.",

Garbino reports a 10% virus culture positivity from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens in a group of hospitalised patients with LRTIs, whilst reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) identified a virus in 29% of the same specimens [33] . This may be because the presence of only small quantities of virus is not detectable by culture. Most viral pathogens are more difficult to culture after more than 72 h of illness and PCR is able to detect infection for a longer period due to its high sensitivity. PCR is consistently associated with high detection rates in other studies of the COPD exacerbation population, with a 40-64% virus yield [5, 6, 32] . A rising antibody titre over 3 weeks is considered strong evidence for a probable virus or atypical pathogen, but is obviously not possible in deceased patients or those lost to follow-up. Whilst a useful epidemiological tool, it provides a retrospective diagnosis and therefore cannot affect clinical decisions in the critically unwell.",
