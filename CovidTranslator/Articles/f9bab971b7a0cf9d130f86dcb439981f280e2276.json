While most mathematical models for the virulence of infectious diseases focus on the interplay between the dynamics of host populations and the optimal characteristics for the success of the pathogen, our model focuses on how pathogen characteristics may change at the start of an epidemic, before the density of susceptible hosts decline. We envisage animal husbandry situations where hosts are at very high density and epidemics are curtailed before host densities are much reduced. The use of three pathogen characteristics: lethality, transmissibility and mutability allows us to investigate the interplay of these in relation to host density. We provide some numerical illustrations and discuss the effects of the size of the enclosure containing the host population on the encounter rate in our model that plays the key role in determining what pathogen type will eventually prevail. We also present a multistage extension of the model to situations where there are several populations and parasites can be transmitted from one of them to another. We conclude that animal husbandry situations with high stock densities will lead to very rapid increases in virulence, where virulent strains are either more transmissible or favoured by mutation. Further the process is affected by the nature of the farm enclosures.",

            "text": "There is an extensive literature on mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Both the rate of spread and the virulence of pathogens are important, and both the dynamics of disease spread and the evolution of virulence in parasite-host systems have attracted much attention. The first mathematical model of disease dynamics apparently goes back to the 1760 paper by Bernoulli (1760) (see also pp. 2-6 in Daley and Gani 1999) . A major step in further development of deterministic modelling was the \"threshold theorem\" (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) showing that the initial frequency of susceptibles must exceed a certain threshold value to give rise to an epidemic. The first stochastic epidemiological models appeared in the late 1920s (McKendrick 1926) , applying the \"law of mass action\" suggested in Bernoulli (1760) to probabilistic description of the epidemics. Stochastic models became much more popular after Bartlett (1949) formulated a model for the general stochastic epidemic by analogy with the deterministic model from Kermack and McKendrick (1927) . Anderson and May (1982) introduced the first model of evolutionary change in pathogen virulence in 1982, which explained the decline in virulence of myxomatosis, introduced to control Australian rabbits, in terms of optimal transmission of the parasite between hosts. Subsequent work, notably Ewald (1983) , Massad (1987) , Knolle (1989) , Lenski and May (1994) , Gandon et al. (2001) , has expanded on this classic paper, to cover the effects of a vector of the pathogen, vaccination of hosts, and various other issues. For more extensive surveys of the field and literature reviews, we refer the reader to the monographic literature (Anderson and May 1991; Becker 1989; Daley and Gani 1999; Andersson and Britton 2000; Mode and Sleeman 2000) and also to papers (Allen 2008; Dietz and Schenke 1985; Hethcote 1994; Ebert 1999; Day and Proulx 2004) .",

Almost all the models referred to above have considered such natural populations of hosts, where the density of susceptible hosts is reduced by the pathogen. They show that as host density is reduced, less virulent strains of pathogen become more viable, such that infected hosts live longer, and thus tend to pass the pathogen to more susceptible new hosts, maintaining the epidemic. While hosts will have longer generation times than their pathogens, they too, will evolve to be more resistant, further reducing the virulence of the pathogen for these hosts. On this basis one might expect pathogens to be highly virulent only when they have recently switched hosts, such as the SARS coronavirus that was probably transferred to humans from animals such as Himalayan civet cats (Guan et al. 2003) or when the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, has been transferred to humans from rodents (Yersin 1894). Various reasons, such as low host resistance, have been suggested to explain high initial virulence of transferred pathogens (Bolker et al. 2010) .",

Instead, antibiotics are applied, hosts are destroyed, or other measures are used in an attempt to eliminate the pathogen, once it is recognised that a serious pathogen epidemic is spreading. If such pathogens persist, they must do so through resistant stages and some mechanism of transfer to new enclosures of domestic stock or crops, where the initial epidemic stage is repeated. The initial stages of each epidemic will typically occur at very high host density. This is the situation we wish to model.",

In all the cases, the process is supercritical (\u03c3 + > 0) calculation shows, the value of R does not depend on density \u03bb. The last observation we could have actually made earlier, as it follows from the model construction. Figure 3 illustrates the stated exponentially fast convergence of the ratios R i (t) to a common limit R in four situations that have common parameter values \u03b1 1 = 0.5, \u03b1 2 = 1.5, \u03bc 1 = \u03bc 2 = 0.2, \u03b2 1 = 0.3, \u03b2 2 = 0.6, but different encounter rates.

On the top right plot, we see that, for \u03bb = 6, there establishes a rough balance (R \u2248 1.076), whereas on the plots in the second raw we see type 2 parasites to gain dominance pretty fast (which is due to higher values of = \u03c3 + \u2212 \u03c3 \u2212 ), with the limiting values R \u2248 1.500 and 1.699, respectively. The character of the dependence of R on the transmission probabilities is illustrated in Fig. 4 . For four different values of the encounter rate (\u03bb = 2, 6, 10 and 14), the figure shows the plots of R as a function of (\u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 ), restricted to the regions where the process is supercritical (i.e. \u03c3 + > 0).

Figure 5 shows the plots of R as a function of the mutation probabilities (\u03bc 1 , \u03bc 2 ) \u2208 (0, 1) 2 for different encounter rates, all other parameters being fixed and common, with the transmission probability for type 1 being double that for type 2 (\u03b2 1 = 2\u03b2 2 = 0.4). On the left plot corresponding to \u03bb = 4, the maximum value of R barely exceeds 0.5, whereas on the right one, due to the increase in the encounter rate to \u03bb = 7, not only the supercriticality region is much bigger, but also the maximum value is R = 3. We see type 2 parasite's domination in the region where the mutation rate \u03bc 1 (from type 1) is high enough, while \u03bc 2 is relatively small.",

The character of the dependence is illustrated in Fig. 6 showing R as a function of (\u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 ) \u2208 (0, 7) 2 , for \u03bb = 2, 6, 10 and 14. Note how the encounter rate \u03bb influences the size of the region where the process is supercritical (thus, for \u03bb = 2 it shrinks to a narrow strip in the (\u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 )-domain, corresponding to small values of \u03b1 1 ). This is consistent with previous models of virulence evolution-it appears that they all would show that a more virulent pathogen strain would not be competitive if all its other parameters were equal to other strains. The \"trade-off\" relation between virulence and transmission rate in those models is necessary for more virulent pathogens to dominate. The recent model in Day and Gandon (2006) which also does not assume a tradeoff, produces a similar result.",

That is, in this case the rate is proportional to the density of hosts. To summarise the above analysis, we observe that the encounter rate \u03bb = \u03bb(\u03b5) grows rather fast when the linear dimensions (specified by the parameter \u03b5) of the hosts' \"world\" diminish. In the three-dimensional case, \u03bb is inversely proportional to the volume per host, in the two dimensional case it grows slightly faster than the reciprocal of the area per host, while in the one-dimensional case the growth rate of \u03bb is inversely proportional to the square of the size of a host's share of the enclosure. This indicates that not only effective density per se, but also the shape of the enclosure can be an important factor leading to an epidemic. Thus the nature of the enclosures in which animals are kept can be an important factor in determining the progress and nature of an epidemic.",

A possible objection to the above simple aggregate model is that pathogens will not always mutate to become more lethal. The model can be further generalized by allowing, within each enclosure, mutations of our pathogen not only in the direction of higher lethality, but also in the opposite direction. So we will first have to generalize our basic model from Sect. 2 to a three-type branching process, assuming that, if an enclosure is infected with a pathogen with lethality \u03b1, then the pathogen can mutate to ones with lethalities r \u22121 \u03b1 and r \u03b1, respectively, where, as before, r > 1 is a fixed number (all other parameters being assumed equal for the different types of pathogens). Mathematically, analyzing such processes is essentially equivalent to what we did in Sects. 2-4, although all the closed-form expressions will become much more complicated, and so we will not give much technical detail for brevity's sake. The main assertions concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the branching process will remain true: there will exist a limiting balance of types in the supercritical case (denote the shares of the different pathogens by \u03c0 j = \u03c0 j (\u03b1), j = 1, 2, 3, j \u03c0 j = 1), which can be found from the generator A of the semigroup of the mean matrices, and the almost sure convergence of the process scaled by e \u2212\u03c3 + t (as before, \u03c3 + denotes the Perron-Frobenius root of A) to a limiting random vector will hold.",

Thus a high density of animals on farms or mariculture facilities will rapidly lead to the dominance of more lethal strains of pathogens if these can enter the farm and mutations occur to produce more lethal variants. An example of this process has recently been described in the mariculture of fish in Pulkinnen et al. (2010) . The problem has been recognized in intensive poultry production (Slingenbergh and Glibert 2010) , and the identification of more virulent trains of Marek's disease in chickens (Witter 1997 ) may also be an example of this process. It also seems possible that the advent of very virulent strains of Spanish Flu in August 1918 in US military camps, troop ships, and European disembarkation camps, some time after the start of the epidemic may be linked to high densities of soldiers in these camps and troop ships and the difficulty in implementing quarantine in these overcrowded camps (Mathews et al. 2009 ), although there are other plausible explanations, such as overcrowded conditions leading to higher infection doses.",

The effect increases more rapidly with density where an enclosure is most appropriately measured as area (cattle feedlots, paddocks) than if the appropriate measure is a volume (fish tanks). We assumed constant mixing so that the rate of encounter with susceptible hosts is not materially changed in the first stages of the epidemic. These assumptions will limit the situations in which this result may apply to cases where animals mix freely and rapidly in the enclosure, but our result may also apply if there is a large area around an infected individual where others may become infected by a pathogen, because it is dispersed in air, water or over time [as a long-lived propagule (Biggs 1985) that can disperse or survive until restocking (Bull and Ebert 2008) ].",
