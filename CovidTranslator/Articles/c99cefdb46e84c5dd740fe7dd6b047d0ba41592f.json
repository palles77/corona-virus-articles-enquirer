Second, due to the relatively small number of eligible studies, it is not possible to perform subgroup analysis on the type of severity. In addition, most of the literature does not carry out correlation studies on disease severity time and outcome, so corresponding subgroup analysis cannot be performed. This may also affect its accuracy. Third, there are many factors that affect the severity of COVID-19 disease. In addition hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease, it is also related to various factors such as age, other diseases, living environment, economic and health conditions, smoking, viral virulence, and compliance.
