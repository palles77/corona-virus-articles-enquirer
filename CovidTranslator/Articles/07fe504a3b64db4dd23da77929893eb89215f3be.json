The objective of the present study was to determine the frequency and clinical relevance of HBoV infection in adult patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD). Methods: We retrospectively tested 212 COPD patients, 141 (66.5%) with AE-COPD and 71 (33.5%) with stable disease, of whom nasal lavage and induced sputum had been obtained for the presence of HBoV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The specifi city of positive polymerase chain reaction results was confi rmed by sequencing. Results: Two hundred two of 212 patients for whom PCR results were available both for nasal lavage and induced sputum samples were eligible for data analysis. HBoV DNA was detected in three patients (1.5%). Of those, only one patient had AE-COPD. Thus, the frequency of HBoV infection demonstrated to be low in both AE-COPD (0.8%) and stable COPD (2.9%). HBoV was found in two sputum and one nasal lavage sample in different patients, respectively. Sequencing revealed \u03fe99% sequence identity with the reference strain. Conclusion: HBoV detection was infrequent. Since we detected HBoV in both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and in AE-COPD as well as stable disease, a major role of HBoV infection in adults with AE-COPD is unlikely.",

            "text": "Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) account for a signifi cant number of hospitalizations and therefore present an important economic burden in health care. 1 AE-COPD substantially contribute to loss in lung function, disease progression, and mortality. 2 Most patients presenting with AE-COPD describe symptoms of respiratory infection. 3 Historically, bacteria have been considered to be the major cause of infectious exacerbations, but as bacteria are also found in clinically stable patients, the role of bacterial infection remains controversial. 4 With the broad availability of molecular diagnostics like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the prominent contribution of common viral agents of upper respiratory tract infection like human rhinovirus (HRV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to the etiology of AE-COPD has been increasingly recognized. [4] [5] [6] Nevertheless, in about one third of severe exacerbations the cause remains unknown. 1 In recent years novel respiratory viruses including the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and several coronaviruses (SARS, NL63, and HKU1) have been discovered. Their role in AE-COPD has already been defi ned to some extent. 7, 8 Ringshausen et al Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a novel parvovirus initially discovered in 2005 in respiratory secretions of Swedish children with symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection with a frequency of 3.1%. 9 Proving its role as a causative agent of acute respiratory tract infections is challenging as HBoV has not been propagated in cell culture and as animal models have not yet been established. Hence, some of the modifi ed postulates of Koch are not applicable. 10 Numerous retrospective and prospective studies suggested an association between HBoV and acute respiratory tract infections in children. Clinical fi ndings consisted of wheezing episodes, asthma exacerbations, acute obstructive bronchitis, bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Infants below the age of two years and patients with structural pulmonary diseases or immune disorders seem to be predominantly affected. Preliminary evidence is provided that acute HBoV infection may take a viremic course and may also be capable of persistence in the respiratory tract. 16 HBoV infections appear endemic worldwide. 16 First studies on the seroepidemiology give evidence for protection by maternal antibodies within the fi rst months of life. 17 In a Japanese study all of the 204 children examined had immunoglobulin G antibodies to the viral protein 1 (VP1) by the age of 6 years, emphasizing its ubiquitous nature. 18 Taken together, these fi ndings suggest that there is protective immunity after past infection which may explain why HBoV is comparatively rare in adults. 9, [19] [20] [21] [22] Frequencies of HBoV detection in respiratory specimens of children described in the literature vary from 2% to 19%. 11, 23 Recently, a HBoV detection rate of 12% has been described among German children with symptoms of respiratory tract infections. 24 To our knowledge the role of HBoV in a well characterized population of adult patients with AE-COPD has not been systematically studied yet. Implications of a frequent detection in AE-COPD are the introduction in clinical routine testing and a subsequent decrease of antimicrobial overuse. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of HBoV infection in hospitalized patients with AE-COPD and to establish its potential clinical relevance by comparison to patients with stable COPD hospitalized for other reasons than acute exacerbation.",

            "text": "In this retrospective study of a prospectively recruited, case-controlled cohort we found HBoV detection to be infrequent in adult hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation and stable COPD during the years 1999 to 2003 in the urban region of central Ruhr area, Germany. In total, HBoV DNA was detected in three of 202 patients (1.5%) only. It was found both in acute exacerbation (0.8%, 1/134) and stable disease (2.9%, 2/68) as well as induced sputum and nasal lavage samples. These fi ndings suggest that HBoV may not be of clinical relevance in adult patients with AE-COPD and routine testing for HBoV in this population may not be warranted. Data on HBoV infections in adults is limited. 9, 13, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] 30 Screening for respiratory viruses is not generally recommended for adults with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, 1,31 thus material for large-scale retrospective analysis is hardly available. The very low frequency of overall HBoV detection found in our study is in agreement with other studies in adults. The initial investigation by Allander and colleagues did not detect HBoV in 112 adults with respiratory symptoms at all. 9 A large Thai study detected HBoV in 0.7% of subjects (6/834) aged 20 years or older (including 126 controls) only. 13 Two Italian studies found frequencies of 1.2% (1/84 between the years 2000 and 2006) 21 and 1.4% (2/143) 19 in adult patients despite the use of different PCR assays (realtime and single-round PCR, respectively). Notably, a very recent US-American study found the identical frequency of 1.5% in 273 adults. 22 The only previous study explicitly including patients with AE-COPD found HBoV in one of 126 (0.8%) adult patients with AE-COPD or pneumonia, a 71-year-old Canadian male who had received oral steroids for the treatment of his exacerbation. 20 Unfortunately this report covered one winter season (2002/2003) only and neither specifi ed the proportion of AE-COPD patients included nor provided any clinical details on the population. In contrast to the reports mentioned above, which predominantly studied specimens representing the upper respiratory tract (nasal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates), our study investigated both induced sputum and nasal lavage samples. In a previous PCR-based study we demonstrated that AE-COPD requiring hospital admission was significantly associated with the presence of common respiratory viruses. Induced sputum, which may more reliably refl ect the lower respiratory tract, had a higher viral yield than upper respiratory tract specimens in patients with AE-COPD. 25 HRV (36%), infl uenza virus A (25%), and RSV (22%) were most frequently detected, while in a similar study we recently found another emerging respiratory virus, HMPV, to be infrequent in AE-COPD as well (2.3%, 3/130, overall prevalence 1.3%, 3/229). However all of the three HMPV detections occurred in the AE-COPD group, making asymptomatic carriage unlikely. 7 The present study investigated the frequency of HBoV infection in four consecutive years with special care on avoidance of a seasonal selection bias by monthly recruitment of both groups in a 2:1 case-control setup. We used an optimized HBoV PCR assay performing 50 cycles of single-round, hot-start PCR, 29 which was sensitive enough to detect a single HBoV DNA copy per reaction. Sequencing of PCR products revealed a nucleotide identity of \u03fe99% between different samples and years. This fi nding of a limited genetic variation is in agreement with previous reports. 9, 23 In the present study viral coinfections, which were assessed by sensitive PCR assays, were existent in two of three HBoV-positive subjects (although specimens were not evaluated for the presence of some less common respiratory viruses like adenovirus, coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and parainfl uenza viruses 1 and 2). This fi nding is consistent with the hypothesis that HBoV is carried at low copy numbers in some individuals and that its detection is enhanced, or the virus reactivated, by another respiratory infection. 16 Due to the very low detection rate in our study, an analysis of a potential association between HBoV infection and distinct clinical features was not possible. Remarkably, the patient with AE-COPD who tested positive for HBoV suffered from concomitant acute gastroenteritis. HBoV has also been proposed to be a causative pathogen in acute gastroenteritis, but so far its etiologic role remains controversial. 32, 33 Conclusion This is the fi rst controlled study on the prevalence of HBoV in adult hospitalized patients with AE-COPD. We found HBoV at a very low frequency in patients with acute exacerbation as well as stable COPD, comparable to what has been reported in other adult study populations. Thus, a major role of HBoV infection as a common trigger of AE-COPD is unlikely.",
