The outbreak provoked not only fear and stress; but also professional, emotional, ethical, and social conflicts and tension among healthcare providers and patients alike. Therefore, this study aims to explore what healthcare providers, who survived coronavirus infection, have experienced as a MERS patient and how the infection affected their relationship with their colleagues. Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted individually with seven survivors (healthcare providers). Each interview lasted up to 90 min, and the data were analyzed using the thematic analysis technique. Within the participants' rich and illuminating experiences, four themes were identified: caring for others in the defining moments, perceived prejudice behaviours and stigmatization, lived moments of traumatic fear and despair, and denial and underestimation of the seriousness of the disease at the individual and organizational levels. Survivors still suffered as a result of their traumatic experiences, which might negatively influence their performance. As these survivors are vulnerable, it is their organization's responsibility to provide a system that embraces HCPs during and after disastrous events.",

This was known as the Infectious Disease Epidemic Plan (IDEP) [3, 11] . For this particular outbreak the index case was identified on June 21, 2015, and as the number of cases were increased the IDEP was activated. With the widespread of MERS in the emergency room, level three, which is the highest level for the plan, called for the closure of the hospital and evacuated wards were being reassigned to cohort confirmed, exposed and non infected/none exposed patients. This eventually led to the successful control of the outbreak, which was declared over, on October 12, 2015. Research has identified that such outbreaks do not just have organizational implications: outbreaks of severe viruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can provoke fear emotional, ethical and cultural conflicts and tensions for healthcare providers in workplaces and those providing direct patient care to infected patients or those who have survived infection [12, 13] . In such instances, healthcare workers have refused to provide patient care [14] .",

The notion of altruism, which was first coined by Auguste Comte in the 19th century, basically refers to an unselfish act that is undertaken voluntarily and intentionally to promote the welfare of others [20, 21] . There are two types of altruism: normative and autonomous. The former refers to the usual acts of helpfulness regulated by social norms with low risk and low cost to the performer, whereas the latter refers to intentional acts that are undertaken primarily for the benefit of others and often associated with high risk and high cost [20] . Therefore, those participants who always went the extra mile for their patients believed that they caught the virus as a result of their altruism. It seems their eagerness to help their patients led them to either consciously or unconsciously practice poor self-protection and precautions. While fear of the infection, anxiety, panicky responses, and scary stories also negatively influenced the performance of some healthcare providers during the epidemic.",

These survivors, as well as the healthcare providers who were working in the environment where MERS-CoV broke out, are still vulnerable because of their terrifying experiences of constantly anticipating frightening scenarios and the possibility of death. Therefore, they need support and help at the organizational level. In order to reduce their fear and anxiety, an educational campaign must be launched immediately after diagnosing the first case in the hospital. It should focus on the signs and symptoms, transmissibility, personal hygiene and protection, precautionary practices, and help-seeking behaviour. Educating and increasing healthcare providers' awareness will help reduce the incidents of rejection and stigmatization of colleagues who are in contact with MERS-CoV positive patients. It is important that hospitals remain vigilant and proactive when it comes to infection control measures and exhibit a high level of transparency about the nature of the infection with employees.",

Unfortunately, despite these guidelines and plans, the outbreak still occurred due to a failure to adhere to the infection control measures. Therefore, healthcare providers should remain vigilant and take emails, educational material and warnings about MERS-CoV more seriously, and hospital management should ensure that the healthcare providers abide by all infection control plans/measures.",
