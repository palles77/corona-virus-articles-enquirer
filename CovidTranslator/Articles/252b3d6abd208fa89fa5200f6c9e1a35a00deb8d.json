            "text": "The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is required in health care settings to protect health care workers (HCWs). The choice of PPE is dictated by the route of transmission of the putative agent as well as by the clinical situation and may consist of a combination of gloves, gown, eye and/or facial protection (EFP), and mask or N95 respirator. The appropriate PPE items must be selected, and the items must be put on and removed in the correct sequence to minimize the risk of exposure. This principle was illustrated during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 when some HCW infections possibly resulted from the improper use of PPE. 1, 2 Through the use of consistent messages, images, and videos, online training has the potential to instruct HCWs about PPE in a standardized and accessible manner. [3] [4] [5] [6] Studies show that online training courses are as effective as traditional teaching methods. [3] [4] [5] [6] Although PPE use has been researched, 7-12 how well online training imparts this knowledge to HCWs has not been widely evaluated.",

It is likely that although correct selection of PPE was emphasized in HCW training previously, less attention was given to the sequence of removal, thus accounting for the general improvement regardless of experience level. The improvement seen in HH compliance was greater than that reported by other researchers. Harbarth et al 25 reported an average HH compliance of only 34%, and Golan et al 26 reported compliance of only 10% before care and 36% after care. We found average postcourse HH compliance scores of 87% when donning PPE and 68% when doffing PPE. A possible Hawthorne effect cannot be ruled out; however, the initial low scores (despite being observed), followed by the improvement postcourse suggest that the course increased the partic-ipants\u00d5 awareness of the need for HH.
