Subsequently, rapid humanto-human transmission of the disease was confirmed in January 2020, and the etiological agent was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to its genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV discovered in 2003 (4, 5) .

It quantifies the average number of secondary cases generated per case. If the reproduction number is below 1.0, infections occur in isolated clusters as self-limited chains of transmission, and persistence of the disease would require continued undetected importations. On the other hand, reproduction numbers above 1.0 indicate sustained community transmission (18, 26) . Using epidemiological data and mathematical modeling tools, we are monitoring the effective reproduction number, Rt, of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Singapore in real-time, and here we report the evolution of Rt by March 5, 2020. Specifically, we assess the effective reproduction number from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset after adjusting for reporting delays, and we also derive an estimate of the reproduction number based on the characteristics of the clusters of COVID-19 in Singapore.",

However, it is possible to adjust epidemic curves by reporting delays using statistical methods (34). The reporting delay for a case is defined as the time lag in days between the date of onset and date of reporting. Here we adjusted the COVID-19 epidemic curve of local cases by reporting delays using a nonparametric method that employs survival analysis techniques (35-37). The 95% prediction limits are derived according to Lawless et al. (38) . For this analysis, we exclude 6 imported cases and 6 local cases for which dates of symptoms onset are unavailable.",

Estimates of Rt>1 indicate sustained transmission; whereas, Rt <1 implies that the outbreak is slowing down and the incidence trend is declining. Hence, maintaining Rt <1 is required to bring an outbreak under control. Using the reporting delay adjusted incidence curve, we estimate the most recent estimate of Rt for COVID-19 in Singapore. We first characterize daily incidence of local cases using the generalized logistic growth model (GLM) after adjusting for imported cases. This model characterizes the growth profile via three parameters: the growth rate (r), the scaling of the growth parameter (p) and the final epidemic size (K). The GLM can reproduce a range of early growth dynamics, including constant growth (p=0), sub-exponential or polynomial growth (0<p<1), and exponential growth (p=1) (40) . The generation interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 days and a standard deviation of 3.17 days based on refs. (41, 42) . We denote the local incidence at calendar time \" by \" , the raw incidence of imported cases at calendar time \" by \" , and the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval by \" . Then, we can estimate the effective reproduction number by employing the renewal equation (43-45)",

The gamma distribution provided a reasonable fit to the distribution of overall reporting delays and estimated a mean reporting delay at 7.6 days (95% CI: 6.6, 8.5) ( Figure 6 ). We also found that imported cases tend to have shorter mean reporting delays compared to local cases (mean 3.3 vs. 8.5 days, Wilcoxon test, p<0.001), as imported cases tend to be identified more quickly.

This indicates that containment efforts are having a significant impact in Singapore. However, some differences in the reproduction numbers reported for the epidemic in China may result from different methods, differences in data sources, and time periods used to estimate the reproduction number. Similarly, a recent study has shown an average reporting delay of 6.1 days in China (60) which agrees with our mean estimate for cases in Singapore (7.6 days). Moreover, the scaling parameter for growth rate (p) indicates a sub-exponential growth pattern in Singapore, reflecting the effective isolation and control strategies in the region. This is consistent with a sub-exponential growth pattern for Chinese provinces excluding Hubei (p~0.67), as estimated by a recent study (61); whereas, an exponential growth pattern was estimated for Hubei (p~1.0) (61).",

The effective reproduction number peaked with a mean value ~1.0between February 6-12, 2020 and declined thereafter. As of March 5, 2020, our most recent the entire distribution of cluster sizes, we jointly estimated the overall reproduction number R and the dispersion parameter k. Fitting the negative binomial distribution to the cluster data in the empirical distributions of the realizations during the early stages of the outbreak in Singapore, the reproduction number is estimated at 0.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.0) after adjusting for the independent and identically distributed observation probability of 50%. The dispersion parameter is estimated at 0.4 (95% CI: 0.1, Inf.) indicating higher transmission heterogeneity.DiscussionOverall, current estimates of transmission potential in Singapore, based on two different data sources and different methods, suggest that temporary local transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 has occurred in Singapore while our most recent estimate of the effective reproduction number and the overall reproduction number derived from the distribution of cluster sizes are below the epidemic threshold of 1.0. Temporary sustained transmission in early February can be partly attributed to multiple case importations and initiation of local transmission in the region. However, as cases get identified, transmission potential starts to decline after mid-February 2020. While large-scale transmission has not been reported in Singapore, the fact that asymptomatic and subclinical cases are now well documented for COVID-19(49) suggests that our estimates could be underestimated(50). On the other hand, it is not clear if asymptomatic or subclinical cases are as infectious as symptomatic cases. Indeed, we have reported that multiple local cases have yet to be traced to existing transmission chains. Additional data collected during the course of the outbreak will help obtain an improved picture of the transmission dynamics (9). These findings emphasize the need to strengthen public health interventions including active case contact tracing activities in countries with emerging transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that current data suggests that imported cases have contributed little to secondary cases in Singapore, with most of the imported cases dating back to the early phase of the epidemic. However, there are examples such as the Grant Hayatt Singapore cluster and the Yong Thai cluster that were linked to imported sources, and the original sources had left Singapore before these local clusters emerged (30, 51).",
