Safety concerns with the currently available smallpox vaccine indicate a need for research on alternative poxvirus vaccine strategies. Molecular vaccines involving the use of proteins and/or genes and recombinant antibodies are among the strategies under current investigation. The poxvirus L1 protein, encoded by the L1R open reading frame, is the target of neutralizing antibodies and has been successfully used as a component of both protein subunit and DNA vaccines. L1-specific monoclonal antibodies (e.g., mouse monoclonal antibody mAb-7D11, mAb-10F5) with potent neutralizing activity bind L1 in a conformation-specific manner. This suggests that proper folding of the L1 protein used in molecular vaccines will affect the production of neutralizing antibodies and protection. Here, we co-crystallized the Fab fragment of mAb-7D11 with the L1 protein. The crystal structure of the complex between Fab-7D11 and L1 reveals the basis for the conformation-specific binding as recognition of a discontinuous epitope containing two loops that are held together by a disulfide bond. The structure of this important conformational epitope of L1 will contribute to the development of molecular poxvirus vaccines and also provides a novel target for anti-poxvirus drugs. In addition, the sequence and structure of Fab-7D11 will contribute to the development of L1-targeted immunotherapeutics.",

            "text": "L1 is a myristoylated, transmembrane protein found on the surface of the mature virion (MV) form of poxviruses (Ravanello et al., 1993) . It is conserved in all orthopoxviruses and its sequence is almost identical among VACV, Variola virus, and monkeypox virus. Deleting the L1R gene blocks morphogenesis and prevents the formation of infectious virus (Ravanello and Hruby, 1994) . However, L1 may also play a role (direct or indirect) in viral entry into cells because L1-specific monoclonal antibodies (e.g., mouse monoclonal antibodies: 7D11, 10F5, and 2D5) bind the surface of the virions and efficiently neutralize infectivity (Wolffe et al., 1995; Ichihashi and Oie, 1996; Hooper et al., 2000) . These antibodies neutralize infectivity after virion attachment (Ichihashi et al., 1994; Wolffe et al., 1995) ; however, recent reports indicate that the L1 protein is not a component of the viral fusion complex Townsley et al., 2005; Moss, 2006) . L1 contains three disulfide bonds, which are formed by the virus-encoded redox pathway (Senkevich et al., 2002) . Two of the three intramolecular disulphide bonds are essential for production of infectious viral particles (Blouch et al., 2005) . When the bonds in L1 are reduced, the neutralizing antibodies, mAb-7D11, mAb-10F5 and 2D5, cannot recognize L1 (Wolffe et al., 1995; Ichihashi and Oie, 1996) , (Hooper, J.W., Schmaljohn, A.L., unpublished data) . Because L1 is an attractive candidate for potential subunit vaccines and/or immunotherapeutics it is important to understand the nature of the epitopes of L1 that play a crucial role in antibody-mediated protective immunity. In this report, we investigated the nature of the interaction between mAb-7D11 and L1 and the mechanism by which these potent neutralizing antibodies prevent infection. The co-crystal structure of the Fab fragment of 7D11 bound to the L1 protein reveals the basis for the conformation-specific binding as recognition of a discontinuous epitope containing two loops held together by a disulfide bond.",

Purified mAb-7D11, 7D11-F(ab\u2032) 2 , and 7D11-Fab were evaluated for binding on ELISA plates coated with purified VACV (Fig. 1A) . MAb-7D11 and 7D11-F(ab\u2032) 2 bound the purified viral antigen at all concentrations tested. In contrast, 7D11-Fab only bound to purified virions when the Fab concentration was high. We observed similar ELISA results using recombinant L1 purified from E. coli as antigen (Fig. 1B) . Interestingly, when the purified VACV or recombinant L1 was treated with ultraviolet (UV) light, reactivity with mAb-7D11, 7D11-F(ab\u2032) 2 , and 7D11-Fab was lost ( Fig. 1A and 1B) . Thus, 7D11-Fab bound both intact virions and recombinant L1 protein albeit with lower reactivity than bivalent forms of the antibody, and the epitope recognized by this antibody could be disrupted when exposed to UV light.",

As expected, mAb-7D11 efficiently neutralized VACV plaque formation as previously described (Wolffe et al., 1995) . 7D11-F(ab\u2032) 2 fragments were also able to neutralize VACV plaque formation to levels similar to those of the intact immunoglobulin. Even at 0.04 \u03bcg/ml, the lowest concentration tested, 7D11-F(ab\u2032) 2 yielded ~75% neutralization. In contrast, 7D11-Fab required more than 100x greater concentrations of protein to give a similar level of neutralization. At the highest concentration used, 80 \u03bcg/ml, Fab fragments elicited ~75% reduction in plaque number. These findings indicated that bivalency plays a role in the capacity of mAb-7D11 to efficiently neutralize VACV.",

To investigate this, 50 PFU of VACV were adsorbed onto BSC-1 cell monolayers at 4\u00b0C. Since only 50 PFU of VACV were used, we reasoned that the viral particles were not close enough to permit inter-particle interactions and therefore allowed us to determine how much neutralization was due to intra-particle L1 binding. Following adsorption, unbound virus was removed and bound particles were incubated at 4\u00b0C with varying concentrations of either mAb-7D11 or 7D11-Fab. Subsequently, anti-Fab antibodies were added to the monolayers. Plaque formation was analyzed four days post-infection. As predicted, mAb-7D11 efficiently neutralized VACV plaque formation when added post-adsorption (Fig. 2C ). 7D11-Fab alone neutralized virus poorly, and even at the highest concentration tested, only ~50% of virus was inhibited. Cross-linking of the 7D11-Fab fragments bound to adsorbed virus led to a marked increase in virus neutralization, albeit less efficiently than that of mAb-7D11. The neutralizing effect of 7D11-Fab plus anti-Fab antibodies was rapidly lost as the concentration of Fab fragments was reduced, possibly due to the inefficient binding of 7D11-Fab to L1 at 4\u00b0C. That cross-linked 7D11-Fab was capable of neutralizing VACV suggested that a significant portion of the bivalent neutralizing capability of mAb-7D11 is intra-particle L1 binding.",

Four copies of the Fab/L1 complex were present in the crystal asymmetric unit. The 7D11-Fab bound to a surface on L1 formed by four long loops on the side of the molecule opposite the amino and carboxyl termini of L1 and presumably away from the viral membrane. These four loops connect the helices of the helical bundle to the strands of the beta sheets of L1 (Fig. 3A) . The heavy chain of 7D11-Fab comprised most of the recognition site for L1 (Fig.  3B) . A total surface area of 1340 \u00c5 2 was buried in the interface between the heavy chain and L1, in contrast to the 225 \u00c5 2 of buried surface area in the light chain:L1 interaction. The typical range for total surface area buried at the interface between an antigen and both chains of the antibody is 1400-1700 \u00c5 2 (Davies et al., 1990) . Another measure that qualitatively describes the strength of the interaction is the analysis of the interaction surface as given by the shape complementarity statistic (Sc), where a perfect fit yields a score of 1 (Lawrence and Colman, 1993) . The heavy chain:L1 interface gave a Sc of 0.65, which is within the range (0.64-0.68) for antibody:antigen complexes. The light chain:L1 interface only yielded a score of 0.26, indicating poor complementarity with L1.",

The escape mutation was in the L1R gene and resulted in a change in residue 35 from an Asp to an Asn (D35N). Because mAb-7D11 binds to a similar epitope as 2D5, we wanted to determine if a change from an Asp to Asn would disrupt mAb-7D11 binding. COS-7 cells were transfected with either pWRG/TPA-L1R or a plasmid containing the D35N mutation. pWRG/TPA-L1R is a plasmid in which the tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) secretion signal sequence is inserted upstream and in-frame with the L1R open reading frame. The TPA permits L1 to be processed through the endoplasmic reticulum where it can take advantage of the endogenous cellular disulfide bond formation machinery and fold properly. Because the transmembrane region was not removed, the molecule was targeted to the plasma membrane where it could be detected by anti-L1 antibodies (Hooper et al., 2007) . At 48 h post-transfection, the ability of antibodies to bind to surfaceexpressed L1 or L1 D35N was examined by flow cytometry (Fig. 4A ). As indicated by the shift in fluorescence intensity, mAb-7D11 interacted with both L1 and the D35N mutant. In contrast, a second L1-specific mAb with potent neutralizing activity, mAb-10F5, did not efficiently interact with the L1 D35N molecule. Neither mAb-7D11 nor mAb-10F5 interacted with cells transfected with the empty pWRG vector. MAb-7D11 and mAb-10F5 competed for binding to VACV as measured by competition ELISA (Hooper, J.W., Schmaljohn, A.L., unpublished observations). As a control, we used an antibody against the poxvirus A33 protein, mAb-10F10, that did not interact with L1-expressing cells (Fig. 4A ). These observations indicated that mutation of Asp35 to Asn did not disrupt the interaction of all potent neutralizing L1-specific monoclonal antibodies even if they bound the same region of L1 as measured by competition ELISA.",

If Asp35 was changed to Asn, the hydrogen bond with Tyr50 could still occur (Fig. 4B , bottom). The hydrogen bond formed by O\u03b42 of Asp35 with Trp33 could be replaced by a similar hydrogen bond between N\u03b42 of Asn35 and O\u03b42 of an alternative Asn52 rotamer conformation on the heavy chain. The hydrogen bond made by Asn52 of the heavy chain to the carbonyl oxygen of Ala59 in L1 can still be formed by the alternate rotamer (Fig. 4B , bottom). Thus, based on the structure of the complex, we can provide an explanation for the binding of mAb-7D11 to the D35N mutant, while other L1-specific antibodies (2D5 and mAb-10F5) may not accommodate the hydrogen bond with N\u03b42 of Asn35 of the D35N escape mutant.",

            "text": "A panel of six anti-L1 antibodies was recently characterized (Aldaz-Carroll et al., 2005) . Peptide mapping and blocking assays demonstrated that the mAbs bound two different antigenic sites. Two of the antibodies (VMC-4 and VMC-35) bound a conformational epitope and were non-neutralizing. Four of the antibodies (VMC-2, VMC-3, VMC-5, VMC-6) recognized a linear, or pseudolinear, epitope, which includes residues 118-128 of L1 and were neutralizing (Aldaz-Carroll et al., 2005) . In blocking experiments, none of the six mAbs bound to the same conformational epitope recognized by the neutralizing antibodies 7D11, 2D5, and 10F5. MAb-7D11 and mAb-2D5 compete for binding to L1 as measured by BIAcore (Aldaz-Carroll et al., 2005) and mAb-7D11 and mAb-10F5 bind to the same site by competition ELISA. The 7D11:L1 co-crystal structure reveals that there is some overlap between the linear neutralizing epitope that includes residues 118-128 of L1 and the conformational epitope recognized by mAb-7D11. Two residues of loop 3 of L1 (loop 3 is colored purple in Figs. 3C and 4B), Lys125 and Lys127, make van der Waals contacts with mAb-7D11 (Table 3) and are also contained within the linear epitope mapped to antibodies generated by Aldaz-Carroll et al.; however, it is possible that Lys125 and Lys127 do not contribute significantly to mAb-7D11 binding which would allow mAb-7D11 and other antibodies to bind simultaneously. This structure and the previously identified linear epitope suggest that the surface made by the loops at the end of L1 is accessible to antibody and that binding of antibody to this region of L1 interferes with events involved in entry.",

The six antibodies were generated by immunizing mice with the ectodomain of L1 produced in the baculovirus expression system, while mAb-7D11 was generated by vaccinating with infectious virus. The baculovirusexpressed L1 protein was targeted through the endoplasmic reticulum for secretion by the addition of a melittin signal peptide to L1 and appears to be folded correctly as measured by the binding of mAb-7D11 and the presence of three disulfide bonds. Glycosylation, however, is present in the baculovirus-produced protein, unlike the L1 produced in a VACV-infected cell, which does not translocate to the cellular compartments that possess glycosylation machinery. Asn residues 27, 50, and 117 are possible N-linked sites and Asn50 and Asn117 were shown to be glycosylated (Aldaz-Carroll et al., 2005) . A glycan on Asn27 could alter the immunogenicity of this epitope as Asn27 makes van der Waals contacts with the 7D11-Fab (Table 2) . We found that the correct conformation of the 7D11 epitope can be disrupted by UV light. Exposure of VACV-infected cell lysate or purified L1 protein to UV light ablated binding of mAb-7D11 ( Fig. 1 ) or mAb-10F5 (data not shown). UV radiation likely disrupted the critical disulfide bonds required for generating high-affinity neutralizing epitopes as it is well-known that UV light can break disulfide bonds, especially through the photo-excitation of aromatic residues (Neves-Petersen et al., 2006; Vanhooren et al., 2006) . In the past, UV-killed poxvirus vaccines were tested for the capacity to protect (Turner et al., 1970) . In retrospect, our data indicate that UV-inactivated poxvirus antigen lacks an important L1-neutralizing epitope.",

In addition, passive transfer experiments in mice indicate this mAb can elicit protective immunity (Hooper et al., 2002; Lustig et al., 2005) . The mechanism by which mAb-7D11 neutralizes virus remains unknown. Here, we identified the precise region of the poxvirus that mAb-7D11 binds and we demonstrated that bivalent binding enhanced the neutralizing activity of this antibody. The ability of high Fab concentration to neutralize virus suggests that the effect does not absolutely require cross-linking of L1 on the surface of virions. The reduced interaction of 7D11-Fabs with intact VACV (Fig. 1A) and purified L1 (Fig. 1B) suggest that the poor neutralizing capacity of 7D11-Fabs was largely due to avidity. This reduced capacity of Fab to neutralize VACV was reported for L1-specific 10F5-Fab (Schmaljohn et al., 1999) . Our findings are similar to what has been reported with 7-10A, a mAb that interacts with a discontinuous epitope present in the spike protein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995) . In that study, bivalency significantly enhanced neutralization of MHV both in vitro and in vivo; however, Fab fragments could also neutralize virus but to a much lesser extent. The authors concluded that bivalency might enhance neutralization by steric hindrance or by causing a conformational change in the viral protein due to the increased avidity. It is possible that mAb-7D11 functions by sterically hindering the interaction of L1 with viral or cellular molecules or by blocking a conformational change in the virion required for entry. Further studies will be required to identify the critical step in the infection process blocked by mAb-7D11 and other mAbs binding the same epitope on L1. Post-attachment steps that could be targeted by these mAbs include: the triggering of host-cell signaling pathways involved in particle uptake, the activation or function of the viral fusion complex, or the uncoating events required to deliver active viral replication machinery to the cytoplasm.",

Because the wild-type mAb-7D11 light chain does not contribute significantly to binding L1, it may be possible to identify light chain mutations that increase the affinity of mAb-7D11. Although the epitopes of 2D5, mAb-10F5, and mAb-7D11 overlap, there are differences in their binding to the D35N mutant of L1.

Briefly, mAb-7D11 was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in F(ab\u2032) 2 digestion buffer consisting of 20 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5. Concentrated mAb were then incubated overnight with immobilized pepsin at 37\u00b0C with constant agitation. Separation of undigested mAb from F(ab \u2032) 2 was performed on an affinity Pak protein A binding column. To ensure undigested mAb were removed from the F(ab\u2032) 2 preparation, the digested mAb were passed through the column a second time. Recovered F(ab\u2032) 2 was concentrated in a 50 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in 10 mM Tris-Cl buffer. 7D11-Fab fragments were generated using the Immunopure Fab preparation kit (Pierce) according to the recommended protocol. Purified mAb-7D11 was incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C in PBS [pH 10?] containing immobilized papain. Undigested mAb were separated from Fab fragments using a protein A binding column. Fab fragments were run through the column a second time to ensure that intact mAb-7D11 was adsorbed out of the Fab preparation. Fab fragments were concentrated using a 10 MWCO concentrator in 10 mM Tris-Cl buffer.",

L1 is colored by secondary structure with \u03b2 sheets in red, helices in blue, and loops in green. Disulfide bonds are shown in yellow. (B) The heavy chain of 7D11-Fab provides most of the interactions with L1. In the same orientation as in A, the surface diagram is colored by polypeptide chains with the 7D11 heavy chain in orange, the light chain in green, and L1 in blue. The calculated total buried surface area and the shape complementarity statistic between L1 and each of the antibody chains are indicated. Interaction of anti-L1 monoclonal antibodies with mutated L1. (A) COS-7 cells were transfected with pWRG/TPA-L1R (black line), pWRG/TPA-L1R D35N (grey line), or empty pWRG vector (solid grey). Cells were incubated with 1:100 dilutions of mAb-7D11 (anti-L1), mAb-10F5 (anti-L1), or a control antibody mAb-10F10 (anti-A33). A anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500) conjugated to Alexa 488 fluorochrome was added and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. For each sample, 10,000 cells were counted. (B) Hydrogen bonds involved in the binding by the 7D11-Fab to Asp35 of L1 as determined in the crystal structure are shown in blue. The atoms of critical residues are shown as sticks.",

In the structure (upper panel), Asp35 (green) makes hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Trp33 and Tyr50 on the heavy chain (gray). Also shown is the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Ala59 on L1 (blue) and N\u03b42 of Asn52 of the heavy chain (gray). In the lower panel, the predicted binding of mAb-7D11 to the D35N mutant of L1 (Model) is shown. The hydrogen bond between Asn35 of L1 (green) and Tyr50 of the heavy chain would be analogous to the bond made with Asp35. A new hydrogen bond (red) can be formed between Asn35 of L1 and an alternate rotamer of Asn52 of the Fab heavy chain, while maintaining the hydrogen bond (red) between Ala59 of L1 and Asn52 of the heavy chain. The L1:7D11-Fab structure has been rotated 180\u00b0 around the vertical axis relative to its orientation in Fig. 3C . (C) Alignment of the L1 ectodomain sequences from VACV, Variola virus, and monkeypox virus in which residues are shown that differ from the vaccinia virus sequence.
