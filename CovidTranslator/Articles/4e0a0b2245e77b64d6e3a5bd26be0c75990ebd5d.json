Large bowel diarrhea is characterized by frequent urges to defecate (usually greater than three times normal frequency), with each defecation producing small quantities of feces that often contain excessive mucus and sometimes fresh red blood. Urgency, resulting from irritability or inflammation of the distal colon, causes frequent premature expulsions of small quantities of feces that would otherwise be insufficient to trigger the defecation reflex. In addition, lapses in house training (\"accidents\") may be caused by urgency and inability to control urges to defecate. The owner may also notice straining (tenesmus) as the patient remains in a squatting posture for an extended period of time after defecation or makes repeated attempts to defecate within a period of a few minutes.

Amebic invasion of the colonic mucosa and submucosa results in ulceration and signs of bloodymucoid large bowel diarrhea with tenesmus. Diarrhea is usually severe and may simulate other forms of chronic colitis or is manifested as an acute dysentery. Both forms of Entamoeba, the trophozoite and cyst, are infectious for animals. Infection is most likely acquired from ingestion of food or water contaminated with human feces, such as drinking from polluted water sources (freeroaming animals) or toilets (house pets). The diagnosis is based on identification of ameboid trophozoites with pseudopodial movement in saline smears of fresh diarrheic feces, amebiccysts in zinc sulfate flotation of formed feces, or trophozoites in colon biopsy specimens. Amebic colitis responds to metronidazole (12 to 15 mg/lb orally two times a day for 5 to 10 days) or furazolidone (1 mg/lb orally three times a day for 7 days). Balantidiasis B. coli, a ciliated protozoan that primarily infects swine, is a rare cause of chronic ulcerative colitis in dogs. Rural dogs in contact with swine feces are most at risk for the disease. Humans can also be infected. Dogs with balantidiasis are usually coinfected with whipworms, and thus it has been suggested that whipworm-induced damage to the colonic mucosa may be a predisposing factor. The diagnosis is based on identification of extremely large (40-80 \u00d7 25-45 \u03bcm), oval, brown, rapidly swimming ciliated trophozoites with prominent macronuclei in saline smears of fresh feces or on identification of protozoal cysts in zinc sulfate or sedimentation preparations of feces.As with Entamoeba and Giardia, the trophozoite stage of Balantidium can be seen in diarrheic feces, whereas cysts are more likely to be found in formed feces.

However, antibi-otics are indicated whenever Salmonella invasion becomes severe or complicated by bacteremia and endotoxemia, as indicated by signs such as shock, dehydration, high fever or hypothermia, and extreme depression, or by laboratory findings such as azotemia, electrolyte imbalances, neutropenia, hypoglycemia, hypoproteinemia, or coagulopathy. Peracute onset and severe hematochezia also may be indications of impending systemic invasion and should prompt antibiotic therapy. The choice of an antibiotic may be based on culture and sensitivity, although most isolates are susceptible to enrofloxacin (Baytril, 2.5 mg/lb two times a day) or trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (7 mg/lb two times a day). Fluoroquinolones such as enrofloxacin can be effective for treating both active disease and the carrier state.

Commercial fiber-containing diets or regular diets supplemented with psyllium (Metamucil; dogs: 1 to 2 tbsp/day) may help to reduce bacterial proliferation and sporulation because fiber is fermented to SCFAs that acidify bowel contents. Alkaline rather than acid conditions are most favorable for C. perfringens. In addition, SCFAs nourish colonic epithelium and protect against injury.",

Clinical improvement using this dosage should be noted within 1 to 2 weeks. After 2 weeks of remission, the dosage is tapered in 2to 4-week increments to the lowest effective alternate-day dosage. In cats that are too difficult to medicate orally, periodic injections of methylprednisolone acetate (20 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously every 2 to 4 weeks) may be substituted for oral treatment, or dermal preparations formulated by a compounding pharmacist may be applied topically. Corticosteroid therapy may be discontinued on a trial basis after 6 to 12 weeks of remission; however, continuous alternate-day therapy is often required to prevent relapse. In refractory cases metronidazole or mesalamine (see following sections) should be added to the prednisolone regimen.

Supplement dietary fiber in the form of psyllium (Metamucil, 1 to 3 tbsp/day in the food), unprocessed wheat bran (1 to 5 tbsp/day), or a commercial high-fiber diet. Fiber-enriched diets can have a normalizing effect on colonic myoelectrical activity, thereby improving functional diarrhea in some dogs. If dietary fiber supplementation is unsuccessful, episodes of diarrhea can usually be controlled with a brief period of fasting and an opioid antidiarrheal drug such as loperamide (Imodium; dogs: 0.05 to 0.1 mg/lb orally every 8 to 12 hours; cats: 0.05 to 0.15 mg/lb orally every 24 hours). Once an episode has abated, loperamide can be discontinued and remission maintained by dietary and stress management. Stress management may require consultation from an animal behavior expert. Sedative and psychotropic drugs are used to produce anxiety relief and light sedation during stressful times. Standard dosages of benzodiazepines, acepromazine, chlorpromazine, or phenobarbital may be helpful in excessively nervous or excitable patients. Amitriptylin (Elavil, 0.5 to 1 mg/lb orally every 12 hours) has been highly effective in treating some dogs with IBS.

Beneficial effects include increased fecal water content, increased fecal weight and frequency, softer fecal consistency, decreased intestinal transit time, and reduction of the intracolonic pressure required for normal defecation. Adequate water intake and patient hydration are required for these beneficial actions and to prevent impaction of fiber in the colon. For long-term control of constipation, a commercially prepared high-fiber diet can be fed, or the regular diet can be supplemented with unprocessed wheat bran, oat bran, or pumpkin (1 to 5 tbsp per meal) or commercial sources of psyllium (Metamucil or Fiberall, 1 to 5 tsp per meal).

Examination of the perianal area establishes the diagnosis. The fistulas usually first appear as small draining puncture holes in the perianal skin with inflammation and hyperpigmentation of the surrounding skin. These small tracts then enlarge and coalesce to form large, interconnecting fistulas and areas of ulceration and granulation CHAPTER 8",

Numerous surgical techniques have been advocated, including varying degrees of excision and debridement of diseased tissue, chemical cautery and electrocautery, and cryosurgery. It is advisable to tailor the aggressiveness of the technique to the extensiveness of the lesions and to preserve as much normal tissue and anal function as possible. Postoperative complications such as fecal incontinence, anal stenosis, and recurrence of the lesions can lead to an unacceptable outcome. Recent studies have shown that medical therapy using cyclosporine (Sandimmune, 0.8 mg to 1.4 mg/lb orally every 12 hours) produces a high rate of healing within 16 weeks, although the recurrence rate is 40%, necessitating additional treatment or surgery. In general, early diagnosis and medical or surgical intervention allows a less radical excision than is required in advanced disease, which in turn means less risk of postoperative complications and a better prognosis.",

It occurs most often in long-haired breeds of dogs and cats, especially during bouts of diarrhea. The anal obstruction leads to anal irritation, inability to pass feces, and constipation. The patient is usually restless and attempts to bite or lick at the anal region. The owner may complain of an unexplained foul odor from the patient. In addition, the matted hair often results in an underlying dermatitis and in warm weather attracts flies that may produce a maggot infestation (myiasis) of the anal area. Examination of the anal region is sufficient for diagnosis. For treatment the hair mats are clipped away and the underlying irritated skin is cleansed and treated topically. Once the obstructing hair mats are removed, defecation should occur normally; however, if the patient has severe colonic impaction of feces, measures to evacuate the colon, as discussed in the Constipation and Dyschezia section may be required.",

Eosinophilic granuloma complex of cats also may involve the perianal region.

These androgen-dependent tumors occur most often in older intact male dogs, and they usually appear as small, firm, well-circumscribed nodules in the skin surrounding the anus. Perianal gland adenomas may be incidental findings unassociated with clinical signs or they may cause anal irritation with scooting and licking at the anal area. In addition, they sometimes ulcerate and periodically bleed. The treatment of choice is excisional or cryosurgical removal and adjunctive castration because of their hormone dependency. Castration alone can produce regression of these tumors; however, excisional biopsy at the time of castration is the only way to rule out malignancy. Estrogens also are inhibitory for perianal gland adenomas; however, they cannot be recommended for prolonged use because of their myelotoxic effects.

Perianal gland adenocarcinomas occur most often in older male dogs and may resemble an ulcerated perianal gland adenoma, except they are locally invasive and may cause diffuse thickening of surrounding tissues. They eventually metastasize to regional lymph nodes (sublumbar) and beyond. Their appearance can also be confused with a perianal fistula lesion or a ruptured anal sac. Apocrine gland adenocarcinomas arise in the anal sac and most often affect older spayed female dogs. They are unique in that they can be an ectopic source of parathyroid hormone-like protein; thus even very small apocrine adenocarcinoma nodules often produce a hypercalcemia of malignancy syndrome with polyuria and polydipsia. Other malignant tumors of the anal region include squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and mast cell neoplasia.",
