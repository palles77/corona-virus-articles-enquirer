However, diagnostic tools other than polymerase chain reaction for PDCoV detection were lacking and Koch's postulates had not been fulfilled to confirm the pathogenic potential of PDCoV. In the present study, PDCoV peptide-specific rabbit antisera were developed and used in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays to assist PDCoV diagnostics. The pathogenicity and pathogenesis of PDCoV was investigated following orogastric inoculation of 5-day-old piglets with a plaque-purified PDCoV cell culture isolate (3 \u00c2 10 4 TCID 50 per pig). The PDCoV-inoculated piglets developed mild to moderate diarrhea, shed increasing amount of virus in rectal swabs from 2 to 7 days post inoculation, and developed macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestines with viral antigen confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining. This study experimentally confirmed PDCoV pathogenicity and characterized PDCoV pathogenesis in neonatal piglets.",

The traditional group 1, 2, and 3 coronaviruses have been replaced with three genera designated Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively. In recent years, a group of novel coronaviruses was identified in Asian leopard cats and some avian species (Dong et al., 2007; Woo et al., 2009) and they were proposed to represent a new coronavirus genus, i.e. the fourth genus Deltacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2010) . During a molecular surveillance study conducted by a Hong Kong group, additional deltacoronaviruses were identified in avian and mammalian species including two porcine CoVs detected in pig samples collected in 2009 (Woo et al., 2012) . Hereby, five coronaviruses have been identified in pigs: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) in the genus Alphacoronavirus; porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in the genus Betacoronavirus; and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in the genus Deltacoronavirus.",

PDCoV has also recently been detected in South Korea (Lee and Lee, 2014) . It remains unclear when PDCoV was introduced into the US, but a recent PCR-based retrospective evaluation of diagnostic samples revealed that PDCoV could be detected as early as August 2013 in pig samples from the US (Sinha et al., unpublished data). The US PDCoV sequences determined thus far share high nucleotide identity ( Z99.8%), with 98.9-99.2% nucleotide identity to the Hong Kong strains, and 99.6-99.8% nucleotide identity to the Korean strain, at the whole genome level (Lee and Lee, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Marthaler et al., 2014a Marthaler et al., , 2014b Wanget al., 2014a Wanget al., , 2014b Woo et al., 2012) . The genome organization and arrangement of PDCoV are in the order of: 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) , open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS 6), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 7 (NS 7), and 3 0 UTR Woo et al., 2012) .",

Although PDCoV has been detected in swine samples, its clinical significance as an etiological pathogen has not been experimentally confirmed in pigs. In this paper, the development of PDCoV peptide-specific rabbit antisera and the use of these antisera in immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry assays for PDCoV detection are described. Additionally, 5-dayold piglets were experimentally inoculated with a plaque-purified US PDCoV cell culture isolate to characterize the pathogenicity and pathogenesis of this virus.",

The first two approaches could take longer time to obtain the desired antibody reagents. In contrast, it is easier to synthesize peptides and generate peptide-specific antibody in less time. In this study, we took the latter approach to generate PDCoV M-, N-, and S-peptide-specific antisera in rabbits. As early as 28 days post immunization, PDCoV M-peptide-specific and S-peptide-specific rabbit antisera with high antibody titers were obtained and the antibody titers remained through 90 days post primary immunization. However, the sera generated from one of the two rabbits immunized with the PDCoV M-peptide or the PDCoV S-peptide, and the sera from two rabbits immunized with the PDCoV N peptide were negative by IFA in PDCoV-infected cells. Interestingly, all of the rabbit antisera contained high concentrations of antibodies against the corresponding target peptides when evaluated in an ELISA using the synthetic peptides as coating antigens (data not shown). This suggests that anti-peptide antibodies generated in some rabbits may not recognize and react with the natively expressed virus proteins. The PDCoV M-peptide rabbit antiserum was used for further evaluation and it specifically reacted to PDCoV but not to other porcine coronaviruses such as PEDV, TGEV, and PRCV. The PDCoV-specific immunofluorescence assay and IHC assay developed in this study provide additional tools to confirm virus isolation results, to determine virus distribution and cellular localization in tissues, and to facilitate study on PDCoV pathogenesis.",

Clinical materials positive for PDCoV by PCR are not ideal to evaluate viral pathogenicity because, although the clinical materials can be proved negative for the common enteric pathogens such as PEDV, TGEV, rotavirus etc., there is no absolute certainty that they do not contain other unknown pathogens. In contrast, plaque-purified cell culture isolate of PDCoV can be utilized to more precisely investigate PDCoV pathogenicity and clinical outcomes. Ideally, the pathogenicity and pathogenesis of PDCoV should be examined in pigs at different production stages (e.g. gilts, sows, weaned pigs, and neonatal pigs etc.). In the present study, 5-day-old neonatal pigs were chosen as the first step of these investigations because it is generally recognized that neonatal pigs are more sensitive than pigs at other production stages to infection with the swine enteric coronaviruses PEDV and TGEV.",

One-day old CDCD piglets inoculated with a Korean strain or two American strains of TGEV (2 \u00c2 10 6.5 TCID 50 ) developed diarrhea at 24-36 hpi (Kim and Chae, 2002) . Even in 5-day-old na\u00efve neonatal piglets, the same pig model as used in the present study, three US virulent PEDV isolates caused severe diarrhea after 24 hpi and 100% of piglets shed virus in rectal swabs at 24 hpi (Chen et al., unpublished data) . Gross lesions consistent with virus infection were observed in the small intestines, ceca and colons of some PDCoV-inoculated pigs at both 4 and 7 DPI; however, histopathological lesions were only observed in small intestines. Pigs necropsied at 4 and 7 DPI tested negative for other enteric viral pathogens such as PEDV, TGEV, and porcine rotaviruses (groups A, B and C) and negative for enteric bacterial pathogens hemolytic E. coli and Salmonella. Although PRRSV and PCV2 are mainly respiratory rather than enteric pathogens, they can cause lethargy and occasional diarrhea. Pigs necropsied at 4 and 7 DPI were tested for PRRSV and PCV2 by virus-specific PCRs and were negative. These data indicate that the observed gross lesions and histopathological lesions in PDCoV-inoculated pigs were not due to concurrent infections with other known pathogens. Histopathological lesions and IHC staining were mainly observed in the middle and distal jejunum and ileum of the PDCoV-inoculated pigs, suggesting that middle and distal jejunum and ileum are better intestinal segments than duodenum and proximal jejunum for microscopic and IHC evaluations. This information is useful for choosing appropriate tissues for PDCoV diagnostic investigations. In this study, PDCoV viral antigen was detected by IHC in the villous epithelial cells of small intestines but was not detected in cecum, colon or other examined tissues. In contrast, PEDV viral antigen could be detected in mesenteric lymph node and some percentage of colon and spleen tissues (Jung et al., 2014; Madson et al., 2015) .",

Relatively high levels PDCoV RNA were detected in cecum, colon, mesenteric lymph node and stomach. However, the significance of these findings is unclear as no microscopic lesions or IHC staining was observed in these tissues. It is well known that IHC has lower analytical sensitivity than PCR and this may be one potential explanation for this difference in detection. Another possibility is that PDCoV RNA was present in gastric or fecal content that was included into the tissue homogenate during tissue processing for PCR but was not present within the actual tissue. Low levels of PDCoV RNA were detected in other tissues including tonsil, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, skeletal muscle, and diaphragm, yet the significance of these findings is unknown and it is unsure if this was due to effect of viremia.",

The pathogenic potential of PDCoV was confirmed as naive pigs developed mild to moderate diarrhea, shed virus in rectal swabs, and developed macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestines with viral antigen confirmed within lesions by IHC staining. However, under the condition of this report, the outcomes of PDCoV infection appear to be less severe than those caused by virulent PEDV and TGEV infections. The susceptibility of pigs at different stages of production to PDCoV infection, effect of virus administration dose, the duration of virus shedding, and the immune responses induced by PDCoV infection warrant further investigations.",

Five ml of each template was used in PCR setup in a 25 ml total reaction using Path-ID\u2122 Multiplex One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and primers (forward primer 5 0 -CGACCACATGGCTC-CAATTC-3 0 , reverse primer 5 0 -CAGCTCTTGCCCATGTAGCTT-3 0 ) and probe (5 0 -CACACCAGTCGTTAAGCATGGCAAG C-3 0 ). The probe was labeled using the FAM/ZEN/3 0 Iowa Black detector (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). The RT-PCR was run on an ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with the following conditions: 1 cycle of 48 1C for 10 min, 1 cycle of 95 1C for 10 min, and 45 cycles of 95 1C for 15 s and 60 1C for 45 s. A PDCoV isolate with known infectivity titer was 10-fold serially diluted for generating a standard curve in each PCR plate. Virus concentration (TCID 50 /ml) in tested samples was calculated based on the standard curve. The mean cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated based on PCR positive samples, and the mean virus titers were calculated based on all pigs within the group.",

Non-enteric tissues were evaluated for evidence of inflammation. Three representative villi and crypts with integrated longitudinal sections were randomly selected from each H&E stained duodenum, proximal jejunum, middle jejunum, distal jejunum, and ileum; villus heights and crypt depths were measured blindly by a veterinary pathologist using a computerized image system as previously described for PEDV . Villus-heights-to-crypt-depth ratio of each tissue was the quotient of the average villus length divided by the average crypt depth.",

Slides were deparaffinized using the Leica Bond Deparaffinization Solution (AR9222, Leica Biosystems), rinsed and treated with the Leica Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution High pH (AR9640, Leica Biosystems) at 97 1C for 20 min. Approximately 150 ml of PDCoV M-peptide rabbit antiserum primary antibody, diluted 1:700, was applied to each slide for 15 min. Slides were rinsed with the Leica Bond Wash Solution (AR9590, Leica Biosystems) prior to applying 150 ml of 3.0% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Slides were then rinsed with the Leica Bond Wash Solution and the Leica Bond Polymer Refine Detection System (DS9800, Leica Biosystems) was applied according to the Leica protocol. Slides were rinsed with the Leica Bond Wash Solution, distilled water, and treated with diaminobenzidine (DAB) for approximately 10 min. Finally, slides were rinsed with distilled water, Leica Bond Wash Solution prior to hematoxylin counterstain for approximately 7 min. Slides were then dehydrated, cleared with xylene and cover slipped. The IHC antigen detection was semiquantitatively scored based on the percentage of villous enterocytes within the section showing positive staining signal with the following criteria: 0 \u00bcno staining; 1 \u00bcapproximately 1-10% enterocytes with positive staining; 2 \u00bcapproximately 10-25% enterocytes with positive staining; 3 \u00bcapproximately 25-50% enterocytes with positive staining; 4\u00bc approximately 50-100% enterocytes with positive staining.
