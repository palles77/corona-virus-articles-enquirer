However, many influenza virus strains have developed resistance to amantadine and rimantadine. 2 Finally, amantadine, rimantadine and related polycyclic amines possess trypanocidal properties (Fig. 1) . 3 Considering the interesting pharmacological profile of amantadine, rimantadine and memantine, these compounds are ideal leads in the development of new agents to treat excitotoxic NMDAR channel mediated neurodegenerative diseases, influenza infections or African trypanosomiasis.",

So far, we have synthesized ring-contracted analogs of these drugs and found that they showed NMDA receptor antagonism, many of them being more potent than amantadine but less potent than memantine. 4 Moreover, several of these compounds displayed an anti-influenza activity very similar to that of amantadine. 5 We also found that oxapolycyclic amines such as 3-alkyl(2-oxadamantyl)-1-amines and 1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydro-1,5:3,7-dimethano-4-benzoxonin-3-amines of general structures 1 and 2, respectively, were also active as NMDA receptor antagonists. While these compounds lacked anti-influenza activity, several of them displayed trypanocidal activity (Fig. 2) . 6 Although several 1,2,3,5,6,7-hexahydro-1,5:3,7-dimethano-4benzoxonin-3-amines, 2, displayed low micromolar activity as NMDA receptor antagonists, the presence of an hemiaminal subunit in these compounds may raise serious concerns about their stability and thus of their further development as therapeutical agents. In fact, it is known that NGP1-01, a micromolar NMDA receptor antagonist containing an hemiaminal unit, 7 decomposes easily in aqueous medium. In this Letter we wish to report the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of several benzopolycyclic amines derived from 3 (Fig. 2) . Several of these derivatives, that are devoid of the hemiaminal unit, show low micromolar NMDA receptor antagonist activity, although with higher IC 50 than the previously described oxa-analogues. Interestingly, several of the new derivatives are endowed with low micromolar trypanocidal activity while only one compound has anti-influenza activity.",

Briefly, reductive alkylation of 3 with benzaldehyde and NaBH 3 CN led to 6 in 59% while reductive alkylation of 3 and 6 with formaldehyde and NaBH 3 CN furnished 7 and 11 in 55% and 75% yield, respectively. Hydrogenolysis of amine 7 led to secondary amine 8 in 74% yield. Alternatively, 8 was obtained by reaction of 3 with methyl chloroformate followed by LiAlH 4 -mediated reduction of the intermediate carbamate, in 28% overall yield. Alkylation of 3 with propargyl bromide led to a mixture of 9 and 10 that were separated by column chromatography. Finally, alkylation of 3 with 1,5-dibromopentane gave the piperidine derivative 12 in 35% yield (Scheme 1).",

In fact, amine 3 (IC 50 = 13.6 lM) is much more potent than the previously described amine 2 (R 1 @R 2 @H, R 3 @CH 3 ; IC 50 = 98 lM). However, this trend is not general, and, for example, amine 11 is 3 times less potent (IC 50 = 12 lM) than tertiary amine 2 (R 1 @R 2 @R 3 @CH 3 ; IC 50 = 4 lM).",

It is well-known that the target of amantadine and rimantadine is the influenza A virus M2 channel protein and that a single S31N mutation in M2 renders the virus resistant to both drugs. 2, 14 As most of the currently circulating subtypes of influenza A virus, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1, carry the S31N mutation in M2, there is an urgent need for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs that are effective against the most common amantadine-resistant mutants. 15 The influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 strain used for testing the activity of amine 6 has an M2 channel carrying two substituions associated with amantadine resistance, that is S31N and V27T. In order to assess if the target of 6 was the M2 protein, the inhibitory activity of 6 was tested on A/M2 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamps (TEV) technique. Amine 6, at 100 lM, was unable to inhibit the activity of the wild-type (amantadine-sensitive) and the S31N and the V27A (amantadine-resistant) mutants, thus suggesting that 6 interacts with a different target in the virus.
