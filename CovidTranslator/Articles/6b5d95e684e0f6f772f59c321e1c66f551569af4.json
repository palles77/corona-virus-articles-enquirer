Viable LSC candidates were isolated by FACS through staining with two specific cell surface markers (CD54 and CD157), propidium iodide, and the CD45 antibody to exclude hematopoietic lineage cells. Flow cytometric analysis with CD31 and its isotype control showed that the sorted CD45 \u2212 CD54 + CD157 + cells did not express CD31 (Supplementary Fig. S1a ).

The expression profiles of these cells include CD45 \u2212 , CD31 \u2212 , EpCAM + , \u03b16-integrin + , \u03b24-integrin + , and CD24 low . To compare the expression pattern of the markers in the sorted CD45 \u2212 CD54 + CD157 + cells with those reported in literature, multi-color FACS analysis was performed using EpCAM, \u03b16-integrin, and CD24. Only few CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + cells were found to express these three epithelial markers (Supplementary Fig. S2) . The result suggests that the CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + cells presently isolated from the neonatal mice markedly differ from the candidate LSC cohorts identified in adult mice. How these CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + cells are related to the LSC cohorts described by others 2-5 is unclear and requires further investigation.",

Schematic diagram of the experimental setup, modified from the FLIM system on the Leica SP5 inverted microscope. The modifications were made by coupling an external laser, i.e. a frequency-doubled picosecond Nd:YAG laser (532-nm wavelength, 7-ps pulse width, and 50-MHz repetition rate), into the microscope through a single-mode optical fiber for the excitation of FNDs.
