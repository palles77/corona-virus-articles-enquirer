Without effective therapeutics or vaccines being available, effective hygiene 14 measure are of utmost importance to prevent viral spreading. It is therefore crucial to 15 evaluate current infection control strategies against SARS-CoV-2. We show the 16 inactivation of the novel coronavirus for the first time and endorse the importance of 17 disinfectant-based hand hygiene to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 18 19 Introduction 20 SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic human CoV to have crossed the species 21 barrier into humans during the last 20 years 1,2,3 . SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated 22 with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is characterized by severe 23 respiratory distress, fever and cough, leading to a high percentage of fatalities, 24",

Alcohol constitutes the 19 basis for many hand rubs routinely used in health care settings. Our findings are 20 therefore of utmost importance in the current outbreak situation to minimize (v/v).

In 11 addition, ethanol (CAS 64-17-5), and 2-propanol (CAS 67-63-0) were investigated. 12 Quantitative Suspension Test and Virus Titration 13 Virucidal activity studies were performed with a quantitative suspension test with 30 14 seconds exposure time 3 . Briefly, one part virus suspension was mixed with one part 15 organic load (0.3 % bovine serum albumin [BSA] as interfering substance) and eight 16 parts disinfection solution of different concentrations. Following 30 seconds exposure, 17 samples were serially diluted and the TCID 50 /mL values were determined by crystal 18 violet staining and subsequent scoring the amounts of wells displaying cytopathic 19 effects. TCID 50 is calculated by the Spearman & K\u00e4rber algorithm as described 9 . 20 Cytotoxic effects of disinfectants were monitored by crystal violet staining and optical 21 analysis for altered density and morphology of the cellular monolayer in the absence of 22 virus and were quantified analogous to the TCID 50 /mL of the virus infectivity.",
