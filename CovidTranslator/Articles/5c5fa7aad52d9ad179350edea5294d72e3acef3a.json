On April 23, the WHO advised against all but essential travel to Toronto, noting that a small number of people from Toronto appeared to have \"exported\" SARS to other parts of the world. The WHO advisory was followed immediately by similar advisories by several governments to their citizens. These warnings had substantial nonhealth consequences for much of Toronto, but the hospitality industry was hit especially hard by the resulting loss of tourism.

According to Toronto's Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union-Local 75, one third of workers in the industry lost their jobs. Others were working reduced shifts. Many displaced workers were not receiving unemployment benef\u0131ts. In response, Toronto 2-1-1 formed public-private partnerships with members of the retail and hotel sectors, as well as labor unions, education and employment centers, food pantries and social service agencies to centralize support for displaced hospitality workers. Toronto 2-1-1 provided an accessible information line for people who needed to access these services, and helped establish HospitalityWorks.ca, an online partner site to 211Toronto.ca. 4 The information and referral specialists who work at 2-1-1 services are trained to probe beyond a caller's presenting issue to identify deeper surrounding concerns, and they specialize in referrals to social services in the local community. Thus, they were well suited to help the hospitality workers in the most eff\u0131cient way possible. Although a worker might have called because she lost her job, Toronto 2-1-1's holistic approach would uncover the myriad consequences of unemployment for her and her family, and in a single call connect the worker to as many needed resources as possible.",

The 2-1-1 system's inthe-moment crisis information included updates on Red Cross needs, donation needs and drop-off sites, gathering centers, alternative shelters, and aggregated information about the latest availability and location of services that often can change from hour to hour during crises. The Ontario 2-1-1 system shares an aggregated, unif\u0131ed, and constantly updated database that all 2-1-1 operators as well as the public can access on the Internet. Updated information on emergent or ephemeral situations such as regional forest f\u0131res or local flood-service response is shared among the operators, particularly with Toronto 2-1-1, which provides after-hours service. Toronto 2-1-1 also has partnered with Toronto Public Health to disseminate timely citywide heat alerts during the summer's hottest days and shares data with Toronto Social Development to analyze and better understand social and community needs and resources.",

In 2010 -2011, funding was secured to purchase and install a rooftop gas-powered generator linked to the gas utility at Toronto 2-1-1. To bridge the time gap between power failure and generator start-up, battery back-up for critical equipment also was purchased and installed. In 2012, a joint Business Continuity Plan is being developed that will enable 2-1-1s in the province to back each other up as well as support processes in the event of an emergency. A similar cooperative relationship is already in place, with Toronto 2-1-1 providing after-hours bilingual (English and French) information and referral for six other 2-1-1s across the province.",

It also illustrates how 2-1-1s can adapt on the fly to unique circumstances of unexpected events, and quickly establish community partnerships to address emerging issues. Finally, learning from these experiences to improve future service is critical. It is a hope that sharing this information with other 2-1-1 systems and the communities they serve will generate more useful ideas and practical solutions for the times ahead when facing similar events.",
