            "text": "Respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in low-or middle-income countries (LMICs) and account for an estimated four million deaths annually [1] . Before the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, much research focused on influenza, which causes worldwide annual epidemics of seasonal resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and approximately 250,000 to 500,000 deaths [2] . In the US, influenza causes on average of 226,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 to 49, 000 deaths each year [3, 4] . Control of influenza in children is an acute public health problem because attack rates (i.e., the proportion of the population infected) in unvaccinated children are estimated to average 12.7% [5] and exceed 30% during pandemic years [6] . Children also amplify the outbreak as they infect their peers and families, creating greater opportunities for further transmission in the community. [7, 8] For rapidly emerging outbreaks such as novel strains of influenza or SARS-CoV-2, pharmaceutical measures may be unavailable or less effective, and non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs) need to be used [9, 10] . NPIs are divided by the World Health Organization into categories of personal protection, social distancing, travel and environment measures [11] . However, when the WHO systematically reviewed all studies supporting each NPI for controlling pandemic influenza, it found gaps in the evidence base for many of the measures [11] . In this study, our goal is to use a computational model to examine the policy of symptom-based isolation -a form of social distancing. Under this NPI, individuals who are showing fever due to a respiratory infection are required to remain in isolation until their symptoms subside, normally followed by an additional period of one day free of fever (or antipyretic medications or steroids). The CDC currently recommends this NPI for controlling pandemic influenza and controlling influenza in schools [12, 13] . The buffer period of 1 day helps reduce transmission by keeping people in isolation when their fever symptoms temporarily subside. It also prevents transmission from viral shedding that often continues past the last episode of fever [14] . This NPI is often referred to as fever absenteeism or return-to-school policy in the context of schools.",

The benefit of using a model is the ability to clarify and quantify the possible effects of many different policy choices. Our work builds upon numerous previous studies that have applied mathematical models to model influenza transmission in schools (see e.g. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] ). Several studies also modeled non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closures but not absenteeism policies [19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] ). We performed a systematic analysis of studies that evaluated isolation policies by using a broad search on PubMed. We found a variety of policies involving isolation of infected individuals, particularly isolation for a fixed interval following diagnosis. For example, the large modeling consortium on pandemic influenza [18] assumed students with influenza symptoms would isolate themselves but did not examine the duration of isolation. We also found several comprehensive computational studies of school closures and isolation of infected students (e.g. [18, 33] ), but did not find evaluation of policies that would reduce transmission caused by infectious students returning from home. A related policy of symptom monitoring, that isolates contacts once they show symptoms, has been examined computationally and shown to be sufficient for controlling certain outbreaks [34] .",

When the attack rate is high, transmission might occur regardless of isolation and the policy might merely create a burden on the isolated individuals and their families, without a tangible public health benefit. If the policy is proven effective, it is not known whether the CDC-recommended one day of symptom-based isolation is sufficient, and if not, how many days would be most beneficial. At the outset of our project, we hypothesized that these policies would have a small beneficial effect on reducing attack rate, delay the peak of the outbreak and reduce the height of its peak. We did not expect these policies to reduce the overall incidence because there would be many other opportunities to become infected. Furthermore, practical barriers may reduce the strictness with which the policies are enforced, which would reduce the policies' effectiveness.",

The day of infection determines the rate of virus shedding and the probability of symptoms, which then influences the decision to stay at home or to return. Generally, persons in the model were assumed to return to their community when their symptoms became less severe. The probability of returning was based on the stage of the illness, as well as the isolation policy. The isolation policy had a considerable effect on preventing premature return during the last days of illness, but also during the middle of the course of illness on days when symptoms temporarily waned. We allowed a vaccine to be received by some, if the vaccine is available ahead of the outbreak, attaining partial protection against the pathogen. The population was structured into cohorts representing ages in a school. In schools, students in the same grade generally have closer contacts to peers in the same grade, as opposed to the students in the other grades who also tend to be older or younger [41, 42] .",

Because there is conflicting data on the rates of fever symptoms with this infection, we considered two scenarios: a conservative where just 50% of the cases experience and detect fever, and a higher 88% (cf. [47] [48] [49] and [50, 51] , respectively). To ensure that the results are robust to uncertainty parameter values, we then simulated the epidemic 500 times per scenario, with substantially different values for parameters such as the start day in the year, contact rate between cohorts and others, and reported the median and the interquartile ranges (see Appendix B for details).

Consequently, isolation of infected individuals until they recover could potentially be sustained indefinitely. It is likely that such isolation policies could be useful in the control of other acute respiratory diseases. These policies are expected to be complementary to other intervention measures, and can operate when testing resources are limited. While our model is driven by rich sources of virological data and calibrated to several outbreaks, a few limitations are inherent in our approach. First, despite our use of multiple scenarios and hundreds of alternative simulations, the effect of any policy depends on the context where it would be applied. The details of the school or institution would matter, and therefore, we provide an online version of the model, which can be calibrated for each situation. Because our model 12 .",

Contact rates across cohorts and within them are described by a contact matrix, giving the model the ability to simulate a diverse set of institutions and communities.
