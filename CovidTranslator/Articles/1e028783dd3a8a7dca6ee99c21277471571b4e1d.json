Existing interferon-signaling/receptor-deficient mouse models may not be suitable for evaluating treatment effects of recombinant interferons. Methods: We developed a novel mouse model for ZIKV infection by immunosuppressing BALB/c mice with dexamethasone. Results: Dexamethasone-immunosuppressed male mice (6-8 weeks) developed disseminated infection as evidenced by the detection of ZIKV-NS1 protein expression and high viral loads in multiple organs. They had \u226510% weight loss and high clinical scores soon after dexamethasone withdrawal (10 dpi), which warranted euthanasia at 12 dpi. Viral loads in blood and most tissues at 5 dpi were significantly higher than those at 12 dpi (P b 0.05). Histological examination revealed prominent inflammatory infiltrates in multiple organs, and CD45+ and CD8+ inflammatory cells were seen in the testis. These findings suggested that clinical deterioration occurred during viral clearance by host immune response. Type I interferon treatments improved clinical outcome of mice (100% vs 0% survival). Conclusions: Besides virus dissemination, inflammation of various tissues, especially orchitis, may be potential complications of ZIKV infection with significant implications on disease transmission and male fertility. Interferon treatment should be considered in patients at high risks for ZIKV-associated complications when the potential benefits outweigh the side effects of treatment.",

Since 2007, large-scale outbreaks of ZIKV infection have occurred in the Pacific islands, Latin America, and most recently, USA and Southeast Asia (Duffy et al., 2009; Musso and Gubler, 2016; Zhu et al., 2016) . As of 27 October 2016, N 70 countries/territories have EBioMedicine 14 (2016) 112-122 reported continuing mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV (World Health Organization. Zika situation report. October 27, 2016) . In addition to mosquito-borne transmission, sexual and transplacental transmissions of ZIKV have also been reported (Chan et al., 2016a; Musso et al., 2015a; Foy et al., 2011; Calvet et al., 2016) . These non-vectorborne transmission routes render the control of the continuing epidemic more complicated.",

However, it has been recently recognized that infected mothers may transmit the virus transplacentally to developing fetuses, leading to congenital malformations, including microcephaly, cerebral malformations, ophthalmological and hearing defects, and arthrogryposis (Chan et al., 2016a; Mlakar et al., 2016; de Paula et al., 2016; Leal et al., 2016) . Some infected adults may also develop severe neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and myelitis (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016; Carteaux et al., 2016; Mecharles et al., 2016) . Moreover, ZIKV-related fatalities have been increasingly recognized. Most of the patients with fatal infection had underlying medical conditions and some were markedly immunosuppressed, including a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis who was on corticosteroid therapy and died of disseminated infection with detectable ZIKV RNA in blood, brain, spleen, liver, kidney, lung, and heart obtained at postmortem examination (Pan American Health Organization/World Health Oganization (PAHO/WHO), 2015; Sarmiento-Ospina et al., 2016; Arzuza-Ortega et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "A number of animal models have been developed for studying the pathogenesis and evaluating countermeasures for ZIKV infection. Rhesus macaques with subcutaneous ZIKV inoculation develop mild clinical signs that resemble the self-limiting illness in most infected immunocompetent adults (Dudley et al., 2016) . This non-human primate model provides a robust platform for the evaluation of vaccines and host immune response (Abbink et al., 2016) . However, the mild clinical disease in these primates is suboptimal for antiviral treatment evaluation. Moreover, expertise and facilities for working with non-human primates are not available in most research laboratories. Wild-type adult BALB/c mice are not susceptible to intraperitoneal ZIKV inoculation (Dick, 1952) . Suckling and young mice with intracerebral ZIKV inoculation develop disease that is localized to the central nervous system (Dick, 1952; Way et al., 1976; Weinbren and Williams, 1958; Bell et al., 1971) . Pregnant mice and fetal mice with partially intact type I interferon signaling response (fetuses of female mice deficienct in type I interferon signaling response crossed to wild-type male mice) were used to study pathogenesis in pregnancy and maternalfetal transmission, but these models are technically more demanding (Miner et al., 2016; Cugola et al., 2016) . Type I/II interferon-signaling-/ receptor-deficient mice with intraperitoneal or subcutaneous ZIKV inoculation develop fatal, disseminated infection (Lazear et al., 2016; Dowall et al., 2016; Aliota et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016) . These models are useful for the evaluation of countermeasures for ZIKV infection as the protective effects of antivirals drugs and vaccines are more easily observed in treated mice. However, such models have complete/nearcomplete deficiency in interferon response and do not resemble the real clinical situation in immunosuppressed humans. Moreover, these mice are suboptimal for the study of host immune response and may be too expensive for laboratories in resource-limited areas.",

For virus titration, aliquots of ZIKV were applied on confluent Vero cells in 96well plates for 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay as we previously described with slight modifications (Zhou et al., 2014) . Briefly, serial 10-fold dilutions of ZIKV were inoculated in a Vero cell monolayer in quadruplicate and cultured in penicillin/streptomycinsupplemented MEM. The plates were observed for cytopathic effect for 5 days. Viral titer was calculated with the Reed and M\u00fcnch endpoint method.

Male and female BALB/c mice, 6-8 weeks old, were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Unit of The University of Hong Kong. The mice were kept in biosafety level-2 housing and given access to standard pellet feed and water ad libitum. Virus inoculation experiments were performed in a biosafety level-2 animal facility according to the standard operating procedures approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research of The University of Hong Kong as we described previously (Zhang et al., 2014) . The mice were randomly divided into 11 groups and given different regimens of virus inoculation, dexamethasone, and recombinant interferon treatment (Table 1) . Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used to dilute the virus stocks to the desired concentration, and inocula were back-titrated to verify the dose given. On the day of virus inoculation, a dose of the virus equivalent to 6 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 (3.24 \u00d7 10 6 plaque forming units) in 200 \u03bcl of PBS was inoculated via the intraperitoneal route into mice under ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) anesthesia. Mice in the negative-control groups (groups 5 to 8) were injected with the same volume of PBS. Mice were monitored three times each day for clinical signs of disease and a numerical score was assigned at each observation as previously described (Dowall et al., 2016; Graham et al., 2015) . Their body weight and survival were monitored for 14 days post-inoculation (dpi) or until euthanasia. Three mice in each group (except groups 7 and 8 which included mock-infected control mice without dexamethasone immunosuppression and group 9 which included ZIKV-inoculated, dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice without dexamethasone withdrawal) were sacrificed at 5 dpi for virological, histological, and immunohistochemistry analyses. The remaining mice were sacrificed at 14 dpi or euthanized when there was a 20% weight loss or 10% weight loss with \u22651 clinical sign (Dowall et al., 2016) . Samples of brain, testis/ epididymis (male), prostate (male), ovary/uterus (female), kidney, urinary bladder, spleen, liver, pancreas, intestine, heart, lung, and salivary gland were collected at necropsy. The specimens were separated into two parts, one immediately fixed in 10% PBS-buffered formalin, the other immediately frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until further experiments. Blood samples were also collected for RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis.",

All of the female mice with dexamethasone immunosuppression and ZIKV inoculation (group 2) also had progressive weight loss and 4/6 (66.7%) of them had \u2265 10% weight loss at 14 dpi.

Together, these findings suggested that the combination of immune reconstitution after dexamethasone withdrawal and disseminated virus infection were responsible for the abrupt clinical deterioration. All of the mice in groups 1 and 2 developed rapid breathing, lethargy, and/or ruffled fur since 11 dpi (group 1) or 12 dpi (group 2), shortly after dexamethasone was stopped (Fig. 1B) . The reasons for the earlier onset of weight loss and symptoms in the male mice were not fully understood, but might be related to the higher cumulative dose of dexamethasone because of their higher baseline body weights and/or possible effects of androgen on virus replication (Tian et al., 2012) .

These findings confirmed that mice with ZIKV inoculation but no dexamethasone immunosuppression were not susceptible to infection as previously reported, and that the histological changes in the model mice (groups 1 and 2) were unrelated to dexamethasone-induced effects such as drug-induced testicular toxicity (Lazear et al., 2016; Dowall et al., 2016; Aliota et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016; Khorsandi et al., 2013) . The absence of inflammatory infiltrates in ZIKV-inoculated, dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice without dexamethasone withdrawal (group 9) supported the role of the host immune response in eliciting the clinical and histological changes in the ZIKV-inoculated mice with dexamethasone withdrawal (groups 1 and 2). To further confirm the presence of inflammatory infiltrates and characterize the cell types involved in the host immune response, we stained the necropsied testis of the dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice with ZIKV inoculation and those of the dexamethasoneimmunosuppressed mock-infected control mice with CD45 (pan-leukocyte) and CD8 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) antibodies. Corroborative to the histological findings, only the testis of the dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice with ZIKV inoculation, but not those of the control mice, stained positive for CD45 ( Fig. 5E and F) and CD8 antibodies ( Fig. 5G and H). These findings confirmed the presence of inflammatory infiltrates and especially CD8+ T lymphocytes in the testis of the ZIKV-infected mice.",

This has led us to hypothesize that, like many other flavivirus infections, including yellow fever, dengue, and West Nile virus infection, the host immune response may also play a role in these ZIKV-associated complications, especially during the viral clearance phase by the host immune system (Quaresma et al., 2013; Screaton et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2003) . In this study, we characterized a novel and readily available mouse model for severe ZIKV infection which attempts to provide an alternative venue for studying the host immune response of and evaluating countermeasures for ZIKV infection.

Immunohistochemistry staining of the testis confirmed the presence of inflammatory cell infiltrate (pan-leukocyte marker CD45 +) with predominantly CD8 + T lymphocytes. Clinically, the male mice developed earlier onset of disease than the female mice, with \u226510% weight loss and \u22651 clinical sign, which warranted euthanasia at 12 dpi. Their weight loss, clinical scores, and histological evidence of inflammatory reactions were most severe soon after dexamethasone withdrawal, when viral loads had already decreased by about 2-5 log 10 copies/10 6 \u03b2-actin. Overall, these findings suggested that, like the other related flaviviruses, the host immune response might have led to marked clinical deterioration in the face of disseminated ZIKV infection at the time when immune-mediated clearance of the virus began. Our findings provided an additional explanation for the pathogenesis of fatal ZIKV infection, which has been proposed to be related to uncontrolled virus dissemination in previously described mouse models utilizing types I/II interferon-signaling-/receptor-deficient mice that were unable to mount a robust host innate immune response.",

In addition to the reported findings of detectable virus particles and/or RNA in the brain, spinal cord, kidney, spleen, liver, testis, ovary, heart, lung, muscle, and blood of types I/II interferon-signaling-/receptor-deficient mice with ZIKV infection, our study identified intestine, pancreas, and salivary gland as other possible tissues and anatomical sites for virus infection (Dick, 1952; Lazear et al., 2016; Dowall et al., 2016; Aliota et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016) . This tissue tropism of ZIKV in our mouse model concurs with the in-vitro observation that ZIKV efficiently replicates in diverse cell types of neuronal, testicular, prostatic, renal, intestinal, hepatic, and placental origin (Chan et al., 2016b; Brault et al., 2016; Hughes et al., 2016) . Such degree of virus dissemination and multiorgan involvement is also compatible with the clinical findings in patients with severe and/or fatal ZIKV infection, in whom viral particles and/or RNA were detected in multiple organs at post-mortem examination (Pan American Health Organization/World Health Oganization (PAHO/WHO), 2015; Sarmiento-Ospina et al., 2016; Arzuza-Ortega et al., 2016) . While inflammatory neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and myelitis, have been recently reported in patients with ZIKV infection, inflammatory disorders of the other non-neuronal tissues were not well recognized (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016; Carteaux et al., 2016; Mecharles et al., 2016) . Our findings showed that inflammation could be observed in multiple organs including the testis, kidney, spleen, liver, intestine, pancreas, lung, and salivary gland outside the nervous system.",

            "text": "Among these non-neuronal tissues, the inflammatory reactions were most prominent in the testis of our model mice. Some patients with ZIKV infection reported hematospermia, pelvic pain, and dysuria with detectable viral particles and/or RNA in their semen (Chan et al., 2016a; Musso et al., 2015a; Foy et al., 2011) . Histological evidence of orchitis has not been reported due to the difficulty in obtaining the patients' testicular tissues for histological examination. Previous mouse Fig. 4 . Representative histological findings in the brain and kidney of dexamethasone-immunosuppressed BALB/c mice with ZIKV inoculation and dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mock-infected control mice. The brain and kidneys of all sacrificed mice were examined. Each organ was entirely embedded in one paraffin block, and one full-face paraffin section at the maximum diameter of each organ was examined per block. Sections of the brain (12 dpi) of a dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mouse with ZIKV inoculation showing (A) moderate degree of perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and (B) marked lymphocytic infiltration in the cortical parenchyma (H&E, original magnification \u00d7400). Section of the brain (12 dpi) of dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mock-infected mouse showing normal architecture in the parenchyma (C) (H&E, original magnification \u00d7400). Sections of the kidney (12 dpi) showing (D) acute tubulitis with a large amount of inflammatory exudation in tubular lumens and (E) moderate degree of interstitial inflammation (H&E, original magnification \u00d7400). (F) Section of the kidney (12 dpi) of a dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mock-infected mouse showing normal architecture (H&E, original magnification \u00d7400). models for ZIKV infection utilizing types I/II interferon-signaling-/receptor-deficient mice have also showed that viral particles and RNA could be detected in the mice's testes, but histological analysis were not reported (Lazear et al., 2016) . The markedly necrotic and hemorrhagic seminiferous tubules observed in our mice are highly alarming as orchitis may have long-term effects on fertility. These changes were not accountable by dexamethasone-induced testicular toxicity, as they were morphologically different from the latter, and were not present in any of the testes of the control mice with dexamethasone treatment and mock infection (Khorsandi et al., 2013) . During revision of this work, similar findings were reported in the testes of C57BL/6 mice treated with anti-Ifna1 blocking monoclonal antibody and inoculated with ZIKV . Clinical studies to confirm the presence of orchitis and to assess the fertility of convalescent male patients should be conducted to ascertain the long-term consequences of ZIKV infection regarding reproductive and hormonal derangements. Inflammation of other organs, such as acute tubulitis, interstitial nephritis, sialadenitis, hepatitis, enteritis, and acute pancreatitis have been reported in patients with ZIKV or other flavivirus infections (Chan et al., 2016a; Sarmiento-Ospina et al., 2016; Arzuza-Ortega et al., 2016; Duijster et al., 2016; Bonaldo et al., 2016; Gourinat et al., 2015; Musso et al., 2015b; Mercado et al., 2016; Bhagat et al., 2012; Torres et al., 2000; Macnamara, 1954; Chatterjee et al., 2014) . These potential complications may be increasingly recognized as the ZIKV epidemic continues to expand into developed countries with a large ageing and immunosuppressed population.",

            "text": "Finally, our mouse model also provided a novel avenue for the evaluation of anti-ZIKV treatment. Type I interferons have broad-spectrum antiviral activities including those against ZIKV, but type I interferonsignaling-/receptor-deficient mice were not suitable for evaluation of the effects of recombinant type I interferons. We therefore evaluated the antiviral effects of two commercially available preparations of recombinant type I interferons in this new mouse model (Hamel et al., 2015; Zumla et al., 2016; Chan et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2015b) . We showed that the early use of either drug was associated with improved clinical outcome with no fatality (100% fatality in untreated mice), markedly decreased inflammatory response after dexamethasone withdrawal, and reduced viral loads in various tissues of the mice as compared to those of the untreated mice. The viral load reductions were especially significant in the early phase of the disease (5 dpi), when the mice were on dexamethasone. These findings suggested that the early use of recombinant interferons might help to control viral replication during the initial phase of infection, and prevent the subsequent development of severe complications related to an exaggerated immune response in the presence of high viral loads as seen in the untreated mice. It is important to further confirm these results in our mouse model using different ZIKV strains and in clinical trials because ZIKV antagonizes mouse STAT2 less efficiently than human STAT2, and thus may be more susceptible to type I interferons in mice (Grant et al., 2016) . While most patients with mild ZIKV infection may not require systemic interferon treatment, clinical trials should be considered to evaluate the benefits of the early use of interferon treatment in patients at risk of developing severe ZIKV-associated complications, such as those with underlying comorbidities (Sarmiento-Ospina et al., 2016) . The increased risk of fetal loss and low birth weight associated with interferon therapy in the first trimester of pregnancy may be outweighed by the risk of congenital malformations due to ZIKV infection. The optimal timing of treatment commencement should be further investigated as late commencement of interferon treatment may be useless or deleterious and should be avoided (Solomon et al., 2003) .",
