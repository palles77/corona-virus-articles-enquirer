In 85% of confirmed SARS cases (n = 20), the S2 recombinant fragment based WB was positive and this was comparable to the commercial ELISA using heat killed SARS-CoV. WB using the other four recombinant fragments in confirmed SARS cases generated lower rates of detection (S1-75%, S1-N-25%, S1-C-55%). Evaluation of sera from healthy controls (n = 60) resulted in two weakly positive ELISA results with the remainder being negative while the S2 protein WB demonstrated three positive results from the 20 controls with a history of SARS contact and no positive results in 40 noncontact controls. A discrepancy between the ELISA and S2 WB arose when evaluating per-2003 sera from individuals (n = 10) with SARS-like symptoms (ELISA-100% positive, S2 WB-30% positive). These data suggest that the S2 WB assay may be particularly useful in ELISA-negative SARS cases and in some ELISA-positive non-SARS cases. D",

A total of nine cases (including three suspected cases) were reported and a female patient died. SARS is caused by a new strain of human coronavirus (CoV) that has been isolated from SARS patients [2, 3] . Unlike other human CoVs, which cause mild respiratory infection [4] [5] [6] [7] comprising approximately 15-30% of common colds [8, 9] , the SARS-CoV causes severe respiratory infection, which progresses to acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the mortality around 10% [10] . In the early stage of SARS or in atypical SARS, patients usually demonstrate symptoms similar to the common cold or influenza. In this situation, the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV has been used to confirm the diagnosis of SARS. It is also important to analyze the immunogens in SARS-CoV and their capacity to elicit protective immunity, to better characterize the immune response for early diagnosis, and to understand the immunopathogenesis of the SARS.",

During a coronavirus infection, the S1 subunit binds to its specific receptors on host cells [11, 12] , followed by the S2 subunit mediating fusion between the virus and host cell membrane leading to the entry of virus into the cells. In previous studies of coronavirus infection, the S protein is a potent immunogen, which induces neutralizing antibodies [13] . After infection, neutralizing antibodies are typically directed against certain fragments of S1 or S2, which can block the receptor recognition and membrane fusion of the coronavirus [14] . Recent reports showed that the viral receptor, ACE2, binding site was linked to the fragment of the C terminal of S1 and S2 [15, 16] , and this suggests that antibodies against S1-C and S2 may be associated with the generation of protective immune response.",

Briefly, each expressed fragment of S protein was amplified with the template of plasmid containing corresponding full-length cDNA of SARS-CoV S gene (Gifts from Dr. Yong Xie, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) and specific primers ( Table 2 ). The amplified products were digested with restriction endonuclease BamHI and KpnI.

In the 85% of these serum samples, antibodies against SARS-CoV were detected with a commercial ELISA assay were also positive using the WB with recombinant S2 protein that we developed. Antibodies were not detected using either test method in the healthy control sera with the exception of two weakly reactive samples. Furthermore, only serum from one patient was negative with both the commercial ELISA and WB based on the S2 recombinant protein.

On the other hand, antibodies against S1-C and S2 by WB were detected only in sera from SARS-recovered donors and some donors with SARS contact history. In some commercial ELISA-negative serum samples, antibodies to S1-C and S2 by WB were positive possibly due to the destruction or alteration of SARS-CoV surface protein during the viral preparation process for the ELISA kits.

As shown above, recombinant S1 and its fragments as a target for antibody detection do not appear to provide additional useful diagnostic information. However, 10 ELISA-positive (OD b 0.5) sera were identified from patients collected before SARS outbreak in 2003 with symptoms that included fever. These sera were tested using the WB assay with recombinant S2 subunit and three of these were positive.

As might be expected, the positive rate in these serum samples was lower than that found in SARSconfirmed cases obtained from The First Hospital of Peking University. This may be due to non-SARS patients being present within these two groups and/or the absence of a significant antibody response early in the course of SARS. If the latter circumstance is correct, then the evaluation of the diagnostic effectiveness of a test method including ELISA or WB should be established using sera from SARSconfirmed cases rather than SARS-suspected cases. The time course of antibody generation to SARS-CoV following the onset of symptoms is an important diagnostic issue and has been previously reported to vary widely [20] -from 3 days to more than 1 month following the onset of fever (data not shown).",

Our data suggest that the recombinant S1-C and S2 may have potential use in the production of SARS vaccines.
