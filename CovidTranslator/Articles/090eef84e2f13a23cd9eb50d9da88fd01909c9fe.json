MAV-1 infects endothelial cells throughout the mouse, and monocytes/macrophages have also been implicated as targets of the virus. Here we determined the extent and functional importance of macrophage infection by MAV-1. Bone marrow-derived macrophages expressed MAV-1 mRNAs and proteins upon ex vivo infection. Adherent peritoneal macrophages from infected mice expressed viral mRNAs and produced infectious virus. Infected chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) knockout mice, which are defective for macrophage recruitment, did not show differences in survival or MAV-1 load compared to controls. In contrast, macrophage depletion using clodronate-loaded liposomes resulted in increased virus replication in spleens of a MAV-1-resistant mouse strain, BALB/cJ. Thus macrophages serve both as targets of infection and as effectors of the host response.",

There are three primary functions of monocytic phagocytes: antigen presentation, phagocytosis of debris and pathogens, and immunomodulation. Due to these functions, monocytic phagocytes also are effector and regulatory cells of the adaptive immune response. When monocytic cells become infected by viruses or bacteria, these innate and adaptive immune functions can be compromised.",

We also isolated peritoneal macrophages and splenic macrophages from MAV-1-infected mice and demonstrated that MAV-1 early and late genes are expressed in both these cell types and infectious virus is produced in peritoneal macrophages. Since macrophages are effector cells of the innate response, and because they are a target of MAV-1 infection, we investigated whether biochemical depletion of macrophages compromised immune function and thus altered the outcome of MAV-1 infection. We quantitated viral loads in brains and spleens of mice of a MAV-1-resistant strain, BALB/cJ, whose macrophages had been depleted with clodronate-loaded liposomes. We also measured viral loads in brains and spleens of MAV-1-infected BALB/cJ mice knocked out for CCR2. Our data indicate that macrophages are both targets of MAV-1 and effectors of the immune response to infection.",

To determine whether the virus replicates in monocytes, we performed ex vivo infections of bone marrow-derived macrophages and DCs. We cultured primary mouse bone marrow cells from 3-week old mice with either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF/CSF2), which causes monocytes to differentiate into DCs (Zou and Tam, 2002) , or with L cell media that provides macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF/CSF1) for macrophage differentiation (Tushinski et al., 1982) . After six days of culture, an aliquot of the cells cultured to produce macrophages was stained for flow cytometry with antibodies to two macrophage surface markers, F4/80 and CD11b. The majority of cells present were positive for both markers (>99%, data not shown). Cells from the GM-CSF-treated cultures were incubated with magnetic beads coupled to CD11c antibody to positively select immature DCs. The CD11c selection routinely resulted in a population of cells that was >90% CD11c + (data not shown). Some natural killer (NK) cells have also been shown to be CD11c + (Laouar et al., 2005) , so they may have been present in the CD11c + population from spleens; it is not known whether NK cells are infected by MAV-1. The macrophages and CD11c + cells from both bone marrow and spleen were then mock-infected or infected with MAV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 48 hr, and mRNA was isolated and analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT)-PCR with MAV-1 E3 or mouse \u03b2-actin primers. We reasoned that if the virus were replicating and not simply present subsequent to phagocytosis, viral mRNA would be detected. Figure 1 shows the results for the bone marrow-derived CD11c + cells (lanes 2 and 3) and macrophages (lanes 5 and 6). E3 mRNA was detected in all the infected samples, indicating that MAV-1 infected both macrophages and CD11c + cells from bone marrow ex vivo.",

We isolated peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) of SJL/JCr mice infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10 4 PFU of MAV-1 for 4 days or from control mock-infected mice. The PECs were allowed to attach for ~3 hrs to tissue culture dishes; 1 hr after plating, 90% of adherent cells are macrophages (Davies and Gordon, 2005) . RNA from the adherent cells was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR with primers specific for genes for MAV-1 E3, MAV-1 hexon (a late viral capsid protein), or mouse \u03b2-actin. The results showed that the PECs from infected mice expressed E3 (Fig. 3, lanes 4 , 5) and hexon mRNA (lane 9). Similar results were obtained at different times and virus doses in inbred and in outbred Swiss mice (data not shown). Adherent cells isolated from spleens of SJL/JCr infected mice were also positive for MAV-1 E3 (Fig. 3 , lane 13). To demonstrate that infection of these cells was productive, we measured infectious virus yields from adherent peritoneal cells from infected SJL/JCr mice by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assays at 1, 48, and 96 hrs after cells had adhered (Fig. 4 ). Virus yields increased over time, indicating that adherent peritoneal cells were productively infected in SJL/JCr mice by MAV-1. SJL mice are highly susceptible to MAV-1, whereas BALB/c mice are less susceptible (Spindler et al., 2001; Welton et al., 2005) . In a similar TCID 50 assay of adherent peritoneal cells from BALB/c mice infected at the same dose and time as the SJL/ JCr mice (10 4 PFU, assayed 4 days post infection), we detected no infectious virus (data not shown). However we found similar levels of virus yield from bone marrow macrophages of BALB/c and SJL/JCr mice infected ex vivo, 1.2 \u00d7 10 5 and 2.0 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/ml, respectively. These data suggest that the strain differences in susceptibility between SJL and BALB/c mice are manifested only in vivo in assays of macrophages. The higher susceptility of SJL mice to MAV-1 infection may be a cause or effect of the higher replication levels in vivo seen in peritoneal cells of those mice compared to BALB/c mice.",

We used clodronate-loaded liposomes, which deplete macrophages from liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and peritoneum, but not brain or blood monocytes (Van Rooijen, 1989) . We treated BALB/cJ or SJL/J mice with i.p. injections of liposomes two days prior to i.p. infection with 10 2 PFU of MAV-1; these inbred mice are resistant and susceptible to MAV-1 infection, respectively (Spindler et al., 2001; Welton et al., 2005) . Eight days post infection, mice were euthanized and organs were harvested for analysis. We confirmed the effectiveness of the clodronate treatment by flow cytometry with antibody to F4/80: clodronate liposomes routinely depleted splenic macrophages to 5-15% of untreated levels (data not shown). The treatment in both strains of mice did not alter clinical signs of infection (data not shown). A few SJL/J infected mice showed neurological signs (seizures) as they were transferred for euthanasia, but this was seen in both control and clodronate liposome-treated mice. Control (PBS-treated) MAV-1-infected BALB/cJ mice had low viral loads and SJL/J mice had high viral loads (Fig. 5A ), consistent with these strains being resistant and susceptible to MAV-1, respectively (Spindler et al., 2001; Welton et al., 2005) . Viral loads were measured by capture ELISA . Treatment with clodronate liposomes did not alter the brain viral loads for either strain relative to controls: again levels were low in BALB/ cJ mice and high in SJL/J mice (Fig. 5A ). Using the Mann-Whitney U test, we determined there was no statistically significant difference between the mean brain viral loads of control and clodronate-treated mice for either mouse strain. This suggests that depletion of those populations of macrophages affected by clodronate liposomes (e.g., peritoneal and splenic macrophages) did not significantly alter the infection as measured in the brain.",

            "text": "To address the importance of macrophage function in another way, we determined whether mice genetically defective in macrophage recruitment fared better or worse than control mice when infected with MAV-1. We used CCR2 -/mice, which lack the receptor for the chemokine CCL2 and other ligands (Kuziel et al., 1997) . These mice are defective for recruitment of macrophages to the peritoneum (Boring et al., 1997; Kurihara et al., 1997; Kuziel et al., 1997) , liver (Dambach et al., 2002; Hokeness et al., 2005) , central nervous system (Held et al., 2004) , and kidney (Kitagawa et al., 2004) . Whether they are defective for recruitment to the lung is dependent on the model (Baran et al., 2007; Lu et al., 1998; Moore et al., 2001) , and to our knowledge, effects on other organs have not been reported. CCR2 -/mice on a BALB/cJ strain background or wild-type BALB/cJ mice were infected i.p. with 10 2 or 10 6 PFU of MAV-1. Brains and spleens were harvested 8 days post infection and assayed for viral loads (Fig. 6) . No significant differences in brain viral loads were seen between control BALB/cJ and CCR2 -/mice at either virus dose, although there were slightly higher virus levels in mice of both strains that received the 10 6 PFU dose compared to the 10 2 PFU dose. Similarly, there were no significant differences between spleen viral loads in BALB/cJ vs. CCR2 -/mice at either dose, though in both strains the mice that received 10 6 PFU had higher viral loads. In addition, CCR2 -/mice were given doses of 10 4 , 10 5 , or 10 6 PFU of MAV-1 and monitored for 21 days post infection. Morbidity and mortality due to MAV-1 infection usually occur within the first 3-14 days post infection (reviewed in Spindler et al., 2007) . The mice survived to 21 days, exhibited no clinical signs, and had no virus detectable by ELISA in brains and spleens at the conclusion of the experiment (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the lack of CCR2 did not render BALB/cJ mice more susceptible to MAV-1.",

Because the methods by which the presence of the virus was detected are only moderately sensitive, we postulated that the virus is not simply phagocytosed, but that it replicates in the cells to levels such that nucleic acid and antigen are detectable. To test this, we used RT-PCR to detect expression of viral mRNAs, which would not be present in non-replicating (phagocytosedonly) virus particles. We first demonstrated that MAV-1 infects macrophages and bone marrow-derived CD11c + cells (predominantly DCs) ex vivo; both early and late viral gene expression was detected when these monocyte-derived cells were isolated by standard methods and infected with MAV-1. The bone marrow-derived CD11c + cell population was not 100% pure (it was > 90% CD11c + ), and NK cells can also be CD11c + , so further experiments will be needed to determine whether DCs are infected ex vivo by MAV-1. The intracellular virus staining assay provided strong corroborating evidence of the finding that macrophages are expressing early MAV-1 genes: F4/80 + , CD11b + cells were positive for early protein expression by this assay.",

It was possible that viral genes were expressed but infectious virus was not produced, so we also assayed for infectious virus. We were unable to detect virus production from adherent peritoneal cells by plaque assays, which have a limit of detection of 2 \u00d7 10 2 PFU/ml. Thus we turned to a more sensitive assay and demonstrated that these cells did produce a low level of infectious virus. This low level of virus production (1 TCID 50 unit/300 peritoneal macrophages) suggests that replication is inefficient and/or that only a small subset of cells is capable of producing mature virus. For comparison, we have determined virus yield from permissive 3T6 fibroblasts to be 90 PFU/cell (data not shown). A block to efficient virus production could occur at many steps subsequent to early viral gene mRNA synthesis, including DNA replication, post-transcriptional events (protein translation and stability), virus maturation, and release. Since the adherent cell populations are enriched (>90%) for macrophages, it is possible that a non-macrophage adherent cell type is responsible for replication by the virus. However, given the results of the intracellular virus staining of F4/80 + , CD11b + cells, we believe macrophages are a target of MAV-1 infection and that they produce infectious virus.",

This uptake by Kupffer cells has been associated with rapid cell death when very large doses of virus are given (Manickan et al., 2006) . Uptake of hAds by mouse Kupffer cells involves scavenger receptors rather than integrins or the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, and opsonization by natural IgM antibodies and complement contribute to clearance of the virus (Xu et al., 2008) . To our knowledge there are no reports of hAd infection of macrophages in people, but in vitro studies indicate that the virus can bind and enter monocytic cells via integrins (Huang et al., 1996) .",

            "text": "Because macrophages are effectors of innate and adaptive immunity, it seemed possible that depletion of macrophages might increase the severity of MAV-1 infection. Alternatively, because macrophages are targets of MAV-1 infection, their depletion might decrease disease severity. Depletion of macrophages generally makes animals more susceptible to pathogens, including fungi, parasites, bacteria, and viruses (Pinto et al., 1991; Qian et al., 1994; Vreden et al., 1993) . We investigated the effect of depleting mice of liver, spleen, lymph node and peritoneal macrophages by treatment with clodronate-loaded liposomes (Van Rooijen, 1989 ). This treatment does not deplete brain or blood monocytes, though in the spleen it has been shown to deplete marginal DCs of the spleen (Leenen et al., 1998) . We used a resistant mouse strain, BALB/cJ, to determine whether the treatment would increase pathogenesis (by removing immune effector cells), and a susceptible mouse strain, SJL/J, to determine if the treatment would decrease pathogenesis (by removing target cells) (Spindler et al., 2001; Welton et al., 2005) . Viral loads in susceptible SJL/J mice were unchanged by treatment with the liposomes. In contrast, viral loads in the spleens of BALB/cJ mice were significantly higher in macrophage-depleted mice, approaching levels seen in spleens of susceptible SJL/J mice. Thus depletion of macrophages increased the severity of infection in resistant mice, as measured by spleen viral loads. The BALB/cJ brain viral loads did not differ between controland liposome-treated mice. This could be due to the fact that brain macrophages are not depleted by the clodronate-liposome treatment. This result could also occur if macrophages do not play a role in controlling viral levels in the brain. The experiments described here do not distinguish between these possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive. However, we have observed that MAV-1 infection does result in increased numbers of macrophages in brains of C57BL/6NCr mice (Gralinski and Spindler, unpublished) . Expression of F4/80 mRNA is increased in MAV-1-infected mouse brains relative to mock-infected mice (Weinberg et al., 2007) . These results suggest there may be a protective role for macrophages in the brain. If macrophages contribute to dissemination of the virus from peritoneum to the brain, then there must also be a second mechanism for dissemination since macrophage depletion did not affect brain viral loads. Treatment of mice intraperitoneally by clodronate liposomes resulted in depletion of 85-95% of splenic macrophages; these numbers are comparable to results obtained by others . Our data suggest that the residual macrophages were not able to protect BALB/cJ mice from viral replication in the spleen.",

            "text": "In other models that examine the role of macrophages in viral infection, depletion of macrophages by clodronate liposome treatment or other means also results in increased viral replication in the spleen or other organs. For example, in hAd infection of rats, when infection of Kupffer cells is blocked by treatment with polyinosinic acid, there is an increase in infection of surrounding liver cells (Haisma et al., 2008) . Clodronate-liposome treatment of mice increases replication of mouse cytomegalovirus in the spleen (Hanson et al., 1999) . In addressing whether macrophages function more as targets or effectors in mouse cytomegalovirus infection, the authors concluded that the latter role, particularly the production of cytokines, outweighs the role of macrophages as target cells. Their data suggest that the macrophages may function as \"filters\" or \"sinks\" for the virus, keeping other permissive cell types from being infected by the virus. A somewhat analogous result was found for measles virus, for which macrophages are a major target (Roscic-Mrkic et al., 2001) . Mice are not a natural host for measles, but in transgenic mice expressing the measles receptor, human CD46, the most efficiently infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells are F4/80 + (macrophages). Depletion of splenic or lung macrophages in these mice resulted in enhanced viral replication in the spleen or lung, respectively. Furthermore, in each organ, there was a concomitant activation and infection of DCs. Thus macrophages contribute to protection of other immune cells from measles infection. We do not know whether macrophages similarly protect other immune cells, such as endothelial cells or DCs, from MAV-1 infection, or whether macrophages protect other surrounding cell types from MAV-1 infection, similar to the protective effect postulated for Kupffer cells in hAd infection (Haisma et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "In contrast to increased viral loads in the spleens of BALB/cJ mice following macrophage depletion, we saw no differences in spleen or brain viral loads of CCR2 -/mice infected with MAV-1 compared to BALB/cJ mice. Thus clodronate liposome-depleted mice are not functionally equivalent to mice that lack CCR2 with respect to MAV-1 infection. This may be due to differences in immune cell populations in the two models, e.g., DCs. In addition to depleting macrophages, clodronate liposome treatment depletes marginal DCs in the spleen but not CD8 + interdigitating DCs (Leenen et al., 1998) . A subset of CCR2 + murine blood monocytes recruited to inflammatory sites can differentiate into DCs (Geissmann et al., 2003) ; this population would be absent in the CCR2 -/mice. CCR2 -/mice are defective for recruitment of macrophages to the peritoneum after a stimulus, but the resident numbers of macrophages in the peritoneum do not differ compared to wild-type mice (Boring et al., 1997; Kurihara et al., 1997; Kuziel et al., 1997) . We suggest that the resident macrophages or other factors (e.g., cells or cytokines) in CCR2 -/mice were sufficient to protect mice from MAV-1 replication in the spleen upon i.p. infection. In most infection models using CCR2 -/mice there are increases in replication of the infectious agent compared to control mice, for example, infection with Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptococcus neoformans, Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus fumigatus, mouse cytomegalovirus, and neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (Benevides et al., 2008; Blease et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2001; Dunay et al., 2008; Held et al., 2004; Hokeness et al., 2005; Kurihara et al., 1997; Traynor et al., 2000) . However, in the case of influenza virus, infection of at least one CCR2 -/mouse strain showed no increases in influenza virus titers or delayed viral clearance, though there were clear changes in leukocyte recruitment compared to controls (Wareing et al., 2007) . These authors suggested that the deficiency in CCR2 may have altered the development of immune responses without altering the outcome of influenza virus infection. Scott and Flynn (2002) found that for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, the dose affected whether differences were seen between CCR2 -/mice and controls. At low doses, the CCR2-deficient mice had bacterial loads similar to wild-type mice and successfully formed granulomas, whereas at high doses the mice were less able to control infection than wild-type mice. The authors suggest that the normal immune response may be greater than is necessary for control of the infection, such that deficiency in CCR2 -/does not have effects at low doses of bacteria. Our results for MAV-1 may have more similarity to the influenza case, because we found no difference in survival of CCR2 -/mice compared to wild-type mice even at very high doses that resulted in high viral loads in both mouse strains.",

Adherent cells (6 \u00d7 10 6 ) pooled from 15 SJL/JCr mice 4 days after infection with 10 4 PFU of MAV-1 i.p. were sampled at 1, 48, and 96 hr post plating. The cells were harvested in 5 ml of media, freeze-thawed three times, and centrifuged to remove debris. Serial 10-fold dilutions of the supernatants were plated (three or more wells per dilution) on 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well of mouse 3T6 cells in 96-well plates. Cytopathic effect was scored 4-6 days after infection. The TCID 50 was calculated as the inverse of the dilution at which 50% of the wells showed cytopathic effect, calculated by the method of Reed & Muench (1938) . A control virus stock of high titer was titrated by TCID 50 and plaque assay, and 1 PFU corresponded to 68 TCID 50 units. A-D, bone marrow-derived macrophages were mock-infected or infected with of MAV-1 (MOI = 5) for 48 hr. Cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with antibody to F4/80 and either CD11b (A, C) or MAV-1 E3 gp11K (E3) (B, D). The number in each quadrant indicates the percentage of total cells that are in that quadrant. In panel A, cells were permeabilized but only labeled with secondary antibody, to control for autofluorescence of the cells; C is a control showing that the majority of cells stained with both macrophage markers. Mice were treated with 400 \u03bcl PBS or clodronate liposomes (Lipo) two days prior to infection, then infected with 10 2 PFU MAV-1 or mock-infected. A. Brain viral loads from mice of the indicated strains and treatments 8 days post infection, measured by capture ELISA. B. Spleen viral loads of the same mice as in A. Some mice had such small spleens that after confirmation of macrophage depletion, insufficient samples remained for viral load determination. Each bar represents the viral load of an individual mouse and each mouse homogenate was assayed in triplicate in the ELISA. The mean and standard deviation of the triplicates are shown. There were no statistically significant differences between PBS and Lipo samples for any group except for spleen viral loads in BALB/cJ mice, in which P = 0.003 (Mann-Whitney U test).",
