            "text": "Background Respiratory infections are the main causes for hospitalization in children and a common reason for the initiation of antibiotic treatment. Rapid antigen detection tests and point-of-care mPCR-based assays provide a fast detection of viral pathogens. Nonetheless, the prescription rate of antibiotics for respiratory infections is exceedingly high. In particular, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections frequently cause antibiotic treatment. Methods Children hospitalized in our clinic with an acute respiratory infection between January 2008 and January 2013 were included in the present study. Data of 3799 children were analyzed retrospectively for clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and antibiotic and inhalation treatment. We performed an in-house m-RT-PCR-ELISA method for pathogen detection. Results Pathogen detection was possible in 2464 patients. In 6.3%, hMPV and, in 24.0%, RSV were detected. Patients positively tested for hMPV received inhalation therapy in 62.9%; patients positive for RSV in 73.8%. Patients positive for hMPV were treated with antibiotics in 62.3%. Patients with RSV infection received antibiotic treatment in 44.4%; all others in 43.5%. Notably, a positive result in RSV-RADT was associated with reduced number of antibiotic treatment. Conclusion hMPV infections inherit a two times higher probability of antibiotic treatment. There was no significant difference in laboratory findings or body temperature between hMPV infection and infections caused by other pathogens. Clinical symptoms seem not to differ from those in RSV illness. Nonetheless, RSV infections triggered significantly lower antibiotic prescription rates. A considerate application of a POC-mPCR for patients with RSV-like symptoms and age of 1 year and older with a negative RSV-RADT might lead to higher detection rates of hMPV and a reduction in prescription of antibiotics.",

The following 13 viruses and 5 bacterial pathogens could be detected from a single sample: enterovirus, influenza virus type A and type B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus type 1, type 2, type 3, and type 4, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus, reovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Legionella pneumophila. M-RT-PCR-ELISA was performed weekdays, when a certain number of samples had accumulated and could be processed in one run. From sample collection to the final result of the m-RT-PCR-ELISA, it took in average 3 working days. RSV and influenza RADT (Certest Biotec S.L.) were performed as POC diagnostic for every patient during admission. The sensitivity for RSV is 95% and the specificity > 99%. These data are provided by the manufacturer and reflect the results of a comparison of Certest RADT to another RADT. An evaluation by PCR was not provided.

Airway obstruction caused by RSV and hMPV was more pronounced compared to the other investigated pathogens. Interestingly, RSV was more frequently treated with inhalation and systemic steroids then hMPV. This might be confounded by our in-house standard protocol requiring inhalation with epinephrine and hypertonic saline in children with a positive RSV-RADT and may not reflect the clinical appearance of the patients. Epinehphrine inhalations were shown to reduce symptoms of bronchiolitis, especially in the first 24 h, but had no influence on the length of hospital stay [28, 29] . In contrast, there was no recommendation concerning the antibiotic therapy in RSV infection in our in-house protocol. As mentioned above, the symptoms of hMPV and RSV infection are described as undistinguishable [6, 9] , whereas other studies see more bronchiolitis in children with RSV infection and more pneumonia in hMPV-positive children [30, 31] . Moe et al. adjusted clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings to the age of the patients which led to the disappearance of all detected differences [31] . Since children with RSV infections are significantly younger than those with hMPV infection, the diagnosis of bronchiolitis seems more common, whereas elevated CRP values, wheezing, and the radiologic signs of pneumonia are more frequent in patients with hMPV infection. Regarding all discussed studies, there was no difference in the severity of disease between hMPV and RSV determined by oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay, and admission to intensive care unit [9, 30, 31] .",

Keeping in mind that a positive RSV-RADT led to the increased prescription of inhalation therapy, we assume that it might have also been related to a reduced rate of antibiotic treatment. A positive result of an RSV-RADT was associated significantly with reduced prescription of antibiotics with an OR of 0.73 (0.59-0.89). This is a clear reduction of the antibiotic prescription rate by a positive RSV-RADT. Practitioners seem to be more inclined to start a symptomatic therapy with inhalations and to refrain from antibiotic treatment, if clinical presentation of the patient and RADT both indicates RSV infection. Antibiotic therapy in RADT negative patients might be triggered by uncertainty of the etiology of the infection and not only by the severity of symptoms or laboratory findings.",

            "text": "Of course, antibiotic therapy might also be triggered by assumed bacterial coinfection, which is well described for RSV infection [32, 33] . For hMPV, only one study indicates that superinfection with S. pneumoniae can occur, since a pneumococcal vaccine reduced hospitalization of children with hMPV-associated pneumonia [34] . Bacterial coinfection, even in children presenting themselves with wheezing, has been estimated to range from 18 up to 55% [35] [36] [37] . However, it is not possible to draw a clear distinction between bacterial infection and colonization. Neither detection of bacterial pathogens and clinical and radiological signs of pneumonia, nor the decision for antibiotic treatment and positive bacterial cultures could be correlated positively to in other studies [36] . High serum levels of CRP (exceeding 40-60 mg/L) might indicate a bacterial infection [38] . In RSV infection, also lower concentrations of CRP can hint at bacterial coinfections, since RSV is known to suppress the production of proinflammatory proteins [36, 39] . A high viral load of RSV was associated with decreased CRP serum concentration [36] . hMPV lack these genes coding for proteins, which allow RSV to reduce the hosts immune response [8, 40] . In contrast, lower concentrations of interleukins were found in children infected with hMPV than in children suffering from RSV infection [41] . This underlines the challenges in decision-making concerning antibiotic treatment in children with respiratory tract infections. In our study, antibiotic treatment was likely triggered by elevated laboratory values indicating inflammation (e.g., CRP-which was particularly pronounced in children with adenovirus infections), and/or by clinical symptoms often associated with bacterial infections, like crackles on auscultation. Crackles, regarded as hallmark of pneumonia, are found in hMPV and RSV infections in 35-38% [30] .",

According to our data, children presenting themselves during winter season with RSV-like symptoms like cough, airway obstruction, and crackles on auscultation, age of 1 year and older, and a negative RSV-RADT qualify for a PCR-based point-of-care testing. Regarding Fig. 2 a cutoff at 12 months should allow to detect as many children as possible suffering from hMPV infection and those children false negative in RSV-RADT. This might lead to a reduction in antibiotic therapy. Possibly, a shorten length of antibiotic treatment and an improvement in rates of cross-infections during inpatient treatment can be achieved, as well.",
