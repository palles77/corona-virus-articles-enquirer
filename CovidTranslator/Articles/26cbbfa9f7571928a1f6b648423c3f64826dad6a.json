To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate this association. In our series, 4 of the 9 patients (44%) required more than 21 days of treatment to eradicate PCP.

Although a link between mutations in dihydropteroate synthase and sulfonamide resistance in Pneumocystis has been found in HIV infected patients receiving TMP/SMX prophylaxis, the clinical significance of this finding remains controversial. 5 Resistance testing was not available for our cohort, but is highly unlikely in this distinct population that did not receive prophylaxis before presentation.",
