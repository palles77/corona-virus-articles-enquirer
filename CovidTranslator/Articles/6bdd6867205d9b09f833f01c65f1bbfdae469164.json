            "text": "In late December, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China. 1 Deep sequencing analyses from lower respiratory tract samples revealed a novel coronavirus that was currently named 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), 2 which resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 3 Outbreaks in healthcare workers and families indicated human-to-human transmission. 1, 4 The COVID-19 is a beta-CoV of group 2B with at least 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV 5 and is the seventh member of the family of enveloped RNA coronavirus that infect humans. 6 Since January 17, the confirmed cases dramatically increased, and COVID-19 has been designated as a public health emergency of international concerns by the WHO. As of February 23, 2020, China has documented 77048 confirmed cases while the death toll rose to 2445. Moreover, more than 2000 confirmed cases were identified in other countries worldwide. The COVID-19 has posed significant threats to international health. 7 The spectrum of this disease in humans is yet to be fully determined. Signs of infection are nonspecific, including respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspnea, and viral pneumonia. 1 With the daily increase in the number of newly diagnosed and suspected cases, the diagnosis has become a growing problem in major hospitals due to the insufficient supply of nucleic acid detection boxes and limited detection rates in the epidemic area. 8 Computed tomography (CT) and radiography have thus emerged as integral players in the COVID-19's preliminary identification and diagnosis. [9] [10] [11] However, the overwhelming patients and relatively insufficient radiologists led to high false positive rate. 11 Advanced computer-aided lung CT diagnosis systems are urgently needed for accurately confirming suspected cases, screening patients, and conducting virus surveillance.",

As shown in Figure 1 , our fully automated lung CT diagnosis system was developed by three main steps. First, we extracted the main regions of lungs and filled the blank of lung segmentation with the lung itself to avoid noises caused by different lung contours. Then, we designed a Details Relation Extraction neural network (DRE-Net) to extract the top-K details in the CT images and obtain the image-level predictions. Finally, the image-level predictions were aggregated to achieve patientlevel diagnoses. Data preprocessing. Each set of 3D CT images was equally divided into 15 slices. The slices with incomplete lung were removed. The lung region in each slice were automatically extracted by the open source package OpenCV. 12 As the lung contours are of large differences between humans, the images were filled with an background composed of 10 translational and rotational lungs. Finally, we kept 88 COVID-19 patients with 777 CT images, 100 bacterial pneumonia patients with 505 slices, and 86 healthy people with 708 slices in this study.",
