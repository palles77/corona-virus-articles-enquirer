Crowding has been shown to be a risk factor for infection associated with hepatitis A virus, respiratory tract pathogens, and enteropathogens. Age-mixing exposes children to pathogens that they may not come in contact with when associating with children of their own age?7 Physical characteristics such as number and location of sinks and toilets, adequacy of ventilation, and location and cleanliness of food preparation areas are important in the spread and control of organisms. Characteristics of organisms such as ability to survive outside of the host, method of transmission, virulence mechanisms, and infective dose also are important. Many organisms can be transmitted before a child is symptomatic. In other instances, children who are asymptomatic or mildly ill may be highly infectious. Respiratory tract and enteric pathogens are the most frequently encountered infectious agents in the child-care environment.

Center characteristics that favor the spread of HAV are size, number of hours open, and age of children enrolled. Larger centers that are open more than 15 hours a day and enrolling children less than 2 years of age are at highest risk for the introduction and spread of HAV.& Once HAV is introduced into a center, the rate of spread is related to the number of diapered children and the adequacy of diaper-changing areas and hygienic practices related to diaper changing.94 Employment variables associated with seropositivity for HAV in one study included changing diapers more than 3 days a week and working with children less than 3 years of age. 58 In the past, prevention of infection with HAV centered on early recognition and hygienic measures and administration of immune globulin to exposed persons. Although these interventions continue to have an important role, two HAV vaccines are now available, allowing immunization of child-care personnel to prevent infection. Immunization of adults requires an intramuscular injection of one of the two FDA-approved adult formulations with a booster dose 6 to 12 months later. The role of the vaccine in post-exposure management currently is not clear.41",

            "text": "The child-care environment predisposes young children to infection with a variety of pathogens. Factors contributing to increased incidence of certain infections include age-specific hygiene behaviors, immunologic immaturity of young children, and exposure to pathogens with high infectivity. Respiratory tract and enteric pathogens are responsible for most illnesses, but a number of other agents are also important. Hygienic interventions, especially handwashing, remain important in infection control, but maintenance of appropriate immunization levels plays a crucial role in disease prevention in the child-care setting. Future interventions will center on development of new vaccines to eliminate susceptibility of young children to as many infectious agents as possible and continued evaluation of other preventive measures.",
