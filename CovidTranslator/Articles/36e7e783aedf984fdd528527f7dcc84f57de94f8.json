Clinical symptoms range from mild diarrhoea to life-threatening dehydration, and rotavirus disease is a major cause of childhood mortality, mainly in developing countries. The diagnosis, treatment and preventive measures are reviewed. Uncommon viral causes of acute gastroenteritis and viruses causing gastroenteritis in immunodeficient patients are also discussed. Two live attenuated rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix RTM , RotaTeq RTM ) have been licensed in >100 countries since 2006 and used in universal mass vaccination (UMV) programmes. In addition, a new rotavirus vaccine was licensed in India in 2015 for UMV. Although rotavirus vaccines are highly effective in industrialized countries, they are less so in low-income countries of sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. Vaccines against human norovirus disease are under development. Major progress has recently been made in basic research on rotaviruses and human caliciviruses.",

During the first 2 years of life, children are repeatedly infected with rotaviruses of various types, resulting in a more complex immune response that seems to provide partial heterotypic protection. Rotavirus-specific secretory antibodies of immunoglobulin A subclass in stool or serum have been identified as an important correlate of protection. 2 Caliciviruses Noroviruses (previously termed 'Norwalk-like viruses') and sapoviruses (previously termed 'Sapporo-like viruses') are the two (of five) genera of the Caliciviridae family that infect humans.

Although the vaccine-attributable risk of intussusception was considered very low in recent studies (<1/ 10,000), the recommendation for use of this vaccine in the USA was withdrawn in October 1999, and it was taken off the market by the manufacturer. 1 In the search for alternative vaccines, two further live attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines have been developed, with different underlying concepts.

They have now been licensed for sale in >100 countries, and in many of these universal mass vaccination (UMV) against rotavirus disease as part of childhood vaccination schemes has been initiated. In the USA, a distinct decline in clinic visits and hospital admissions for rotavirus disease has been noted. Clinical trials with the new vaccines in developing countries, where they are most needed, have shown a decreased efficacy in preventing severe rotavirus disease for reasons that are not clear; however, because of the high rotavirus-associated mortality in these countries, the WHO decided in 2009 to recommend rotavirus vaccination worldwide.",

For rotaviruses, a plasmid only-based, helper virus-free and fully tractable reverse genetics system has been developed (see Kanai et al in Further reading), which will open many new areas of basic and translational research, as happened for other RNA viruses when reverse genetics system became available.
