We previously generated an attenuated viral variant, YAC-MHV3, which induces a subclinical disease and recovery within 15 days. In contrast, the L2-MHV3 strain induces the development of a fulminant hepatitis, leading to death within 3 days. In this paper, we document intrahepatic and splenic T cell subpopulations involved in the hepatitis process and viral elimination identified in attenuated or pathogenic MHV3infected C57BL/6 mice. Percentages of intrahepatic CD4 \u0609 cells decreased in attenuated YAC-MHV3-infected mice, while they increased in mice infected with pathogenic L2-MHV3, compared with uninfected animals. Moreover, in YAC-MHV3-infected mice, the percentages of intrahepatic CD8 \u0609 cells slightly decreased at 24 h pi, then increased until 15 days pi. In contrast, the CD4/CD8 ratios of splenic lymphoid subpopulations increased in the first days of infection and returned to normal values at 15 days pi. Intrahepatic",

The pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice develop an acute hepatitis and die within 3 days. Within this time, progressive necrotic lesions can be observed in the liver, inducing dysfunction due to extensive necrosis (7) . Simultaneously, immune disorders occur in various lymphoid organs, leading to cellular and humoral immunodeficiences (7) (8) (9) (10) .

These T cells are characterized by an \u2423\u2424 \u03ea TCR of intermediate intensity (\u2423\u2424 \u03ea TCR inter ) and consist of double negative CD4 \u03ea CD8 \u03ea and single positive CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 cells (13, 14) . The percentage of single-positive CD4 \u03e9 cells is reported to be higher in the liver than in the spleen or thymus (14, 15) . Moreover, these lymphocytes express a higher level of leucocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) (14) , while some of them express the IL-2R\u2424 and PgP-1 (CD44) cell surface markers normally found on antigen-experienced T cells (12, 13, 16) . Some other \u2423\u2424 \u03ea TCR inter cell subsets express natural killer (NK)1.1 molecules and are defined as NK-T cells (17) . The protective role of these intrahepatic T cell subsets is contradictory. It has been demonstrated that intrahepatic \u2423\u2424 \u03ea TCR inter cells account for a protective mechanism in hepatic resistance to the early phase of murine salmonellosis (18) . In contrast, down-regulation of CD4 \u03e9 \u2423\u2424 \u03ea TCR inter cells favors the development of a protective immunity against listeriosis, and bacterial clearance has thus been mediated by cytotoxic CD8 \u03e9 cells (19, 20) . No information is available on the protective role of these cells in viral hepatitis.",

Studies with activation markers suggest that hepatic \u2423\u2424 \u03ea TCR inter LFA-1 high cells may be activated in situ during viral hepatitis but are not able to control the viral infection, suggesting that they are not protective against viral infection. Thus, the use of an attenuated virus that induces a subclinical infection without extensive hepatic lesions may be useful in elucidating the phenotype of the protective intrahepatic T cell subpopulations.",

The decrease of intrahepatic NK-T cell subsets in both groups of in-fected mice suggests that this cell subset does not play a major role in viral elimination. We have previously shown that intrahepatic CD4 \u03e9 TCR inter or high LFA-1 high increased in acute hepatitis induced by the pathogenic L2-MHV3 virus (21) . In this work, we demonstrated that, in attenuated YAC-MHV3-infected mice, intrahepatic CD4 \u03e9 TCR inter LFA-1 high cells transiently decreased. In addition, these cells were anergized, since the partial stimulation of intrahepatic lymphoid cells from YAC-MHV3-infected mice was mainly due to CD8 \u03e9 cells, rather than CD4 \u03e9 cell subsets. Such a phenomenon did not occur in the spleen, suggesting that a specific intrahepatic mechanism occurs in the first days of infection, leading to a blockade of the maturation process or induction of a suppressive state of intrahepatic CD4 \u03e9 TCR inter cells comparable to that seen in immune tolerance.",

            "text": "Immune tolerance may be due to the unresponsiveness of resident T lymphocytes despite antigen pre- sentation and activating cytokine production. The unresponsiveness of intrahepatic lymphocytes may result from several mechanisms. It has been proposed that an autocrine loop initiated by an interaction beween lymphocytes and Kupffer cells can cause CD4 \u03e9 activation and IFN-\u2425 production, which in turn may induce NO release by Kupffer cells to suppress T cell proliferation (23, 24) . Kupffer cells are an important target for pathogenic L2-MHV3 replication in the liver (25, 26) , suggesting that this proposed mechanism would be altered during viral infection. YAC-MHV3 replication was lower in macrophages than that produced by pathogenic L2-MHV3 infection (27) , suggesting that the tolerance, which is under control by Kupffer cells, would not be disturbed in YAC-MHV3-infected mice. Moreover, the production of IFN-\u2423\u2424, tumor necrosis factor-\u2423, or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by Kupffer cells could also be responsible for the decreased proliferative response of hepatic T cells (23, 24) . In vivo treatment of attenuated YAC-MHV3-infected mice with a PGE2 inhibitor, such as indomethacine, did not increase the hepatitis severity and percentages of intrahepatic activated CD4 \u03e9 TCR inter or high LFA-1 high cells (re-sults not shown), suggesting that suppression of those lymphocytes is not under the control of PGE2. In addition, NK-T cells are known to be high producers of IL-4, favoring the stimulation of Th2 cells and production of cytokines involved in suppression of the Th1 response, such as that seen in immune tolerance (28) . Since NK-T cells decreased in liver from both infected groups of mice, it is speculated that a decrease of Th2-dependent cytokines favors the activation of Th1 cells in both groups of infected mice. However, this mechanism may partially explain the activation of intrahepatic T cell subsets observed in L2-MHV3-infected mice (21) but cannot support the decrease of CD4 \u03e9 cell subsets in YAC-MHV3-infected mice. In addition, the CD4 \u03e9 belonging to the Th1 phenotype or NK cells can produce IFN-\u2425, which in turn is able to control viral replication. Preliminary in vitro experiments suggested that, in contrast to the L2-MHV3 virus, the YAC-MHV3 variant cannot replicate in the presence of IFN-\u2425.",

In addition, the number of leucocytes adhering to intrahepatic EC is controlled by a leucocyte-EC interactions and remains constant even if the total number or circulating leukocytes varies over time (30) . However, EC are an important target for pathogenic L2-MHV3 replication but not for attenuated viral strains (25, 26) . Other cytokines, such as IL-10 and prostanoids released by Kupffer cells, downregulate leukocyte adhesion to intrahepatic EC by decreasing surface expression of CD54 and CD116 (29) and then avoiding the recruitment of lymphoid cells and the immune-mediated liver damage by antigens from portal venous blood (31, 32) . Our observations concerning the numbers of intrahepatic lymphoid cells from attenuated YAC-MHV3-infected mice support the hypothesis that the integrity of intrahepatic EC is essential to avoid recrutment and/or activation of T lymphocytes involved in the hepatitis process.

It is speculated that suppression of CD4 \u03e9 TCR inter LFA-1 high cells, as seen in YAC-MHV3-infected mice, favors a down-regulation of ICAM-1 expression in hepatocytes in impairing production of cytokines by these cells, thus avoiding the binding of cytotoxic cells to hepatocytes. The decrease in T cells expressing high levels of LFA-1 would also be protective against destruction of the EC barrier by avoiding exposure of the underlying hepatocytes to further attack by cytotoxic cells. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that intrahepatic T cell subsets cannot be stimulated by mitogens and that intrahepatic lymphoid cells from attenuated YAC-MHV3-infected mice did not express activation markers, such as CD44 or CD45R (B220). This mechanism has been previouly demonstrated in the model of Con A-induced hepatitis in which the fulminant disease was mediated by activated CD4 \u03e9 lymphocytes following their contact with hepatocyte-bound Con A (33, 34) . In this situation, hepatic tolerance may be broken and tissue damages may result from the action of T cells activated by a liver microenvironment that has previously been conditioned by a microbial infection.",

Such a protective role of intrahepatic CD8 T cells has been reported in the hepatitis induced by Listeria monocytogenes, in which adoptive transfer of splenic CD4 \u03e9 T cells alone exacerbated the disease, while bacterial clearance was mediated by cytotoxic CD8 \u03e9 cells (35) . The percentage increase of intrahepatic CD8 \u03e9 T cells observed in the YAC-MHV3-infected mice may result either from an in situ stimulation of intrahepatic resident CD8 \u03e9 cells or from a recruitment of circulating lymphocytes. The fact that percentages of CD8 \u03e9 T cells transiently decreased in the liver while splenic CD8 \u03e9 cells increased indicates that a peripheral stimulation of splenic CD8 \u03e9 cells occurs before the increase of intrahepatic CD8 \u03e9 cells. The increase of intrahepatic T cells subsets expressing a lower level of LFA-1 antigen, such as that observed in splenic cells (14, 21) , suggests that intrahepatic CD8 \u03e9 cells are recruited from the blood. However, the recruitment of CD8 \u03e9 cells requires that there may be no major intrahepatic vascular disorders induced by the viral infection, such as demonstrated in pathogenic L2-MHV3 infection (36) . We can thus postulate that attenuated YAC-MHV3 infection in liver does not involve intravascular coagulation, as demonstrated by nonextensive pathological damages with perivascular lymphoid cells (8) , thus enabling the recruitment of circulating activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells. This hypothesis is also supported by the observation of lower levels of CD8 \u03e9 cells and the strong anergy observed in ex vivo lectin-stimulated intrahepatic lymphoid cells from L2-MHV3-infected mice.",
