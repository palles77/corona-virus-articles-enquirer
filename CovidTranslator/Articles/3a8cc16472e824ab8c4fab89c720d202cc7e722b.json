            "text": "A B S T R A C T Historically, diagnosis of enigmatic pulmonary disease after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) required lung biopsy, but recent advancements in diagnosis and therapy for respiratory infections have changed how clinicians approach pulmonary abnormalities. We examined temporal trends in the use of lung biopsy after HCT. We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent their first allogeneic HCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between the years to 2015 and subsequently underwent surgical lung biopsy for any reason. Lung biopsy between cohorts were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model with death and relapse considered competing risks. Of 1418 patients, 52 (3.7%) underwent 54 post-HCT surgical lung biopsies during 1993 to 1997 compared with 24 (2.1%) and 25 biopsies in the 2003 to 2007 cohort; 2 cases of surgical lung biopsies out of 786 HCT recipients occurred during the 2013 to 2015 cohort (.25%). The median time to biopsy post-HCT was 71.5 days (IQR, 31 to 89) for the early cohort and 97 days (IQR, 42 to 124) for the late cohort, for an overall biopsy incidence of .15 and .075 per 1000 patient days in the first year after HCT, respectively. Patients in the 2003 to 2007 cohort were less likely to undergo a lung biopsy (adjusted HR, .50; 95% CI, .29 to .83; P = .008) when compared with patients in the early cohort, but more patients in the early cohort underwent lung biopsy without antecedent bronchoscopy (25/54 [46%] versus 3/25 [12%], P = .005). Although infections were a more common finding at biopsy in the early cohort (35/1418 versus 8/1148, P < .001), the number of biopsies demonstrating noninfectious lesions was similar between the two cohorts (19/1418 versus 17/1148, P = .76). Fungal infections were the major infectious etiology in both cohorts (32/35 [91%] versus 5/8 [63%], P = .07), but there was a significant reduction in the number of Aspergillus species found at biopsy between the cohorts (30/54 versus 1/25, P < .001). A similar percentage underwent biopsy with therapeutic intent for invasive fungal disease in the 2 cohorts (8/54 [15%] versus 4/25 [16%]). Surgical evaluation of lung disease in HCT recipients significantly declined over a span of 2 decades. The decline from the years 1993 to 1997 compared with 2003 to 2007 was because of a reduction in the number of biopsies for post-transplant infections due to aspergillosis, which is temporally related to improved diagnostic testing by minimally invasive means and the increased use of empiric therapy with extended-spectrum azoles. This practice of primary nonsurgical diagnostic and treatment approaches to pulmonary disease post-HCT have continued, shown by low numbers of surgical biopsies over the last 3 years.",

            "text": "Pulmonary complications are frequently encountered in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and are due to a variety of infectious and noninfectious etiologies, many of which are indistinguishable by either symptoms or radiologic imaging. Because treatment options vary widely, misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate therapy, compromise recovery, and lead to excess morbidity and mortality. An aggressive diagnostic approach is essential for the accurate identification of pulmonary complications in these high-risk patients. Historically, the diagnostic approach of enigmatic lung disease after HCT often led to surgical lung biopsy [1, 2] . Surgical lung biopsy has the advantage of being diagnostic as well as therapeutic in some instances, particularly in focally invasive fungal infection. However, improved noninvasive diagnostic modalities for infections have allowed for early diagnosis and detection by less invasive fiberoptic bronchoscopy, thus obviating the need for surgery [3] [4] [5] . The emergence of broad-spectrum triazole antifungals and liposomal-lipid complex polyenes in the early 2000s [6, 7] have allowed for increased use of less toxic empiric therapy for patients with presumed fungal infections, further limiting the necessity of antecedent lung biopsy. Still, in many situations in which the diagnosis remains uncertain, lung biopsy remains the gold standard for achieving a diagnosis.",

The reduction in the number of Aspergillus species found at biopsy between the cohorts was significant (30/54 versus 1/25, P < .001).

The implementation of rapid detection of CMV from BAL fluid in 1988 [3] and preemptive treatment strategies with ganciclovir and foscarnet [17] have led to the decline in incidence and mortality of CMV pneumonia. In addition, major shifts in antifungal treatment and prevention [18] have improved outcomes. Accordingly, we postulated that clinical practices for the diagnosis of HCT-related pulmonary disease have evolved in tandem with recent improvements in diagnostic technologies and treatments aimed at major pulmonary infections. Examination of these practices can shed light into optimal standards of care for clinical practice in a contemporary era of HCT.",

In addition, although there was a corresponding increase in the proportion of noninfectious etiologies diagnosed by lung biopsy, the overall number of these cases relative to the total number of patients at risk did not change. The low numbers of surgical biopsies after transplantation in the past 3 years suggests further reduction in the need for surgical diagnosis. In the early cohort, aspergillosis was the most common infectious diagnosis as well as the most common diagnoses overall posttransplant, consistent with well-documented observations that aspergillosis is the most common pulmonary fungal infection affecting HCT patients [19] and that focal lung lesions that persist despite antibiotic therapy are usually fungal [14] . From 2003 to 2007 the decline appeared to be driven almost entirely by the drop in Aspergillus-related lung biopsy diagnoses. In addition, there was a shift to performing biopsies on radiographically multifocal and diffuse disease, often linked to primarily noninfectious diagnoses. Diffuse infiltrates after HCT were historically associated with CMV pneumonitis [2] , but this diagnosis is now rarely identified on lung biopsy, as confirmed by our data.",

The third-generation triazole antifungal agent voriconazole was approved for clinical use in 2002 and has subsequently become the first-line treatment against invasive aspergillosis [7] because of its tolerability, oral bioavailability, and data suggesting enhanced efficacy and an improved toxicity profile when compared with amphotericin B [20] . Other agents in this class, specifically posaconazole and now isavuconazole, have expanded options. Empiric use of voriconazole for suspicious radiographic lesions has become a widely accepted practice, and it is likely that increased use of these agents is directly related to a decrease in the number of biopsies performed. For diagnosis, the Platelia sandwich ELISA (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for galactomannan has been commercially available in the United States since 2003 for the rapid and noninvasive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Detection of galactomannan in BAL fluid is highly sensitive in HCT recipients and is more sensitive than serum galactomannan particularly in neutropenic patients [21] . Together, serum and BAL galactomannan diagnoses have increased our ability to identify Aspergillus [22] , allowing patients to receive highly effective therapy.",

Early diagnostic bronchoscopy is now recommended over empiric treatment in HCT recipients with evidence of specific pulmonary processes [23] and is likely to have higher yield when clinical suspicion of infection is high [24] . This shift in practice is illustrated by the increasing proportion of lung biopsy recipients who underwent an antecedent bronchoscopy with BAL in the late cohort compared with the early cohort. As a consequence, the cohort of patients who underwent surgical lung biopsy performed in the latter cohort are likely to be a highly selected group for whom empiric therapy with anti-infective agents did not improve the infiltrates, bronchoscopy did not yield a diagnosis, or surgery was performed for therapeutic intent. Most surgical procedures for fungal disease were performed for therapy of established Mucorales spp. infection, which were the most common invasive fungal disease in the late cohort.

The rarity of lung biopsy in the current cohort of 2013 to 2015 suggests that a BAL that does not identify an infectious etiology may be sufficient for a clinician to begin empiric therapy for a presumptive infection or for a noninfectious pulmonary complication. Of note, there were no transbronchial biopsies in the post-HCT time frame in our cohort.

In situations when clinical judgment is equivocal and less invasive means are uninformative, surgical biopsy should be considered. We propose an algorithm to aid in the workup of pulmonary abnormalities after HCT, shown in Figure 2 . This reflects the current practice at our institution and is consistent with studies investigating the yield of BAL and lung biopsy in this population [24] . Although this algorithm is based on radiographic patterns, the clinical context and clinical suspicion for a specific diagnosis and clinical feasibility of performing bronchoscopy (ie, patient characteristics, location and size of the lesion) will dictate the diagnostic workup and/or empiric management. Voriconazole is generally chosen as the first-line empiric therapy in cases of pulmonary nodules because of the frequency of aspergillosis and availability and ease of administration of the drug. Newer tablet formulations of posaconazole, which has improved bioavailability and activity against some Mucorales spp., may also be considered as an option for empiric therapy.",

Diagnostic practices in the evaluation of lung disease and use of empiric antifungals for pulmonary nodules vary from institution to institution, given the availability of specific tests, frequency of bronchoscopy, and medical practitioners who have experience in performing lung biopsy on this specialized population of immunocompromised patients. This study reflects a large academic center with a highvolume HCT practice, pulmonary services with experience with BAL in HCT, and with availability of center-specific microbiologic tests such as fungal PCR. The utilization of surgical lung biopsy observed in this study may not be applicable to clinical practice settings in which the experience with HCT is limited and those where surgical lung biopsy may be the primary means of achieving a diagnosis. In addition, this diagnostic algorithm presented must also be taken into context with local diagnostic testing options and geographic fungal epidemiology patterns. As is the case with any endpoint that rests on a clinical decision, the results may be simply based on the biases of the physician or group of physicians encountered by the patient.",

As a consequence of improved outcomes from aspergillosis, the burden of pulmonary pathology has shifted to late noninfectious complications, which is an area of unmet need in this population. Additionally, nodules due to invasive fungal disease and unresponsive to empiric therapy are largely caused by non-Aspergillus species. These observations suggest a need for further investigation into minimally invasive means of diagnosing noninfectious pulmonary complications, improved diagnostic tools, and more efficacious treatment for these important late pulmonary complications after HCT.",
