Armed with this critical information and insight into the structural requirements for high affinity binding to HRV-14, researchers soon discovered the lead compound WIN 51711 (Disoxaril 1, Otto et al., 1985) and proposed a mechanism of action based on inhibition of virus replication by prevention of viral uncoating. Subsequently, an even broader spectrum antiviral agent, WIN 54954 (2), emerged from an intense program that involved screening a library of diverse analogues (Diana et al., 1989) .",

After this time, labile tritium was removed by several evaporations of ethanol, yielding crude product (18.5 GBq) in 10 ml of ethanol. Purification was accomplished by reverse phase HPLC eluted with aqueous 20 mmol triethylammonium acetate (pH 7):methanol (30:70) affording 3.7 GBq (a 6% radiochemical yield based on precursor 3) of tritiated product 4, which was >98% radiochemically pure and completely co-chromatographed with unlabelled 2 on TLC (hexane:acetone (5:1)) and reverse phase HPLC (same system as above). The specific activity of 4 was determined to be 2 TBq/mmol by UV(ethanol) assay where E 255 =12,370 for 2, and its UV spectrum was superimposable on that of 2. Product 4 also provided a proton decoupled tritium NMR (CD 3 OD), as seen in Fig. 1 , showing exclusive aliphatic chain tritium incorporation.",

The scale and other practical considerations ruled out a simple mimic of the unlabelled synthesis (Diana et al., 1989 ) employing tritiated components. Ideally, a penultimate precursor, converted in an efficient single step tritiation to the desired product, would be most inviting. In fact, olefin precursor 3 had been reported (Mallamo et al., 1992) during the course of a study exploring the stereochemical requirements of the hydrophobic binding pocket. Catalytic olefin reduction with tritium has been very successful in preparing high specific activity radioligands, but heterogeneous catalyst could not be used because of the likely potential of dechlorination as well as isoxazole ring cleavage.",

Catalytic tritiation of 3 with Wilkinson's catalyst afforded, after HPLC purification, radiochemically pure product 4 at 2 TBq/mmol by UV assay. A tritium NMR spectrum (Fig. 1) provided a convincing proof that the tritium incorporation was exclusively in the stable alkyl chain methylenes as indicated, and its characteristic doublet of doublets pattern corroborated the high specific activity as measured by UV. The tritium NMR also disclosed that little, if any, scrambling of the label into the other methylenes had occurred. Carried out several times on precursor 3, this method proved to be robust, yielding pure 4 in excess of 1.9 TBq/mmol each time. Antiviral radioligand 4 has proven extremely useful to screen and identify other further optimized antiviral candidates (Fox et al., 1991) .",
