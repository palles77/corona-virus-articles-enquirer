Up to 9th of February 2020, at least 37, 251 cases have been reported 25 with 812 fatal cases according to the report from China CDC. However, the immune 26 mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from patients of 2019-nCoV is still 27 unknown. Here we show that after the 2019-nCoV infection, CD4 + T lymphocytes are rapidly 28 activated to become pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM-CSF etc. The cytokines 29 environment induces inflammatory CD14 + CD16 + monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and 30 accelerates the inflammation. These aberrant and excessive immune cells may enter the 31 pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung 32 functional disability and quick mortality. Our results demonstrate that excessive non-effective 33 host immune responses by pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes may associate 34 with severe lung pathology. Therefore, we suggest that monoclonal antibody that targets the 35 GM-CSF or interleukin 6 receptor may potentially curb immunopathology caused by 36 2019-nCoV and consequently win more time for virus clearance. with 2019-nCoV, that have been reported recently, have increased plasma concentrations of 44 2 inflammation related cytokines, including interleukins (IL) 2, 7, and 10, granulocyte-colony 45 stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-\uf067-inducible protein 10 (IP10), monocyte 46 chemoattractant protein 1(MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1A), and 47 tumour necrosis factor \uf061 (TNF-\uf061), especially in moribund patients 10 . Importantly, 2019-nCoV 48 infected patients have developed characteristic pulmonary ground glass changes on imaging 49 and lymphocytes decreasing 11,12 . These phenomena suggest severe pulmonary inflammation 50 and cytokine storm also exist in 2019-nCoV infection. At present, symptomatic treatments 51 with organ support to moribund patients are the mainstays of clinical managements. It is 52 urgent to identify the immunopathology mechanism to delay the pulmonary immune injury. 53 54",

            "text": "In patients infected with SARS-CoV, it has been reported that the severity of pulmonary 55 immune injury correlated with extensive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in the 56 lungs 13,14 , accompanied with increased numbers of neutrophils and monocytes and lower 57 CD8 + and CD4 + T cell counts in the peripheral blood samples [15] [16] [17] The number of T cells also significantly decreased from both ICU and non-ICU patients. The To demonstrate the status of these aberrant altered T cells, several lymphoid antigens have 76 been analyzed on T cells. These CD4 + T cells in patients infected with 2019-nCoV have 77 higher expression of CD69, CD38, and CD44 compared with healthy controls (Fig.1a, b) , 78 indicating their activated status. OX40 have been reported to play a major role in promoting 79 clonal expansion and inducing production of several cytokines in T cells 19 . In patients 80 infected with 2019-nCoV, OX40 expression increased remarkably on CD4 + T cells, especially 81 in severe ICU patients (Fig.1a, b) . CD8 + T cells in patients infected with 2019-nCoV also 82 showed activated phenotype with higher expression of CD69, CD38 and CD44 (Fig.1c, d) . 83 41BB (CD137; TNFRS9) is an activation-induced co-stimulatory molecule, which is 84 important to priming immune responses of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells 20 . In ICU patients infected 85 with 2019-nCoV, the expression of 41BB increased significantly compared to healthy controls 86 (Fig.1c, d) . It has been reported that co-expression of Tim-3 and PD-1 may represent a subset 87 of T cells with more severe exhaustion in virus infections 21, 22 . It is worth noting that much 88 3 higher percentage of co-expression Tim3 + PD-1 + T subset exist both in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells 89 from patients of 2019-nCoV ( Fig.1e- To further identify the key pathogenic cytokines and the main source of these cytokines, 93 interferon-\uf067 (IFN\uf067), TNF-\uf061, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 94 and IL-6 have been selected to analyzed through intracellular cytokine staining, for these 95 inflammatory mediators have been proven to be critical as the primary cause of inflammatory 96 cytokine storm in patients infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV 23,24 . Without 97 re-stimulation with PMA or incubation with monensin, high percentage of GM-CSF + and 98 IL-6 + expressions could been found in CD4 + T cells from patients infected with 2019-nCoV in 99 both ICU and non-ICU patients compared to healthy controls (Fig.2a, c) . ICU patients with 100 more severe pneumonia showed correlated higher percentage of GM-CSF + and IL-6 + CD4 + T 101 cells (Fig.2a, GM-CSF has been recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and 114 autoimmune diseases, in a mechanism that controls diverse pathogenic capabilities of 115 inflammatory myeloid cells. Among these myeloid cells, monocyte is the pathogenic GM-CSF 116 responsive cells that require GM-CSF to initiate tissue damage in both mouse and human 26,27 . 117 To identify whether inflammatory monocyte exist in patients infected 2019-nCoV, phenotype 118 and subpopulation of monocytes have been analysis. There was little CD14 + CD16 + 119 inflammatory monocyte subset in healthy controls. By contrast, significant higher percentage 120 of CD14 + CD16 + inflammatory monocyte exist in peripheral blood of patient infected 121 2019-nCoV. The percentage of CD14 + CD16 + monocyte was much higher in severe pulmonary 122 syndrome patients from ICU (Fig.3a, c) . Moreover, these monocyte from patients infected 123 2019-nCoV also showed capability to secrete GM-CSF. Importantly, significantly higher 124 expression of IL-6 secreted from these inflammatory monocyte especially in ICU patients, 125 which let the cytokine storm even worse (Fig.3b, d) . Meanwhile, the number of GM-CSF + 126 monocytes and IL-6 + monocytes increased rapidly (Fig.3e) , suggesting the potential high risk 127 of inflammatory cytokine storm caused by monocytes that may migrate to the lung and 128 further derive into macrophage or monocyte derived dendritic cells. Thus, in patients infected 129 with 2019-nCoV, GM-CSF potentially links the severe pulmonary syndrome-initiating 130 capacity of pathogenic Th1 cells (GM-CSF + IFN\uf067 + ) with the inflammatory signature of 131 monocytes (CD14 + CD16 + with high expression of IL-6) and their progeny.

Consistent with 139 the situation with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV 12,28 , it is remarkable that children always 140 experience mild-moderate clinical illness, elderly individuals exhibit worse outcomes after 141 infection with 2019-nCoV, further indicating that mature excessive immune response towards 142 these pathogenic human coronavirus infections play a key role in inducing severe pulmonary 143 syndrome and even organ failure. However, many urgent questions remain to be answered. 144 Evidence from alveolar washing fluid and lung autopsy from patients infected 2019-nCoV are 145 further needed to verify whether and how these aberrant pathogenic immune cells play a fatal 146 immune damage to cause organ functional disability and mortality. Specific new drugs 147 targeted 2019-nCoV may take long time to evaluate and develop. At this critical moment, 148 several marketed drugs to target cytokine storm and reduce immunopathology could be 149 considered 29 . Blocking inflammatory cytokines may temporarily weaken the anti-infection 150 immunity, yet such strategy is already the lesser of the evils.
