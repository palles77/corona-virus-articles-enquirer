Participation degree of sulfur atom on the sugar ring seems like depending on electron density on the sugar ring, ring strain of the generated episulfonium cation, and properties of nucleophile and leaving group. Mitsunobu reaction of fluorinated compounds (10 and 12) with benzoic acid or nucleobases might have difficulty in forming episulfonium cation because the sugar ring is already electron-poor by electron-withdrawing fluoro group. Therefore, the major product was single inverted one (11, 13, 14, and 18 ). On the other hand, in case of DAST reaction of compound 8 there is no strong electron-withdrawing group such as a fluorine atom on the sugar ring, implying that participation of the sulfur atom is expected and the major product is double inverted one (9). The remaining things are conversion of 6chloropurine into adenine base and desilylation of TBDPS group in sequence. Surprisingly, treatment of compound 18 with methanolic ammonia at 80\u00b0C overnight accomplished not only amination at 6-position of 6-chloropurine base but also desilylation of TBDPS group, giving the final product 4 in 68% yield.",

However, selectivity index (SI) of 3 showed low value of 1.56 due to its high cytotoxicity (CC 50 = 14 .54 lg/mL) in HeLa cell. It is very interesting that cytosine nucleoside analogue 3 designed as a bioisostere of lamivudine showed anti-VSV activity instead of the expected anti-HIV activity. Considering that VSV belongs to RNA virus, it is worthy to note that 3 classified into ddNs exhibited potent anti-VSV activity. Antiviral evaluation of compounds 1-4 was also performed against FluA (influenza virus type A) (H1N1) strain Taiwan, FluA (H3N2) strain Johannesburg, FCV (Feline coronavirus) strain WSU, and FIP (Feline infectious peritonitis virus) strain WSU, but all compounds did not show antiviral activity and cytotoxicity up to 100 lg/mL (not shown in Table 1 ).",

This observation implies that iso-D D-2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxy sugar templates might act as a sugar surrogate of nucleosides for the development of anti-RNA virus agent.
