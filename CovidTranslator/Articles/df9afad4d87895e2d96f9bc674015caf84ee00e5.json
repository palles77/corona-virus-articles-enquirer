Currently anti-TNF-\u2423 drugs (e.g. etanercept) are used in humans for treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study we aimed to elucidate the role of TNF-\u2423 in the development of virus-endotoxin-induced respiratory disease. Twenty-two caesarean derived colostrum deprived pigs were used. Initially, the availability in the lungs and circulation, and possible clinical and inflammatory effects of etanercept alone were assessed in 4 pigs after intratracheal and intraperitoneal administration of 0.5 mg/per route/per pig. High anti-TNF-\u2423 activity was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, peritoneal lavage fluids and serum of all animals for at least 8 h post-inoculation (HPI). No clinical symptoms, lung lesions, lung cell infiltration or induction of IFN-\u2423, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-\u2423 in BAL were detected. Subsequently, the ability of etanercept to block porcine TNF-\u2423 and its effect on the above mentioned parameters and on lung virus titres were assessed in 8 pigs. They were inoculated intratracheally with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24 h later. Etanercept was administered at the time of LPS inoculation via the same routes and dose as in the initial experiment. The parameters were compared with a control group (n = 8), receiving only PRCV-LPS. Half of the animals from each group were euthanized at 4 and the rest at 8 h after LPS inoculation. TNF-\u2423 was completely neutralized in 3 of the 4 animals euthanized at 4 HPI and significantly lower than in the PRCV-LPS group at all times. No significant differences in disease severity, lung lesions, virus replication, lung cell infiltration or levels of IFN-\u2423, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12/IL-23 were observed between the two groups. Blocking of TNF-\u2423 alone was not sufficient to ameliorate disease in the PRCV-LPS model of respiratory disease, possibly due to the redundancy in the proinflammatory cytokine cascade, or the involvement of other unidentified disease mediators.",

            "text": "Tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF-\u2423) is a proinflammatory cytokine, which is secreted by many cell types in the earliest stages of inflammation. It is an essential fac-tor mediating the immune responses against infections. However, it also plays an important role in the induction of septic shock, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. TNF-\u2423 has become a major therapeutic target in the treatment of many cutaneous and systemic inflammatory diseases, such as moderate and severe psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis (reviewed by Jackson, 2007) . The currently existing drugs that are used to inhibit TNF-\u2423-mediated pathology in humans are based on 2 dif-ferent mechanisms of action: (1) the naturally existing TNF-receptor, which binds TNF and mediates its further biological activities (etanercept) or (2) recombinant anti-TNF-\u2423 monoclonal antibodies (infliximab, adalimumab) which bind and neutralize specifically human TNF-\u2423. Etanercept represents a fusion protein which consists of the extracellular ligand-binding portion of the human 75 kDa TNF-receptor (TNFR) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1 antibody (see http://www.enbrel.com/prescribinginformation.jsp -accessed on 11 August 2009). Thus, it binds to soluble (active form), but not membrane bound (inactive form) TNF-\u2423, and renders it biologically inactive. Adalimumab and infliximab, on the other hand, bind specifically to both soluble and membrane bound TNF-\u2423 (reviewed by Jackson, 2007) .",

In the study of Van Reeth et al. (2000) TNF-\u2423 was assumed to be a potential culprit for the observed clinical synergy since a temporal association was observed between the peak of clinical symptoms (high fever, depression and breathing difficulties) and production of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u2423 in particular, in the lungs of the dually inoculated animals. In contrast, pigs inoculated with PRCV or LPS only did not exhibit prominent respiratory symptoms and had minimal or no cytokine production in the lungs. In the current study we aimed to elucidate the role of TNF-\u2423 in the PRCV-LPS model of respiratory disease, by blocking TNF-\u2423 in the lungs of PRCV-LPS inoculated pigs.",

Before the start of the assay the cells were pre-treated for 2 h at 40 \u2022 C with the transcriptional inhibitor Actinomycin D to become more sensitive to the effects of TNF-\u2423. Meanwhile two-fold dilutions of the examined samples were mixed with 10 U of a laboratory standard solution of recombinant porcine TNF-\u2423 for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C allowing the residual etanercept in the samples to bind to the standard and neutralize its activity. After the cell-sensitisation the pretreated sample dilutions were brought on the PK15 cells and were further incubated for 18 h at 40 \u2022 C. The degree of cytotoxicity was measured via staining with crystal violet solution, washing and dissolving in 33% acetic acid. The optical density of the sample dilutions was measured at 550 nm wave length, using an ELISA reader. The titre of Enbrel \u00ae in neutralizing units (NU) was determined as the reverse of the dilution at which the effect of the TNF-\u2423 standard was neutralized at 50%. The detection limit of the assay was 80 NU/ml. Each sample was tested at least 3 times and geometric means were calculated. Internal controls were run in each test.",

            "text": "In this study we aimed to elucidate the role of TNF-\u2423 in the development of clinical symptoms in virus-endotoxininduced respiratory disease. A well established and reproducible model of such disease is the PRCV-LPS inoculation in pigs. When administered intratracheally at the time of LPS inoculation, Enbrel \u00ae was able to successfully block porcine TNF-\u2423 produced in the lungs. To our knowledge this is the first in vivo study which shows direct blocking of TNF-\u2423 in the lungs of pigs by etanercept (Enbrel \u00ae ). Another anti-TNF-\u2423 agent (infliximab, Remicade \u00ae ) has been shown to effectively attenuate the decrease in myocardial function after cardiac arrest (simulated by coronary occlusion) in pigs, though plasma levels of TNF-\u2423 between infliximab-treated and mockinoculated animals did not differ significantly (as measured by means of ELISA) (Niemann et al., 2009) . This difference in results may partially be explained by the difference in the mechanisms of function and the biochemical nature of infliximab (see http://www.rxlist.com/remicade-drug. htm#cp -accessed on 23 August 2009) and etanercept (see http://www.enbrel.com/prescribinginformation.jsp -accessed on 11 August 2009). Etanercept has previously been shown to reduce endotoxin-induced pulmonary hypertension in pigs (Mutschler et al., 2006) , but TNF-\u2423 levels in the lungs were not determined in that study. Moreover, clinical symptoms were also not determined since the animals were under inhalation anaesthesia during the experiment. Successful TNF-\u2423 blocking by etanercept has so far only been documented in laboratory animals like rats (Di Paola et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008) and mice (Fries et al., 2008) , though biological activity was not determined in any of the above mentioned studies. Comparison of our data with the results of these studies, however, is difficult not only because of the use of different TNF-\u2423 measurement techniques such as Western blot-analysis and immunohistochemistry on tissues (Di Paola et al., 2007) or anti-TNF-\u2423 ELISA (Fries et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008) , but also because of the difference in animal models, disease models and routes of administration of etanercept. In the study of Zhang et al. TNF-\u2423 levels in BAL fluids did not differ between etanercept-treated and sham-treated groups, although TNF-\u2423 in serum was blocked. This difference can be partially explained by the fact that subcutaneous administration of etanercept may fail to result in sufficient concentrations of the drug in the lungs. During pneumonia, cytokines are produced locally, at the site of infection (reviewed in Schultz et al., 1999) . In previous studies in our laboratory we have also noticed that TNF-\u2423 production during PRCV-LPS-induced lung inflammation remains very local and no or minimal detection of TNF-\u2423 in serum was observed (unpublished data). However, to make sure that systemic TNF-\u2423 does not interfere with the observed clinical symptoms we administered etanercept also intraperitoneally. High residual anti-TNF-\u2423 activity was detected in the serum of the Enbrel-only inoculated group in comparison with the mock-inoculated group, which confirms the availability of Enbrel \u00ae in the circulation.",

There are many contradicting reports of the effect of anti-TNF-\u2423 therapy on disease severity and outcome. In humans anti-TNF-\u2423 therapy has shown also no or very little beneficial effect for pulmonary diseases, though in animal models it has shown various levels of success (reviewed in Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006) . The criteria for clinical examination, however, are very different in the different studies, and therefore a correct comparison is usually not possible. The physiology of pigs is more similar to that of humans than that of other animal models, such as mice and rats. Therefore pig research is becoming increasingly important.",

In the above mentioned study with rats (Zhang et al., 2008 ) also a reduction in the severity of lung histopathological lesions was observed after etanercept treatment.

This is in contrast with most recent studies in other animal models. For example, in a study of the effect of intraperitoneal administration of etaner-cept on ventilator-induced lung injury in mice, Wolthuis et al. (2009) observed attenuated neutrophil influx and significant reduction in pulmonary levels of IL-6, MIP-2 and keratinocyte chemoattractant in etanercept-treated animals versus placebo, though blocking of TNF-\u2423 was not measured by this group. In the above mentioned study of Zhang et al. (2008) reduced neutrophil infiltration after etanercept administration in passive smoking rats was also observed. Marked reduction of local mucosal neutrophil infiltration in mice with ulcerative colitis (Popivanova et al., 2008) and rats with periodontitis (Di Paola et al., 2007) has also been shown. These differences with our results, may be attributed to the differences in the experimental designs, disease-and animal models used in these studies, as well as to possible secretion or inhibition of other chemotactic cytokines, which have not been examined here. Furthermore, though the PRCV-LPS model of respiratory disease is quite reproducible and has long been used in our lab-oratory, it represents a complex model of virus-bacterial disease, in which many aspects of the pathogenic mechanisms even of the single agents are not yet well elucidated, and the mechanism of the combination of these pathogenic agents is even less well understood.",

TNF-\u2423 reduction, however, was not associated with decrease in disease severity, bronchoalveolar neutrophil infiltration, or altered virus replication and induction of IL-1, IL-6, IL-12/IL-23 or IFN-\u2423 in the lungs. There was no obvious difference in macroscopic lung lesions and histopathological findings in the lungs. This data confirms the generally accepted belief that TNF-\u2423, though very important, is not the sole culprit in development of respiratory disease and pathology, and possibly other, yet unidentified, components and mechanisms of the immune system are involved. Complication of respiratory viral infections with secondary bacterial infections and vice versa is very commonly found in field conditions in animals and in humans. Yet, experimental studies of complex diseases are still rare and relatively difficult to reproduce. Therefore, our study is an important addition to the general knowledge about complex virus-bacterial infections and their pathogenic mechanisms, though the exact mechanisms remain still obscure.",
