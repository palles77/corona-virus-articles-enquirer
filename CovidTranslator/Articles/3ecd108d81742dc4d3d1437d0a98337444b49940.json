This review focuses on perinatal outcomes following URTI during pregnancy. Few data exist on the explicit topic of URTI and adverse perinatal outcomes. The entire URTI burden among pregnant women is not properly represented by the studies included in this review, because only those infections severe enough to warrant hospitalization have been studied. Most probably, the number of URTIs in pregnant women not requiring hospitalization is far larger, but this has yet to be quantified. Clearly, there are logistical barriers to obtaining such statistics. Severe URTI requiring hospitalization during pregnancy was noted to be associated with adverse perinatal complications. URTI was found to be positively correlated with preterm delivery (PTD; less than 37 weeks gestation), lower birth weight, and cesarean deliveries, without a significant effect on the rates of perinatal mortality or low Apgar scores. There appears to be a possible link between various infectious processes that occur during pregnancy and the outcome of a PTD. The inflammatory environment present during infection includes high levels of cytokines that are known to increase prostaglandins, which, in turn, can induce preterm birth. Further studies should evaluate whether URTI not requiring hospitalization has any effect on perinatal outcomes.",

The common cold is the number one reason for doctor visits in the United States [1] . On average, healthy adults will experience between two and four URTIs every year, which last from 7 to 14 days each [1] . The most common etiologies are rhinovirus, coronavirus, and adenovirus; however, these entities are clinically indistinguishable, and a specific virologic diagnosis does not alter medical management [1, 2] .",

This leads to a decrease in the functional residual capacity and residual volume. There is a transition from abdominal to thoracic breathing and an increase in minute ventilation, resulting in a mild respiratory alkalosis, which allows for better gas exchange across the placenta [3] . When a pregnant woman experiences a respiratory infection, the fetus can be negatively impacted due to its unique sensitivity to hypoxemia and acidosis. This dangerous combination has been shown to stimulate preterm labor in the second half of pregnancy [4] . Additionally, there is an increase in oxygen requirement and critical closing volume, which, in conjunction, make respiratory disease more severe in pregnancy [4] .",

The Th1 response is a pathway of pathogen removal involving T-helper cells, macrophages, and B-cells. In a general sense, T cells produce a chemical called interferon-gamma, which excites macrophages, turning on their bactericidal properties. Simultaneously, B-cells are also activated, and they begin to make cell-coating antibodies. Together, the tagging of the pathogen by B-cell's antibodies and the bactericidal instincts of the macrophages lead to pathogen removal, if all goes according to plan.",

Pregnant women have been noted to have an impaired immune response to multiple viruses; among them are many causes of URTIs, such as influenza, cytomegalovirus, and streptococcal organisms [6] . It is postulated that the proinflammatory environment of infection-specifically, the cytokines and microbial endotoxins that induce prostaglandin production and matrixdegrading enzymes-can contribute to preterm labor [7] . URTI can be complicated by pneumonia, a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Pneumonia is usually caused by bacterial infection, unlike URTI. However, LRTI can follow a viral URTI (e.g., Group A streptococcal pneumonia may follow influenza) [1] . LRTI carries a much greater risk in pregnancy than does URTI. There is a much higher chance of hypoxemia and acidosis due to the severity and depth of the infection. Pregnant women with pneumonia are at risk for various medical complications, such as meningitis, pericarditis, empyema, and endocarditis. Therefore, pregnant women with pneumonia are usually hospitalized and monitored. Pneumonia has been linked to low birth weight, fetal distress, and preterm birth [8, 9] .",

Pregnant women are highly affected by influenza, and even the yearly H1N1 influenza strains of less virulence have historically resulted in higher mortality and morbidity in the pregnant population [9] . The results from the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) published by Pierce et al. show that H1N1 infection in pregnant women requiring hospitalization was also linked to an increased rate of PTDs [15] .

This analysis also revealed a relationship between pneumonia and PTD. In a multivariable model controlling for IUGR, placental abruption, and preeclampsia, pneumonia was found to be an independent risk factor for PTD (OR=5.4, 95 % CI 3.8-7.7, p<.001). However, pneumonia was not found to be an independent risk factor for perinatal mortality [8] . Using the same population (from Beer Sheva, Israel), an additional study was performed by Gershovitz et al., which investigated the population of women who had undergone splenectomy in this same time period and then become pregnant [16] . This investigation found that splenectomy was an independent risk factor for PTD (OR=2.1, 95 % CI 1.4-3.3, p<.001) [16] . An additional study conducted with the same cohort investigated pyelonephritis and pregnancy [17] . In this study by Farkash et al., it was found that pyelonephritis was an independent risk factor for PTD (OR=2.6; 95 % CI 1.7-3.9, p<.001) [17] .",

One potential way to lower the burden of URTI, which may, in turn, lower the incidence of PTD, is through use of the influenza vaccine. This vaccine is not currently well utilized by the pregnant population. The American College of Gynecology and Obstetrics (ACOG) and the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend universal vaccination for pregnant women at all gestational ages [19] . However, currently, only 13 %-34 % of pregnant women are vaccinated [20] .

Subsequently, they further elucidated the role of the complement system, a component of the innate immune system responsible for assisting phagocytic cells in identifying and eliminating pathogens. Complement activation occurs uniquely in preterm labor, and not in the process of normal term labor and delivery [22] . This finding suggests that the inflammatory state present in preterm labor and delivery is potentially the catalyst that triggers cervical ripening preterm and allows for preterm labor to occur.

Primarily, it is believed that cervical shortening can progress and lead to eventual cervical funneling, which is often, but not always, followed by preterm labor itself. However, as of late, Kim et al. have brought into question whether or not cervical changes are necessary for preterm birth to occur. They have questioned the medical criteria necessary for a diagnosis of preterm labor. The suspicions are based upon the fact that when sampling amniotic fluid of women who have preterm contractions, but not cervical change, it is noted that the women who had culture-confirmed infection had elevated rates of PTD and overall morbidity [24] . This observation led to questioning the belief that cervical change is a necessary process in the early stages of preterm labor and, when quantified, can predict rates of PTD. This sparked further investigation into the inflammatory states present in pregnancies with poor outcomes.",

One of the changes that occur in pregnancy is a reduction in the immune response, particularly in regard to cell-mediated immunity and the Th1 response [4, 6] . It is thought that this change is one of the ways in which the body prevents a graft-versus-fetus response in the mother. However, when the immune system remains robust in this regard, one of the possible results is a condition referred to as chronic chorioamnionitis. This is a condition defined by a pathology report postdelivery that shows a lymphocytic infiltration of the chorioamniotic membranes. In the research of Lee et al., chronic chorioamnionitis was found in more than one third of spontaneous PTDs [25] . This inflammatory lesion, along with vilitis of the placenta of unknown etiology, has been found to resemble allograft rejection and graft-versus-host disease of the fetus in their immunologic markers [25] . Thus, the inflammatory environment referred to as a precursor of preterm labor and delivery may be intimately related to chronic chorioamnionitis. It would be beneficial to understand the differences between the conditions leading to chronic chorioamnionitis, which causes PTD, and the infections that lead to PTD. Perhaps the changes in the immune system (or lack thereof) that lead to chronic chorioamnionitis are related to the susceptibility to certain infections, which additionally increase the likelihood of preterm labor and delivery.",
