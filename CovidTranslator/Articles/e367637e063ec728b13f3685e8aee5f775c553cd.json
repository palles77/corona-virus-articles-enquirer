Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts .

Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r 2 >0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.",

This new virus has some relations to SARS-CoV but it is more aggressive than SARS, MERS, or the seasonal influenza 2 . It has exhibited relatively high human-to-human transmissibility compared to other coronavirus infections 3 To predict epidemic trend, meteorological conditions are suggested to be an important factor as well as population mobility and human-to-human contact. These meteorological factors such as humidity, visibility, and wind speed can affect droplet stability in the environment, or affect survival of viruses as air temperature does, and thus impact epidemic transmission. Air temperature and absolute humidity have been indicated to significantly influence the transmission of COVID-19. However, there are only five studies published on preprint hubs discussed the involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of COVID-19 up to now, and they all focused on data from China without model validation or prediction.",

Four time points delay of the weather conditions from the day of epidemic situation evaluation were considered and compared to find the most possible time delay that best reveals the relationship between weather and COVID-19 outbreak. A multivariate polynomial regression model with factors of wind speed, relative humidity, and average air temperature was established, and then validated in 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world.

At first, each meteorological variable was plotted against the confirmed new case counts for the Wuhan dataset, with four time delays display on one plot. Only one city Wuhan was chosen for illustrating the time delay effect because it is the original city where SARS-CoV2 was first uncovered, there could not be any imported cases for Wuhan, which might obscure the correlation between weather and virus transmission. A Loess regression interpolation approach was adopted to visually identify the relationship between meteorological variables and confirmed new case counts. After choosing the appropriate time delay, data from the discovery dataset were fitted into generalized linear model or non-linear model (basically polynomial and inverse models) according to the indentified relationship by Loess regression. Each of the four meteorological variables was fitted into models solely, and then two or three variables were combined together to fit complex models.",

The confirmed new cases in Wuhan on February 13, 2020, reached 13,436, which was oddly high as the daily confirmed new cases were no larger than 3,000 on all the other dates in Wuhan or in all the other cities. We suppose that it might be due to supplement of enough virus test kits on that day. In order to reduce the potential contamination of modeling by this outlier, we substituted the counts on that day by four, that was 13,436/4=3,359, which was still the largest number but not deviated from the dataset too much.

Temperature and wind speed were fitted into quadratic models; relative humidity was fitted into a cubic model; visibility was fitted into two models, an inverse model when modeling in the discovery dataset and a quadratic model when modeling in the Wuhan dataset because distribution of visibility in the two datasets was different. We used these fitted models to calculate a predicted value for case counts for each studied site, and then compared this predicted value with the real observed case counts by calculating a Pearson's correlation coefficient between them. Model fitting results showed that using the Wuhan dataset for single-factor modeling produced better model fitness. There was 0.40, 0.24, and 0.35 correlation between the observed data for Wuhan and values predicted by average air temperature, relative humidity, and visibility, separately, while wind speed alone could not explain much of the variance in confirmed case counts ( Figure 4 ). According to the equation, SARS-CoV2 transmission reaches a peak when the air temperature is 8.07 \u2103, or when the wind speed is 16.1 mile/hr, or when the visibility is 2.99 statute miles to nearest tenth, or when the relative humidity is 64.6%.",

As of March 14 in 2020, the reported confirmed case counts reached 81,026 in China and 62,205 in other countries around the world, and it caused 5388 reported deaths globally 4 . Although Wuhan, the Chinese city where SARS-CoV2 was originally discovered, has shut down since January 23 and China has taken very strict control measures on population flow all over the country, population movements has begun in the early January of 2020 or even earlier in December 2019. Therefore, even if the outbreak of COVID-19 in China showed a trend of being controlled, the outbreak around the world is still an important public health problem, and if not well dealt, it could even lead to worldwide economic crisis. For government decision making, it is helpful to know the prediction of the future trend of COVID-19 outbreak ahead.",

DISCUSSION Significant impact of different temperature exposure on the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 has been reported by a few studies, absolute humidity has also been related to human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. However, there is currently no systematic and quantitative research investigating the exact impact of a set of meteorological factors on the spread rate of COVID-19. Our study suggests that changes in a single weather factor, such as temperature or humidity, could not correlate with the case counts very well. On the other hand, several meteorological factors combined together could describe the epidemic trend much better than single-factor models. Our research also finds that there exists nonlinear dose-response relationship for all the four meteorological factors, in consistency with previous studies about climate and epidemics. Predictions of COVID-19 outbreak scale by the models were well correlated with the observations, suggesting an important role of weather in the transmission of SARS-CoV2 all over the world.The impact of weather on the spread of plague has been discussed early in human's history. The ancient Chinese had a theory called \"Five Movement and Six Weather\" to study climate change and its relationship with human health and diseases. This theory is a summary of long-term observations on astronomy, astrology, calendar and",

Cai et al did not find any correlation between the growth rate of the epidemics and daily mean temperature in either Wuhan or Hunan 10-14 . On the contrary, our study suggests significant impact of daily mean temperature on the daily confirmed new case counts 14 days later. It is supposed that a sufficient time delay between exposure and confirmation is crucial for weather to exhibit its effect. Luo et al suggested that changes virus transmission occurred in a wide range of humidity and temperature conditions 11 and Bu et al concluded that temperature ranging 13~19\u2103 and humidity in 50% ~ 80% are suitable for the survival and transmission of this new coronavirus 12 .
