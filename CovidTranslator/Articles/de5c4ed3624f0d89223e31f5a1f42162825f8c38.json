In the 1950s CDVs were first cultivated in cells, and they were attenuated as vaccine viruses and adopted in modified live virus (MLV) vaccine products (1, 4) . Most currently available MLV CDV vaccines, though not all, have been manufactured by using such strains as Onderstepoort (OSP), Rockborn, or Snyder Hill, which were isolated between the 1940s and 1960s (referred to here as \"old CDV\") (1, 4). As previously described by us as well as others, recent field CDVs (referred to here as \"new CDV\") from various parts of the world possess different hemagglutinin (H) gene and protein characteristics (3, 11-14, 16, 17, 20) . In addition, antigenic heterogeneities between new and old CDVs were also demonstrated previously by using either monoclonal (2, 15, 18, 21) or polyclonal (9, 14, 15) immune sera, and these observations make it clinically important to elucidate such antigenic variations.",

Thus, the level and the nature of antibodies to CDV have been utilized as valuable alternative indicators to assess vaccine efficacy and immune status of animals (8, 19, 23) and are correlated with protection against CDV (4, 8) . However, the antigenic and genetic variations in H protein between different new CDV strains or between new and old strains may raise doubts about the efficacy of the present vaccine products (9, 18) . The ideal approach to demonstrating vaccine efficacy is to perform challenge studies in vivo. However, it is well known that experimentally reproducible clinical canine distemper is hard to achieve, and to our knowledge, only one authorized challenge system has been adopted worldwide: an intracranial challenge exposure of the dog-passaged virulent Snyder Hill strain that belongs phylogenetically to the old CDVs ( Fig. 1 ). In this context neutralizing antigenic relationships between OSP and new CDV strain KDK-1, belonging to the Asia/H1 genotype (16, 20) , were investigated.",

Thus, it will be worthwhile to confirm the present complement-mediated neutralization by using strains belonging to separate genotypes of foreign origin.",

A neutralization assay without complement can distinguish two CDV strains antigenically, and in that regard, it is biologically a more valuable method than the assay with complement. On the other hand, we observed that differences in neutralization of antigens between these different CDV strains disappeared when complement was included in the neutralization reaction mixtures. This may be one of the immune mechanisms explaining why the present canine distemper vaccines using old CDV strains are still functional and sufficiently protect dogs against present, genetically varied field strains of CDV.",
