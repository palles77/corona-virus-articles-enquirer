PEDV non-structural accessory protein ORF3 is an ion channel related to viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Our previous study showed that PEDV ORF3 has expression characteristic of aggregation in cytoplasm, but its biological function remains elusive. Thus in this study, we initiated the construction of various vectors to express ORF3, and found ORF3 localized in the cytoplasm in the aggregation manner. Subsequently, confocal microscopy analysis showed that the aggregated ORF3 localized in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to trigger ER stress response via up-regulation of GRP78 protein expression and activation of PERK-eIF2\u03b1 signaling pathway. In addition, our results showed that PEDV ORF3 could induce the autophagy through inducing conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, but couldn't influence the apoptosis. In contrast, conversion of LC3-I/LC3-II could be significantly inhibited by 4-PBA, an ER stress inhibitor, indicating that ORF3-induced autophagy is dependent on ER stress response. This work not only provides some new findings for the biological function of the PEDV ORF3 protein, but also help us for the further understanding the molecular interaction between PEDV ORF3 protein and cells.",

PED is first reported by Pensaert and DeBouck in Belgium and the United Kingdom in the 1970s (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Debouck and Pensaert, 1979) , and then spread to multiple swine-producing countries in Europe (Knuchel et al., 1992; Bridgen et al., 1993) . Since the 1990s, PED cases have become rare in Europe, but which have been continually reported in many Asian and American countries or regions, including China, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, United State, Canada, Mexico, and so on (Lee, 2015) . Especially, a large number of PED outbreaks have been reported in China in 2010, and a particularly large epidemic PED swept throughout all of North America Vlasova et al., 2014) . PED has become an increasing problem in many swine-breeding countries, resulting in tremendous economic losses to swine industry worldwide.",

The ORF3 protein exhibits a genetic variation among PEDVs. Sequence comparison of virulent and attenuated PEDV strains revealed that some of attenuation-related mutations are located in the ORF3 genes (Chen et al., 2010; Su et al., 2016) , suggesting that ORF3 protein exhibits a genetic variation among PEDVs. In addition, ORF3, as the only accessory gene in PEDV, is thought to function as an ion channel and to influence virus production and virulence (Wang et al., 2012) . PEDV ORF3 protein can prolong cellular S-phase, facilitate formation of vesicles and thus promote the proliferation of attenuated PEDV rather than virulent PEDV (Ye et al., 2015) . Previous study demonstrated that ORF3 and S are co-localized in several cellular compartments in infected cells, and ORF3 may interact with S during PEDV assembly and consequently exert its activity at this step of virus replication (Kaewborisuth et al., 2018) . On the contrary, the ORF3 accessory protein has been reported to impede reverse genetics of cellculture-adapted PEDV, because full-length ORF3, but not the truncated form, can inhibit recovery of reverse-genetics derived PEDV when expressed in trans (Wongthida et al., 2017) , and the attenuated PEDV rather than virulent PEDV can grow better in ORF3-expressing Vero cells (Ye et al., 2015) . Whereas, much more studies report that infectious PEDV could be rescued from a full-length cDNA clone with intact ORF3. For example, it is reported that the infectious-clone-derived PEDV (icPEDV) replicates as efficiently as the parental virus in cell culture and in pigs, resulting in lethal disease in vivo (Beall et al., 2016) . These controversial events altogether suggest that PEDV ORF3 may be a multifunctional protein that is involved in many cellular processes. Whereas, the exact biological function of PEDV ORF3 need to be further defined.",

Up to date, the investigation of ORF3 is hampered by difficulty of detecting protein expression (Kaewborisuth et al., 2018) . Thus in present study, we initiated the construction of various recombinant plasmids expressing PEDV ORF3 protein fused with different tags, and found ORF3 localized in the cytoplasm in the aggregation manner. PEDV ORF3 is a transmembrane protein localized in ER, which triggered ER stress via up-regulation of GRP78 and activation of PERK-eIF2\u03b1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, our results showed that PEDV ORF3 could induce the autophagy through inducing conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, but couldn't influence the apoptosis. Nevertheless, conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II could be obviously inhibited by 4-PBA, an ER stress inhibitor, indicating that ORF3-induced autophagy is dependent on ER stress response. To our knowledge, this is the first research about PEDV ORF3 protein functions on ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy simultaneously. These findings have potentially important implications for augments of our understanding of ORF3 biological function.",

After 22 h, the aggregated ORF3 became to diffusion manner, and ER was broken leading to the cell death eventually. To test the observation more directly, we examined a time course of colocalization of ORF3 and PDI by live cell imaging of GFP-ORF3-expressing Vero cells. We found that as the transfection times prolonging, expressed ORF3 aggregated to form a granule and recruited the ER to interplay each other, lastly resulting into cell disruption at 22 h post transfection, which supported the similar results with the above observation (Fig. 3E) . These data confirm that PEDV ORF3 is a transmembrane protein that localizes at ER and associates with each other to affect the cell fate.",

Since the PEDV ORF3 protein is also a transmembrane protein that localizes to the ER, we speculate that it has potential to induce ER stress response. In order to examine the role of ORF3 as a potential ER stress inducer, we transfected 293 T cells with either pcDNA3.0-Flag-ORF3 or pcDNA3.0-Flag, and set the TG-treated cells as positive control. Whole-cell lysates prepared from these harvested cells were analyzed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies in figure. The results showed that either expression of ORF3 or Tg treatment caused significant elevation of the amount of GRP78 (Fig. 4A) , which encodes crucial ER chaperones that are markers of ER stress, indicating that PEDV ORF3 protein exactly induces the ER stress response. As expected, the ORF3 also gave a similar increase of phosphorylated form of p-PERK and p-eIF2\u03b1, while the levels of total PERK and eIF2\u03b1 remained unchanged. Densitometry scans conducted using ImageJ software showed that ORF3 significantly induced more than 1-2 folds of GRP78, p-PERK and p-eIF2\u03b1 expressions (Fig. 4B) , when compared with pcDNA3.0-Flag-transfected control. These results suggest that ORF3 is responsible for ER stress response through activation PERK-eIF2\u03b1 signaling pathway.",

Now that PEDV ORF3 protein can't affect the apoptosis, we next investigate the effect of ORF3 on autophagy induction. Vero cells were transfected with pEGFP-LC3 to expression autophagy marker LC3, and then cotransfected with either pCMV-Myc-ORF3 or pCMV-Myc plasmids. Cells treated with rapamycin, an autophagy inducer of mammalian cells, were set as the positive control. The confocal microscopy analysis showed that LC3 generated diffuse signals indicating even distribution throughout in control cells, but the LC3 fluorescence redistributed to punctate vesicles indicative of autophagosome in ORF3-expressing cells (Fig. 6A ). Rapamycin also caused redistribution of GFP-LC3 to punctate structures in cytoplasm indicative of autophagosomes similar with cells expressed ORF3 protein. Quantitative analysis of the cells containing the punctate vesicles showed that cells expressing ORF3 resulted into more than 80% of autophagy, which was significantly higher than both rapamycin and negative control (Fig. 6B ). To further confirm the role of ORF3 protein in autophagy formation, we transfected Vero cells with either pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-N1-ORF3, and examined the autophagy induction by analyzing conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II using Western Blot. After 16 h post transfection, we observed a significant increase of LC3-II protein in ORF3-transfected cells, and the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I was much higher in ORF3-transfected cells when compared to the control (Fig. 6C) . Densitometry scans were conducted to represent the fold change of LC3-II expression, and the results showed the expression level of LC3-II in ORF3-transfected cells increased 1-2.5 folds (Fig. 6D ).",

Therefore, it is need to investigate the novel function of PEDV ORF3 for elucidating the mechanism by which this protein regulates PEDV life cycle.

Our results showed that PEDV ORF3 as transmembrane protein located at perinuclear area forming the punctate bodies, and plenty of PEDV ORF3 protein colocalized with ER to causes ER stress response via up-regulation of GRP78 and activation of PERK-eIF2\u03b1 signaling pathway. PEDV ORF3 protein induced the autophagy through promoting conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, but had no effect on apoptosis. Whereas, conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II could be notably inhibited by 4-PBA, an ER stress inhibitor, indicating that ER stress response contributes to ORF3-induced autophagy and ORF3 protein plays multiple roles in PEDV life cycle.",

The ion-channel function is dependent on TMDs, because the ion channel activity is reduced in ORF3 protein of attenuated typical PEDV while its amino acid substitution or deletion (Wang et al., 2012) .

In our study, we firstly constructed different eukaryotic expression vectors to expression ORF3 protein, and found ORF3 protein distributed in perinuclear cytoplasm, and then shifted for aggregation and concentrated in the nucleate of cytoplasm to form punctate patter. This distribution manner of PEDV ORF3 is similar with one study that ORF3 proteins localizes in the cytoplasm in punctate manner (Ye et al., 2015) , but distinguishes from the other report of uniform distribution in cytoplasm diffusely (Wongthida et al., 2017; Kaewborisuth et al., 2018) . We speculate that the localization and distribution manner of PEDV ORF3 might be dependent on the virus strain-type-specific differences. Furthermore, we found that PEDV ORF3 is secondary transmembrane protein containing four putative TMDs through prediction analysis, which is in accordance with previous report that proposed a structure model of the ORF3 protein consisting of four TM domains and forming a tetrameric assembly (Wang et al., 2012) . PEDV ORF3 protein expression characteristic of aggregation has nothing to do with the fusion tags no matter what cell lines used for its expression, indicating that ORF3 might induce accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins within the ER. At the same time, we performed subcellular localization analysis of PEDV ORF3 and revealed the protein likely to locate in the endoplasmic reticulum, which was confirmed by next confocal immunofluorescence analysis that showed the colocalization of ORF3 with the ER. It is noteworthy that as the amount of ORF3 expression increased, ORF3 dissociated from ER to come into being diffusion manner, and ER was broken leading to the cell death eventually, suggesting that ORF3 localizes at ER and associates with each other to affect the cell survival or death, which might be dependent on ER stress response induced by the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins within the ER to initiates a number of cellular responses to restore ER homeostasis. Whereas, whether the PEDV ORF3 TMDs induce ER stress response and subsequently cause the protein aggregation in perinuclear boundary area remain to be further elucidated.",

            "text": "The genomes of Coronaviridae are well known to code for a reasonable amount of ion channels, referred as viroporins, which usually contain TMDs and play important roles in pathogenesis, virus assembly and release. For example, E proteins of MHV (Madan et al., 2005) , SARS-CoV (Liao et al., 2006) , HCoV-229E (Wilson et al., 2004) and IBV (Ye and Hogue, 2007) possess ion channel activity. PEDV E protein has also been found to localize in the ER and the nucleus and it can cause ER stress response (Xu et al., 2013a,b) , suggesting other PEDV proteins containing TMDs, such as ORF3, have the similar potential to cause ER stress. In this study, our results showed that PEDV ORF3 protein was able to induce ER stress response, as indicated by the significant upregulation of the molecule chaperone GRP78, a typical marker of ER stress. ER stress can activate multiple cell-signaling pathways, such as UPR, to regulate gene expression at both transcriptional and translational levels, and to increase the capacity of the ER machinery to fold proteins correctly and activate the degradation of aberrant proteins (Grootjans et al., 2016) . We found that as one of three major arms of UPR, PERK pathway was activated by PEDV ORF3, resulting in the elevated phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, suggesting that ORF3 causes ER stress response to subsequently inhibit translation and protein input into the ER. 5 . PEDV ORF3 has no effect on the apoptosis. The 293 T cells were transfected with either pcDNA3.0-Flag or pcDNA3.0-Flag-ORF3 for 6 h and 12 h. Cells were harvested, fixed with 70% cold ethanol and stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI, followed by examination with flow cytometry analysis. The percentages of apoptotic cells corresponding to the fluorescenceintensity for each of the sample are indicated. D. Zou, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 235 (2019) 209-219 It is well known that UPR can adjust the biosynthetic burden and capacity of the ER to maintain homeostasis. While the damage to the ER is severe or persistent, the ER stress triggers apoptosis (Jheng et al., 2014) . Apoptosis, cell cycle change and the association of each other are common cellular responses to many Coronaviridae infections. Previous study reported that ORF3 prolong the S phase, which may associate with the virus replication (Ye et al., 2015) . It has also been demonstrated that Coronavirus infection induces apoptosis and arrests cell cycle (Chen et al., 2004) , which is caspase-dependent but p53-independent manner (Li et al., 2007) . Nevertheless, PEDV ORF3 was found to have no influence on apoptosis in our study. Coronavirus infection triggers autophagy, and the autophagosome membranes have been shown to be derived from the ER (Cottam et al., 2011) . The decision between apoptosis and autophagy in cells under ER stress may be intricately regulated by multiple mechanisms (Castillo et al., 2011) . These events promote us to investigate the other signaling pathways associated with ER stress, for instance autophagy induced by PEDV ORF3 protein. Our observations indicated that autophagy marker LC3 redistributed to punctate vesicles in cytoplasm indicative of autophagosome in ORF3-expressing cells. We also observed the conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II, because the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I was much higher in ORF3-transfected cells, indicating PEDV ORF3 plays an important role in autophagy induction via increasing conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. Moreover, when 4-PBA, an ER stress inhibitor, was used to block the ER stress response, the result of conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II could be significantly inhibited, suggesting that PEDV ORF3 protein-induced autophagy is dependent on ER stress response.",
