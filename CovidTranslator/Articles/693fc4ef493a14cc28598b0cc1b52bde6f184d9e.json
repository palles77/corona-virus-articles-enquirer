S100A9 is a damage-associated molecular pattern of the S100 protein family. Here, we found that PRRSV infection stimulated S100A9 expression in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and Marc-145 cells. S100A9 inhibited PRRSV replication via cellular Ca 2+ dependent manner. The viral nucleocapsid (N) protein co-localized with S100A9 in the cytoplasm, and directly interacted at amino acid 78 of S100A9 and amino acids 36-37 of N protein. Moreover, we also found that the mutant S100A9 (E78Q) protein exhibited decreased antiviral activity against PRRSV compared with the parent S100A9. Recombinant PRRSV rBB (36/37) with two mutations in amino acid 36-37 in the N protein exhibited greater replication than the parent PRRSV BB0907 in S100A9overexpressed PAM and Marc-145 cells. Thus, S100A9 may restrict PRRSV proliferation by interacting with the viral N protein.",

PRRSV is a 15 kb single-stranded, positive-sense enveloped RNA virus, and its genome encodes 14 nonstructural (nsps) and eight structural proteins (Chen et al., 2017a,b; Li et al., 2007) . Moreover, PRRSV infects pigs of all ages, causing fever, lethargy, inappetence, and respiratory distress (Jiang et al., 2000) . The infection of pregnant sows often results in abortion, stillbirth, and mummified fetuses. Infected piglets often present with weakness, watery diarrhea, severe respiratory symptoms, and even death (Burkard et al., 2018) . PRRSV was initially isolated in China in 1995, and the highly pathogenic strain (HP-PRRSV) was isolated in China in 2006 (Tian et al., 2007) , and it has since spread widely, taking a large economic toll on China's pork producers. The main clinical symptoms of HP-PRRSV include high fever, dyspnea, and rubefaction, whereas the primary pathological symptom is interstitial pneumonia (Li et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2007) . Since 2012, NADC30-like strains have become more prevalent in China, increasing the difficulty of prevention and control Wang et al., 2017a, b) .",

            "text": "The innate immune response is the host's first line of defense against pathogen invasion. In general, interferons (IFNs) are one of the earliest cytokines produced following viral invasion. Initially, host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogens and activate I type IFN signaling via IRF3 and NF-\u03baB to produce multiple interferon-stimulated proteins to inhibit viral infection (Wuerth et al., 2018) . However, as an immunosuppressive virus, PRRSV has many immunosuppressive mechanisms of inhibiting the host innate and adaptive immune responses to support viral replication (Chen et al., 2018) . PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 inhibits IFN-\u03b2 production by degrading CREB-binding protein (CBP) and suppressing NF-\u0138B activation (Kim et al., 2010) . In addition, nsp1\u03b2 and nsp2 can hinder the activation of IRF3 to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 expression (Beura et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010) . NF-\u03baB-essential modulator (NEMO) is an essential molecule for NF-\u0138B activation, and MAVS is an upstream molecule in the IFN-\u03b2 pathway; PPRSV nsp4 can cleave these two molecules to decrease IFN-\u03b2 production (Huang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2014) . Moreover, PRRSV infection can induce the apoptosis DC cells (Huang et al., 2015) , reduce the expression of antigen presenting molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells (Chen et al., 2018) , inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of B and T cells (Loving et al., 2015) , and promote the production of immunosuppressive cells (e.g., regulatory T cells) (Fan et al., 2015) . In addition, the rapid mutation and recombination of PRRSV are associated with a substantial challenge to both viral prevention and control. Although there are several commercially available vaccines, their effectiveness is limited. Therefore, it is extremely important to study the pathogenesis of PRRSV further, which remains poorly understood.",

            "text": "Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are biomolecules that can activate the innate immune response, as well as directly or indirectly initiate the adaptive immune response (Pouwels et al., 2014) . Numerous DAMPs have been identified, including high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), heat shock proteins (HSPs), and S100 proteins. These DAMPs may participate in viral replication, to some extent, using a variety of different means (Liu et al., 2013 Trinh et al., 2016) . S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9) is a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins. A recent study showed that S100A9 is a host restrictive factor that possesses antiviral activity against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) replication (Darweesh et al., 2018) . In our previous proteomics study, we found that the expression of S100A9 was significantly increased in PRRSV-infected PAMs (data not shown); however, the role of S100A9 in PRRSV infection remains unknown. In this study, we report that S100A9 has significant antiviral activity against PRRSV replication, and interacts with the viral N protein at amino acid 78 of S100A9 and amino acids 36-37 of the viral N protein, respectively. These findings suggest a novel host antiviral mechanism against PRRSV.",

The result showed that BAPTA, at concentration as high as 80 \u03bcM for 48 h, did not show cytotoxicity toward Marc-145 cells (Fig. 3A) , as determined by Cell Counting Kit-8. Then Marc-145 cells were transfected with pCI-S100A9-HA, subsequently treated with BAPTA for 24 h, and infected with PRRSV for another 36 h. The cells treated with BAPTA had significantly higher levels of PRRSV N-protein expression in a dose dependent manner compared to untreated cells, as shown by western blot and qRT-PCR ( Fig. 3B and C) . Additionally, a TCID 50 assay showed that chelating intracellular Ca 2+ resulted in increased PRRSV proliferation in infected cells overexpressing S100A9 (Fig. 3D ). This finding demonstrated that the activity of S100A9 against PRRSV propagation was dependent on intracellular Ca 2+ .",

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) play a sentinel role in the activation of the innate immune system by detecting pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) associated with viruses and bacteria (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2015) . PRRs include host restriction factors, many of which are simulated by interferon, which directly or indirectly target multiple stages of the viral life cycle. For instance, the membrane-associated enzyme, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase, inhibits viral entry and degrades viral proteins (Evans et al., 2017; Ke et al., 2017) .

TRIM family proteins also interfere at multiple stages of the viral life cycle, including degrading viral proteins (Fan et al., 2016) , decreasing gene expression and impeding viral assembly (Barr et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2006) ; however, as an immunosuppressive virus, PRRSV can negatively regulate the host immune response to promote viral propagation via several pathways, including multiple interferon-pathway suppression (Kim et al., 2010; Beura et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010) , host antiviral protein degradation (Huang et al., 2016 (Huang et al., , 2014 , disturbance of monocyte/ macrophages, B cell, and T cell development (Huang et al., 2015; Loving et al., 2015; Fan et al., 2015) , and reduced expression of antigen presenting molecules (Chen et al., 2018) . In the present study, we found that HP-PRRSV infection promoted S100A9 expression in both PAMs and Marc-145 cells. The overexpression and knockdown of S100A9 demonstrated that S100A9 has significant antiviral activity against PRRSV infection. Moreover, the antiviral activity of S100A9 depended on the presence of cellular calcium. The PRRSV N protein is a vital structural protein required for viral replication. Our previous reports revealed that the viral N protein is associated with the production of CD83 (Chen et al., 2017a, b) , Treg cells (Fan et al., 2015) , and IL-10 (Liu et al., 2015b) , which play an important role in virus-induced immunosuppression. A study by Zhao et al., found that the PRRSV N protein could decrease the antiviral activity of TRIM25 by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination (Zhao et al., 2019) . In the present study, to identify viral proteins that interact with S100A9 and the functional sites of such interactions, we constructed a series of plasmids expressing PRRSV proteins. Co-IP assays showed only the viral N protein was immunoprecipitated by S100A9, and amino acids 36-37 of the N protein were necessary and sufficient for the interaction. Furthermore, recombinant PRRSV rBB(36/37) with the mutations S36A and R37A in the N protein was constructed. It was confirmed that 36-37 aa of the Fig. 7 . S100A9 inhibits PRRSV replication in PAMs. (A) The qRT-PCR of PAMs transfected with siRNA targeting porcine S100A9 or non-specific siRNA. (B and C) Viral replication in PAMs transfected with siRNA-3 or non-specific siRNA for 24 h then infected with 0.01 MOI of PRRSV BB0907, measured by western blot and qPCR. (D-G) Viral replication in PAMs transduced with a lentivirus expressing S100A9 or S100A9(E78Q), (LV-S100A9 and LV-S100A9(E78Q)) and an empty vector (LV-vector). The cells were then infected with 0.01 MOI of PRRSV BB0907 or rBB(36/37), and expression was measured by Western blot and qRT-PCR. The data are expressed as the means + standard deviations from three independent experiments. Z. Song, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 239 (2019) 108498 viral N protein represented the key region at which the viral N protein interacted with S100A9. DAMPs are host-derived molecules that serve to initiate and perpetuate the innate immune response. The calcium-binding protein, S100A9, belongs to the S100 protein family, and functions as a DAMP. Generally, S100A9 binds to its respective receptor, including RAGE, TLR2, and TLR4, to activate NF-\u03baB or the MAPK signaling pathways (Kwon et al., 2013; Pandolfi et al., 2016) . A recent study revealed that some DAMPs are also involved in the regulation of PRRSV replication. For example, HP-PRRSV infection promotes S100A6 expression in PAMs, which is related to the activity of NF-\u03baB activation by HP-PRRSV (Zhou et al., 2015) . Additionally, the inhibition of endogenous HSP70 and HSP90 can attenuate PRRSV replication Gao et al., 2014) ; however, there are few reports investigating the role of S100A9 in viral infection. Some previous studies indicate that S100A9 could be induced by poly I:C stimulation (Voss et al., 2012) , and human papillomavirus infection also increases S100A9 production (Tugizov et al., 2005) . Similarly, the level of S100A9 in patients infected with coronavirus was also upregulated by more than 60-fold (Reghunathan et al., 2005) . Because S100A9 is a part of several important immune pathways, it becomes the logical target for viral proteins to interfere with host defense mechanisms. To identify the key region by which S100A9 interacts with the viral N protein, we constructed a series of plasmids expressing S100A9 mutants. The results showed that only the mutant E78Q did not co-precipitate with the N protein and had significantly less antiviral activity compared to the wild type S100A9. Moreover, similar results were also obtained in experiments with PAMs using the recombinant lentiviruses, LV-S100A9 and LV-S100A9(E78Q). These results demonstrated that the E78Q mutation caused a significant decrease in the antiviral activity of S100A9. Moreover, E78 is an S100A9 amino acid necessary for its anti-PRRSV activity.",
