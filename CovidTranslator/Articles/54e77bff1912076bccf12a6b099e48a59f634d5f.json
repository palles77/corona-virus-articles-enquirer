The rest of the 5'UTR was amplified directly from a proviral molecular clone of HIV-1 group M subtype B (pLAI) (4) . The initiation codon for Fluc expression is located within the 5'UTR IRES and the context of the AUG encompassing 30 nt from the Gag sequence was included. A peptide linker (GGGGSGGGGS) was inserted by PCR immediately upstream of the Fluc coding sequence. The first half of the linker was inserted using PCR amplification on pLAI with the 5'UTR-AflII(+) and 5'UTR-BamHI(-) primers and the second half of the linker with the 5'UTR(+) and Linker-BamHI(-) primers. The linker was cloned in the AflII and BamHI restriction sites of pDual-HIV(-1)\u0394AflII-TAR to generate pDual-IRES-HIV. This last step removed the frameshift region originally present in pDual-HIV(-1). Finally, we cut the fragment containing the Rluc coding sequence, the 5'UTR region of HIV-1 RNA and the Fluc coding sequence, using PmeI and ApaI restriction sites. This fragment was inserted into pcDNA5FRT (Invitrogen) previously linearized with SciI and ApaI to produce pFRT-IRES-HIV. Prior to this last cloning step, the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites from pcDNA5FRT were eliminated to facilitate subsequent cloning of mutant IRESes. To this end, an oligonucleotide cassette formed by the K7\u0394KpnI\u0394BamHI(+) and",

The 5'UTR region of HIV-1 is the most conserved region in the HIV-1 genome (3). The HIV-1 5'UTR region used in this study originates from pLAI. We examined the conservation of the different regions which we found to influence the 5'UTR IRES activity among group M subtype B natural variants. These regions of pLAI were aligned with the corresponding regions of HIV-1 group M subtype B variants available in the HIV sequence database of the Los Alamos National Laboratory available at the following URL : http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/. When the 134-178 stem-loop (IRENE) from pLAI wasaligned with the corresponding region of 97 available variants, we found that it is highly conserved (Supp.Fig. 1A). Most of the differences are located in the upper 7-pyrimidine loop, which did not influence the 5'UTR IRES activity. Twenty-one variants have mutations in the upper stem, but only five of these mutations disrupt a base-pair.
