            "text": ". Reaching a swift, reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in the emergency departments is imperative to direct patients to proper care and to prevent disease dissemination. COVID-19 diagnosis is based on the identification of viral RNA through RT-PCR from oral-nasopharyngeal swabs, which however presents suboptimal sensitivity and may require several hours in overstressed laboratories. These drawbacks have called for an additional, complementary first line approach. CT is the gold standard method for the detection of interstitial pneumonia, a hallmark feature of COVID-19, often present in the asymptomatic stage of the disease. Here, we show that CT scan presents a sensitivity of 95.48% (std.err=0.35%), vastly outperforming RT-PCR. Additionally, as diagnostic accuracy is influenced by disease prevalence, we argue that predictive values provide a more precise measure of CT reliability in the current pandemics. We generated a model showing that CT scan is endowed with a high negative predictive value (> 90%) and positive predictive value (69 -84%), for the range of prevalence seen in countries with rampant dissemination. We conclude that CT is an expedite and reliable diagnostic tool to support first line triage of suspect COVID-19 patients in areas where the diffusion of the virus is widespread.",

In the absence of specific treatments/vaccines, the most important strategy to save lives is to quarantine people and promptly isolate infected cases. Thus, the ability to obtain an expedite and reliable diagnosis in patients with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 is imperative, to swiftly identify patients to be directed towards appropriate quarantine or care measures.

A more informative approach to measure the effective performance of a diagnostic test used to screen a given population, e.g. patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19, should measure the fraction of true positive and true negative patients correctly identified among all the positive and negative results, hence the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV). PPV and NPV largely depend on the pre-test probability of occurrence for a given disease, which is in turn directly linked to the prevalence of the disease in the given population 20 .

Notably, CT scan guarantees a very high negative predictive value (NPV), higher than 90%, for prevalence up to 65%. This is keenly relevant especially in regions with rapidly escalating spread of the infection. According to the public data provided by the Italian Civil Protection Agency 38 , we have estimated a 39% prevalence of COVID-19, as of March 29th 2020, among suspected patients (ratio between affected patients on number of RT-PCR) in the Lombardy region. This proportion is very similar to the fraction of affected/screened patients reported in Wuhan, China 9, 39 and represents a reliable estimate of the pre-test probability of patients submitted to screening. Notably, with a pre-test probability ranging from 30 to 50%, the interval currently seen in various countries facing COVID-19 epidemics, the NPV of CT scan was between 97.68% and 94.74%, the PPV between 68.78% and 83.72%, and the accuracy between 85.65% and 88.46% respectively ( Figure 3 ). These data hence suggest that CT represents a valuable tool for the accurate initial triage of patients in the congested hospitals facing the COVID-19 epidemics, with a remarkably high NPV and an acceptable PPV. The few expected false positive cases at CT scan represent a minor problem if compared to the risk of missing or delaying the diagnosis of COVID-19, and include patients affected by other forms of interstitial lung diseases rather than healthy individuals. Importantly, CT scan may identify lung abnormalities from COVID-19 infection in a relevant amount (54%) of asymptomatic patients, according to a recent study on cases from the cruise ship Diamond Princess 22 , as well as among patients with symptoms highly suggestive of COVID-19 and with a yet negative RT-PCR 9, 12, 13, 19 .",
