Only the gallinaceous quail, especially the two semidomesticated species that are most commonly kept (the bobwhite quail [Colinus virginianus] and the Japanese quail [Coturnix coturnixjaponica]), will be considered in this article. The other species of quails are either not found in captivity or are uncommon in zoologic or private aviaries or are maintained as companion birds. The major groups of quails are presented in Table 1 .",

The Japanese quail has been grown commercially since the 16th century. 27 It matures in 6 weeks at a growth rate that exceeds that of small chicken breeds by three and a half times. The Japanese quail is marketed as pharaoh quail in the United States. A number of different strains of both quails, including color varieties, have been bred. Production of the birds occurs in laboratory environments, small-scale \"backyard\" units, and on large commercial farms where over 100,000 birds may be grown annually.

As a general rule, Japanese quail appear to be somewhat more resistant to infectious diseases than the chicken, whereas bobwhite quail are generally more susceptible. For example, adenoviruses that cause little or no disease in chickens can produce a highly fatal disease known as quail bronchitis in bobwhites. It is an extremely poor management procedure to raise quail together with chickens or turkeys. Practicing good biosecurity as one moves between flocks of different avian species or different flocks of the same species and rearing only one group of birds on a premise at a time (\"all in-all out\" production) will contribute more to the health of the flock than any drug or vaccine. Biosecurity and adequate management are the bases for flock health and can never be overemphasized. 89 ",

California quail (Callipepla californica) died following ingestion of anticoagulant pellets containing chlorophacinone intended for control of voles. The quails did not die because of the anticoagulant, however, but because the paraffin pellets used as the carrier impacted the gizzard, which led to starvation. 5 Nonviral neoplasia appears to be uncommon even in aged quail. A mixed-cell sarcoma involving the lungs, kidneys, and thigh was found in a 25-month-old moribund Japanese quail. 30 Sertoli cell tumors occurred in the testicles of3 of33 Japanese quail older than 3 years of age. Neoplastic testicles were enlarged, firm, round, and contained variable cystic spaces. Either both testicles were involved or atrophy of the contralateral testicle had occurred. Histology was typical of that seen in mammalian Sertoli cell tumors. 24 Other noninfectious disorders are more important for their value in comparative medicine and understanding degenerative disease processes than as a cause of economic loss in commercially reared flocks . Cataracts that develop without concurrent disease and increase in prevalence and severity with age have been reported in bobwhite 47 and mutant albino Japanese quails. 75 \u00b7 76 Retinal degeneration also occurs in the latter that closely resembles changes seen in glaucoma. Another important model of degenerative disease that has been developed in susceptible lines of Japanese quail is atherosclerosis. 72 Other noninfectious disorders have been identified in various strains of quail, such as chondrodystrophy3 1 and a generalized type II glycogen storage disease. 49 ",

            "text": "Natural and experimental viral infections in Japanese quail have been reviewed. 63 From a clinical viewpoint, viral infections in quail result in (I) respiratory diseases (quail bronchitis, influenza, Newcastle disease, coronavirus infection); (2) nervous diseases (avian encephalomyelitis, Newcastle disease, equine encephalitis); (3) neoplasia (Marek's disease, leukosis, reticuloendotheliosis, transmissible sarcomas); and (4) pox. With the exception of Marek's disease, quail appear to be relatively resistant to herpesvirus infections, although a herpesvirus was recovered from livers of quails with concurrent quail enteritis. 42 In contrast to commercial poultry, viral infections have not been found to be important causes of enteritis in quail. Quail reovirus was isolated from quail with severe enteritis, 66 but cryptosporidia were found to be the cause of the disease, with the virus acting only as an intensifier. 28 Also, quail have been found to be refractory to infectious bursal disease, 83 although quail X chicken hybrids are moderately susceptible. 25 Quail bronchitis is a highly contagious acute upper respiratory disease caused by type I avian adenoviruses. 87 Bronchitis in quail is unrelated to infectious bronchitis in chickens, which is caused by coronaviruses. Quail bronchitis occurs primarily in captive bobwhite quail and less commonly in Japanese quail. 7 Onset is sudden, spread is rapid, morbidity approaches 100 per cent, and mortality can range from 10 per cent to 100 per cent. The disease is most severe in quail under 4 weeks of age. Clinical signs consist of rales, coughing, sneezing, conjunctivitis, huddling, and inactivity. Nervous signs are occasionally seen. Nasal discharges and sinusitis are not characteristic of quail bronchitis. Catarrhal nasal exudate has been reported in quail corona virus infection. 58 The clinical disease becomes milder in older birds and may even be inapparent in adults. Depressed egg production with abnormal white eggs is seen in laying birds. At necropsy, inflammation of the nasal passages, trachea, and bronchi with accumulation of excess mucus can be seen.",

The characteristic lesion of dactylariosis, which distinguishes it from the central nervous system form of aspergillosis, is a granulomatous encephalitis. In this section of brain from an affected bird, malacia is generalized and severe and there are numerous multinucleated giant cells that are often elongated. The fungus does not stain with routine hematoxylin and eosin procedures. blood smears, fecal samples, and necropsy of a sample of birds on a regular basis. Procedures useful in the diagnosis of parasitic diseases in other species are equally useful for quail. A jeweler's loop or illuminated magnifier helps to recognize smaller organisms. Important diseases caused by protozoa include coccidiosis, cryptosporidiosis, and histomoniasis. Hexamita , Chilomastix, and trichomonads have been associated with mortality and diarrhea in quail, but their significance and distribution have not been determined. A number of blood parasites naturally or experimentally infect quail but are not known to cause significant disease. A possible exception is an aberrant haemosporidian infection of unknown type that caused myositis and death in bobwhite quail. Linear hemorrhages in all muscles were apparent at necropsy, and the parasites were found by histopathologic examination. 22 Although clinical coccidiosis is only diagnosed occasionally in quail, the disease is probably common but overlooked. Unlike coccidiosis in chickens, overt disease with prominent gross lesions is not typical in quail. An exception is coccidiosis in Japanese quail caused by E. tsunodai, which produces a hemorrhagic typhlitis similar to cecal coccidiosis caused by E. tenella in chickens. 79 Most cases of coccidiosis in growing quail are characterized by low to negligible mortality, slow growth, and poor feed utilization (higher feed conversions). Young quail are more severely affected than older ones. Egg production is decreased when -adult quail contract coccidoisis, but weight is unaffected. Gross lesions are absent or consist of pallor and distension of the affected part of the gut. 68 There are at least five species of Eimeria that infect coturnix quail (E. coturnicis, E. bateri, E. taldykurganica, E. tsunodai, and E. uzura) and three species that infect bobwhite (E. colini, E. dispersa, and E. lettyae). Figure 19 . Both quail are the same age. The one on the right is infected with cryptosporidia, and the one on the left is uninfected. Note the marked growth depression; dark, atrophied breast muscles; and the fluid-and gas-distended ceca and intestines in the infected bird. Cryptosporidiosis is a severe disease in young bobwhite quail. (Provided courtesy qf Dr. David Ley.) More species probably 9ist, but they have not been identified. Like other avian coccidia, the spocies in quail are highly host-specific and do not infect other unrelated avian hosts. An exception is E. dispersa, which can use other galliformes, including turkeys, as a host. Likewise, the eimerian species that infect chickens or turkeys (with the exception of E. dispersa) will not infect quail. 54 Diagnosis of coccidiosis in quail depends on demonstrating high numbers of parasites in wet smears, fecal floats, or tissue sections from quail that are not performing as well as expected. Finding parasites in normal quail or in .low numbers confirms infection and the potential of disease developing but is not sufficient for a diagnosis of coccidiosis. Anticoccidial drugs available for poultry have been used to treat affected quail with varied success. At the present time, the drug of choice for coccidiosis in Japanese quail would appear to be monensin. Both monensin and salinomycin have been found to be safe and effective for use in affected bobwhite. 67 Prevention of coccidiosis in quail requires prohibiting the introduction of infective oocysts to new flocks that must come, either directly or indirectly, from other infected quail and minimizing exposure of flocks on contaminated premises. Routine use of medicated feeds to control coccidiosis is not common.",

At the present time, there is an indication that the parasite in quail can also infect turkeys and perhaps chickens. Isolation of quail from other birds, especially turkeys, should be done to assist in preventing the disease. Concurrent infection with quail reovirus and cryptosporidia results in a more severe disease and enhances the effect of both organisms on the bird. 28 Histomoniasis is caused by the ameoboflagellate Histomonas meleagridis. Quail are moderately susceptible to the disease, typically experiencing a mortality of 10 per cent to 20 per cent, 71 although an outbreak with 100 per cent mortality has been reported. 11 Exposure of quail to the insecticide Sevin increased the susceptibility of quail to histomoniasis. 90 The protozoan exists within the eggs and larvae of Heterakis gallina rum, the common cecal worm of chickens and turkeys. Because of this, several benefits accrue to the protozoan, including protection from environment, survival for several years, and ability to use earthworms as transport hosts. Quail can become infected by ingesting fresh droppings from infected birds, eggs of the cecal worm, or earthworms-containing Heterakis larvae. Control of histomoniasis depends on preventing ingestion of the preceding substances. Routine prophylactic medicatio~t practiced by quail growers. Quail should not be raised in premises or on ground previously occupied by chickens or turkeys for at least 5 years. 21 Quail affected with histomoniasis are depressed, anorexic, and have the typical huddled, rough appearance of sick quail. Droppings are often bright sulfur yellow in color. The characteristic lesions seen at necropsy are cecal ulceration with caseous cores and multifocal necrosis in the liver (Fig. 21) . Localized peritonitis may be found adjacent to severely affected ceca. Early lesions in the liver are circular, depressed, and have a targetlike appearance; later th~y become uniformly pale.",

            "text": "Two species of Capillaria infect quail: C. contorta and C . obsignata. Both have direct life cycles and cause poor growth, anemia, mortality, and decreased production. Capillaria contorta burrows into the mucosa of the crop and esophagus, causing chronic inflammation that leads to thickening of the mucosa and formation of pseudomembranes on the luminal surface (Figs. 22 and 23A and B) . Capillaria obsignata inhabits the mucosa of the small intestine but does not cause gross lesions other than hyperemia and thickening of the gut wall with a rough appearance to the mucosa. Capillarids are quite small. They are best found in washed mucosal scrapings examined with a dissecting scope or in scrapings squashed between two glass slides and examined under the microscope. The presence of characteristic eggs with bipolar opercula in the females will identify the parasites. Finding the distinctive eggs in fecal floats can also provide a diagnosis of infection. However, capillarids are not very fecund, and the diagnostician should not be misled into thinking a bird is only mildly parasitized if only low numbers of eggs are found. Capillaria infection is difficult to treat. Levamisole is the current drug of choice. 71 The large roundworms (Ascaridia spp.) and cecal worms (Heterakis spp.) are seen in intensively raised flocks grown on litter or on the ground. These worms are readily recognized at necropsy or diagnosed by finding numerous typical eggs in fecal floats. Large numbers of roundworms will reduce productivity and may occasionally cause liver abscesses because of aberrant migration, or they may occlude the intestine. The importance of cecal worms stems more from their role in histomoniasis than from their effect on the host. Both parasites have direct life cycles. Infections can be treated with piperazine. 71 Isolating quail from fecal contamination will help control the parasites. Figure 23 . Microscopically, numerous parasites can be seen embedded in the crop mucosa (A) of quail with capillariasis. Presence of the bioperculated eggs confirms the identity of the parasites (B). Note that there is no inflammatory reaction against the parasite but that there is one against the eggs. This process probably helps the eggs move from the tissue into the crop lumen but leaves the parasites unaffected. Figure 24 . Severe dyspnea, commonly called the \"gapes,\" is the most prominent clinical sign of gapeworm infection. Figure 25 . The large, bright-red worms in a \"Y\" configuration are easily found in the trachea at necropsy and establish the diagnosis. In this quail, the infection has been longstanding because the host has produced granulomatous nodules where the parasites have attached to the mucosa. Gapeworms (Syngamus trachea) occur in the trachea and cause marked respiratory signs (\"gaping\") ( Fig. 24) and death from suffocation. They are relatively large bright-red helminths that are easily found at necropsy (Fig.  25) . By extending_th~eck and transilluminating the trachea, they can usually be seen througn the glottis of the live bird. Closer examination of the parasites will reveal the diagnostic \" y\" configuration created by the smaller male being locked in permanent copulation with the larger female . Diagnosis can also be established by finding the parasite's eggs in fecal floats.",

Prevention of gapeworm infection is bas~d on preventing quail from having access to transport hosts. Levamisole is an effective treatment. 21 Not only do quail acquire parasite infections from transport hosts infected with nematode larvae, they can also serve as a transport host for spirurids that live in the stomach and intestines of carnivores.
