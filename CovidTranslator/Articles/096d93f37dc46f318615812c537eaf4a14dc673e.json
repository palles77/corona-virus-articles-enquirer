            "text": "Compared with the above-mentioned viral and eukaryotic fusion events, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that allow bacteria access to the internal milieu of host cells (FIG. 1) . What is known is that this process is mediated by a family of surface proteins that are known as bacterial INVASINS and, as in viral entry, bacterial entry requires actin polymerization. Following host cell-receptor binding, invasins trigger the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of cytoskeleton effector molecules and scaffolding proteins, which results in bacterial internalization 6-10 (endocytosis). However, it is not known whether invasins play a further part in bacterial pathogenesis. Evidence from this report indicates that a family of bacterial cellentry proteins shares the modular organization of SNARE heterotetramers and viral homotrimeric spike proteins (FIG. 2) . It is intriguing to speculate that, because of their conserved modular architecture -which is defined by a membrane anchor, a central COILED-COIL motif and a receptor-binding domain (RBD) (FIG. 2a) -viral fusion proteins, bacterial invasins and SNAREs might share similar mechanisms of action. The absence of amino-acid homology coupled to the analogous distribution of domains indicates a common mechanism that might add selective advantages to the pathogen, which would ensure survival in a particular environment. Furthermore, this indicates that different organisms might have evolved common solutions when challenged with the task of penetrating cellular barriers.",

In 1992, a seminal discovery showed that proteolytic cleavage of a membrane fusion protein, known as VAMP1, by the tetanus toxin was sufficient to inhibit the secretion of neurotransmitters from synaptic junctions and cause the deadly tetanus disease 11 . This finding led to the understanding that intracellular Abstract | Molecular machines orchestrate the translocation and entry of pathogens through host cell membranes, in addition to the uptake and release of molecules during endocytosis and exocytosis. Viral cell entry requires a family of glycoproteins, and the structural organization and function of these viral glycoproteins are similar to the SNARE proteins, which are known to be involved in intracellular vesicle fusion, endocytosis and exocytosis. Here, we propose that a family of bacterial membrane proteins that are responsible for cell-mediated adherence and entry resembles the structural architecture of both viral fusion proteins and eukaryotic SNAREs and might therefore share similar, but distinct, mechanisms of cell membrane translocation. Furthermore, we propose that the recurrence of these molecular machines across species indicates that these architectural motifs were evolutionarily selected because they provided the best solution to ensure the survival of pathogens within a particular environment.",

This is achieved by endocytosis and exocytosis. In parallel, microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria have developed mechanisms to enter host cells to facilitate their replication, transport and transmission. One of the recent breakthroughs in cell biology has been the understanding that molecular machines that share similarities both in structural domains and functional mechanisms mediate both viral entry and cellular exocytosis events. The fusion between cell membranes during vesicle trafficking and exocytosis (FIG. 1) is mediated by a conserved set of tetrameric proteins, collectively known as SNARES [1] [2] [3] [4] (see  Glossary) . Similarly, the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells is mediated by a family of glycoproteins that usually fold as homotrimers and that mediate the fusion complex assembles through the hydrophobic and ionic core-packing interactions that are formed between vSNAREs and tSNAREs. The free energy that is derived from the formation of the four-helix bundle and a subsequent conformational change promotes tethering of the two opposing membranes to mediate subsequent fusion events [2] [3] [4] 12, 14, 15 . Such fusion events mediate either exocytosis of secretory vesicles or endosomal trafficking (FIG. 1) ; and they involve additional factors, such as the exocyst multi-subunit protein docking complex, microtubules and the recruitment of tethering proteins through Rab GTPases (such as Rab3A) 15, 16 that specify the fusion of transport vesicles with a particular target membrane.",

Data from the crystal structure of haemagglutinin before and after the pH-induced conformational change allowed an understanding of the mechanism of viral fusion with the host cell 27 . In this multistep process, haemagglutinin binds surface-exposed cell receptors (FIG. 1) . The virus is then internalized, and the subsequent acidification of the endosome causes a conformational change of haemagglutinin (irreversible in most cases), and triggers the fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane 28, 29 . Similar to haemagglutinin of the influenza virus, class I viral fusion proteins from HIV, Visna virus, and SARS-CoV are characterized by a central domain, which during fusion, adopts a trimer of 'hairpins' folds, which leads to the assembly of a six-helix, coiled-coil bundle 25, [30] [31] [32] [33] .

Detailed analysis of the NadA primary and secondary structure profiles, and comparison with coiled-coil regions of viral glycoproteins has allowed the prediction of the two putative heptad repeat domains HR1 and HR2 within the stalk region. In the absence of threedimensional data, the presence of a coiled-coil structure for NadA was partially confirmed by CIRCULAR DICHROISM (CD) SPECTRA ANALYSIS, which shows a prominent \u03b1-helical content for this protein (S.

The Eib (E. coli immunoglobulin binding) proteins form high-molecular-weight oligomers. They show the same YadA-like tripartite organization (FIG. 2e) centred on a core coiled-coil motif with a C-terminal membrane anchor that shares sequence identity with the corresponding domains of UspA2 (60.3%),YadA (56.7%) and NadA (58.6%). One hypothesis is that eib genes were transferred among E. coli strains by phage vectors. A similar mechanism of prophage-driven transfer might have been involved in the propagation of these surface molecules (or of their anchor domains) to different recipient bacterial species. Support for this idea comes from the fact that some of the genes that code for proteins of the Oca family, such as YadA and NadA, are carried on mobile genetic elements (TABLE 1) .",

Vesicle trafficking also involves the activation of intracellular cytoskeleton effector molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and other small GTPases such as Cdc42. During the final stages of exocytosis, F-actin forms a cortical network under the plasma membrane of a cell. It has been shown that exocytotic vesicles are transported along microtubules to the plasma membrane, but are not secreted before the cortical actin network opens locally to form the exit pore. Also, PI3K activates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ), which has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking. PIP 2 stimulates de novo actin polymerization All these proteins form high-molecularweight oligomers, have a role in cell attachment, mediate serum resistance and are good immunogens.",

Similar to SNAREs and viral membrane fusion proteins, a group of Gram-positive bacterial adhesins are known to undergo a conformational change on receptor binding, which brings the molecule from a disordered to an ordered state, therefore reinforcing binding and facilitating subsequent cell invasion 73, 74 . Proteins that mediate these functions also share a fibrillike elongated architecture, usually composed of coiled coils. Examples of such proteins include the well characterized dimeric M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes 75 , the fibronectin binding protein (FnbA) of Streptococcus dysgalactiae, the fibrinogen binding protein (FgbP) of Streptoccoccus equi 76, 77 , and the choline binding protein (CbpA) of Streptococcus pneumoniae 78 . The M protein of S. pyogenes is a fibrillar molecule that binds to fibrinogen and albumin and promotes bacterial adhesion to host cells 75 . Interestingly, FnbA and structurally similar proteins that are produced by Staphylococcus aureus and S. pyogenes mediate bacterial cell entry by binding to integrins through a fibronectin-based bridging mechanism 79 . This mechanism involves a conformation As with many virulence factors, YadA is located on the 70-kD plasmid (pYV). Unlike the \u03b2-immunoglobulin-like Yersinia spp. InvA, YadA is a homotrimer that is induced during exponential growth in minimal media at 37\u00b0C (REF. 72 ). In vitro,YadA binds collagen, laminin, cellular fibronectin, intestinal submucosa and hydrophobic surfaces 70 . Single amino-acid mutations in the N-terminal receptor-binding domain resulted in the abrogation of YadA binding to extracellular matrix proteins in vitro, which led to a marked reduction in virulence in an animal model of infection 63 . Eitel and Dersch argue that YadA belongs to a secondary uptake pathway that might complement InvAmediated cell entry when synthesis of InvA is repressed 72 . Earlier reports showed that yadA genes that were encoded on the pYV plasmid promoted internalization of Yersinia invA mutants, but with a lower frequency of occurrence 55, 57, 71 . More recent studies provide evidence that E. coli strains that express YadA under the pBAD-inducible arabinose promoter, in gentamicin protection assays, had the same ability to adhere to and enter cell monolayers as E. coli that expressed InvA 72 .",

Other studies show that actin polymerizes from cholesterol-sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains called 'rafts' , in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner 80 . Productive viral and bacterial infections are also frequently associated with profound changes of the host cytoskeleton. Such changes are often mediated through phosphorylation-regulated signalling cascades. Similar to SNARE-mediated intracellular trafficking, some viral uptake mechanisms involve a tightly controlled interplay of intracellular molecules such as clathrinan effector protein that interacts with intracellular transport effector molecules, such as Esp15 (REF. 81 ), amphiphysin and the AP2 adaptor proteins 82 . For example, during cell entry, the influenza virus might be taken up by a clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent endocytic route, following the initial interaction of viral haemagglutinin with its sialicacid receptor 17, 83 . Also, in vitro data indicate that the GTPase dynamin, which is known to be involved in the release of endosomes from the plasma membrane, is also essential in the early events of influenza virus endocytosis [84] [85] [86] (FIG. 3b) .",

Signalling is a common theme in cell entry, as internalization of the adenovirus through ligand binding to its co-receptor integrin activates both protein kinase C and PI3K 89 , as well as subsequent effector molecules that are involved in vesicular trafficking (Rab5) and cytoskeletal organization (Rac1, Cdc42 and dynamin). Interestingly, pre-treatment of epithelial cells with cytochalasin D, a product that disrupts actin fibres, causes a dose-dependent inhibition of adenovirus internalization 89 .

Two bacterial membrane proteins, YadA and NadA, have specifically been shown to mediate bacterial entry into host cells, a function that is analogous to that of viral spike proteins. The data available on the mechanism of invasion promoted by YadA and NadA, compared with what is known about viral uptake, allow some speculation on a possible common route of cell entry that is shared by viruses and bacteria. so far, there is no data on the signalling events that occur in YadA-mediated cell entry. It is known that, following tight adhesion of Yersinia spp. to the host cellular surface, InvA-mediated bacterial uptake seems to involve FAK 125 , Src, PI3K, the small GTPase Rac1 and the ARP2/3 complex 90,91 (FIG. 3c) . Similarly, recent data support the hypothesis that YadA-mediated bacterial invasion is dependent on protein phosphorylation events, as the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors strongly impairs Yersinia spp. cell entry through YadA 72, 92 . InvA-and YadA-promoted cell entry occurs through the interaction with the \u03b21-integrins 66 and the interaction of YadA with the \u03b21-integrins is mediated through collagen and fibronectin [68] [69] [70] . On the basis of in vitro experiments that describe collagen signal transduction, one might infer that YadAmediated cell entry is dependent on cell signalling -collagen IV and laminin, but not fibronectin, are known to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular FAK and other signalling molecules. Notably, one of the molecules involved in the InvA signalling pathway, PI3K, is implicated in actin polymerization and can also interact with FAK 125 , which itself associates with \u03b2 1 -integrins 93, 94 . This implicates modulation of the actin cytoskeleton in YadA-mediated cell entry.",

The signalling cascades and intracellular pathways that are used by viruses and bacteria to induce host cell uptake converge on those used in vesicle trafficking. A common theme is the activation of GTPases and the subsequent cytoskeletal changes that aid in the movement of vesicles or in the uptake of pathogens. a | In SNARE-mediated vesicle trafficking and exocytosis, intracellular factors such as the exocyst protein complex and the small GTPase Rab3A are important in the docking of the vesicle to the plasma membrane. Vesicle trafficking also involves the activation of intracellular cytoskeleton effector molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and other small GTPases such as Cdc42. F-actin nucleation mediated by N-WASP (neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) and ARP2/3, and microtubule elongation are crucial in trafficking events. Receptor-mediated attachment of viruses such as influenza virus (b) and bacteria such as Yersinia spp. (c) also leads to the signalling and activation of GTPases (such as dynamin, Ras, Rac1 and Cdc42), as well as actin polymerization through the ARP2/3 complex (mediated by N-WASP in bacteria, and N-WASP and intersectin in viruses). PI3K is activated by the binding of certain viruses and bacteria to cell surface receptors, and is also implicated in actin polymerization.
