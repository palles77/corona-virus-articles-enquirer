            "text": "In this large multicenter, multiyear study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis, we found that children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis resembled older children with asthma. Compared with children with RSV-associated bronchiolitis, children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis were more likely to be older and have a prior history of wheezing and eczema. Furthermore, in the multivariable model, children hospitalized with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis were more likely to be treated with systemic corticosteroids even after controlling for age, sex, race, history of wheezing, eczema, and inhaled corticosteroid use. This differential treatment of children with rhinovirusassociated bronchiolitis by clinicians at academic medical centers across the US is an implicit acknowledgement by these treating clinicians that they consider bronchiolitis to be a heterogeneous respiratory illness. The next step is to determine if there are identifiable subgroups of children with bronchiolitis (eg, rhinovirus positive, history of wheezing) who may respond differently to medications (eg, albuterol, systemic corticosteroids) or who may need closer long-term follow-up given their potentially higher risk of having asthma. Most medications tested in randomized controlled trials for children hospitalized with bronchiolitis are the same ones used to treat children with asthma exacerbations (eg, bronchodilator agents and systemic corticosteroids). To date, many of the large-scale bronchiolitis medication trials have required children to be age <12 months and have no history of wheezing. 3 Based on the present data, these inclusion criteria may have created fairly homogenous study populations of children with RSV bronchiolitis. Although RSV is the most common viral etiology of severe bronchiolitis and the results of these well conducted studies remain valid, the present data in combination with other reports 2,6-8 suggest that these large-scale studies probably should be repeated in children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis. A change in practice for this subgroup would affect the shortterm outcomes of an estimated 25 000 US children age <2 years hospitalized annually with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis and many more world-wide. 1 These repeat treatment trials also may prove important for long-term outcomes because 40%-50% of infants with severe bronchiolitis will be recognized to have childhood asthma, 1, 9 and children with rhinovirus-associated bronchiolitis may be at particularly high risk. 1 Unfortunately, because there is no instrument yet that can reliably predict which children with bronchiolitis have or will develop asthma, there also is no means of accurately conducting prevention trials. Indeed, it is unlikely that primary asthma prevention efforts will be successful if we treat all children with bronchiolitis as a homogeneous group without identifying children (ideally infants) at highest risk.",
