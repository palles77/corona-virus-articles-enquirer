For example, sensors based on field-effect transistor (FET) configurations with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [1] [2] [3] , graphene [4] [5] [6] [7] , and nanowires (NWs) [8] [9] [10] have been widely used for sensing the electric charge of biomolecules (e.g., glucose, proteins and DNA) after their adsorption on the FET surface. The most reported biological interactions with nanomaterial-based FET sensors are enzymatic glucose detection, antibodyantigen binding (immunoreaction) and DNA hybridization [1, 11, 12] .",

For example, the role played by CNT density in FET-biosensor performance has been reported [11, [13] [14] [15] , demonstrating that it is critical in achieving high uniformity and analytical performance. Following that perspective, the influence of NW dimensions and doping levels for the sensitivity of NW-FET devices has also been demonstrated by theoretical and experimental studies [10, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Sensitivity and limit of detection (LOD) are figures of merit that are closely associated with the transduction mechanism and morphological characteristics of sensors [21] , being important tools for assessing analytical reliability, capacity, and variability in techniques and devices [22] .",

The sensing mechanism of chemical and biological systems with NWs is based on modulating the NW-surface potential, which is due to the change of charge density of the target analytes after their binding to the receptor groups linked to the NW surface. Thus, the depletion or the accumulation of carriers in the NW structure causes the high sensitivity of the devices [44] . For FET devices with SWCNTs, three possible mechanisms have been proposed and extensively reviewed by Heller et al. [45] . When analyte molecules interact with CNTs, the electronic properties of devices are altered causing changes in the current signal due to: charge transfer between molecules and NTs; scattering potential for mobile charges; or, charge scattering caused by local deformation.",

Such physical features can affect the electronic structure of SWCNTs and consequently their mobility and current on each device (e.g., leading to variations in conductance, ON/OFF ratios, and sensitivity). Also, for NWs, the drawbacks in device fabrication are associated with the failure in reliable control of the number and the diameters of integrated NWs in individual sensing devices [48] . The fluctuation in the position of Si-NWs on the device surface and the difficulty in maintaining the high signal-to-noise ratio in complex nanodevices remain as a challenge to Si-NW-device fabrication [46] . Concerning the graphene-based sensors, the variations in electrical, chemical, and mechanical properties and For multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). c Such characteristics are also used to define the graphene-based materials; however, some differences should be considered: graphene has a metallic character and comprises only C and H atoms, graphene oxide (GO) has in addition O groups and the C:O ratio is between 2 and 3, and the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has an oxygen fraction 610%. consequent sensing performance are due to fabrication factors (e.g., contact resistances, and configuration of graphene on metal electrodes) [49] . From the above considerations, it can be concluded that all variations observed in nanomaterial-based sensors, independently of the nature of nanostructures, have repercussions for the analytical performance, and essentially their reproducibility. The variations in nanomaterial characteristics from device-to-device produce great variability in device properties and their analytical performance, hindering further application of such sensors to real samples, and limiting the scale-up potential.

The enhanced sensitivity associated with a low density of SWCNTs is partly explained by the elimination of direct metallic NT pathways, enhancing the semiconductor behavior of NTs and providing a strong gate dependence, lower capacitance, and high ON/OFF ratios, while the high density of SWCNTs reflects their quasi-metallic behavior [14] . The ultrasensitivity of FET biosensors with SWCNT networks for detection of DNA molecules (0.1 fM) was also verified by Fu et al. [50] (Table 2) , where the lower density of NTs improved the ON/OFF ratio and LOD of devices by three and five orders of magnitude, respectively.",

The increase in sensitivity with the decrease in number of NWs reported by Li et al. [48] was attributed to the increase in binding events between NWs and hIgG molecules, which results in higher current changes of sensing devices. The sensitivity increase obtained with smaller NW diameters [48] can be explained by the increase of surface-to-volume ratio in thin NWs, leading to large conductance changes [51] . The sensitivity increase with the decrease in NW-doping concentration [48] can be attributed to the reduced effect of charge screening in NWs at lower doping densities [16] . Li et al.

[56] have verified better signal-to-noise ratio, large conductivity, and higher sensitivity in FET devices with narrower channels (100 nm) rather than with wider channels (2 lm), which may be due to a decrease in effective length of the current paths. Lee et al. [56] have determined mathematical relations between the width of SWCNT channel and the signal-to-noise ratio, conductivity, and sensitivity, as shown in Table 3 . Consequently, the improved sensor could be applied to the detection of Hg 2+ ions (LOD of $1 pM) in drinking water [56] . Highest sensitivity with smallest channel dimensions was also reached by Kim et al. [19] when NW-FET devices were applied to prostate specific antigen (PSA) detection (30 aM), due to the easy depletion of Si-NW channels by negatively charged biomolecules in such conditions. Another attempt to improve the analytical performance of biosensing systems is performing the experiments in specific operational conditions; Gao et al. [18] and Heller et al. [57] have proposed the performing of biosensing experiments on FET devices with Si-NWs and SWCNTs, respectively, at sub-threshold regime (rather than linear regime) to improve the sensitivity of devices. Gao et al. [18] have developed Si-NW-FET devices doped with boron for the PSA detection, and they found that FET devices have the optimal signal-to-noise ratio and LOD at sub-threshold regime (Table 3) , which is the zone preceding the higher slope in I D \u00c0 V G plot. That could be due to the increase of conductance, leading to a most effective gating effect of analyte molecules, which in turn it is due to the reduced screening of charge carriers of Si-NWs. Heller et al. [57] developed NT-FETs with a liquid gate for the detection of poly-L L-lysine and poly-L L-aspartic acid, and they also shown that the maximum signal-tonoise ratio (Table 3 ) was obtained when NT-FET devices are operated in sub-threshold regime.",

When the analytical response (DI D ) was plotted against the various concentrations of PSA through a calibration model based on the Langmuir isotherm equation, significant differences were observed in the DI D values among individual devices (Table 4 ). Abe et al. [58] associated such differences with the nonuniformity of CNT channels (i.e. CNTs with different chiralities), which was supported by the different values of transconductance obtained.

The applicability of the calibration method developed to real-time biosensing was an advantage, since the absolute response in current (nA units), which led to the large device-to-device variation, was modified for a response in voltage (mV units, calibrated response), reducing such variation. In this way, the calibrated response depends on only the change in the effective gate voltage induced by the binding of streptavidin. Moreover, the calibrated responses from different devices lower the estimated coefficient of variation (CV), compared to the CV obtained from absolute response (Table 4) .",

The sensor response (R a /R g ), due to the charge transfer between rGO and adsorbed gas molecules, was assessed by the relation between the device resistance before (R a , in air) and after (R g ) gas sensing. In order to overcome the device-to-device variation, the signal-processing method proposed suggested that the calibrated sensor response could be a consistent indicator of the analyte concentration. Schedin et al. [64] reported that the change in the charge-carrier density of graphene in target gas and in air is linearly dependent on the analyte concentration. Then, as the sensing response (R a /R g ) is due only to the gas adsorption on rGO [49] , the correlation of (R a \u00c0 R g ) versus R a has a slope dependent on the analyte concentration. Furthermore, a high linear correlation was observed for seven graphene-based devices (R 2 = 0.994), which revealed that the model used for calibration is effective in suppressing the device-to-device variation and makes the graphene-based sensors amenable for further practical applications.",

The adjusted and optimized calibration models can have some limitations when applied to universal sensors, since the estimated parameters are specific for each set of experimental data (i.e. they can be determined only if the experimental data fit strict mechanistic models). For example, the implementation of the Langmuir isotherm model should take into consideration the following requirements: a monolayer adsorption of analytes on binding sites is employed; all adsorption species interact with one site only and not with another; and, the adsorption energy of all sites is identical and independent of the presence of adsorbed species on neighboring sites. Moreover, such requirements based on monolayer coverage, adsorption-site equivalence and independence are not met in biosorption because biological molecules have various types of binding site, which contribute to the biosorption process. However, the formation of a monolayer is possible only under low-pressure conditions, and the theoretical homogeneity of binding events requested is not always verified in real surfaces, so limiting application of the model. Then, when the Langmuir isotherm model is applied to the calibration of nanomaterial-based sensors, special care must be taken about the effectiveness of such an application and about the experimental conditions of the sensor development.",
