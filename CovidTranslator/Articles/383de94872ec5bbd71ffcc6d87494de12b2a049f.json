            "text": "A purified recombinant spike (S) protein was studied for its effect on stimulating human peripheral blood monocyte macrophages (PBMC). We examined inflammatory gene mRNA abundances found in S protein-treated PBMC using gene arrays. We identified differential mRNA abundances of genes with functional properties associated with antiviral (CXCL10) and inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8) responses. We confirmed cytokine mRNA increases by real time quantitative(q) RT-PCR or ELISA. We further analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the prominent IL-8 response. By real time qRT-PCR, S protein was shown to stimulate IL-8 mRNA accumulation in a dose dependent manner while treatment with E protein did not. Also, titration of S protein-specific production and secretion of IL-8 by ELISA showed that the dose of 5.6nM of S produced a significant increase in IL-8 (p=0.003) compared to mock-treated controls. The increase in IL-8 stimulated by a concentration of 5.6 nM of S was comparable to concentrations seen for S protein binding to ACE2 or to neutralizing monoclonal antibody suggesting a physiological relevance. An NF-\u03baB inhibitor, TPCK (N-Tosyl-L-Phenylalanine Chloromethyl Ketone) could suppress IL-8 production and secretion in response to S protein in PBMC and THP-1 cells and in HCoV-229E virus-infected PBMC. Activation and translocation of NF-\u03baB was shown to occur rapidly following exposure of PBMC or THP-1 cells to S protein using a highly sensitive assay for active nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 transcription factor. The results further suggested that released or secreted S protein could activate blood monocytes thru recognition by toll-like receptor (TLR)2 ligand.",

            "text": "The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic of 2003 has rekindled an interest in coronavirus interaction with the host innate immune system. The SARS-CoV-induced disease, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) is associated with a major inflammatory component. Increased cytokine and chemokine production in response to virus infection has been the focus of several investigations. (Frieman et al. 2008) Peripheral blood monocyte macrophages (PBMC) are a tool for investigation of host response and mechanism of pathogenesis. PBMC may become activated by encountering SARS-CoV and recruit neutrophils, monocytes and immune responders such as natural killer (NK), T, and B cells to the site to shape early adaptive immunity (He L. et al. 2003 (He L. et al. , 2006 . PBMC may also carry the virus to other sites such as the liver and brain and cause disease or persist for some time (Shao et al. 2006) . PBMC are nonproductively infected by SARS-CoV. Virion minus RNA is synthesized but little or no infectious virus is produced . The major disease syndrome, SARS, is in part due to monocyte macrophage responses (Hsueh et al. 2004 and Verma, 2002) . We hypothesized that the spike (S) protein could play a significant role in inducing monocyte activation and that the NF-\u03baB pathway is the mediator of the response.",

The genome encodes a 5'nonstructural gene ORF1ab, structural genes S, E, M, N and accessory genes in ORFs 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 (Frieman et al. 2008 ). S, M and E are embedded in the envelope. Trimers of the spike (S) protein form large club-shaped protrusions that are responsible for virus adsorption to its receptor and cell fusion. Each 150-180kDa spike monomer has receptor-binding activity in S1, the N-terminal half and fusion activity in S2, the C-terminal half . S1/S2 are not cleaved during maturation. The large external S1 domain binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the major cellular receptor found on ciliated nasotracheal epithelial cells, lung alveolar cells and intestinal enterocytes but not found on T cells, B cells or macrophages in the spleen and lymphoid organs (Li et al. 2003, Chen and Subbarao 2007) . Virions have uncleaved viral spikes and during entry through endocytic vesicles or through fusion at the plasma membrane, viral spikes are cleaved by cathepsin L , Bosch et al. 2008 . Trypsin cleavage of the spike prior to infection also permits entry through the plasma membrane (Bosch et.al, 2008) . Factor Xa, a membrane bound protease, cleaves SARS S protein into functional S1 and S2 subunits and allows viral entry. (Du et al. 2007 ).",

Using Brilliant\u00ae SYBR\u00ae green Q-PCR master mix from Stratagene (Stratagene Inc, La Jolla CA.) to provide precise quantification of initial target in each PCR reaction, the amplification plot was examined at a point during the early log phase of product accumulation. This is accomplished by assigning a fluorescence threshold above background and determining the time point at which each sample's amplification plot reached the threshold (defined as the threshold cycle number or C T . the threshold is a numerical value assigned automatically by the software for each run above the calculated baseline. The C T value assigned to a particular sample thus reflects the point during the amplification reaction at which sufficient number of amplicons has accumulated above the baseline. After a suitable threshold is selected, the data is analyzed and C T values for each sample determined. Differences in threshold cycle number (C T ) are used to quantify the relative amount of PCR target contained within each tube. Relative expression of mRNA species is calculated using the comparative C T method. Briefly, for each sample, the difference in C T values (\u0394C T ) was calculated for each mRNA by taking the mean C T of duplicate tubes and subtracting the mean C T of the duplicate tubes for the reverence RNA (\u03b2-Actin) measured on an aliquot from the same RT-reaction.",

In order to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation, we examined the effect of pretreatment of cells with TPCK, an NF-\u03baB inhibitor that inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1 protease (Henkel, 1993) . PBMC cultures (10 4 -10 5 cells) or THP-1 cultures (10 6 cells) were pretreated with 25\u03bcM TPCK for 20 min, followed by S protein treatment and incubation in the presence of TPCK for 24h. Treated with S protein alone, TPCK alone or mock-treated served as controls. Production and secretion of IL-8 into the supernatant medium was measured by ELISA. Our results showed that in PBMC, S protein alone increased IL-8 significantly (1714\u00b1 432 pg/ml versus control 275\u00b1330 pg/ml, p=0.005) whereas pretreatment of PBMC with TPCK significantly reduced the amount of IL-8 produced in response to S protein (1714\u00b1 432 pg/ml versus S protein with inhibitor, 94 \u00b1157pg/ml, p=0.024, 95% inhibition). In mock-treated PBMC with inhibitor 66 \u00b1 113 pg/ml of secreted IL-8 was produced Figure 5A . Similarly, in THP-1 cells, S protein alone increased IL-8 significantly (1403\u00b1 79 pg/ml versus control 863 \u00b1 48 pg/ml, p=0.017) whereas pretreatment with TPCK significantly reduced the amount of Il-8 produced in response to S protein (1403\u00b1 79 pg/ml versus S protein with inhibitor, 3.4\u00b13.2 pg/ml). In mock-treated THP-1 cells with inhibitor <1.5pg/ml of IL-8 was produced Figure  5B . Next, the effect of TPCK inhibitor on IL-8 secretion in HCoV-229E-infected PBMC was measured during one cycle of virus replication (8h post infection). TPCK only partially inhibited the secretion of IL-8 and the effect was not seen until 6 h after infection suggesting that post-entry events were involved Figure 5C . TPCK toxicity for virus-infected cells was measured by plaque assay. HCoV-229E yield was 38% lower in PBMC cultures in the presence of 25\u03bcM TPCK. Virus titer with TPCK was 4.7 log 10 vs 5.13 log 10 pfu/ml without TPCK at 8h post infection. Our results indicated that NF-\u03baB activation was required for production and secretion of IL-8 in response to treatment of PBMC or THP-1 cells with S protein. However, TPCK treatment was not sufficient to completely inhibit IL-8 production and secretion in PBMC infected with HCoV-229E at MOI of 1.",

            "text": "Since the SARS syndrome is characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory response and NF-\u03baB is the major transcription factor activated in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Fan et al. 2001) , we sought to determine whether S protein-induced IL-8 production is mediated by NF-\u03baB activation. We examined the activity of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, TPCK. This NF-\u03baB inhibitor acts by inhibiting IKB\u03b1 protease so that IKB\u03b1 is not proteolytically degraded and NF-\u03baB is not released to undergo nuclear translocation (Henkel et al. 1993) . We observed that the addition of TPCK before treatment with S protein significantly inhibited IL-8 secretion suggesting that NF-\u03baB activation was required for S protein-induced IL-8 secretion. TPCK partially inhibited IL-8 secretion in HCoV-229E-infected PBMC and also reduced the virus yield. These effects on HCoV-229E-infected PBMC could be due to inhibition of proteases and possibly to induction of apoptosis (Zhu et al. 1997) . HCoV-229E spike resembles SARS-CoV spike. Both SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E spikes do not contain furin recognition sites and are uncleaved in the virion . Cathepsin L cleavage separates the receptor binding subunit (S1) from the membrane anchored fusion subunit . Both viruses use clathrin-mediated endocytosis for ACE2 or CD13 (human aminopeptidase N) receptor mediated entry (Yeager et al.1992 , Inoue et al. 2007 . Inhibitors of cathepsin L, a cysteine protease, block cell fusion and entry via endocytosis for both viruses (Bosch et al. 2008 , Kawase et al. 2008 . TPCK is an inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases and prevents MHV spike cleavage in L2 cells (Mizzen et al. 1986 ). This class of inhibitors did not block SARS S1 cleavage from the spike trimer . However, Factor Xa, a membrane bound protease, could cleave SARS S protein into functional S1 and S2 subunits and Ben-HCl, an inhibitor of trypsin and serine proteases, inhibited cleavage and effectively blocked viral entry (Du et al. 2007) . Thus, in addition to NF-\u03baB inhibition, TPCK might prevent S protein cleavage. Further work is necessary to address this issue.",

We found a significant increase in nuclear NF-\u03baB p65 transcription factor activity in S proteintreated PBMC and THP-1 cells compared to mock treatment. This indicated that S protein caused a specific activation of NF-\u03baB signaling. Chang et al. (2004) suggested that in hACE2 receptor positive lung epithelial and fibroblast cells, SARS S1 protein induced IL-8 via AP-1 activator thru hACE2 signaling. We found that TLR2 expression was sufficient to allow for IL-8 production in response to S protein. TLR2, like all TLRs, activates a common signaling pathway that culminates in the activation of NF-\u03baB ( Barton et al. 2003) . TLR2 is predominantly expressed at high levels on macrophages in humans and can be activated by several viruses or viral components (Finberg et al. 2007 ). Plasmacytoid cells use the TLR pathway for viral defense (Barton et al. 2003) . Other cells use cytosolic RNA receptors RIG1-like helicases (RLHs) and MDA-5 (Uematsu et al. 2005 ) and nucleic acid recognizing TLRs 3,7,8 and 9 that are critical in the regulation of the production of type 1 IFNs in response to virus infection (Finberg et al. 2007 ). TLR2 is not an IFN\u03b2 inducer (Barton et al. 2003) . IFN\u03b2 mRNA did not increase in S protein-treated PBMC in our experiments (data not shown). TLR2 mRNA was shown to be increased in PBMC from acute phase SARS patients (Reghunathan et al. 2005) . Further work is underway to confirm our observations.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we have provided evidence that S protein induces IL-8 in PBMC in vitro and in THP-1cells. Others have shown this for lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts ). S protein induction was dose dependent. A dose of 5.6nM per 2\u00d710 5 PBMC increased IL-8 secretion significantly compared to mock-treated controls. The ability of S protein to increase IL-8 mRNA was mediated by activation of NF-\u03baB possibly via TLR2 ligand and could be inhibited by the NF-\u03baB inhibitor TPCK. The ability to detect elevated NF-\u03baB transcription factor activity in the nucleus in response to S protein suggests that this is most likely occurs by the mechanism of induction. Moreover increased secretion of IL-8 and IL-6 cytokines indicated that levels of proinflammatory mediators could be enhanced by S protein interaction with monocyte macrophages and could stimulate NK, neutrophil and monocyte migration to the site of infection. Differential mRNA abundances determined by a Microarray focused on immunologically relevant genes after treatment of PBMC (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells) with 11.2nM S protein for 24 h. Statistically significant (p value <0.05) differences in mRNA abundance were identified using the student's t-test by comparing treated with mock-treated culture from three or more independent experiments. Sixteen differences in mRNA abundance were identified. 1 CXCL10 was further analyzed by qRT-PCR. S protein-treated PBMC synthesized and secreted significantly (p<0.05) more of IL-8, MIP-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 inflammatory cytokines than the control. PBMC (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells) were cultured with and without 11.2nM S protein for 24 h and supernatants were assayed for cytokines by ELISA. Mean\u00b1 SE of three or more independent experiments is shown. P values were determined by student's t-test comparing S protein-treated and mock-treated control culture. TNF\u03b1 p=ns. Production and secretion of IL-8 was significantly increased in PBMC after treatment with S protein. The kinetics and dose response effect of S protein on in vitro PBMC 3, 6 and 9h after treatment with S protein (0.28, 2.8 and 5.6nM) were evaluated. Secreted IL-8 is expressed as pg/ml (mean \u00b1 SE of three separate experiments). Statistical significance was determined using the student's t-test based on comparison of S protein treated-with the mock-treated control for each time point. Our results indicated that S protein treatment increased IL-8 production in a dose dependent manner and that 5.6nM gave a statistically significant response compared to control. S protein but not E protein treatment increased IL-8 mRNA abundance and IL-8 production and secretion in PBMC. In vitro PBMC (2\u00d710 5 cells) were treated with S protein (0.28, 2.8, 5.6and 28nM) or E protein (0.5, 2.5 and 25nM) for 24 h. (A) RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed, cDNA amplified and IL-8 gene expression was determined by real time quantitative PCR. Relative expression of mRNA species was calculated using the comparative C T method. Statistical significance was determined using the student's t-test based on comparison with the mock-treated control for each dose. Significant differences in IL-8 mRNA abundance were observed when the PBMC were treated with S protein \u2265 5.6nM compared to control (p= 0.047, data of three separate experiments) while E protein did not increase IL-8 mRNA levels. (B) Secreted IL-8 concentrations at 24 h following S protein and E protein treatment of PBMC were determined by ELISA. IL-8 concentration increased in S proteintreated PBMC in proportion to mRNA abundance whereas secreted IL-8 did not increase in E protein-treated PBMC, compared to control. Effect of treatment with TPCK on the IL-8 response to S protein in PBMC and THP-1cells and in HCoV-229E-infected PBMC. PBMC or THP-1 cells were pretreated with 25\u03bcM TPCK for 20 min prior to addition of 11.2nM S protein. Secretion of IL-8 into culture supernatants after 24h of incubation was measured using ELISA: (A) In PBMC, in the presence of TPCK the response to S protein was reduced by 95% (p=0.024) (B) In THP-1 cells, in the presence of TPCK the response to S protein was reduced by 95%.(p=0.022). C) In HCoV-229E-infected PBMC, in the presence of TPCK the secretion of IL-8 was reduced by 51% at 6 h post infection and 34% at 8 h post infection (p=0.018). The data are from three independent experiments. Quantitation of the effect of S protein on the activation of NF-\u03baB. Nuclear proteins were extracted from PBMC or THP-1 cells treated with S protein (11.2nM) or mock-treated (control). To assay for activated NF-\u03baB, 1\u03bcg of the nuclear extract was added per well coated with NF-\u03baB consensus DNA sequence and the amount of active NF-\u03baB p65 bound after 1 h incubation was measured as luminescence units using EZ Detect NF-\u03baB p65 Transcription Factor Assay. Each bar represents of luminescence activity per \u03bcg nuclear extract (mean \u00b1 S.E from three independent experiments). The results show that in (A) PBMC and (B) THP-1 cells, treatment with S protein increased NF-\u03baB activity compared to controls. In THP-1 cells, TPCK pretreatment reduced NF-\u03baB binding activity in response to S protein by 62% (p=0.04) at 1 h post treatment and by 77% (p=0.008) at 4 h post treatment with S protein. S protein is a ligand for human TLR2. Cultures of (A) hTLR2-293, (B) 293 and (C) hACE2-293 cells (1\u00d710 6 cells) were stimulated with S(spike) protein (11.2\u03bcM), SARS pseudovirus (3\u00d710 5 RLU), supernatant from pSARS pHIV cotransfected 293 cells (3\u00d710 6 RLU), or infected with HCoV-229E (MOI = 1). Culture media were collected at 18 h and secreted IL-8 was measured by ELISA. Data are from two or more experiments. p= 0.03 for S protein compared with control in hTLR2-293 cells by the paired one-tailed t-test.",
