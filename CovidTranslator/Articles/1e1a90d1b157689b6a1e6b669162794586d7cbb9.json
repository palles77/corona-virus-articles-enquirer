For example, wheezing illnesses in children older than 2 years are most common in children who have rhinovirus infections together with allergic sensitization, nasal eosinophilia, or increased nasal eosinophil cationic protein levels. 4 Additional studies have identified increased expression of the Fc\u03b5RI receptor on monocytes and dendritic cells during acute asthma exacerbations. 5 One potential mechanism by which IgE could affect viral exacerbations relates to effects of the Fc\u03b5RI on interferon responses. In vitro experiments demonstrated that increased Fc\u03b5RI expression on plasmacytoid dendritic cells and IgE cross-linking strongly inhibited rhinovirus-induced interferon production in cells from children with allergic asthma. 6 Strengths of the current study include the longitudinal analysis of exacerbations over a 6-year period. Much of the current literature evaluates the cause of asthma exacerbations from a cross-sectional perspective and not prospectively over multiple years. The study is limited by the relatively small numbers of children in each group, particularly the groups with only viral and only nonviral exacerbations, and the fact that most of the children with asthma in this cohort study have relatively mild disease.",

Previous laboratory investigations have suggested that macrolides have in vitro antiviral activity because pretreatment of ex vivo human respiratory epithelial cells with AZM 5 or clarithromycin 6 reduced replication and release of RSV 6 and rhinovirus. 5 In addition, AZM pretreatment reduces rhinovirus replication in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells. 7 However, potential in vivo antiviral effects of macrolides have not been investigated in humans infected with respiratory viruses. Therefore, we hypothesized that our finding of AZM's reduction in post-RSV recurrent wheeze 4 was mediated, at least in part, by antiviral activity.",

Eligible infants were aged 1 to 18 months, otherwise healthy, and hospitalized for the first episode of bronchiolitis with confirmed RSV infection. Infants with a history of prematurity were excluded. Study treatments were either AZM oral suspension 10 mg/kg once daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily for 7 additional days, or an oral placebo suspension. AZM therapy was well tolerated as mild gastrointestinal adverse events (diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain) during the active treatment phase were recorded in 15 children (7 azithromycin, 8 placebo) ; none warranted discontinuation of study medication. 4 The study protocol was ",
