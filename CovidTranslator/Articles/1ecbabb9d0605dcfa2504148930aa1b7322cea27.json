Antigenspecific immunotherapy and the employment of proteasome inhibitors have emerged as two potentially plausible approaches for the control of cancer. In the current study, we explored the combination of the DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to human papillomavirus type 16 E7 antigen (CRT/E7) with the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, for their ability to generate E7-specific immune responses and antitumor effects in vaccinated mice. We found that the combination of treatment with bortezomib and CRT/E7(detox) DNA generated more potent E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and better therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors in tumor-bearing mice compared to monotherapy. Furthermore, we found that treatment with bortezomib led to increased apoptosis of TC-1 tumor cells and could render the TC-1 tumor cells more susceptible to lysis by E7-specific CD8+ T cells. Our data have significant implications for future clinical translation.",

Intradermal administration of CRT linked to any of these target antigens led to a significant increase in the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell (CTL) immune responses and impressive antitumor effects.

A second-generation plasmid from pNGVL-3, pNGVL4a, encodes a kanamycin-resistant gene and a transcription unit consisting of a cytomegalovirus promoter and multiple cloning site, followed by a poly-A tail. It contains two short immunostimulatory DNA sequences (ISS) in the noncoding region of the backbone. The ISS sequences are derived from a bacterial ampicillin-resistant gene and consist of tandem repeats of a CpG dinucleotide in the base context, 5\u2032-AACGTT-3\u2032. It has been demonstrated that an ISS-containing pDNA can elicit the production of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin 12 in transfected keratocytes and dermal antigen-presenting cells, which results in a potent T helper cell type 1 (Th1) response. This vector also contains a transcription unit that yields high levels of Ag expression and its DNA adjuvant unit elicits strong immunologic Th1 type responses against the pDNA-encoded protein. E7 oncogenic protein detox form has substituted amino acids at positions 24 (glycine in place of cysteine) and 26 (glycine in place of glutamic acid). These substitutions have been shown to inhibit E7 protein binding to pRb at position 11, abating E7's ability to transform cells. Thus, it is more adequately used in clinical trials.",

We also observed that treatment with bortezomib alone led to a higher degree of TC-1 tumor cell death compared to CTLs alone using the specified conditions for the in vitro study. However, the observed effect may depend on the concentration of bortezomib and/or the number of CTLs used in the in vitro killing assay.

Thus, the combination of treatment with bortezomib and CRT/E7 (detox) DNA represents a potentially innovative therapy for the control of E7-expressing tumors. We selected the HPV-16 E7 antigen for our DNA vaccine development in the current study. It is now clear that persistent infection with HPV is a primary factor in the development of cervical cancer [26] . HPV is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the world and HPV DNA has been detected in 99.7% of cervical cancers. Furthermore, HPV-16 is a \"high-risk\" type and is associated with more than 50% of all cervical cancers (for review, see [27] ). The HPV early viral protein E7 is a potentially ideal target antigen since it is a completely foreign antigen and is expressed early in viral infection. Furthermore, E7 is essential for transformation and is coexpressed in almost all HPV-associated cancer cells but not in normal cells. Thus, DNA vaccines targeting HPV-16 E7 antigen potentially can be used for the control of HPVassociated malignancies.",

In the current study, we administered bortezomib before the second DNA vaccination. This would increase the susceptibility of the treated TC-1 tumors without compromising the E7-specific CD8+ T cells since the first DNA vaccination in general does not result in significant number of proliferative antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (also see Fig. 3 ).

The apoptotic tumor cells may potentially be taken up by antigen-presenting cells, resulting in the activation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells (so called crosspriming mechanism). We have previously observed that treatment of the tumor with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) led to apoptotic tumor cell death, resulting in higher levels of E7 peptide-loaded dendritic cells in the draining lymph nodes of tumor-bearing mice [29] . This increase in the levels of E7 peptide-loaded dendritic cells resulted in an increased number of E7-specific CD8+ T cell precursors in treated mice. Thus, treatment with EGCG significantly boosted the potency of the CRT/E7 DNA vaccine, by enhancing the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and antitumor effects. Similarly, treatment with bortezomib also led to apoptotic tumor cell death, thus enhancing CRT/E7 DNA vaccine potency. Therefore, it would be of interest to observe if the degree of apoptotic cell death generated by these reagents correlates with the ability to enhance the DNA vaccine potency.",

            "text": "We observed that treatment with bortezomib rendered the E7-expressing TC-1 tumor cells more susceptible to killing by the E7-specific CD8+ T cells. Several mechanisms may account for the observed phenomenon. For example, bortezomib may lead to upregulation of MHC class I, resulting in increased recognition of antigenic In vitro cytotoxicity assay. Luciferase-expressing TC-1 tumor cells were added to 24-well plates at a dose of 1\u00d710 5 per well. Eighteen hours later, TC-1 tumor cells were treated with 16 nM bortezomib overnight followed by incubation with or without 1\u00d710 6 E7-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL). The E7-specific CD8+ T cells have been previously described [23] . Untreated TC-1 tumor cells and TC-1 cells treated with 1\u00d710 6 E7-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) alone were used as controls. The degree of CTL-mediated killing of the tumor cells was indicated by the decrease of luminescence activity using the IVIS luminescence imaging system series 2000. Bioluminescence signals were acquired for 15 s. a Representative luminescence images of 24-well plates showing lysis of the tumor cells. b Bar graph depicting the quantification of luminescence intensity in tumor cells treated with bortezomib and/or E7-specific cytotoxic T cells (mean\u00b1SE). Data shown are representative of two experiments performed peptide-MHC class I complex by E7-specific CD8+ T cells. However, we have characterized the expression of MHC class I and B-7 on TC-1 tumor cells following treatment with bortezomib. We did not find significant change in the levels of MHC class I and B-7 on TC-1 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, it has been reported that tumor cells treated with bortezomib does not lead to increased expression of MHC class I molecules [30] . Alternatively, treatment with bortezomib may lead to increased expression of E7 protein and/or death receptors (DR). It has been shown that renal cell carcinoma cells treated with bortezomib demonstrated upregulation of DR5 [30] . Furthermore, it has been reported that treatment of tumors with bortezomib can lead to the upregulation of molecules that may sensitize tumors for apoptotic cell death, such as Fas, rendering tumors more susceptible to immune cells expressing death ligands, such as FasL [31] .",

Thus, our data indicate that the sensitization of the tumor by bortezomib (presumably by upregulation of Fas on tumor cells) may contribute to the enhanced cytotoxic killing by E7-specific CD8+ T cells.
