            "text": "Entry of enveloped viruses into cells is initiated by binding of their envelope glycoproteins (Envs) to cell surface-associated receptors. The Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) has two Envs, Gn and Gc, with poorly understood role in binding to susceptible cells. We expressed codon optimized Gn and Gc, and identified independently folded soluble Env fragments, one of which (Gc residues 180-300) bound CCHFV susceptible cells supposedly by interacting with a putative receptor. This receptor binding domain (RBD) was used to identify its interacting partner by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Thus we identified the human cell surface nucleolin as a putative CCHFV entry factor. Nucleolin was expressed on all susceptible cells tested but not on the surface of cells resistant to CCHFV infection. Further studies are needed to explore the nucleolin function as a plausible CCHFV receptor and the molecular mechanisms of the Gc-nucleolin interactions. The identification of the CCHFV RBD and its binding partner could provide novel targets for therapy and tools for prevention as well as more complete understanding of the mechanisms of CCHFV entry and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-born disease caused by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a member of the genus Nairovirus within the family Bunyaviridae. This disease has wide-ranging symptoms such as high fever and diarrhea and in severe cases hemorrhagic symptoms with a fatality rate as high as 30%. Originally identified during an outbreak in Russia during the 1940s, it continues to cause sporadic outbreaks in Africa, Europe, and Asia [1, 2, 3] . It has been listed as a category C priority pathogen by CDC/NIAID. Treatment options for CCHF are limited partially due to the limited understanding of the pathogenesis of this virus [4] . In particular, the entry mechanism remains ambiguous because the potential roles played by the only two viral membrane proteins, Gn and Gc, in the entry process have yet to be elucidated. Furthermore, the human factor(s) involved in this process remains unknown. Attempts to resolve these issues have been impeded by the inability to express and purify soluble and functional Gn and Gc proteins. The only virus from the Bunyavirideae family with a putative human receptor(s) identified is Hantaan virus. Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was found to be one possible receptor through functional screening rather than the traditional biochemical approach often used for this purpose [5] . This same functional screening approach so far has not yielded any promising lead for CCHFV and other viruses in this family.",

It was found that they are both targeted to the Golgi body after expression and surface presentation is limited if any [6, 7] . Furthermore, soluble expression of their ecto-domains has been difficult. We cloned codon-optimized Gn and Gc of various lengths into the pSecTag expression vector and tested their expressions ( Figure 1A ). The full-length, matured Gn and Gc [8] , expressed efficiently, with Gc running as a smear in a conventional reducing SDS-PAGE gel. The full-length ecto-domains of both Gn and Gc without the transmembrane domains and regions C terminal to them also expressed efficiently. However, only Gn ecto-domain was secreted to the growth medium, whereas Gc ectodomain was retained inside the cells. Subsequent deletions revealed that residues 1-380 of the matured Gc constitute the largest soluble Gc fragment ( Figure 1B ). Computer analysis using the different programs including Kyte-Doolittle and Chou-Fasman suggested the existence of unusually high content of beta-strand secondary structure downstream of residue 380 (data not shown). This may be an indication of regions involved in membrane fusion after viral engagement of host cells.",

The Gn fragment used was Gn-ecto-Fc and the Gc fragment used was Gc-180-300-Fc. There was only one protein that was dominant in both coomassie blue-stained and streptavidin-HRP detected gels in the Gc-180-300-Fc sample. It had a size of approximately 110 kDa (Figure 3 ). There was also one specific protein immunoprecipitated by Gn, even though it was visible only by coomassie blue stain. Peptide sequencing of both proteins revealed that the protein immunoprecipitated by Gc-180-300-Fc was nucleolin, with 16 distinct peptides identified, representing more than 20% of the nucleolin sequence ( Table 1 ). The protein immunoprecipitated by Gn was a strictly cytoplasmic protein reflecting its lack of biotin labeling and was not pursued further (data not shown). To confirm the finding with nucleolin, biotin-labeling followed by immunoprecipitation was repeated in two CCHFV susceptible cell lines, SW-13 and 293T/17. The immunoprecipitation samples were analyzed by Western blot using both streptavidin-HRP and an anti-nucleolin antibody. Nucleolin was confirmed to be the only dominant protein species immunoprecipitated by Gc-Fc in both cell lines ( Figure 4A ). Since nucleolin is predominantly a nucleolar protein, we further tested its cell-surface expression by flow cytometry. Its surface expression was detected in all three cell lines with SW-13 having the highest expression level ( Figure 4B ). This is consistent with the previous finding that SW-13 cell line shows the most prominent cytopathic effect upon CCHFV infection by forming visible plaques and yielding the highest virus titer [9] .",

            "text": "The soluble expression of Gn and Gc of CCHFV has long been a bottleneck in studying their functions in CCHFV entry as well as their usages in developing vaccines and therapeutics. In this report, we extensively characterized the expression and solubility profiles of both Gn and Gc, and identified Gc as the primary binding moiety to human cells. Furthermore, we narrowed the potential receptor binding domain (RBD) to a Gc fragment slightly longer than 100 residues (Gc180-300). Using this fragment, we coimmunoprecipitated nucleolin, an extremely versatile protein found primarily in the nucleolus of eukaryotic cells.",

            "text": "The exact roles of Gn and Gc in CCHFV entry has not been clearly defined. Center to the debate is which of the two proteins is responsible for binding to the host cells and mediating the entry. For different genus in the Bunyaviridae family, it appears that either Gn, Gc or both could be involved [10] There is increasing evidence suggesting that Gc is the primary target-binding protein for CCHFV. Panels of monoclonal antibodies have been generated against both Gn and Gc and only those against Gc inhibited virus infection of susceptible cell lines but not those against Gn [6] . This is by far the clearest indication that Gc not only binds target cells but also mediates virus entry. Our findings that Gc seems to be divided into two halves, the first being the hydrophilic N terminal fragment including residues 1-380 and the second being the hydrophobic C terminal fragment including the rest of the Gc residues support this model. The identification of a potential RBD domain will greatly assist in the study of the cellular entry mechanism and the development of treatment of CCHFV as is seen with other emerging viruses [11] . The participation of Gn if any is yet to be determined. The success in soluble expression of both Gn and Gc provide the possibility to test their usefulness as subunit CCHFV vaccines. Protein therapeutics as well as diagnostics including neutralizing antibodies against these two proteins can now be developed, too.",
