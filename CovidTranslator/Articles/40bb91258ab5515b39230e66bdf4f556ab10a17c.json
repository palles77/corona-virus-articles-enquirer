Here, we demonstrated that sequence alterations in the coat protein (CP)-binding cis-acting RNA motifs, the Bbox region (in the intercistronic RNA3 sequence) and the RNA3 packaging element (PE, in the movement protein ORF), reduced crossover frequencies in protoplasts. Additionally, the modification of Bbox-like element in the 5 UTR region strongly debilitated crossovers. Along the lines of these observations, RNA3 mutants not expressing CP or expressing mutated CPs also reduced recombination. A series of reciprocal transfections demonstrated a functional crosstalk between the Bbox and PE elements. Altogether, our data imply the role of CP in sgRNA3a-directed recombination by either facilitating the interaction of the RNA substrates and/or by creating roadblocks for the viral replicase.",

The process of replicase-driven template switch is the most widely accepted mechanism of recombination (Ranjith-Kumar et al., 2002; Shapka and Nagy, 2004; Hu et al., 2003) . Highly structured cis-acting replication elements stall the progressing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex, which subsequently forces the dissociation of the replicase from the original template and promotes its re-initiation at the acceptor site on another template (Suzuki et al., 2003; Dedepsidis et al., 2010; Draghici and Varrelmann, 2010; Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011b) . Studies with Brome mosaic virus (BMV) demonstrated that the homologous crossovers occur near the secondary structures, e.g., within a 3 tRNA-like structure (TLS), which appear to serve as roadblocks for the progression of RdRp. Interestingly, the effects were more evident during (+)-strand synthesis (Olsthoorn et al., 2002) .",

The CP is expressed from subgenomic (sg) RNA4. The multipartite composition of BMV genome and the production of subgenomic RNAs make it a useful model for studies on RNA recombination.

Another motif is a highly structured position-dependent RNA3 packaging element PE that is localized between nucleotides (nts) 550 and 820 and is considered as a selective domain for CP interaction facilitating specific packaging of BMV RNA3 (Choi and Rao, 2003) . Since sgRNA3a represents an exact copy of the 5 half of (+) strand RNA3, it also carries these two cis-acting elements. In this work, we show that sequence alterations within both motifs, either on RNA3 and/or on the sgRNA3a components, diminished the recombination frequency in protoplasts. A series of reciprocal transfections revealed putative interactions between these motifs in establishing the crossover locations. Moreover, the transfection of protoplasts with the RNA mutants incapable of CP expression or that expressed the CP variants with altered domains recognizing the CP-binding motifs also reduced the recombination frequency. Our study offers novel insight into BMV RNA recombination and indicates that associations of CP with the RNA cis-acting motifs can mediate RNA recombination process.",

In our previous study, this particular substitution was Fig. 2 . The distribution of crossover sites between recombining RNA3 and sgRNA3a derivatives in co-transfected barley protoplasts. The RNA3/sgRNA3a inocula are indicated on the left of each transfection experiment panel (for further description of the RNA constructs, see Section 2). All RNA3 derivatives bear a point mutation (A to U) at nt position 2 near the 5 end (black square) to lower the production of (+) sense RNA3. The positions of marker restriction sites are indicated below each construct. The column on the right shows the number of recombinants bearing the indicated restriction marker sites identified among 100 insert-bearing cDNA clones; the rest of cDNA clones represented the wt input RNA3 sequence. These numbers are repeated inside the shaded rectangles (for recombinants with single markers) or above the brackets (for recombinants with multiple markers). The numbers summarize the results from two independent transfection experiments per each combination of the inoculated RNA substrates. To calculate total recombination frequency, the number of all recombinant-bearing clones should be summarized and divided by 100. Total protoplast RNA was extracted after 48 h post inoculation, separated on a 1.2% denaturing agarose gel, blotted and probed with the 3 RNA probe (see Section 2).

These marker mutations allowed mapping of the recombination sites within the 5 region of RNA3 and were present in all the sgRNA3-derived constructs used in this work (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a) . The PE-RNA3 and PE-SG constructs were co-transfected (together with wt RNA1 and 2) into barley protoplasts ( Fig. 2A) . Only three recombinant clones were identified among 100 RT-PCR-generated cDNA clones, thus the recombination frequency (3%) was greatly reduced as compared to the previously published results for mut-RNA3 and SG co-transfection (42%) (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a). The control amplifications did not show RT-PCR generated recombinants (see Section 2). The three characterized clones all caried the 5 -most BamHI marker mutation which implied that the residual RNA3-sgRNA3a crossovers occurred within the regions 5 upstream to PE element.",

Overall, when compared with the 42% frequency between mut-RNA3 and SG, the lack of functional PE in RNA3 effectively reduced the recombination frequency to a marginal value, demonstrating the importance of the PE motif.

The CP domains responsible for the binding to Bbox and SLC motifs were mapped (Yi et al., 2009b) . To address whether the absence of CP affects sgRNA3a-RNA3 recombination, CP0-RNA3 was created. CP0-RNA3 did not transcribe sgRNA4 due to mutations introduced within the sgRNA4 promoter region (+1 G to C and \u22122 A to C), as previously reported (Sivakumaran et al., 2004) , and thus in the above system the expression of CP is debilitated. The results of disrupted sgRNA4 transcription along with an unaffected level of RNA3 accumulation in protoplasts are shown in Fig. 3 (compare lanes 12 and 13) . Among four identified recombinants (per 100 analyzed cDNA clones), three acquired a complete set of SG-derived restriction markers, while one clone inherited only the central HindIII and the 3 PstI sites (Fig. 2E ).

Since the PE binding domain was not mapped on BMV CP molecule, the corresponding amino acids could not be mutated. Two CP derivatives were generated: the CP-Bbox mutant carrying alanine substitutions for residues T145, D148, N151, Y155, Y157, S159, V162, P163 and K165, and the CP-SLC variant carrying alanine substitutions for residues V27, P29, V30, V32, P34, Q39 and K41. To examine recombination frequency, both RNA3 CP mutants were co-transfected separately with SG in barley protoplasts. The CP-Bbox RNA3 generated the following recombinants: three carrying all sgRNA3a marker restriction sites (likely reflecting sgRNA3a extension on progeny RNA3), one carrying the 5 BamHI and the 3 PstI sites, and one carrying only the 5 BamHI site (Fig. 2F ). In the case of CP-SLC RNA3, only one recombinant emerged, containing the inner HindIII site (Fig. 2G ).

Various combinations of the transcribed genomic RNA3 and sgRNA3a radioactive variants were co-transfected into barley protoplasts along with unlabeled RNA1 and 2. The protoplasts were thoroughly washed to remove the untransfected radioactive material, and the total RNA was extracted at three time points. The stabilities of the RNA3 and sgRNA3a variants were assessed in comparison with the previously tested wt RNA3 and wt sgRNA3a transcripts. All of the transcript variants were stable to a similar degree within the 75 min assay time (Fig. 4) , indicating that the observed frequencies during the protoplast assays reflected recombination rates rather than altered RNA stability.",

Equimolar concentrations of serially diluted (1; 1:10; 1:100; 1:1000) radioactive wt or mutated RNA3 probes (comprising the regions of individual cis-acting sequences, as shown on top of Fig. 5 ), were incubated with equimolar wt or mutated CP preparations. The complexes were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, washed, and the bound radioactivity was determined via autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 5 , the wt CP bound efficiently to wt and mutated full-length RNA3 probes (top section), as well as to wt PE (wt PE Fr) and to wt Bbox (wt Bbox Fr) RNA3 fragments (Fig. 5, second section, lines 1 and 2) , because the interaction was at the detectable level even with 1:1000 diluted probe. This reflected the fact that more than one CP peptides were found to be cross-linked to the BMV RNAs by using the reversible cross-linking and peptide fingerprinting (RCAP) assays (Yi et al., 2009b) . However, the deleted PE ( PE Fr) and mutated Bbox (mut Bbox Fr) RNA3 fragments interacted at least 100 fold less efficiently with wt CP (Fig. 5, second section, lines 3 and 4 , respectively) as the 1:10 diluted probes barely generated detectable signal. Likewise, the CP variant with mutated peptide recognizing Bbox motif (CP-Bbox) also bound inefficiently to both PE Fr and mut Bbox Fr probes (Fig. 5, third section, lines 3 and 4, respectively) and to an increased (three-fold) amount of wt Bbox Fr probe (line 1), yet binding to wt PE Fr was reasonably high (Fig. 5, line 2) . This analysis revealed separate PE and Bbox binding sites on the CP molecule, which is consistent with the previously published data of Yi et al. (2009b) . The CP-SLC mutant bound with relative efficiency to both wt PE and Bbox Fr (Fig. 5 , bottom section, lines 1 and 2) but it bound with much less efficiency to the PE and Bbox mutated counterparts (Fig. 5, lines 3 and 4) . Collectively, our data suggest that all three RNA3 motifs interact with separate regions on the BMV CP molecule, and confirm that the inhibition of CP binding parallels the diminished RNA3-sgRNA3a recombination frequency.",

The mut-RNA3 \u00d7 SG experiment generated only six recombinants with more random distribution of three markers; thirteen carrying BamHI-PstI double markers; one and two carrying (respectively) BamHI-HindIII or HindIII-PstI double markers; and eleven, one, and eight carrying (respectively) PstI, HindIII, or BamHI single markers. This suggested that crossovers happened near the 3 end of sgRNA3a or more internally, likely near the PE encapsidation region. Based on prior and current studies we speculated that recombination occurred by two mechanisms (Fig. 6A and B) : (1) sgRNA3a-directed primer extension on (\u2212) strand RNA3, where the exposed 3 terminal regions of sgRNA3a would promote the template switch during (+) strand RNA synthesis, or by (2) strand switching between (+) strands [during (\u2212) strand synthesis] which could engage internal secondary structures of RNA3 and sgRNA3a. Here, the sgRNA3a would act as a \"docking partner\" that anneals to the newly synthesized (\u2212) sense RNA3. Both, the BMV RdRp capability to participate in primer extension with sgRNA3a on (\u2212) RNA3 templates as well as its potency to switch among RNA templates were demonstrated previously in vitro (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a) .",

Our recent data (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a) suggested that the RNA3 position-dependent packaging element (PE) (Choi and Rao, 2003; Annamalai and Rao, 2006) focuses the RNA3-sgRNA3a crossovers. It was shown that removal of PE did not inhibit RNA3 accumulation in barley protoplasts (Choi and Rao, 2003) . Here, we confirm that the deletion of a large portion of PE did not affect replication of RNA3 in protoplasts (Fig. 3) but it strongly debilitated recombination (transfection PE-RNA3 \u00d7 SG supported only 3% recombination frequency; Fig. 2A) . Similarly, the PE-RNA3 \u00d7 PE-SG transfection, in which both constructs were missing the PE motif, generated only three recombinants, all carrying the 5 BamHI marker mutation. In contrast, when the same PE motif was deleted only in sgRNA3a (transfection Bbox-RNA3 \u00d7 PE-SG), this alteration was much less debilitating for recombination (reduction to 13%), likely as a combined effect with the mutated Bbox element (Fig. 2C ) that was shown to increase recombination.",

Previously, it was shown that partial PE deletion eliminated RNA3 packaging (Choi and Rao, 2003) . Since PE is functional only in (+) strands we speculate that the lack of CP binding to this motif might disrupt the initial interaction between the (+) strands of RNA3 and sgRNA3a, which in normal conditions would be supported via CP-CP dimerization/oligomerization. BMV CP ability to bind small RNA motifs together with RdRp was previously proposed to regulate the timing of BMV RNA synthesis and viral encapsidation (Zhu et al., 2007) . Additionally, BMV CP was shown to co-purify with BMV replicase (Bujarski et al., 1982) , and both BMV CP and viral RNAs were found to co-localize at viral \"replication factories\" (Bamunusinghe et al., 2011; Schwartz et al., 2004; Diaz et al., 2012; Seo et al., 2012) . The bound CP might then support RNA crossovers during replication inside the factories. In addition, the bound CP might create obstacles for the replicase complex and promote strand switching.",

In our studies, the Bbox mutations debilitated recombination, but while occurring in sgRNA3a rather than in RNA3 (Fig. 2B) .

In addition, the sgRNA3a-bound CP might interact with the replicase complex that is already present at the subgenomic promoter, which would also facilitate primer extension. At the same time, CP binding at the internal RNA3 Bbox motif would create an obstacle for progressing RdRp supporting the inner strand switching process. In addition, the presence of the polyA tail in sgRNA3a primer might be essential. We have demonstrated that BMV RdRp can initiate at the polyA tail of sgRNA3a in vitro (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a) .",

The transfection with PE-RNA3 \u00d7 Bbox-SG practically eliminated recombination (Fig. 2C ) which might be due to missing PE in RNA3. Along these lines, a reverse transfection with Bbox-RNA3 \u00d7 PE-SG generated recombinants that carried all three sgRNA3a markers; again reflecting the sgRNA3a-directed primer extension on (\u2212) templates. Since the Bbox-RNA3 \u00d7 PE-SG experiment supported the crossovers near the 3 end of sgRNA3a we conclude that the unmodified sgRNA3a Bbox structure supported primer extension due to binding to both BMV CP and BMV replicase proteins. Additionally, the lack of CP binding to the modified Bbox in RNA3 likely removes the road block for BMV replicase, and thus prevents the RdRp from inner strand switching. The results from the Bbox-RNA3 \u00d7 SG co-transfection experiment (76% recombinants with all three marker sites) agree with the lines of this hypothesis.",

Analogous motif was also reported at the 5 UTR of RNA3 (Pogue et al., 1992) ; however, its CP-binding activity was not reported. Here we show that mutations in the Bbox like element did not affect the level of RNA3 (+) strands in protoplasts (Fig. 3) . Similar observations were reported by Pogue et al. (1992) after deleting the 5 Bbox like sequence from BMV RNA3. Apparently, this region does not participate in the initiation of RNA3 (+) strands. However, two cotransfections involving RNA3 and/or sgRNA3a 5 box-like mutants (5 box-RNA3 \u00d7 5 box-SG and 5 box-RNA3 \u00d7 SG) dramatically debilitated recombination (none and one recombinant, respectively, per 100 clones; Fig. 2D ). These results complement our previously published low recombination rates with the 3 -nested sgRNA3a derivatives that were lacking the 5 Bbox-like motif (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska et al., 2011a) . The effect of the disruption of the 5 Bbox-like sequence on sgRNA3a-RNA3 recombination might be due to changes in the entire topology (structure and/or communication with other motifs) of the recombining RNAs, making them less prone to crossovers. These possibilities will be a subject of further experimentation.",

Similar to CP-Bbox, the recombination frequency with CP-SLC was very low after co-transfecting with wt sgRNA3a (Fig. 2G) . Collectively, these observations revealed that either the lack of CP or the disrupted binding of CP molecules to their cognate RNA binding signals debilitated significantly the recombination activity. One can speculate that the 3 SLC-bound CP increases the interaction between sgRNA3a and RNA3 molecules via long distance oligomerization (dashed arrow in Fig. 6B ). Under this scenario, the strand switching during (\u2212) strand synthesis could be facilitated. Alternatively, the 3 SLC-bound CP could boost the (\u2212) strand synthesis (Chapman and Kao, 1999) , which would increase the frequency of strand switching.",

This was observed for point mutations within the Bbox element, for a large deletion within the PE region, as well as for CP amino acid substitutions within binding domains to Bbox and 3 -SLC elements. These observations confirm previous reports of Yi et al. (2009b) and Choi and Rao (2003) . Most importantly, the strength of CP binding directly correlates with the recombination frequency, which further supports the predictions on the important contribution the CP plays during homologous recombination.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our data reveal important role of CP in homologous BMV RNA recombination and both mechanisms, the sgRNA3a-mediated primer extension and internal strand switching. As regarding the biological meaning of homologous crossovers with subgenomic components, these mechanisms can serve as an efficient strategy that RNA viruses may use to diversify their RNA genomes and/or to guard the integrity of viral genome. It allows them to not only shuffle their genes so to adjust to ever-changing environment, but also to exploit subgenomic components as potential backup in case of extensive damage of their replication-competent genomic RNAs. The fact that BMV utilizes its multifunctional CP to orchestrate recombination proves once more the economical nature of virus life cycle under the limited resources. It is possible that CP-mediated recombination might be a common process among (+) stranded RNA viruses. The accumulating evidence demonstrates close proximity of viral RNA replication and CP translation inside the host cell (Annamalai et al., 2008; Seo et al., 2012) . Thus, it is tempting to assume that RNA recombination processes are linked not only spatially but also they share protein factors. Yet, further studies are necessary to define more details of these mechanisms.",

The individual CP/RNA combinations are indicated on the left-hand side, whereas the dilutions of the radioactive RNA probes are marked on the top. The location of marker restriction sites on sgRNA3a component is depicted as short vertical thin lines. The positions of PE, Bbox and SLC cis-acting elements known to bind BMV CP are marked by arrows above RNA3 molecule. The RNA3 fragments used as radioactive binding probes are represented by short black lines under sgRNA3a molecule and marked as PE Fr or B-box Fr, respectively. In addition, the regions of the amino acid substitutions in the SLC CP and Bbox CP mutants are shown as black dots right below the CP ORF of RNA3.",

            "text": "Schematic models for proposed participation of CP molecules during recombination between BMV sgRNA3a and RNA3 during plus (model A) and minus (model B) strand syntheses. (A) Model of primer extension of sgRNA3a on (\u2212) RNA3 templates. The BMV RdRp complex primes the hybridized sgRNA3a molecule and continues its translocation until completion on (\u2212) RNA3 template. Both the Bbox element and the polyA tail facilitate the binding of 1a/2a proteins while the bound CP molecules (small blue hexagons) can bridge over with the RdRp complex bound to the subgenomic RNA promoter on (\u2212) strand template. The CP binding might also loosen the original contact of the sgRNA3a/1a-2a complex. The 3 polyA tail and the corresponding internal polyU track are shown on the (+) and (\u2212) strands, respectively. The 1a and 2a proteins of the RdRp complex are represented as shaded ovals. The polyA-polyU hybridization is represented as vertical dotted lines, whereas the red dotted line demonstrates the polymerase-priming events. (B)The strand-switching model during (\u2212) strand synthesis. The binding of multimeric BMV CPs (represented by blue hexagons) to the PE sites (represented by two stem-loop structures) or to the intergenic Bbox motif sites (represented by single stem-loop structure) brings together both sgRNA3a and RNA3 (+) strand substrates via CP oligomerization. As yet another possibility, CP molecules bind to the stem loop C (SLC) at the 3 tRNA-like structure of the BMV RNA3 (+) strand and interact in trans with PE or Bbox sites in sgRNA3a, again bringing both molecules to a closer vicinity. The RdRp initiates the (\u2212) strand synthesis at the 3 end of RNA3, and switches templates onto the sgRNA3a (+) strand at the CP-PE or CP-Bbox road-block bridges.",
