However, SARS-CoV M protein is co-localized almost entirely with S, E, or NC protein when co-expressed in the cells. On the other hand, only partial co-localization was observed when S and E, S and NC, or E and NC were co-expressed in the cells. Interactions between SARS-CoV M and other structural proteins but not interactions between S and E, S and NC, or E and NC were further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assay. These results indicate that SARS-CoV M protein, similar to the M proteins of other coronaviruses, plays a pivotal role in virus assembly. The cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of SARS-CoV M protein was responsible for binding to NC protein. Multiple regions of M protein interacted with E and S proteins. A model for the interactions between SARS-CoV M protein and other structural proteins is proposed. This study helps us better understand protein-protein interactions during viral assembly of SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new infectious disease typically associated with fever, shortness of breath, cough, and pneumonia, first emerged in southern China in November 2002. Within months of the outbreak, SARS had spread globally, affecting over 8,000 patients in 29 countries with 774 fatalities [1] . The etiology of SARS is associated with a newly discovered coronavirus, SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] [3] [4] . SARS-CoV infects many organs, including lungs, liver, and immune cells [5, 6] . Subsequent studies have indicated that the SARS-CoV is of animal origin [7] , and its precursor is still present in animal populations within the region. Although the global outbreak of SARS has been contained, there are serious concerns over its re-emergence. To date, no specific treatment exists for this disease. Thus, further basic and clinical research is required to control the disease.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV is phylogenetically distinct, and only distantly related to the other coronavirus clades [8, 9] . Coronaviruses are exceptionally large RNA viruses and employ complex regulatory mechanisms to express their genomes [10] . The genome structure, gene expression pattern and protein profiles of SARS-CoV are similar to those of other coronaviruses. Nine SARS-CoV specific mRNAs were synthesized in virus-infected cells [11] . These RNA were predicted to encode 4 structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins), 16 non-structural proteins, and 8 accessory proteins. Previous studies on various coronaviruses indicated that the four structural proteins (S, E, M, and NC) play roles in virion morphogenesis [12, 13] . NC binds to viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid. Co-expression of M and E proteins together can form virus-like particles [14, 15] . Interactions between the M and E proteins and nucleocapsids result in virus budding through the cellular membrane [16] . Through the interaction with M protein, S protein is incorporated into the viral envelope [17, 18] and the mature virions are released from the cells. These studies suggest that coronavirus M protein [19, 20] plays a crucial role in the assembly of virus particles. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV assembles at and buds into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment [21] . Accumulation of the viral envelope proteins at this compartment is a prerequisite for virus assembly [22] . Immuno-EM (electron microscopy) revealed that budding occurred at membranes of the ERGIC and the Golgi region Cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing M-V5, the plasmid expressing myc-E protein, the plasmid expressing NC protein, or the plasmid expressing S protein. After transfection, cells were fixed and stained with mouse anti-V5, mouse anti-myc, rabbit anti-NC, rabbit anti-S antibodies. Green color, M, NC, S, or E protein staining; blue color, DAPI staining Fig. 2 (a) Co-localization of SARS-CoV M protein with S, E, or NC protein when co-expressed in Vero E6 cells. Cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing the M-V5 and NC (upper), S (middle), or myc-E (lower) proteins. After transfection, cells were fixed and stained with rabbit anti-NC and mouse anti-V5 antibodies (upper), or rabbit anti-S and mouse anti-V5 antibodies (middle), or mouse antimyc and goat anti-mouse conjugated with Cy3 followed by anti-V5-FITC antibody (lower). Green color, M protein staining; red color, NC (or S, or E) protein staining; blue color, DAPI staining; yellow color, co-localization of M and other structural proteins. (b) Partial co-localization of E and NC, S and NC, or E and S proteins when they were co-expressed in Vero E6 cells. Cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing myc-E and NC proteins (upper); S and myc-NC proteins (middle), and myc-E and S proteins (lower). After transfection, cells were fixed and stained with rabbit anti-NC (or anti-S) and mouse anti-myc antibodies c as early as 3 h post infection, demonstrating that SARS-CoV replicated surprisingly fast. Previous data also suggests that SARS-CoV established replication complexes at ER-derived membranes [21] . Later on, viral nucleocapsids were transported to the budding sites in the Golgi region where the viral glycoproteins accumulate and particle formation occurs. Assembly of SARS-CoV RNA packaging signal into virus-like particles is nucleocapsid dependent [23] . In this report, the protein-protein interactions among SARS-CoV structural proteins were studied using confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting analysis. Results from this study indicate that, similar to the M protein of other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV M protein plays a crucial role in the interactions between SARS-CoV structural proteins.",

The immunoprecipitated pellet was boiled for 10 min in sampling buffer and then analyzed by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blotting. In each experiment, 10% of cell lysates were used for expression analysis (by Western blotting assay directly) while 90% of cell lysates were used for the co-immunoprecipitation assay [25] .",

Therefore, treatments at room temperature were used for antigen preparation (sample buffer containing 50 mM of Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mM dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol, without boiling) to detect the expression of SARS-CoV M protein. A 4.5% acrylamide stacking gel and 12% separating gel were used in this study. When proteins with smaller size were analyzed (e.g., membrane protein deletion mutants), a 15% separating gel was used. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was transferred to PVDF paper (Pall Corporation, NY, USA).

The Cterminal fragment from amino acids 171-221 of M protein was truncated first. As shown in Fig. 5a while the first transmembrane region (amino acids was stabilized by interaction with the other transmembrane segments [25] . To determine whether the second or third transmembrane region alone interacted with E protein, these two transmembrane regions were fused with the first 115 amino acids of HCV core protein separately [25] . As shown in Fig. 5b , the second or the third transmembrane region of M protein alone was sufficient to bind E protein. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of M protein (i.e. M protein without its first 100 amino acids) also interacted with E protein (Fig. 5c) . In this case, the unglycosylated, but not glycosylated, E protein was preferentially immunoprecipitated. Co-localization between the cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of M protein and E protein was also demonstrated (middle panel, Fig. 7) . The M mutant constructs were also used to map the binding region(s) of M protein with S protein. As shown in Fig. 6a , M protein containing only amino acids 51-170 interacted with S protein. M protein without this region also interacted with S protein (Fig. 6b) . Again, the cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of M protein was also sufficient to interact with S protein (Fig. 6c) . These results suggest that multiple regions within M protein interacted with S protein. Co-localization between the cytoplasmic Cterminus domain of M protein and S protein was also demonstrated (lower panel of Fig. 7) . (Fig. 1) , similar to the results of a previous report [30] . SARS-CoV M protein co-localized almost entirely with S, E, or NC proteins when they were co-expressed within the cells (Fig. 2a) . On the other hand, only partial co-localization was observed when S and E, S and NC, or E and NC were co-expressed in the cells (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, the interactions between M and the other structural proteins were demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3) . The interactions of E and S, E and NC, NC and S proteins were not demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation ( Supplementary Fig. 1) . These results suggest that SARS-CoV M protein plays a pivotal role in virus assembly. Interactions of S and E, S and NC, or E and NC could occur after binding with M protein.",

Due to the topology of these two proteins, M protein is supposed to interact with NC through its cytoplasmic C-terminus domain. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4 , only the C-terminus domain of M protein residing in the cytoplasm interacted with NC protein. The result that three M deletion mutants (M protein without amino acids 101-135, 136-170, or 171-221) interacted with NC protein (Fig. 4d) suggests that almost the entire C-terminus domain of M protein is responsible for the interaction with NC protein. Our results agree with those of previous reports using in vitro GST pull-downed assays [34] or yeast twohybrid and surface plasmon resonance techniques [35] to study the interactions between SARS-CoV M and NC proteins. That at least two transmembrane domains and the cytoplasmic domain of M protein are sufficient for the interacting with E protein (Fig. 5) suggest extensive interactions between these two proteins. Compared with other constructs, the cytoplasmic C-terminus domain of M protein preferentially immunoprecipitated unglycosylated, but not glycosylated, E protein (Fig. 5c ). This result supports a previously reported model for the topology of E protein [36] : unglycosylated E protein leaves both its Nand C-termini in the cytoplasm while glycosylated E protein leaves both its N-and C-termini in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.",
