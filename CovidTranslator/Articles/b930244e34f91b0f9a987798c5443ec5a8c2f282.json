Conventional treatments against influenza include two classes of pathogen-targeting antivirals: M2 ion channel blockers (such as amantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (such as oseltamivir). Examination of the mechanism of influenza viral infection has shown that endosomal acidification plays a major role in facilitating the fusion between viral and endosomal membranes. This pathway has led to investigations on vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) activity, whose role as a regulating factor on influenza virus replication has been verified in extensive genome-wide screenings. Blocking v-ATPase activity thus presents the opportunity to interfere with influenza viral infection by preventing the pH-dependent membrane fusion between endosomes and virions. This study aims to apply diphyllin, a natural compound shown to be as a novel v-ATPase inhibitor, as a potential antiviral for various influenza virus strains using cell-based assays. The results show that diphyllin alters cellular susceptibility to influenza viruses through the inhibition of endosomal acidification, thus interfering with downstream virus replication, including that of known drug-resistant strains. In addition, combinatorial treatment of the host-targeting diphyllin with pathogen-targeting therapeutics (oseltamivir and amantadine) demonstrates enhanced antiviral effects and cell protection in vitro.",

            "text": "An influenza pandemic poses a serious threat to humans and animals, and it has incurred great financial and societal cost for decades. The most common pathogens causing influenza in humans are type A influenza viruses (seasonal H1N1, pandemic H1N1 and H3N2) and type B influenza viruses. Conventional treatments against the disease include two classes of antivirals: M2 ion channel blockers adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir, peramivir, zanavir and laninamivir) (Ison, 2011; Lee and Yen, 2012) . These two categories are designed to target viral proteins, thereby interfering with the virus' infection mechanisms. However, the emergence of new influenza viral strains carrying drug resistant mutations that can outpace the development of pathogentargeting antivirals presents a major clinical challenge. Most circulating influenza A viruses show resistance to adamantanes (Ison, 2011; Jackson et al., 2011; Lee and Yen, 2012; Moscona, 2009) , and intrinsic resistance to the compound has also been observed in Influenza B (Ison, 2011) . In addition, beginning with the 2007-2008 influenza season, circulating seasonal H1N1 viruses possessing the oseltamivir resistance mutation (His275Tyr) have been observed (Lackenby et al., 2008) . Since the first reported case of pandemic H1N1 in 2009, oseltamivir-resistant variant strains have also been identified. (Baz et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2009; Speers et al., 2010; Storms et al., 2012) . The rapid development of antiviral resistance highlights the need for alternative therapeutic strategies.",

Vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) activity, which is responsible for pumping protons into endosomal compartments, has been identified as a requirement for influenza virus replication in previous studies (Guinea and Carrasco, 1995; Muller et al., 2011; Perez and Carrasco, 1994) . V-ATPase-encoding genes have also been identified in several genomewide screens for host factors regulating influenza virus replication, and the knockdown of v-ATPase subunits has been shown to result in significant inhibition of influenza virus replications (Chin and Brass, 2012; Hao et al., 2008; Karlas et al., 2010; Konig et al., 2010; Mehle and Doudna, 2010) . Blocking v-ATPase activity, therefore, presents an opportunity to impede influenza infection by preventing the low pH-dependent membrane fusion between endosomes and virions. In addition to influenza viruses, flaviviruses (Pierson and Diamond, 2012) , vaccinia viruses (Townsley et al., 2006) , rhabdoviruses (Albertini et al., 2012) , and coronaviruses (Belouzard et al., 2012) also enter target cells in a pH-dependent fashion.",

By including an old v-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, as a control in two key functional assays, a similar cellular mechanism of action between diphyllin and bafilomycin A1 was observed. A wide variety of structurally inhibitors have been discovered, including benzolactone enamides salicylihalamide, lobatamide A and B, apicularen, indolyls, oximidine, macrolactone archazolid, lobatamide C, cruentaren, diphyllin and recently reported synthetic compounds, such as FR202126 and SB 242784 (Huss and Wieczorek, 2009; Niikura, 2006; Perez-Sayans et al., 2009 ). Many of these v-ATPase inhibitors have been previously evaluated for their antiviral activity against influenza viruses (Guinea and Carrasco, 1995; Muller et al., 2011; Ochiai et al., 1995) , rhinoviruses (Suzuki et al., 2001) , and dengue viruses (Duan et al., 2008) . Even though some of the classical v-ATPase inhibitors exhibited potent inhibitory effect against influenza viruses, the high toxicity of these compounds made them unsuitable for clinical applications (Drose and Altendorf, 1997; Niikura, 2006) . In Muller's study (2011) , for instance, bafilomycin A1 showed limited therapeutic efficacy in vivo despite significant viral inhibition in vitro . Implicated to have an unselective action mechanism, bafilomycin A1 exhibited high toxicity and inflicted liver and spleen damages at a 350 ng/kg. In contrast, a structurally distinctive saliphenylhalamide, demonstrated effective in vivo antiviral effect in mice and was well tolerated at a dose of 7 mg/kg. The improved antiviral effect/toxicity profile of saliphenylhalamide was attributed to a more selective v-ATPase inhibiting mechanism and highlights a major factor for consideration in therapeutic applications of v-ATPase inhibitors. Regarding diphyllin in the present study, compound safety has been demonstrated in a previous report (Shen et al., 2011) , in which daily treatment in mice at a dose of 20 mg/kg was tolerated for 10 days without significant signs of toxicity. Structurally, both saliphenylhalamide and (diphyhyllin fall into the class of benzolactones. It should be noted, however, that saliphenylhalamide is a lactone of salicylic acid, and diphyllin is a lactone of naphthoic acid, and saliphenylhalamide contains a macrocyclic N-acyl enamine functional group that has been shown to be required for potent v-ATPase activity (Lebreton et al., 2008) , whereas diphyllin has no such functional group. Owing to the multiple isoforms of v-ATPase expressed in a tissue-specific manner (Toei et al., 2010) , the therapeutic usefulness of v-ATPase inhibitors relies on the selectivity in the inhibition (Niikura, 2006) . Although the tissue or isoforms specific inhibition of diphyllin has yet been determined, diphyllin in this study demonstrates a safe therapeutic window in two types of mammalian cell lines with IC 50 values against viruses in the nanomolar range (38-632 nM), and the cellular cytotoxicity in the micromolar range (3-24 M), suggesting a potential role for further in vivo studies. We believe broadspectrum antiviral agents of high potency and low toxicity may be further developed through the existing compounds or derivatives.",

In this study, besides the laboratory H1N1 strain A/PuertoRico/8/34 (PR8) which is resistant to amantadine (Scholtissek and Faulkner, 1979) (had a IC 50 of amantadine higher than 22 M), we tested avian influenza A (H6N1) virus and five more types/subtypes of virus strains (Table 1) , including an H1N1 oseltamivir-resistant clinical isolate A/San Diego/21/2008 (had a IC 50 of oseltamivir higher than 40 M). The results clearly showed that diphyllin demonstrated CPE protection and inhibited . influenza viral replication against multiple types/subtypes, including the drug-resistant strains. To further investigate the spectrum of antiviral activities of diphyllin, we extended use of diphyllin to the context of dengue virus, another emerging human pathogen that shares a similar pH-dependent virus entry mechanism as influenza viruses (Pierson and Diamond, 2012) . The results showed that diphyllin interfered with dengue virus replication in cells, supporting the notion that diphyllin possesses a host-targeting, strain-independent mechanism of inhibition. Also, multiple methods were used in this study to evaluate diphyllin's effect, including the assay of infectivity, investigation of viral mRNA transcription by qRT-PCR and protein expression by western blot, examination of GFP expression as a surrogate read-out for virus replication, CPE protection, and quantification of extracellular virus particles using HA tests, all of which corroborated the antiviral effect of diphyllin.",

The combination of diphyllin and admantadine showed an enhanced inhibitory effect on both the virus expression and the CPE protection. Given that amantadine functions by inhibiting a proton-pump on viral antigens (Ciampor et al., 1992) , thereby regulating vesicular pH in an analogous fashion to diphyllin, the cooperativity between amantadine and diphyllin is presumably due to a more complete inhibition of endosomal acidification that occurred when the two drugs were combined. On the other hand, since diphyllin takes effect at an early stage of the replication cycle (virus fusion/uncoating) while oseltamivir takes effect at a later stage of the replication cycle (release of virons from infected cells), combining these two drugs was hypothesized to result in a synergistic action. As expected, viral protein expression and HA titer were significantly reduced when combinations of these two drugs were given as compared to single-drug treatments. Enhanced activity of oseltamivir on CPE protection was also observed in combination with diphyllin. It was reported that cell-based assays had less advantages than the direct enzymatic measurement of NA for monitoring susceptibility to the NA inhibitors (Tisdale, 2000) . In our experimental setting, however, we aimed to compare the combinatorial effect of diphyllin with the NA inhibitor, rather than to measure the susceptibility of viruses to certain NA inhibitors. Moreover, due to the different sensitivity of assay methods utilized in this study, the doses of compound combinations were pre-optimized to reflect a dynamic range that demonstrated appreciable interactions between the different compounds. For instance, higher doses of compounds were used in the western blot and the HA test from Fig. 7A as compared to those used in the CPE assay from Fig. 7B .",

In addition, antiviral effect of amantadine has been demonstrated in equine influenza (Timoney, 1996; van Maanen and Cullinane, 2002) , and it possesses therapeutic value in veterinary medicine.
