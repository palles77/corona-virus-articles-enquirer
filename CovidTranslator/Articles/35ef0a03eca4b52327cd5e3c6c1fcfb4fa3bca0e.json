After returning to earth, the seeds were germinated and grown to maturity. The parallel ground-based seeds were also planted under the same conditions. The leaves of licorice were used for inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) analysis and the two main secondary metabolites in one-year-old roots were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Among 22 random primers used in this experiment, 6 primers generated different DNA band types. Analysis of HPLC showed that the content of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) and liquiritin (LQ) in the roots from seeds flown in space was respectively 2.19, 1.18 times higher than that of the control group. The results demonstrated that the extraterrestrial environment induced mutagenic effects on licorice and affected its secondary metabolites. These changes indicated that extraterrestrial orbit is possible means of breeding of licorice so as to preserve this endangered medicinal plant.",

The two principal active secondary metabolites in licorice roots are glycyrrhizic acid (GA, including glycyrrhetinic acid, hydrolyzed products of GA, GCA) and liquiritin (LQ) (structure shown in Figure 1 ). GA has anti-inflammatory activity and is well known for its clinical applications in the treatment of the spleen, sore throats, bronchitis and liver disease [2] . GA has been reported to inhibit the replication of the SARS-associated coronavirus [3] . LQ possess various biological activities including anti-allergic and anti-tussive activities [4] . Over-collection of wild licorice plants in China resulted in a decline in wild resources and induced desertification of the habitat. Thus, cultivation of licorice was a substitute for the wild resources [5] . The low germination rate and content of active components in cultivated licorice limit its large-scale cultivation [6, 7] .",

Wild licorice mainly grows in arid and semi-arid regions where it contributes to long-term soil maintenance [10] . Over-collection of wild licorice plants is one of the factors inducing desertification in western China. In 2000, the Chinese government imposed restrictions on the collection of wild licorice so as to conserve the natural environment. With the increasing demand for licorice and the decline of wild licorice resources, cultivated licorice roots have attracted attention as an additional source. However, there remain various issues concerning licorice cultivation, such as the low content of secondary metabolites in cultivated licorice roots and the low germination rate of licorice seeds. Space science provides novel, unique research opportunities. Weightlessness, high radiation, high charge and high energy (HZE) particles may cause DNA mutation and hereditary changes in plants [11] .",

In this study, DNA mutation of outer space orbited licorice was verified by ISSR analysis, to assess genetic variation. Secondary metabolite products are the main active components in natural drugs or medicinal plants, but there have been relatively few reports about the effects of space flight on secondary metabolites [16] . In this experiment, HPLC analysis demonstrated that the contents of GA and LQ in the experimental licorice roots were higher than that in the ground control group. It is thus apparent that the biosynthesis of GA and LQ changed after space flight. This means that space flight may affect functional gene expression of secondary metabolism in licorice.",

This research represents the first study of the genetic variation of licorice after orbital space flight utilizing the ISSR technique. The results demonstrate that plants from exterrestrically orbited seeds generated different band types. Because we used the same type of licorice seeds in the space group and in the control one the effects of flights were the main factors on the licorice genetic mutation. Jiang et al. [17] have studied the effects of space flight on rice seeds, which demonstrated the effects of orbital space flight in causing the first generation mutation. The second generation generates the most broad spectrum separation in characteristics, and in the third generation these variations were transmitted to future generations achieving basic stability. This is also the first report of the influence of secondary metabolites after space flight. HPLC data showed that the contents of GA and LQ in roots from outer space orbited seeds are significantly higher than that of control group. This research partially accounts for the molecular mechanism of space mutation in medicinal plants.",
