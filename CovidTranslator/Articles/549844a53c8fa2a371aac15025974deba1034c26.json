The biological objects studied include alanine with amino terminal residue, deoxyadenosine with free residue, Coronaviridae and Bartonella bacilliformis. An expression has been articulated to identify the mass of biological objects from the shift of frequency. Sensitivity of the sensor has been calculated when subjected to such biological objects. Molecular structural mechanics approach has been used for investigating the vibrational responses of zigzag and armchair double-walled carbon nanotube-based nano biosensors. The elastic properties of beam element are calculated by considering mechanical characteristics of covalent bonds between the carbon atoms in the hexagonal lattice. Spring elements are used to describe the interlayer interactions between the inner and outer tubes caused due to the van der Waals forces. The mass of each beam element is assumed as point mass at nodes coinciding with carbon atoms at inner and outer wall of DWCNT. Based on the sensitivity and the frequency shift it can be concluded that cantilever zigzag DWCNTs are better candidates for detecting the biological objects.",

Bartonella, the agent of trench fever and a cause of endocarditis and bacillary angiomatosis in humans, has been highest reported in vitro hemin requirement for any bacterium (Carroll et al. 2000) . Hence, it is very important to safeguard against these viruses by sensing the presence and amount of the same.

Molecular dynamics (MD) is an accurate method capable of simulating the full mechanical DWCNT performance. The free vibrations of CNTs have been investigated by Sohlberg et al. (1998) . Applying the interactions at the atomic scale it is found that atomistic approaches are more reliable than continuum based methods (Li and Chou 2004; Sanchez-Portal et al. 1999; Dereli and Ozdogan 2003) . Blevins used the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to derive corresponding eigenvalues of the CNT vibration (Blevins 1979) . Yoon et al. (2003) studied the resonant frequency and associated vibrational modes of an individual multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) embedded in elastic medium. Xu et al. (2008) researched the free vibrations of DWCNT modeled as elastic beams due to different boundary conditions between inner and outer tubes. Li and Chou (2003) developed an equivalent structural beam to mimic interatomic forces of the covalently bonded carbon atoms. Later, Tserpes and Papanikos (2005) presented the atomistic finite element (FE) model of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) based on the Li and Chou equivalent structural beam concept.",

The sensitivity of the apparently deviated double-walled carbon nanotubes, different masses attached to the end of outer tube tip and center of the outer tube of the bridged DWCNT and different lengths have been explored and presented. The effect of waviness along the axis has been evaluated by subjecting the nanotube to different boundary conditions, namely bridged, cantilever and simply supported and the vibration responses of straight and wavy DWCNTs are investigated by Patel and Joshi (2014) . Jensen et al. (2008) have demonstrated a room temperature, carbon-nanotubebased nano mechanical resonator with atomic mass resolution.

The sensor is to be developed based on DWCNT so as to be able to identify the viruses, bacteria and other biological objects that may be attached to outer wall of the nanotube. In order to perform the vibration analysis of the system information about the mass of various biological object is required which is indicated in Table 1.  Tables 3 and 4 show the percentage error in frequency shift for various values of the attached molecules. The percentage error is calculated by taken the difference between results obtained using the Atomic finite element simulation and analytical approach. Table 5 signifies the resonant frequency and frequency shift of cantilever DWCNT due to Coronaviridae virus. Table 6 shows resonant frequency for cantilever DWCNT using biological mass Bartonella Bacilliformis.",

            "text": "1. Alanine with Amino terminal residue: Alanine is an a -amino acid with the chemical formula CH 3 \u00c1CH (NH 2 ) COOH. It is one of the 22 proteinogenic amino acids, which are considered as the building blocks of proteins. It is also well known as 2-aminopropanoic acid. The a carbon atom of alanine is bound with a methyl group (-CH 3 ), making it one of the simplest a-amino acids with respect to molecular structure and also resulting in alanine's being classified as an aliphatic amino acid. The methyl group of alanine is non-reactive and is thus almost never directly involved in protein function. It occurs in bacterial cell walls and in some peptide antibiotics. Alanine can be manufactured in the body from branched chain amino acids such as valine, leucine and isoleucine and it plays a key role in glucose-alanine cycle between tissues and liver. In muscle and other tissues that degrade amino acids for fuel, amino groups are collected by transamination. 2. Deoxyadeonosine with free residue: Deoxyadenosine refers to a deoxyribonucleoside (a nucleoside compo-nent of DNA, composed of adenosine and deoxyribose) with the chemical formula C 10 H 13 N 5 O 3 . It is derived from the nucleoside adenosine, which differs by the replacement of a hydroxyl group (-OH) by hydrogen (-H) in the ribose part of the molecule. This modification prevents the formation of phosphodiester linkages which are needed for the completion of nucleic acid chains. A deoxyribonucleoside is a type of nucleoside including deoxyribose as a component. 3. Coronaviridae: Coronaviridae is a family of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. The viral genome is 26-32 kb in length. Virions are spherical, 120-160 nm across (Coronavirinae), bacilliform and 170-200 by 75-88 nm (Bafinivirus) or found as a mixture of both, with bacilliform particles characteristically bent into crescents (Torovirus). The particles are typically Fig. 6 Comparison of frequency between Li and Chou (2004) and current model for different length and types of DWCNT decorated with large (*20 nm), club-or petal-shaped surface projections (the ''peplomers'' or ''spikes''), which in electron micrographs of spherical particles create an image reminiscent of the solar corona.",

It is clearly observed that zigzag DWCNTs possess better mass sensitivities as compared to armchair DWCNTs. These sensitivities are calculated using Eq. (46). Figure 8 shows the shifts in the resonant frequency due to the attached masses (08 molecules of alanine with amino terminal) for the cantilever, zigzag and armchair DWCNT. It can be visualized form that a higher frequency shift is observed for zigzag DWCNT (8,8)@(6,6) with the increase in the attached molecules of the biological object. Further a gradual reduction in the frequency shift is observed for other types of DWCNTs. Figure 9a , b shows the shifts in the resonant frequency due to the attached masses (07 molecules of deoxyadeonosine) for the cantilever (zigzag and armchair) and bridged (zigzag and armchair) DWCNT. Similarly, Fig. 10 shows frequency shift due to 07 molecules of deoxyadenosine residue vs. Zigzag and Armchair type of DWCNT. In both the cases a higher frequency shift is observed in cantilever DWCNT (8,8)@(6,6). Figures 11 and 12 show frequency shift due to 07 molecules of Coronaviridae Bartonella Bacilliformis, respectively. The general tread is similar in both the cases with the maximum shift for zigzag (8,8)@(6,6) CNTs, whereas the maximum shift is obtained for (14,0)@(10,0) in case of armchair DWCNT. The reason for it can be attributed to the change in the orientation of the bonds in CNT which further leads to a change in stiffness variation and hence a change in the frequency shift. Also the sensitivity values given in Table 7 clearly suggest that zigzag CNTs are better candidates for sensing the viruses and biological objects as its sensitivity is 0.1424 Zg/GHz.",
