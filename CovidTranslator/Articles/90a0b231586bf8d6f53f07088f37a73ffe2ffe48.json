Of 16 such hospitals, 14 had cases. The overall attack rate was 1.20%. Nonmedical support staff had the highest attack rate (2.73%). The odds ratios of group nonmedical support staff versus those of nurses and of nonmedical support staff versus other technical or medical staff were 2.30 (p < 0.001) and 9.78 (p < 0.001), respectively. The number of affected staff and attack rates were significantly correlated with the number of SARS patients admitted (r = 0.914 and 0.686, respectively). Affected patients were concentrated in three hospitals and in the earlier phase of the epidemic. Cleaning and clerical staff on hospital wards were at a much higher risk.",

All were full-time staff. The Hospital Authority and individual hospitals kept lists of infected workers who were hospital staff members. These lists were provided to the authors, with data already grouped into the three categories and the two time periods; no further breakdown of the data was available. Most data were obtained from the Hospital Authority; supplementary data were obtained from a few hospitals. The number of these three types of workers who became probable SARS patients, according to the World Health Organization definition (1), was recorded. These figures were further stratified into two groups: patients whose onset of symptoms occurred 1) before April 17, or 2) on or after April 17, which was approximately the mid-point of the epidemic. Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to test the significance of differences in proportions. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to examine the association between the number of SARS patients admitted into a hospital and the number of healthcare workers who contracted SARS in the same hospital. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare differences in attack rates among the three types of workers. SPSS for Windows Release 11.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for the data analysis; p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. Differences in attack rates among the 16 hospitals were tested by using Fisher-Freeman-Halton test (StatXact-4 version 4.0.1, Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA).",

Three of the six Hospital Authority staff who died of SARS also belonged to this group. In short, nonmedically trained support staff were exposed to a disproportionately high risk for nosocomial transmission of SARS. Apparently, infection control training was also offered to this group. However, the exact amount of training or assessment of how well the training was understood by this group was not documented. Extra protection is required to protect this staff group in the infection control campaign in Hong Kong. Insufficient emphasis may have been given to address the special needs of this group during the first SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, as well as during the post-SARS period. Infection control training and policies may need to be tailored for different occupational groups.",

Whether they were adequately trained to use their personal protective equipment correctly is not clear. For instance, some preliminary studies mentioned that some workers were wearing or taking off such equipment in the wrong sequence (Lau et al., unpub. data) . In Hong Kong, many support staff were likely to be middle-aged persons, who had a relatively low level of education (many of them did not finish secondary schools). Tailored infection control training and surveillance programs are hence warranted to ensure that this group of workers is sufficiently protected from the occupational hazard of contracting SARS. Practice exercises may also be an effective preventive measure. These findings do not mean that nurses were not under a high level of occupational hazard. More than 50% of the affected workers were nurses. In six hospitals, nurses' attack rates were close to or higher than 1%; the maximum was 4.66%. The correlations between number of SARS patients admitted and the number of affected workers were much stronger in the nonmedical support and nursing groups, when compared with that of other medical staff). This finding is understandable as most members of these two groups were working on the frontlines.",

Nosocomial infection was therefore likely to be responsible for most transmission. Hospital workers in Hong Kong were well supported and appreciated by Hong Kong citizens and the mass media for their professionalism in treating SARS patients. Whether such strong media interest in their experiences and commitment influenced hospital workers in their decision to serve in high-risk environments, at times even when protection might not have been adequate, is of interest. Questions such as how conformity and peer pressure affected the decisions of individual workers who felt that they had to work under suboptimal infection control conditions are worth exploring.",

When cases with earlier onset (before April 17, 2003) were considered, the rates were higher: 0.99, 2.24, and 0.21, respectively. The respective ratios of the two phases of the epidemic were 4.50:1, 4.48:1, and 3.00:1 for the three types of hospital workers and 4.45:1 for hospital workers overall (Table 3 ). This may be due to a reduction in the number of patients admitted after April 17 (approximately 18.3% of all cases; the number of patients admitted in the two phases was hence 3.92:1) or to improvement of infection control measures. The overall attack rate ratio (4.45:1, 0.98%/0.22%) was very similar to the overall admission rate for the two phases (4.46:1), although the two ratios were not conceptually equivalent. It, however, gives a clue that the decrease in exposure may have played a relatively important role in the decreased attack rate in the second phase. Improved infection control in the second phase may not be the primary reason for the decrease in the attack rate over time. If proper training, supply of personal protective equipment, infection control procedures, nonexcessive number of patients per hospital, and other measures are ensured, nosocomial infection of hospital workers should be avoidable. On the other hand, hospital workers, especially nonmedical support staff, should be aware that they are facing a certain level of occupational risk.",

Some hospital workers may have been infected in the community. However, another case-control study showed that social contact with other infected colleagues was not a significant factor associated with likelihood of infection among hospital workers (10) . The chance of nosocomial infection was therefore very high for these staff who contracted SARS. Another study suggested that asymptomatic transmission among hospital workers was not prevalent (5) . Second, different types of workers were included in the three studied job categories, and some heterogeneity across these different types of workers with the categories may exist. The available data do not permit further breakdown. The classification of affected workers into the three categories was arbitrary and may also have affected results. Further, no additional data exist to compare the conditions on infection control and other measures taken within the two analyzed phases of the epidemic, making definite interpretation impossible. The study, however, documents one of the most important scenarios of nosocomial infection among hospital workers. The results should help us to learn from this very costly lesson.",
