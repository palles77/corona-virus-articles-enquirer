Their class specificity was assessed by two radioimmunological methods, nameIy, radioimmunoelectrophoresis and double antibody sandwich radioimmunoassay. The methods are highIy specific and sensitive and do not require the use of purified immunoglobulins, but can be performed with normai serum or colostrum. It was confirmed that antibodies found satisfactory in these tests were suitable for a wide range of use including radioimmunoassay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.",

The curves showing the mean radioactivity of quadruplicate wells incubated with various serum dilutions confirmed high specificity of the antibodies, The gradual decrease of the activities bound in the wells was directly proportional to the degree of dilution and to the initial concentration of immunoglobulin classes in the pig serum, Another measure of the quality of antibodies is the highest ratios of the radloactlvitles bound in wells incubated with various antibody combinations on the first and third incubations. If in both cases antibodies against porcine IgG were employed, i.e. in the combination IgG-SwS-12511gG (thereafter referred to as G-G, etc.), the activity in the wells was as much as 59,9 and 35.6 times as high as in the combinations A-G and H-G, respectively. The highest ratios were obtained at the serum dilution of &:72 900, Analogously, in the combination A-A the activities in the wells were as much as 03,9 and 37,3 times as high as in the combinations G-A and N-A, respectively, The highest ratios were obtained at the serum dilution of l:300, tn the combination N-M the mean activity in the wells was as much as 24.9 and 23.1 times as high as in combinations G-H and A-M, respectively, and the highest ratios were obtained at the serum dilution of l:OO0, DISCUSSION Antibodies combine with the corresponding antigen to produce a complex which is sufficiently stable over a wide range of pH. An important criterion in addition to the avidity and activity of antibodies is their specificity. Antibodies having insufficient specificity react with a number of other similar antigenic structures and their applicability for immunological studies is thus limited. Class-specific anti-immunoglobulin antibodies are required to react only with a certain immunoglobulin class, i.e. with specific antigenic structures of the heavy chains of immuneglobulin molecules. There are a number of methods for checks on class-specific anti-immunoglobulin antibodies. The most widely used are those based on agar-gel precipitation, namely, immunoelectrophoresis, double radial immunodiffusion (Ouchterlony) etc.",
