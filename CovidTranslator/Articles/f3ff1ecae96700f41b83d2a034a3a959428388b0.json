However, concerning the low sensitivity of throat swabs virus RNA detection in previous studies [20, 21, 24] , we speculated that a part of suspected patients or undiagnosed patients might be COVID-19 positive cases. Thus, studies excluding those patients may not actually reflect the real picture of clinical and epidemiological feature of SARS-CoV-2 infected population. Also, accounting for the limited follow-up duration, our data may not reflect the complete course of COVID-19 development. In addition, it is a cross-sectional study with limited ability to infer the causal associations. In the current state of emergency, we hoped that our data-based findings could provide help for disease prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment.",

The rate of severe illness and death were low, whereas some patients had longer incubation period. We, therefore, recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks when necessary. All patients with positive real-time RT-PCR results had significant clinical symptoms and radiological features, which suggests we could use a combination of real-time RT-PCR, chest CT scans and clinical manifestations on admission to increase the diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity of three rounds of real-time RT-PCR together with two rounds of chest CT scans was higher compared with other diagnostic methods. Thus, \"3+2\" strategy should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.",
