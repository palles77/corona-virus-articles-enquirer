Animals were exposed noseonly, inside whole-body chambers, to ADSS from the 1 R4F reference cigarette. End-points included histopathology, CO-oximetry, plasma nicotine and cotinine, clinical pathology, and organ and body weights. The only pathological response observed was slight to mild epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation in the most rostra1 part of the nasal cavity, in the high-exposure group only. No effects were noted at medium or low exposures. The minimal changes noted were reversible, using a subgroup of animals kept without further treatment for an additional 14 days. Overall, the end-points used in the study demonstrated that there was no detectable biological activity of ADSS at typical or even IO-fold ETS concentrations and that the activity was only minimal at very exaggerated concentrations (particle concentrations 100 times higher than typical real-world concentrations).",

(mean ratio 2.1%). This ratio is in very good agreement with ratios for true ETS generated by human smokers in a controlled environment. Ratios of solanesol to particulates from the 1 R4F cigarette in these environments range from 2.6 to 4.0% with a mean ratio of 3.2% (Ogden, unpublished data) . The slightly lower ratios noted in this study can be attributed to the smoke generation and particulate analysis systems used. Sidestream smoke generated only by a smoking machine results in slightly lower solanesol concentrations than does human smoking which includes sidestream smoke and exhaled mainstream smoke (Ogden, unpublished data) . In addition, particulates were determined as WTPM in this study which, by definition, includes water. Significant moisture condensation on the particles will deflate the solanesol/ WTPM ratio and apparently does so at the high exposure used here. Measurement of ETS particulates is not appreciably affected by trapped water due to the high dilution of the smoke aerosol. Likewise, water does not appear to contribute significantly to the WTPM concentrations measured at the low and medium exposures.",

Due to the unusual decay characteristics of nicotine in some situations, 3-ethenylpyridine (a product of nicotine combustion) is gaining acceptance as a tracer for ETS vapor phase (Ogden, 199 1) .",

The low exposure used (target and actual particulate concentrations of 0.10 and 0.09 mg/m3, respectively) is typical of exposure concentrations in public places where smoking is allowed without restriction. For example, average concentrations of tobacco smoke indicators in restaurants are 10.5 pg/m3 nicotine: 2.5 yg/m3 3-ethenylpyridine (Ogden, unpublished data) : and 0.108 mg/m3 particulates and 1.5 pg/m3 solanesol (Oldaker et al., 1990) . These concentrations are equivalent to the concentrations generated in the low exposure (excepting the anomaly noted for the nicotine concentration). As an example of more extreme conditions, the highest concentration of solanesol ever measured in a reallife situation is 12.8 pg/m3 (with an associated particulate concentration of 0.355 mg/m3), recorded in a smoke-filled billiard parlor (Ogden and Maiolo, 1989) .
