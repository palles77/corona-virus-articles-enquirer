            "text": "Diagnostic systems for Lassa fever (LF), a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus (LASV), such as enzyme immunoassays for the detection of LASV antibodies and LASV antigens, were developed using the recombinant nucleoprotein (rNP) of LASV (LASV-rNP). The LASV-rNP was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system. LASV-rNP was used as an antigen in the detection of LASV-antibodies and as an immunogen for the production of monoclonal antibodies. The LASV-rNP was also expressed in HeLa cells by transfection with the expression vector encoding cDNA of the LASV-NP gene. An immunoglobulin G enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using LASV-rNP and an indirect immunofluorescence assay using LASV-rNP-expressing HeLa cells were confirmed to have high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of LASV-antibodies. A novel monoclonal antibody to LASV-rNP, monoclonal antibody 4A5, was established. A sandwich antigen capture (Ag-capture) ELISA using the monoclonal antibody and an anti-LASV-rNP rabbit serum as capture and detection antibodies, respectively, was then developed. Authentic LASV nucleoprotein in serum samples collected from hamsters experimentally infected with LASV was detected by the Ag-capture ELISA. The Ag-capture ELISA specifically detected LASV-rNP but not the rNPs of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or Junin virus. The sensitivity of the Ag-capture ELISA in detecting LASV antigens was comparable to that of reverse transcription-PCR in detecting LASV RNA. These LASV rNP-based diagnostics were confirmed to be useful in the diagnosis of LF even in institutes without a high containment laboratory, since the antigens can be prepared without manipulation of the infectious viruses.",

Many cases of LF occur in western Africa in countries such as Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria (7, 23, 27, (29) (30) (31) . It is thought that LASV infects tens of thousands of humans annually and causes hundreds to thousands of deaths (34) . Humans become infected through contact with infected excreta, tissue, or blood from the peridomestic rodent, Mastomys natalensis, the reservoir host of LASV (34) . LASV can be transmitted to other humans via mucosal or cutaneous contact or through nosocomial contamination (27) . More than 20 imported cases of LF have been reported outside the endemic region in areas such as the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan (1, 2, 13, 15, 18, 24, 25) . Recently, the potential for the use of hemorrhagic fever viruses, including LASV, as a biological weapon has been emphasized (5, 6) . Therefore, the development of diagnostic systems for LF is important even in countries free from LF outbreaks to date.",

            "text": "Manipulation of infectious LASV is necessary for the detection of specific antibodies. However, a high-containment laboratory (biosafety level 4 ) is required for handling infectious LASV and, therefore, the preparation of LASV antigens cannot be implemented in institutes without a BSL-4 facility. Within this framework, it is important to develop sensitive and specific diagnostic systems for LF that eliminate the need for the manipulation of infectious LASV. In the present study, the recombinant nucleoprotein (rNP) of LASV (LASV-rNP) was expressed and evaluated for its ability to detect LASV antibodies. LASV-rNP-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent and indirect immunofluorescence assays (ELISA and IIFA) were developed. Furthermore, novel monoclonal antibodies to LASV-rNP were generated and used in combination with the recombinant antigen to develop an LASV antigen (nucleoprotein) capture ELISA. The present study presents an alternative strategy to develop diagnostic systems without handling infectious LASV. pAcUW2B (28) . Clones containing the insert in the correct orientation were selected, and the plasmid DNA was used for cotransfection in Sf21 cells with a polyhedrin-positive AcMNPV DNA, and the supernatant culture was screened for a polyhedrin-negative phenotype by plaque assay (19) . Finally, recombinant baculovirus clones overexpressing JUNV-rNP were obtained after three successive plaque purifications. One of them, designated AcNMPV-Jun-N122, was used in the present study and is referred to hereafter as Ac-JUNV-NP.",

A preliminary study demonstrated that most of the Tn5 cellular proteins were solubilized in PBS containing 2 M urea (PBS-2 M urea) but that the His-LASV-rNP was insoluble and that the LASV-rNP could be solubilized in PBS containing 8 M urea (PBS-8 M urea). Therefore, the Tn5 cells infected with Ac-His-LASV-NP were first suspended in PBS-2 M urea. After the centrifugation of the cell suspensions at 15,000 \u03eb g for 10 min, the pellet fractions were collected and then were solubilized in PBS-8 M urea. After the centrifugation of the samples, the supernatant fractions were used as the purified antigens. LCMV-rNP and JUNV-rNP showed dissolution characteristics in urea similar to those of His-LASV-rNP; therefore, LCMV-rNP and JUNV-rNP were also fractioned in the same way as the His-LASV-rNP. The control antigen was produced from Tn5 cells infected with Ac-\u232cP in the same manner as that for the positive antigens. The His-LASV-rNP was also purified by using the Ni 2\u03e9 column purification method as reported previously (38) .

The Ag-capture ELISA with MAb 4A5 detected His-LASV-rNP concentrations as low as 800 pg/ml (data not shown). Furthermore, the Ag-capture ELISA detected the MOPV-NP but not the rNPs of LCMV and JUNV (data not shown). All of the sera collected from five LASV-infected hamsters on days 11 and 16 postinfection were antigen positive in the Ag-capture ELISA using MAb 4A5 as a capture antibody, whereas the sera collected on days 0 and 4 were antigen negative. The OD 405 values in the ELISA were highest on day 11. The reactivity patterns in each hamster in the ELISA were similar to the viremia levels (Fig. 5) . The sera collected on days 11 and 16 were found to be LASV genome positive by RT-PCR (10). Thus, the sensitivity of the Ag-capture ELISA was similar to that of the RT-PCR.",

Although the data were not shown, an IgM-capture ELISA using purified LASV-rNP as an antigen was developed in the same way as that shown in previous reports and detected LASV-IgM antibody (42, 43) . All sera collected from LF patients and monkeys infected with LASV showed positive reactions in the LASV-rNP-based IIFA. The staining patterns of the rNP with these sera were granular in the IIFA (Fig. 3) , making it easy to distinguish positives from negatives. IIFA using LASV-rNP-expressing HeLa cells was also highly sensitive and specific in detecting LASV-IgG. In the preliminary study, ca. 15% of the sera collected from 334 Ghanaians and only less than 1% of 280 Zambians showed positive reactions in the LASV-rNP-based IgG ELISA (our data). The results are considered to be compatible with the fact that LF is endemic to the western African region, including Ghana, but not to the eastern African region. The LASV-rNPbased antibody detection systems such as ELISA and IIFA were suggested to be useful not only in the diagnosis of but also in the seroepidemiological study of LF.",

The reactivities of MAb 6C11 and MAb 2-11 were not evaluated with MOPV-NP. However, theoretically, MAb 6C11 should be reactive with MOPV-NP due to the presence of the amino acid residues that can react with MAb 6C11, but MAb 2-11 should not react with MOPV-NP due to the absence of the amino acid residues that can react with MAb 2-11. MAbs to LASV-rNP was also developed. Furthermore, detection of the cross-reactive antibody by LASV-rNP-based IgG-ELISA was examined. The results for cross-reactivity indicate that the LASV-rNP-based IgG-ELISA detects not only antibodies to LASV but also those to LCMV. The Ag-capture ELISA using MAb 4A5 was confirmed to be useful in the detection of authentic LASV antigen in sera serially collected from hamsters infected with LASV. The sensitivity of the MAb 4A5-based Ag-ELISA was similar to that of conventional RT-PCR, the efficiency of which in the diagnosis of LF was previously reported (10) . Therefore, the MAb 4A5based Ag-capture ELISA is regarded as useful in the diagnosis of LF. Unfortunately, the efficacy of the MAb 4A5-based Agcapture ELISA in the diagnosis of LF was not evaluated using serum samples from patients. Thus, further study is still required. The three MAbs, including MAb 4A5, were characterized, and the corresponding amino acid residues within the nucleoproteins of LASV, MOPV, LCMV, and JUNV to the epitopes of MAb 6C11 and MAb 2-11 are summarized in Fig.  6C . It was of interest that LASV, MOPV, LCMV, and JUNV might be identified by analyses of the reactivity patterns of MAbs 4A5, 6C11, and 2-11 to the nucleoproteins of each virus. The nucleoproteins of all LASV strains circulating in the western and central parts of Africa would be detected by the MAb 4A5-based Ag-capture ELISA, since this ELISA was able to detect MOPV-NP that was different from LASV in terms of genetic and evolutional characteristics.",
