Myocarditis has a prevalence of more than 50% in SLE postmortem studies and of around 7% in limited scleroderma (LSc) and 21% in diffuse scleroderma. It also carries a different prognostic signifi cance in these two conditions. 1 The fi rst two presentations were initially indistinguishable from an acute coronary syndrome and particularly the second was treated as ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with thrombolysis. Early coronary angiography excluded this possibility, leading to a diagnosis of myocarditis, likely due to SLE. However, failure of response to treatment led to consideration of an alternative aetiology, which relied on multiple diagnostic modalities, including endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) and cardiac MRI (CMRI) coupled with recognition of a rare clinical sign.",

His medical history included SLE with joint and renal involvement. Renal biopsies in 2006 and 2008 had demonstrated type III/IV and V nephritis respectively. Two months prior to his presentation, he had discontinued his lupus treatment consisting of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisolone. He was a lifelong non-smoker with no family history of ischaemic heart disease. On admission, his vital signs were normal and physical examination demonstrated a third heart sound with no gallop rhythm, and multiple striae on both his thighs, likely secondary to long term steroids. Importantly he was noted to have a linear scar on his fronto-parietal region which appeared indurate and alopecic ( fi gure 1 ) and strongly resembled scleroderma en coupe de sabre. No histological examination was performed on this lesion. His ECGs demonstrated infero-lateral ST segment elevation ( fi gure 2 ) and laboratory tests revealed troponin I above 50, peak creatine kinase above 900, C reactive protein 196, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 81 and deranged liver function test (LFT). Chest x-ray (CXR) was unremarkable and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated moderate concentric LV hypertrophy (LVH), normal LV size, borderline reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF), marked infero-posterior hypokinesia and increased subendocardial echo-density. Left heart catheterisation showed unobstructed coronary arteries. At this stage our conclusion was regional myocarditis secondary to SLE and we therefore reintroduced MMF and prednisolone, with gradual clinical improvement and partial normalisation of laboratory test results.",

Agarwal et al 2 demonstrated a risk of myocardial infarction in SLE women greater than 50 times that of matched healthy women. Different mechanisms play a role in the development of CAD in SLE and include premature atherosclerosis, coronary arteritis, thrombotic events with or without antiphospholipid antibodies, vasospasm or embolisation of valvular material and hypertension. 3 Coronary angiography performed on the patient excluded atherosclerotic CAD. At this stage, history and diagnostic fi ndings suggested the possibility of SLE myocarditis. Cardiac involvement has a prevalence of more than 50% in SLE in postmortem studies but is much less commonly diagnosed clinically and can affect pericardium, endocardium, myocardium, coronary arteries and conduction tissue. 3 4 Pulerwitz and colleagues 5 retrospectively examined 171 patients between 1984 and 1998 who had histological diagnosis of myocarditis on EMB according to Dallas criteria and concluded that the overall prognosis in secondary myocarditis was worse than in primary myocarditis and more importantly, that the former was clearly infl uenced by the underlying condition, with good prognosis for peripartum myocarditis, poor prognosis for HIV myocarditis and a trend towards worse prognosis for myocarditis associated with CTD.",
