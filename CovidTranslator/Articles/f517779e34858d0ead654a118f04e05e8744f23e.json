The presence of the adh 1 gene intron did not significantly change the level of expression of the \u00e7\u00c7 s \u00c4 g gene in plants. The analysis of expression of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBs-antigen) in transformed plants expressing the \u00e7\u00c7 s \u00c4 g under the control of different promoters was made. The level of HBs-antigen in plants carrying the HBsAg gene controlled by ( Aocs ) 3 AmasPmas, the hybrid agrobacterium-derived promoter, was the highest in roots and made up to 0.01% of total amount of soluble protein. The level of HBs-antigen in plants carrying the HBsAg gene controlled by the dual 35S RNA cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was the same in all organs of the plant and made up to 0.06% of the total amount of soluble protein. Hairy root and callus cultures of plants carrying the HBsAg gene and expressing the HBs-antigen were obtained.",

Plants are fully able to synthesize target antigens that can cause an active immune response [1] of the host organism. The viral and bacterial antigens were shown to stimulate the production of immunoglobulines against the corresponding pathogens [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Various transgenic plants are now being produced and tested in research centers worldwide as potential producers of vaccines against infection agents causing various human diseases, including the hepatitis B virus [3, 8, 9] . However, the transgenic plant-derived vaccine preparations are not yet commercially available.",

The plasmid constructions obtained were used for transformation of Escherichia coli strain HB101. The constructions containing the HBsAg gene downstream the promoter were transferred into strain LBA4404 (pAL4404) of A. tumefaciens [14] by means of direct transformation [15] .

The expression level of the HBs-antigen in plants controlled by the dual 35S RNA cauliflower mosaic virus promoter was the same in all organs of the plant, accounting for up to 0.06% of total amount of soluble protein. Therefore, (Aocs) 3 AmasPmas, the hybrid agrobacterial promoter, can be regarded as a tissue-specific element of the HBsAg gene expression, maximum expression being induced in roots. The activity of the agrobacterial mannopine synthase gene can be very different in different tissues and organs of the plant, maximum expression being observed in roots and calli [24, 25] . The expression level of the HBs-antigen in leaves of transgenic plants controlled by the (Aocs) 3 AmasPmas promoter substantially increased after wounding and reached to 0.01% of total amount of soluble protein.
