The growth rate of COVID-19 cases is approximately 1.5 times faster in New York-Newark-Jersey compared to Ponca City, OK (b) In the absence of effective controls, larger cities are expected to have more extensive epidemics than smaller cities, Eq. (1). Higher values of R result in a greater percentage of the population eventually infected, unless this effect is curbed by controls that reduce the social contact rate. The translation of growth rates into reproductive numbers was obtained using an infectious period of 1/\u03b3 = 4.5 days.

Counties with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 are available in the data. We next excluded cities that had less than three unique numbers of COVID-19 cases for the 6 days for which we have data, and then subtracted totals deaths to get an estimate of the total number of active cases. This excluded cities with low case counts, likely due to introductions from outside the MSA, for which accurate estimates of local case growth rate is unlikely. This left 201 cities for further analysis. Finally, in order to compare between cities we normalized each city's time-series so that the March 13th case numbers were 1. We next found the slope of the ln(cases) = ln(a) + r \u00b7 t line for each city's normalized time-series of COVID-19 cases. Finally we plotted the natural logarithm of b and the natural logarithm of city population from 2018 census estimates (16) , and performed an ordinary least squares linear regression to determine slope of the scaling line. Regression residuals were not related to city population and a q-q plot of the residuals indicated that they were well described by a normal distribution.",
