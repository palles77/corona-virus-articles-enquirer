Dominant males in lekking species (Ballard & Robel, 1974) , alpha individuals in primate societies (Alberts, Sapolsky, & Altmann, 1992) , queens in social insect colonies (Aron, Passera, & Keller, 1994) , and superspreaders in disease transmission networks (Meyers, Pourbohloul, Newman, Skowronski, 2005) all share the common feature that they are thought to affect their groups more strongly than standard, more generic individuals. Here, we term these animals 'keystone individuals' or merely 'keystones', which, analogous to Paine's 'keystone species' concept (Paine, 1966 (Paine, , 1995 , are defined as individuals that show an inordinately large influence over their social groups relative to their abundance (Sih, Cote, Evans, Fogarty, & Pruitt, 2012; Sih & Watters, 2005) . The ecological effects of these individuals vary wildly among study systems, and their mere presence can become major drivers of social groups' success (Modlmeier, Keiser, Watters, Sih, & Pruitt, 2014) .",

Instead, the evidence behind the role of keystones is more regularly treated as a series of semi-scientific anecdotes or idiosyncratic field observations (e.g. Pyle, Schramm, Keiper, & Anderson, 1999; Sapolsky & Share, 2004) . This is, in part, because manipulating the presence/abundance of putative keystone individuals is intractable for the majority of study systems. For example, predicting which individuals will act as keystones can prove difficult (e.g. during outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS; Shen et al., 2004) and, in some cases, the addition/ removal of keystone individuals is impossible (e.g. McComb et al., 2011) . Consequently, we maintain a poor understanding of (1) how keystone individuals are maintained within populations, (2) the behavioural and physiological mechanisms by which they exert their influence over their fellow group members and (3) how variation in the traits of the keystone individuals themselves shift the collective behaviour or performance of their associated societies. Exploring these avenues is important for our understanding of animal societies because the data available, although quite limited, suggest that keystones have the potential to become powerful arbiters of collective behaviour and group success (e.g. McComb et al., 2011; Sih & Watters, 2005) .",

Most notably, the single best predictor of intercolony variation is the behavioural tendency (or 'personality') of colonies' boldest individuals. Boldness, in this context, is defined as the latency for an individual to resume activity after an aversive threatening stimulus. Strikingly, this variable alone explains more than 60% of the naturally occurring variation in colonies' collectiveforaging behaviour . This result is intriguing because it implies that the behavioural tendencies of these extremely bold individuals may somehow drive colonies' collective behaviour.

The nest was then plucked off of its substrate in its entirety and placed within a chiffon pillow case. Colonies were transported back to nearby hostels/hotels where they were hand-sorted. The number of colony members and inquilines (i.e. heterospecific arthropods living as social parasites in the nest) were counted and colony members were placed together in a clear 490 ml plastic container for transport to Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.A. In Pittsburgh, we again hard-sorted through colonies, determined the boldness of each individual spider and maintained spiders individually in 2ounce (6 ml) plastic cups.

To these colonies we then added one bolder individual from the same source colony (i.e. a putative keystone), determined randomly using statistical software, that varied in its degree of boldness depending on the colony. Some colonies received only a modestly bold individual, while others received a considerably bolder individual, and still other colonies received an extraordinarily bold individual. Care was taken not to mix spiders from multiple source colonies, and thus, relatedness among experimental colony constituents resembled that of naturally occurring colonies. Colonies of Stegodyphus are very highly inbred (r z 0.70) as a consequence of low dispersal among colonies and serial within-colony inbreeding (Smith, Van Rijn, Henschel, Bilde, & Lubin, 2009 ). The mass of each spider was measured prior to experimental combinations. A total of 36 experimental colonies were created in this way. We then split these colonies among two experimental treatments. In half of these colonies, we tested their collective behavioural response to an unrewarding vibratory stimulus daily for 5 days. In the other half of the colonies, we tested collective-foraging behaviour with an identical vibratory stimulus but, upon attacking the artificial stimulus, we rewarded spiders with a presubdued prey item. We then compared the relationship between the behavioural tendencies of colonies' boldest individuals and colonies' collectiveforaging behaviour: the latency for the first spider to bite the vibratory stimulus and the total number of spiders that were out on the capture web during the time of attack. At the end of our assessment of colonies' collective-foraging behaviour, colonies were taken apart and the boldness of each individual was reassessed. To assess the effect of putative keystone individuals on colony performance, we compared the collective mass gain of the nine generic colony members over the duration of our collectiveforaging assays (total mass after \u00c0 total mass before). For this performance metric we restricted our analysis to colonies that received a rewarding prey stimulus.",

Females were permitted 60 s to acclimate before applying two rapid jets of air to the dorsal anterior cephalothorax from approximately 5 cm away using an infant earcleaning bulb. This stimulus elicits a 'huddle' response from S. dumicola, where the spider will tuck its legs under the body and remain motionless. Anecdotally, this seems to be an innate response expressed by every spider we have tested. We then measured spiders' latency to resume locomotion (i.e. moving at least one body length) following the huddle response over the next 10 min. Individuals with low latencies to resume movement were deemed to be more 'bold' than individuals with longer latencies. Individuals' 'boldness' score were subsequently calculated by subtracting their latency to initiate movement from the total trial duration (i.e. 600 s). This calculation makes the presentation of our analyses and results more intuitive, because it ensures that larger numbers correspond to greater boldness.",

Prior to placing the spiders in each colony, we removed each individual from isolation, weighed it and measured its cephalothorax width using imaging software on a Leica M80 light microscope. In our unrewarding stimulus procedure, keystone individuals could be differentiated from nonkeystones by a single blue acrylic paint dot marked atop their abdomen, whereas other colony members remained unmarked. In our rewarding stimulus procedure, all colony constituents were individually marked using a unique pair of coloured dots atop their cephalothorax, which does not appear to influence individuals' participation in foraging activities . Colonies were established in 490 ml clear plastic containers containing a lattice of poultry wiring to facilitate web construction. Colonies were then given 5 days to build a web before their collective-foraging behaviour was tested.

In particular, spiders within colonies that contained just one extremely bold individual showed greater behavioural variation at the end of our foraging assays. Unfortunately, the extent to which these heightened individual differences are repeatable across time remains untested. Finally, in our rewarding stimulus treatment, colonies in which the boldest individual was extremely bold gained more than three times as much mass and more colony members survived the duration of the experiment.

Comparatively rarely, however, have such studies been designed to consider the possibility that just one group member can change the success of an entire social group (Flack et al., 2005) . For S. dumicola, our results not only suggest that singularly bold individuals can augment colony success (i.e. colony member survivorship, collective mass gained), they also reveal that the influence of these individuals is dramatic. In this study, colonies that contained just one extremely bold individual gained three to four times more mass, on average, compared to colonies in which only one modestly bold spider was added. Spiders within these colonies also enjoyed 40% greater survivorship. In New World social spiders of genus Anelosimus, the efficiency with which a group feeds is the key determinant of collective mass gain. Here, groups that contain a mixture of aggressive and docile individuals are 40% more efficient at prey extraction than are monotypic groups, which leave considerable amounts of food uneaten Pruitt & Riechert, 2009 ). Our results are noteworthy because they may represent the most extreme form of social and/or frequency-dependent selection possible: a situation where the performance of an entire group is intimately linked to the behaviour of just one singularly influential individual. Under these circumstances, the behaviour of just one individual could dictate the success of an entire society, and hence, this individual could become a powerful arbiter of social selection. If this is also the case in situ, then this raises several questions. (1) How are individual differences in boldness determined? (2) Why do the average and extreme boldness scores of constituents differ between colonies, when colonies with bolder individuals seem to receive multiple performance benefits? (3) Do seemingly 'generic' group members adopt strategies to manipulate the boldness of the colony's most extreme individuals, or to avoid detrimental colony compositions (Cote, Fogarty, Brodin, Weinersmith, & Sih, 2011; )?",

Our reasoning here was that whichever individuals perform a task would, by default, determine colonies' collective behaviour for that task. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that bolder individuals were more likely to engage in prey capture both in the laboratory (Fig. 2) and in the field Settepani et al., 2013) . Similar instances of personality-dependent task participation have been observed in other systems as well, frequently involving boldness (Harcourt, Ang, Sweetman, Johnstone, & Manica, 2009; Kurvers et al., 2010; Le Vin, Mable, Taborsky, Heg, & Arnold, 2011) . However, upon finer examination, our results here demonstrate that personalitydependent task participation seems insufficient to explain the influence that extremely bold individuals have on their colony. First, colonies containing just one very bold individual attacked prey with significantly more participants. In our view, this suggests that bold individuals are somehow capable of instigating the involvement of fellow group members, and thus, their influence extends beyond just their personal involvement in prey capture. Superficially, this relationship is akin to the excitatory effect of vibratory signals in honeybees, where 'activator' individuals deploy a vibratory signal that instigates and mobilizes the behaviour of fellow group members Cao, Hyland, Malechuk, Lewis, & Schneider, 2009; . Second, the relationship between collective behaviour and the boldness of colonies' boldest individuals emerged only near the end of our foraging assays, and after the boldest individual had ceased participation. This delay in detectable influence also differentiates our results from normal leaderefollower dynamics, where the influence of leaders on the following behaviour of group members is almost immediately recognizable and more ephemeral (Harcourt, Ang, et al., 2009; Webster & Ward, 2011) .",

In particular, we wonder whether the degree to which simple self-organizational rules versus central control underlie the observed patterns. At present, the prevailing theory from the social insect literature is that collective behaviour is largely organized by the actions of simple, functionally equivalent colony members that adhere to one or a few simple rules (Bonabeau, Theraulaz, Deneubourg, Aron, & Camazine, 1997; Mallon, Pratt, & Franks, 2001; Sumpter, 2006; Sumpter & Pratt, 2003) . And this view is certainly sufficient to explain a diversity of impressive collective behaviours. Yet, based on our results, one wonders whether all group members, even those that are morphologically and physiologically similar, follow the same rules or to the same degree. And, we query, does allowing for consistent individual differences in the rules being followed qualitatively change the outcomes of our models of self-organization? Similar questions are now being put forth within the social insect literature Jandt, Bengston, et al., 2014; Jeanson & Weidenm\u00fcller, 2013) . Alternatively, our system may represent another example where the relative organizational and regulative input of keystone individuals is the central organizing unit for collective behaviours (e.g. similar to queens or keystone workers driving worker foraging in paper wasps; Jandt, Tibbetts, & Toth, 2014; Reeve & Gamboa, 1987) .",

            "text": "One mechanism by which bold individuals may influence the behaviour and performance of their colony is by shifting the behavioural tendencies of fellow group members. As demonstrated in a suite of laboratory and field studies, personality types often play an important organizational role in spider and insect societies, shaping individuals' propensity to perform various tasks, their aptitudes/efficiencies for those tasks and colony success. Thus, at least for arthropod societies, any factors that shape the behavioural tendencies of colony constituents could also have implications for colonies' organization and success. Parallel arguments have been made for the distribution of worker size classes in social insects (Billick & Carter, 2007; Porter & Tschinkel, 1985) . In the present study, colonies that contained one very bold individual tended to show greater interindividual variation in boldness at the end of our foraging assays, regardless of whether the prey stimulus was rewarding or unrewarding. This is in contrast to groups that contained only a moderately bold individual, which showed a more compressed distribution of personality types at the end of our colony foraging assays. And importantly, consistent individual differences in behaviour have been linked to task differentiation in three species of social spider, including S. dumicola (Pruitt & Riechert, 2011a; Pruitt & Riechert, 2011b; Grinsted et al., 2013) . Although these results are not absolute, they could provide some clues to how extremely bold individuals exact their influence over colonies' collective behaviour. Specifically, we propose that extremely bold individuals play a sort of catalytic role in the development and persistence of varied personality types within their groups. This, in turn, could influence how task participation is organized among colony constituents. After all, virtually by definition, within-colony behavioural variation is the necessary precondition for division of labour and higher social organization (Beshers & Fewell, 2001) . Admittedly, at present we cannot confirm whether the observed shifts in intracolony behavioural variation actually reflect consistent individual differences in behaviour (i.e. if the shifts are long-lasting); however, numerous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that individuals' boldness measures are highly repeatable under a diversity of social circumstances Pruitt et al., 2013) .",

If bold individuals are behaviourally dominant, as they often are, then their participation in foraging may have initially restricted shyer subordinate individuals' access to food early in the trials. However, our results are contrary to this view, since the relationship between the boldness of colonies' boldest individuals and collective aggressiveness in later trials was identical in colonies that received a rewarding or an unrewarding prey stimulus (Fig. 1, Tables 1e4) . Moreover, individual differences in boldness are not associated with body condition or recent feeding history in S. dumicola Keiser, Modlmeier, Singh, Jones, & Pruitt, in press ). Consequently, however intuitive, differential food restriction of shy individuals and satiation of bold individuals does not appear to be a viable explanation for the results herein. Further studies that inspect both task allocation and division of labour in the presence versus absence of catalytic keystone individuals will help to clarify alternative views.",

            "text": "The idea that singularly influential individuals are capable of shifting group dynamics has been posed for a diverse set of social systems, ranging from social insects to cetaceans. By finely manipulating the phenotypic composition of laboratory colonies of the spider S. dumicola, we provide here some of the first experimental evidence that the presence of just one very bold individual is sufficient to change colonies' collective behaviour and performance. These findings are notable because experimental data sets on the effects of keystone individuals are rare. Moreover, among the limited number of data sets available, it is not clear how variation in the behaviour of the keystones themselves influences either the magnitude or the nature of the effects that they exert over their groups. In contrast, in this study, we were able to associate variation in the behavioural tendencies of putative keystones with the effects that they have on colony attributes, at least in the laboratory. In S. dumicola, the presence of very bold individuals was associated with an increase in behavioural variation in their fellow group members and an increase in colonies' collective aggressiveness during staged foraging bouts. Finally, when groups were permitted to feed collectively on prey items, groups that contained extremely bold individuals gained more mass than other colonies and enjoyed higher individual survivorship. Although the effects of very bold individuals on colony dynamics in the field are yet unknown, our results suggest that individuals showing rare, extreme phenotypes could be powerful arbiters of social selection and group success in both this and other systems.
