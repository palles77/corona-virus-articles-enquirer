Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (iii) increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and/or (iv) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift. Moreover, the formulated model can be used for other similar scenarios, such as identifying infection risk in public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass gatherings.",

The protection level against SARS-COV-2 transmission must be increased accordingly if shortening of work shift duration is not feasible. \u2022 Increased spacing, frequent cleaning of work spaces, and compartmentalizing the rooms of patients in open space decrease the risk of infection not only for health care workers but for the other patients who are COVID-19 negative or non-person-under-investigation (PUI) [10].\u2022 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) plays a vital role in decreasing the risk of infection, but this protective factor can be overwhelmed by the sheer number of COVID-19 patients (whether confirmed or not). Hence, this should not be relied upon alone, and other structural factors, such as crowd density, be adjusted. \u2022 Frontliners who are handling risky procedures such as endotracheal intubation (i.e., anesthesiologists) on critically-ill COVID-19 patients (who are most likely to be the most infectious), must be given extra protection, and hospital policies must minimize their duration of exposure and the number of patients they encounter or interact with per shift. \u2022 Health care workers play a very important role in a community's battle against the medical effects of COVID-19. Decreasing the infection risks faced by each health care worker per day, coupled with superior health, well-being and welfare practices, will result in a robust health care staff that can endure a long period of battle during this COVID-19 pandemic. \u2022 Decreasing the infection risk discussed in this paper can also be extended to decreasing the infection risk of non-COVID-19 patients present in a hospital. Moreover, the model and results presented here can be customized for other similar scenarios, such as identifying infection risk in public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass gatherings. \u2022 The recommendations in this paper is based on a theoretical model with parameters calibrated for COVID-19. The theoretical model and algorithm in this paper can be modified for other diseases. It is suggested to validate the results through experiments or cohort and case control studies.
