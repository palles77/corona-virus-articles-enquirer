            "text": "A novel influenza virus, A(H1N1)pdm09 emerged in April 2009 and spread rapidly, primarily through human-tohuman transmission. Several million people were infected globally. 1 An important feature of this virus was that it mostly affected younger people with 60% of patients under 18 years of age, suggesting possible pre-existing immunity in the elderly due to previous exposure to antigenically related influenza strains. 2, 3 The assumption made in most pandemic plans before 2009 was that the pandemic virus would be the dominant circulating respiratory virus. 4 Few studies performed extensive respiratory testing beyond influenza during the pandemic, and fewer still focused on community cases. Casalegno et al. documented cocirculation and co-infection of A(H1N1)pdm09 with rhinovirus during the pandemic. 5 Watanabe et al. found a wide range of etiologic agents were identified among respiratory samples that were influenza negative, highlighting the need to diagnose other viral organisms that can co-circulate with influenza. 6 Louie et al. investigated samples from laboratory-confirmed fatal A(H1N1)pdm09 cases during the pandemic and bacterial pathogens were identified in 22 of 77 samples. 7 Prior to the 2009 pandemic, respiratory viral co-infection was reported in 7-27% of respiratory samples submitted for viral diagnosis. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Higher proportions of influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, and rhinovirus, compared with other circulating viruses have been detected in patients with co-infections. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Co-infection has not been fully explored due to limitations of several studies. Some studies focused on younger age groups, hospitalized patients or deceased individuals, which does not represent the general population. [8] [9] [10] 12, 15, 19, 20 Others have utilized a small sample size or limited their focus to certain viral pathogens, underestimating the role of other viruses in co-infection. 9, 15, 16, 20, 21 This study enrolled community patients presenting with (ILI) to a community sentinel network, during the influenza pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 in Ontario, Canada and documented the profile of respiratory viruses causing ILI symptoms. This study aimed to describe respiratory viruses including co-infections and host-associated attributes such as age, sex, and comorbidity.",

It was anticipated that each sentinel would submit an average of 1-2 samples per week from their clinical practice during the study period, April 21, 2009 to February 25, 2010 . This period was chosen to span the full pandemic in Ontario. Eligible patients were Ontario residents, who presented to a sentinel's office with influenza-like illness (ILI) within seven days of symptom onset; number and selection of eligible patients was at the sentinel's discretion. ILI was defined as acute onset of fever and cough and one or more of the following: sore throat, myalgia, arthralgia, headache or prostration. Standard information was collected including date of birth, sex, chronic conditions, symptom onset, and sample collection date. The main outcome was the number of respiratory viruses detected per sample. Samples were categorized as negative, single infection or co-infection when no virus, one virus, or at least two viruses were detected, respectively. Age was determined as age at symptom onset and categorized as 0-4, 5-14, 15-29, 30-54, 55-64, and 65+years. Time to sample collection was calculated as the difference between sample collection and symptom onset dates and categorized as less than or equal to twodays or 3-7 days. Chronic condition was defined as heart \u2044 lung \u2044 renal \u2044 metabolic \u2044 blood \u2044 immune conditions or conditions that compromise the management of respiratory secretions and increase risk of aspiration and categorized as yes \u2044 no.

Despite the higher prevalence of enterovirus \u2044 rhinovirus (23AE4%) than RSV (14AE5%), co-infection with A(H1N1) pdm09/RSV was more common than A(H1N1)pdm09 \u2044 enterovirus \u2044 rhinovirus, accounting for 64AE1% and 22AE8% of the co-infections, respectively. This may reflect the younger age of patients infected by A(H1N1)pdm09, who were therefore also at greater risk of RSV. In addition, RSV cocirculated with A(H1N1)pdm09 more than enterovirus \u2044 rhinovirus, which peaked before the second wave (Figure 2 ). There may also be preferential interactions among certain pathogens; viral interactions were not assessed in this study. 23 When other respiratory samples positive for enterovirus \u2044 rhinovirus were further evaluated at our laboratory, they all were confirmed as rhinovirus, not enterovirus. 24 Single infection was more commonly detected in those less than 65 years of age. It is known that respiratory infections are more common in children for several reasons, including an immature immune system, lack of preexisting immunity particularly to new emerging viruses, and greater viral exposure opportunities. 11, 18, 25 Younger patients shed higher levels of virus when infected and also may be brought for medical care earlier than older patients, facilitating detection in these groups. 26 In addition, lower detection of single and co-infection in elderly may be explained by pre-existing immunity to A(H1N1)pdm09 and other respiratory viruses. 2 Co-infection was more common in persons less than 30 years of age as compared to older adults. These data are congruent with findings from a previously published study where co-infection was more likely in younger than older adults. 18 The combined effect of predominance of A(H1N1)pdm09 and the greater likelihood of infection with other respiratory viruses among younger ages likely explains our age-related findings of co-infection during the pandemic, which may not be generalizable to a typical influenza season.",

            "text": "The presence of comorbidities did not increase the likelihood of having a single infection but increased the likelihood of co-infections; this did not achieve statistical significance. Patients with chronic conditions are at higher risk of severe disease and consequently may be more likely to seek medical care. 26 Selection bias is unlikely to influence these results as the proportion of patients with comorbidities was similar (21AE5%) to that in Ontario's population (20AE3%). 27 Sample collection within 2 days of symptom onset was found to independently increase the likelihood of detecting a viral co-infection but not single infection. Long et al. reported an inverse relationship between duration of symptoms and viral detection rate due to greater viral shedding earlier in the disease process. 11 This study was designed to examine circulating viruses and co-infection. The presence of more than two viruses in the same sample may not always indicate clinical infection. As viruses may be detected in asymptomatic patients, it is impossible to determine which viruses caused symptoms. Previous studies suggest co-infection may manifest higher disease severity, which may shorten the time to medical care and viral detection; disease severity was not assessed in the current study. 19, 28 As viral-bacterial co-infections also occurred during the pandemic, it will be interesting for further studies to investigate their characteristics and impact on disease severity. 28, 29 In summary, A(H1N1)pdm09 was frequently detected among community patients with ILI. However, other respiratory viruses cocirculated with A(H1N1)pdm09 during the pandemic, reinforcing the need to test for other viral agents even during a pandemic to appropriately guide clinical treatment decisions. Viral diagnosis, primarily A(H1N1)pdm09, was made more often in patients less than 65 years of age. Viral co-infection was commonly detected in this study and was most likely detected in individuals less than 30 years of age. Earlier sample collection improves the detection of viral co-infections. Understanding the contribution of other circulating respiratory pathogens during a pandemic may lead to improved individual diagnosis and recommendations for community-based clinicians, and more effective prevention and treatment of respiratory infections, including use of influenza antivirals.",
