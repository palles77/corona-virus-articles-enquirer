We propose a model that stratifies the population by ages, and account for the different incidences of the disease at each strata. The model is used to predict the incidence of the epidemics in a spatial population through time, permitting investigation of control measures. The model is applied to the current epidemic in Spain, using the estimates of the epidemiological parameters and the mobility and demographic census data of the national institute of statistics (INE). The results indicate that the peak of incidence will happen in the first half of April 2020 in absence of mobility restrictions. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and can be adapted to precise mobility restrictions at the level of municipalities. The current estimates largely compromises the Spanish health capacity system, in particular that for intensive care units, from the end of March. However, the model allows for the scrutiny of containment measures that can be used for health authorities to forecast with accuracy their impact in prevalence of COVID-19. Here we show by testing different epidemic containment scenarios that we urge to enforce total lockdown to avoid a massive collapse of the Spanish national health system.",

Epidemiological analysis of the outbreak have been used to estimate epidemiologically relevant parameters [1-10], and available mathematical models have been used to track and anticipate the spread of the epidemics [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Nevertheless, the particularities of the current epidemics calls for a rethinking of conventional models towards tailored ones. Here, we propose mathematical model particularly designed to capture the main ingredients characterising the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and the clinical characteristics reported for the cases of COVID-19. To this aim, we rely on previous metapopulation models by the authors [18] [19] [20] [21] including the spatial demographical distribution and recurrent mobility patterns, and develop a more refined epidemic model that incorporates the stratification of population by age in order to consider the different epidemiological and clinical features associated to each group age that have been reported so far. The mathematical formulation of these models rely on the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach formulation for epidemic spreading in complex networks [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

We also consider the fraction of individuals which require hospitalization to ICU, since their saturation constitutes one of the major political and health problems of COVID-19 outbreak. The result is a model with seven epidemiological compartments for each of the patches composing the metapopulation. Additionally, we split the former epidemiological partition into three age groups: young, adults, and elderly people. This partition allows us to capture in a stylised way the main epidemiological, clinical and behavioural differences between the groups. On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 importation and exportation events",

In this regard, infections in the young group lead to mild symptoms [30] that, without test, are often confused with those of a common cold, whereas for old individuals the infection evolves towards more severe symptoms and usually requires hospitalization. The model incorporates the possibility of designing and evaluating the impact of contention policies to stop the propagation of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we focus on those policies relying on global or targeted quarantine measures. They allow the selection of the optimum degree of mobility to avoid the health system crisis. Taking advantage of this possibility, we explore several epidemic scenarios characterized by different contention measures promoted on March 20, and evaluate their impact on the decrease of the epidemic prevalence and the saturation of the Spanish health system.",

We use a previous framework for the study of epidemics in structured metapopulations, with heterogeneous agents, subjected to recurrent mobility patterns [18] [19] [20] 31] .To understand the geographical diffusion of the disease, as a result of human-human interactions in small geographical patches, one has to combine the contagion process with the long-range disease propagation due to human mobility across different spatial scales. For the case of epidemic modeling, the metapopulation scenario is as follows. A population is distributed in a set of patches, being the size (number of individuals) of each patch in principle different. The individuals within each patch are well-mixed, i.e., pathogens can be transmitted from an infected host to any of the healthy agents placed in the same patch with the same probability. The second aspect of our metapopulation model concerns the mobility of agents. Each host is allowed to change its current location and occupy another patch, thus fostering the spread of pathogens at the system level. Mobility of agents between different patches is usually represented in terms of a network where nodes are locations while a link between two patches represents the possibility of moving between them.",

This differentiation is very relevant in light of the observation of a scarcely set of infected individuals at ages (< 25), and also because of the severe situations reported for people at older ages (> 65). Our model is composed of the following epidemiological compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), asymptomatic infectious (A), infected (I), hospitalized to ICU (H), dead (D), and recovered (R). Additionally, we divide the individuals in N G age strata, and suppose the geographical area is divided in N regions or patches. Although we present the model in general form, its application to COVID-19 only makes use of the three age groups mentioned above (N G = 3): young people (Y), with age up to 25; adults (M), with age between 26 and 65; and elderly people (O), with age larger than 65.

Regarding epidemiological parameters, the incubation period has been reported to be \u03b7 \u22121 + \u03b1 \u22121 = 5.2 days [2] in average which, in our formalism, must be distributed into the exposed and asymptomatic compartments. In principle, if one does not expect asymptomatic transmissions, most of this time should be spent inside the exposed compartment, thus being the asymptomatic infectious compartment totally irrelevant for disease spreading. However, along the line of several recent works [34] [35] [36] we have found that the unfolding of COVID-19 cannot be explained without accounting for infections from individuals not developing any symptoms previously. In particular, our best fit to reproduce the evolution of the real cases reported so far in Spain yields \u03b1 \u22121 = 2.86 days as asymptomatic infectious period. In turn, the infection period is established as \u00b5 \u22121 = 3.2 days [1, 12], except for the young strata, for which we have reduced it to 1 day, assigning the remaining 2.2 days as asymptomatic; this is due to the reported mild symptoms in young individuals, which may become inadvertent [30] . We fix the fatality rate \u03c9 = 42% of ICU patients by studying historical records of dead individuals as a function of those requiring intensive care. In turn, we estimate the period from ICU admission to death as \u03c8 \u22121 = 7 days [37] and the stay in ICU for those overcoming the disease as \u03c7 \u22121 = 10 days [38] .",

Overall, the total number of infectious seeds is 47 individuals which represents 0.2 % of the number of cases reported by March 20, 2020. Figure 2 shows that our model is able to accurately predict not only the overall evolution of the total number of cases at the national scale but also their spatial distribution across the different autonomous regions. Moreover, the most typical trend observed so far is an exponential growth of the number of cases, thus clearly suggesting that the disease is spreading freely in most of the territories.

Figure 3 shows the temporal evolution of the individuals requiring intensive care units while applying the isolation policy by March 20, 2020. Interestingly, it becomes clear that there are two different regimes. For small \u03ba 0 values, the observed behavior corresponds to the flattening of the epidemic curve while promoting social distancing. This way, increasing \u03ba 0 leads to longer epidemic periods with much less impact within society in terms of hospitalized agents. In contrast, for large enough \u03ba 0 values, the effective isolation of households allows for reducing at the same time the epidemic size and the duration of the epidemic wave. This is mainly caused by the depletion [41] of susceptible individuals which prevents the infectious individuals from sustaining the outbreak by infecting healthy peers.",
