For the purpose of this study, we considered the period from April 20 to August 31, 2009, as wave I and the period from September 1 to November 30, 2009, as wave II, although wave II activity continued until January 2010. 4 ",

However, this study provides a larger sample size and is unique in that both institutional (predominantly elderly) and community outbreak (predominantly children) settings are described. We also found an increased likelihood of detecting viruses causing outbreaks as the number of specimens tested increased. Viruses causing coinfections may be co-transmitted between patients as part of the same outbreak, rather than circulating independently of each other. Additional bacterial analysis would be required to conclude that HRV is the sole etiology of individual outbreaks. In contrast, the pandemic virus was detected in almost all CSD outbreaks, which mostly involved children and younger adults as recently highlighted in the literature. 10, 11 Possible reasons for a lower prevalence of A(H1N1)pdm09 in LTCFs outbreaks include cross-protective antibodies from previous exposure to influenza A (H1N1) strains among elderly or minimal exposure to individuals more likely to be infected by the pandemic strain, such as children. 10, 11 From June 11 to November 30, 2009, we found that ENT \u2044 HRV was frequently identified in LTCF outbreaks involving elderly residents, whereas in outbreak settings involving children and younger adults, A(H1N1)pdm09 was primarily detected. Younger children were not well represented in the CSD group, which had a median age of 13AE4 years. This likely reflects the age distribution of children that attend sleep away summer camps in Ontario.",

A distinction between upper and lower respiratory tract infections, the role of asymptomatic shedding, and comparison of severity of outbreaks could not be performed as clinical data were missing. In Ontario, the local medical officer of health or designate determines whether an institutional outbreak meets the provincial case definition. PHO laboratories do not receive sufficient outbreak information to make this determination. In this context, this study highlights the importance of submitting more than one sample to properly investigate an outbreak. Other bacterial agents like Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydophila pneumonia could not be ruled out as the cause of outbreaks as samples were not routinely tested for them. A distinction could not be made between staff and resident cases in this study as staff information was not systematically reported. This highlights a current deficiency in the investigation and reporting of staff illness in LTCFs. 9 An increased rate of ENT \u2044 HRV outbreaks may have been observed during the pandemic because of increased vigilance by individuals to report symptoms to their healthcare providers, who in turn had a lower threshold to report outbreaks to the public health units who coordinate laboratory investigations. Therefore, we might have seen increased specimen collection and testing that may have influenced our findings.",
