            "text": "Background: Since the discovery of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, diagnostic protocols were quickly published and deployed globally. Objectives: We set out to assess the quality of MERS-CoV molecular diagnostics worldwide. Study design: Both sensitivity and specificity were assessed using 12 samples containing different viral loads of MERS-CoV or common coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1). Results: The panel was sent to more than 106 participants, of which 99 laboratories from 6 continents returned 189 panel results.Scores ranged from 100% (84 laboratories) to 33% (1 laboratory). 15% of respondents reported quantitative results, 61% semi-quantitative (Ct-values or time to positivity) and 24% reported qualitative results. The major specific technique used was real-time RT-PCR using the WHO recommended targets upE, ORF1a and ORF1b. The evaluation confirmed that RT-PCRs targeting the ORF1b are less sensitive, and therefore not advised for primary diagnostics. Conclusions: The first external quality assessment MERS-CoV panel gives a good insight in molecular diagnostic techniques and their performances for sensitive and specific detection of MERS-CoV RNA globally. Overall, all laboratories were capable of detecting MERS-CoV with some differences in sensitivity. The observation that 8% of laboratories reported false MERS-CoV positive single assay results shows room for improvement, and the importance of using confirmatory targets.",

            "text": "A novel beta-coronavirus, named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified as the cause of severe respiratory disease in humans in the Middle East in 2012 [1, 2] . Within weeks after the initial reports, protocols were published for diagnosing this agent by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [3, 4] . In the first report [3] , real-time RT-PCR assays were described for two targets, one located upstream of the envelope gene (UpE) and one within open reading frame 1b (ORF1b). The second report [4] included a diagnostic screening algorithm describing an assay targeting the ORF1a gene, which was more sensitive than the ORF1b assay and therefore recommended as confirmatory assay rather than ORF1b RT-PCR. In the meantime, other laboratories had developed their own assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene, showing similar sensitivity to the upE RT-PCR [5, 6] . The World Health Organization (WHO) recently published updated interim recommendations for laboratory testing of MERS-CoV [7] , in which the upE RT-PCR is recommended as firstline screening assay. According to this recommendation, positive MERS-CoV RT-PCR should subsequently be confirmed with either ORF1a, ORF1b, or N gene RT-PCR's. An alternative for the confirmatory RT-PCR is sequencing of the N gene or RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene (ORF1), as described before [3] . Presently, laboratories around the world have implemented in-house or commercial methods for MERS-CoV molecular diagnostics [8] , mostly based on the above described publications [9] , but with substantial diversity in nucleic acid extraction methods, RT-PCR (master) mixes and thermocyclers used. External quality assessment (EQA) studies give insight in the possible effects of this variation on assay performance, thereby allowing the participating laboratories to assess the quality of current diagnosis, and identify possible weaknesses and strengths of the range of diagnostic methods that are used.",

All viruses were grown in Vero E6 cells, of which cell culture supernatant was harvested, inactivated by heating (1 h at 60 \u2022 C) and gamma irradiated (25 kilo gray). The proficiency test panel included seven samples containing serial 10-fold dilution of MERS-CoV positive cell culture supernatant (1:10-1:10 7 ), four samples with common human coronavirus (NL63, OC43, 229E, HKU1) positive culture supernatants, and two negative control sera as specificity controls. The samples were freeze-dried in 2\u00d7 Lyophilization reagent (Ops diagnostics, NJ, USA) using an EPSILON 2-6D Pilot Freeze Dryer (Martin Christ GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany) in 0.5 ml glass vials. The human coronavirus HKU1 was propagated as previously described [10, 11] . No infectious virus was detected when tested for residual infectivity after heat and gamma irradiation by inoculation in cell culture. The participants were assured that they were provided with nonbiohazardous material, but recommending to handle all material with care as is recommended for human specimens in general.",

Table 2 shows the percentage of correct results per MERS-CoV positive sample of the total EQA panel (n = 7), and the results per assay type, including median (range) per sample for quantitative and semi-quantitative results. Quantitative results showed quite a big variance in the viral load (VL), with the lowest variance for sample #5 ( maxVL\u2212minVL = 3.45 10 log genome equivalents (geq./ml)) and highest for sample #6 ( maxVL\u2212minVL = 4.78 10 log geq./ml), without sample #8 taken into account. These differences were observed despite the fact that most laboratories indicated the use of a quantified in vitro transcribed RNA, provided by the European Virus Archive (EVA) as quantifying standard. To study if this variance is due to the quantification transformation (Ct values into geq./ml) or to the variance of the reported real-time RT-PCR results (Ct values), the viral load variance of the quantitative results described above were recalculated from geq./ml to Ct-values (with arbitrary 100% efficiency, 1 log\u223c3.3Ct), equalling 11-16 Ct. This variation is comparable to the semi-quantitative data of the EQA panel (15.2-21.5 Ct for samples #13 and #6 or #9, respectively) and the wide range in reported loads can therefore not be attributed to the quantification transformation.",

HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 are beta-coronaviruses similar to MERS-CoV. Two laboratories reported MERS-CoV RNA detected in one of the negative controls (2%). Additionally, 6.1% of the laboratories reported detection of MERS-CoV RNA in the samples spiked with the non-MERS HCoV, of which three in the HCoV-NL63 sample and one laboratory in the HCoV-229E sample alone. However, one laboratory reported MERS-CoV RNA detected in both HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 samples, and one laboratory in the samples containing HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1. The false positive results were not associated with a specific assay, as other laboratories using the same protocols did not report this reactivity. This may suggest that these aspecific results originated from contamination rather than non-specific reactions with non-MERS HCoVs or from a different interpretation algorithm of the raw data. Nevertheless, in total 8.1% of the laboratories reported false-positive results. . Some of these laboratories missed one or more common HCoVs, being 23.5% HCoV-HKU1, 2.9% HCoV-OC43, 12.1% HCoV-229E, and 12.1% for HCoV-NL63.

A quarter of the laboratories (26.2%) reported quantitative results, though the variance in reported viral concentration was high. This may be due to the fact that there is no international NAT standard (IS) available. Using inactivated complete virus control (provided by the RKI) is recommended, since this takes the variations of the nucleic acid extraction as well as RT-PCR variations into account. However, using a quantified RNA control, provided by European Viral Archive (EVA) merely quantifies the amount of RNA added to the RT-PCR, but does not take variations induced by nucleic acid extractions into account. Though, differences in performance of RT-PCR mixes can be measured using RNA controls. It is known that the variation in viral loads quantified by in-house standards is much higher than if laboratories world-wide use one NAT IS, which can be handled in the exact way as clinical sample (QCMD CMV panels, unpublished results).",

The recommendation of WHO to use confirmatory RT-PCR on a second MERS-CoV genomic target was followed by a majority of the laboratories, though multiple laboratories indicated to have sequencing available for confirmation. Currently there are a number of MERS-CoV specific commercial real-time RT-PCR assays marketed, having the advantage of included (internal and positive) controls in a single kit whose quality is regulated by authorities.

MERS-CoV has not been detected in upper respiratory tract samples (nose swabs) in some infected humans, suggesting the potential for missed cases if only such specimens are collected [12, 13] . In lower respiratory tract samples (trachea aspirates, broncho-alveolar lavages) MERS-CoV concentrations were found to be significantly higher than in upper or middle respiratory tract samples [14, 15] , though these samples may not be easy to take from patients with respiratory distress. Taken the fact that most diagnostic samples sent for MERS-CoV molecular diagnostics are throat swabs containing low MERS-CoV RNA concentrations, and that 84.6% of the reported results were correct for sample 10, having the lowest concentration in the panel (median viral load 3.83E3 geq/ml), this may reflect underdiagnosis of MERS-CoV infections due to sensitivity problems in the diagnostic method used by a small portion of the laboratories.",
