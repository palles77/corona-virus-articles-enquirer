Bacterial metabolism of methylene chloride by an oxidative pathway was the primary cause of the positive result; methylene chloride is metabolized to an intermediate which is so unstable that in the Ames' test this intermediate is effective only when produced in the bacterial cell. The mutagenic potential of methylene chloride has also been studied in Drosophila by the recessive lethal test (Abrahamson and Valencia, 1978; Filippova, 1967) with no demonstrable mutagenic potential.",

Most tumors had remnants of normal salivary acini or ducts within the area of cellular proliferation. Most tumors had some areas that morphologically resembled one cell type (i.e., fibrosarcoma), while other areas resembled another cell type (i.e., neurofibrosarcoma), and still other tumors had cell types that were undifferentiated or pleomorphic. In some, one cell type was predominant, while in others, areas of all of the above cell types were present depending on the area of the tumor examined.

This was evident in most of the exposure-related gross and histopathologic lesions, and usually with a dose-response relationship. Furthermore, control hamsters with severe amyloidosis often had many secondary lesions including atrophy of the genitalia, loss of body fat, and liver failure (including ascites, hydrothorax, pulmonary edema, and subcutaneous edema).

Despite the increased number of benign mammary tumors, there was no indication of an increased number or incidence of malignant mammary tumors in either male or female rats exposed to methylene chloride. The significance of this benign mammary tumor response is unknown. However, the Sprague-Dawley rats used in this study normally have a high incidence of mammary tumors. The incidence varies from study to study but normally exceeds 80% in females and about 10% in males in our laboratory. Therefore, the predisposition of this strain to these mammary tumors plus the high methylene chloride exposure concentrations may have resulted in an increased benign mammary tumor response. Male rats exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm had an increased number of sarcomas in the ventral midcervical area in the region of the salivary glands with 1, 0, 5, and 11 sarcomas in the 124 male rats per group exposed to 0, 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm, respectively. Based on routine sections, special stains, and ultrastructural evaluation, these tumors appeared to be of mesenchymal cell origin; although a myoepithelial cell origin of these cells could not be ruled out. All appeared to be arising in the midcervical region and all involved the salivary glands. Only 2 tumors were small enough to be localized within the salivary gland. The rest were larger tumors that clearly involved the salivary glands as well as adjacent tissues and could have been growing either into or out of the salivary glands. However, all probably arose within the salivary glands based on the two small tumors noted above and their similarity to tumors of this type which have been documented as arising in the salivary glands of rats (Glucksmann and Cherry, 1973) and mice (Dawe, 1979) .",

However, the increased incidence of sarcomas was specific to male rats with no increase in tumors of this type detected in female rats or in hamsters of either sex. Therefore the high degree of sex and species specificity for this response is inconsistent with the rest of our knowledge about the biology of this material.",

For example, male and female hamsters had decreased amyloid in methylene chloride exposed animals compared to controls. The decrease was most prominent in females and appeared to have resulted in increased survivability of tbe females exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm. Another example was in male rats exposed to 1500 or 3500 ppm and females exposed to 3500 ppm which had less age-associated chronic progressive kidney disease than their respective controls. Other examples of possible exposure-related decreases in a naturally occurring lesion included decreased biliary cysts in methylene chloride exposed male and female hamsters, and decreased pancreatic lesions in methylene chloride exposed male rats, and decreased pituitary tumors in methylene chloride exposed female rats. The toxicological significance of these exposure-related decreases is unclear. Female hamsters exposed to 3500 ppm had a statistically significant increase in the total number of females with a benign tumor. However, the females exposed to 3500 ppm had statistically significantly better survival than did the controls. In addition, the incidence and severity of amyloid was decreased in females exposed to 3500 ppm. The increased survival alone could explain this slight increase in benign tumors. However, the decreased amyloid in various tissues also made it easier to recognize small benign tissue proliferations, especially in endocrine organs such as adrenal glands. Therefore, the increased number of female hamsters with a benign tumor in the 3500-ppm exposure group was not considered to be the direct result of the methylene chloride.",

In the rat, the metabolism of methylene chloride to carbon monoxide exhibits dose dependency at exposure concentrations greater than about 250 ppm. Above 500 ppm there is little change in carboxyhemoglobin levels with increasing methylene chloride exposures (McKenna et al., 1979) . As a result, no exposure-related increases would be expected in blood carboxyhemoglobin levels in rats of this study and none were observed. Methylene chloride exposed male and female rats had elevated carboxyhemoglobin values compared to control values with no indications of a dose-response relationship. Both male and female hamsters exposed to 500, 1500, or 3500 ppm had greater carboxyhemoglobin elevations than rats. There are no data on the metabolism of methylene chloride by hamsters. However, in both rats and hamsters, the alteration in carboxyhemoglobin level was independent of duration of exposure. This indicated both a lack of accumulation of carboxyhemoglobin with repeated daily exposures and a lack of demonstrable effect of repeated methylene chloride exposures on this metabolic pathway for methylene chloride to carbon monoxide. Another significant observation in this study was the absence of evidence for cardiac or cardiovascular effects due to prolonged, repeated high level methylene chloride exposure and the attendant carboxyhemoglobin burden in either rats or hamsters.",
