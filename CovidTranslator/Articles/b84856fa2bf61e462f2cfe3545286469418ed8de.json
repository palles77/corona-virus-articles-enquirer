It is essential for the interaction of the virons with host cell receptors and subsequent fusion of the viral envelop with host cell membrane to allow infection. Some spike proteins of coronavirus, such as MHV, HCoV-OC43, AIBV and BcoV, are proteolytically cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2. In contrast, TGV, FIPV and HCoV-229E are not. Many studies have shown that the cleavage of spike protein seriously affects its function. In order to investigate the maturation and proteolytic processing of the S protein of SARS CoV, we generated S1 and S2 subunit specific antibodies (Abs) as well as N, E and 3CL protein-specific Abs. Our results showed that the antibodies could efficiently and specifically bind to their corresponding proteins from E.coli expressed or lysate of SARS-CoV infected Vero-E6 cells by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, the anti-S1 and S2 Abs were proved to be capable of binding to SARS CoV under electron microscope observation. When S2 Ab was used to perform immune precipitation with lysate of SARS-CoV infected cells, a cleaved S2 fragment was detected with S2-specific mAb by Western blot analysis. The data demonstrated that the cleavage of S protein was observed in the lysate, indicating that proteolytic processing of S protein is present in host cells.",

The full lengths of spike protein (S), and its subunits, S1 and S2, and small envelope (E) protein were expressed as GST-fusion proteins. Vector with His-tag was linked to the sequences of 3CL and nucleocapsid (N) genes. Most of S, S1 and S2 proteins were found in the insoluble fraction of the cell lysates, whereas N, E and 3CL proteins were found in the soluble fraction. The S, S1, S2 proteins were purified by Model 422 Electro-Eluter (Bio-rad) while E protein was purified by Glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and 3CL proteinase and N protein were purified by Ni-column.

For example, assuming the cleavage was very important for the SRAS-CoV infection, the inhibition of this processes may consequently stop the virus infection. Our finding is consistent with the results from Dr. Marcus Eickmann's group, which also demonstrated that the S protein of SRAS-CoV was cleaved into S1 and S2 fragments in Vero E6 cells (personal communication). Taken together, we have generated antibodies against some of the most important proteins of SARS-CoV and among these, antibodies against S1, S2 and N protein had relatively high specificity and affinity of binding to SARS-CoV.
