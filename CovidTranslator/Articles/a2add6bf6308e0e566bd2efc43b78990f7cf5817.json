Both TLR-dependent and -independent pathways engage the IjB kinase (IKK) complex and related kinases TBK-1 and IKKe. Activation of the nuclear factor jB (NF-jB) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factor pathways are essential immediate early steps of immune activation; as a result, both pathways represent prime candidates for viral interference.

Many viruses disrupt the innate immune responses and NF-kB through the use of multifunctional viral proteins that target specific aspects of the NF-kB pathway. On the other hand, certain viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I), human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have incorporated aspects of NF-kB signaling into their life cycle and pathogenicity, and thus induce NF-kB activation (Hiscott et al., 2001) . A convergence of knowledge about the host innate immune response to viral pathogens and the strategies used by viruses to short circuit the early host response, coupled with the identification of potential targets for therapeutic intervention in viral diseases, has created an energized period of research in this important area of molecular virology. This review discusses three rapidly evolving areas of research on viral pathogenesis: the recognition and innate immune response to virus infection, the involvement of NF-kB in the host response and the multitude of strategies used by different viruses to manipulate the NF-kB pathway. Because the organization of the mammalian NF-kB family of transcription factors as well as the knockout phenotypes of the NF-kB and IkB kinase (IKK)-deficient mice are described elsewhere in this issue (see Gerondakis et al., 2006; Gilmore, 2006) , this information will not be reiterated here.",

Inducible IKK (IKKe/IKKi) was isolated using a subtractive hybridization technique from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophages (Shimada et al., 1999) , as well as from an EST database search for IKK homologs (Peters et al., 2000) . The TBK-1/NAK/T2K kinase has been characterized as an IKK homolog involved in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a-mediated NF-kB activation (Pomerantz and Baltimore, 1999; Bonnard et al., 2000) , acting upstream of IKKb (Tojima et al., 2000) . Despite the homology and functional similarities between TBK-1 and IKKe, the expression patterns of these two IKK related kinases are considerably different. TBK-1 expression is ubiquitous and constitutive in a wide variety of cells, while IKKe expression is relegated to cells of the immune compartment (Shimada et al., 1999; Peters and Maniatis, 2001 ), but is inducible in non-hematopoietic cells by stimulation with activating agents such as TNF, PMA, LPS and virus infection (Shimada et al., 1999; Aupperle et al., 2001; Kravchenko et al., 2003; Hemmi et al., 2004) through an NF-kB-dependent mechanism involving upregulation of IKKe expression by C/EBPd and C/EBPb (Kravchenko et al., 2003) .",

Like the classical IKK kinases IKKa and IKKb, the IKK-related kinases (IKKe and TBK-1) contain a catalytic kinase domain, a leucine zipper domain and a helix-loop-helix domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions (Pomerantz and Baltimore, 1999; Shimada et al., 1999; Tojima et al., 2000; Peters and Maniatis, 2001) . IKKe and TBK-1 are 64% homologous to each other, but exhibit limited homology to the classical IKKa and b kinases, with about 33% sequence identity within the kinase domain (Pomerantz and Baltimore, 1999; Shimada et al., 1999; Peters et al., 2000; Tojima et al., 2000) . IKKe and TBK-1 also possess a kinase activation loop located between kinase subdomains VII and VIII; serine phosphorylation within the activation loop is required for kinase autophosphorylation and induction of enzymatic activity (Shimada et al., 1999; Peters et al., 2000; Kishore et al., 2002) . However, different from IKKa and IKKb, the primary amino-acid sequence of the IKKe and TBK-1 activation loop does not fit a canonical MEK consensus motif (Shimada et al., 1999; Peters et al., 2000; Kishore et al., 2002) ; that is, the Ser-176 residue is replaced with glycine -resulting in an SXXXG sequence. A serine to alanine substitution at position 172 abolishes IKKe and TBK-1 catalytic activation. Differences within the activation loop sequence are consistent with the failure of MEKK1 or NIK expression to augment IKK-related kinase activity, as occurs with canonical IKKs (Shimada et al., 1999) . In contrast to IKKa and IKKb, an S172E phosphomimetic mutation does not generate a constitutively active IKKe or TBK-1 kinase, but instead decreases catalytic activity (Shimada et al., 1999; Peters et al., 2000) .",

Overexpression of IKKe or TBK-1 induces phosphorylation of I-TRAF/TANK, which results in its dissociation from TRAF2 and subsequent activation of NF-kB transcription through the canonical IKK pathway (Pomerantz and Baltimore, 1999; Nomura et al., 2000) . The NAK associated protein 1 (NAP1), a homolog of I-TRAF/TANK, has also been shown to directly interact with TBK-1 and IKKe (Fujita et al., 2003) . Overexpression of NAP1 specifically enhances cytokine induction of an Figure 1 Comparison of the IKK family: classical IKK kinases vs IKK-related kinases. The four IKK kinases are classified into two subgroups, based on sequence homology and substrate specificity. Numbers below the figure indicate the amino-acid residue number and important domains are indicated above (catalytic kinase domain; leucine zipper; helix-loop-helix). Classical IKK kinases -IKKa and IKKb -share 52% overall homology to each other and the IKK-related kinases IKKe and TBK-1 share 61% overall homology to each other. Homology between the subgroups is limited, with 27% overall homology and approximately 33% homology within the catalytic kinase domain. The positions of critical residues involved in catalytic activity are represented. Mutation K44A (IKKa and IKKb) or K38A (IKKe and TBK-1) within the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain generates a dominant-negative kinase; phosphomimetic mutations S176/180E (IKKa) or S177/181E (IKKb) within the kinase activation loop generates a constitutively active kinase. NF-kB-dependent reporter gene, while in vivo depletion of NAP1 reduces NF-kB-dependent reporter gene expression and sensitizes cells to TNFa-induced apoptosis (Fujita et al., 2003) . It is possible that I-TRAF/ TANK or NAP1, or perhaps both, regulate a TBK-1 and IKKe complex through an essential adaptor function, much like the NEMO regulates the classical IKK complex (Rothwarf et al., 1998; Yamaoka et al., 1998; Makris et al., 2000; Rudolph et al., 2000) . Physical association between TANK and NEMO suggest that the canonical IKK complex and the IKK-related kinases exist as a physically associated signaling complex responsible for phosphorylation of additional transcription factors (Chariot et al., 2002) . A recent study has also demonstrated a role for Hsp90 in the regulation of TBK-1 and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 activity .",

            "text": "An important breakthrough in our understanding of the physiological function of TBK-1 and IKKe was the demonstration that the IRF-3 and IRF-7 transcription factors are the primary in vivo targets of the IKK-related kinases. C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IRF-7 can induce nuclear localization, DNA binding and transactivation in cells overexpressing TBK-1 or IKKe (Sharma et al., 2003; Fitzgerald et al., 2003a) . Both kinases directly phosphorylate IRF-3 and IRF-7 at key residues within their C-terminal signal-responsive domain (McWhirter et al., 2004; tenOever et al., 2004) and both kinases target identical serine residues Paz et al., 2006) . Importantly, expression of the IKK-related kinases is essential to initiate IRF signaling in response to de novo Sendai, Vesicular Somatitis Virus (VSV) or measles virus infection, and treatment with RNAi directed against either IKKe or TBK-1 reduces VSV-inducible IRF-3 phosphorylation and IRF-dependent gene expression in human cells. Furthermore, expression of the IKK-related kinases generates an IRF-3-dependent antiviral state in vivo that can inhibit de novo VSV replication (Sharma et al., 2003; tenOever et al., 2004) . Subsequent analysis of the response to virus infection in TBK1\u00c0/\u00c0 and IKKe\u00c0/\u00c0 mice demonstrated that TBK-1 is principally involved in IRF-3 and IRF-7 phosphorylation and development of the antiviral response, with only an accessory role associated with IKKe Perry et al., 2004) . Ongoing studies however suggest that TBK-1 and IKKe are not redundant, but that IKKe selectively regulates a subset of interferon-responsive antiviral genes during influenza virus infection (tenOever and Maniatis, personal communication) .",

Early response genes are rapidly induced by virus infection and activation of latent, pre-existing IRF-3 in conjunction with ATF-2/c-jun and NF-kB occurs without the need for de novo protein synthesis. In nonhematopoietic cells, type I IFN signaling in a paracrine fashion results in de novo expression of IRF-7, which acts together with IRF-3 to increase the production of multiple IFNa subtypes, thus amplifying the antiviral response to paramyxovirus infection (Marie et al., 1998; Lin et al., 2000; Sato et al., 2000) .",

Significantly, mutation of five clustered residues (within aa 396-405) in IRF-3 to the phosphomimetic glutamic acid generates a constitutively active form of IRF-3 (IRF-3 5D) that can efficiently transactivate IRF-3-dependent promoters (Lin et al., , 1999 and can stimulate cellular apoptosis in the absence of virus infection (Heylbroeck et al., 2000) . Phosphorylation of the IRF-7 C terminus by the IKK-related kinases directly targets two serine residues, Ser-477 and Ser-479.

These studies describe a unique autoinhibitory mechanism for IRF-3 whereby N-and C-terminal autoinhibitory domains within the C-terminal IRF association domain (IAD) interact to form a highly condensed hydrophobic core. This interaction buries several key residues within the IAD involved in dimerization of the active protein, and therefore required for nuclear accumulation, DNA binding and transactivation by IRF-3. It is proposed that virus-inducible, C-terminal phosphorylation events abolish autoinhibitory interactions by introducing charge repulsions within this region that unmask the IAD active site and realign the DNA-binding domain to form the transcriptionally active IRF-3 protein with the capacity to recruit the CBP histone acetyltransferase (Qin et al., 2003 (Qin et al., , 2005 . Ser-386 in IRF-3 appears to be the primary target for virus-inducible, as well as IKKeand TBK-1-mediated phosphorylation during the initial stages of activation, because of its accessibility in the three-dimensional structure (Takahasi et al., 2003) . Interestingly, two groups noted that the C-terminal domain of IRF-3 exhibits sequence similarity to the Mad homology 2 domain of the Smad family of transcriptional regulator proteins, suggesting common molecular mechanisms of action among a superfamily of signaling mediators as well as a common evolutionary relationship between the IRF and Smad proteins (Qin et al., 2003; Takahasi et al., 2003) .",

The IFNb promoter-enhancer region contains four positive (PRDI-IV) and one negative regulatory domains (NRDI): PRDI and III contain the binding sites for IRF-7 and IRF-3, respectively, as well as for other IRF members (Civas et al., 2006) ; PRDII is recognized by NF-kB heterodimers; and PRDIV by ATF-2 and c-Jun heterodimers (Hiscott et al., 1989; Visvanathan and Goodbourn, 1989; Thanos and Maniatis, 1995a; Chu et al., 1999a) . Virus infection leads to the recruitment of histone acetyltransferase co-activators (GCN5 and CBP/p300), as well as the high mobility group protein (HMG 1(Y)), which binds to the minor groove of DNA at four sites within the IFNb enhancer and contributes to the stability of the enhanceosome Maniatis, 1992, 1995a; Yie et al., 1997) .",

TRIF consists of an N-terminal proline-rich domain, a TIR domain, and C-terminal proline-rich domain (Oshiumi et al., 2003b; Yamamoto et al., 2002b) . The N-terminal region of TRIF directly associates with TBK-1 (Fitzgerald et al., 2003a; Jiang et al., 2004) and TRAF6, a ubiquitin ligase . Following virus infection, the association with TRAF6 leads to activation of the canonical IKK complex (IKKa/IKKb/NEMO) and NF-kB, which upregulates the transcription of proinflammatory genes such as IL-6, IL-1b and TNF-a. The recruitment of TBK-1 to the C-terminal region of TRIF initiates a signaling cascade that culminates in IRF-3 activation and the induction of IFNb, RANTES and IP-10. In addition, the phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase pathway (PI3K) also contributes to dsRNA and TLR3-dependent IRF-3 phosphorylation. Specific mutations of tyrosine residue Tyr-759 and Tyr-858 inhibit the recruitment of PI3K to the receptor and TBK-1 activation, respectively (Sarkar et al., 2004) . As a result, partial IRF-3 phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear translocation occur, but activation of the IFNb promoter is inhibited, suggesting that the PI3K-Akt pathway is essential for full dsRNA signaling to IRF-3 (Sarkar et al., 2004) .",

Mutation of the TRAF6 binding motifs of TRIF abolishes binding between TRIF and TRAF6, and partially reduces NF-kB promoter activity (Jiang et al., 2004) . The C-terminal region of TRIF recruits the kinase receptor interacting Figure 2 Summary of the signaling pathways that recognize virus infection. Virus replication results in the production of PAMPs such as single-and double-stranded RNA. Viral nucleic acids trigger multiple signaling cascades through Toll-like-receptor-dependent (TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9) and TLR-independent (RIG-I and Mda-5) pathways leading to kinase activation through TRAF family members. In pDCs, TLR7 or TLR9 engagement by ssRNA leads to direct activation of IRF-7 through MyD88/TRAF6/IRAK4/ IRAK1 recruitment. TRIF and MyD88 are the adaptors linking TLRs to the TRAF proteins, whereas MAVS links RIG-1 and Mda-5 to TRAF3. TRAF-dependent induction of the kinases JNK, IKKa, IKKb, IKKe, TBK-1 and IRAK-1 induce the binding of ATF2-cJun, NF-kB (p50-RelA), IRF-3 and IRF-7 to sequence-specific PRD located upstream of the IFNb start site. Coordinated assembly of these factors forms the IFNb enhanceosome, which is responsible for the transcriptional induction of this antiviral cytokine (modified from tenOever and Maniatis, 2006) . protein (RIP1) through its RIP homotypic interaction motif and also induces the NF-kB pathway, whereas RIP3 inhibits this pathway (Sun et al., 2002; Meylan et al., 2004) .",

TLR4, the receptor for LPS, was the first mammalian homolog of Drosophila Toll gene product to be discovered (Medzhitov and Janeway, 1997) and is a type I transmembrane protein. The TLR4 cytoplasmic domain contains a Toll-interleukin (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domain, which is common to all TLRs. Upon bacterial infection, lipid-binding protein (LBP), an acute phase protein that circulates in the liver, binds to the lipid A moiety of LPS (Schumann et al., 1990) . Soluble CD14 binds and concentrates LPS present outside the cell. LBP-bound LPS forms a ternary complex with CD14, enabling the transfer of LPS to the TLR4-MD2 complex (Tobias et al., 1995) . MD-2 is a secreted glycoprotein that acts as an extracellular adaptor protein that binds LPS and is essential for TLR4 signaling to occur (Visintin et al., 2003) . Upon binding of LPS, the TLR4-MD2 complex homodimerizes and initiates the ensuing signaling cascade that bifurcates into two distinct pathways: MyD88-independent and MyD88-dependent pathways.",

MyD88 recruitment to TLR4 is followed by the recruitment of IRAK4 and IRAK1 along with the adapter TRAF6 (Li et al., 2002) , resulting in the formation of the receptor complex. During the formation of this complex IRAK4 is activated, leading to the hyperphosphorylation of IRAK1, which then leads to the dissociation of the negative regulator of IRAK1, Tollip. Hyperphosphorylated IRAK1 dissociates from the receptor complex to form a new complex with IRAK2 and TRAF6. Subsequently, TRAF6 physically interacts with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme complex Ubc13/Uev1A to catalyse the formation of a unique Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chain on IKK that positively regulates the NF-kB signaling pathway (Deng et al., 2000) . TRAF6 then becomes activated, associates with TAK-1 binding protein (TAB2), which in turn activates the MAPK kinase TAK-1 (transforming growth factorb-activated kinase), which is constitutively associated with its adaptor protein TAB1. This leads to the activation of MAPKs, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In addition, TRAF6 activates the IKK complex and NF-kB (reviewed in Akira et al., 2006) .",

IRAK-4 phosphorylates IRAK-1, triggering autophosphorylation of IRAK-1 and increasing its affinity for TRAF6 . In vitro studies have shown that IRAK-1 can bind and phosphorylate IRF-7, although to date phosphorylation of endogenous IRF7 by IRAK-1 has not been demonstrated. In IRAK-1 knockout mice, both TLR7-and TLR9-mediated IFNa production is abolished. In TLR7-and TLR9-mediated responses, MyD88 interacts with and activates IRF-7 but fails to activate IRF-3. pDCs derived from IRF-7\u00c0/\u00c0 mice are non-responsive for IFN induction upon TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation, whereas pDCs from IRF-3\u00c0/\u00c0 mice show normal IFN induction. Hence, IRF-3 appears dispensable for the induction of type I IFN in pDCs (Honda et al., 2005) . Furthermore, induction of CD8 \u00fe T-cell responses was completely dependent on IRF-7. Therefore, IRF-7 is not only important in the development of innate immunity but also clearly plays a central role in adaptive immunity (Honda et al., 2005) .",

Unmethylated CpG DNA binds to TLR9 in the endosomal compartment and activates IRF-7 in pDCs (Latz et al., 2004; Uematsu et al., 2005) . TLR9 signals by recruiting MyD88 and IRAK family members through homophilic interactions between their death domains ( Figure 2 ) (Dunne and O'Neill, 2003) . The recruited IRAK-4 phosphorylates IRAK-1, which enables IRAK-1 to interact with TRAF6, leading to the phosphorylation of IRF-7 and subsequent production of type I IFN . TBK-1\u00c0/\u00c0 or IKKe\u00c0/\u00c0 pDCs stimulated with CpG ODN have normal IFNa production, whereas in IRAK1-deficient mice TLR7-and TLR9-mediated IFNa production is abolished, suggesting that IRF-7 phosphorylation occurs independently of TBK/IKKe. Moreover, IRAK-1 physically interacts with and phosphorylates IRF-7 in vitro , providing further evidence that IRAK1 directly activates IRF-7. IRAK-1 is dispensible for TLR9-mediated induction of NF-kB and is therefore not involved in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa, IL-6 and IL-12p40. In contrast, IRAK-4 is essential for the activation of NF-kB and optimal induction of proinflammatory cytokines (Lye et al., 2004) . In DCs, another IRF family member -IRF-8 -is essential for NF-kB activation in TLR9 signaling (Tsujimura et al., 2004) ; IRF-8\u00c0/\u00c0 mice are completely unresponsive to unmethylated CpG and fail to induce NF-kB.

Early viral replicative intermediates are detected by two recently characterized DExD/H box RNA helicases, RIG-I (Yoneyama et al., 2004) and Mda-5 (Andrejeva et al., 2004) that recognize viral double-stranded RNA and transmit signals to an independent downstream pathway ( Figure 2 ). Structurally, RIG-I contains two caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARD) at its N-terminus and RNA helicase activity in the C-terminal portion of the molecule (Yoneyama et al., 2004) . The helicase domain possesses ATPase activity and is responsible for dsRNA recognition and binding, which leads to dimerization and structural alterations that enable the CARD domain to interact with other downstream adapter protein(s). RIG-I signaling ultimately engages the canonical IKK kinase complex, the stress activated kinases, as well as the IKK-related kinases TBK-1 and IKKe, leading to phosphorylation and activation of NF-kB, ATF-2/c-jun and IRF-3 transcription factors, respectively. Coordinated activation of these transcription factors results in the formation of a transcriptionally competent enhanceosome that triggers IFNb production (Maniatis et al., 1998) .",

IFNb promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) was identified by Kawai et al. (2005) , who demonstrated that overexpression of IPS-1 activates the IFNa, IFNb, and NF-kB promoters in a TBK-1 dependent fashion. IPS-1 contains an N-terminal CARD domain like RIG-1 and a C-terminal effector domain that recruits the adaptor FADD and the kinase RIP1. The same molecule, but named mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), was identified by Chen's group who recognized, in addition to its essential role in RIG-I dependent signaling, that a C-terminal transmembrane domain localized MAVS to the mitochondrial membrane, thus suggesting a novel role for mitochondrial signaling in the cellular innate response (Seth et al., 2005) . Xu et al. (2005) demonstrated that virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA) was a critical component of IFNb signaling, and suggested that VISA may mediate the bifurcation of the NF-kB and IRF-3 activation pathways in both TLR3 and RIG-I virus-triggered pathways. Finally, Meylan et al. (2005) described Cardif, which interacts with RIG-I via N-terminal CARD domain interactions and recruits IKKa, IKKb and IKKe kinases through its C-terminal region. Overexpression of Cardif results in IFNb and NF-kB promoter activation, and knockdown by siRNA inhibits RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses. Importantly, this latter study demonstrates that Cardif is cleaved at its C-terminal end -adjacent to the mitochondrial targeting domain -by the NS3-4A protease of Hepatitis C virus (see below).",

Many viruses utilize multifunctional viral proteins to hijack and stimulate the NF-kB signaling pathway as part of their life cycle, diverting NF-kB immune regulatory functions to favor viral replication or to modulate cellular apoptosis and growth pathways (Table 1) . Chronic activation of the NF-kB pathway due to persistent viral infection can promote inflammation and the progression to malignancy (reviewed in Karin, 2006) . Below, we present a cross-section of the well-studied examples of viruses that modulate the NF-kB pathway and innate immune responses, and describe how these events contribute to viral pathogenesis and malignant transformation. Extensive recent reviews on these subjects are available (Gilmore and Mosialos, 2003; Conzelmann, 2005; Sun and Yamaoka, 2005; Brinkmann and Schulz, 2006; Karin, 2006) . Perhaps the most blatant example of viral 'abuse' of the NF-kB pathway is the incorporation and use of NF-kB DNA binding sites in the promoters of many different classes of viruses, including human pathogens such as HIV-1, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, human papillomavirus type 16, hepatitis B virus and EBV. A partial list of animal viruses that regulate their transcription through the use of NF-kB also includes avian and bovine leukosis viruses, the papovaviruses SV40, JC and BK, and adenoviruses (reviewed in Gilmore and Mosialos, 2003) .",

For most viral subtypes, the HIV-1 promoter has two NF-kB binding sites located approximately 100 bp from the start site of transcription (Hiscott et al., 2001) , which act in synergy with nearby Sp1 binding sites to drive HIV-1 transcription. Unstimulated CD4 \u00fe T cells have primarily p50-p50 DNA-binding activity, but T-cell activation leads to recruitment of p50-RelA complexes and enhanced expression from the HIV-1 LTR. The absolute requirement for these sites during the HIV-1 life cycle continues to be controversial, given that NF-kB sites are required for HIV transcription in some, but not all, cell types. Expression of the IkBa super-repressor reduces HIV-1 viral replication in T-cell cultures in vitro (Kwon et al., 1998; Quinto et al., 1999) , but mutation of the NF-kB sites does not absolutely block virus growth (Chen et al., 1997) . Furthermore, extensive heterogeneity in the architecture of the HIV-1 LTR with respect to functional NF-kB sites has been described, suggesting that functionality of these sites may be subject to mutational pressures (Roof et al., 2002; van Opijnen et al., 2004) .",

Rev-T, originally isolated from a turkey reticular malignancy, is a highly oncogenic virus that induces a fatal lymphoma/ leukemia in young birds and efficiently transforms and immortalizes chicken lymphoid cells in vitro. Overexpression of chicken, mouse or human c-Rel can also transform chicken lymphoid cells in vitro, although normal c-Rel is less efficient than v-Rel in transforming primary lymphoid cells (Gilmore et al., 2001) . In addition, T-cell-specific expression of v-rel in transgenic mice results in the development of T-cell lymphomas (Carrasco et al., 1996) . Four parameters determine the transforming activity of mutated v-Rel: (1) high-level expression; (2) homodimer formation; (3) DNA-binding activity; and (4) intact transcriptional activation potential (reviewed in Gilmore, 1999) .",

The C-terminal deletion in v-Rel removes a strong c-Rel transactivation domain; thus, v-Rel is generally a weaker activator of transcription than c-Rel in many assays. However, inhibition of v-Rel by IkBa is also less effective than c-Rel, in part due to internal mutations in v-Rel that reduce its affinity for IkBa (Sachdev et al., 1998) . Thus, vRel transcriptional activity is less tightly regulated than its normal cellular counterpart. Many of the target genes that are affected by v-Rel in transformed lymphoid cells control growth or apoptosis, including genes encoding growth promoting transcription factors (c-Rel, c-Jun, STAT1 and IRF4), cytokine receptors (IL-2Ra), and anti-apoptotic proteins (IAP1) (reviewed in Gilmore, 1999) . Thus, v-Rel impinges on various growth-promoting and survival pathways as part of its transforming process. Although v-Rel can transform a variety of cell types in vitro, its most potent oncogenic activity appears to be directed towards cells in the B-cell lineage. As discussed Courtois and Gilmore, 2006) , and it is likely that the mechanism by which v-Rel and overexpressed c-Rel proteins induce malignant transformation of avian lymphoid cells is similar to the mechanism by which REL gene amplification contributes to human B-cell malignancies.",

These sequences have been termed transformation effector site (TES)-1 (aa 187-231) and TES-2 (aa 352-386) or C-terminal NF-kB activating regions (CTAR)-1 and CTAR-2. (Huen et al., 1995; Mitchell and Sugden, 1995) . The fact that the same regions in LMP-1 that mediate NF-kB activation (CTAR-1 and -2) are necessary for B-cell transformation (TES-1 and -2) provides strong evidence that these two processes are intimately linked. NF-kB activation by LMP-1 is mediated by the recruitment of cellular adaptor proteins -TRAFs and TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD) -to the C-terminal domain (reviewed in Brinkmann and Schulz, 2006) . Approximately 20-30% of the LMP1-induced NF-kB activation is mediated by CTAR1, whereas 70-80% is transduced by CTAR2. The principal mediators of NF-kB signaling from CTAR2 are TRAF6 and IRAK1, as well as TRADD (Izumi et al., 1997) and RIP (Brinkmann and Schulz, 2006) . LMP-1-mediated activation of the classical NF-kB requires IRAK1 and TRAF6, leading to the activation of IKKb . Surprisingly, activation of NF-kB p65/p50 heterodimers occurs independently of IKKa and NEMO. IRAK1 acts as a scaffolding protein for the recruitment of TRAF6 and IRAK1 kinase activity is not required for the activation of the IKK complex or the phosphorylation of IkBa, but rather is necessary for the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 and NF-kB transcriptional activity. In addition, the MAP3K TAK1 is involved in CTAR2-mediated activation of NF-kB, possibly acting upstream of IKKb . CTAR1 directly recruits TRAF3 through a consensus PXQXT motif (Mosialos et al., 1995; Devergne et al., 1996 Devergne et al., , 1998 ) and indirectly interacts with TRAFs 1, 2 and 5 possibly due to oligomerization with TRAF3. Recruitment of TRAF3 leads to the activation of NIK and activation of the non-canonnical NF-kB pathway through IKKa-mediated phosphorylation of p100 followed by proteasome-mediated processing of the precursor and generation of p52 (Atkinson et al., 2003; Luftig et al., 2004) .",

For example, previous reports using dominant-negative forms of NIK, IKKa and IKKb all reduced activation of NF-kB by LMP-1 (Sylla et al., 1998) ; whether this demonstrates the existence of alternative pathways of NF-kB activation by LMP-1 remains to be established. As well, it has recently been shown that TRAF2 and TRAF6 can act as ubiquitin ligases leading to activation of the IKK complex (reviewed in Chen, 2005) , but the role of TRAF ubiquitination with regard of LMP-1 activation of NF-kB remains controversial (Luftig et al., 2003) .

Expression of ORF74 can activate NF-kB and consequently induce the expression of several NF-kB target genes, including ones encoding cytokines, angiogenesis factors and cell-surface adhesion molecules (Pati et al., 2001; Schwarz and Murphy, 2001) . Interestingly, coexpression of HIV-1 Tat enhances both ORF74-induced activation of NF-kB and ORF74-induced tumorigenesis (Guo et al., 2004) . The K15 viral product of HHV-8 encodes a multipass transmembrane protein reminiscent of EBV's LMP-1 (reviewed in Brinkmann and Schulz, 2006) . The full-length K15 protein localizes to lipid rafts and associates with TRAF1, -2 and -3 to activate the NF-kB pathway. In contrast to these viral activators, the HHV-8 K1 protein, a tyrosine kinase immunoreceptor-like protein, has been shown to inhibit activation of NF-kB; thus, HHV-8 may modulate NF-kB activity through both positive and negative pathways (Lee et al., 2002) .",

HTLV-1-induced deregulation of the lymphocyte gene expression pattern, a key event in HTLV-1-induced transformation, is attributed to the activity of the virally encoded 40-kDa Tax oncoprotein. Tax is a regulator of both cellular and viral gene expression, and, as such, Tax is essential for both viral replication and pathogenesis. Tax is transcribed early in virus infection from a distal coding region of the HTLV-1 genome, which lies adjacent to the 3 0 LTR. Although leukemic cells from ATL patients frequently have deleted HTLV-1 proviral genomes, the tax region is selectively retained in these cells (Grassmann et al., 2005) . Ectopic expression of the tax gene is necessary and sufficient to immortalize primary human T-lymphocytes (Wano et al., 1988; Akagi et al., 1995) . Mice stably expressing the tax transgene have been shown to develop soft tissue tumors Nerenberg et al., 1987) or large granular lymphocytic leukemia (Grossman et al., 1995) .",

Although Tax lacks a classical DNA-binding domain, Tax activates transcription by functioning as an adaptor protein that interacts with cellular transcription factors, including the CREB/ATF and NF-kB (Bex and Gaynor, 1998; Sun and Ballard, 1999; Yoshida, 2001; Pise-Masison et al., 2005) . Tax increases LTR-dependent transcription primarily by interaction of a Tax-CREB complex with the viral 21 bp Tax-responsive element (Yoshida, 2001) . The N-terminal domain of Tax interacts with the basic leucine zipper (bZip) domain of the cellular CREB/ATF proteins (Bex and Gaynor, 1998) and guides CREB/ATF dimers to the proviral promoter (Lenzmeier et al., 1998 (Lenzmeier et al., , 1999 . Acting as a molecular bridge, the C-terminal end of Tax recruits the transcriptional coactivator CBP to the CREB/ATF dimer, which drives proviral transcription (Kwok et al., 1996; Bex and Gaynor, 1998; Kashanchi and Brady, 2005) . As CBP is present in limiting concentrations within a host cell, high Tax expression during the early stages of HTLV-1 infection alters the cellular gene expression profile, by favoring transcription driven by proteins which bind to Tax, such as CREB/ATF, serum response factor and NF-kB (Yoshida, 1994 (Yoshida, , 2001 Bex and Gaynor, 1998; Sun and Ballard, 1999) .",

            "text": "Tax-induced degradation of IkB proteins. The involvement of cellular signaling pathways in Tax activation of NF-kB was first suggested by the finding that IkBa undergoes constitutive phosphorylation and degradation in HTLV-1-infected T cells (Sun et al., 1994; Lacoste et al., 1995) . Additional studies revealed that Tax induces the degradation of both IkBa and IkBb (Good and Sun, 1996; McKinsey et al., 1996) . It is now well established that the mechanism for Tax-mediated NF-kB activation involves direct activation of the classical IKK complex, which promotes constitutive IkB processing (Figure 3 ). Tax expression is associated with an elevated enzymatic activity of endogenous IKK complexes, which correlated with the phosphorylation and increased turnover of IkBa (Chu et al., 1998; Geleziunas et al., 1998) . The non-catalytic NEMO subunit of IKK is the target for Tax-induced activation of NF-kB; genetic complementation in fibroblasts deficient for expression of NEMO showed that expression of the adaptor protein is essential for the formation of an active complex between Tax and the classical IKK complex (Yamaoka et al., 1998) , and T-cell clones defective for Tax-mediated NF-kB-activation could be rescued by forced expression of wild-type NEMO . Similarly, interference with NEMO expression in T-cell lines using anti-sense oligonucleotides specifically abolishes Tax-mediated NF-kB activation, although CREB/ATF activation remains intact. Furthermore, a direct interaction between Tax and NEMO is required to activate the canonical IKK signaling pathway and this interaction requires leucinerich sequences in both proteins Chu et al., 1999b; . In addition, ubiquitination of Tax promotes its association with NEMO (Lamsoul et al., 2005; Nasr et al., 2006) . The Tax-NEMO interaction leads to activation of IKKb Chu et al., 1999b) , probably because the Tax-NEMO complex promotes clustering of the IKK components and this induced proximity leads to persistent phosphorylation of the activation loop in IKKb (Carter et al., 2003) . Indeed, fusion of NEMO, IKKa or IKKb to Tax is sufficient to activate IKK . Taxinduced activation of IKK then targets IkBa and IkBb for degradation, causing the chronic induction of NF-kB that is seen in Tax-transformed cells. Recently, the kinase AKT has also been shown to contribute to Tax-induced activation of IKKb (Jeong et al., 2005a) ; moreover, AKT is also required for IKKb-mediated phosphorylation of RelA, which leads to inhibition of p53-dependent transactivation (Jeong et al., 2005b) .",

In the case of p100, Tax binds to sequences within the Rel homology domain of p100 to bridge an interaction to the IKK complex through NEMO (Xiao et al., 2001) (Figure 3 ). This interaction then activates the catalytic activity of IKKa, and leads to the phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated processing of p100 to p52 (Qu et al., 2004) . Of note, Tax-induced processing of p100 to p52 appears to be distinct from normal processing of p100. In contrast to the cellular pathway, the Taxstimulated p100 processing does not require NIK. Furthermore, this virus-specific pathway requires both NEMO and IKKa, whereas the cellular pathway requires IKKa but not NEMO (Pomerantz et al., 2002; Hayden and Ghosh, 2004) . These results imply that Tax-stimulated non-canonical NF-kB signaling bypasses NIK but goes through IKKa (Jeang, 2001; Sun and Yamaoka, 2005) . More recent work suggests that Tax-induced deregulation of p100 processing involves both b-transducin repeat-containing proteindependent and -independent mechanisms, further suggesting the involvement of different mechanisms in cellular and viral pathways of p100 processing (Qu et al., 2004) .",

ATL develops as a clonal expansion of leukemic CD4 \u00fe T cells in HTLV-1-infected individuals only after a long latency, indicating that additional cellular alterations are required for T-cell leukemogenesis. Moreover, ATL cells from patients or T lymphocytes infected with HTLV-1 in vitro show chromosomal abnormalities (Jeang, 2001) . Constitutive. activation of NF-kB by Tax contributes to the abnormal growth and survival of T cells during the early stages of ATL disease progression. In this regard, NF-kB is responsible for Tax-mediated inhibition of certain genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint regulation (Mamane et al., 2005) , especially those encoding bpolymerase and p53 (Marriott and Semmes, 2005; Sun and Yamaoka, 2005) . Activation of NF-kB is also essential for Tax-induced IL-2-independent T-cell growth (Iwanaga et al., 1999) . ATL cells express high levels of both IL-2 and the IL2 receptor a-chain, both of which are induced by Tax and contain upstream NF-kB sites (Jeang, 2001; Sun and Yamaoka, 2005) . Thus, Taxdriven, NF-kB-mediated upregulation of IL-2 and the IL2Ra stimulates an autocrine activation loop that drives T-cell proliferation in HTLV-1-infected cells. The progressive nature of the disease in vivo is in part mimicked in cell culture; HTLV-1-infected primary human T cells undergo an initial phase of proliferation that is dependent on the IL-2/IL-2 receptor mediated autocrine proliferation, followed by an IL-2 independent phase, wherein leukemic T-cell growth is no longer dependent on IL-2 and cells acquire chromosomal alterations (Jeang, 2001; Sun and Yamaoka, 2005) .",

Interestingly, one of the member of the IRF family, IRF-4, was shown to be highly expressed in cells derived from patients with ATL and in HTLV-1-infected cell lines (Yamagata et al., 1996; Mamane et al., 2000; Sharma et al., 2002) . A detailed analysis of IRF-4 transcriptional regulation within the context of HTLV-1 infection has implicated the viral Tax protein in mediating chronic activation of the Sp1, NF-kB and NF-AT pathways leading to the overexpression of IRF-4 in ATL cells (Grumont and Gerondakis, 2000; Sharma et al., 2002) . The role of IRF-4 per se in HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis remains unclear. However, IRF-4 expression increases during the development of ATL, with IRF-4 expression levels highest during the late and ultimately fatal, acute phase of ATL (Imaizumi et al., 2001) .",

IRF-4 transcriptional downregulation of such genes would lead to an overall decrease in DNA repair and a subsequent increase in cellular mutations -as seen in HTLV-1infected T cells -thus contributing to cellular transformation. IRF-4 also downregulates several genes involved in apoptosis and immune regulation (Mamane et al., , 2005 .

To date, such experiments/clinical trials have not been performed. However, primary ATL cells that are highly refractory to conventional chemotherapies are nevertheless sensitive in vitro to the oncolytic effects of VSV, in part, due to the constitutive activation of the NF-kB pathway in ATL cells (Cesaire et al., 2006) .",

Of those individuals exposed to HCV, 80% become persistently infected (Hoofnagle, 2002) , which is often associated with significant liver disease, including chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (Alter and Seeff, 2000) . HCV is an enveloped virus classified in the Flaviviridae family (Rosenberg, 2001) . The positivestranded viral RNA genome encodes a single polyprotein precursor that is processed into structural proteins (core, envelope protein 1 (E1) and 2 (E2), p7) and non-structural (NS) proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) by host and viral proteases (reviewed in Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005; Wieland and Chisari, 2005) . The clinical outcome of HCV infection and the degree of liver damage is the result of complicated interactions between the virus and host immune responses (reviewed in Gale and Foy, 2005) . The immune response is rarely effective in eradicating the virus and the majority of HCV-infected subjects develop chronic infection, demonstrating that HCV may have evolved strategies to overcome or evade the immune response of the host (reviewed in Chisari, 2005) .",

Nevertheless, RIG-I is not a direct target of NS3-4A and likewise the kinases TBK-1 and IKKe are not subject to proteolytic cleavage by NS3-4A (Breiman et al., 2005; Foy et al., 2005; Sumpter et al., 2005) . Additional evidence for the importance of RIG-I comes from studies demonstrating that permissiveness for HCV RNA replication in Huh7.5 (Blight et al., 2003) cells is due to mutational inactivation of the CARD domain of RIG-I (Thr55 to Ile) . Furthermore, overexpression of IKKe results in strong inhibition of both negative and positive replicative strands of the HCV replicon, suggesting an important role for this kinase in the RIG-I pathway, as well as suppressing HCV replication (Breiman et al., 2005) . Thus, RIG-I signaling appears to be an essential pathway regulating cellular permissiveness to HCV replication.",

            "text": "African swine fever virus encodes proteins with opposing effects on NF-kB signaling African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large doublestranded DNA virus recently re-classified into a newly created family of viruses called Asfarviridae. ASFV contains more than 150 genes, several of which encode viral homologs of host proteins with the potential to modulate the immune response to virus infection (Yanez et al., 1995) . ASFV infects primarily macrophages and monocytes and induces a rapidly fatal hemorrhagic disease in pigs. Notably, ASFV infection is characterized by the absence of an acute inflammatory response and immune response and many of the NF-kBdependent cytokine genes are not induced upon infection of macrophages by ASFV (Powell et al., 1996) . Figure 4 TLR3-dependent and RIG-I-dependent signaling to the innate immune response: specific cleavage of signaling adapters by HCV NS3-4A protease. Engagement of endosome-associated TLR3 by dsRNA recruits the TRIF adaptor, resulting in the activation of TBK-1 and IKKe kinases that phosphorylate IRF-3 and IRF-7. TRIF also signals NF-kB activation via the IKKa/b complex, which phosphorylates IkBa, resulting in the release of the NF-kB DNA-binding subunits. The RIG-1 pathway activates NF-kB and IRF-3/7, following the recognition of incoming viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. RIG-I, through C-terminal RNA helicase domain, interacts with viral dsRNA and through the CARD domains interacts with the MAVS/IPS/VISA/Cardif adaptor. MAVS contains a transmembrane domain (TM) that localizes this adaptor to the mitochondria. NS3-4A protease activity of HCV cleaves the C-terminal domain of MAVS at Cys-508, disrupts RIG-I signaling to IFN activation and establishes persistent infection. NS3-4A also targets the TRIF adaptor molecule in the TLR3-dependent pathway (modified from Hiscott et al., 2006) . This unusual porcine virus is included here as a unique example of the distinct strategies used by viruses to evade NF-kB and immune response signaling. Two viral proteins A238L and A224L appear to have direct effects on the NF-kB pathway. The A238L protein has extensive sequence similarity to IkB proteins and can bind to and inhibit NF-kB (Powell et al., 1996; Revilla et al., 1998) . Interestingly, the A238L protein lacks the serine residues of IkBa required for signal-induced phosphorylation by IKK and for degradation. As such, A238L is resistant to signal-induced degradation (Tait et al., 2000) . Thus, while ASFV infection initially induces NF-kB, the degraded cellular IkBa is replaced by the viral IkB A238L, which stably inhibits the NF-kB complex (Tait et al., 2000) . Of note, A238L also inhibits calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that is required for the induction of the NFAT-dependent immune response genes (Miskin et al., 1998) , and the coactivator complex CBP/p300 (Granja et al., 2006) . The viral IkB homolog A238L, which is expressed early in ASFV infection, appears to block NF-kB-and NFAT-dependent immune and inflammatory responses.",

One virally encoded protein, A46R, was identified in a database search as a TIR domaincontaining protein (Bowie et al., 2000) , the only virally encoded TIR domain-containing protein identified to date. Recent experiments have demonstrated that A46R inhibits TRIF-mediated IRF-3 activation through the TLR3 pathway and induction of the TRIF-dependent gene RANTES (Stack et al., 2005) . Interestingly, A46R also binds three other TIR adaptors, MyD88, TIRAP/ Mal and TRAM, and disrupts NF-kB and MAP kinase activation (Stack et al., 2005) , hinting at broader effects on the host immune response. Importantly, vaccinia virus lacking the A46R gene was tested in a murine model of intranasal infection, and was shown to have reduced vaccinia virus virulence in vivo.",

This IFN inhibitory effect of influenza is mediated in part by the ability of the A/NS1 protein to inhibit IRF-3 and NF-kB activation; the B/NS1 protein also functions as an IFN antagonist, in part through the inhibition of the IFN-inducible protein protein kinase R (PKR) in vitro . Elimination of the NS1 gene from the influenze genome results in enhanced IRF-3 translocation and activity, and correlates with higher levels of Type 1 IFN. NS1 participates in both protein-RNA and proteinprotein interactions during infection. The N-terminal 73 amino acids of A/NS1 binds to dsRNA with low affinity (Noah and Krug, 2005) , but because the A/NS1 dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) has a lower affinity for dsRNA than cellular dsRBD , it is unclear that A/NS1 can compete with cellular dsRBDs during virus infection. The role of the dsRNAbinding activity of the NS1A protein during influenza A virus infection has not been identified. Latent protein kinase PKR is not activated in cells infected with a recombinant influenza A virus expressing an NS1A that lacks dsRNA-binding activity (Noah and Krug, 2005) ; therefore, dsRNA sequestration by NS1A does not appear to be the mechanism by which PKR activation is inhibited during influenza A virus infection.",

Recent sequence analysis of a large number of H5N1 viral particles has revealed that the NS1 protein of the majority of avian H5N1 contains a novel sequence motif -Glu-Ser-Glu-Val (ESEV) -that is predicted to mediate protein interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins which are involved in protein trafficking, cell morphology and organization. Virulent H5N1 viruses possess a different PDZ-binding sequence -Glu, Pro, Glu, Val (EPEV) -at the C-terminus of the NS1 protein whereas NS1 protein from low virulence influenza A viruses do not have a PDZ-binding motif (Obenauer et al., 2006) . The presence of these functional C-terminal PDZ-binding domains in NS1 of H5N1 viruses correlates with human virulence. These observations indicate that the PDZ-interaction domains of NS1 may contribute to virulence by binding cellular PDZ-containing proteins and disrupting their participation in important cellular processes (Krug, 2006) .",

The V and P proteins therefore have identical N-terminal moieties and specific C-terminal domains. V proteins of most paramyxoviruses are responsible for the pronounced resistance to IFN of these viruses. The V proteins associate with STAT1/STAT2 complexes and abolish IFN JAK/STAT signaling by targeting either STAT1 or STAT2 for proteasomal degradation or by interfering with STAT phosphorylation. In addition to V proteins, Sendai virus and measles virus encode one or more C proteins that are expressed from the P mRNAs by alternative translation initiation. These proteins do not share any sequences with the P or V proteins. In Sendai virus, multiple C proteins rather than the V protein abolish IFN STAT signaling; with measles virus, JAK/ STAT interference has been attributed to both C (Shaffer et al., 2003) and V proteins (Gotoh et al., 2002; Palosaari et al., 2003; Garcia-Sastre, 2004; Nagai and Kato, 2004; Ohno et al., 2004) .",

Ectopic expression of the SV5 V protein blocked induction of IFNb by dsRNA and virus infection.

HRSV and BRSV are highly resistant to treatment with IFNa/b (Andrejeva et al., 2004) , with the IFN resistance phenotype mapping to the NS genes (Schlender et al., 2000) . Viruses lacking either NS1 or NS2 lose their ability to replicate in IFN-treated cells, suggesting a cooperative function of the two proteins in counteracting antiviral IFN effects (Bossert and Conzelmann, 2002) . Further analyses of BRSV and HRSV NS gene deletion virus mutants revealed that the NS proteins are also critical for preventing induction of IFNb in RSVinfected cells (Bossert et al., 2003; Valarcher et al., 2003; Spann et al., 2004) . Recombinant viruses lacking either NS1 or NS2 displayed increased IRF-3 phosphorylation and activity compared to wild-type RSV. NF-kB activities remained high in cells infected with wild-type and NS deletion mutant viruses, indicating that RSV NS proteins specifically targeted the IRF-3 pathway (Bossert et al., 2003) , in contrast to the V proteins of paramyxoviruses, which inhibit both IRF-3 and NF-kB activation by blocking Mda-5.",

Recent evidence indicates that VP35 possesses dsRNA-binding activity, and two VP35 point mutants, R312A and K309A, were significantly impaired in their dsRNAbinding activity (Cardenas et al., 2006) . VP35 blocked activation of IRF-3 in cells overexpressing RIG-I, and the VP35 mutants impaired for dsRNA binding had decreased IFN antagonist activity. Wild-type VP35 and the R312A and K309A mutants were also able to inhibit IFNb promoter activity induced by the MAVS/Cardif adapter. These studies argue that dsRNA binding may contribute to VP35 antagonism of IFN signaling ( Figure 5 ). However, additional mechanisms of inhibition, at a point proximal to the IRF-3 kinases, may also exist (Cardenas et al., 2006) .",
