The lack of significant 283 difference in the levels of viral encoded protein (luciferase) production upon re-infection with 284 RCN, as shown in the booster study (Fig. 3) , may be important if bats had been previously exposed 285 to RCN, or if boost inoculations of RCN-vectored vaccine are necessary. While neither vector 286 caused clinical illness, the fact that RCN produced more viral encoded protein (luciferase) over a 287 longer period suggests it is a more immunogenic vector when expressing heterologous antigens. 288",

An average anti-rabies G titer of 5.14 IU at 60 294 dpi was detected in bats orally administered RCN-G , which is higher than the levels obtained after 295 vaccination with the VR-G construct in any previous studies, including oral, IM, and scarification 296 routes of exposure (28-30). While these differences may be due to the animal models used, this is 297 additional evidence of the superiority of the RCN vector over vaccinia in bat species.

Bats are fastidious 316 animals and spend a large proportion of their time self-grooming [53], which could lead to 317 significant oral exposure to topically applied vaccines.

Construction of Recombinant MVA-luc 118 Recombinant MVA-luc viruses were constructed as described elsewhere [39]. Briefly, CEF cells 119 were infected with MVA-GFP at a multiplicity of 0.05 PFU per cell; one hour later the cells were 120 transfected using the FuGENE\u00ae reagent protocol (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) with a pI2 transfer 121 plasmid containing 1) DNA flanking segments adjacent to deletion III within the HindIII A 122 fragment of MVA, 2) the Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) under the control of a p11 promoter, and 123 3) the firefly luciferase gene (luc) under the control of a strong synthetic early/late (SE/L) vaccinia 124 virus promoter upstream (S1 figure). At 48-72 hours post transfection, the cell cultures were put 125 through three freeze-thaw cycles, harvested, sonicated, and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes at 126 4\u00baC. The sonicated cell extracts were plated onto fresh BHK-21 cells and overlaid with 0.8% 127 agarose. After 48-72 hours, through the use of specific microscope filters, the recombinant viruses 128 were detected by the presence of the RFP gene, which replaced the GFP gene during homologous 129 recombination. Selected cell/virus samples were sonicated and plated again as described above. 130 After four consecutive rounds of plaque isolation, recombinant MVA-luc virus was confirmed by 131 PCR analysis using OneTaq\u00ae Quick-Load\u00ae 2X Master Mix with Standard Buffer (New England 132 BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA 01938, USA) amplifying the insertion at the Del III flanks using 133 ATGCGGCACCTCTCTTAA as a forward primer and CCAAAGCTTGCACATACATAAGTA as the 134 reverse primer. The virus subsequently amplified in freshly prepared CEF cells. 135 2.5. Bioluminescent Imaging 136 Biophotonic luminescent imaging (BLI) has been successfully used to assess the infectivity, 137 infection course, and tissue tropism of viruses and candidate vaccine vectors [40]. Unlike 138 traditional pathogenicity studies that require euthanasia of animals at different time points, BLI 139 allows study of the course of infection over time in a single host, increasing the information gained 140 while reducing the number of animals required. 141",

Fecal samples were also retrieved when available from the bags in which the individuals 174 were contained during imaging, placed in a 1.5ml tube without media. All samples were quickly 175 stored at -80\u00baC until testing. Prior to testing, 100\u03bcl DMEM media was added to fecal samples, 176 vortexed thoroughly and sonicated four times in a bath sonicator for 15 seconds. DNA was 177 extracted from 40\u03bcl of the samples using the Zymo Quick-gDNA\u2122 MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, 178 Irvine, CA 92614, U.S.A.), and a PCR assay was run to assess for presence of the inoculated virus. 179 PCR was performed with OneTaq\u00ae Quick-Load\u00ae 2X Master Mix with Standard Buffer (New 180 England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA 01938, USA) and primers targeting the luc insert flanks 181 [supplemental info]. The limit of detection for this PCR protocol was determined to be 0.125 182 picograms of DNA, or 6.8x10 4 copies, as determined by serial dilution of a known quantity of viral 183 DNA. Any samples positive by PCR were then assessed for levels of live virus by determining the 184 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). For RCN-luc samples, positive wells were assessed 185 by plaque observation, and the TCID50 was calculated and used to approximate plaque forming 186 units (PFU)/ml by the Spearman & K\u00e4rber algorithm [41]. For MVA-luc samples, positive wells 187 were assessed for viral titer by the luciferase marker using steadylite plus\u2122 (PerkinElmer Inc, 188 Waltham, MA 02451). Serial dilutions from 10 -2 to 10 -7 were made, and 100\u03bcl from each was used 189 to infect a 96 well plate with BHK-21 cells at ~80% confluency. Due to minimal sample volume 190 left, no smaller dilutions were possible. After 3 days of infection, 100\u03bcl of the steadylite reagent 191 was added to each well, mixed by pipetting, and after 15 minutes the plates were scanned in a 192 luminometer (Veritas\u2122 Microplate Luminometer, Turner BioSystems, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA 94085). 193 2.7. RCN-G Immunization 194 An additional group of five T. brasiliensis were housed separately in the same type of caging and 195 given RCN-G via the ON route to assess the immunogenicity of RCN-delivered rabies CVS strain 196 glycoprotein. For this exposure the bats were anesthetized with isoflurane prior to exposure. A 197 dose of 10 8 PFU of viral vaccine was given in 70\u03bcl sterile saline, split between 50 \u03bcl orally and 10 198 \u03bcl in each nare. Bats were monitored through their anesthesia recovery for 3 hours for potential 199 adverse events. Serum samples were obtained prior to vaccination and at 30 and 60 dpi and 200 tested for the presence of anti-rabies neutralizing antibodies by the rapid fluorescence focus 201 inhibition test (RFFIT).

Antibody Responses to RCN-G 250To assess the immunogenicity of RCN, an additional group of bats (n=5) was infected via the ON 251 route with RCN expressing rabies virus surface glycoprotein (RCN-G). Again, there was no 252 evidence of clinical disease in any of the vaccinated bats in this experiment.

While there is no \"protective\" level of rabies virus 259 neutralizing antibodies (RVNA), there is a positive correlation between RVNA titers and the level 260 of protection after virus challenge[22, 47-50]. Titers between 0.association between bats and zoonotic diseases, there is currently no significant effort 265 to decrease the incidence of important infectious diseases in these animals. Instead, efforts are 266 more focused on culling of populations (e.g. vampire bats in Latin America) or controlling disease 267 after spill-over into other animal hosts. The continued spillover of rabies virus strains to humans 268 and domestic animals from terrestrial carnivores has led to the development of successful oral 269 rabies vaccination (ORV) programs in Europe and North America. These campaigns often utilize 270 recombinant viral vectors that stimulate immunity to the surface glycoprotein of rabies when 271 ingested orally. When distributed in baits targeted toward certain rabies-carrying species, these 272 vaccines lead to protection from the virus and reduction in local incidence of disease, and even 273 local eradication of some strains of rabies [20, 51]. ORV programs are continually evolving and 274 making use of the best available vaccine technology and disease modeling studies. In this study 275 we assessed whether two attenuated poxviruses might be viable vaccine vectors in a bat species. 276 Through in vivo imaging studies we have demonstrated that attenuated MVA and RCN are able to 277 infect T. brasiliensis via the ON route for a limited time, without causing disease. Our studies 278 demonstrate the tissue tropism and course of infection after exposure of a new animal model, T. 279 brasiliensis, to attenuated orthopoxviruses. We show evidence of limited autologous spread of the 280 viruses after ON exposure, although there is no evidence that the virus spreads outside of GI-281 associated tissues. MVA was cleared faster and resulted in less detectable luminescence compared 282",
