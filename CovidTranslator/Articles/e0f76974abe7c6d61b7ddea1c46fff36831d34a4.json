Currently there 32 is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to 33 rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined 34 structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to 35 identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 virus main protease (M pro ). M pro is a key 36 CoV enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, 37 making it an attractive drug target for this virus 5,6 . Here, we identified a mechanism-based 38 inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal 39 structure of COVID-19 virus M pro in complex with this compound. Next, through a 40 combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 41 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other 42 pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of M pro . Six of these inhibit M pro with 43 IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 \u03bcM. Ebselen also exhibited promising antiviral 44 activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, 45 which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to 46 new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available. 47 48 author/funder.

The COVID-19 virus genome is comprised of ~30,000 51 nucleotides; its replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, 52 required for viral replication and transcription 3,4 . The functional polypeptides are released 53 from the polyproteins by extensive proteolytic processing, predominantly by a 33.8-kDa 54 main protease (M pro ), also referred to as the 3C-like protease. M pro digests the polyprotein 55 at no less than 11 conserved sites, starting with the autolytic cleavage of this enzyme itself 56 from pp1a and pp1ab 8 . The functional importance of M pro in the viral life cycle, together 57 with the absence of closely related homologues in humans, identify the M pro as an attractive 58 target for antiviral drug design 9 . 59 To facilitate the rapid discovery of antiviral compounds with clinical potential, we 60 developed a strategy combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and 61 high-throughput screening to repurpose existing drugs to target COVID-19 virus M pro . 62 Establishing a high-throughput activity assay 63 Recombinant COVID-19 virus M pro with native N and C termini was expressed in 64 Escherichia coli and subsequently purified (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). The molecular 65 weight of COVID-19 virus M pro as determined by mass spectroscopy is 33797.0 Da, 66 consistent with its theoretical molecular weight 33796.8 Da. In order to characterize its 67 enzymatic activity and to carry out high-throughput screening of inhibitors, we developed 68 a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. To do this, a fluorescently labeled 69 substrate, MCA-AVLQ\u2193SGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2, derived from the N-terminal auto-70 cleavage sequence of the viral protease was designed and synthesized for time-dependent",

The electron density 112 shows that the S\u03b3 atom of C145-A forms a covalent bond (1.8-\u00c5) with the C\u03b2 of the vinyl 113 group, confirming that the Michael addition has occurred. The S1 subsite has an absolute 114 requirement for Gln at the P1 position. The side chains of F140-A, N142-A, E166-A, H163-115 A, H172-A, S1-B (from protomer B), and main chains of F140-A and L141-A are involved 116 in S1 subsite formation, which also includes two ordered water molecules (named W1 and W2). The lactam at P1 inserts into the S1 subsite and forms a hydrogen bond with H163-118 A. The side chain of Leu at P2 site inserts deeply into the hydrophobic S2 subsite, which 119 consists of the side chains of H41-A, M49-A, Y54-A, M165-A, and the alkyl portion of the 120 side chain of D187-A. The side chain of Val at P3 is solvent-exposed, indicating that this the S1\u2032 site, forming van der Waals interactions with T24-A and T25-A. In addition, N3 126 forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues in the substrate-binding 127 pocket, which also helps lock the inhibitor inside the substrate-binding pocket. conformation. This may be attributed to an ordered water (W1) in SARS-CoV M pro -N1 133 structure, which makes a long-distance hydrogen bond to the carboxylate oxygen of the 134 ester and also forms two hydrogen bonds from the backbone NH of G143 and the side 135 chain of N142. In our previous study, we proposed that all the CoV M pro s share a highly 136 conserved substrate-recognition pocket, which could serve as a drug target for the design 137 of broad-spectrum inhibitors 12 . The recent discovery of new CoVs and accumulation of 138 structural data for CoV M pro s from various species provided the opportunity to further 139 examine this hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal structures of M pro s 12-21 have shown that the most variable regions were the helical domain \u2162 and surface loops, but the 141 substrate-binding pockets located in a cleft between domains \u2160 and \u2161 are still highly 142 conserved among all CoV M pro s, suggesting the antiviral inhibitors targeting this site should 143 have wide-spectrum anti-CoV activity (Fig. 2b, c) . \u03bcM.

About 1\u00d710 4 Vero cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and incubated for 20-24 h 429 at 37 \u00b0C. All the infection experiments were performed at biosafety level-3 (BSL-3). Cells 430 were pre-treated with the drug candidates (10 \u03bcM) for 1 h; the COVID-19 virus (MOI of 431 0.01) was subsequently added to allow infection for 2 h. Then, the virus-drug mixture was 432 removed and cells were further cultured with fresh drug-containing medium. At 72 h post 433 infection (p.i.), viral RNA (vRNA) was extracted from the culture supernatant using 434 QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's 435 recommendation and detected by qRT-PCR assay using the COVID-19 virus-specific 436 primers. Because shikonin showed cellular toxicity at the test concentration, its antiviral 437 activity assay did not further proceed. Viral RNA copies per milliliter were determined 438 using a synthetic RNA fragment to amplify the target region. The linearized plasmid 439 containing S gene of COVID-19 virus was subjected to in vitro transcription. The resulting 440 RNA transcripts were purified and then quantified using spectrophotometry on Nanodrop 441 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The purified RNA was diluted 10-fold serially 442 using RNase-free water and was detected using qRT-PCR. Threshold cycle (Ct) values for 443 the known concentrations of the RNA were plotted against the log of the number of genome 444 equivalent copies. The resultant standard curve was used to determine the number of 445 genome equivalents of vRNA in the samples. The determination of the detection the tested drugs on Vero cell were determined by MTS cell proliferation 451 assays (Promega, USA). 1\u00d710 4 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and incubated for 20-452 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. After that, the medium was removed, and 100 \u00b5l of medium containing 453 decreasing concentrations of antiviral compounds were added to the wells. After 4 days 454 incubation at 37 \u00b0C, MTS assays were performed according to manufacturer's protocols. 455 All experiments were performed in triplicate.
