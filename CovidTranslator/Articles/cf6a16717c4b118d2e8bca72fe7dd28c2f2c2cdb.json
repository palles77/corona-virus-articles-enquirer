We have used the antigen-presenting T cell system to identify the viral receptor used by hepatitis B virus (HBV) to enter cells, as well as the sequence of HB envelope antigen (HBenvAg) involved in this interaction. Results show that both CD4 + and CD8 + T clones can process and present HBenvAg to class II-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes and that the CD71 transferrin receptor (TfR) is involved in efficient HBenvAg uptake by T cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that the HBenvAg sequence interacting with the T cell surface is contained within the pre-S2 region. Since TfR is also expressed on hepatocytes, it might represent a portal of cellular entry for HBV infection. This system of antigen presentation by T cells may serve as a model to study both lymphocyte receptors used by lymphocytotropic viruses and viral proteins critical to bind them.",

Lysis of presenting T cells was observed with a significantly lower concentration of antigen than that needed to induce a comparable level of EBV-B killing ( Fig. 1 ). T cell clones, selected for presenting HBenvAg, were isolated and stimulated with PHA using aUogeneic iPBL as feeders, which lacked the appropriate class II molecules, to exclude the presence of HLA-restricted conventional APC. These CD4 + and CD8 + clones were cytotoxic in a lectin-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (LDCC) assay (data not shown). In some experiments, the HBenvAg-specific CD4 + T clone, used as source of APC, was able to present HBenvAg to itself (data not shown). In this case, to exclude the presence of autologous conventional APC, the T clone was restimulated with PHA using allogeneic iPBL as feeders as described above. HBenvAg presentation by T cells required processing since cold pulsing resulted in a drastic inhibition of their APC capacity (Table 3 ). This ability was restored after at least 60 rain of incubation at 37~ except for T cells incubated in the presence of the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine (100 #M) (Sigma Chemical Co.), which inhibits the class II endosomal processing pathway (22) (Table 3 ). In contrast, recognition of 1-21 peptide, which presumably directly binds class II molecules without processing (23), was not affected by either cold or chloroquine treatments.",

The finding that HBenvAg presentation was drastically inhibited when presenting T cells were cold-pulsed argues against the possibility that denatured HBenvAg fragments directly bind MHC molecules without processing and indicates that both internalization and processing are required. These results suggest that HBenvAg uses a surface receptor to enter T cells. Our investigations support the hypothesis that TfR represents one of the membrane molecules, which play a fundamental role in HBenvAg internalization and presentation. Indeed, only the anti-TfR/CD71 (OKTg), from a large series of randomly selected mAbs, was able to inhibit killing of both CD4 + and CD8 \u00a7 T cells by specific class II-restricted CTL when added before and not after antigen pulsing. This suggests that OKT9 was the only mAb blocking the HBenvAg capture by T cells. OKT9 also inhibited antigen uptake by EBV-B cells, but to a lesser degree than that observed with T cells, thereby suggesting that HBenvAg may in part use the CD71 receptor to enter B lymphocytes. However, B lymphocytes may also capture the HBenvAg either aspecificaUy (27) or through interaction with other membrane structures. The anti-TfR mAb selectively interfered with HBenvAg uptake by APC, since it did not inhibit the presentation of either the 1-21 peptide (which does not need processing) or the unrelated TT antigen. Conversely, the aspecific interactions between APC and T cells, rather than the initial HBenvAg uptake, were inhibited by adhesion molecule mAbs (24) . They indiscriminately inhibited specific lysis when added before or after antigen pulsing of APC. These mAbs also blocked presentation of both the 1-21 peptide and unrelated TT antigen.",

In agreement with these findings, we found that OKT9 does not inhibit Tfbinding to its receptors, but downregulates surface Till on T cells when incubated at 37~ This is followed by a decrease of iodinated Tf and HBenvAg bindings, confirming that this mAb blocked HBenvAg presentation by interfering with its internalization (data not shown).",

            "text": "The involvement of TfK in HBenvAg interaction with lyre-phocytes is also supported by binding experiments. In this regard, HBenvAg only partially inhibits Tf binding. Furthermore, among the anti-CD71 mAbs inhibiting the binding of Tf to its receptor, only one (43/31 mAb) markedly decreases iodinated HBenvAg binding to the cells. This clearly suggests that the epitope involved in the interaction between HBenvAg and Tf receptor is similar but not identical to that involved in the binding of Tf. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study indicating that TfR may be involved in the binding of a ligand different from Tf. We evaluated whether the system of antigen presentation by T cells could also be used for identification of the sequence relevant for HBenvAg interaction with T cells. Our results dearly indicate that this sequence mapped to the pre-S2 region, based on the ability of T cells to present both the entire (pre-S1, pre-S2, S) protein and the protein containing pre-S2/S regions without pre-S1 to a S-specific T clone (VB27), and on their failure to present the S protein alone to the same clone. Moreover, the finding that T cells presented the r(S,L) protein, containing the only 133-145 sequence of pre-S2 region, to lesser extent than r(pre-S2, S) containing the entire pre-S2, suggests that HBenvAg epitope binding to T cells overlaps the 133-145 pre-S2 peptide. Comparative analysis of the capacity of different HBenvAg molecular constructs to inhibit \"If binding provided evidence strictly in line with results derived from antigen-presentation studies, i.e., the HBenvAg sequence interacting with TfR on T cells is contained in the pre-S2 region. More precise mapping of this epitope may be useful for the design of innovative synthetic vaccines. Studies on T and B cell recognition of pre-S2 epitopes suggest that the 120-132 and 132-149 peptides are particularly crucial for virus neutralization (26, 34, 35) . Moreover, the pre-S2 domain, as well as the pre-S1 region, have been proposed to be involved in attachment of HBV to hepatocytes and to other cells that are susceptible to infection (26) .",

In our hands, CD4 + CTL did not elicit bystander lysis, indicating that they killed by a direct target/CTL contact mechanism, and not aspecifically by secreted soluble cytotoxic mediators (25, 43) . The finding that CD4 + CTL are able to lyse both CD4* and CD8 + CTL clones in a HLA-restricted manner are in contrast with reports suggesting that CTL are resistant to self-mediated lysis (44) . These studies used murine CTL instead of human CD4 + CTL, utilized in the present study, thus, possibly explaining this discrepancy (6) . Experiments with human class II-restricted CTL, specific for the HIV gp120, indicated that lysis of gp120-presenting CD4 + T cells represent an immunosuppression mechanism (10, 37) . Analogously, class II-restricted CTL specific for HBenvAg can lyse themselves or other HBenvAg-presenting CD4 + or CD8 + T cells, thereby downregnlating the T cell response and posing a selective advantage for HBV persistence (45) .",

Target EBV-B cells were washed and cultured with the autologous B41 T clone for CTL assay. Cytotoxicities of the B41 T clone and the TT-specilic T line against the respective antigen-pulsed target EBV-B cells without mAbs treatment were 79% and 40%, respectively. Values expressing percent inhibition >50% are underlined. Percent specific lysis is expressed as mean of triplicate determinations. The results represent the mean values of four experiments.",
