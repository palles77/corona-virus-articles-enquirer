Prions are infectious agents that do not possess a genome and the pathogenic protein was not thought to evoke any immune response. Although we previously reported that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, suggesting the protective role of host innate immune responses mediated by IRF3 signalling, this remained to be clarified. Here, we investigated the reciprocal interactions of type I interferon evoked by IRF3 activation and prion infection and found that infecting prions cause the suppression of endogenous interferon expression. Conversely, treatment with recombinant interferons in an ex vivo model was able to inhibit prion infection. In addition, cells and mice deficient in type I interferon receptor (subunit interferon alpha/beta receptor 1), exhibited higher susceptibility to 22L-prion infection. Moreover, in in vivo and ex vivo prion-infected models, treatment with RO8191, a selective type I interferon receptor agonist, inhibited prion invasion and prolonged the survival period of infected mice. Taken together, these data indicated that the interferon signalling interferes with prion propagation and some interferon-stimulated genes might play protective roles in the brain. These findings may allow for the development of new strategies to combat fatal diseases.",

Prions are proteinaceous infectious pathogens distinct from bacteria or viruses. Accumulation of the structurally abnormal prion protein (PrP Sc ) causes pathological changes such as neuronal death in the brain, resulting in rapidly progressive cognitive disorders. PrP Sc , which is highly enriched in b-sheet secondary structures, causes misfolding of normal cellular PrP (PrP C ) (Prusiner, 1998; Weissmann et al., 2002) . In a widely-accepted model of the molecular mechanism of prion pathogenesis, following the expression or introduction of PrP Sc , the pathogenic proteins accumulate in and on neurons; subsequently, various inflammatory responses occur and induce neuronal death (Tamguney et al., 2008; Aguzzi et al., 2013) . One pathological feature associated with prion infection is widespread diffuse gliosis. However, the host-pathogen interaction in these diseases remains incompletely understood.",

Because the amino acid sequence of PrP Sc is identical to that of PrP C , which is encoded by a host gene, the host immune system was initially thought not to recognize the prion pathogen (Aguzzi and Polymenidou, 2004) . However, accumulated evidence has shown that prion infection stimulates pattern recognition receptor (PRR)related molecules and related signalling pathways, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), and some cytokines (Prinz et al., 2003; Spinner et al., 2008; Bradford and Mabbott, 2012; Ishibashi et al., 2012a; Nuvolone et al., 2015; Kang et al., 2016) . We have also reported that IRF3, which upregulates type I interferon (I-IFN) in various cell types, including neurons, plays a role in host defence against prion infection (Ishibashi et al., 2012a, b) , and that persistent prion infection negatively regulates IRF3 via suppression of the transcription factor Octamer-binding protein-1 (Oct-1) (Homma et al., 2014a) . Prions also exhibit strain diversity and reciprocal interference between strains, analogous to viral infections (Dickinson et al., 1972 (Dickinson et al., , 1975 Manuelidis, 1998) . In addition, the levels of interferon-stimulated genes with anti-viral functions, including myxovirus resistance protein, protein kinase R, and 2 0 -5 0 oligoadenylate synthetase, are significantly elevated at the clinical stage of prion disease in animal models (Riemer et al., 2000; Baker et al., 2004; Xiang et al., 2004; Stobart et al., 2007) , suggesting that innate immunity protects the host, at least partially, against prion infection. In this study, we focused on the relationship between I-IFN and prion disease and sought to determine which interferon-stimulated gene induced by I-IFN signalling plays a direct protective role against prion invasion.",

Hence, we investigated the potential anti-prion effect of recombinant I-IFNs (IFN-and -b) in cell culture models. In the primary prion-challenge test IFN-b treatment significantly suppressed PrP Sc levels in persistently 22 L-prion-infected cells, and pretreated cells became resistant to 22 L-prion primary infection in a dose-dependent manner; the effect of IFN-at similar doses was weaker ( Fig. 2A  and B ). Similar resistance to prion was also observed in IFN-b-overexpressing stable cell lines (58-IFN-b) ( Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. 2A) . Transient IFN-b expression did not reduce endogenous PrP Sc levels in persistently 22 L prion-infected cells (Supplementary Fig. 2C ). Pre-transfection of cells with Poly I:C, which activates the innate immune system via I-IFN induction, prevented the establishment of prion infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D) . To evaluate efficacy of IFN-b against prion propagation in prion infectious animal model, we performed bioassay using 22 L-prion-infected Tga20 mice with lentivirus coding Ifnb gene (LV-IFN). Lentiviral vectors were administered at 3 weeks after prion infection. LV-IFN localized in thalamus at 20 days after stereotaxic injection into Tga20 mice brain (Fig. 2E ). When lentivirus carrying the mouse Ifnb gene (LV-IFN) was injected intracerebrally, PrP Sc levels were significantly reduced at the terminal stage in the brain of Tga20 mice after prion inoculation (Fig. 2F) . In pathological analysis, vacuolation and PrP Sc deposits decreased significantly in the brains of LV-IFN-treated mice ( Supplementary Fig. 2B ). The endogenous PrP C level did not change in response to IFN-b overexpression in N2a-58 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 2D ), indicating that IFNb might prevent new PrP Sc production at the early phase of primary prion infection without affecting PrP C expression.",

            "text": "To confirm that the suppression of prion infection by IFNs was associated with IFN signalling, we generated immortalized MEF cells from wild-type and IFNAR1-deficient (Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) mice and performed prion infection ex vivo. Susceptibility to 22 L prion infection was remarkably higher in immortalized MEF cells from Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice than in MEF cells from wildtype mice. Prions were dose-dependently propagated in both MEF cells. IFNAR1 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs showed significantly higher sensitivity to prion infection with 1.5 \u00c2 10 \u00c01 % 22 L-brain homogenate than MEFs from wild-type (Fig. 3A) . Next, we generated Ifnar1-transduced Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEF cells, which were rescued by delivering the Ifnar1 gene to Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs with an MSCV retroviral vector, and investigated the efficiency of prion infection in an ex vivo model. The PrP C level was similar between Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs and Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs rescued by delivering the Ifnar1 gene with an MSCV retroviral vector, but the latter cells were significantly and continuously less susceptible to 22 L prion infection (Fig. 3B,  Supplementary Fig. 3A and B) . To confirm whether the transduction restored IFN signalling, we performed ISRE-promoter activity analysis using the dual luciferase assay. The results indicated that the promoter activity in Ifnar1-transduced Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs after poly I:C stimulation was significantly increased (3-fold) compared with non-stimulated cells, indicating that the transduced cells recovered cell signalling function via IFNAR1 whereas Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 MEFs did not possess this signalling pathway (Supplementary Fig. 3C ). To elucidate the relationship between I-IFN dependent signalling pathways and prion infection in vivo, we inoculated 22 L prion into wild-type and Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and monitored prion pathogenesis. When mice were challenged intracerebrally with a 10 \u00c01 dilution of 22 L prion brain homogenate, the survival periods of Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were significantly shorter (145 AE 5 days, n = 15; P = 0.0006, Log-rank test) than those of the wildtype mice (153 AE 8 days, n = 17) ( Fig. 4A and Table 1) . Furthermore, all groups of IFNAR1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice inoculated with 10 \u00c02 dilution i.c., or 10 \u00c02 and 10 \u00c03 dilution i.p., also exhibited significantly shortened survival (Table 1) . To confirm pathogenesis in IFNAR1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice after prion inoculation, we performed immunoblotting to examine the PrP Sc levels in the brain and spleen at 100 dpi and at the terminal stage. The PrP Sc levels in the brain and spleen of Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were similar into those of wild-type mice ( Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 3D ). However, vacuolation and gliosis with microglia (marker: IBA1) and astrocytes (marker: GFAP) were significantly more severe than in wild-type mice. In addition, accumulation of PrP Sc in some regions at 100 dpi was considerably more severe in Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Fig.  4C, D and Supplementary Fig. 3E ). Taken together, these findings indicate that the I-IFN signalling pathway via I-IFN receptor, including IFNAR1, protects to some degree against prion infection. and NIH3T3 (C) cells after ex vivo prion infection with 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 or 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 % 22 L-brain homogenate (BH).

The reported functional mechanism of RO8191 is selective binding to the I-IFN receptor and the sequential induction of many interferon-stimulated genes, followed by the activation of I-IFN signalling (Tga20) inducing Ifnb with lentivirus system. Panels show localization of lentivirus in thalamus 20 days after stereotaxic injection to Tga20 mice brain (Venus: green; nuclei: blue) (E). Scale bar = 50 mm. PrP Sc levels in brain of 22 Lprion-infected mice in the terminal stage brain pre-injected stereotaxically (s.t.) and intracerebrally (i.c.) with LV-venus and -IFN (F). Graphs show quantifications of PrP Sc band intensities in brain (n = 3 mice per each lentiviral injection group). Statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student's t-test (C and F) and one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's test in multiple comparisons (A, B and D). *P 5 0.05, **P 5 0.01 and ***P 5 0.001. Data are presented as mean AE SEM. Western blot results represent at least three independent experiments. (Konishi et al., 2012) . To determine whether IFN-dependent signalling mediated I-IFN receptor-regulated prion infection, we investigated PrP Sc levels in persistently prion-infected cells after RO8191 treatment for 48 h. PrP Sc levels in N2a-22 L cells treated with RO8191 were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner (0.5, 5, 50, 250 and 500 mM RO8191) (Fig. 5A) . However, PrP C levels in N2a-58 cells treated with RO8191 showed no change (Fig. 5B) . In both cells, the level of 2 0 -5 0 oligoadenylate synthetase 1a (OAS1a), encoded by an interferon-stimulated gene, was dose-dependently increased by RO8191 treatment. Moreover, we investigated the potential anti-prion effect of RO8191 in cell culture models. RO8191 pretreated cells became resistant to 22 L-prion primary infection with the increase in expression of OAS1a in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C) , suggesting that RO8191, which induces interferon-stimulated genes via I-IFN signalling during the innate immune response, might prevent the establishment of prion infection without affecting PrP C expression. Next, to evaluate the efficacy of RO8191 against prion propagation in a prion infectious animal model, we performed a bioassay using prion-infected mice. The ddY mice intracerebrally inoculated with 10% 22 L prion brain homogenate were intraperitoneally administered 2 mg/kg/day RO8191 three times a week from 2 days post-inoculation until sacrifice. The survival periods of RO8191-treated mice were significantly longer (165 AE 7 days, n = 8; P = 0.0123, Log-rank test) than those of the vehicle mice (156 AE 4 days, n = 7) (Fig. 6A) . Changes in the body weight of each group were consistent with prolonged survival times. The changes in body weight of the RO8191 group gently decreased compared with those of vehicle group, and this was delayed by about 2 weeks. RO8191-treated mice were observed for toxicity due to chronic administration and the symptoms of prion disease were similar to those of the vehicle mice ( Supplementary Fig. 4A ). We analysed PrP Sc and histological changes in the brains of mice at 100 dpi, which was the time point before disease onset. PrP Sc levels in the RO8191-treated brains and spleens were significantly less (50% reduction) than in the vehicle-treated brains at 100 dpi. PrP Sc suppression in the spleens of RO8191-treated mice was observed until the terminal stage (Fig. 6B ). RO8191 treatment significantly inhibited the levels of vacuolation and PrP Sc deposition in some regions, including the cortex and spleen, compared with vehicle treatment at 100 dpi. Likewise, we also evaluated gliosis levels in the brains of RO8191-treated mice at 100 dpi. At 100 dpi, RO8191 treatment significantly reduced the expression of Iba-1 and GFAP, which are markers of activated microglia and astrocytes, in multiple regions of the cortex, thalamus and pons. However, RO8191 treatment resulted in no changes in expression in any of the regions at terminal phase (Fig. 6C, D and Supplementary Fig. 4B ). These results indicate that RO8191 might have the potential to suppress prion formation in several tissues of the body following exogenous prion infection.",

Notably, Tlr3, Ddx58/ RIGI, Ifih1/MDA5 and Irf7, which are innate immune genes of the upstream signalling pathway relating to I-IFN induction, were suppressed by prion infection (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). IRF3 can contribute to the regulation of gene expression not only for Ifnb but also for Ifih1/ MDA5 (Yount et al., 2007) . TLR3 (Heinz et al., 2003) , IRF1 (Choi et al., 2009) and IRF7 (Farlik et al., 2012) are evoked by STAT1 and NFB is activated by intracellular signalling in response to IFN-b stimuli. Moreover, IRF1 is a transcription factor that positively regulates RIGI expression in human cells (Su et al., 2007) . These studies indicate that prion infection might result in a dysfunctional immune system following the suppression of the expression of several genes by IRF3 reduction because type I IFN signalling mediated by IRF3 is closely connected with the regulation of expression of several innate immunity-related genes. However, the mechanism of action has not yet been determined and needs to be investigated in the future.",

            "text": "Although we found that IFN expression remained unchanged in the brains of prion-infected mice during the terminal period, it has been reported that the expression of many interferon-stimulated genes was increased in the brains of prion-infected animals (Riemer et al., 2000; Xiang et al., 2004; Stobart et al., 2007) . Similarly, the expression of several interferon-stimulated genes was remarkably increased in the glial cells of the brains of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Baker et al., 2004) . However, it remains unclear whether IFN gene expression is increased in ex vivo and in vivo prion-infected models at an early phase. Furthermore, it has not been determined whether IFN in the host plays a protective role against prion pathogen infection. In our experiments, prion infection suppressed IFN expression in prion-infected cells (Fig. 1) and low IFN expression levels were recovered by a reduction of PrP Sc (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, pretreatment with IFN and IFN system stimuli inhibited the new establishment of prion infection (Fig. 2) , indicating that the host might combat prion propagation using any defence system available, including IFN. Thus, it will be necessary to investigate IFN induction at an early phase in neurons after prion infection. I-IFN stimulates various cell types, including immune cells such as lymphocytes, glia, and neurons (Delhaye et al., 2006; Paul et al., 2007) . Intriguingly, I-IFN is constitutively expressed at low levels even in the absence of pathogens and contributes to the regulation of tumour propagation and cell growth (Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001) . Dysfunction of TLR4 and IRF3 facilitate prion pathogenesis (Spinner et al., 2008; Ishibashi et al., 2012a) , suggesting that this process might be negatively regulated by signalling pathways, including I-IFN, that act downstream of PRRs. Pretreatment with complete Freund's adjuvant and unmethylated CpG DNA to activate TLR signalling delays clinical onset in mice after prion inoculation (Sethi et al., 2002; Tal et al., 2003) . Furthermore, glial cells pretreated with poly I:C are strongly resistant to prion infection (Kang et al., 2016) , but post-treatment does not protect against prion pathogenesis in mice (Worthington, 1972; Cunningham et al., 2005; Field et al., 2010) . Here, we showed that I-IFN signalling mediated by IFNAR1 suppressed prion pathogenesis in cell culture and mouse models after prion inoculation. Although persistent infection by 22 L prion decreased expression of innate immunity genes such as Irf3 and Ifnb in an ex vivo system (Homma et al., 2014a) , I-IFN protected against primary prion infection in cells (Fig. 2) . These findings suggest that I-IFN, induced by TLR signalling, exerts a crucial anti-prion effect in the early phase after prion infection. Tumor necrosis factor-and interleukin-6, which are induced following stimulation of PRR such as TLR4, may contribute to the acceleration of prion infection as determined by a prion bioassay using gene-deficient mice (Thackray et al., 2004; Tamguney et al., 2008) . However, the relationship between suppression and I-IFN signalling has yet to be determined.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the I-IFN pathway contributes to host defence mechanism against prion infection. Although we do not yet know exactly how host cells can recognize the prion pathogen, which lacks its own genetic material, the IFR3-IFN pathway serves as an important line of defence. Interference with this pathway permits persistent prion infection. The reciprocal interaction between innate host immunity and invading prions may explain the long latency of prion diseases. I-IFN and TLR signalling have diverse functions, including activation of autophagic systems that promote degradation of -synuclein-derived aggregations (Ejlerskov et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015) and contribute to neuronal homeostasis (Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001) . Therefore, effects of I-IFN should be considered in further investigations. Elucidating the role of host immunity in prion diseases could facilitate development of novel therapeutics for this deadly disease. ",
