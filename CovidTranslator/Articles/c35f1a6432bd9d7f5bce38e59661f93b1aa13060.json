There are five ebolavirus species; although much is known about Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) and its neutralization by antibodies, little is known about Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), which is emerging with increasing frequency. Here we describe monoclonal antibodies containing a human framework that potently inhibit infection by SUDV and protect mice from lethal challenge. The murine antibody 16F6, which binds the SUDV envelope glycoprotein (GP), served as the starting point for design. Sequence and structural alignment revealed similarities between 16F6 and YADS1, a synthetic antibody with a humanized scaffold. A focused phage library was constructed and screened to impart 16F6-like recognition properties onto the YADS1 scaffold. A panel of 17 antibodies were characterized and found to have a range of neutralization potentials against a pseudotype virus infection model. Neutralization correlated with GP binding as determined by ELISA. Two of these clones, E10 and F4, potently inhibited authentic SUDV and conferred protection and memory immunity in mice from lethal SUDV challenge. E10 and F4 were further shown to bind to the same epitope on GP as 16F6 with comparable affinities. These antibodies represent strong immunotherapeutic candidates for treatment of SUDV infection.",

Together, EBOV and SUDV have accounted for over 95% of Ebola virus-related deaths; 5 these statistics do not include the ongoing large outbreak in West Africa, which is of unprecedented scope and geographic distribution. 1,6 Many studies have been directed at understanding EBOV entry and inhibition of virus entry with antibodies and other agents; 3,4,7\u22129 however, considerably less is known about MARV and SUDV despite the increasing prevalence of these two species.",

Sequence and structural alignment of 16F6 (murine scaffold) with the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-specific synthetic antibody YADS1 (humanized scaffold) revealed marked similarity in the framework regions (Figure 1a and b). 19, 20 At the amino acid level, there is 77% identity and 87% similarity in noncomplementarity-determining region (CDR) segments, and examination of the structural alignment between the two antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) revealed strong homology of framework segments leading into the CDR loops. Superimposing the frameworks of the two Fabs and variable domains (Fvs) excluding CDR loops revealed RMSDs of 2.6 and 1.3 \u00c5 over 381 and 182 C\u03b1 atoms, respectively. Although there is marked variability in the loop conformations themselves, we surmised that appropriate positioning of the beginning and end of the CDR loops would allow productive conformations in a humanized antibody containing the 16F6 CDR segments. YADS1 shares a framework with many synthetic antibodies and is derived from the V H 3-23 germline segment that has favorable characteristics such as high expression, stability, and mutability. 20\u221222 This analysis suggested that incorporation of 16F6like recognition onto the YADS1 scaffold might provide a successful strategy for creating SUDV antibodies bearing a humanized framework that are suitable for immunotherapy.",

Restricted diversification was permitted at positions near the CDR segments that did not involve direct antigen contacts at the analogous sites in 16F6 but had differing residue identity between 16F6 and YADS1. For example, CDR-H1 position 29 (Ile in YADS1 but Phe in 16F6) was allowed to vary among the four residues Phe/Ile/Leu/Met, thus encoding both the 16F6 and YADS1 residues as well as two others (Leu and Met) with similar properties. This randomization strategy was applied to several positions in CDR-H1, H2, and H3, as well as CDR-L1 and L3. In addition, two residues in CDR-L2 (53 and 56) differed among YADS1 (Tyr and Ser, respectively) and 16F6 (both Thr), but the corresponding residues made partial contacts to the antigen in 16F6. Therefore, these two positions were diversified with an NNK (N = A/T/C/G; K = G/T) codon allowing all 20 possible amino acids. Full details for the randomization strategy are discussed in the Figure 1 caption. In total, 13 positions were randomized with a theoretical diversity 4.5 \u00d7 10 8 at the DNA level and 4 \u00d7 10 7 at the protein level; the library was produced with \u223c10 10 unique members, allowing exhaustive sampling. The library was expressed as a bivalent Fab fusion to the pIII gene as has been previously described for other synthetic antibodies. 20, 21 This bivalent display format was chosen to more accurately mimic the nature of an IgG, which would be the preferred downstream therapeutic format.",

This protein includes all major domains on GP1 and GP2 except the transmembrane domain and C-terminal tail and is mostly trimeric in solution (data not shown). Previous work has demonstrated that GP constructs expressed in mammalian cells but lacking the transmembrane segment provide a suitable mimic of the prefusion spike for antibody selection, binding, and other structural studies. 7, 8, 18, 19 Several hundred clones were screened for binding to GP SUDV from output populations of rounds 3\u22126 by monoclonal phage ELISA to identify 38 clones representing 17 unique sequences (see Supporting Information). The distribution of amino acids among these clones is represented in Figure 1c . To compare requirements for recognition and stability, a parallel selection to determine display preferences was performed against anti-FLAG antibody M2; a FLAG epitope was included at the Cterminus of the phage displayed light chain, and therefore any preferences for display will be evident with this analysis. 23, 24 Comparison of amino acid composition among ELISA-positive clones from the functional selection (GP SUDV ) and the display selection (M2) distribution revealed moderate preferences for GP SUDV recognition at many positions but strong preferences for the 16F6 residues at positions 29, 100a, and 100b of the heavy chain. Inspection of the 16F6 crystal structure suggests that F29 and F100b likely support loop conformations, as these residues are buried and participate in internal hydrophobic interactions (see Supporting Information). 19 Residue F100a participates in the structural paratope, and therefore this residue is likely critical for the intermolecular interface. In contrast, the 16F6 residue Ser at position 52a of CDR-H2 is less preferred compared with the YADS1 cognate residue Pro. This preference is more evident in clones showing stronger neutralization efficacy (below). Since Pro has a strong effect on loop conformations, the Pro at this position may serve to orient the CDR-H2 loop toward favorable GP recognition in the human framework.",

            "text": "Antibody Binding and Neutralization. The panel of 17 unique antibodies were produced as IgG1 molecules and characterized. As a preliminary screen, the mAbs were tested for their ability to inhibit infection of a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with the SUDV glycoprotein (VSV-GP SUDV ) at 20 nM and 100 nM (Figure 2a and 2b) . Murine 16F6 and the human EBOV-specific antibody KZ52 were included as positive and negative controls, respectively. 25 Overall, the humanized mAbs had a range of activity against VSV-GP SUDV , with the most potent inhibiting at levels on-par with murine 16F6 (\u223c90% inhibition at 20 nM and \u226595% at 100 nM). Notably, KZ52, an EBOV-specific human antibody, had no activity even at 100 nM, consistent with previous reports of its strain specificity. 25, 26 All 17 mAbs were also tested against VSV-GP EBOV but had no activity at 100 nM, and thus the humanized variants maintained the specificity profile of the murine 16F6 parent. This orthogonality in neutralization activity for 16F6 and its humanized counterparts (monospecific for SUDV) and KZ52 (monospecific for EBOV) is notable since the independent cocrystal structure complexes of 16F6 Fab-GP SUDV and KZ52 Fab-GP EBOV revealed that both antibodies bind at similar locations on the glycoprotein. 7, 18, 19 In fact, the structural epitopes of the two Fabs overlap by 10 residues, suggesting this region is a shared neutralization epitope among the ebolaviruses. 19 However, no broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) against the filoviruses has yet been described. As a point of comparison, bNAbs against HIV-1 gp120 and influenza HA target conserved regions, and in these cases a compact structural epitope that focuses on conserved residues is likely critical for broad potency. 27\u221229 Eleven of the clones exhibited strong neutralization potential (\u223c95% or higher) at 100 nM; among these, E10 and F4 had favorable expression yield, were well-behaved, and thus were carried forward for further studies as representative examples. Dose-dependent inhibition profiles against VSV-GP SUDV revealed IC 50 values below 10 nM (Figure 2c ). Both mAbs were tested against authentic SUDV under Biosafety level 4 (BSL4) conditions and found to neutralize with IC 50 s below 4 nM (E10) and 8 nM (F4) (Figure 2d ). When the SUDV neutralization assays were performed in the presence of 5% guinea pig complement, IC 50 s below 4 nM were observed in both cases. These results indicate that E10 and F4 have potent neutralization activity against SUDV GP-mediated cell entry. The fact that IC 50 s against SUDV were similar in the presence or absence of complement suggests that the mechanism involves binding of GP and inhibition of cell entry, but not opsonization or activation of the complement pathway. We performed competitive ELISA experiments to determine if 16F6, E10, and F4 shared a common epitope. 16F6 was biotinylated (b16F6), and then the capacity of unbiotinylated 16F6 (positive control), E10, and F4 to inhibit b16F6 binding in a dose-specific manner was evaluated. As shown in Figure 3 , all three unbiotinylated antibodies competed effectively with b16F6 with IC 50 values below 0.2 \u03bcM for 16F6 and F4 and \u223c0.6 \u03bcM for E10. These results indicate that all three antibodies share an epitope and have relatively comparable binding affinities to GP SUDV , with modestly reduced affinity in the case of E10. Since library diversification focused mostly on supporting CDR loop residues, rather than direct contact sites, it is not surprising that affinities of the humanized clones were comparable or slightly decreased relative to the murine 16F6 parent.",

The half-maximal binding titer (EC 50 ) correlated strongly with neutralization efficacy. The strong neutralizers had EC 50 s ranging from 2.1 nM to 14.8 nM against GP SUDV , while moderate neutralizers 41C6 and 31F8 bound GP SUDV but did not exhibit saturation binding even at micromolar antibody concentrations. The non-neutralizers 35E3 and 51E1 did not have appreciable binding activity. Notably, in all cases where binding activity was observed, it was specific for GP SUDV over wells containing a negative control (2% nonfat dry milk, NFDM).

Although a mouse-adapted SUDV strain has been developed, it is not lethal to immunocompetent mice. Here, the human-lethal wild-type SUDV virus was used to infect 4-week-old Type 1 interferon \u03b1/ \u03b2 receptor knockout mice (Type 1 IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 R \u2212/\u2212 ), and the ability of the mAbs to confer post-exposure protection was evaluated. The murine 16F6 and an EBOV-specific mAb (Z.6D8, ref 30) were included as controls. Mice were provided with either three doses (days \u22121 (pre-exposure), +1 and +4 (post-exposure); Figure 5a and b) or two post-exposure doses (days +1 and +4, Figure 6a and b) of 500 \u03bcg mAb via the intraperitoneal route and challenged with a target dose of 1,000 plaque forming units (pfu) of wild-type SUDV (day 0). Mice receiving the SUDV-specific mAbs (16F6, E10, and F4) showed similar levels of protection (80\u2212100% survival, Figures  5a and 6a) , whereas those mice treated with an anti-EBOV specific mAb (Z.6D8) showed little or no protection. When mice received one dose of mAb prior to viral challenge (threedose regime), no significant weight loss, which is a measure of clinical illness, was observed following challenge in the mice that received SUDV-specific antibodies, whereas the Z.6D8treated control animals exhibited significant weight loss (maximal loss of 25%) (Figure 5b) . In fact, a weight gain was observed with SUDV-specific antibody treatment, which is to be expected due to the fact that the mice were 4 weeks old when challenged and still maturing. When initiation of treatment in mice was delayed to day +1 (post-exposure twodose regime), we observed no lethality when the SUDV-specific mAbs were provided as treatment (Figure 6a ). However, with the delay in treatment, we observed a definite weight loss in the antibody-treated mice that was absent in the day \u22121 (preexposure) three-dose treatment scenario (Figure 6b ).",

Mice were 9 weeks old when they were challenged unless otherwise specified. Surviving mice from the three-dose group that received E10 and F4 mAbs had a nonstatistically significant trend of better rechallenge protection than mice receiving 16F6 (p < 0.094, Figure 5c ). As a control to demonstrate that virus injected in rechallenge studies was capable of inducing morbidity/mortality, we included a nai\u0308ve cohort of 4-week-old mice that received the anti-EBOV specific Z.6D8 antibody. As expected there was again little or no protection noted with this treatment. Weight changes were not as apparent with the rechallenged mice in general because they were 9 weeks old and thus more developed at the time of the second infection (Figures 5d and 6d) . When surviving mice from the two-dose treatment were rechallenged at 9 weeks of age, all were protected with little or no observable weight loss. During the initial challenge experiment from this two-dose post-exposure treatment group, one of the control Z.6D8 mice survived; this mouse also survived the rechallenge. To gain additional insight, a group of nai\u0308ve, untreated 9-week-old mice were also included in the rechallenge experiment in Figure 6c . SUDV was not completely lethal to 9-week mice (survival was 80%), but the animals showed clinical signs of disease such as weight loss. When compared to 9-week mice that survived the initial infection either with SUDV mAb treatment (16F6, E10, F4) or without (Z.6D8), it is apparent that the surviving mice have memory immunity and show no weight loss as a result of infection (Figure 6d) .",

            "text": "Conclusions. Here we describe the in vitro and in vivo activity of synthetic SUDV-specific antibodies containing a human framework. These mAbs show potent neutralization activity against both pseudotyped and authentic viruses and confer protection and memory immunity from infection in mice. Although therapeutic, antibody-mediated protection against SUDV in larger animals has yet to be demonstrated, the studies showing EBOV protection of NHPs, 13\u221216 in many cases following post-exposure treatments, suggest that SUDV antibody therapies should be explored and the mAbs reported herein represent viable candidates. Antibodies have advantages of favorable serum half-life and are generally well-tolerated especially if they contain human scaffolds; though there is only . Comparative binding studies of strong, modest, and poor neutralizing antibodies. ELISA binding assays for representative antibodies from the strong, modest, and poor neutralizer categories against GP SUDV and 2% NFDM. The half-maximal binding titer (EC 50 ) is provided. None of the mAbs had activity for GP EBOV ; these data are shown for E10 and F4. one FDA-approved antibody for antiviral infection (against respiratory syncytial virus, RSV), 31 a number of mAb treatments are being considered for various viral diseases. 32\u221234 The SUDV GP sequence is 56% identical to that of EBOV GP at the amino acid level but differs in a number of structural and functional aspects. The SUDV GP appears to be more dynamic, is more susceptible to proteolytic degradation, and electrostatically has more negative surface charge character than does EBOV GP. 17, 19 Given these differences, it is not surprising that antibody-mediated neutralization requirements also differ, exemplified by the fact that KZ52 and 16F6 bind to similar overall positions on the prefusion GP spikes but have strainspecific activity (KZ52 for EBOV and 16F6 for SUDV); here we report that our humanized analogues retain this strain selectivity. SUDV has been responsible for numerous recent Ebola virus outbreaks, including one of the largest (Gulu district of Uganda in 2000 with 425 reported cases and 224 deaths), and the only recorded outbreaks in 2012. Development of SUDV-specific mAbs is therefore important for both diagnostic and research purposes as well as for potential immunotherapies.",

The synthetic gene for a template for construction of the 16F6 humanization library was cloned as a bivalent Fab into phagemid for pIII display. 35 The template consisted of DNA encoding a chimera between the YADS1 framework with 16F6 CDR segments and with 16F6 residue identity at the intended positions of randomization. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to incorporate diversity elements. 36 The library DNA was electroporated into SS320 E. coli and library phage amplified according to standard protocols. 36 Library sorting was performed according to modified published protocols. 8, 35 Recombinant GP SUDV (residues 1\u2212649, with the first 32 residues comprising the signal sequence that is removed during maturation) that was expressed in HEK293 cells served as the selection target was purchased from the Protein Expression Laboratory, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. Briefly, 0.5 \u03bcg/well of GP SUDV was immobilized on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (Fisher Scientific, Nepean, ON, Canada) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 8.0 for 14\u221216 h at 4\u00b0C. Wells were blocked with 5% NFDM (1.5 h, RT). Phage pools from the 16F6 humanization library were cycled through six rounds of binding selection using the immobilized GP SUDV as a capture target and 5% NFDM as a negative control. Stringency was increased throughout the selection by decreasing the number of wells containing antigen and antigen loading concentrations with progressive rounds of selection. The output phage population from between rounds was amplified in E. coli XL1-Blue cells in 2xYT broth supplemented with 5 \u03bcg/mL tetracycline. Output phage population was added to 5 mL cultures at OD 600 of \u223c0.6 and shaken at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. M13-K07 helper phage were added (10 10 infectious units (iu)/mL), and the culture was shaken at 37\u00b0C for an additional 1 h. The 5 mL culture was transferred to a 25 mL culture of 2xYT broth supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL carbenicillin and 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin and allowed to shake at 37\u00b0C overnight (14\u221216 h) . The cells were removed by centrifugation, and the amplified phage was precipitated by the addition of 3% (w/v) NaCl and 4% (w/v) PEG 8000. The phage was pelleted by Figure 5 .
