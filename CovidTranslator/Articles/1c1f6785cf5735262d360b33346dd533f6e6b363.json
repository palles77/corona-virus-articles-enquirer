With the outbreak having already turned into the latest global pandemic, one of the key unknowns that will determine its public health impact is the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR), i.e. the number of deaths as a proportion of all persons infected with the SARS-CoV-2 novel coronavirus, the causative pathogen of COVID-19. The IFR is expected to be much lower than the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), the proportion among confirmed cases, if many SARS-CoV-2 infections with mild or no symptoms are not being ascertained [1] . A low ascertainment rate has been previously suggested, based on epidemic modelling of exported cases: between 1.8% and 14% in Wuhan [2] [3] [4] [5] , 28.4% in Italy [6] and just 0.23% in Iran [7] .",

We similarly modelled the time between case reporting and case exposure (infection with SARS-CoV-2) with a Weibull distribution with shape/scale 4.4/22.3 decreasing linearly to 2.6/12.1 (Figure 1 ).

The model assumes that cases are observed from only a fraction of the population (i.e. the ascertainment rate) that is stable over time. We further assumed that cases are isolated upon confirmation and are thus removed from the \"Infected\" pool at that time. Transition probabilities at time t between S-E, E-I and I-R are 1-exp(-\u03b2*It-1/N), 1-exp(-\u03ba) and 1exp(-\u03b3) respectively, where It-1 the total number of all infected at time t-1, N the population of Wuhan (11 million people), \u03b2 the contact rate, \u03b3 the removal rate and \u03ba the incubation rate (the inverse of the incubation period). In this model, \u03b2/\u03b3 equals the basic reproduction number R0 and (1/\u03ba + 1/2\u03b3) equals the serial interval [12] . We used non-informative Uniform(0,10) priors for \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03ba, and Uniform(0,1) for the ascertainment rate. Four sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) a model with a variable contact rate in three roughly equal periods, i.e. until the lockdown, until 10 February and until 23 February, (2) variable contact rate and an assumed 10% ascertainment rate, (3) assuming a 85% drop in contact rate after the lockdown, as recently suggested [13] , and (4) a simplified SIR model (rather than SEIR). All analyses were done with R and JAGS, using 4 chains of 20000 iterations each and another 5000 as burn-in. Model estimates are presented as posterior medians and 95% Credible Intervals (CrI).
