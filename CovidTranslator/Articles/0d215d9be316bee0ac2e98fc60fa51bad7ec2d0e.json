Owing to its limited use, the value of RT-PCR in the clinical laboratory has not been fully evaluated. During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore in 2003, RT-PCR to detect dengue viral RNA was used as a rapid diagnostic tool to differentiate dengue from SARS among patients who presented to a hospital designated to manage and quarantine SARS cases. A total of 343 results for RT-PCR and 439 results for serology were analysed and compared with the final discharge diagnosis. Our experience indicates that RT-PCR for dengue can be set up rapidly in a clinical laboratory, with very sensitive and specific results for the diagnosis of dengue, particularly in the first 5 days from onset of symptoms.",

However, laboratory confirmation is necessary, as clinical case definitions show low positive predictive values, ranging from 22% to 62% for several different combinations of symptoms (Dietz et al., 1990) . Many laboratories rely on serology as the primary diagnostic method, but antibodies may take several days to appear so initial serology is often negative (Guzman and Kouri, 2004) . Several RT-PCR protocols for dengue have been described (Chow et al., 1993; Deubel et al., 1990; Henchal et al., 1991; Lanciotti et al., 1992; Morita et al., 1991) but these are not widely used in the clinical laboratory (Guzman and Kouri, 2004) .",

As SARS and dengue fever had similar initial presenting symptoms (Peiris et al., 2003) , RT-PCR was introduced to detect dengue viral RNA as a routine test, with the results reported on the same day. The test proved invaluable because a rapid and early positive diagnosis of dengue made a diagnosis of SARS much less likely, although co-infection with the SARS coronavirus was theoretically possible. This relieved the whole health infrastructure of the need to isolate these patients and to trace their contacts, a strategy used by Singapore to control the SARS outbreak (Gopalakrishna et al., 2004) . As isolation rooms were at a premium, a confirmed diagnosis of dengue fever was helpful. Final decisions to remove patients from isolation required interpretation of all clinical and laboratory evidence.",

Three controls were included on each run: a negative control using water, a positive patient control and a control from heat-inactivated cultured dengue virus serotype-2 that was isolated in Singapore.

A high proportion of laboratories probably do not offer any nucleic acid tests (Guzman and Kouri, 2004) . The clinical and public health need for a fast, sensitive test to help distinguish cases of dengue from SARS provided the impetus for us to introduce RT-PCR to our diagnostic laboratory. Equipment, reagents, primers and protocols were borrowed or obtained to set up this RT-PCR for dengue in concert with RT-PCR for SARS coronavirus. A small group of staff was chosen and taught some basic molecular biology and the principles of the test. Careful pipetting, avoiding contamination and proper storage of materials were emphasised throughout this period. Chemical (e.g. ethidium bromide) and biological hazards were discussed at length and samples were processed at biosafety level 2 with level 3 practices. A low threshold for consultation was encouraged so that staff was well supported.",

The accuracy of the epidemiological data used to calculate the day of illness on which the sample was collected cannot be verified.

However, this diagnosis itself may have been influenced by the dengue RT-PCR result, so these encouraging specificity results should be interpreted with a little caution. The fall off in the sensitivity from 100% in early disease to 74% by day 6 is disappointing but expected because the viraemia disappears around days 5 to 7 (Innis et al., 1989; Summers et al., 1984; Vaughn et al., 1997) .

This is probably due to the degradation of limited viable viral particles in the serum samples. This explanation is supported by the finding of a statistically significant difference in mean duration from onset of illness between the virus isolation positive and negative samples. Those RT-PCR positive but virus isolation negative samples were taken, on average, a day later than those that were positive by both methods. This could have resulted in a lower viraemia level in the sera that were negative by virus isolation. Whilst it was intended that samples were separated quickly and refrigerated or frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C while processing was awaited, the realities of a routine diagnostic laboratory dictate that samples may be left lying around pending attention. This was particularly so during the SARS outbreak as microbiological investigation was routine for all patients admitted to our hospital. In addition, the large workload delayed the transfer of samples for virus isolation, some by almost up to a year. Together, these factors could have contributed to the low virus isolation rate.",

It is possible but expensive, so we applied the same standards to this RT-PCR system as we do to other test methods and did not do it.

The product insert claims sensitivities at admission and discharge, respectively, of 88% and 94% for secondary dengue and 76% and 100% for primary dengue, although the day of illness is not given. These data are from studies in Thailand where patients may present later in disease. Two samples yielded false positive results according to the discharge diagnosis: one of them, drawn on day 2 of illness, was still IgM positive when the same sample was re-tested, although it was negative by PCR. The patient had a thrombocytopenia of 97 \u00d7 10 9 /l. Two other patients with positive serology samples were reported negative on second samples, although both patients were RT-PCR positive. Re-testing the second serology sample showed one to be positive and the other negative.
