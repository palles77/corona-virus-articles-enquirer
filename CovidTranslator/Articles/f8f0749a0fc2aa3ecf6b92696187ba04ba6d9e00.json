Exacerbating this is China's unequal distribution of wealth, with development in the inland provinces lagging far behind the coastal regions, and cities facing unprecedented growth as workers migrate from rural areas in search of jobs, resulting in considerable inequities. This rapid transformation presents the Chinese government with a significant challenge in delivering equitable healthcare to its citizens, particularly the 10% living in poverty 3 (https://www.cia.gov/ library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ ch.html).",

For example, CapitalBio and SinoGenoMax each share campuses, equipment and human resources with the National Engineering Center (Beijing) and National Human Genomics Center (Beijing), respectively.

Yet raising startup capital for innovative research-driven Chinese biotech companies is an enormous challenge-a reflection more of financial issues than a lack of confidence in the science and management. Small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in China have little access to capital when they are first starting out because banks generally turn down their loan applications 15 . This scenario improved for SMEs in January 2003 when the 'Law on the Promotion of SMEs' came into effect and again in February 2005 when the State Council issued the 'Opinions on Encouraging, Supporting and Guiding the Development of SMEs' . These opinions-also known as the 36 Regulations-provide guidance in seven key areas, including market access and financing. As a result, many Chinese commercial banks began to set up special services to help SMEs overcome capital shortages. In addition, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Small & Medium Enterprise Board opened in 2005, China also has strict restrictions on the exportation of capital, a hurdle that investors usually get around by forming an international holding company to hold title to the Chinese assets. The holding company can then seek a listing on an international exchange, giving investors an exit to repatriate their investments. Chinese regulators have recently clamped down on this strategy. When investors have few options to sell their shares and take back their investment dollars in the local stock exchanges, or exit their investments through other mechanisms, they are forced to focus on investments that will have realizable gains over a shorter time period. This ultimately hurts investments in health biotech startups, which are inherently risky ventures with long timelines to profitability.",

Often, provincial and local governments will provide additional financial or other support (e.g., tax incentives or real estate space) to projects already funded by state grants, or vice versa. For example, local funding may help a small company fund its early-stage R&D projects, whereas larger state research grants may come in only after these projects have progressed to the commercialization stage. Nearly all the companies studied here received some form of government funding, including FusoGen (from the Tianjin government) and Beike Biotech (from the Shenzhen government) ( Table 6) .

Yet, the government has not followed the sage advice of Xian-Ping Lu, president of Shenzhen Chipscreen Biosciences, who states that \"the most important thing for any nation-particularly developing nations-is to identify the mechanism of financing to support the innovative economy.\" Therefore, despite the fact that the Chinese government is investing millions of renminbi (RMB) to support an innovative industry and attract entrepreneurs to commercialize novel health-biotech products, potential investors are deterred from making substantial investments by the lack of exit strategies and the uncertainty of the financial system. Although the companies presented in this study were specifically sampled primarily because of a focus on innovative health product development, the majority of Chinese biopharmaceutical companies are selling biogeneric drugs and do not invest in innovative R&D. Some of our interviewees said this is because these companies lack the technological capabilities to develop an innovative drug or they have limited access to the financial resources to do so. The lack of favorable conditions to support an innovative biotech sector may be actively discouraging its growth, and, in fact, it appears that very few firms are investing in drug discovery. Some of the firms that are pursuing innovative R&D have incorporated hybrid business models, first, to fund the firm's survival through contract services or noninnovative products and then to fund R&D activities. Such hybrid models, however, can dilute resources and have paradoxically fallen out of favor in the West, as a well-defined targeted strategy is preferred by venture capitalists over a mix of models that mitigate commercial risk. As price-based competition among domestic manufacturers continues to put pressure on profit margins, even fewer firms may be able to support in-house R&D programs.",

In 2006, the Chinese government allocated ~$390 million to fund research on HBV and related diseases 24 . The fact that the prevalence of HBV is so high in China and it is known as a 'national' disease motivates Chinese scientists and firms to develop new treatments to address this significant need. Of the firms interviewed for this study, Fudan-Yueda Bio-Tech, and Shanghai Genomics are currently developing HBV therapeutics.

Although the Chinese government does have an immunization program that provides essential vaccinations to all Chinese citizens with vaccines that include HBV, Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) against tuberculosis, oral polio, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DPT), diphtheria-tetanus (DT) and measles, it has not put HEV or HAV vaccines on this list 25 .",

Thus, in addition to the research dollars and incentives that the Chinese government has devised to 'push' domestic innovation to develop novel products that address local health needs, additional government-sponsored incentives and procurement programs are needed to ensure that innovative products reach their intended end users. Looking at the genesis and prospects of the Chinese biotech industry, it is reasonable to expect that products will be developed in concert with the evolving mechanisms of health services.

Currently, Chinese government statistics place the country's HIV prevalence rate at 0.1% 3 (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/ the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html). There is international concern that in the years to come HIV/AIDS will develop into an epidemic in China, as it has in other parts of the world. Thus, affordable products developed for the Chinese market can also have significant impacts in other developing countries. For example, Bio-Bridge Science is developing an HIV vaccine based on a novel orally delivered papilloma pseudovirus vector and FusoGen Pharmaceuticals is developing a novel HIV fusion inhibitor intended for Chinese markets. Both companies realize that to address the local market, their products must be affordable. FusoGen's chairman, Jason Genfa Zhou, puts it this way, \"if this drug [is] too expensive, [then it's] only good for a very few people.\" However, despite the intentions of these and other Chinese companies to make their products available to other developing countries, very few have actually engaged global health organizations or developed international strategies.",

At the same time, Chinese companies clearly need the help of global health organizations to increase global access to their products. Shanghai United Cell Biotech, for example, manufactures and markets the only capsule formulation of an oral cholera vaccine available worldwide and is currently marketing the product predominantly to the niche travelers' market. Although the small company is very keen to make this product available in cholera-endemic developing countries, it is difficult to do so with its limited resources. Not only would Shanghai United Cell Biotech require a partner to provide financial assistance to carry out additional clinical trials (if they were required to adhere to international standards), but they would also need introductions to the proper decision makers in each country that they would hope to enter. According to the company's executive deputy general manager, Lee Ker Yin, \"We need to seek the WHO [World Health Organization] to help reach [the developing world]. In turn, we can help Africa.\" Lee and others feel that both the WHO and UNICEF are unaware of China's capabilities in innovative health product development, and they hope that the SFDA will engage these groups and initiate a dialog with the broader international community.",

China's financial environment and the domestic capital markets in particular, however, have requirements that differ from the more liquid markets in the West and Japan. For example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (geared to blue-chip companies; http:// www.sse.com.cn/) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Small & Medium Enterprise Board (geared to high-tech companies; http://www. szse.cn/) require a minimum of 15-25% of shares to be listed publicly, depending on the size of the company. These and other regulations (according to the Securities Law of the People's Republic of China and the Company Law of the People's Republic of China regarding the listings of shares) are designed to safeguard investors, but ultimately represent high hurdles to investors relative to other international exchanges. As a result, Chinese biopharmaceutical firms have looked to raise funds from public investors outside of China, with several recent highprofile IPOs on international exchanges, including the listings of WuXi Pharmatech (NYSE: WX) and Simcere Pharmaceutical Group (NYSE:SCR) on the New York Stock Exchange, and of 3Sbio (NASDAQ:SSRX) and China Medical Technologies (NASDAQ: CMED) on Nasdaq.",
