Then we designed amino-isonucleoside (isoA 1 , isoA 2 and isoT 1 ) incorporated siRNA 2-7. Some meaningful results have been obtained from the physicochemical property experiments in ASONs. In RNAi potency experiments, we investigated RNAi potency of each strand of the siRNA. These amino-isonucleosides incorporated siRNAs showed promising bioactivity properties and had position specificity.

Both ASONs and siRNAs take action by hybridizing to mRNA targets by Watson-Crick base pairing and inhibit translation of mRNA in a sequence-specific manner [2, 4] . Native oligonucleotide shows low enzymatic stability and cellular permeability [5, 6] . There are many problems associated with the effective use of siRNA for in vivo application, such as off-target effects, cytotoxicity, and poor pharmacokinetic properties [7] . Chemical synthesis of siRNA using phosphoramidite building blocks to produce singlestranded oligonucleotides followed by annealing to form duplexes is a generally accepted approach in this research [8] . This approach permits incorporation of a wide variety of natural and artificial modifications into the siRNA that can help solve some of the problems associated with administration of synthetic nucleic acids into cells or animals [9] .",

In our previous reports regarding the synthesis and incorporation of isonucleosides into antisense oligonucleotides, we found that modification of the terminal group confers strong nuclease resistance, while modification in the central region of the antisense oligonucleotide with L-isonucleoside enables it to become good substrates of RNase H [15] . Introduction of an amino group into the isonucleoside may form a Zwitterionic molecule, and increase the thermal stability of the isonucleoside-modified oligonucleotide with its complementary sequence. This is because in the physio-logical conditions, the positively charged amino moiety should interact with the negatively charged phosphate backbone more strongly than the uncharged hydroxyl group [16] . To be used as a probe, the amino group can also be attached with a fluorescent group such as pyrene to monitor RNA folding [17] . We had reported the amino-isonucleoside isoA 1 (Figure 1 ) incorporated siRNA (related to 3\u2032 end of the coding sequence of the wee1 mRNA), and found that amino-isonucleoside modification at the 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 terminal of sense strand showed less effects on RNA duplex thermal and serum stabilities, and their functional activities are also comparable to their native siRNAs. However, the modification on the antisense strand at the corresponding positions showed a dramatic negative RNAi potency [18] .",

Upon incorporating more than one isonucleosides on the same oligonucleotides strand, the formation of duplex would be blocked by the tortuosity of L-isonucleoside. For this reason, we incorporate only one amino-isonucleoside at a time in this study. Modifications of the sense strand were reported to be tolerated and the cleavage site (10-11th) and seed region (2nd-8th) of antisense strand have been proved to be important for the retainment of siRNA silence activity. Considering the importance of the middle site and the two terminals for the oligonucleotides, we design the aminoisonucleoside modified antisense oligonucleotides II-VII and amino-isonucleoside modified siRNAs 2-7. We analyzed the physicochemical properties of such modifications at different positions of ASONs and further investigated the RNAi potency of each strand of the modified siRNAs (related to cyclin B1-complexed CDC2). These results will be useful in the choice of modified strategies.",

The results revealed that all oligomers II-VII succeeded in hybridizing with VIII to form stable duplexes. When isoA 1 and isoA 2 were incorporated in the center of oligomers (IV and VI), the T m values were decreased by 5.8 and 7.9 \u00b0C, respectively, when compared with their natural counterpart. When isoA 1 and isoA 2 were appended to the 3\u2032-end of oligomers (III and VII), the T m values were decreased by 3.9 and 5.0 \u00b0C, respectively. When isoA 1 and isoA 2 were appended to the 5'-end of oligomers (II and V), the T m values were decreased by 3.9 and 4.9 \u00b0C, respectively. The reason of such thermal stability decreasing is that the formation of Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding was perturbed by the torsion of the backbone at the position of modification. Also, the thermal stability results of the duplexes involving isoA 1 and isoA 2 with complementary RNA IX are shown in Table 3 , demonstrating that the T m values of the modified ones were decreasing when compared with their natural counterpart. Especially, the isoA 2 incorporated ones (V, VI, and VII) show less influence than the isoA 1 incorporated ones (II, III and IV). But this trend was not obvious in the DNA/DNA duplex. The structure of DNA/RNA duplex (T m = 76.0 \u00b0C) is more compact than the DNA/DNA (68.0 \u00b0C) because of the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group of RNA. The difference between isoA 1 and isoA 2 modification may be due to the release of the torsion strain of duplex in the long side chain of amide in isoA 2 . ",

Compared to VII/IX, the hydrogen bonding was broken at the position of isonucleoside in V/IX, VI/IX. This could be the reason why V/IX and VI/IX have a higher free energy than VII/IX, although their T m values are the same, as perhaps the amide at the 6-position of the sugar ring in isoA 2 is involved in the formation of the hydrogen bonding at the position of isonucleoside. This may be due to the self regulation that releases torsion strain of duplex.",

            "text": "To evaluate the influences on the gene silencing efficiencies of both strands of amino-isonucleoside modified siRNA, two mRNA targets were constructed for the both strands of siCdc2 via siQuant vector, respectively. Each strand of siCdc2 is considerably active toward its target mRNA in the artificial RNAi assay model, in which an mRNA fragment, perfectly matching the A strand or B strand of siCdc2, was fused in-frame with the firefly luciferase gene in a mammalian expression vector [19] . The resulting fusion reporter was then used as an artificial target. The siCdc2 (siRNA-1) and siRNA-2-siRNA-7 were examined for their silencing efficacy on the two targets (Figures 6 and 7) . We have reported the synthesis of isoA 1 incorporated siRNA, and found that modification on the sense strand retained the silence efficiencies of the siRNA(Wee1) antisense strand [18] . Additionally, the conformation of an ASON was changed at the position of amino-isonucleotide incorporated, which would make the modified ASON less recognized by nucleases and increase its stability toward various enzymes. The thermal stability of modified siCdc-2 duplex with amino-isonucleoside decreased with lower T m values. Alternations in torsion angles could promote the passenger strand cleavage or separation from RISC, which could potentially increase silencing efficiency [18] . Here we continued to investigate the RNAi potency of amino-isonucleosides isoA 1 , isoA 2 and isoT 1 incorporated in the middle or 3\u2032-end of siRNA A strand or B strand. It's known that each strand of the siRNA can be the guide strand, which is loaded into RISC and executes the knockdown effect for the target itself. The gene silencing results of A strand will represent the off-target effect by sense strand loading into RISC, and the gene silencing results of B strand will represent real RNAi potency of siCdc-2. So the artificial assay system is used to investigate this phenomenon.",

While the former had no influence, the latter slightly increased the silence efficiency of B strand. As shown in the Figure 6 the siRNA-3 B-strand potency increased slightly. While in the Figure 7 , the siRNA-3 A strand has no activity. We could image that both strands of siRNA can be loaded into RISC, so there is competition effect between them. Decreasing the activity of one strand may increase the other one. As previously reported, modification incorporated in the middle of A strand will inactivate the siRNA (RNA-4, 5, 6, 7) [20] . In the process of Ago2 recognition and sense strand release or cleavage, neither of the amino-isonucleoside modifications were suitable substrates for the protein. Because the longer side chain of isoA 2 relieves torsion strain of the duplex (unpublished data), it may slightly enhance the release ability of the sense strand when compared with that of isoA 1 modification. The side chains of the amides (RNA-6, RNA-7) have less influence than the amino ones (RNA-4, RNA-5), although both amino-isonucleoside modifications decreased RNAi potency when incorporated in the middle of the B strands ( Figure 6 , Table 4 ).",

            "text": "In the previous reports, the 3\u2032-end of the sense strand modified by 2\u2032-OMe nucleosides and many others maintained the silencing efficiencies of siRNAs [21] . Our results show that the overall influence on the RNAi efficiency of modified A strand is similar to that of B strand. However, because the original RNAi potency of A strand is relatively low, the influence of modifications is more obvious [22] . When isoT 1 was incorporated in the A strand at the 18th position, its RNAi efficiency completely disappeared (RNA-3) (Figure 7 , Table 4 ). It's reported that the PAZ domain of Ago2 initially binds to the 3\u2032-end of siRNA, and once the target mRNA comes and starts to anneal to the siRNA, the 3\u2032-end of the guide strand is released from it, with the release step being the rate-limiting step in this process [23] . The amino-isonucleosides with greater stereo hindrance than the 2\u2032-OMe nucleosides incorporated near the 3'-end of the guide strand may interrupt the binding or releasing step. The possibility of difficulty in the TRBP or Dicer binding step before the formation of the RISC loading complex (RLC) cannot be eliminated, for TRBP binds 3\u2032-half of siRNA and then transfers it to Ago2 to form RLC under the help of Dicer. The steric hindrance of isonucleotides may influence protein recognition and binding process in the prior step. Combined with our previous reports [18] , it is concluded that amino-isonucleosides incorporated in the middle, 3\u2032-end or 5\u2032-end of siRNA A strand all inhibit the RNAi efficiency of this strand, which means reduction of the off-target effect by sense strand loading into RISC. Additionally, these two reporters can be treated as two independent siRNA targets with different potency. Modification in one strand merely influenced the silencing efficiency of another, which would mean the modifications didn't influence the cleavage or unwinding of the modified passenger strand of siRNA after RISC formation. In fact, it is necessary to modify more other positions of passenger strand of siRNA to give more detailed data to support the conclusion above in the future work. Both strands of siRNA can be loaded into RISC and execute knockdown effect of the corresponding target, which may be due to the competitive effect between A strand and B strand loading into RISC [24] .",
