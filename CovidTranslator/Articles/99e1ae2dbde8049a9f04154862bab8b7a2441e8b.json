Classical pathogen detection methods include bacterial (fungal) culture, microscopy and antibody testing, and PCR-based pathogen-specific nucleic acid detection. ese methods have made great progress in the diagnosis of pulmonary infectious diseases, but they have low sensitivity and poor timeliness; pathogen identification information and drug resistance information are not comprehensive, so it is impossible to identify unknown and rare pathogenic microorganisms. erefore, clinical diagnosis of pulmonary infectious diseases is very difficult.",

It combines the perception of deep learning with the decision-making ability of reinforcement learning in a common form and enables direct control from raw input to output through end-to-end learning. With the rapid development of human society, in more and more complex real-world task tasks, deep learning (DL) is needed to automatically learn the abstract representation of large-scale input data and to use this representation as a basis for self-incentive reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize problem-solving strategies. DRL is an endto-end sensing and control system with strong versatility. e learning process can be described as follows: (1) At each moment, the agent interacts with the environment to obtain a high-dimensional observation and uses the DL method to perceive the observation to obtain a specific state feature representation. (2) e value function of each action is evaluated based on the expected return, and the current state is mapped to the corresponding action through a certain strategy. (3) e environment reacts to this action and gets the next observation. By continuously cycling the above processes, the optimal strategy for achieving the goal can be finally obtained [13] . e framework of DRL is shown in Figure 1 .",

It first uses the unsupervised learning to conduct greedy pretraining on layer by layer and then supervises the whole network with supervised learning. is pretraining method provides ideal initial parameters for deep neural networks and reduces the optimization difficulty of deep neural networks [16, 17] .

In the RL field, Wilson et al. [23] used a hierarchical hybrid Bayesian model to provide prior knowledge of new tasks, enabling agents to better adapt to new task scenarios. For partially observable random multitasking scenarios, Li et al. [24] developed a regionalized policy representation to describe the behaviour of agents in different task scenarios. e method used the clustering properties contained in the Dirichlet process to share training scenarios between similar tasks and to pass valuable information between different tasks.

Compared with the traditional single-plex PCR method, it not only reduces the sample nucleic acid requirement and expands the detection range, but also has better specificity and sensitivity [11, 12] . Detection of viral pathogens mainly includes virus antigen detection, nucleic acid detection, and virus isolation and culture. However, the traditional virus pathogen detection has a low positive rate; thus, it is difficult to promote and apply in clinical practice. Second-generation sequencing technology is superior to traditional virus detection Journal of Healthcare Engineering techniques in terms of sensitivity and accuracy. It theoretically reveals all microbial information in the sample, which can detect more virus types and its positive rate is higher [35] . Detectable viruses include well-known upper respiratory tract viruses and lower respiratory tract viruses such as HSV and CMV in immunosuppressed hosts. With the increasing range of pathogens based on second-generation sequencing technology, it is found that the proportion of viruses in respiratory infections is much higher than previously thought. e applications of SGS technology to detect in-hospital-acquired viral pneumonia in real time and rapid detection have shown that SGS technology can learn evidence faster than traditional methods, so that timely measures are taken to control outbreaks of nosocomial infections.",

Sequence analysis (MLVA), etc., and the emerging high-resolution WGS technology guarantee the accurate traceability and monitoring of infectious diseases and can also complement each other with multiple molecular technologies to improve the accuracy of detection. WGS technology can track the prevalence of pathogens and more accurately identify possible sources of pathogens [40, 41] . And with the continuous development of this technology, the current traceability and monitoring capabilities for unknown pathogens are becoming more and more prominent. e pathogens of severe pulmonary infection are usually unclear. Currently, the clinical use of antigen/antibody immunology methods and traditional microbial culture techniques is used for diagnosis. However, these methods have problems of long culture period and low culture positive rate. e second-generation sequencing technology is a novel DNA/RNA sequencing method based on the detection of nucleic acid molecules, which has high sensitivity and short time-consuming, and does not depend on traditional pathogenic culture. e application of antibiotics in the early stage has little effect on the detection results. Accurate and rapid identification of microbial pathogens in patients with lung infections may result in targeted antibacterial therapies, with fewer side effects and lower costs. In particular, patients with tracheal intubation are measured by sputum extraction from the lower respiratory tract of the bronchus, which can more accurately provide pathogenic bacteria analysis of ventilator-associated pneumonia, further guiding clinical treatment and prognosis. With the development of second-generation sequencing technology, processing and sequencing time will be further reduced. e SGS method will eventually provide clinicians with rapid, accurate, independent culture-based identification of bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity characteristics [42] .",

Different from the application of SGS detection in hereditary diseases, the complex composition of infectious disease specimens and the low level of nucleic acid of pathogenic microorganisms all restrict the detection of SGS in pathogenic microorganisms of lung infection. e first problem is sensitivity. Although SGS detection shows great advantages over traditional methods in diagnosing rare and rare pathogens, the sensitivity of common pathogens such as Cryptococcus is not stronger than traditional methods. Even if these pathogens detected by traditional methods, SGS may not detect or detect only a very small number of specific fragments, which affects the results. For example, for the metagenomics detection of M. tuberculosis, the current optimal solution is still to perform SGS sequencing on the basis of MGIT960 liquid culture. e reason may be that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis are intracellular bacteria, and the current detection method is mainly to detect the intracellular infection with M. tuberculosis by using the sputum supernatant; and M. tuberculosis due to nucleic acid of GC is relatively high (60% higher), and the melting method of most bacteria cannot fully dissociate the nucleic acid strand of M. tuberculosis. erefore, under the condition of specimen processing suitable for most pathogenic microorganisms, the detection of tuberculosis cannot be effectively achieved. At present, direct SGS testing of clinical specimens to diagnose M. tuberculosis infection is very difficult.

Since SGS testing often yields a large number of backgrounds or unrelated microbial fragments, it is critical to find or identify responsible pathogens. It is first necessary to establish a knowledge database of common microorganisms for lung infections: a database of background microorganisms common to each laboratory and testing unit in SGS testing and record the number of common fragments detected. If a suspected pathogen fragment that is not in the range of common background bacteria appears in the SGS test of clinical specimens, or the number of fragments of a certain microorganism is significantly higher than the data in the background microbial database, it is included in the suspected responsible pathogen, and further methods are used for authenticating. In the alveolar lavage fluid, possible responsible bacteria, fungi, or virus fragments were detected by SGS, and the proportion of the total fragments was often extremely low, even only a few fragments, which is difficult to be diagnosed. SGS testing is often only useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary systemic infections, and when pathogens for nonclinical routine screening are detected, further use of classical pathogen detection methods is needed for diagnosis. is requires the development of a well-developed pathogen verification test system, especially for pathogenic microorganisms that are not easily detected by some common methods. Because the current SGS testing cost is still high, it cannot be widely used in the clinic, and it also affects its timeliness.
