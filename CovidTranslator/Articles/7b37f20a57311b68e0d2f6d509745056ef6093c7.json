[3] [4] [5] The Public Health Agency of Canada published the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan (CPIP, 2004) 5 based on, and in accordance with, the World Health Organization (WHO, 2005) Global Influenza Preparedness Plan, 6 which defines the responsibilities of national authorities in the event of an influenza pandemic, and provides guidelines for pandemic planning. CPIP requires that all provinces and territories develop their respective pandemic influenza contingency plans based on CPIP and WHO guidelines. Furthermore, in Canada, six provinces and three territories now have legislation requiring municipalities to file official emergency plans, although few plans were complete or available at the time of this study. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] In Canada, the provision of health services is a priority in pandemic planning. 5, 20 Emergency plans include strategies to enhance human resource pools by drawing on employee rosters, retirees, students and professionals from relevant health disciplines. However, to ensure effective implementation and adequate response capacity, these reserve HCWs must have the necessary skills and training, and they must be available and willing to work. Support mechanisms for HCWs are essential to enable them to stay healthy and perform their roles as critical personnel during disasters, while simultaneously coping with personal loss and trauma. 21 Emotional, informational and instrumental supports have a protective health effect by buffering the negative effects of stress. 22 They can be categorized according to the type of emotional, informational or instrumental aid for the recipient. 23 Many studies have explored best practices for infection control and workplace supports to protect against physical exposure to contagions. 2, 24 However, few studies have focused on formalized informational and emotional support for HCWs. The purpose of this study was to examine current emergency plans from national, provincial and municipal/regional jurisdictional levels to identify which support mechanisms have visibly been incorporated into official emergency plans.",

It was encouraging to see informational supports in several plans, as communication was cited as a key problem during the SARS outbreak, 1 and feeling informed is associated with higher confidence in infection control measures. 30 Effective communication can help alleviate fear, 31 and broader public awareness of preventive measures enables HCWs to concentrate on patient care and occupational safety. Trust, a contentious issue among HCWs, management and government authorities, 1,32 is fostered largely through careful communication. 1,2 Inadequate or inappropriate communication may foster irrational behaviour. A pertinent example occurred in the United States during the anthrax attacks in 2001, with public use of potentially ineffective or even harmful preventive antibiotics in response to inconsistent information from authorities and the media. 33 Informational supports within the plans are comprehensive, although crisis communication should begin in advance of a disaster and include long-term follow up. 34 Instrumental supports dominated the content of the plans.

High coverage levels have been achieved for the diseases originally covered by Expanded Program of Immunization, as well as for hepatitis B, rubella, mumps, and Haemophilus influenzae. The future portends new opportunities to tackle important public health priorities with new technologies, but new vaccines are much more expensive than the traditional vaccines used in childhood immunization programs. Evidence-based, informed decisions will be critical if the success of immunization programs is to be sustained. The publication is intended to assist national immunization managers and their staff, however, students of public health, medicine, and nursing; epidemiologists and disease control specialists; experts on surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases; vaccinologists; and infectologists will all likely benefit from this book.",
