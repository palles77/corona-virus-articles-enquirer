Currently, there are no vaccines or effective therapies against SFTS. In this study, a combinatorial human antibody library was constructed from the peripheral lymphocytes of 5 patients who had recovered from SFTS. The library was screened against purified virions for the production of single-chain variable-region fragments (ScFv). Of the 6 positive clones, one clone (monoclonal antibody [MAb] 4-5) showed neutralizing activity against SFTSV infection in Vero cells. MAb 4-5 was found to effectively neutralize all of the clinical isolates of SFTSV tested, which were isolated from patients in China from 2010 to 2012. MAb 4-5 was found to bind a linear epitope in the ectodomain of glycoprotein Gn. Its neutralizing activity is attributed to blockage of the interactions between the Gn protein and the cellular receptor, indicating that inhibition of virus-cell attachment is its main mechanism. These data suggest that MAb 4-5 can be used as a promising candidate molecule for immunotherapy against SFTSV infection.",

The disease is caused by a newly identified bunyavirus, SFTS virus (SFTSV) (1) , and it is characterized by sudden onset of fever, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, and a decrease in whole white blood cell and platelet counts that gradually progresses into hemorrhage and multiorgan failure at the end stage (2) . This disease has been reported across a broad geographic area in eastern and central China, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, and Liaoning Provinces (1) . Heightened surveillance of acute febrile illness has led researchers to add Zhejiang, a southeastern province, to the list of regions where SFTSV is endemic (3) . This indicates that this disease is continuing to spread in China. Recently, a bunyavirus named Heartland virus (HLV) has been isolated from patients from Missouri in the United States. HLV has 70% homology to the Chinese virus based on amino acid sequences (4) . The clinical symptoms of HLV infection are similar to those caused by SFTSV. One case of human SFTS outside China has been reported (5) . This demonstrates that SFTSV or a virus similar to SFTSV probably has worldwide distribution.",

This unidentified epitope was found to be conserved among disparate geographic virus isolates within China, since MAb 4-5 shows a cross-neutralizing activity. The mode of inhibition was also characterized, indicating that MAb 4-5 mediates neutralization by blocking the binding of Gn to the cellular receptor.

To determine its neutralization potency, MAb 4-5 IgG1 was subjected to serial dilutions with 2-fold increments and titrated against the JS-2010-003 strain. As shown in Fig. 2B , MAb 4-5 IgG1 exhibited far more potent neutralization activity against SFTSV than its ScFv format. This was consistent with its superior avidity. The concentration required to obtain 50% neutralization of 100 TCID 50 SFTSV was about 2.0 g/ml, but the same activity was achieved by MAb 4-5 ScFv at a concen-tration of 25 g/ml. The control antibody did not exhibit any neutralization activity against SFTSV. The neutralization breadth of MAb 4-5 IgG1was investigated by using a panel of different SFTSV isolates obtained from regions where SFTSV is endemic, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, and Zhejiang, between 2010 and 2012 (Table 1 ). MAb 4-5 IgG1 was separately incubated in the presence of 100 TCID 50 of SFTSV isolates for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before incubation with Vero cells. Complete protection from most SFTSV strains was achieved at a dose of 5 g/ml MAb 4-5 IgG1.

            "text": "The viral envelope glycoproteins of SFTSV, such as Gn and Gc, mediate receptor attachment and the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, giving the viral genome access to the host cell's cyto-plasm. Antibodies can inhibit viral infection through two distinct mechanisms that occur in parallel with the stages of viral entry into the cells. They can directly block viral attachment to target cells by interfering with virus-receptor interactions. These include antibodies against the S1 protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (25) and antibodies against the envelope protein of West Nile virus (26) . Antibodies can also target viral receptors, as exemplified by treatment of arenavirus infection with an anti-human transferring receptor antibody (27) . During viral entry via endocytosis, antibodies may block the conformational changes in envelope protein required for fusion between viral and endosomal membranes. For example, some antihemagglutinin MAbs neutralize the infectivity of the influenza virus by interfering with the low pH-induced structural rearrangements in the HA2 domain, inhibiting of fusion during viral replication (21, 28) . In this study, consistent with the first mechanism described above, MAb 4-5 generated from the memory B cell repertoire of SFTS convalescent patients was found to neutralize SFTSV infectivity by interfering with the interactions between the virus and its receptor, because the recombinant Gn ectodomain cannot bind susceptible Vero cells after incubation with the MAb 4-5 ScFv format (Fig. 7) . Structurally, the Gn and Gc of viruses in the Bunyaviridae family are typical class I transmembrane proteins. They have amino termini exposed on the surfaces of the virions and the carboxy terminus anchored in the membrane (10) . A functional domain has been predicted for Gn of SFTSV, and the result of the domain mapping for MAb 4-5 showed that the Gn domain (aa 20 to 452), which is located at the amino terminus, is bound by the antibody, demonstrating that this ectodomain is the primary domain for cellular membrane attachment, corresponding to the putative exposed loop for receptor binding in bunyavirus. As reported for other members of Bunyaviridae (29) (30) (31) (32) , viral neutralization sites are located on both the Gn and Gc. In the present study, due to the limited number of clones selected, the antibody described here was against Gn, and the identification of potential neutralizing antibodies against Gc merits further exploration.",

This indicates that the epitope for MAb 4-5 is conserved among diverse SFTSV strains. It has a single-stranded RNA genome, so the genetic evolution of SFTSV may have accrued in terms of mutation and reassortment (33) . However, very little is known about the details of this process. This uncharacterized epitope can resist the host immune pressure and plays a critical role in the receptor binding that takes place during viral transmission. MAb 4-5 may tolerate the antigenic variability of circulating SFTSV variants and maintain its ability to neutralize the viruses. Another unique feature of MAb 4-5 is that it reacts with a linear epitope rather than a conformational one (Fig. 3A) . This may facilitate rational vaccine design. These data underscore the importance of broadly crossreactive, surface-exposed epitopes on the N-terminal domain of Gn in the design of protective SFTSV vaccines.",

Combinations of antibodies against a variety of structural epitopes on glycoproteins may expand the breadth of protection offered and limit the number of potential immune escape variants (35) . However, screening for neutralizing antibodies can isolate only one clone per study. There are several reasons that may account for this. Although phage display-based selections are currently the most commonly used method of developing human MAbs, its inherent selection biases are difficult to control during panning because antibody folding efficiency, posttranslational modification, and epitope accessibility to different display hosts can all influence the outcome of selection (34) . Second, the method of antigen presentation during panning may affect the number and distribution of available neutralizing epitopes. In this study, it is postulated that the exposed epitope within the receptor binding domain of the Gn protein on the surface of virion should be easily recognized by antibodies, such as MAb 4-5, but the epitopes exposed only during viral fusion cannot be accessed by antibodies under these selection conditions. Third, there is still a possibility that antibody clones against other abundant viral antigens (e.g., nucleocapsid protein) may overshadow those against glycoproteins during panning, which might otherwise be screened out. New strategies may be required to deplete the library of phages that can bind irrelevant targets to enhance specific clone enrichment ratios.",

Further work will be required to delineate the precise structure of this epitope, which may have important implications for the design of vaccines capable of eliciting a protective MAb 4-5-like antibody response. Since the results reported here were generated in vitro, antiviral activities of MAb 4-5 in vivo are under way in our laboratory. Overall, MAb 4-5 may be used as a promising candidate molecule for emergency prophylaxis and treatment of SFTSV infection.",
