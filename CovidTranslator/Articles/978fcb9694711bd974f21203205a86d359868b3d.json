Sputum samples treated with 4% sodium hydroxide solution and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were placed in virus transport medium (minimum essential medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 5% penicillin/streptomycin, and amphotericin B) immediately after collection and subsequently stored at \u221280\u00b0C.
