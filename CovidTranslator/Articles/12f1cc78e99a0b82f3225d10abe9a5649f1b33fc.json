HCoV-NL63 may have infected human populations for a long time, since it diverged phylogenetically from HCoV-229E about 1,000 years ago (33) , and seroprevalence would likely be high as a result. Cross-sectional and longitudinal seroepidemiological studies have found large proportions of children and healthy adults to have detectable serum antibodies to the four HCoV strains, and seroconversion occurs often in childhood; seroprevalence increases with age, and reinfections may occur (5, 8, 23, 28, (36) (37) (38) . More information is needed about the seroprevalence of these viruses, the durability of the humoral immune response, correlates of immunity, and mucosal antibody responses to HCoV infection. The present study questioned whether the prevalence of antibodies to the four HCoV strains would be different in nasal secretions than in serum of older adult veterans with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who participated in Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study 448 (18) .",

Expression vector pET-28b(\u03e9) (Novagen, Inc., New Canaan, CT), encoding the N protein of HCoV-HKU1 cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites in frame and downstream from a series of six-histidine residues, as described previously (45, 46) , was a gift from K. Y. Yuen (University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong). The recombinant N protein was expressed by the transformation of BL21(DE3) single competent cells (Novagen, Inc.) by the plasmid and was purified by use of the Ni 2\u03e9 -loaded HiTrap chelating system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (16) . In brief, transformed cells were disrupted, and the protein sample was prepared by the isolation of inclusion bodies via sonication and washing. The protein sample was loaded onto the HiTrap chelating HP column prepacked with precharged highperformance Ni 2\u03e9 Sepharose. The protein was then purified and refolded by serial buffer washes of the column and by liquid chromatography in a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Pharmacia LBK Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ), with elution of protein, which was collected in fractions. The fractions were analyzed for the presence of the 53-kDa protein by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and was adjusted to 3 g/ml for the ELISA. Mock antigen was produced from the same plasmid DNA vector, but without the N protein gene sequence, by the same procedure.",

An endpoint anti-HCoV antibody titer was the final dilution of the nasal wash specimen with an OD in the antigen-coated well of 0.3 or greater and that was at least twice that of the respective control, as described previously (17, 19) . The total IgA antibody concentration in the nasal wash specimens was determined previously by ELISA (17) . Briefly, the sequence of reagents beginning with the solid phase was goat anti-human IgA (ICN/Cappel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aurora, OH), the nasal wash specimen, goat anti-human IgA (\u2423-chain specific) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and o-phenylenediamine substrate. The standard curve of known secretory IgA concentrations was determined by using serial dilutions of human secretory IgA (ICN Biomedical, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) instead of nasal wash specimens in the ELISA. We repeated the measurement of total IgA concentrations in this study, finding that there was no decay in the total IgA concentration in these specimens that were stored at \u03ea70\u00b0C for about 9 years after their initial collection. The anti-HCoV IgA antibody titer in nasal wash specimens was mathematically adjusted to an arbitrary total IgA antibody concentration of 100 mg/liter using the measured total IgA antibody concentration for each specimen.",

Patients represented a broad geographic distribution, from the Midwestern, Southern, and Northeastern regions of the United States. A wide range of IgG and IgA antibody titers against HCoV was observed. The levels of mean IgG antibody to HCoV-229E and -OC43 were higher than levels of mean IgG antibody to HCoV-NL63 and -HKU1, respectively.

The concomitant presence of IgA antibody to more than one HCoV strain was observed for some nasal wash specimens but was universal in the case of serum IgG antibody to HCoV. The findings may reflect previous infections of patients with more than one viral strain, antibody cross-reactivity between strains due to HCoV group-specific rather than strain-specific antigens, better induction of mucosal IgA antibodies by certain HCoV strains and a shorter period of detectability after infection in secretions than in serum, and a better preservation of antibodies in the nasal wash specimens with antibody to HCoV than in those that had no detectable anti-HCoV antibody despite similar storage conditions. However, the amount of total IgA in the specimens did not decline during storage, so strainspecific IgA antibodies should not have decayed in storage either. Correlation of serum IgG antibody titers within and across HCoV groups showed a more striking association between the levels of antibody to the HCoV strains within each group than across groups. This may reflect antigenic crossreactivity within HCoV groups but less so between groups. Also, cross-reactive IgA antibodies to HCoV strains between HCoV groups were generally not observed in high-titer nasal wash specimens.",

The prevalence of serum antibodies to HCoV-229E and -OC43 in our study was higher than those reported previously by Hruskova et al.

Children in the Netherlands aged 2.5 to 3.5 years had serum antibodies to HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E in 75% and 65% of serum samples collected cross-sectionally, respectively (8). Severance et al. (37) previously reported seroprevalence rates of about 90% for HCoV-229E, -NL63, and -OC43 among a largely adult population in Maryland but a seroprevalence rate of only 59% for HCoV-HKU1, which is lower than that reported in the present study. In seroepidemiological studies of families including children and young adults in one community, a high prevalence of antibodies to HCoV-229E and -OC43 was reported, and frequent reinfections occurred despite preexisting serum antibody (27) .

The receptor that HCoV-NL63 uses to find and enter target cells is unique among group I and II coronaviruses but is the same as that for SARS coronavirus. This receptor is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is present on arterial and venous endothelial cells, arterial smooth-muscle cells, and small intestine and tracheobronchial airway epithelia (32) . ACE2 helps regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is activated in heart failure, by inactivating angiotensin II, and ACE2 plays a role in protection from severe acute lung injury (3, 24, 32) . Among the human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 in particular has been associated with croup (31, 35, 43) .",

(5) reported previously that IgA antibodies to HCoV-229E were detectable in nasal wash specimens after experimental infection of adults with the virus and that the IgA antibody levels declined during follow-up but remained higher than preinfection levels 52 weeks later. Another previous report by Callow (4) suggested that HCoV-229E-specific antibodies in serum and nasal wash specimens were correlated with protection from experimental infection with HCoV-229E and disease, and IgA antibodies to HCoV-229E in nasal wash specimens were associated with a reduced duration of viral shedding in nasal secretions. Hence, despite the near-universal presence of serum antibodies to the HCoV strains in our study, the lower rates of detectable IgA antibodies to HCoV suggest a possible reason for susceptibility to reinfections with HCoV, if IgA antibodies in nasal secretions are indeed protective.",

It appears likely that patients may experience infections with more than one strain of HCoV. We did not measure IgA antibody to HCoV in serum in this study, since we were more interested in its presence in respiratory secretions, the compartment in which IgA is an important mediator of specific immunity. Based on the much lower frequency of patients with HCoV-specific IgA antibody in nasal wash specimens than of those with IgG in serum in our older adult population, one might hypothesize that antibodies to HCoV in nasal secretions decline in titer more rapidly after infection than do serum antibodies or that infection does not induce IgA antibody to HCoV in nasal secretions to high titers or at all in a significant proportion of older, chronically ill patients with COPD. Whether the induction of virus-specific, mucosal IgA antibodies by HCoV infection and their durability are different in older, chronically ill adults than in younger, healthy adults and children will require further study. Delineation of the relative importance of IgA antibodies in nasal secretions and serum IgG antibodies as immune correlates of protection against infection with HCoV and the role that antibodies that cross-react among HCoV strains may play in protection from or pathogenesis of HCoV infection would assist in devising approaches to the development of vaccines that could prevent HCoV infection.",
