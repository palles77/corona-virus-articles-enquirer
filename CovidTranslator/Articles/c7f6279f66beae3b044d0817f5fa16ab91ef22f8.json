This protein family includes several homologous proteins and a collection of other proteins lacking sequence similarity except for a BH3 motif. Thus, membership in the Bcl-2 family requires only one of the four BH (Bcl-2 homology) motifs. On this basis, a growing number of diverse BH3-only proteins are being reported. While compelling cell biological and biophysical evidence validates many BH3-only proteins, claims about significant BH3 sequence similarity are often unfounded. Computational and phylogenetic analyses suggest that only some BH3 motifs arose by divergent evolution from a common ancestor (homology), while others arose by convergent evolution or random coincidence (homoplasy), challenging current assumptions about which proteins constitute the extended Bcl-2 family.",

Despite the usefulness of this paradigmatic classification scheme, close inspection of BH motif sequences indicates that subfamily classifications draw heavily on prior knowledge of protein functions (details below). Overextension of computational methods and subjective interpretations of sequence similarities have expanded the Bcl-2 family beyond justifiable limits. To gain a better understanding, we considered the possible origins of BH motifs by applying bioinformatics and phylogenetic concepts to more rigorously identify four distinct subfamilies of the extended Bcl-2 family. Three of these (Bcl2-like, Bax-like, Bid-like) form a monophyletic group (share a common ancestor) (Fig. 3) , and a fourth is composed of eight unrelated (or very distantly related) canonical BH3-only proteins (Fig. 2) . Inclusion of these specific eight in the canonical BH3-only subgroup is also heavily dependent on prior knowledge. Bias in Bcl-2 subfamily nomenclature extends beyond amino acid sequence analysis. Assignment to anti-death or pro-death subgroups is challenging for those family members that lack obvious cell death-related phenotypes (e.g. Bok and Bcl2L13), and for those that can exhibit either anti-death or pro-death activity in different conditions or cell types. For example, Drosophila Buffy, mammalian Bcl-x L , and worm CED-9 are all traditionally categorized as anti-apoptotic, but all three have also been shown to exhibit prodeath activity in vivo [7] [8] [9] . Here we illustrate the methodological and conceptual issues that have arisen in defining and classifying the various other BH3-containing proteins reported to date.",

Three-dimensional structures have been determined for many Bcl-2 family members, revealing a series of approximately 9 alpha helices with a central helical hairpin. Although several dimer interfaces have been identified between Bcl-2 family members, the best characterized is the interaction of BH3-only proteins with anti-death Bcl-2 proteins. The BH3-containing helix of BH3-only proteins inserts into a deep elongated binding cleft on anti-death Bcl-2 proteins, resulting in the inactivation of either or both binding partners [10] [11] [12] . By inhibiting BH3-only proteins or by directly binding Bax (multi-BH pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homolog), Bcl-x L can prevent homo-oligomerization of Bax that otherwise leads to mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP). Through MOMP, mitochondrial cytochrome c is released to act as a cytosolic co-factor for assembly of caspase-activating apoptosomes, and cell death occurs within a few minutes [13] . Because anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins promote tumor cell survival, BH3 mimetics have been developed as cancer therapeutics [14] .",

It is widely assumed that the BH4 distinguishes all anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins from pro-death members that lack a BH4, but solid evidence for this delineation is lacking. For instance, most multiple alignment programs fail to align the BH4 motifs of the original trio (Bcl-2, Bcl-x L and Bclw) with the putative BH4 of their anti-apoptotic homologs Mcl-1 and Bfl-1/A1 ( Fig. 2 and S1A). Furthermore, when we used InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan/), a popular motif-prediction tool that searches a given sequence against a compilation of protein signatures from different databases (e.g. PROSITE, PFAM), BH4 motifs were not identified in these latter proteins, nor in the other anti-apoptotic (Bcl-B/Bcl2L10 and Drosophila Buffy) or more distantly related pro-apoptotic members (Bax, Bak and Bok) (Figs. 2, S1B and S1C). These sequence differences are paralleled by sensitivity of the same three BH4containing proteins to the BH3 mimetic ABT-737, though ABT-737 does not directly contact the BH4. However, all (uncleaved) Bcl-2 family proteins contain the N-terminal helix that encompasses the BH4 motif [19] .",

However, when we used this novel sequence signature for database searching, it produced high false positive rates, including multiple BH4 motifs within individual Bcl-2 family proteins (Fig. 2) . Defining BH4 can be further complicated by divergent sequences present on either side of helix 1 (e.g. the long Nterminal extension of Mcl-1, and the large unstructured loop between BH4 and BH3 of Bclx L ) ( Fig. 2 and S1C). While these difficulties do not rule out the presence of an evolutionarily conserved BH4 region among all Bcl-2 paralogs (e.g. defined by specific structural contacts), currently available bioinformatics has not clearly justified this classification as a sequence motif.",

Thus, in contrast to current nomenclature, Bid does not belong in the subgroup of canonical BH3-only proteins, but instead belongs to a branch of the Bcl-2 phylogenetic tree with Bcl2L12, -13, -14, and -15, which generally lacks C-terminal transmembrane domains ( Fig. 3 and Fig. S1B ). Bid is an example of misclassification by applying the BH motif criteria alone, while additional evidence strongly argues for an evolutionary relationship (homology) between Bid and the Bcl-2 family. Yet the criterion for direct activator type BH3-only proteins is defined by the biochemical properties of Bid (activated/caspasecleaved tBid or its BH3 peptide). Thus, Bid may have additional functions in apoptosis regulation, beyond its BH3.",

Yet a large body of compelling functional and structural evidence supports the existence of a BH3-like motif in Beclin 1. Through this BH3-mediated interaction of Beclin 1 with Bcl-2 proteins, autophagy appears to be functionally linked to the control of apoptosis. While it seems obvious that the BH3 motifs of Bcl-2 and of Beclin 1 have distinct origins, it is also possible that some BH3-only proteins currently classified as Bcl-2 family members have BH3 sequence similarities due to either random coincidence or convergent evolution (selection of the same residues for identical functional reasons). To further clarify, there is no denial that the core BH3 motif sequence Leu-X(3)-Gly-Asp is present in many proteins and can be aligned by hand in a diagram, but this does not imply that they are homologous or are functionally equivalent. Conversely, the lack of verifiable sequence similarity using currently available bioinformatics does not negate the potential importance of BH3-like motifs in biology. There may be other cases where divergence accumulated over evolutionary time scales, producing proteins that will exhibit similarities only in this short region. Thus, the denomination of BH3-only protein carries some degree of ambiguity because many proteins that logically qualify for this designation belong to different protein families and contain other (non-BH) motifs.",

A number of viruses, including herpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), encode compact Bcl-2 homologous proteins (BHRF1 and KS-Bcl-2, respectively) with significant sequence similarity in the BH1-BH2 motifs and high structural similarity [29, 30] . The finding that Bcl-2 homologs are encoded in the genomes of several different families of large DNA viruses, probably as a result of independent horizontal gene transfer events (HGT) from their respective host cells, suggest that the Bcl-2 structural fold can be acquired other than by vertical descent. By contrast to the structurally defined Bcl-2 protein fold, which forms a single protein domain (helical bundle), individual BH motifs do not constitute separate protein domains [19] . Furthermore, sequence similarity of BH3 is not sufficient to automatically infer common ancestral origins [31] (see BOX 1) . This raises the question of how BH3 motifs arose in so many diverse proteins. The most logical assumption to explain the functionally and structurally validated BH3 motifs in unrelated proteins is that they arose independently on multiple occasions (homoplasy), owing to specific constraints (either biological or physicochemical), facilitating interactions with Bcl-2 family proteins. The surprising proteome-wide prevalence of potential BH3 motifs (see BOX 1) suggests that they could correspond to a particular class of short linear motifs [32] used as a binding interface to connect critical components of various biological pathways to the core apoptotic machinery.",

Similar difficulties challenge the evolutionary origins of RNA viruses, where high mutation rates obscure ancestral origins [36] . Advances in structural genomics and remote homology detection coupled with the growing size of sequence databases will hopefully made it possible to capture more ancient evolutionary events, and possibly reveal connections between previously unrecognized Bcl-2-like proteins. In the meantime we can only attempt to avoid a mammalian-centric perspective. Indeed, interacting proteins are known to evolve and co-evolve in a lineage-specific manner [37] , and interacting proteins often display similar evolutionary histories [38, 39] (see BOX 2) .",

This could conceivably reflect conservation of function if mammalian Bcl-2 family proteins interface with highly conserved cellular machinery. Consistent with this model, Bcl-x L and Mcl-1 were recently reported to interact with the highly conserved mitochondrial ATP synthase [44, 45] . One potential implication would be that yeast and bacteria encode yet unrecognized Bcl-2-shaped proteins to explain why they maintain the ability to interact with mammalian Bcl-2 proteins. Pursuit of these answers is seriously compromised until such putative Bcl-2-like proteins are identified in non-metazoans, and there are equally valid alternative explanations that do not evoke conservation of function. Ectopically expressed mammalian Bcl-2 proteins may use different mechanisms to modulate cell survival/death in yeast by acting on distinct effector proteins. Alternatively, Bcl-2 proteins could act on lipid membranes, such as changing membrane curvature in a manner that does not require specific interactions with foreign proteins. Experimental investigation of yeast will likely provide tremendous insight into many different cell death mechanisms, and may even reveal yet unknown mechanisms of mammalian Bcl-2 proteins [46, 47] . However, the epistemic goal in this case would be different, to uncover the mechanisms of action of Bcl-2 family proteins, which is fundamentally different from establishing phylogenetic inferences (see BOX 3) .",

These findings destabilize the idea of CED-9 being a prototypical multi-BH protein, and that simpler metazoans are necessarily less equipped than complex ones.

The examples presented here illustrate the difficulty in interpreting functional versus phylogenetic similarities of the diverse BH3 sequence motifs reported to date, and in handling the potential huge number of predicted BH3-containing proteins. More reliable strategies are therefore needed to identify and classify functional BH3 motif-containing proteins by defined and generally acceptable standards.

Published BH3 motif searches have relied mainly on deterministic sequence patterns, such as the regular expression PS01259 of the PROSITE database (InterPro signature IPR020728). When we applied this pattern to search the database (UNI60/UniProtKB with sequences \u226460% identity to avoid multiple copies of a same sequence), it recovered only two of the eight canonical BH3-only proteins, BIK and HRK ( Fig. 2 and S2 ). Several groups have defined less stringent consensus sequences in attempt to capture more of the canonical BH3-only proteins [53] . Applying their 7-mer as a search criterion, we identified only one additional BH3-only protein (Bim) and 33,558 additional putative hits ( Fig. 4 and S2 ). Similar problems arise with the reported 9residue [54] , 12-residue [55] , and 13-residue regular expressions [56] , one of which identified 25% of all proteins. The situation deteriorates if reported consensus patterns are modified additum (ad) to capture all of the BH3 sequences that were included in their respective published alignments (Figs. 2 and 4, Supplementary information 3). By extending this search to plants, microorganisms and viruses, we identified putative BH3only proteins in species that lack Bcl-2 homologs with which to interact (e.g. Chlamydomonas, Arabidopsis) and that lack true mitochondria (e.g. Giardia, Trichomonas). Furthermore, there was strikingly little overlap between hit lists, and the number of hits was not significantly different when the proteomes were shuffled or reversed (rearrangements of the same amino acids), and (Fig. 4, Supplementary  information 3) .

Structure determinations and evidence for direct interactions of putative BH3 peptides with confirmed Bcl-2-homologous proteins using fluorescence polarization, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or surface plasmon resonance have been applied to confirm new BH3 motifs, in addition to cell-based evidence to validate biochemical studies [62] . BH3 candidacy would also be supported by functional conservation in closely related species, and by the pairing of a BH3 candidate with its target Bcl-2 family member in the same species, or perhaps with an invading intracellular pathogen. In the absence of a host parasite relationship, candidate BH3-only proteins encoded by non-metazoan species lacking Bcl-2 homologues or true mitochondria are difficult to justify (see BOX 3) . There are potentially a large number of clinically relevant peptides and small molecules that fit into the hydrophobic pockets of various Bcl-2 family proteins and mimic natural ligands. Though not derived from a natural protein, the case can be made to include peptides selected from an artificial library as bona fide BH3 motifs [63] , with the potential appellation of 'BH3-like', 'BH3-mimetic', or 'BH3 functional analog'.",

The reported assignment of a BH3 motif to yeast Ybh3 was made by visual inspection, and the multiple alignment reveals only two fully conserved residues (Leu and Asp) followed by a less conserved amino acid (Asp or Glu).

            "text": "derived from the reported alignment yields 160 matches (in 156 proteins). This candidate yeast BH3 sequence is also somewhat truncated as it is located at the C-terminus of the Ybh3 protein, and it overlaps one of six transmembrane segments, two unprecedented features among BH3containing proteins. Furthermore, the putative BH3 sequence lacks conservation in orthologous proteins, potentially challenging functional importance. Although this BH3 was reported to bind Bcl-x L and to promote yeast cell death, two other studies have reported that this yeast gene is pro-survival, not pro-death, consistent with BI-1 function in other species [65] [66] [67] . More perplexing is how this yeast protein might ever encounter human Bcl-x L . Nevertheless, it is conceivable that non-metazoan species will be found to encode proteins that closely resemble the three-dimensional structure of Bcl-2 family proteins to serve as a potential target of this yeast BH3 [68] . Nevertheless, currently available tools to define BH3 motifs in non-metazoan suggest that Ybh3 is just as likely to reflect a fortuitous event, though this does not negate its utility in research if it binds tightly and specifically to the cleft of Bcl-2. Discovery timeline for the conglomerate Bcl-2 family. First publication year for proteins with documented or predicted structural similarity with Bcl-2 (above line) and for proteins reported to contain only the BH3 motif (below line). [Note that the Bcl-2 protein coding region was published two years after the gene was identified in 1984.] For official and alternate protein names, see Fig. 2 ; anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-related proteins (green); Bax-like pro-apoptotic members (orange); Bid-like divergent Bcl-2 homologs (brown); canonical BH3-only proteins (blue); other reported BH3-containing proteins (black); viral proteins (gray). Experimental identification: grey filled circles. Techniques employed: S, direct sequencing; H, hybridization; P, PCR; E, EST screen; C, coimmunoprecipitation; I, protein interactive cloning; Y, yeast two-hybrid; D, differential screening; G, genetic screen; F, functional screen; 3D, structure determination. Bioinformatic prediction: purple filled circles. Visual inspection: orange filled circles. Evidence for BH motif compositions in Bcl-2 family proteins and candidate BH3-containing proteins. Schematic representation of protein size and BH motif composition for Bcl-2 homologous proteins (including Bcl-2-like and Bax-like subgroups), canonical BH3-only proteins and a large category of other reported BH3-containing proteins (with UniProtKB accession numbers), many of which have not been validated (blue circles). A three-level color coding system indicates BH type (see color key) and supporting evidence: (i) BH motifs predicted by InterProScan (bright color, meaning BH is predicted), (ii) BH motifs that appear in the NCBI entry for this protein (light shades, meaning BH is uncertain or false positive due to automatic annotation), (iii) BH motifs not predicted or annotated as above, Phylogenetic tree of Bcl-2 homologous proteins. Neighbor-joining tree calculated using Poisson-corrected amino acid distances upon 74 sites in the core Bcl-2 domain encompassing the BH3 motif (or homologous site) through the BH2. The tree was rooted with CED-9 sequences from Caenorhabditis. Numbers indicate bootstrap percentages after 1000 replications; values below 50% are not reported. Branch lengths are proportional to distances between sequences. Sequence names contain abbreviations of genus and species (see Supplementary information 2); primarily anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-related proteins (green), primarily pro-apoptotic Bax-like members (orange), and Bid-like divergent homologs (brown). BH4 and BH3 motif searches identify improbable numbers of hits throughout major phylogenetic groups. InterPro signatures and patterns derived from published alignments (see legend to Fig. 2 ) were used to scan UniProt KnowledgeBase with reduced redundancy (no more than 60% identity, UNI60; release 2011_12) for sequences containing BH3 or BH4 motifs. Pie charts show the percent of proteins in each of the phylogenetic groups that were identified as hits by the indicated signature search. The total number of hits detected is shown within the pie chart.",
