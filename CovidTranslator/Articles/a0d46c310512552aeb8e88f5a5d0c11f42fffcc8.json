            "text": "Live-attenuated RNA virus vaccines are efficacious but subject to reversion to virulence. Among RNA viruses, replication fidelity is recognized as a key determinant of virulence and escape from antiviral therapy; increased fidelity is attenuating for some viruses. Coronavirus replication fidelity is approximately 20-fold greater than that of other RNA viruses and is mediated by a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity (ExoN) that likely functions in RNA proofreading. In this study, we demonstrate that engineered inactivation of SARS-CoV ExoN activity results in a stable mutator phenotype with profoundly decreased fidelity in vivo and attenuation of pathogenesis in young, aged, and immunocompromised mouse models of human SARS. The ExoN inactivation genotype and mutator phenotype are stable and do not revert to virulence, even after serial passage or longterm persistent infection in vivo. Our approach represents a strategy with potential for broad applications for the stable attenuation of coronaviruses and possibly other RNA viruses.",

High mutation rates generate considerable genomic diversity, allowing RNA viruses to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions and hosts 12 . Increased replication fidelity has been shown to reduce virulence for poliovirus and chikungunya virus [12] [13] [14] and has been proposed as a strategy for live-attenuated virus design 15 . Coronaviruses (CoVs) encode the largest known RNA virus genomes (26 to 32 kb), exceeding the theoretical limits of viable RNA genome size 11 . CoV mutation rates have been calculated to occur at lower frequencies than in other RNA viruses, approaching 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mutations per site per round of replication 16 . Nsp14, encoded in the viral replicase gene, contains a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) of the DEDDh exonuclease superfamily 17 . In addition to the CoVs, ExoN homologs are present in the members of the Nidovirales order whose genomes are >20 kb but are not present in the smaller arteriviruses (12-16 kb) , suggesting that the ExoN played a critical role in genome expansion 16, 18 . In vitro 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity has been demonstrated for recombinant SARS-CoV nsp14 19 . We have engineered and recovered viable ExoN inactivation mutants from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-ExoN) and SARS-CoV (SARS-ExoN). Both MHV-ExoN and SARS-ExoN inactivations are maintained stably for more than 10 passages in vitro and exhibit 15-to 20fold-increased mutation frequencies compared to wildtype MHV and SARS-CoV 16, 20 . Thus, ExoN plays a critical role in CoV RNA genome replication fidelity in vitro, likely by directly mediating or stimulating proofreading, a function previously unknown among RNA viruses 21 .",

In this study, we evaluated: 1) the impact of the inactivation of an RNA-proofreading exonuclease and the resultant mutator phenotype on CoV replication, fitness, and pathogenesis; 2) virus stability after passage or persistence in vivo; and 3) the efficacy of using a decreased-fidelity mutant as a vaccine.

MA-ExoN displayed a stable <1-log growth defect (Fig. 1c) . When placed in direct competition, MA-ExoN was clearly less fit than MAwt over successive rounds of infection ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a, b) . MA-ExoN genome RNA levels were roughly equivalent at 6 h post-infection (p.i.) to those of MAwt and were reduced at 12 h p.i., but MA-ExoN genome RNA levels were approximately 10% that of MAwt levels by 24 h p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 1c) . Thus, the data suggest that MA-ExoN is able to initiate and establish replication efficiently through times of peak RNA synthesis (0-6 h) but is impaired in accumulation, which manifests late in one round of infection and is amplified over multiple rounds. The results are consistent with accumulating defects resulting from a profoundly increased mutation rate (see Discussion).",

To test this, viral genomes from viral plaques grown from 30-d SCID lung homogenates were sequenced ( Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table  2 ). For MAwt, a total of 14 consensus mutations were identified (~100,000 nt), with 3 mutations shared in 2 or 3 genomes, resulting in 11 distinct mutations (4 synonymous [S] and 7 nonsynonymous [NS]). For MA-ExoN, the engineered inactivation mutations were maintained. In contrast to MAwt, MA-ExoN plaques contained a total of 91 mutations (89 distinct -32 S and 57 NS), constituting a 9.6-fold higher total mutation accumulation compared to MAwt. Table 2) for statistical determinations. Mutation accumulations were significantly higher in MA-ExoN-infected mice for both regions (P < 0.01). Additionally, there was a mean 18.3-fold accumulation increase for MA-ExoN across the ORF1a region. When accumulations of mutations were normalized per 10 kb, MA-ExoN mutation accumulations in ORF1a vs. ORF1b regions were not significantly different (P = 0.340) but remained significantly increased compared to MAwt (P < 0.001 for both ORF1a and ORF1b). No new mutations were identified in all three MA-ExoN plaques, suggesting no obligatory or consistent pattern of adaptation or mutational bias. The most prevalent mutation identified (C16999M) was also present in viral stocks as a polymorphism; however, its frequency in the viral population remained stable (~40%) both in vitro and in vivo and in experiments with both BALB/c and SCID mice (Supplementary Table 2 and data not shown). The results from ExoN persistent infection over 30 d were consistent with the results from passage of SARS-ExoN virus in culture: the ratios of accumulation of unique mutations (MA-ExoN:MAwt) during replication in SCID mice ranged from ~9.6 to 18.3:1, similar to that measured between S-ExoN and SARS-CoV in culture 16 .",

However, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that both stable and evolving defects resulting from the mutator phenotype have irrevocably attenuated MA-ExoN. These defects could include: 1) mutations that impair or terminate translation, replication, and transcription; 2) mutations that impair or abolish protein functions; and 3) changes in RNA polymerase processivity in the presence of an inactivated proofreading exonuclease. These combined impairments may be profoundly manifested with CoV ExoN mutants, as the high number of accumulated mutations per genome is unprecedented among viral mutator strains. Indeed, the phenotype is similar to those reported for model systems with inactivated exonucleases, such as the human mitochondrial DNA polymerase \u03b3 (pol \u03b3) 32,33 and bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase [34] [35] [36] . In pol \u03b3 studies, the loss of proofreading was associated with impaired polymerase activity in a manner that is likely causal, impossible to uncouple, and characterized by decreased speed, increased template dissociation, and restricted access of nucleotides to the polymerase active site 32, 33 . For CoVs, the high levels of iterative amplification of both genomic and subgenomic RNA would further accelerate these deleterious processes by providing aberrant templates. The loss of ExoN proofreading would continuously generate new potentially attenuating alleles and defective genomes and would reduce both genome fitness (Supplementary Fig. 1 ) and the risks for primary and secondary reversions to virulence.",

SCID persistent infection experiments verified the accumulation of mutations across the genome, without evidence for the selection of either phenotypic virulence-enhancing alleles or primary genotypic reversion. Viruses harvested after passage remained avirulent, supporting conclusions that: 1) selection for virulence is not occurring; 2) selection is being outcompeted by the gradual accumulation of attenuating mutations in individual genomes or the in the population mutational swarm; or 3) the mutant is unable to generate or select for either fast-growing or slow-clearing viruses that are also more virulent. Not surprisingly, a limited number of polymorphisms (Supplementary Table 3 ) were identified in the MA-ExoN virus stock that was used in subsequent experiments. Viruses with and without these mutations were fully attenuated in vivo (Fig. 5f) , and the mutations were also maintained in lungs in the same frequencies as they were in the virus stock, suggesting that they were not selected against during passage in vivo (Supplementary Table 2 ).

We have demonstrated that MA-ExoN possesses both of these characteristics. In all circumstances, the engineered inactivation mutations were maintained, indicating that exonuclease activity is not critical for the virus life cycle and that the 4-nt, 2aa change presents a substantial barrier to primary reversion; further, the passage experiments suggest that the virus lacks redundant or complementing mechanisms to fully restore the loss of ExoN activity. Finally, MA-ExoN harvested from persistently infected SCID mice retained an attenuated phenotype when re-inoculated into mice, suggesting that persistence does not select for virulence. Future studies will address whether additional modifications could serve to enhance and stabilize the attenuated phenotype by reducing the likelihood of gain of function by homologous recombination, such as introduction of the ExoN inactivation in the TRS-rewired background 38 , which could increase resistance to reversion.",
