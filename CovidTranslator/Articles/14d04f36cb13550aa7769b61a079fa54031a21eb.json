Data were collected from 2081 adults (16+) using a module of questions incorporated into the NSW Health Adult Population Health Survey. High levels of willingness to comply were reported with 73% either very or extremely willing to receive vaccination, 67% willing to isolate themselves, 58% willing to wear a face mask, and 48% willing to comply with all three behaviors. Further analysis indicated concern for self and family and higher levels of education were associated with high levels of willingness to comply. Younger people (16-24) were the least willing to comply; especially with wearing a face mask. Those with children reported higher levels of willingness to receive vaccination, and respondents who speak a language other than English at home were less willing to isolate themselves or comply with all behaviors. These fi ndings provide a baseline measure of anticipated public compliance with key public health behaviors in the event of an infl uenza pandemic in the Australian population, and help to identify groups that may be more resistant to individual measures and may require additional attention in terms of risk communication strategies or health education.",

In addition, better estimates of population compliance with such measures is valuable when assessing their contributions in the mathematical modeling of pandemics and in estimating the effectiveness of pandemic control decisions and policies; both in terms of disease containment and cost. A recent systematic review of physical interventions to reduce the spread of respiratory diseases 1 has clearly demonstrated the signifi cant contribution of simple low-cost interventions, such as mask-wearing and hand washing. Data in this review, from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related studies, indicated that mask-wearing reduced risk of spread by 68%; a fi gure that increased to 91% if N95 masks were worn.",

Where possible, the continuation of daily activities is likely to be important for population mental health as well as commercial and economic resilience.",

State pandemic vaccination plans promote use of pneumococcal vaccination and inter-pandemic (or seasonal) infl uenza vaccine for priority and at-risk groups, and the WHO has recommended seasonal infl uenza vaccinations for health care workers to reduce risks of genetic shifts in the avian infl uenza virus and to minimize \"background noise\" in the event of an outbreak. 4 Pandemicstrain vaccination may take a number of months to supply in suffi cient quantities for population-level vaccination, however, if there was suffi cient lag in the global spread of infl uenza to Australia a widespread mass vaccination of the population could become a key preventative national strategy. Willingness to go into isolation or quarantine (either voluntarily or compulsorily) may also become a requirement of the containment strategy at state and national levels.",

In the comparative Europe/Asia study, 15 45%-52% would limit contact with family and friends, and 24%-35% would stay indoors. In Hong Kong 73.8% of respondents reported that they would wear a mask in public venues and 88.3% reported that they would be fully compliant with any quarantine policies. 10 Factors infl uencing uptake of protective behaviors were reported in many studies of SARS, and avian infl uenza, with increased compliance often being associated with higher risk perception and anxiety, 16 concern for self/family/children, 10, 16 perceived susceptibility, 17, 18 greater knowledge regarding transmission, 13 and perceived effectiveness of protective measures. 10 With regard to demographic factors, increased adherence to protective behaviors is often associated with older age groups, female gender, higher levels of education, 10, 16 and being in full time employment. 10 Studies specifi cally concerning willingness to receive vaccination in the event of a future outbreak of H5N1/avian infl uenza or in relation to SARS have not been found in Australia or other countries not previously affected by SARS or H5N1, However, Australian data relating to population willingness to receive seasonal infl uenza exists, and suggests that for those in infl uenza risk groups (over 65s, and 40s-64s meeting established research council (NH&MRC) 'at risk' criteria) infl uenza vaccination uptake is infl uenced by perceptions of risk, self rated health status and beliefs about the effi cacy of the vaccination. 19 Data from Hong Kong indicate that rates of seasonal infl uenza vaccination have increased since SARS and H5N1 and vaccination uptake behavior was linked to higher perceived likelihood of a large local outbreak of H5N1 in the future and perceptions that any future outbreak would be worse than SARS had been. 17 The purpose of the current study was to gather the fi rst baseline Australian data on public levels of willingness to comply with vaccination, isolation, and face mask wearing in the event of an infl uenza pandemic in Australia, and to assess a selection of sociodemographic, health, and threat perception factors that might infl uence such decisions.",

Factors associated with lower levels of willingness to isolate oneself were speaking a language other than English at home, being younger and having never been married. These fi ndings are potentially important for those involved in disease or emergency response, and with further research to identify reasons for this lack of willingness to isolate, may suggest a need for tailored communication or support strategies. It is possible that these groups rely more on social contact outside of the household and, hence, would be less willing to forfeit this in the event of a pandemic. Indications in the data show that immigrants (those not born in Australia) and those who speak a language other than English at home may be less willing to isolate themselves.",

However, it is the only behaviour studied here that is also associated with respondents' perceived likelihood of pandemic infl uenza occurring. Mask wearing, overall, is the behavior that people reported being least willing to comply with and it is possible that, for this reason, higher threat perception (concern and likelihood of pandemic) is required to drive compliance with this behavior. Younger people (16-24 and 25-34) are generally less willing to wear face masks, and only those with university qualifi cations or equivalent are signifi cantly more likely to be willing to wear face masks. In the event of a pandemic it is likely that the public will be required to wear masks, especially in health care facilities, in public places, and in situations where individuals need to interface with the public, eg, certain critical occupations such as banking, welfare, post/delivery, fuel service, and shops. The mediating effect of increased threat perception in the event of actual pandemic is likely to raise compliance but data suggest that certain sectors of the general population are likely to remain resistant to mask wearing and require further encouragement, communication strategies, and education.",

This fi nding suggests that the concomitant concern/risk that would come with an actual pandemic might be suffi cient to increase public health compliance to required levels, as noted in data from Hong Kong during SARS. 18 An alternative, more active approach might include the use of risk communication messages before a pandemic occurs, or in the pre-pandemic/increased alert stages. Although the adoption of such an approach might seem compelling, Middaugh in a recent paper 23 warns about the unintended consequences of raising concern over 'frightening' the public about germs, increasing concern about seasonal infl uenza (to increase take-up of vaccination) and emphasizing the role of social distancing. He argues that such approaches cause societal estrangement and frighten health care workers, fi rst responders, and those who would have contact with the public in the event of a pandemic.",

The main limitation is that the questions are based on a hypothetical, anticipated threat to an infl uenza pandemic-naive population and, hence, serve as only a general indication of the likely response of the public to such an event. In addition, the analysis has focused on the use of dichotomized responses and has not included those who were less willing, but still may have complied with the behaviors investigated in the study. As noted, reported willingness to comply with these behaviors is likely to be mediated by a number of factors, and it is probable that only a subset of these have been identifi ed in this study. The role of threat perception, anxiety, societal response (the compliance of others), media, and factors directly related to the course of the pandemic are all likely to infl uence public response.",
