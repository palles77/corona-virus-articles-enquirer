The sensitivity of rRT-PCR assays designed for each gene segment ranged from 0.08 to 0.8 EID 50 (50% of Egg Infectious Dose) per reaction for the detection of undesired genes in LV1 and from 0.1 to 1 EID 50 per reaction for the detection of undesired genes in LV2B. No undesired genes were detected either before or after five passages of LV1 or LV2B in eggs. The complete genome sequencing of LV1 and LV2B confirmed the results of rRT-PCR, demonstrating the utility of the new rRT-PCR assays to provide the evidence for the homogeneity of the prepared vaccine candidate.",

Vaccination is an important intervention for preventing influenza and reducing the public health impact of epidemics and pandemics (Ambrose et al., 2011; Osterholm et al., 2012) . Global Pandemic Influenza Action Plan to increase vaccine supply was initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in November of 2006 and refined further in 2011. One of the objectives was to expand vaccine production capacity by building new production facilities to strengthen pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The Institute of Experimental Medicine (IEM, St Petersburg, Russia) contributed to the Global Pandemic Influenza Action Plan by establishing an agreement with the WHO to supply Russian LAIV reassortant viruses to manufacturers in developing countries who could then provide influenza vaccines to the public (Rudenko et al., 2011) . The increased international demand of Russian LAIV reassortant viruses prompted the WHO and IEM to establish a back-up facility at the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Influenza Division to prepare and incorporate quality assessment of LAIV reassortants for international use.",

Two major types of influenza vaccines are licensed for human use: trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and LAIV. LAIV is administered intranasally which mimics natural infection and protects against the disease caused by the influenza viruses (Aleksandrova, 1977; Cox et al., 2004; Maassab and DeBorde, 1985) . The development of LAIV became possible with the generation of cold-adapted (ca) type A and B Master Donor Viruses (MDVs). Both MDVs have three phenotypes: (1) allow efficient viral replication at 25 \u00b0C and 33 \u00b0C (ca), (2) restrict replication at temperatures above 39 \u00b0C (temperature-sensitive, ts), and (3) do not cause classical influenza-like illness and are restricted in replication in the lower respiratory tract (attenuated, att) (Maassab and Bryant, 1999; Murphy and Coelingh, 2002; Rudenko et al., 1996) . LAIV are 6:2 reassortant viruses that contain the HA and NA gene segments from circulating influenza viruses to induce protective immune responses and the six internal gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS) from MDVs provide ca, ts and att phenotypes of LAIV. In addition to conferring the ts and ca phenotypes, MDV also allows the reassortant viruses to replicate efficiently in embryonated chicken eggs as all licensed LAIVs are currently produced in embryonated chicken eggs.",

A challenge for the limiting dilution cloning in eggs method is the possibility of obtaining an impure vaccine candidate. According to WHO guidelines for generation and characterization of LAIV candidates, biological materials for vaccine production, such as seed viruses and intermediates should be fully and up-to-date characterized to assure the quality, safety, and efficacy of LAIV for intranasal administration (WHO, 2009 ). The safety concerns necessitate accurate, sensitive and reliable methods to characterize the quality of LAIV seed candidates generated by classical reassortment. The current techniques for identity/homogeneity testing of reassortant influenza vaccines are the ones used for genotyping -analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism of viral genes amplified by RT-PCR (Fulvini et al., 2011; Klimov and Cox, 1995; Sakamoto et al., 1996) , multiplex RT-PCR (Ha et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2010) and Sanger sequencing -all are based on conventional RT-PCR method. In an attempt to provide better quality control of LAIV candidate viruses and to ensure the uniform composition of the A/Victoria/ 361/2011(H3N2)-CDC-LV1 (LV1) and B/Texas/06/2011-CDC-LV2B (LV2B) reassortants (designated as Master Virus Seed, MVS), real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to confirm the lack of any genetic material of undesired origin in the reassortant viruses.",

Five eggs were infected with each virus dilution and incubated at 32 \u00b0C for 48 h for influenza A virus and 72 h for influenza B virus.

            "text": "LAIV candidates for the 2012-2013 seasons, A/Victoria/361/2011-CDC-LV1 (LV1) and B/ Texas/06/2011-CDC-LV2B (LV2B) were created by the classical viral reassortment method. The genetic identity of vaccine candidate viruses was demonstrated by pyrosequencing assay at the stage of vaccine candidate selection. The pyrosequencing approach as well as most of the other current techniques used for genotyping and screening of reassortant influenza viruses are based on conventional RT-PCR technique (Fulvini et al., 2011; Ha et al., 2006; Kiseleva et al., 2011; Klimov and Cox, 1995; Lee et al., 2010; Sakamoto et al., 1996) . The sensitivity of the RT-PCR was shown to be at least log 10 lower compared to rRT-PCR technique in a number of reports (Chen et al., 2007; Emery et al., 2004; Kaida et al., 2008; Rodrigues et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2007) . For example, the rRT-PCR H5 gene assay designed for avian influenza reproducibly determined lowest amount of viral RNA corresponding 0.05 EID 50 per reaction in contrast to detection limit of 3 EID 50 in cnRT-PCR (Chen et al., 2007) . Real time RT-PCR is currently recognized as the most sensitive and reliable technique for detection and identification of viral subpopulations in diagnostics. The highest sensitivity of rRT-PCR assays was demonstrated for the detection of influenza viruses of different origin and composition (Chen et al., 2007; Monne et al., 2008; Nakauchi et al., 2011; Shu et al., 2011) . The rRT-PCR assays reported for detection of subtype H5, H7, and H9 avian influenza viruses had sensitivity from 0.5 to 2.74 EID 50 /per reaction (Monne et al., 2008) . The sensitivity of rRT-PCR assays developed in the present study was shown to range from 0.08 to 0.8 EID 50 per reaction for the detection of undesired genes in LV1 and from 0.1 to 1 EID 50 /reaction for the detection of undesired genes in LV2B. Therefore, primer/probe sets used in the current study allowed genome detection as sensitive as those reported in other studies using rRT-PCR assays (Chen et al., 2007; Monne et al., 2008; Spackman et al., 2002; Wise et al., 2004) . However, it should be noted that although the designed primers and probes for MDVs are expected to work for the next MDV-wt reassortment pairs, the primer and probes sequences for next selected for vaccine wt virus must be checked and updated regularly and the limit of detection should be identified using that specific wt RNA.",

It is important to determine that no other genetic material is present in the MVS which could be assured by rRT-PCR homogeneity test. In the present study, the homogeneity of the original and passaged LV1 and LV2B viruses were analyzed by rRT-PCR and genetic stability was confirmed by complete sequencing of all gene segments. The rRT-PCR data demonstrate that neither of the reassortant viruses contained genetic material from internal genes of wt parental viruses or HA and NA genes of MDV origin with a high sensitivity levels of assays (Table 5 ). The rRT-PCR results were confirmed by sequencing analysis. No nucleotide change was found in sequences of passaged five times LV1 or LV2B viruses indicating the high level of genetic stability. The data obtained in the present study are in good agreement with the previous study on genetic stability of FluMist/CAIV-T vaccine, which demonstrated a remarkable sequence identity for all vaccine intermediates throughout the manufacturing process (Buonagurio et al., 2006) The fact that no undesired genes were detected after five passages of MVS by rRT-PCR proves that the developed rRT-PCR assays were adequate and sufficient to provide the evidence for the homogeneity of the prepared vaccine candidate. In conclusion, both rRT-PCR and sequencing results provide conclusive safety controls for further manufacturing processing of MVS. The real-time RT-PCR assays developed in the present study are in compliance with WHO recommendations to provide further quality control steps to ensure safe use of LAIV.
