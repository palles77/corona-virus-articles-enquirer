            "text": "Viral respiratory illnesses associated with wheezing are extremely common during early life, and remain a frequent cause of morbidity and hospitalization in young children [1] . While many children who wheeze with respiratory viruses during infancy outgrow the problem, most children with asthma and reductions in lung function at school age began wheezing during the first several years of life [2] . Whether symptomatic viral infections of the lower respiratory tract are causal in asthma development or simply identify predisposed children remains a controversial issue. Wheezing illnesses caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), particularly those severe enough to lead to hospitalization, have historically been associated with an increased risk of asthma at school age [3, 4] . However, with the development of molecular diagnostics, human rhinovirus (HRV) wheezing illnesses have been recognized more recently as a stronger predictor of school-age asthma than RSV [5, 6] . In this chapter, we will review the impact of virus infections during early life, focusing primarily on RSV and HRV, and their potential roles in asthma inception.",

A number of environmental factors have been linked to risk of wheezing illnesses during early life. The Tucson Children's Respiratory Study (TCRS), a prospective unselected birth cohort, identified a number of risk factors for wheezing during early childhood. Older siblings and daycare, both associated with increased exposure to respiratory viruses, and tobacco smoke exposure were all associated with increased risk for early life wheezing illnesses, whereas breastfeeding was protective [7] .",

A large twin registry in Denmark was utilized to assess the relationships between severe RSV illness and asthma development [19, 20] . The data from this study suggests that severe RSV illnesses and asthma share a common predisposition, and while RSV can lead to short-term recurrent wheeze, it is not causal in long-term asthma development. Similarly, while the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study identified RSV wheezing illnesses during the first 3 years of life as an independent risk factor for wheezing at 6 years of age, this relationship weakened over time and was no longer significant by 13 years of age [3] . Thus, early RSV wheeze may lead to a recurrent wheeze phenotype, but it is less commonly associated with life-long asthma.

Children who wheezed with HRV during the first year of life had about a threefold risk of having asthma at age six years. HRV wheezing during the second year of life was associated with a more pronounced, about a seven-fold, increase in asthma risk, while wheezing with HRV infection during the third year of life was associated with a dramatic (OR about 32) increase in asthma at school age. Remarkably, nearly 90% of children who wheezed with HRV during the third year of life had asthma when they reached school age [6] .

Nonetheless, a few studies may shed some light on the inflammatory processes that occur in these children. Krawiec and colleagues performed bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on children, median age 15 months, with recurrent wheezing, in addition to a group of healthy controls. These studies demonstrated that children with persistent wheezing had increased inflammatory cells and markers of inflammation compared to healthy controls, but did not have the characteristic eosinophil predominance seen in older children and adults with asthma [27] . Similarly, Saglani and colleagues performed bronchoscopy and biopsy in children, median age 12 months, with persistent wheezing, and were unable to demonstrate either eosinophilic inflammation or reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickening, both common features of asthma seen in older children and adults [28] . In contrast, in further studies of older children with recurrent wheezing, median age 29 months, they were able to demonstrate the presence of both eosinophilic inflammation and RBM thickening when compared to a group of controls. This suggests that inflammatory changes and remodeling typical of asthma develop between one and three years of age in recurrent wheezing children, and highlights the potential importance of environmental exposures, such as virus infections, during this period.",

Importantly, the authors also found increased VEGF in nasal lavage fluid of volunteers with natural HRV infections. In another epithelial cell model, Zhu and colleagues found that HRV infection led to TLR-3-dependent mucin production and up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor, a prominent component of epithelial repair [31] . Finally, epithelial cell gene expression studies have identified a number of potential novel pathways involved in the response to HRV infection. Proud and colleagues found that HRV infection led to up-regulation of many genes, perhaps most notably in interferon and airway repair and remodeling pathways [32] . Bochkov and colleagues similarly demonstrated that HRV infection led to up-regulation of a number genes involved in interferon and airway remodeling pathways [33] . Notably, in this study, differences between asthmatics and controls were similar prior to and during HRV infection. In sum, while data that demonstrates causality of HRV infection in asthma inception is limited, a number of plausible mechanisms by which recurrent HRV infection could lead to airway damage and remodeling have been identified, and are deserving of further study.",

In this study, the decreased interferon-\u03b2 response was associated with both delayed apoptosis and increased viral replication, which was overcome with the addition of exogenous interferon-\u03b2 [40] . Additionally, lower levels of interferon-\u03b1, another type I interferon, responses have been demonstrated in the peripheral blood of both children [41] and adults [42] with atopic asthma versus non-atopic controls. Finally, Contoli and colleagues found that bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages from atopic asthmatics had impaired interferon-\u03bb, a type III interferon, responses to human rhinovirus infection, and that these responses correlated with FEV 1 decline during exacerbations [43] . While this collection of studies has identified defects in interferon pathways as potential important contributors to early childhood wheezing and asthma, unfortunately, attempts to replicate these findings have not always been successful. Two recent studies found no difference in epithelial cell responses between asthmatics and controls [33, 44] .",

            "text": "Another important component of the innate immune response to virus infection is barrier function. Barrier function of the skin is important in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, with mutations in filaggrin identified in a number of patients with severe atopic dermatitis [45] . Interestingly, ongoing allergic inflammation may lead to a local or acquired filaggrin deficit [46] . Several studies have highlighted how disruption of the airway epithelium could alter host antiviral responses and severity of lower respiratory illnesses. In fact, mutations in filaggrin have been identified as a risk factor for asthma and asthma exacerbations in children [47, 48] . A unique model of airway injury took this observation one step further in demonstrating the potential consequences of impairment in airway barrier function through physical injury. Jakiela and colleagues, utilizing in vitro epithelial cell culture, showed that mechanical injury to the epithelia resulted in increased replication of HRV [49] . This is a potential mechanism by which various host factors or environmental exposures such as allergen, tobacco smoke, and previous virus infection, could lead to impairment in barrier function, increased viral replication, and more severe lower respiratory illnesses.",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses are a major cause of morbidity in young children. Wheezing illnesses caused by viruses during early life are the most common initial presentation of childhood asthma. Recent evidence suggests that wheezing with HRV is the most robust predictor of subsequent asthma. However, whether HRV is causal in asthma inception is an open question. Plausible mechanisms of causality have been identified, but are in need of further study. The most definitive way to prove causality would be to prevent HRV infection and demonstrate reductions in asthma development, but vaccines for HRV have proven elusive, in part due to the nearly 150 existing species of HRV. Studies attempting to identify more virulent or 'asthmagenic' forms of HRV are ongoing and could prove very informative. Novel preventive and therapeutic strategies are sorely needed to prevent or interrupt the progression from virusinduced wheezing to persistent asthma. Immunol Allergy Clin North Am.
