Analysis of the full-length genome sequence showed that this virus is closely related to bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus and is a member of the genus Bocavirus, subfamily Parvovirinae, family Parvoviridae. This virus has been provisionally named human Bocavirus (HBoV) (2) . HBoV in respiratory samples from Australian children was also recently reported (3). Involvement of this new virus in respiratory tract diseases merits further investigation. We have therefore retrospectively tested for HBoV nasopharyngeal samples collected from children <5 years of age hospitalized with respiratory tract disease.",

Samples were also placed on MRC5 cell monolayers for virus isolation and tested for human metapneumovirus by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Nucleic acids were extracted from samples, stored at -80\u00b0C, and tested for HBoV DNA by PCR with primers specific for the predicted NP1 gene as previously described (2) . The expect-ed product size was 354 bp. In each experiment, a negative control was included, and positive samples were confirmed by analyzing a second sample. Amplification specificity was verified by sequencing.",

Bronchiolitis was the major diagnosis. Dyspnea, respiratory distress, and cough were the most common respiratory symptoms observed.

Molecular analysis techniques suggest that many ESBLs are derived from mutations in TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 \u03b2-lactamases and that these ESBLs can hydrolyze the extended-spectrum cephalosporins (particularly ceftazidime) and aztreonam (1). Members of a new group of ESBLs have been recently identified (1). Among them, CTX-M-type ESBLs are rapidly expanding and are derived from chromosomal class A \u03b2-lactamases of Kluyvera spp. (1, 2) . The CTX-M enzymes are not related to TEM or SHV enzymes, as they share only 40% identity with these ESBLs (2) .These ESBLS are usually characterized by a higher level of resistance to cefotaxime than ceftazidime, except for CTX-M-19 (2) . Most organisms that harbor ESBLs are also resistant to other classes of antimicrobial drugs, such as aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines (1, 2) .",
