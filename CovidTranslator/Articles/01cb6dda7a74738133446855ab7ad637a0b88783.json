Presumably, PRRSV infection enhances PCV2 replication as a result of modulation of host immunity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate PCV2 replication and pathogenesis in pigs vaccinated with a PRRS modified live virus (MLV) vaccine and subsequently challenged with a combination of PRRSV and PCV2. During the early postchallenge period, the number of pigs with PRRSV-associated clinical signs was decreased, and average daily gain (ADG) was increased, in the vaccinated group, demonstrating the protective effect of PRRS vaccination. However, during the later postchallenge period, more pigs in the vaccinated group showed increased PCV2 viremia, decreased ADG, increased PCVAD clinical signs, and increased mortality. In this disease model, the early benefits of PRRSV vaccination were outweighed by the later amplification of PCVAD.",

Vaccination with a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) modified live virus vaccine followed by challenge with PRRS virus and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) protects against PRRS but enhances PCV2 replication and pathogenesis compared to results for nonvaccinated cochallenged controls. Biosafety Committees. The study was conducted as part of the evaluation of a previously described genomic marker, WUR (17). The population used in this study was composed of pigs with two genotypes: 50% had WUR genotype AA, and 50% had WUR genotype AB or BB. The AB and BB genotypes were predicted to have beneficial effects on the response to PRRSV infection. Both the vaccine group and the nonvaccine group were balanced according to WUR genotype; therefore, WUR was not a factor in the comparison of the outcomes of the vaccine and nonvaccine groups. Three-week-old barrows (n \u03ed 226; average age, 19.4 \u03ee 1.8 days) were obtained from a high-health commercial source negative for PRRSV. While the pigs were derived from a sow herd previously vaccinated with a PCV2 capsid subunit vaccine, the piglets were not vaccinated for PCV2 and were obtained after weaning without regard to maternal antibody levels. All pigs were housed in two environmentally controlled rooms at the Kansas State University Large Animal Research Center and were maintained under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Rooms were chemically disinfected, cleaned with a high-heat pressure washer, and gas decontaminated with vaporized hydrogen peroxide prior to use. Both rooms were empty for at least 19 days prior to the start of the study. Pigs were housed in 20 pens, each with an area of 144 ft 2 , with 11 to 12 pigs per pen. Pigs were given access to food and water ad libitum.",

A total of 226 pigs were randomly allocated to two identical rooms by use of a random number assignment protocol and were housed in groups of 11 to 12 pigs per pen. After acclimation for 4 days, 115 pigs in one room were vaccinated with a 2-ml dose of a commercial PRRS MLV vaccine (Ingelvac PRRS MLV; Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health; GenBank accession no. AF159149) administered intramuscularly according to the vaccine label instructions. At 28 days postvaccination (dpv), all pigs in both rooms were challenged with a combination of PRRSV and PCV2b. Individual body weights were determined on days \u03ea3, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, and 70 postvaccination. Blood samples were collected from all pigs at 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days postinfection (dpi). Blood was also collected from the vaccinated group at 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, and 21 dpv. At 11 dpi, 10 vaccinated and 10 nonvaccinated pigs were randomly selected for humane euthanasia, and complete necropsies were performed. Between days 32 and 42 postinfection, 11 pigs showing clinical signs of PCVAD and 7 pigs not showing such signs were humanely euthanized, and complete necropsies were performed. These pigs were selected on the basis of clinical disease without regard to vaccine status.",

The PRRSV and PCV2b isolates used to prepare the inoculum were originally derived from the lymph node of a pig with severe PMWS, as described previously (13, 14) . PRRSV (isolate KS62; GenBank accession no. KM035803) was isolated by propagation on MARC-145 cells. The PRRSV component of the challenge inoculum, KS62, shared 88.06% identity with the MLV (GenBank accession no. AF159149) at the peptide sequence level of GP5. Since wild-type PCV2b (GenBank accession no. JQ692110) does not propagate to high levels in cell culture, we took advantage of the heat stability of PCV2 to make a virus preparation from a lymph node suspension enriched for PCV2. The suspension was heat treated at 55\u00b0C for 30 min to remove PRRSV, bacteria, and other heat-labile agents. The treated homogenate was recombined with the isolated PRRSV in order to infect cesarean-derived, colostrumdeprived (CD/CD) pigs. A combination lung/lymph node homogenate was prepared from the CD/CD pigs, and PRRSV and PCV2 were isolated from the homogenate by the methods described above. Analysis of the heat-treated preparation for common agents showed that the preparation was negative for most heat-stable agents, such as parvovirus, but still positive for torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) and porcine oncovirus (PCOV), which are ubiquitous.",

For the past 20 years, PRRSV has remained the most costly disease affecting swine production worldwide (5) . PRRSV infection contributes to a number of immunological outcomes that increase the susceptibility of the host to secondary infections by primary and secondary pathogens (6) (7) (8) . PRRSV is frequently isolated along with PCV2 (9) and is one of the major cofactors linked with increasing PCV2 replication and pathogenesis (10) (11) (12) . Previous work by us and others has shown that a principal contribution of PRRSV is to increase PCV2 viremia (13) . Increased PCV2 replication is likely the result of immune stimulation that results in more PCV2-permissive cells combined with PRRSV-induced immunomodulation. The complex etiology of PCVAD, including the role of PRRSV infection, has yet to be fully understood. In an extensive body of work, we identified the aberrant recognition of a nonneutralizing decoy epitope on the PCV2 capsid protein (CP) as a contributing factor in PCVAD immunopathogenesis. Natural PCV2 infection of a population produces a mixture of pigs that recognize the decoy and neutralizing epitopes, which may explain why only a subpopulation of infected pigs goes on to develop PCVAD (13) (14) (15) .",

For consistency, each plate contained Tetracore quantification standards and control sets for use with EZ-PRRSV MPX 4.0 RT-PCR reagents. All PCRs were carried out on a CFX96 Touch real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) in a 96-well format using the recommended cycling parameters. PCV2 DNA was quantified using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad). The forward and reverse PCR primers were 5=-AATGCAGAGGCGTGATTGGA-3= and 5=-CCAGTATGTGGT TTCCGGGT-3=, respectively. The primers were used at a final concentration of 300 M. Nuclease-free water was used to bring the master mix volume to 18 l per reaction. The addition of 2 l of template nucleic acid brought the final reaction volume for each sample to 20 l. Standard curves and positive and negative controls were included on each plate. Plasmid DNA was used for the PCV2 standard curve and positive-control template. DNA inserted into the plasmid was obtained from a field strain of PCV2 (PCV2b 321/393). Plasmid DNA was isolated by using the PureYield Plasmid Miniprep system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA for the standard curve was quantified using a NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer. The standard curve was produced by diluting the purified plasmid DNA 1:1,000 in nuclease-free water, followed by five serial 1:10 dilutions in nuclease-free water. The final standard curve contained 6 points ranging from 10 7 to 10 2 copies of template DNA, which produced threshold crossing values between 15 and 33 cycles. Standard curves were run in duplicate with nuclease-free water as a negative control. The PCV2 PCR was carried out on a CFX96 Touch real-time PCR detection system using the following settings: activation at 98\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 5 s and annealing/extension at 60\u00b0C for 10 s. The melting curve was performed between 65 and 95\u00b0C using 0.5\u00b0C increments.

Even though blue ear is not pathognomonic for PRRS, it often coincides with acute infection. A representative example of a pig with blue ear is shown in Fig. 3 . No blue ear was observed among either the vaccinated or the nonvaccinated pigs prior to challenge. However, during the postchallenge period, 64 of all 226 pigs (28.3%) were documented as having blue ear on one or more days. As shown in Fig. 4A , the percentage of pigs with blue ear peaked between 8 and 17 dpi, which corresponded to the peak in PRRS viremia (compare Fig. 2A) . Overall, 19% of vaccinated pigs (22/115) and 38% of nonvaccinated pigs (42/111) were documented with blue ear. A nonvaccinated pig was 3.02 times (95% CI, 1.7, 5.9) more likely to develop blue ear than a vaccinated pig (P \u03ed 0.001). The total numbers of days with blue ear were 65 and 201 for the vaccine and nonvaccine groups, respectively. The reduction in the number of pigs with blue ear in the vaccine group is consistent with a beneficial effect of the PRRS MLV.",

In previous work, we identified the presence of antibodies against a decoy epitope in the capsid protein of PCV2, CP(160 -180), correlated with PCVAD (13-15). The presence of an anti-CP(160 -180) response is associated with the absence of PCV2 neutralizing activity in serum. Pigs vaccinated for PCV2 and protected from disease produce little anti-CP(160 -180) activity and preferentially recognize a larger epitope, CP . Pigs that are naturally infected with PCV2 show a mixture of the two antibody responses. As a means to standardize results across plates, the anti-PCV2 antibody responses for the vaccine and nonvaccine groups were presented as CP(160 -233)/CP(43-233) ratios. The higher the ratio, the more the immune response is skewed toward the recognition of the decoy epitope. The results, presented in Fig. 7 , showed a significant (P \u03ed 0.0006) difference between the CP(160 -233)/CP(43-233) mean ratios: 0.85 for non- vaccinated pigs versus 0.97 for vaccinated pigs. Exclusion of the 32 pigs that showed the presence of PCV2 nucleic acid at the time of challenge changed the ratios but did not affect the conclusion; CP(160 -233)/CP(43-233) mean ratios were 0.92 for nonvaccinated pigs (n \u03ed 61) and 0.98 for vaccinated pigs (n \u03ed 72) (P \u03ed 0.03). As discussed above, previous work showed that pigs with low CP(160 -233)/CP(43-233) ratios are protected from disease. Therefore, nonvaccinated pigs with ratios of \u03fd0.5 (n \u03ed 13) were compared to nonvaccinated pigs with PCV2 antibody ratios of \u03fe0.5 (n \u03ed 68). Pigs with antibody ratios of \u03fd0.5 had significantly lower levels of circulating PCV2 in the serum at 21 (P \u03ed 0.0001), 28 (P \u03ed 0.0008), 35 (P \u03ed 0.007), and 42 (P \u03ed 0.03) dpi than pigs with higher ratios.

The second phase covered the period of acute PRRSV infection. At 1 week after virus challenge, mean ADG was significantly increased for the vaccine group. ADG remained higher for the vaccine group in the second week postchallenge, but the difference was not signif-icant. The improved ADG for the vaccinated pigs likely resulted from the positive effect of vaccination in reducing PRRS-associated clinical signs and virus load ( Fig. 2A and 4A ). The third phase covered the period from the onset of PCVAD, beginning at about 3 weeks after virus challenge, to the end of the study. During this phase, ADG was lower in the vaccinated group at every time point, with significantly lower mean ADG values on week 6 after virus challenge. A significant decrease in ADG was also initially detected for vaccinated pigs on week 3 postchallenge; however, this difference was no longer significant after the 32 PCV2-positive pigs had been excluded (P \u03ed 0.08).

(35) found that colostrum-deprived, specificpathogen-free (SPF) pigs infected with PCV2 at the age of 5 weeks and administered the PRRS MLV 1 week later had greater amounts of PCV2 antigen in tissues and more-severe histologic lesions, characteristic of PMWS, than pigs infected with PCV2 alone. However, the pigs failed to exhibit clinical signs or gross lesions typical of PCVAD (35) . In contrast, Opriessnig et al. (36) evaluated the effects of PCV2 infection on the efficacy of the PRRS MLV in groups of 10 early-weaned SPF pigs. Pigs were inoculated with PCV2 at the age of 6 weeks, vaccinated with the PRRS MLV 2 weeks later, and then challenged with PRRSV at the age of 12 weeks. The group with PCV2 and the MLV exhibited lower ADG and more-severe lung lesions after PRRSV challenge than the group that was vaccinated and received a PRRSV challenge without PCV2. Because PCV2 was not detected in affected lungs by IHC, the authors attributed the lesions to PRRSV infection and further concluded that the effect of PCV2 was to reduce the efficacy of the PRRS MLV (36) . Park et al. (37) investigated the potential for the PRRS MLV to reduce PRRSV-associated amplification of PCV2 pathogenesis after coinfection with PRRSV and PCV2. Groups of 8 conventional pigs were subjected to a variety of treatments involving different combinations of the PRRS MLV, wild-type PRRSV, a PCV2 vaccine, and PCV2. Pigs were vaccinated with the PRRS MLV, a PCV2 subunit vaccine, or both and were then challenged, 4 weeks later, with PRRSV, PCV2, or both. The group that received the PRRS MLV followed by coinfection showed no differences in PCV2 viremia, PCV2-associated pathology, or the number of PCV2-positive cells in lymph nodes and lungs from the coinfected group that was not vaccinated with the PRRS MLV (37) . In contrast to our study, in which vaccination enhanced PCVAD, these authors found that coinfected pigs, with or without previous PRRS MLV vaccination, had similar PCV2 replication and pathogenesis.",

In contrast, an analysis of the effect of the PRRS MLV on farms affected by PCVAD in the United States found that farms incorporating the PRRS MLV have significantly lower levels of PCV2 viremia than nonvaccinating farms in the age group in which peak wasting disease occurred (39) . In that study, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to measure PCV2 in serum samples collected at different time points from 6 herds vaccinated with the PRRS MLV and 12 nonvaccinated herds.

In the current study, peak PCVAD occurred between 22 and 35 days after challenge with PRRSV and PCV2. Another important difference is the sizes of the experimental groups. Typically, the prevalence of clinically ill pigs on farms affected by PCVAD is only 2 to 25% (40) (41) (42) . In small groups of pigs, animals with clinical disease may not be apparent or present. The current study utilized more than 200 pigs, mimicking the environment found in the field and providing the depth of data required for the observation and quantification of low-percentage outcomes. PCVAD morbidity rates were 11.9% and 25.7% in nonvaccinated and vaccinated pigs, respectively. Therefore, PCVAD should be assessed by comparing mortality rates, clinical disease presentation, viremia, and weight gain in relatively large groups evaluated for several weeks after infection.",

Although these pigs were in the minority (14%), and group titers were relatively low (2.3 and 2.9 log 10 templates per PCR for vaccinated and nonvaccinated pigs, respectively), the presence of PCV2 prior to challenge had to be considered a possible factor in postchallenge response. This was especially true due to the difference between the proportions of PCV2-positive pigs in the two groups, despite randomized allocation of pigs and balanced genotypes. This difference was likely due to the failure of randomization to distribute PCV2-positive pigs equally across the two groups. Therefore, analyses were also completed after the 32 initially PCV2 positive pigs were excluded, and all conclusions of the study were confirmed. Regardless, this highlights the difficulty of eliminating PCV2 from the environment and also suggests that pigs should be balanced according to PCV2 status prior to challenge.",

In the current study, it is noteworthy that PCV2 viremia levels did not differ significantly between the vaccine and nonvaccine groups during peak PCVAD. However, the 39 clinically ill pigs did maintain significantly higher levels (P \u03fd 0.02) of circulating PCV2 during these later time points (21 and 35 dpi) (data not shown).

(44) found that PRRS MLV-vaccinated weaned pigs had lower ADG between 0 and 14 dpv than nonvaccinated pigs. While this effect on ADG was no longer apparent between 21 and 42 dpv, the vaccinated pigs maintained lighter weights overall (44) . We confirmed the negative effect of the PRRS MLV on ADG during the 28-day period prior to coinfection; significantly reduced ADG was observed during the third week after vaccination (Fig. 8) . The benefit of PRRSV vaccination was documented during the first 2 weeks after PCV2 and PRRSV challenge, when the MLV had a positive effect on ADG. Although vaccinated pigs in this study had increased ADG in the first 2 weeks postchallenge, this effect was quickly outweighed when ADG was decreased in the presence of PCVAD. Vaccination decreased ADG in both clinically affected pigs and pigs without clinical signs during the study period, demonstrating that poor growth performance may be a subclinical manifestation of PCVAD in apparently healthy pigs.",

            "text": "At least three mechanisms may be involved in the enhancement of PCVAD following PRRSV vaccination. First, the PRRS MLV may function to stimulate the immune system and increase the number of PCV2-permissive cells. As with wild-type viruses, lymphocytes undergo mitosis in response to vaccination with the PRRS MLV, thereby increasing the population of cells with the ability to support PCV2 replication. In addition, the vaccine likely stimulates PRRSV-specific lymphocyte populations that are restimulated after challenge with a wild-type PRRSV. Second, like wild-type PRRS viruses, the PRRS MLV may suppress innate immunity, thereby blocking anti-PCV2 responses. For example, PRRSV nonstructural proteins, such as nsp1 and nsp2, block the induction of interferon and response of cells to interferon (5) . Viral proteins such as nsp1\u2423 and nsp1\u2424 antagonize the type I interferon response by degrading key components needed for interferon gene expression and inhibiting interferon signaling pathways (45, 46) . Finally, the third mechanism is based on the possibility that the PRRS MLV may skew the immune response toward the production of nonneutralizing PCV2-specific antibodies.",

Since then, the disease has been effectively managed through the use of PCV2 vaccines (50) (51) (52) . Therefore, the negative effect of the MLV on PCV2 infection may not be relevant. However, there remain several countries in which PRRS MLV vaccination is in wide use, but in the absence of a comprehensive PCVAD vaccination program. Further, there is the potential for new and emerging PCV2 strains to escape current vaccine protection. Emerging PCV2 mutant strains have been documented in China (53) and more recently have been associated with PCVAD outbreaks in vaccinated herds in the United States and Korea (54, 55) . Overall, this study supports the notion that maintaining a successful PCV2 control program and assessing the risk of virulent PRRSV exposure is critical to weighing the benefits of the PRRS MLV.",
