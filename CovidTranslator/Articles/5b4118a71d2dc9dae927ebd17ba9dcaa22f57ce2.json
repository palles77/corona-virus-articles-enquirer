All of the 11 patients were healthy before developing SARS and none were smokers.

All patients were still alive during the study period. Twenty-seven CT scans were evaluated. At 84 months, 5 patients were still experiencing persistent dyspnea, 4 had cough, 2 had sputum production, and 2 experienced all 3 symptoms. The mean time from discharge to the first follow-up was 3 months (range, 2 to 4 months). showed GGO ( Figure 1 ) and 3 showed consolidation and GGO (60.0%) (Figure 2 ).

Nevertheless, the present study suggests that either the lung fibrosis is very slow to disappear after infection or that the CT abnormality is different from lung fibrosis induced by other pneumonia viruses. However, the results of the present study do not resolve this issue. With regard to the physical impairment that may accompany the abnormalities on thin-section CT, some previous studies suggest that the physical impairment after SARS persists for at least 12 months [11, 13] , while another study suggests only mild impairments at 5 years [14] . A study has shown that the immune response after SARS persists for at least 90 days [26] , but no data is available to determine exactly how long it persists and whether it could involve lungs as a long-term sequela. In our study, mild or moderate pulmonary function damage was still present in 81.8% of the patients at 7 years after SARS infection.",

In ARDS, although complete resolution of abnormalities may occur, the typical CT findings at the later stage are that of a coarse reticular pattern and GGO in the anterior part of the lungs [25, 27, 29] . In this setting, it is likely that GGO represents areas of fine fibrosis, which are observed on thin-section CT. Our study shows that the CT abnormalities of all patients had a diffuse distribution, which was similar that reported in a recent study by Masclans et al. [30] . Indeed, Masclans et al. [30] found that 76% of patients had abnormalities on high-resolution CT at 6 months after infection, and these abnormalities were typically areas of reticulation and GGO. Therefore, the distribution of thin-section abnormalities in our study seem to be different from those reported in some other studies [25, 27, 29] on late-stage ARDS.

During convalescence after SARS, GGO and intralobular and interlobular septal thickening were the main thin-section CT manifestations. From 6 months to 7 years after SARS, the predominant thinsection CT findings changed from GGO predominance to fine reticulation predominance, which probably represents the interstitial fibrotic proliferation recovery phase of diffuse alveolar damage. These abnormalities were consistent with the PFT.",

(C) At 84 months, GGO was greatly reduced and fine reticulation (intralobular and interlobular septal thickening) predominated (arrow). Patchy decreased attenuation was seen at 3-, 6-, and 84-month CT (triangle). Case 7, SARS survivor, male, 31 years old. (A) Chest radiography showed consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs in acute phase. (B) Six months later, GGO (triangle) and reticulation (arrow) were observed in both lungs. (C) Fine reticulation (arrow) still persisted but GGO could not be found at 84-month CT. Case 6, SARS survivor, female, 32 years old. (A) X-ray radiography showed a large consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs in acute phase. (B) Six months later, X-ray revealed GGO, septal thickening, and fine-mesh shadows (white arrow). Traction bronchiectasis was found in the left lower lobe. (C) At 84 months, GGO was reduced and interlobular thickening predominated. Traction bronchiectasis was still present.",
