The normal camelid leukon is characterized by a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio similar to dogs, cats, and horses, although the total white cell count tends to be high (8000-22,000 cells/ml). Platelets are small with azurophilic granules visible. The overall leukocytic responses to various insults or stimuli, as well as the gross character of bone marrow, are similar to those anticipated for other species. However, stress-induced leukocytosis and neutrophilia can be substantial, with white cell counts exceeding 40,000 cells/ml in some cases, including remarkable increases in band neutrophil counts.",

Normal range for CSF nucleated cell counts in some laboratories is as low as 0 to 3 cells/mL with lymphocytes predominating over fewer mononuclear cells and rare neutrophils. Total protein levels may range from 31.2 to 66.8 mg/dL and glucose concentrations are about 40% of the serum levels. 4 This sample may also permit visualization of some agents or be used for specific immune-based reactions, such as serology or latex agglutination. At necropsy, the collection of appropriate fresh samples of CNS tissue can provide a definitive diagnosis for a variety of infectious agents. It is strongly recommended that half of the brain plus suspected areas of spinal cord damage be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Histopathology, plus or minus IHC tests, can implicate many agents, provide the diagnosis for conditions such as polioencephalomalacia and cerebrovascular accidents, or confirm spinal cord damage for conditions such as cervical spine trauma or spondylosis. Disease of the peripheral nervous system seems to be uncommon in camelids, although histopathologic examination of nerves is sometimes rewarding, such as in cases of phrenic nerve neuropathy associated with diaphragmatic paralysis. 14 ",

The pregnant (almost always left horn), nonpregnant horn, and the body should be sampled, taking care to avoid the medial aspect of the horns, which is normally villus-poor. 40 General principles apply in terms of collecting abortion samples and the panel of samples collected for NWC cases at the authors' laboratory for an abortion screen is listed below:",
