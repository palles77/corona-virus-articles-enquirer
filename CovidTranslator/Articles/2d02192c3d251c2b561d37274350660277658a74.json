We used a set of gRNAs targeting repetitive elementsranging in target copy number from about 31 to 124,000 per cell. dBEs enabled survival after 5 large-scale base editing, allowing targeted mutations at up to ~13,200 and ~2610 loci in 293T and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), respectively, three orders of magnitude greater than previously recorded. These dBEs can overcome current on-target mutation and toxicity barriers that prevent cell survival after large-scale genome engineering.",

As a result, base editing has been broadly demonstrated with high efficiency in a range of species including human zygotes(21). A main motivation for developing BEs that avoid DSBs was to reduce the level of random vs. user-specified mutations caused by \"live\" Cas9, but the 3 in sensitive cell types such as hiPSCs (22) . However, whether these BEs can enable concurrent editing in human cells of sites as numerous as high copy TEs has not been explored but is particularly relevant to genome wide recoding efforts such as genome project write(23) (GP-write). To recode the human genome would require an estimated 4438 to 9811 precise modifications to remove all instances of one of the three stop codons(24). 5 ",

Alu and LINE-1 gRNAs were respectively 10 designed on the consensus sequences obtained from repeatmasker(25) (table S3) and on the consensus of 146 full-length sequences that encodes both functional ORF1 and ORF2 proteins(26). Finally, gRNAs against HERV-W, one subfamily of HERV, were designed on the consensus of putatively active retro-viruses(27) (table S3). We performed qPCRs of genomic DNA (gDNA) generated using consensus sequence-based primers to estimate the relative abundance in HEK 15 293T and PGP1 iPSCs ( Fig 1A) . The copy number of HERV-W, LINE-1, and Alu elements at the edited sites were respectively estimated at 36, 26,100 and 161,000 in HEK 293T; and 32, 19,000 and 124,000 in PGP1 iPSCs ( Fig 1B) . The TE's copy number in HEK 293T is higher than that in PGP1 since the former cells are largely triploid. We used a complementary bioinformatic approach as a second estimate of TE abundance by aligning our designed gRNAs to the human reference 20 genome (Fig 1C and fig. S1 ). An example of gRNA HL1gR4 targeting LINE-1 ORF2 is shown in Fig 1C. The total number of matches for HL1gR4 allowing 2 bp mismatches is 12,657, about half of our qPCR estimate, with the vast majority having an intact PAM (Fig 1D) . Since the reference sequence likely undercounts TEs because of the well-known problems of assembling, aligning, and mapping these sequences(28), we base our editing numbers based on the qPCR copy number 25 estimate.",

Three days after transfection, we observed indel frequencies at the LINE-1 expected targets ranging from 1.3% to 8.7%, corresponding to an average of respectively 339 and 2271 edits per haploid genome in the population (Fig. 2B) . In 35 accord with previous reports that this degree of genetic alteration is toxic, we confirmed ~7-fold increases in cell death and apoptosis through Propidium Iodide and Annexin V staining ( fig. S3) . A follow-up time-course experiment provided evidence that cells that undergo editing at hundreds of loci do not survive. Here we transfected pairs of LINE-1 gRNAs targeting the EN, RT or both (ENRT) domains. Using pairs of gRNAs causes large deletions (~170-800 bp) that can be detected 40 through gel visualization ( fig. S2A ). While samples from day two through five show clear editing with the expected deletion band sizes (Fig. 2C ), they were no longer detectable at days 9 and 14 indicating that mutated cells either died out as suggested by our previous cell death assay or were overgrown by wild type cells. Deep sequencing of expected dual gRNA deletion bands confirmed 4 the LINE-1 gRNA breakpoints ( fig. S2B) . While there were no visible bands at day 9 and 14, we repeated this experiment and attempted to isolate clones. After early indications of editing no clones had detectable mutations at day 12 and beyond (data not shown) suggesting that any significant level of indel activity at LINE-1 is toxic or limits growth and clonal isolation. Single cell analysis confirmed the bimodal editing frequency(16) with a mean deletion frequency of 5 47.1% ( fig. S4 ).",

When we transfected HEK 293T cells with nCBE3 and each of these gRNAs, we observed levels of deamination at each target locus that, although small (~0.05% -0.67%) exceeded levels in mock transfected control cells ( fig. S5) . These same CBE gRNAs could also be used with ABEs as they contain at least one adenine within their deamination 15 window. Above control levels of base editing were observed in genomic DNA in 4/5 gRNAs for both nCBE (fig. S5B) and nABE ( fig. S5C ). While nABE with HL1gR6 exhibited the highest editing efficiency (4.94% or ~1290 loci) three days after transfection, we used HL1gR4 going forward because it had the highest signal-to-background ratio among the more efficient gRNAs. The HL1gR4 target window also contained three efficiently-coedited C's, thus offering a clear 20 signal of directed mutation. In another experiment, an Alu targeting gRNA showed increased cell survival when using nCBE3 compared to Cas9 ( fig.

S11) . The mean single cell mutation frequency was reduced from 5.32% using nABE to 1.45% using dABE, indicating that disabling nicking resulted in a 3.67-fold decrease in editing efficiency at the day 2 timepoint (Fig. 4B ). Fourteen days after transfection, dBEs gained a marked advantage as compared to nBEs 40 in the total number of viable cells, and mutation frequency of single cells. There was a 14.8-fold increase in mean editing frequency among surviving live clones when using dABE compared to nABE (Fig. 4B) , and a 2.38-fold increase was observed for dCBE4-gam compared to nCBE4-gam. High base editing purity was observed for both ABEs, while CBEs generated non-intended bases at the target position. dCBEs significantly reduced the generation of such non-intended bases at 6 conversion was detected when targeting LINE-1 ( fig. S12 ). During the first three days of editing the dBEs had lower editing frequency when compared to nBEs but from day seven, dABE gained a significant edge over nABE (Fig. 4C ). Chromosomal integrity analysis was performed for clones edited at LINE-1 with nABE, dABE, nCBE4-gam, and dCBE4-gam. The karyotype results are shown in table S5 and show that 5 the top edited clones are not significantly different from control groups in terms of the total number of aberrations ( fig. S13-S14) . Further analysis in a karyotypically normal and stable cell line is required to fully assess chromosomal stability after large-scale genome editing. dABE allows the isolation of hiPSCs harboring up to 2600 edits 10 We next attempted the large-scale genome editing of PGP1 hiPSCs. The survival cocktail and single cell isolation time line is shown in Fig. 5A . The same experiment was conducted with two slight variations of the electroporation protocol in terms of total cells transfected and the total amount of DNA used (CS and PK conditions). Single cells were sorted and analyzed for target 15 nucleotide conversion frequency 18 hours post electroporation. The highest edited single cell had ~6.96% target A\u00e0G conversion or ~1320 sites (Fig. 5B ). In parallel live single cells were isolated and stable cell lines formed at 11 days post transfection. Colonies were analyzed for targeted LINE-1 A\u00e0G nucleotide conversion with a 1.30% and 0.96% mean editing frequency for CS and PK conditions respectively 18 hours after transfection (Fig. 5C ). At day 11, the median editing 20 efficiency of the CS live clones was higher than that of PK live clones in contrast to the value observed at the earlier time point, suggesting that lower initial editing efficiency may increase the viability of stably edited cell lines. The highest edited clone had a nucleotide conversion frequency of 13.75% which corresponds to 2600 sites genome wide, exceeding by three orders of magnitude the number of simultaneous edits previously recorded in iPSCs(29). The increased background 25 that occurs in single cell direct analysis Fig. 5B compared to isolation from an expanded colony Fig. 5C is likely due to the necessary over-amplification required to get enough genomic material from a single cell. Similar observations were made in previous experiments using 293T cells. All other previously tested DNA editors failed to produce any detectable edits at the LINE-1 locus in human iPSCs which are sensitive to even minor DNA damage(30) and rapidly deplete cells 30 transfected with Cas9 and TE gRNAs over time ( fig.

C321.\u0394A is a massively modified strain of E. coli MG1655 for which all instances of the Amber stop codon were 15 replaced(38). To attempt such a feat in the human genome will require the modification of 4438 Amber codons(24). We have shown that gene editors that do not cause double-or single-strand DNA breaks can generate a number of edits sufficient to theoretically achieve this genome recoding and pave the way towards making pan-virus resistant human cells. This could have commercial application towards cell-based production of monoclonal antibodies, recombinant 20 protein therapeutics, and synthetic meat production. As our study demonstrates, genome-wide disruption of high copy number repetitive elements is now possible and opens new opportunities to study the \"dark matter\" of the genome. CBEs that allow the generation of STOP codons within an open reading frame will be a great tool to probe at the functions of transposable elements, potentially turning observed associations with 25 physio-pathological phenotypes into causations.

First, when using HL1gR4, 35 CBE has three target nucleotides within its deamination window as compared to one for ABE, and as a consequence, CBE converts three times more nucleotide than ABE, potentially causing additional cytotoxicity. Second, when using CBE, the uracil N-glycosylase actively catalyzes the removal of the deaminated cytosine, generating several nicks genome-wide that promote DNA damage and potential cell death. The conversion of adenosine into inosine using ABE may not be 40 detected as efficiently by the DNA repair machinery, therefore increasing the viability of largescale editing. Random genome-wide off-target SNVs have been reported for CBEs that appear to be independent of gRNA binding sites(39). Thus, we anticipate the conditional modulation of DNA repair processes such as mismatch repair or base excision repair -that trigger downstream single-and double-strand breaks in the genome -to further improve the extent of dBEs' 8 Finally, since dBEs do not generate direct breaks in the genome, they decrease indel frequency to background and may not trigger DNA sensors such as p53, while retaining about 34% to 53% targeted nucleotide conversion frequencies as compared to their nBE counterparts. As a consequence, successful genetic modifications with dBEs may not enrich for pro-oncogenic cells that have disrupted DNA-damage guardians as has been reported for Cas9(40).
