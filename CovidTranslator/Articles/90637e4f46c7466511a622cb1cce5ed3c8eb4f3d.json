The BTV-3 TUN2016 spread in 2017 to Italy infecting a single 3-year-old female crossbred sheep belonging to a flock located in the municipality of Trapani, Sicily, which are 150 km distant from Peninsula of Cap Bon (7, 39, 40) and in 2018 in the Southern area of Sardinia causing numerous outbreaks (38) . Clinical signs in infected sheep included depression, fever, nasal discharge, submandibular edema, and crusted discharge around the nostrils. Four animals died because of the severity of infection (38) . In 2016, another BTV-3 strain closely related to TUN2016/Zarzis strain was detected in Egypt (38) .",

Except for the cattle farm number 14, where clinically healthy animals were tested for commercial purposes, BTV-3 was detected in samples of sick and dead cattle received from the beginning of September till the middle of December 2018. In two cattle farms (farms 8 and 15) with unusual mortality rates, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were also found in calves, respectively (Tables 3, 4) . In farm number 18, a post parturient BTV-3 positive adult cow was euthanized 2 days after showing hypersalivation, neural ketosis, and neck tense muscle. In addition, a one-year-old calf died after suffering from fever, fatigue, and conjunctival hyperemia. From blood sample of this calf, BEFV and BTV-3 were detected and BTV-3 was successfully isolated. In farm number 20, the clinical cases associated with BTV-3 detection included a calf which died after showing foamy salivation, nystagmus, hypothermia, and mucosal cyanosis and an adult cow showing post parturient ketosis, sharp blindness, endometritis, and tachycardia, which recovered after treatment with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. BTV-4 was also identified by RT-qPCR in tested samples. Similarly, BTV-3 and BTV-4 mixed infection was detected in a cow with bloody-purulent nasal discharge in farm number 21. Oppositely to previously described cases, no additional pathogens other than BTV-3 were found in farms number 13 and 19. In farm number 13, two adult pregnant cows showed recumbency before dying several days after appearance of clinical signs. No additional laboratory investigations were done for identifying the reason of the death. In farm 19, BTV-3 was detected in an adult cow which recovered after showing fever, indifference, inappetence, and sharp decrease in milk production. Field samples from ill cattle were not investigated for BTV-15 by RT-qPCR, due to absence of in-house or commercial RT-qPCR validated with currently circulating Israeli strains. Table S2) were almost full sequenced, when most segments of ISR-2396/2/17 strain were sequenced partially. Partial sequences of segment 2 (Seg-2) of all other Israeli BTV-3 isolates were also submitted to NCBI GenBank (accession numbers MH107823, MH107824, MN398282-MN398287) (https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/nucleotide/). Israeli BTV-3 strain sequences were also compared and data on nt and aa substitutions were summarized in the Table 5 . Due to very close relationship (99.45-99. 92% of nt identity in all genome segments) between BTV-3 strains isolated during 2017-2018 and ISR-2153/16 strain isolated in 2016, only sequences of the ISR-2153/16 strain were considered in the genetic analyses when nt sequences were compared to those of the global BTV strains ( Table 6) . First Israeli BTV-3 isolate (ISR-2019/13) was used as a prototype Israeli BTV-3 strain. Based on the data on number nt and aa substitutions, as well as on the identity with local or global BTV sequences, genome sequences were considered as homologous, or reassorted ( Table 5) .",

For the next several decades, no evidence of BTV-3 circulation was reported. BTV-3 circulation has been recently reported in Tunisia, Egypt and Italy. Even though detected either in goats or cattle (7, 38, 54) in these countries clinical signs associated to BTV-3 infection were observed and described in sheep only (7, 38, 39) . According to the retrospective findings of this study, during 2013-2017 BTV-3 outbreaks were restricted to Negev Desert area, in the southern district, while in 2018 it spread among most coastal and some central areas of Israel (Figure 1, Table 3 ). An additional difference between 2018 and 2013-2017 BTV-3 outbreaks was the exposure of Israeli goats and cattle in 2018 outbreaks. In this year, in fact, BTV-3 infection was occasionally associated with BT typical and atypical clinical signs, occurrence which was never observed before either in Israel or in the Mediterranean region (7, 38, 54) . These events may imply an increased infectivity and pathogenicity of the BTV-3 Israeli strains circulating in 2018 or/and their adaptation to the local vectors. However, because of the exiguous number of samples from diseased and clinically healthy animals received from the BTV-3 affected farms, it was hard to estimate the real exposure of ruminants and real effect BTV-3 infection on these animals. In Israeli goats and cattle, making any conclusion regarding the role of BTV-3 in causing illness and death was even harder due to involvement of different bacterial and viral agents in the clinical cases or to the absence of bacterial and toxicological investigations in some fatal cases. According to what observed in this survey, all Israeli BTV-3 strains were definitely capable of inducing classical manifestations of BT disease in sheep. These symptoms were more severe in case of BTV mixed infections (BTV-3 and BTV-4, BTV-6, or BTV-8). Notably, cases of acutely affected animal showing classical BT clinical signs were seen in one sheep farm during two-month period and confirmed by successful virus isolation. This fact illustrated presence of newly infected animals and probably infected vector during prolonged period during two seasons 2017 and 2018 (farms number 4 and 9, Table 4 ).",

These positive samples were further tested by BTV-4, BTV-8 and BTV-3 specific RT-qPCR. Of the 175 BTV positive samples, 25 were found positive for BTV-3 (15 whole blood samples from 14 cattle; from one cattle blood samples were collected twice), 8 from sheep and 2 from goats) and 32 for BTV-4 (13 from cattle, 18 from sheep and 1 from a goat). Additional 2 samples, one newborn calf and one placenta from case of abortion in sheep, were found positive to inhouse conventional RT-PCR unveiling Israeli BTV-4 strain in the both cases. One whole blood sample from sheep and 2 samples from cattle (one whole blood and one spleen samples), were contemporaneously positive for BTV-3 and BTV-4 in specific RT-qPCRs. All samples positive for BTV-4 were received between March and December 2018, while all samples positive for BTV-3 were received between August and December 2018.
