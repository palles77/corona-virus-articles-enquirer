Same polymorphism was recently found in outbred Wistar rat strain with b allele accounting for higher renal ACE, and provided a model for studying renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) response behind the innate high or low ACE conditions. Methods: We investigated the reaction of these alleles on chronic angiotensin II (AngII) infusion. Wistar rats were selected to breed male homozygotes for the b (WU-B) or l allele (WU-L) (n = 12). For each allele, one group (n = 6) received AngII infusion via an osmotic minipump (435 ng/kg/min) for 3 weeks. The other group (n = 6) served as a control. Results: WU-B had higher ACE activity at baseline then WU-L. Interestingly, baseline renal ACE2 expression and activity were higher in WU-L. AngII infusion induced the same increase in blood pressure in both genotypes, no proteinuria, but caused tubulo-interstitial renal damage with increased \u03b1-SMA and monocyte/macrophage influx only in WU-B (p < 0.05). Low ACE WU-L rats did not develop renal damage. Conclusion: AngII infusion causes proteinuria-independent renal damage only in rats with genetically predetermined high ACE while rats with low ACE seemed to be protected against the detrimental effect of AngII. Differences in renal ACE2, mirroring those in ACE, might be involved.",

In humans, the functional ACE I/D polymorphism accounts for half of the variance in plasma and renal ACE. 1 A similar polymorphism resulting in differential tissue Ace expression has been identified in the rat. 2 This Ace polymorphism was recently reported also within the outbred Wistar rat strain. Wistar rats homozygous for the b allele (WU-B) had higher renal ACE expression when compared with Wistar rats homozygous to the l allele (WU-L), providing a model for studying the RAAS under high or low ACE conditions and against the background of similar genetic heterogeneity and allele frequencies. 3 Increased renal ACE, in both rodents and human, has been thoroughly studied in connection with the progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In rats, high renal ACE has been associated with the increased susceptibility to hypertensive end organ renal damage. 10 In the model of chronic renal transplant failure, rats with high levels of intrarenal ACE mRNA and enzyme activity tended to develop more easily intraglomerular hypertension and more renal damage. 11 Furthermore, after adriamycininduced nephrosis, the differences in baseline renal ACE activity predicted the severity of damage, 12 while during nephrosis development, a positive correlation existed between renal ACE activity and proteinuria and glomerular and interstitial injury. 5 In addition, genetically predetermined high ACE has been suggested as a genetic risk marker in renal disease. 13, 14 The data on the whole are still conflicting and the exact role of predetermined high ACE in susceptibility to renal damage is still inconclusive. However, the response of the RAAS to various stimuli is probably affected by this ACE polymorphism.",

            "text": "Concurrently, with the expanding complexity of RAAS, ACE2 has emerged as a potential functional counterpart of ACE. The current premise is that the two enzymes stand in balance. [15] [16] [17] [18] It was shown that ACE2 is able to catalyze AngII with high efficiency, 19 hence preventing its accumulation. 20 Furthermore, increasing data provide evidence of reno-and cardio-protective properties of the ACE2 axis. [21] [22] [23] Activation of ACE2 axis was reported to lead to the decrease of oxidative stress and cell damage, 22 stimulates vasodilatation 24 and it was recently shown that supplementation of ACE2 attenuated diabetic kidney injury in mice. 23 The availability of a rat model that, with different kidney tissue ACE levels hypothetically has different RAAS symmetry, might give us an insight into the dynamics underlying the b/l Ace polymorphism. Enhanced conversion of AngI has been demonstrated in experimental setups in non-diabetic and diabetic humans, 25, 26 but considering the negative feedback within the RAAS, it is uncertain whether such acute experiments bear relevance to the susceptibility to chronic renal damage. An alternative hypothesis deserves consideration. Studying RAAS, it was shown that disease development could be followed by combined increase of renal ACE and decrease of ACE2, 27, 28 suggesting that genetically higher ACE may be associated with altered dynamics within the RAAS other than AngI conversion. If such effects downstream of ACE would be involved in the association to genetically higher ACE and susceptibility to renal damage, an increased susceptibility of the kidney to AngII-induced damage would be anticipated.",

In humans, the high ACE activity determined by the D ACE allele has been extensively studied in connection with the development and progression of renal and cardiovascular disease. While many studies show a connection, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] others have failed to establish it in the risk and disease prediction. 39, 40 The genetic variability as well as the multifactorial nature of cardio-renal diseases might account for these discrepancies. In rats, the significant effect of background ACE genotype on baseline renal hemodynamics was shown in a study by Liu et al. 10 where renal plasma flow and GFR were lower in high ACE Ren2.F than in low ACE Ren2.L rats. They also identified the Ace gene as a modifier of hypertensive end organ damage. 10 On the other hand, a genetic linkage has been found between the Ace gene and plasma ACE activity, but not between the Ace gene and blood pressure per se, 41 so it could be argued that possible detrimental effects of high ACE could be mediated by a more tissue-oriented pathway. Physiologically, ACE can regulate vascular reactivity and response to hypertension injury by altering the conversion of AngI and hence the concentration of AngII, which is known to have The ascending proteinuria line for WU-B was due to one rat with possible high AngII sensitivity (as shown in a separate box).

At baseline, higher ACE2 enzyme and activity seemed to have been combined with lower ACE activity in the kidney, and vice versa. It has been argued that the two enzymes may be counter-balancing each other in vivo. 17, 18 The ACE2 enzyme has a high substrate specificity for AngII by converting it into Ang(1-7). 19, 45 Endogenous ACE2 was suggested to have renoprotective properties in chronic kidney disease 24 while infusion of Ang(1-7) was recently shown to counteract AngII and reduces glomerulosclerosis in rats. 46 The reciprocal nature of these two enzymes found between WU-B and WU-L, leads us to question whether the baseline predominance of one could lead to different susceptibility to AngII-induced renal damage. Several factors could contribute to the elevated baseline ACE2 level in the WU-L group. It could be that the innate RAAS balance with high ACE (as in WU-B) favors the ACE/ AngII/AT1 axis while low innate ACE in the WU-L favors the ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas receptor axis in the kidney. In renal cortex of diabetic mice, it has been shown that there is a mismatch between ACE2 mRNA and protein levels, and proposed that ACE2 might be regulated at the posttranscriptional level, 47 while in renal epithelial cells AngII increased vascular epithelial growth factor protein expression without altering the gene expression levels. 48 Even though ACE2 activity was not increased in the WU-L after AngII infusion, the initial higher ACE2 baseline values might have been one of the beneficial factors in counteracting the renal effects of AngII.",
