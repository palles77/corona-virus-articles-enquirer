[1] [2] [3] [4] Structure-based methods are now routinely used in almost all stages of drug development, from target identification to lead optimization. [5] [6] [7] [8] Central to all structure-based discovery approaches is the knowledge of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the target protein or complex because the structure and dynamics of the target determine which ligands it binds. The 3D structures of the target proteins are best determined by experimental methods that yield solutions at atomic resolution, such as x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 9 Recent developments in the techniques of experimental structure determination have enhanced the applicability, accuracy, and speed of structural studies. 10, 11 Despite these advances, however, structural characterization of sequences remains an expensive and time-consuming task.",

Current statistics show that the structures available in the PDB account for only B1.5% of the sequences in the UniProt database. 13 Moreover, the rate of growth of the sequence information is more than twice that of the structures.

The speed, low cost, and relative accuracy of these computational methods have led to the use of predicted 3D structures in the drug discovery process. 24, 25 The other class of prediction methods, de novo or ab initio methods, attempts to predict the structure from sequence alone, without reliance on evolutionary relationships. However, despite recent progress in these methods, 26 especially for small proteins with fewer than 100 amino acid residues, comparative modeling remains the most reliable method of predicting the 3D structure of a protein, with an accuracy that can be comparable to a low-resolution, experimentally determined structure. 9",

The impact of structural genomics is illustrated by comparative modeling based on the structures determined by the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium. For each new structure, on average, 100 protein sequences without any prior structural characterization could be modeled at least at the level of the fold. 32 Thus, the structures of most proteins will eventually be predicted by computation, not determined by experiment.",

For the comparison of the model with the actual structure (filled circles), two C a atoms were considered equivalent if they belonged to the same residue and were within 3.5 \u00c5 of each other after least-squares superposition. For comparisons between the template structure and the actual target structure (triangles), two C a atoms were considered equivalent if they were within 3.5 \u00c5 of each other after alignment and rigid-body superposition. The difference between the model and the actual target structure is a combination of the targettemplate differences (green area) and the alignment errors (red area). The figure was constructed by calculating 3993 comparative models based on a single template of varying similarity to the targets.

The information in a multiple sequence alignment is most often encoded as either a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) 36, 40, 41 or as a hidden Markov model (HMM). 42, 43 In order to identify suitable templates for comparative modeling, the profile of the target sequence is used to search against a database of template sequences.

These methods have proven to include the most sensitive and accurate fold assignment and alignment protocols to date. 47, [50] [51] [52] Profile-profile methods detect B28% more relationships at the superfamily level and improve the alignment accuracy by 15-20% compared to profile-sequence methods. 47, 53 There are a number of variants of profile-profile alignment methods that differ in the scoring functions they use. 47, 50, [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] However, several analyses have shown that the overall performances of these methods are comparable. 47, [50] [51] [52] Some of the programs that can be used to detect suitable templates are FFAS, 60 SP3, 53 SALIGN, 47 and PPSCAN. 49 4.10.2.1.6 Sequence-structure threading methods As the sequence identity drops below the threshold of the twilight zone, there is usually insufficient signal in the sequences or their profiles for the sequence-based methods discussed above to detect true relationships. 44 Sequencestructure threading methods are most useful in this regime as they can sometimes recognize common folds, even in the absence of any statistically significant sequence similarity. 21 These methods achieve higher sensitivity by using structural information derived from the templates. The accuracy of a sequence-structure match is assessed by the score of a corresponding coarse model and not by sequence similarity, as in sequence comparison methods. 21 The scoring scheme used to evaluate the accuracy is either based on residue substitution tables dependent on structural features such as solvent exposure, secondary structure type, and hydrogen bonding properties, 53,61-63 or on statistical potentials for residue interactions implied by the alignment. [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] The use of structural data does not have to be restricted to the structure side of the aligned sequence-structure pair. For example, SAM-T02 makes use of the predicted local structure for the target sequence to enhance homolog detection and alignment accuracy. 69 Commonly used threading programs are GenTHREADER, 61,70 3D-PSSM, 71 Yet another strategy is to optimize the alignment by iterating over the process of calculating alignments, building models, and evaluating models. Such a protocol can sample alignments that are not statistically significant and identify the alignment that yields the best model. Although this procedure can be time-consuming, it can significantly improve the accuracy of the resulting comparative models in difficult cases. 72 alignment errors. Improving the performance and accuracy of methods in this regime remains one of the main tasks of comparative modeling today. 73 It is imperative to calculate an accurate alignment between the target-template pair, as comparative modeling can almost never recover from an alignment error. 74 ",

            "text": "After a list of all related protein structures and their alignments with the target sequence have been obtained, template structures are prioritized depending on the purpose of the comparative model. Template structures may be chosen purely based on the target-template sequence identity or a combination of several other criteria, such as experimental accuracy of the structures (resolution of x-ray structures, number of restraints per residue for NMR structures), conservation of active-site residues, holo-structures that have bound ligands of interest, and prior biological information that pertains to the solvent, pH, and quaternary contacts. It is not necessary to select only one template. In fact, the use of several templates approximately equidistant from the target sequence generally increases the model accuracy. 75 Once an initial target-template alignment is built, a variety of methods can be used to construct a 3D model for the target protein. 23, 74, [77] [78] [79] [80] The original and still widely used method is modeling by rigid-body assembly. 78, 79, 81 This method constructs the model from a few core regions, and from loops and side chains that are obtained by dissecting related structures. Commonly used programs that implement this method are COMPOSER, 82-85 3D-JIGSAW, 86 and SWISS-MODEL. 87 Another family of methods, modeling by segment matching, relies on the approximate positions of conserved atoms from the templates to calculate the coordinates of other atoms. [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] An instance of this approach is implemented in SegMod. 91 The third group of methods, modeling by satisfaction of spatial restraints, uses either distance geometry or optimization techniques to satisfy spatial restraints obtained from the alignment of the target sequences with the template structures. [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] Specifically, MODELLER, 96,98,99 our own program for comparative modeling, belongs to this group of methods.",

However, it is important that a modeling method allows a degree of flexibility and automation to obtain better models more easily and rapidly. For example, a method should allow for an easy recalculation of a model when a change is made in the alignment; it should be straightforward to calculate models based on several templates; and the method should provide tools for incorporation of prior knowledge about the target (e.g., cross-linking restraints and predicted secondary structure).",

While substitutions can occur throughout the length of the sequence, insertions and deletions mostly occur on the surface of proteins in segments that connect regular secondary structure segments (i.e., loops). While the template structures are helpful in the modeling of the aligned target backbone segments, they are generally less valuable for the modeling of side chains and irrelevant for the modeling of insertions such as loops. The loops and side chains of comparative models are especially important for ligand docking; thus, we discuss them in the following two sections. Loop modeling is an especially important aspect of comparative modeling in the range from 30% to 50% sequence identity. In this range of overall similarity, loops among the homologs vary while the core regions are still relatively conserved and aligned accurately. Loops often play an important role in defining the functional specificity of a given protein, forming the active and binding sites. Loop modeling can be seen as a mini protein folding problem because the correct conformation of a given segment of a polypeptide chain has to be calculated mainly from the sequence of the segment itself. However, loops are generally too short to provide sufficient information about their local fold. Even identical decapeptides in different proteins do not always have the same conformation. 104, 105 Some additional restraints are provided by the core anchor regions that span the loop and by the structure of the rest of the protein that cradles the loop. Although many loop-modeling methods have been described, it is still challenging to correctly and confidently model loops longer than approximately 8-10 residues. 98,106",

[108] [109] [110] There are also methods that combine these two approaches. 111 The database search approach to loop modeling is accurate and efficient when a database of specific loops is created to address the modeling of the same class of loops, such as b-hairpins, 113 or loops on a specific fold, such as the hypervariable regions in the immunoglobulin fold. 107, 114 There are attempts to classify loop conformations into more general categories, thus extending the applicability of the database search approach. [115] [116] [117] However, the database methods are limited because the number of possible conformations increases exponentially with the length of a loop. As a result, only loops up to 4-7 residues long have most of their conceivable conformations present in the database of known protein structures. 118, 119 This limitation is made even worse by the requirement for an overlap of at least one residue between the database fragment and the anchor core regions, which means that modeling a 5-residue insertion requires at least a 7-residue fragment from the database. 89 Despite the rapid growth of the database of known structures, it does not seem possible to cover most of the conformations of a 9-residue segment in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, most of the insertions in a family of homologous proteins are shorter than 10-12 residues. 98",

Improvements in implicit solvation models, such as the Generalized Born solvation model, motivated their use in loop modeling. The solvent contribution to the free energy can be added to the scoring function for optimization, or it can be used to rank the sampled loop conformations after they are generated with a scoring function that does not include the solvent terms. 98 Two simplifications are frequently applied in the modeling of side-chain conformations. 133 First, amino acid residue replacements often leave the backbone structure almost unchanged, 26 allowing us to fix the backbone during the search for the best side-chain conformations. Second, most side chains in high-resolution crystallographic structures can be represented by a limited number of conformers that comply with stereochemical and energetic constraints. 134 ",

However, when the sequence identity is lower, the first aspect of model evaluation is to confirm whether or not a correct template was used for modeling. It is often the case, when operating in this regime, that the fold assignment step produces only false positives. A further complication is that at such low similarities the alignment generally contains many errors, making it difficult to distinguish between an incorrect template on one hand and an incorrect alignment with a correct template on the other hand. There are several methods that use 3D profiles and statistical potentials, 65, 160, 161 which assess the compatibility between the sequence and modeled structure by evaluating the environment of each residue in a model with respect to the expected environment, as found in native high-resolution experimental structures. These methods can be used to assess whether or not the correct template was used for the modeling. They include VERIFY3D, 160 PROSAII, 162 HARMONY, 163 ANOLEA, 164 and DFIRE. 165 Even when the model is based on alignments that have 430% sequence identity, other factors, including the environment, can strongly influence the accuracy of a model. For instance, some calcium-binding proteins undergo large conformational changes when bound to calcium. If a calcium-free template is used to model the calcium-bound state of the target, it is likely that the model will be incorrect, irrespective of the target-template similarity or accuracy of the template structure. 166 ",

            "text": "The remainder of this review focuses on the use of comparative models for ligand docking (see also Chapter 4.19.2.5 ). [185] [186] [187] It is widely accepted that docking to comparative models is more challenging and less successful than docking to crystallographic structures. However, it seems that surprisingly little work has been done to obtain quantitative information about the accuracy of docking to comparative models, to determine in detail why the results are inferior to those obtained with crystal structures, and to improve methods for docking to comparative models. We begin our discussion with a study by McGovern and Shoichet 188 that compared the success of docking against three different conformations of 10 enzymes: holo (ligand-bound), apo, and homology modeled. All 10 enzymes had known structures in both the holo and apo form. Comparative models for each of these enzymes were taken from MODBASE, a database of comparative models for all protein sequences that are detectably related to at least one known structure. The models were based on single template structures with sequence identities in the range of 28-87%. Each enzyme had multiple known inhibitors in the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) database, a library of drug-like molecules where each molecule has been annotated by the receptor to which it binds. Success of the docking, carried out with the Shoichet group's version of DOCK, 189, 190 was assessed by enrichment: the ability to distinguish known inhibitors from a large set of B100 000 'decoys' relative to random selection. As might be expected, the holo structures were the best at selecting the known ligands from among the MDDR decoys based on the docking score. Unexpectedly, the comparative models often ranked known ligands among the top-scoring database molecules; in four targets, the enrichment was 20 times higher than expected by chance. 188 In one case, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, the modeled structure actually performed better than the holo structure. For the comparative model, 25% of the known ligands were found in the top 1.2% of the ranked database, whereas for the holo conformation, 2.8% of the ranked list had to be searched before 25% of the ligands were found. In another example, the holo structure of thymidylate synthase correctly recognized ligands similar in size to the ligand captured in the x-ray structure, but not ligands that were markedly different from it. In contrast, the binding sites in the modeled conformations were more spacious and could in fact correctly detect and accommodate larger ligands than the holo receptor ( Figure 5) . Thus, it appears that, while x-ray crystallographic structures remain the first choice in docking, many comparative models seem sufficiently accurate to rank highly known ligands from among a very large list of possible alternatives.",

Li et al. 191 subsequently used similar methods to develop nanomolar inhibitors of falcipain that are active against chloroquineresistant strains of malaria. In a study by Selzer et al. 193 comparative models were used to predict new nonpeptide inhibitors of cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases in Leishmania major. Sixty-nine compounds were selected by DOCK 3.5 as strong binders to a comparative model of protein cpB, and of these, 21 had experimental IC 50 values below 100 mmol L \u00c0 1 . Finally, in a recent study by Que et al. 192 comparative models were used to rationalize ligand-binding affinities of cysteine proteases in Entamoeba histolytica.

The comparative model employed thrombin as the template, sharing only 34% sequence identity with the target sequence. Moreover, some residues in the binding site are significantly different; a trio of charged Asp residues in matriptase correspond to 1 Tyr and 2 Trp residues in thrombin. Thrombin was chosen as the template, in part because it prefers substrates with positively charged residues at the P1 position, as does matriptase. The comparative model was constructed using MODELLER and refined with MD simulations in CHARMM. The National Cancer Institute database was used for virtual screening that targeted the S1 site with the DOCK program. The 2000 best-scoring compounds were manually inspected to identify positively charged ligands (the S1 site is negatively charged), and 69 compounds were experimentally screened for inhibition, identifying the 15 inhibitors. One of them, hexamidine, was used as a lead to identify additional compounds selective for matriptase relative to thrombin. The Wang group has also used similar methods to discover seven new, low-micromolar inhibitors of Bcl-2, using a comparative model based on the NMR solution structure of Bcl-X L . 195 Schapira et al. 196 discovered a novel inhibitor of a retinoic acid receptor by virtual screening using a comparative model. In this case, the target (RAR-a) and template (RAR-g) are very closely related; only three residues in the binding site are not conserved. The ICM program was used for virtual screening of ligands from the Available Chemicals Directory (ACD). The 5364 high-scoring compounds identified in the first round were subsequently docked into a full atom representation of the receptor with flexible side chains to obtain a final set of 300 good-scoring hits. These compounds were then manually inspected to choose the final 30 for testing. Two novel agonists were identified, with 50-nanomolar activity. Zuccotto et al. 197 identified novel inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in Trypanosoma cruzi (the parasite that causes Chagas disease) by docking into a comparative model based on B50% sequence identity to DHFR in L. major, a related parasite. The virtual screening procedure used DOCK for rigid docking of over 50 000 selected compounds from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Visual inspection of the top 100 hits was used to select 36 compounds for experimental testing. This work identified several novel scaffolds with micromolar IC 50 values. The authors report attempting to use virtual screening results to identify compounds with greater affinity for T. cruzi DHFR than human DHFR, but it is not clear how successful they were.",

In particular, a comparison of the active site residues in these and other related structures suggested that the AG7088 inhibitor of the human rhinovirus type 2 3C protease is a good starting point for design of anticoronaviral drugs. 199 Comparative models of protein kinases combined with virtual screening have also been intensely used for drug discovery. [200] [201] [202] [203] [204] The 4500 kinases in the human genome, the relatively small number of experimental structures available, and the high level of conservation around the important adenosine triphosphate-binding site make comparative modeling an attractive approach toward structure-based drug discovery.",

A flexible receptor approach is necessary to address such induced-fit cases 211,212 * The accuracy of comparative models is frequently judged by the C a root mean square error or other similar measures of backbone accuracy. For virtual screening, however, the precise positioning of side chains in the binding site is likely to be critical; measures of accuracy for binding sites are needed to help evaluate the suitability of comparative modeling algorithms for constructing models for docking * Knowledge of known inhibitors, either for the target protein or the template, should help to evaluate and improve virtual screening against comparative models. For example, comparative models constructed from holo' template structures implicitly preserve some information about the ligand-bound receptor conformation * Improvement in the accuracy of models produced by comparative modeling will require methods that finely sample protein conformational space using a free energy or scoring function that has sufficient accuracy to distinguish the native structure from the nonnative conformations. Despite many years of development of molecular simulation methods, attempts to refine models that are already relatively close to the native structure have met with relatively little success. This failure is likely to be due in part to inaccuracies in the scoring functions used in the simulations, particularly in the treatment of electrostatics and solvation effects.
