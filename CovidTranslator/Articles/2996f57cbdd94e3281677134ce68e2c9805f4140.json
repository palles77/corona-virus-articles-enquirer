The tricuspid valve is composed of two rather than three cusps; the aortic nerve is not associated with chemoreceptors but only with baroreceptors; and the rabbit pulmonary artery and its branches are heavily muscular. 6 Additionally, the myocardium has limited collateral circulation and is therefore predisposed to ischemia mediated by coronary vasoconstriction. 26 RABBITS syncope, anorexia, weight loss, and malaise may be signs of heart disease in rabbits.",

In rabbits suspected of having cardiac disease or respiratory distress, focus the initial examination on observing the respiratory rate and pattern, obtaining the heart rate and rhythm, auscultating the thorax, examining the mucous membranes, and palpating the pulses. Normal heart rate is 180 to 250 beats/min and normal respiratory rate is 30 to 60 breaths/min. Rabbits with heart disease may have cyanotic or pale mucous membranes, arrhythmia, or heart murmurs. Rabbits with congestive heart failure often have tachycardia, tachypnea, and labored breathing. Pulses may be irregular or weak. Auscultating the thorax systematically is the most important part of the cardiac examination. It is important to listen over the entire thorax to localize heart murmurs and detect arrhythmias and lung sound abnormalities. A pediatric stethoscope allows better localization of heart sounds in rabbits and is preferred for cardiac auscultation; a larger-diaphragm stethoscope enhances auscultation of the lungs. Auscultatory findings vary among rabbits with congestive heart failure, and these findings are not pathognomonic. The examiner may hear muffled heart and lung sounds with pleural effusion and increased bronchial sounds or crackles with pulmonary edema.",

In the WH strain, affected rabbits die at 5 to 13 months of age, usually with generalized lymphoma involving visceral organs and lymph nodes similar to the distribution of organ involvement seen in other domestic animals. 12 This pattern of susceptibility was also thought compatible with vertical transmission of a virus, as occurs with feline leukemia virus. Some have speculated that lymphoma in rabbits is caused by an oncogenic C-type tumor virus, similar to viruses associated with lymphoma in rodents. In an early study, tissues samples from an adult New Zealand white rabbit with generalized lymphoma were examined in an attempt to document the presence of virus. 42 Results of electron microscopic examination, tissue culture, immunodiffusion studies with FeLV antiserum, and immunofluorescent tests were negative for the virus. However, in another study, viruslike particles were demonstrated by electron microscopy in the kidneys of a 7-month-old New Zealand white rabbit with generalized lymphoma. 15 ",

In another report, three domestic rabbits were diagnosed with cutaneous lymphoma. 46 Two rabbits were young (7 months and 1 year) and the third was 9 years. One young rabbit had erythematous alopecia and hemorrhagic crusts of the chin and ventral neck. At necropsy, neoplastic lymphocytes were found in the skin, lymph nodes, and lungs. In skin sections, the lymphocytes infiltrated the entire dermis and into the epidermis. The second rabbit had bilateral blepharitis that was unresponsive to treatment. At necropsy, superficial and deep lymph nodes were markedly enlarged, and lungs had reddened areas. Lymphocytic infiltrates were found in the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart. In the skin sections, lymphoid infiltrates were primarily in the subcutis and deep dermis. The third rabbit had nonpruritic alopecia of the left lateral thorax. Cutaneous lymphoma was diagnosed by biopsy of a skin sample; in this rabbit, lymphocytes infiltrated the superficial dermis and epidermis. The rabbit lived for an additional year after diagnosis, with no response to treatment with interferon alpha-2b (see Treatment below). A necropsy was not performed. In all three rabbits, immunologic staining of tissue sections confirmed the lymphoma to be of T-cell origin.",

In one study, rabbits that were experimentally infected with spores of E. cuniculi were treated with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg first dose, then 15 mg/kg weekly for a 12-week period). In these rabbits, clinical signs of encephalitozoonosis developed between weeks 4 and 6, and all rabbits died during week 6. No signs of infection were seen in control rabbits. These results indicate that immunosuppression induced by cyclophosphamide gave rise to lethal encephalitozoonosis. Most likely, the rabbit we treated with prednisone and radiation therapy also developed encephalitozoonosis because of immunosuppression. Other side effects can include severe anemia, enteritis, typhlitis, and nephrotoxicity. In an experimental study of rabbits given daunorubicin or doxorubicin at 3 mg/kg weekly for 10 weeks, cardiotoxicity was documented with daunorubicin but not with doxorubicin. 20 Both drugs produced hemotoxicosis manifested by aplastic anemia. Rabbits treated with doxorubicin exhibited more weight loss and had higher mortality rates than those treated with daunorubicin.

The mass has regressed considerably in size, and the heart is in a more normal position. at 10,000 IU/kg when given intravenously can induce a hyperinsulinemic, insulin-resistant, diabetic syndrome in rabbits. 22 However, in small animals L-asparaginase is currently given intramuscularly or subcutaneously; therefore route of administration may factor in toxicity. The neurotoxic effects of vincristine have been well studied in rabbits. 11, 29, 30 Radiation No reports describe the use of radiation in treating rabbits with lymphoid disorders. However, rabbits have been used in research studies regarding effects of irradiation on soft tissues. 7, 9 We have used radiation therapy to treat one rabbit with a thymoma. The rabbit was given a short course of radiation treatment with 800 rad (8 Gy) per treatment on days 0, 7, and 21. The tumor was considerably smaller after the first treatment (see Fig. 21-5, B) . However, 1 month after the final treatment the rabbit was euthanatized because of pleural effusion and poor clinical condition. As described previously, fibrotic tissue was found at the tumor site at necropsy, with thrombosis of mediastinal vessels.",

A, In the right lateral view, the cardiac silhouette is generally enlarged and can be seen throughout four intercostal spaces. The intrathoracic trachea and carina are dorsally elevated, and the main stem bronchi are compressed and deviated by an enlarged left atrium. The caudal border of the heart is rounded by left atrial and left ventricular enlargement. The cranial border of the heart is rounded, and the trachea is elevated cranial to the carina because of right atrial and ventricular enlargement. B, In the ventrodorsal view, an enlarged left auricle is evident as a bulge between the 2-and 3-o'clock positions. The left ventricular apex is rounded by an enlarged left ventricle. An enlarged right atrium is evident as a bulge between the 9and 11-o'clock positions.",
