            "text": "Coronavirus papain-like proteases (PLPs) can act as proteases that process virus-encoded large replicase polyproteins and also as deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes. Like the PLPs of other coronaviruses (CoVs), the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) PLP catalyzes proteolysis of Gly-Gly dipeptide bonds to release mature cleavage products. However, the other functions of the IBV PLP are not well understood. In this study, we found that IBV exhibits strong global DUB activity with significant reductions of the levels of ubiquitin (Ub)-, K48-, and K63conjugated proteins. The DUB activity exhibited a clear time dependence, with stronger DUB activity in the early stage of viral infection. Furthermore, the IBV replicaseencoded PLP, including the downstream transmembrane (TM) domain, is a DUB enzyme and dramatically reduced the level of Ub-conjugated proteins, while processing both K48-and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. By contrast, PLP did not cause any reduction of haemagglutinin (HA)-Ub-conjugated proteins. In addition, mutations of the catalytic residues of PLP-TM, Cys1274Ser and His1437Lys, reduced DUB activity against Ub-, K48-and K63-conjugated proteins, indicating that the DUB activity of the PLP-TM wild-type protein is not completely dependent on its catalytic activity. Overall, these results demonstrate that the IBV-encoded PLP-TM functions as a DUB enzyme and suggest that IBV may interfere with the activation of host antiviral signaling pathway by degrading polyubiquitinassociated proteins.",

Proteolysis at the Gly673-Gly674 and Gly2265-Gly2266 dipeptide bonds leads to release of the 87-kDa and 195-kDa N-terminal mature proteins and the C-terminal 41-kDa cleavage product [20, 21, 23] .

At least two CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1] and IBV [21] encode only one functional papain-like protease, termed PLP. The proteolytic processing mediated by the PLP encoded by IBV [20] is similar to that of PLP2 encoded by other CoVs [3, 6] . PLPs of CoVs also perform deubiquitinating (DUB) and interferon (IFN) antagonism activities. For instance, PLP2 of MHV-A59 [29] can bind to IRF3, cause its deubiquitination and prevent its nuclear translocation, thus inhibiting cellular IRF3-mediated type I IFN production and promoting viral infection. The SARS-CoV PLP pro-catalytic core also has DUB activity and can deubiquitinate IRF3, thereby stalling its migration to the nucleus and preventing the host antiviral response [7, 10, 26] . Similarly, purified PLP2 of HCoV-NL63 can hydrolyze K48linked hexa-ubiquitin (K48-Ub6) to produce monoubiquitin [6, 7] , and therefore negatively regulate antiviral defenses by disrupting the STING-mediated IFN induction [26] .",

We also evaluated the role of PLP catalytic activity in DUB activity and found that PLP-TM does not require catalytic activity to cleave polyubiquitin-linked proteins.

PLP2 of PEDV has potent DUB activity that is dependent on its catalytic activity. In notable contrast to PEDV PLP2, the DUB activity of IBV PLP is not dependent on its protease activity. Another group reported that IBV PLP can degrade K48-and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to monoubiquitin but cannot degrade linear polyubiquitin [18] . HCoV-NL63 PLP2 has a DUB activity that is dependent on its protease activity [7] . By contrast, both the PLP2-TM and catalytic mutants of PLP2-TM [26] had DUB activity, although the DUB activity of the PLP2-TM catalytic mutants was lower than that of PLP2-TM, suggesting that the TM domain plays a role in PLP2 DUB activity. Similarly, our study confirmed that the TM domain downstream of IBV PLP is essential for PLP DUB activity. The IBV PLP cleaves the ORF 1a to generate nonstructural proteins that associate with endoplasmic reticulum membranes to generate convoluted membranes and double membrane vesicles (DMVs), which are the site of viral replication. The PLPs are tethered to the DMVs by a TM domain [12, 17] . Many reports have demonstrated that the TM domain plays an important role in CoVs DUB activity, possibly by facilitating correct protein folding or interactions with cellular proteins. Additional studies are needed to identify the exact functions of the TM domain during IBV replication and the interaction between the host innate immune system and IBV infection.",

            "text": "This study raises important questions concerning the role of viral DUB activity in CoV replication and pathogenesis. Coronaviral DUB activity may target the Ubproteasome pathway to facilitate virus replication and damage host defense mechanisms, including innate immunity [5, 8] . Some CoVs may utilize DUB activity to escape the host innate antiviral response [13, 27] . For example, PLP2 of MHV-A59 can bind to IRF3, cause its deubiquitination and prevent its nuclear translocation. Coexpression of PLP2 inhibits CARDIF-, TBK1-and IRF3mediated IFN-b reporter activities [29] . MHV-A59 may use DUB activity to reduce IFN induction, to promote viral growth and to escape from host innate antiviral responses [29] . PEDV infection suppresses the production of IFN-b and PLP2 acts as a viral DUB to interfere with RIG-I-and STING-mediated signaling pathways [28] . However, some CoVs PLP-mediated interferon antagonism is independent on protease and DUB activity. The PLP2 of NL63 has DUB activity and antagonizes the induction of type I IFN, whereas PLP-mediated IFN antagonism is independent of DUB activity [6] . These data show that CoVs PLPs target the activity of type I IFN through DUB activity and inhibit the activation of the innate immune system. Joeri Kint et al. showed that IBV inhibits the synthesis of host proteins, including type IIFN, a key component of the antiviral response [15, 16] . Our study also indicates that IBV PLP-TM process both K48-and K63-linked ubiquitin. K48-and K63-linked ubiquitin are the most common types of modified polyubiquitin and play key roles in protein degradation and in response to changes in the innate and adaptive immunity systems. Further investigations are necessary to determine if IBV PLP DUB activity inhibits the host antiviral response.",

(a) DUB activity of IBV for Ub-and K48-and K63-linked polyubiquitin. DF1 cells were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and then infected with IBV at an MOI of 10 or mockinfected. (b) DF1 cells were infected with IBV at an MOI of 10 or mock-infected and then the infected cells were transfected with pRK5-HA-Ub at 12 h, 18 h or 24 h for an additional 24 h. The HA-tagged Ub-conjugated protein was assayed with an anti-HA antibody by western blot (top panel). b-actin was detected as a loading control (middle panel). The IBV-encoded N protein was detected with an anti-N antibody (bottom panel). (c) The Ub-conjugated proteins in Fig. 1b were quantified using biological analysis software (Image-Pro-plus 6.0). The fold change of Ub-conjugated proteins was expressed as densitometric units of bands normalized to b-actin c Fig. 2 IBV PLP-TM, but not PLP, has global deubiquitinating activity in cultured cells. (a) Schematic diagram of the IBV genomic RNA and the resulting polyprotein 1ab, which includes the viral protease PLP. The flag-tagged constructs of PLP used in this study are listed and the catalytic residues numbers from ORF 1a are shown [9, 21]. (b) Prediction of the transmembrane helical domain near PLP. The transmembrane domain (red) is identified with high probability; the predicted topology suggests that most of the protein is extracellular (pink) with a short cytoplasmic domain (blue). (c) PLP and PLP-TM were transfected into DF1 cells along with pRK5-HA-Ub. (d) DF1 cells were co-transfected with pRK5-HA-Ub or pRK5-HA-Ub-K48 or pRK5-HA-Ub-K63, along with the indicated amounts of PLP-TM. Cell lysates were prepared at 24 h post-transfection and analyzed for HA-Ub-conjugated proteins by western blot with an anti-HA antibody (top panel). Anti-flag was used to confirm the expression of PLP and PLP-TM (second panel), and b-actin was detected as a loading control (bottom panel) (color figure online)",
