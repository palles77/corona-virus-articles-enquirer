            "text": "Three unrecognized field isolates of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) were recovered from commercial broiler chickens vaccinated with live Mass viral strain (H120). These isolates were identified by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies produced against reference serotypes: Mass, Conn, and Ark. RT-PCRs were performed on viral RNAs to amplify S1 gene using a specific set of primers S1OLIGO3 0 and S1OLIGO5 0 . Restriction polymorphism (RFLP) of PCR products was determined by the use of HaeIII restriction enzyme. As expected, patterns of PCR products were different from common pattern of strains assigned to Mass serotype M41, Beaudette, H120, and Florida. Molecular analysis showed a nucleotide insertion in hypervariable region one (HVR-1) of S1 gene of only Quebec isolates (Qu16, Qu_mv and Q_37zm). However, New Brunswick IBV isolate (NB_cp) did not display these insertions. Major amino acid changes involved insertion of two stretches (aa 118\u00b1119 : Arg\u00b1Ser and aa 141\u00b1145 : Sys\u00b1Ser\u00b1Asn\u00b1Ala\u00b1Ser\u00b1Cys) located at N-terminal and C-terminal regions of HVR-2. It is speculated that cysteine residue located upstream and downstream of Cys\u00b1Ser\u00b1Asn\u00b1Ala\u00b1Ser\u00b1Cys segment might be involved in the formation of loop structure and disulfide bond that could trigger important epitope changes. Insertion of new NXT and NXS (X 6 P) glycosylation motifs scattered along S1 region and insertion of cysteine residues in HVR are contributing to the antigenic shifting of Quebec isolates. Fragment insertions were thought to be induced by inter-serotype recombination between vaccine strain (H120) that belongs to Mass serotype and another strain belonging to Ark serotype. Phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences showed that Quebec isolates formed a new phylogenetic cluster.",

This hybrid S1 gene was very likely the product of recombination events that occurred at about 153 bases downstream end of start codon. Thus, suggest that recombination events may be an important mechanism by which new IBV strains have been generated and implicated in recent IBV outbreak in Quebec. In view of the fact that some of IBV strains were isolated from chicks immunized with live Mass vaccine, the vaccine could be implicated as a source of the Mass-like sequence of Quebec strains. Since vaccines containing Ark strains are not authorized in Canada, the Ark-like sequence may have derived from a naturally occurring virus or from the chicks imported form USA that might have been inadvertently immunized with live Ark vaccines.",

According to HaeIII RFLP pattern we could identify the location of sequence insertions in S1 gene of Qu16 and Qu_mv isolates. HaeIII RFLP pattern of Qu16, and Qu_mv isolates had three bands of 900, 380, and 200 bp in size (Fig. 4) , but did not have the 950, 500 and 380 bp bands characteristic of Mass strains M41, Beaudette, H120, and Florida [24, 25] . However, HaeIII pattern of NB_cp strain was identical to HaeIII pattern of Mass strains. This suggests that the Quebec IBV isolates might be new variants of IBV. Sequence insertion and point mutations in hypervariable regions were probably the reason for the shifting of HaeIII restriction sites and variation of RFLP pattern. The RFLP profile was consistent with the DNA sequencing results. However, thorough restriction pattern study using more than one endonuclease to confirm sequencing variation is Fig. 3 . Phylogenetic analysis of IBV Quebec isolates and other IBV reference strains, based on amino acid sequences. Phylogenetic tree was constructed based on alignment of Quebec IBV isolates (Qu16, Qu_mv, Qu_37zm) S1 gene amino acid sequences with amino acid sequences of IBV reference strains (Ark99, Cu_T2, Ark-like, Gray, JMK, M41, Beaudette, H120, Florida, D207, UK/7/93) and New Brunswick IBV isolate (NB_cp) S1 gene amino acid sequences. Alignment showed those IBV isolates Qu16, Qu_mv, and Qu_37zm form a new phylogenetic cluster. However, New Brunswick (Canada) IBV isolate remained in Mass serotype cluster (M41, Beaudette, H120, Florida). expected. Genotyping method using PCR and RFLP analysis have been reported to agree with VN test, which is the reference method of serotyping of IBV isolates [24] .",

This was probably due to the weak titer of antibodies in antisera prepared against reference serotypes as well as against IBV Quebec isolates. It was possible to inoculate chicks repeatedly to boost the titer of antibodies, but since we observed an antigenic variability of the virus [26] we performed only two inoculations. Alternatively, the weak titer of antibodies could be associated also to the immune response of birds.",
