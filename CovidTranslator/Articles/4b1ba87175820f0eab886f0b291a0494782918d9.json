The RRT-PCR has a detection limit of approximately five copies of target RNA/reaction and excellent reaction parameters tested in four IA viruses reference laboratories. The inclusivity of the assay was estimated at both the bioinformatic and the experimental level. Our results predicted that this RRT-PCR assay was able to detect 99.5% of known human IA virus strains, 99.84% of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) strains, 99.75% of avian strains, 98.89% of swine strains, 98.15% of equine strains, and 100% of influenza A viruses of other origin.",

Therefore, the development of universal methods to detect as many genetic variants of the virus as possible is of crucial importance for IA virus surveillance, especially in avian species, which are considered the natural reservoir of IA virus [11, 14, 19] .",

Conventionally, these RT-PCR screening methods were designed to detect IA virus on a universal basis by amplifying a selected portion of the membrane protein (MP) gene segment [3-5, 9, 11, 16, 18, 21] . The MP gene segment is a bicistronic RNA molecule encoding two proteins, M1 and M2. The gene that encodes the M1 protein is considered to be highly conserved across various IA virus subtypes and host species. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analysis of a large panel of MP sequences has revealed that the sequence conservation is at the amino acid rather than the nucleotide sequence level, where the latter exhibits significant variation in both the M1 and M2 genes [8, 20] . Accordingly, mutations in the MP gene segment result predominantly in synonymous codon changes, mostly in the M1 gene [8, 17, 20] , which constitutes 73.6% of the whole segment.",

Multiple sequence alignments were constructed on the basis of 4,125 human, 3,896 avian, 484 swine, 96 equine and 146 other sequences. Each sequence pool was aligned using the MAFFT program (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transformation) [10] employing the FFT-NS-1 or FFT-NS-2 method.

To test this possibility, the only IA virus strain in our repository known to hold a single point mutation within the probe-binding region, A/duck/Czechoslovakia/ 56 (H4N6), was examined. As expected, this mutation was deleterious for probe binding and the A/duck/ Czechoslovakia/56 (H4N6) strain escaped detection in the real-time format of the reaction. However, agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a strong band for PCR amplicon, suggesting that the detection of the viral strain was dependent solely on the probe sequence.

There are several assays based on in vitro amplification of the MP fragment of the IA virus genome [3-5, 9, 11, 16, 18, 21] . Most of them were developed after careful analysis, but some are not completely universal for the detection of all IA virus strains. We focused on the development and evaluation of an RRT-PCR assay for universal detection of IA virus that is suitable for detection the virus in various avian, human and other mammal species and attempted to prove the assay's universality, both in a bioinformatic and experimental manner.",

We defined the inclusivity as a quantitative expression of the portion of MP segments within the nucleotide sequence collection known to date that can be theoretically detected by the assay. The bioinformatic analysis predicted that sequences for the forward and reverse primers match over 97% of the over 10,000 IA virus sequences tested. Thus, the sequence complementarity was not absolute, even at the strongly conserved positions. Such IA virus strains were highly suspected of being escape mutants in the SVIP-MP assay. To test our assay for universality at the experimental level we used an original approach. Due to experimental limitations, mutated primers mimicking the original mutations were synthesized rather than preparing mutated MP sequences. In spite this experimental shift, we expect that this mechanism may act vice versa. The experiments confirmed that all mutated primers amplified the RNA standard successfully, but deviations in C t were observed. These deviations ranged from 3.1, 4.2 and 3.6 C t values for mutated forward and 3, 2.9 and 2.8 for mutated reverse primers, respectively, observed at three dilutions (10 2 , 10 4 and 10 6 copies/ reaction). Taken together, we conclude that the primers developed in our study had 100% inclusivity on the basis of retrospective sequence data.",

The samples included alantoic fluids, lyophilized cell cultures, and IAvirus-positive field specimens (organ suspensions, cloacal, tracheal, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavages). The IA virus panel contained 69 human, 30 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), 177 avian, 26 swine and 18 equine strains representing 15 hemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes, i.e. 42 subtype combinations (SupplementaryTable S1). The strains originated in both Eurasia and North America and encompassed a collection period from 1947 to 2009. All specimens were selected from the repositories of the State Veterinary Institute Prague (SVIP) and National Institute of Public Health (NIPH), Czech Republic, the State Veterinary Institute Zvolen (SVIZ), Slovak Republic, and the Central Agricultural Office (CAO), Hungary.Field samples used in surveillance included 3,323 pooled organ suspensions and cloacal or tracheal swabs collected from birds and 53 equine nasal swabs. The samples were collected during the surveillance of avian IA viruses in the Czech Republic in 2007-2009. The birds were of 29 avian species including both wild and domestic birds. Nucleic acid extraction RNA or total nucleic acid was extracted using a MagNA-Pure Compact, MagNAPure LC (both from Roche), Biorobot M48 (Qiagen), X-tractor Gene (Corbett Robotics) extractors or an RTP \u00d2 DNA/RNA Virus Mini Kit (Invitek). The MagNAPure instruments used the Total Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit with input sample volumes of 200 or 400 ll and elution volumes of 50 or 100 ll. Extraction with the Biorobot M48 was performed using a MagAttract Viral RNA M48 Kit with input and elution volumes of 300 and 50 ll, respectively. The X-tractor Gene device employed the SV96 Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) with input and elution volumes of 100 and 50 ll, respectively.Selection of RRT-PCR primers and probeThe PCR primers were selected as a result of comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. To identify conserved regions within the IA virus MP segment, all of the MP sequence data in the Influenza Virus Sequence Database (ISD;[1]) were analysed, representing 8,747 sequences (reference date",
