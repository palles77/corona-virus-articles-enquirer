            "text": "Giraffe With a height of up to more than 5 meters (m), giraffes are characterized by their extremely long necks and long legs, with considerably longer forelimbs than hindlimbs. The head is fairly small, with two horns or ossicones and a central osseous protuberance, which is particularly developed in the males. The tongue is long and flexible, its distal 20 cm pigmented. Mature males weigh 850 to 1950 kilograms (kg) and females 700 to 1200 kg. The internal anatomy of giraffes is analogous to that of the domestic cow and other artiodactylids. The dental formula for giraffes is incisors (I) 0/3, canines (C) 0/1, premolars (P) 3/3, molars (M) 3/3, for a total of 33. Often, the gallbladder is absent, although it occurs in some individuals. Two jugular veins run immediately under the skin on either side of the ventral neck.",

Both stroke volume and cardiac output are lower than in similar-sized mammals. Blood volume is unusually low, and compliance of the vascular system is also low. The peculiar vascular anatomy-with narrow, rigid veins with low compliance in the legs and large, compliant veins in the neck region-gives rise to an interesting and nonintuitive physiologic phenomenon. 6 When the head of the anesthetized giraffe is lowered, blood pressure at head-level briefly spikes, before returning to much lower values. The lowering of the blood pressure coincides with pooling of blood in the compliant jugular veins, giving rise to a decreased cardiac preload and consequently lower systemic blood pressure (Frank-Starling mechanism). As a consequence of this mechanism, the arterial pressure at head level is maintained at or near 100 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), and the central blood pressure is directly proportional to the position of the head relative to the heart. Because of the high arterial pressures and the hydrostatic pressure, the arterial pressure in the lower leg may exceed 450 mm Hg. Edema in this region is prevented through a gravitysuit-like fascia and skin, prominent lymphatics, and well-developed valves in veins and lymphatics, as well as an abrupt narrowing of the arterial lumen at the level of the elbow or stifle.",

In the wild, giraffes mainly feed on Acacia species, and the natural diet of the okapi includes a variety of species. In an attempt to avoid negative energy balance, captive diets have traditionally contained high levels of protein (15%-20%) and starch (20%-30%). Based on wild diets, current recommendations include crude protein levels of only 10%-14%, starch levels below 5%, fat 2%-5%, and high amounts of fiber (minimally 25% acid detergent fiber) all based on a drymatter basis. 58 Care should be taken to keep calcium levels high and phosphorus levels low. The new diet regimens have recently been shown to lead to increased serum levels of magnesium as well as n3 and n6 fatty acids and decreased levels of phosphorus and saturated fatty acids 36, 41 so that blood nutrient profiles more closely match those of free-ranging giraffe. 36 The importance of browse, for both the nutritional value and the behavioral well-being of animals, cannot be overstated and browse should be provided to the greatest extent possible, but good-quality hay and alfalfa as well as silage may be substituted. Surplus buds and twigs from rose growers have been used successfully in okapis. 59 The precise mineral and vitamin requirements of giraffids have not been established, but animals should have access to trace mineral salt blocks, and copper supplementation should be considered if deficiencies are suspected.",

The key to success is careful planning and the availability of trained personnel and necessary equipment. The ideal induction occurs in a well-designed restraint device, which may be opened fully once the animal is recumbent. The second-best solution is a chute-system, where a halter may be placed on the sedated giraffe prior to induction, which will allow control of the head via a rope and pulley. The third-best option is to place a loop of thick rope around the base of the neck of the sedated animal and \"walk\" the animal to an open area with no obstacles, where it is made to walk in circles, with one to three handlers holding the rope. The animal is then tripped with another rope while still awake enough to maintain some control of the head during the fall. If neither of these options are available, the animal may be allowed to become recumbent in a padded stall or at least in an area without major obstacles. In either case, it is crucial to gain control of the animal' s head as soon as it becomes recumbent, as most injuries occur when the heavily sedated giraffe attempts to stand and falls again.",

With opioid-based protocols, induction may sometimes result in excitement or tumbling. A staged approach, in which sedatives are allowed to set in for 15 to 20 minutes prior to opioid administration, is preferable, and once the opioid takes effect, two experienced helpers may use mild physical restraint with mattresses or boards to prevent injury. 12 Regurgitation under anesthesia may be a concern in both giraffes and okapis, but particularly in the latter. The frequent early reports of regurgitation in okapis sedated with Immobilon (etorphine and acepromazine) was attributed to etorphine but likely largely was a reaction to acepromazine, which this author considers contraindicated in okapis. In animals fed mainly hay and pelleted feed, withholding food and water for 12 hours prior to a planned procedure is sufficient, but in animals eating large amounts of fresh browse, a 24-hour period is advisable. To minimize pulmonary compromise and ventilation-perfusion mismatch, a sternal position is preferable, when feasible, but giraffes generally do well in lateral recumbency for shorter periods. To reduce the risk of regurgitation and to stabilize blood pressure (see Unique Physiology section), the head should be elevated 80 to 150 cm above heart level. The neck should be kept as straight as possible, and placement of a padded board or ladder under the shoulder and onto bales of straw or similar material works well for this purpose.",

            "text": "The immobilization of free-ranging giraffes for capture purposes has little in common with controlled anesthesia for longer procedures in captive animals. The approach currently employed by most successful capture crews relies on massive dosing with potent opioids (etorphine, carfentanil, thiafentanil, or a combination) to reduce the time from darting to recumbency and subsequent skilled handling of the awake, but physically restrained, animal. 63 The giraffe is darted from the ground or, more commonly, from a helicopter, and typically the animal goes down within minutes, although some animals need to be cast with ropes. Soon after the giraffe becomes recumbent, it is blindfolded, ears plugged, and haltered and reversal agents are administered. Once the animal stands again after a few minutes, it is led with ropes into an open trailer used to be transported to a larger contained trailer that accommodates several animals. Refer to Table 61 -1 for doses. Other methods incorporating ketamine, with or without medetomidine, to reduce the opioid dosage result in longer induction times but more controlled immobilization. 8, 11 Recently, mass capture using a funnel system has been employed successfully for translocations.",

Pregnancy may also be detected by means of urinary and fecal steroid analysis. 38, 60 Predicting the time of birth precisely is difficult in giraffes. The udder typically, but not always, becomes enlarged in the last few weeks prior to parturition. Vulvar edema and a mucoid discharge may precede parturition by a few days. If possible, the female should be isolated from the herd shortly before parturition and remain separate with the calf for at least 24 hours, but if adequate space is available, the female may simply give birth while with the herd. Giraffids usually give birth to a single calf; however, twinning does occur. In the okapi, several twin pregnancies have ended in stillbirths. 59 Labor is usually short (3-6 hours) , and the healthy calf should be standing within an hour or so of birth. The birthing environment is important for neonatal survival. A proper substrate of compacted soil, rubber pads, or straw bedding is important to prevent hypothermia and splaying. Nursing should start within the first few hours after birth. First-time mothers may be nervous and may at first refuse to allow the calf to suckle. They usually relax after a few hours, but mild sedation has been necessary in several instances. 19 Neonatal examinations are useful for assessing the general health of the neonate and determining the success of immunoglobulin transfer from the dam.
