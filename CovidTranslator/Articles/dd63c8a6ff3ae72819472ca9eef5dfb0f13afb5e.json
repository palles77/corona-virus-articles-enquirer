Here, we report a feasibility study for producing the human b-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) via transformation of tobacco chloroplasts. Stable integration of human BACE into the plastome was confirmed by PCR. Genomic Southern blot analysis detected the presence of the tobacco aadA and human BACE genes between trnI and trnA in the plastome. Northern blot analysis revealed that the aadA and BACE genes were both properly transcribed into a dicistronic transcriptional unit. Human BACE protein expression in transplastomic tobacco was determined by western blot analysis. ELISA analysis revealed that, based on a dilution series of E. coli-derived BACE as a standard, transplastomic lines accumulated BACE to levels of 2.0% of total soluble proteins. When mice were gavaged with the transplastomic tobacco extracts, they showed an immune response against the BACE antigen. The successful production of plastid-based BACE protein has the potential for developing a plant-based vaccine against Alzheimer disease.",

            "text": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a widespread senile dementia characterized by the progressive formation of insoluble amyloid plaques in the brain. The amyloid plaques comprise a 4 kDa b-amyloid protein (Ab) derived by sequential proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the activities of band c-secretases (Tanahashi and Tabira 2007; McConlogue et al. 2007 ). These enzymes are considered to be therapeutic targets important in the treatment of AD (Pastarino et al. 2004 ). However, c-secretase is not an ideal therapeutic target because it is also responsible for the cleavage of a number of other important cellular proteins involved in signaling processes. Thus, b-secretase, or b-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE), is a more attractive therapeutic target (Parsons and Austen 2007) . Chang et al. (2007) showed that immunization of transgenic AD mice (Tg2576) with BACE resulted in Ab reduction and cognitive improvement. They suggested that immunization may have resulted in anti-BACE antibodies penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and binding to BACE located on neuronal surfaces, thereby inhibiting enzyme activity. When BACE-antibody complex is endocytosed, BACE cleavage of APP is inhibited by the bound antibody, resulting in a decrease in Ab production. Consequently, immunization with BACE to produce antibodies that neutralize b-secretase activity leading to a reduction in Ab is being considered as a new therapeutic concept for AD. Previously, it was shown that although BACE knockout mice have reduced Ab production, they do not exhibit any abnormal phenotypes (Luo et al. 2001) . The BACE gene was cloned and characterized in 1999 (Vassar et al. 1999) , and various BACE constructs have been expressed in insect (Bruinzeel et al. 2002) , mammalian , and E. coli cells (Sardana et al. 2004; Tomasselli et al. 2008) .",

The recombinant protein yield can be dramatically increased, especially in tobacco, because a leaf cell contains as many as 100 chloroplasts, with up to 100 genomes each; a total of approximately 10,000 plastome copies per cell. Biopharmaceutical compounds, such as human somatotropin (Staub et al. 2000) , human papillomavirus L1 protein (Fernandez-San Millan et al. 2008) , the B-subunit of the cholera toxin (CTB) (Daniell et al. 2001a) , and the tetanus toxin (Tregoning et al. 2005) , have been expressed at high levels (4-25% of TSP). Additionally, environmental concerns regarding transgene escape via pollen from nuclear transgenic plants is abrogated by chloroplast transformation due to the maternal inheritance of plastids in most cultivated plants ( Molina et al. 2004) .",

Following analysis of these transgenic plants, the human BACE was shown to accumulate to levels of 0.12-0.19% of total soluble protein (TSP). Low levels of heterologous protein accumulation in plants is regarded as one of the limiting factors in the commercialization of plant-derived vaccines. Here, we introduced a human BACE gene into the plastome of tobacco plants to increase transgenic protein accumulation. Tobacco plants produce a large biomass, yielding approximately 170 metric tons of biomass per hectare (Fischer and Emans 2000) . Tobacco, a nonfood and non-feed crop, is selfpollinating, thus minimizing transgene escape. Most importantly, we chose tobacco because it is a model plant for plastid transformation and is closely related to potato and tomato plants. In the current study, we report on the integration and expression of the human BACE gene in the plastome. The accumulation levels and antigenicity of the BACE protein derived from transplastomic tobacco were analyzed by western blot or ELISA. The immunogenic responses of tobacco plastid-derived BACE were observed by oral application in test mice. We discuss the potential use of plastid-derived BACE antigen as a new oral vaccine against AD. This may be the first step toward developing a plant-based vaccine against AD.",

Human BACE was amplified from the pET19b/BACE22460 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Inhee Mook-Jung at Seoul National University, Korea) with two primers: forward primer (5 0 -TTtctagaAGGAGGTATAACA ATG ACC CAG CAC GGC ATC CGG-3 0 ), which included an XbaI restriction site and a start codon (underlined); reverse primer (5 0 -GCCCtctagaTTA ATA GGC TAT GGT CAT GAG-3 0 ), which included an XbaI restriction site and a stop codon (underlined). A single amplification product of the expected size of BACE was purified and subcloned into the TOPO TA plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The BACE gene was connected by a linker sequence (5 0 -AGA AGG AGG TAT AAC A-3 0 ) including the rbs (consensus ribosome binding site GGAGG to enhance translation of BACE) to the 3 0 end of the antibiotic resistance gene aadA.",

A 0.3 kb PCR-amplified product was detected in all plants, including Wt ones, and a 3.0 kb PCR-amplified product was detected in the eight transformed primary tobacco lines but not in Wt tobacco (Fig. 1b) . This indicated that the gene of interest had integrated into the plastome of the transgenic tobacco and that the lines were heteroplasmic for the transgene insertion. Four homoplasmic lines (B5, C7, E10, and H3) were obtained following two further rounds of regeneration under selection from four primary regenerated shoots (2, 3, 5, and 7, respectively). Correct integration of the BACE gene into the plastome of the four homoplasmic lines was confirmed by Southern blot analysis.

The blot was probed with the BACE coding region probe which only hybridized the 7.4 kb BglII fragment in the transgenic lines (Fig. 2b) . These results confirmed that the human BACE gene had integrated into the plastome of the transformants through homologous recombination in the trnI-trnA region. BACE gene transcription in the chloroplast was analyzed by northern blot analysis. The expected length of the aadA::BACE dicistronic transcript was approximately 2.0 kb (0.7 kb for aadA and 1.3 kb for BACE). The BACE probe detected a major transcript of approximately 2 kb, indicating that the BACE gene was dicistronically expressed in transplastomic plants (Fig. 2c) . A second major transcript (4.7 kb) hybridizing to the BACE gene probe is attributed to transgene transcription via read-through from the endogenous 16S rRNA promoter (Jeong et al. 2004; Sugita and Sugiura 1996) .",

We checked the growth pattern of normal, means non-immunized, mice as control group. There was no difference in growth between the non-immunized mice (data not shown) and those immunized with Wt tobacco extracts (Fig. 4b) . These findings indicate that oral delivery of plastid-derived BACE was immunogenic in mice.

Thus, a therapeutic agent that could fundamentally inhibit the degeneration of neurons by inhibiting the production and toxicity of Ab would be a highly effective means of preventing and treating AD. Ab is produced by the cleavage actions of bsecretase (BACE) and c-secretase during an amyloidogenic metabolic process. b-secretase inhibition may prevent dementia; this would be more efficient and economical than removing previously formed Ab. Therefore, b-secretase inhibition through vaccination is presently receiving increased attention worldwide (McConlogue et al. 2007 ).",

            "text": "In the present study, attempts were made to achieve high level expression of human BACE in tobacco plants via chloroplast transformation. Following particle bombardment with the CtVBACE construct and after three rounds of selection, four transplastomic tobacco lines were obtained. Western blot confirmed that plastid-derived BACE protein was recognized by an antibody specific to human BACE, and ELISA analysis estimated BACE protein accumulation in transgenic lines at approximately 2.0% of TSP. This is much higher than the BACE yield from nuclear transformed potato tuber or tomato fruit, estimated at 0.12-0.19% of TSP (Youm et al. unpublished data) . However, the level of plastid-based BACE accumulation achieved in this study is lower than what can be expected from chloroplast transformation. The chimeric CTB-2L21 protein was accumulated in tobacco chloroplasts to levels up to 31.1% of TSP (Molina et al. 2004) , and the tetanus fragment C toxin to levels of 10-25% of TSP (Tregoning et al. 2005) . Furthermore, PA/g for anthrax was accumulated in plastid-transformed plants at levels up to 2.5 mg g -1 fresh weight (Watson et al. 2004 ). However, other antigens such as FMDV VP1 protein (2.0-3.0% of TSP [Li et al. 2006a, b] ), HPV L1 (up to 1.5% of TSP [Lenzi et al. 2008 ]), and SARS-CoV S1 protein (approximately 0.2% of TSP [Li et al. 2006a, b] ) accumulated in transplastomic plants at levels that were similar to, or lower than, those achieved for BACE protein in our study. These markedly different expression levels may be due to the type of antigen being expressed, post-transcriptional events and/or protein stability in plastids. Herz et al. (2005) reported that protein expression in the plastid depended on several factors including the types of transformation vectors, promoter and translational control elements used, and external factors like plant age or light intensity. Therefore, the levels of BACE expression achieved in this study may be attributable to some of these various factors.",

The E. coli-derived BACE has a molecular mass of *60 kDa, whereas the plastid-derived BACE has a 48 kDa since the transmembrane domain was removed. From this result, we could estimate that the protein size of the chloroplast-derived BACE was not changed due to post-translational process. Chloroplasts have the ability to process eukaryotic proteins, including correct folding of subunits and formation of disulfide bridges (Staub et al. 2000; Daniell et al. 2001b) , result in fully functional recombinant protein. In the present study, although we have not analyzed the glycosylation status of the chloroplast-derived BACE protein, the recombinant BACE was immunologically active. BACE expression in tobacco chloroplasts did not affect plant growth rate, flowering, or seed set, and there was no apparent morphological difference between transplastomic and Wt tobacco plants in the greenhouse (data not shown). This observation concurs with previous reports where transplastomic tobacco plants expressing CTB (Daniell et al. 2001a) or ETEC (Kang et al. 2004) had no pleiotropic effects compared to Wt plants.",

The trnI and trnA genes were used as flanking sequences for homologous recombination. The aadA gene conferring spectinomycin resistance was used for selection of transgenic shoots. The aadA and BACE gene were regulated by the rrn promoter (Prrn) and the 3 0 -UTR of psbA gene (TpsbA) elements. A synthetic ribosome binding site (rbs) was used to achieve translation of BACE. PCR primers are marked as FI and RA with short lines and BglII restriction sites are indicated with the expected size. b Analysis of primary transplastomic plants carrying the human BACE gene integrated into the plastome. Targeted integration of the aadA/BACE expression cassette is indicated by a 3.0 kb product generated from all 8 primary transformed lines; Wt-genomic DNA from non-transformed tobacco plants was used as a negative control antibody (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).",
