            "text": "International air travel is increasingly affecting the epidemiology of infectious diseases. A particular public health, economic, and political concern is the role of air travel in bringing infectious passengers or vectors to previously non-endemic areas. Yet, little research has been done to investigate either the infection risks associated with air travel or the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of infection control measures on aircraft and at borders. We briefly review the interface between international and national legislation, policy, and guidelines in the context of existing infection risks and possible scenarios. We have found that public health guidance and legislation, which airlines are required to follow, are often contradictory and confusing. Infection control measures for air travel need to be underpinned by coherent and enforceable national and international legislation that is based on solid epidemiological evidence. We recommend further research investment into more effective on-board vector control, health screening, and risk communications strategies, and the development of enforceable and harmonised international legislation.

The number of journeys taken by passengers each year has grown from approximately 642 million in 1980 to more than 3\u00b74 billion in 2015. 1 The epidemiology of infectious diseases associated with air travel and the challenges of infection control are important public health concerns, yet they are scarcely discussed in the literature. 2 Aircraft can now travel to almost any part of the world within 24 h, and can enable spread of infection either by inflight infection transmission or by transporting infectious passengers or vectors-eg, malaria-infected mosquitoes-from endemic to non-endemic regions, thus putting populations in destination countries at risk. The combination of rising passenger numbers, new travel destinations, and on-board transmission events can influence transmission patterns of several imported diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola virus disease. 3 For example, the ongoing transmission of Zika virus disease is believed to have been introduced to the Americas by air travel. 4 Management of these risks requires knowledge of the dynamics of infectious disease transmission and the potential effectiveness of control measures, suggesting that frontline employees (eg, airline staff) would need appropriate training to handle suspected disease cases.",

For example, the value of entry screening measures has been questioned, 9, 10 while an evaluation of border entry screening measures in several countries concluded that a combination of communication methods (eg, in the form of pre-flight health information, in-flight videos, and clinical guidance) for passengers and clinicians might be a more effective strategy for global infectious disease control. 11 Collectively, the unique dynamics and interactions at play in an aircraft environment require a distinct response to infectious disease control.",

Indirect transmission on an airplane can occur through infectious droplets (eg, influenza virus), through contaminated surfaces or objects (eg, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), or Long-distance air travel in particular exposes passengers to several factors that could affect disease transmission. The transmission characteristics of a pathogen, ambient climatic conditions, time spent on board, and aircraft type can affect quantification of the general transmission risk. 13 Absolute figures for the risk of in-flight disease transmission are therefore not readily available and the evidence base is inadequate. 14 Mangili and Gendreau 2 reported in-flight transmission of influenza, SARS, tuberculosis, measles, smallpox, and other pathogens. On a 3 h flight from Hong Kong to Beijing in 2003, 16 of 120 passengers were infected with the SARS virus by a single ill passenger, 15 while modelling has demonstrated the possibility of in-flight transmission of MERS coronavirus. 16 Protective measures are in place in modern aircraft, but these measures are not necessarily as robust as assumed. For example, commercial aircraft use highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters to restrict exposure to small airborne particles. However, there are no regulations requiring that HEPA filters be in place, and little testing has taken place to assess the effectiveness of these filters. 17",

Brownstein and colleagues 21 demonstrated the effect of air travel on the global spread of seasonal influenza, noting that decreased air traffic following the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001 , was associated with a delayed influenza season. Maloney and Cetron 22 documented the air-travel-associated transmission of meningococcal disease. Global air travel could spur the spread of epidemics by bringing viruses and parasites to new areas. 23 Infected mosquitoes on intercontinental flights are believed to have contributed to the global spread of malaria. 23, 24 West Nile virus is widely suspected to have been spread to the USA by an infected mosquito carried by plane. 24 Similarly, the introduction of Zika virus to the Americas coincided with an upsurge of air travel to Brazil from endemic countries in 2013. 4 Management of the risk of transporting infected passengers requires knowledge of transmission dynamics and the potential effectiveness of airport entry and exit screening measures, the ability to appropriately isolate or quarantine individual passengers on an aircraft, and adequately trained aircrew who are able to identify signs of infection and take appropriate measures. For example, WHO maintains that the risk of vector-borne diseases being transmitted aboard aircraft is low, 25 but recommends aircraft disinsection (a public health measure involving insecticide treatment of aircraft interiors and holds), 25 stating that \"there have been frequent instances of insects of public health importance being introduced from one country to another, with occasional dire consequences\". 23 However, the effectiveness of disinsection is unclear. 26 Minimisation of the risk of inadvertently carrying insect vectors requires consistent use of effective control measures, including insecticides that are safe for frequent aircrew and passenger exposure.",

Following the SARS epidemic, IATA recommended that all air carriers create an emergency response plan for public health emergencies, but these are only guidelines and legislative powers lie with national authorities. 5 Airlines face conflicting obligations, since they must comply with infectious disease controls in both origin and destination countries. 28 Airlines owe a duty of care to three different groupspassengers, aircrew, and destination country populations-and these duties sometimes conflict. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency prohibits usage of some insecticides because of potential risks to aircrew, whereas national laws in Australia and New Zealand require usage of these insecticides. US airlines flying to these countries must purchase insecticides at stopovers, and airline unions have raised serious concerns about the \"inconsistent and inappropriate application\", toxicity, and potential adverse health effects of these agents. 29 Other airlines have reported difficulties in aircraft storage of aerosol insecticides that were either banned or prohibited from import in some destination countries. 30 Additionally, doubt exists as to the effectiveness of disinsection, with research identifying increasing resistance of mosquitos to insecticides. 26 Although the ICAO encouraged more research into non-chemical disinsection procedures in 2013, 31 procedures have not changed and airplane disinsection policies and implementation remain inconsistent worldwide.",

Considerable debate continues about the effectiveness and practicality of screening passengers at entry, exit, or both.

Even if transmission time can be proven, airlines can defend the extent to which they should have been expected to identify the risk. They can argue that liability should lie with the infectious passenger who took the flight without notifying the airline or health authorities. 35 Although industrial injury claims have been brought on behalf of aircrew for alleged adverse reactions to constant insecticide exposure in aircraft, these claims have been defended on the basis that airlines were following WHO guidelines. 36, 37 The Montreal Convention does not apply to individuals in a destination country who could become infected by a passenger or imported vector.

He recalled no specific symptoms before boarding, but claimed he had been feeling generally unwell since his arrival from Abuja, an interim stopover on his itinerary that had originated in Kampala 2 days earlier. About 3 h into the flight, his symptoms worsened and the cabin supervisor requested medical assistance. As there was no doctor on board, a nurse examined the passenger and, suspecting he might be infectious, advised the crew to \"isolate him as a precautionary measure\". The passenger was taken to a seat near the galley and looked after by two crew members for the remainder of the flight. Meanwhile, he had violent bouts of vomiting and became increasingly disoriented. The cabin supervisor notified the chief pilot of a sick passenger, but did not communicate the severity of his condition. The pilot assumed the situation was controlled and did not contact US health authorities. Upon landing, the passenger's condition had deteriorated and an ambulance was requested.

Third, additional research and investment into airport health screening measures is required to better identify infectious passengers. Disease transmission can be minimised if passengers take appropriate precautions before or during a flight, or refrain from flying altogether when ill. Current education and communication strategies (and refund policies for missed flights) therefore warrant improvement. Fourth, these measures cannot be implemented in the absence of enforceable and harmonised international legislation and governance. Achieving this goal will be a major challenge, but a starting point could be for international or regional bodies-such as WHO or the European Union-to produce model legislation or standards for the guidance of member states. Close consultation with IATA and ICAO would be required to develop such legislation or guidance.
