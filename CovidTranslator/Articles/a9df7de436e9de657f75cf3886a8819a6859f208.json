No vaccines, chemotherapeutics or antibodies are presently available for preventing or treating hMPV infections. In this study, a bovine/human chimeric parainfluenza virus type 3 (b/h PIV3) expressing the human parainfluenza type 3 (hPIV3) fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins was engineered to express hMPV fusion (F) protein from the second genome position (b/h PIV3/hMPV F2) with the goal of generating a novel hMPV vaccine. b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 was previously shown to protect hamsters from challenge with wt hMPV (Tang RS, Schickli JH, Macphail M, Fernandes F, Bicha L, Spaete J, et al. Effects of human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus antigen insertion in two 3' proximal genome positions of bovine/human parainfluenza virus type 3 on virus replication and immunogenicity. J Virol 2003;77:10819-28) and is here further evaluated for efficacy and immunogenicity in African green monkeys (AGMs). AGMs immunized intranasally and intratracheally with b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 generated hMPV-and hPIV3-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and were protected from wt hMPV infection. In a separate study, the host-range restriction of b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 replication relative to wt hPIV3 was performed in rhesus monkeys to demonstrate attenuation. These studies showed that b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 was immunogenic, protective and attenuated in non-human primates and warrants further evaluation in humans as a vaccine candidate for prevention of hMPV-associated respiratory tract diseases.",

The clinical syndrome associated with hMPV infection is similar to that observed for RSV infection ranging from mild respiratory illness to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [1, 5, 7] . The impact of hMPV infections appears to be greatest for infants, the elderly and the immunocompromised [5] [6] [7] 16, 17] similar to populations at-risk for severe RSV infections. Seven to twelve percent of respiratory tract illnesses in young children can be attributed to hMPV infection [5, 16] although the hMPV-associated disease rate was lower (4.5%) in young and elderly adults [17] . The full extent of disease burden and health care costs associated with hMPV infections are still undetermined. A live attenuated hMPV vaccine would be an appropriate addition to the vaccines currently under development against other pediatric respiratory tract diseases caused by hRSV and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3) [18, 19] .",

Therefore, vaccination strategies against hMPV infections must be effective against both groups of hMPV. Comparison of hMPV sequences from Europe, Asia and South America showed no geographic clustering or antigenic drift between the A and B viruses [21] . hMPV-infected ferret and hamster sera neutralized homologous group viruses better than viruses belonging to the heterologous group [21, 22] . This effect was also observed for African green monkey (AGM) sera [22, 23] . However, hamsters and AGMs infected with hMPV from one group were effectively protected when challenged with heterologous group hMPV [22, 23] .",

The hMPV F protein is thus likely to be the major antigen that induces cross-protection in hamsters and AGMs [23] . We have previously shown that a chimeric PIV3 virus [25, 26] expressing the hMPV/NL/1/00 F protein (b/h PIV3/hMPV F2), elicited hMPV serum neutralizing antibodies and protected hamsters from homologous hMPV challenge [27] .

AGMs are highly permissive for both hMPV [22, 23] and PIV3 [28] infections and provide a good model for assessing the immunogenicity and efficacy of the b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 vaccine candidate. For this reason, the host-range restricted replication of bPIV3, and its derivatives relative to hPIV3, cannot be evaluated in AGMs. However, the restricted replication of bPIV3 compared to hPIV3 was previously demonstrated in the respiratory tract of chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys and this attenuation phenotype was shown to correlate with the safety profile of bPIV3 in human infants [29] [30] [31] [32] . We have previously shown that rbPIV3, the virus vector was restricted in replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys compared to hPIV3, and that replacement of the bovine PIV3 F and HN gene with human PIV3 F and HN resulted in an intermediate level of attenuation [33] . Here, we compared the replication of the chimeric b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 virus with wt hPIV3, recombinant bPIV3 (rbPIV3) and a bovine parainfluenza virus expressing the human PIV3 F and HN genes (b/h PIV3) in the respiratory tract of rhesus monkeys. The results of our studies in African green and rhesus monkeys indicated that b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 elicited hMPVand hPIV3-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and was efficacious and attenuated. Thus, further evaluation of this vaccine candidate in humans is warranted to assess its potential as a pediatric vaccine for prevention of respiratory tract diseases caused by hMPV.",

The strategy presented here utilized an attenuated PIV3 virus vector to deliver the hMPV F protein with the aim of inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immunity against hMPV infection. This vectored approach has previously been shown to generate promising hRSV vaccine candidates [18, 19] as well as to other respiratory pathogens such as measles virus [36] and the SARS coronavirus [37] .",

            "text": "Two main genetic lineages of hMPV have been identified and immunization strategies must address questions about cross-protection between the two major groups of hMPV. Results from animal studies suggest that infection with one group of hMPV can provide cross-protection against infections by other hMPV subgroups [21] [22] [23] . The hMPV F protein that is highly conserved among the different lineages of hMPV, is sufficient to provide protection in animals against hMPV infection in the absence of the other hMPV surface glycoproteins, such as G and SH [23, 27] . Furthermore, exposure to the hMPV F protein from group A hMPV protected animals from infection with group B hMPV [23] . In the present study, we did not challenge b/h PIV3/hMPV F2-immunized animals with subgroup B hMPV. However, sera from b/h PIV3/hMPV F2-and hMPV/NL/1/00-infected AGMs showed a rise in neutralization titer against hMPV/NL/1/99, about 40% of that seen with hMPV/NL/1/00. This level of cross-neutralization against hMPV/NL/1/99 was also seen in previous animal studies with wt hMPV/NL/1/00-infected hamsters and AGMs [22, 23] . Despite lower titers of crossneutralization antibodies against heterologous group hMPV, effective protection against heterologous group hMPV challenge were observed in hamsters and AGMs [22, 23] . In this study, b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 was shown to elicit hMPV-specific as well as virus-specific antibodies and T cell responses in AGMs that received the vaccine virus. The hMPV-specific T cell response was lower in AGMs immunized with b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 compared to hMPV/NL/1/00-infected animals likely because only one hMPV antigen was expressed by the chimeric virus. Cellular immune responses have been demonstrated in human RSV infection [38] and are thought to contribute to clearing of RSV infection in mice [39, 40] . It is likely that cell-mediated immunity also contributes to the effective protection and cross-protection against the different hMPV strains. Although sera from AGMs infected with b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 expressing a group A hMPV F glycoprotein showed lower neutralization titers against a group B hMPV/NL/1/99, the presence of both humoral and cellular immune responses suggest that the vaccinated AGMs may also be protected against group B hMPV infections.",

            "text": "A question of considerable interest in using virus vectors for delivery of antigens is whether the host will develop immunity to the vector itself. This is important not only for using the same vector to deliver different antigens for sequential vaccinations but also to fulfill the need for boosting in the event that the primary vaccination is insufficient to induce lasting protective immunity. The second point is particularly relevant when the target population is young infants because they have undeveloped immune systems and may need multiple doses to stimulate a robust protective response. It is not clear how long the immune response to hMPV and/or hPIV3 will persist in AGMs. It has been reported that PIV3 humoral immunity can last up to 4 months in hamsters [41] . We were unable to detect any decay in PIV3 HAI antibody titer or hMPV neutralizing antibody titers in hamsters 6 months after immunization with 10 2 pfu or 10 3 pfu of b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 (data not shown). The apparent long-term immunity seen in hamsters may not reflect the immune status of PIV3 infections in young infants. A recent hPIV3 clinical trial in young infants showed that multiple doses of an attenuated hPIV3 did not result in inhibitory vector immunity provided the intervals between dose administrations were timed appropriately [42] . Only 24% of infants shed virus when a second dose of vaccine was administered 1 month later. In contrast, 62% of infants shed virus after the second dose when the interval between the primary and secondary dose was 3 months. Thus, a boosting regimen that maximizes both vaccine take and duration of immunity in young infants should be >1 month but <3 months. Maternally-derived HAI serum antibody titers as high as 5.7 log 2 in 4-12 week-old infants did not appear to interfere with the replication of an attenuated hPIV3 (cp-45) vaccine strain [42] . Since we have now shown sufficient efficacy, immunogenicity and attenuation of b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 in primate models, it might be interesting to test the effect of boosting on the ability of b/h PIV3/hMPV F2 to more effectively protect the URT of AGMs against hMPV challenge.",

Indeed it was shown that bPIV3 isolated from seronegative children was phenotypically stable and retained the host-range restricted replication in rhesus monkeys [31] . The stability of the inserted hMPV F has not been tested in vivo. However, b/h PIV3/RSV F2 an identical PIV3 vector expressing the RSV F gene at the second genome position, was found to retain RSV F expression after four serial passages in the respiratory tract of hamsters.
