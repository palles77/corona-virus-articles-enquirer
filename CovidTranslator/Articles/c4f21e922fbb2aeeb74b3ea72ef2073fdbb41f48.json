To assess the effect of IL-13 on primary RSV infection, transgenic mice which either overexpress IL-13 in the lung (IL-13 OE) or non-transgenic littermates (IL-13 NT) were challenged intranasally with RSV. IL-13 OE mice had significantly decreased peak viral titers four days after infection compared to non-transgenic littermates. In addition, IL-13 OE mice had significantly lower RSV-induced weight loss and reduced lung IFN-g protein expression compared with IL-13 NT mice. In contrast, primary RSV challenge of IL-13 deficient mice resulted in a small, but statistically significant increase in viral titers on day four after infection, no difference in RSV-induced weight loss compared to wild type mice, and augmented IFN-g production on day 6 after infection. In STAT1-deficient (STAT1 KO) mice, where primary RSV challenge produced high levels of IL-13 production in the lungs, treatment with an IL-13 neutralizing protein resulted in greater peak viral titers both four and six days after RSV and greater RSV-induced weight loss compared to mice treated with a control protein. These results suggest that IL-13 modulates illness from RSV-infection.",

Vaccination of mice with either the secreted RSV G glycoprotein or formalin-inactivated alum-precipitated RSV leads to Th2 immune responses characterized by augmented IL-5 and IL-13 expression with greater illness and pathology, decreased viral clearance, and heightened pulmonary eosinophilia with subsequent RSV challenge [1, 2] . Recent data from our group reveal that blocking IL-13 activity inhibits formalin-inactivated RSV-induced immune responses [2] , and that IL-13 is sufficient for RSV G glycoprotein-induced eosinophilia after RSV challenge [4] . However, the role of IL-13 in the immune response to primary RSV challenge is not fully described.",

IL-13 is a critical cytokine in allergic responses [6] , and the interaction between allergic lung inflammation and RSV infection in causing airway dysfunction is of great importance in clinical medicine [7] . In addition, IL-13 is reported to be responsible for RSV-induced airway hyperresponsiveness [8, 9] . IL-13 has many of the same immunomodulatory properties as IL-4, partly because both cytokines signal through the IL-4 receptor a-chain [5] . Previously, our group found that IL-4 significantly delayed RSV clearance which was associated with suppression of the development of virus-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes [10] , suggesting that IL-13 might have a similar effect. However, IL-13 plays a more critical role in immunity to the gastrointestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and the intracellular parasite Leishmania major than IL-4 [11, 12] , highlighting divergent phenotypic effects of these cytokines in in vivo models of infection.",

In these experiments, we studied RSV infection in mice that overexpressed IL-13 (IL-13 OE) in airway epithelium [13] and in mice in which the IL-13 gene was deleted (IL-13 KO) [14] , both from a C57BL/6 background. We also examined the role of IL-13 in RSV immunity by administering a soluble IL-13 receptor (sIL-13Ra) to RSV-infected STAT1 knock-out (STAT1 KO) mice of a BALB/c background. RSV infection in STAT1 KO mice of the BALB/c background elicits a mixed Th2/Th1 response with high levels of IL-13, while wild type BALB/c mice have a predominant Th1 immune response to RSV infection with high levels of interferon (IFN)-g and extremely low or undetectable levels of IL-13 [15] . Comparison of the immune response of these three different models of RSV infection reveals that elevation of IL-13 levels in IL-13 OE mice results in decreased peak viral titers and protects against illness while decreasing lung IFN-g levels. In contrast, RSV infection in IL-13 KO mice or in STAT1 KO mice in which the sIL-13Ra was administered results in higher peak viral tiers, delayed clearance, and augmented IFN-g production in the lung.",

The IL-13 OE mice used in the experiments were heterozygous for the IL-13 OE transgene and non-transgenic littermates (IL-13 NT) were used as controls. Both the IL-13 OE and IL-13 NT were maintained on water until transgene activation was desired; at that time, doxycycline (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the animal's drinking water and sucrose (2%) was also added to mask the bitter taste of doxycycline [13] . After four days of treatment with doxycycline, the average IL-13 level was 357 AE 26 pg/ml in the ground lung homogenates of four IL-13 OE mice, while the average IL-13 level was 151 AE 13 pg/ml in four IL-13 OE mice treated with the vehicle. The IL-13 levels were undetectable in ground lung supernatants of the IL-13 NT, whether or not they were treated with doxycycline. Therefore, given that IL-13 OE produced some IL-13 when they were not treated with doxycycline, both the IL-13 OE and IL-13 NT mice were treated with doxycycline to avoid the confounding effect of doxycycline treatment in some groups and not in others.",

However, we did not find differences in either SP-A or SP-D protein levels in BAL fluid from either IL-13 NT-MOCK or IL-13 OE-MOCK, nor between the IL-13 NT-RSV and IL-13 OE-RSV groups.

Inducible overexpression of IL-13 prior to RSV infection decreased viral titers, diminished lung IFN-g production, and protected against RSV-induced weight loss. In contrast, mice which express no IL-13 have higher viral titers and increased IFN-g production, while there is no effect of RSV-induced weight loss. Furthermore, administration of a sIL-13Ra to STAT1 KO mice that express IL-13 with primary RSV challenge leads to increased viral titers, prolonged IFN-g expression and greater RSV-induced weight loss. In these experiments, we therefore found that IL-13 was inversely related to viral titers. Diminished viral antigen load probably abrogated the need for a strong adaptive immune response with resultant decreased IFN-g production in the lung. The absence of IL-13 increased viral load by a yet unknown mechanism, resulting in a greater requirement for adaptive immunity to clear virus, hence the increase in lung IFN-g levels. These results suggest that IL-13 modulates the immune response to RSV infection.",

In vitro studies reveal varying effects of IL-13 on anti-viral immunity depending on the virus studied. Primary blood-derived human macrophages that are exposed to IL-13 decrease the infection and replication of HIV-1 [20] . IL-13 blocks the completion of reverse transcription, thus decreasing virus production, and diminishes the infectivity of the progeny virus [21] . In addition, IL-13 induced a 50% reduction in the number of the CD4 and CCR5 binding sites and completely inhibited surface expression of CXCR4 [22] . CD4 is the HIV receptor, while CCR5 and CXCR4 are coreceptors [22] ; these are not known to be receptors for RSV. IL-13 also protects bronchoalveolar macrophages from productive infection with HIV-1 [23] . While HIV-1 production is strongly inhibited in alveolar macrophages treated with IL-13, IL-13 treatment increases human cytomegalovirus expression in these same cells [24] .",

In this study, a clinical isolate from the University of Michigan was used, not strain A2. Using this clinical isolate, RSV-induced IL-13 was associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and airway epithelial mucus production, features which were blocked by the administration of anti-IL-13 antibody [9] . These investigators also found that RSV-infected mice treated with anti-IL-13 antibodies had significantly reduced viral antigen levels in lung homogenates as measured by an ELISA specific for RSV proteins, but they did not measure PFU in this study [9] . They also did not measure the effect of anti-IL-13 on IFN-g production.",

These studies used human RSV long strain, type A that was purified in sucrose gradients [25] . In these experiments, they used two protocols, one examining IL-13 KO mice on a BALB/c background and another using wild type BALB/c mice with the same sIL-13Ra reagent used in our study [25] . These investigators also found that RSV induced airway epithelial mucus production that was absent in the IL-13 KO mice and inhibited in wild type mice treated with sIL-13Ra [25] . Neither viral titers nor IFN-g were measured in these experiments. In our studies, we have been unable to detect IL-13 with primary RSV (A2 strain) infection in wild type BALB/c mice either by measuring protein in ground lung homogenates nor lung mRNA by RNAse protection assay, nor have we found airway hyperresponsiveness in RSV-infected mice [26] . The differences between the studies of Tekkanat and Lukacs, Park, and our group may be explained by the different RSV strain utilized, preparation of virus stocks, the dose, the route of administration, and the mechanism by which airway responsiveness was measured. In collaboration with the Lukacs group, we recently reported that there are differential immune responses and pulmonary pathophysiology induced by two different A strains of respiratory syncytial virus [27] .",

            "text": "IL-13 and IL-4 induce similar biological functions. This stems from the fact that the IL-4Ra chain is shared by the receptors for both IL-4 and IL-13 [28] , and both trigger the STAT-6 signaling pathway. However, T cells do not express IL-13 receptors [29] , and effects mediated directly by the cytokines on T cell effectors may differ. Studies of tumor surveillance suggest that IL-13 may alter CD8 \u00fe T cell function through an intermediate CD1d-restricted cell type [30] . CD8\u00fe cytolytic function was also increased when IL-13 was inhibited in the setting of recombinant vaccinia infection, but virus titers and illness were not reported [31] . IL-4 has been shown to increase the virulence of poxvirus infection and is associated with a reduction in CTL precursor frequency [32] . IL-4 has also been shown to influence the CTL response to RSV. Overexpression of IL-4 during RSV infection results in delayed virus clearance and enhanced illness, and is associated with abrogated CD8\u00fe cytolytic T cell activity [10] . The effect on CD8 \u00fe T cell function in this setting is related to altered cytolytic function, and does not alter frequency or IFN-g production in CD8 \u00fe T cells [33, 34] . Our current study clearly shows that IL-13 serves a protective role during RSV infection, and does not alter the frequency of IFN-g producing CD8 \u00fe T cells. While RSV-specific cytolytic activity was not measured, the rapid virus clearance ( Fig. 2A) suggests that CD8 \u00fe T cell function was intact. The differences in the effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on the biological function of CD8\u00fe CTL and the consequent impact on virus pathogenesis is likely due to the difference in the specific receptor distribution and the different pattern of cells with STAT-6 activation.",

While constitutive expression of the IL-13 transgene in IL-13 OE mice increased surfactant proteins (SP)-A, -B, and -C twofold, and SP-D was increased 70-fold over levels found in nontransgenic littermates [19] , we found no difference in these surfactant proteins between IL-13 OE mice in which the transgene was induced two days prior to RSV infection and IL-13 NT mice. This is relevant to our model because SP-A and SP-D are collectins that both enhance pulmonary clearance of RSV [35, 36] . We also found that deficiency of IL-13 did alter either SP-A or SP-D levels in BAL fluid; therefore, surfactant regulation of RSV replication does not seem to be the explanation for the IL-13 regulatory effect on RSV-induced immune responses.",

MMP-9 lung expression is induced in IL-13 OE mice [37] . MMP-9 enhanced syncytial formation leading to RSV multiplication and spread, and these effects were blunted by MMP inhibitors [38] . Therefore, this would suggest that IL-13 induces MMP-9 which in turn would increase viral titers. However, in our study, we found that IL-13 overexpression reduced viral titers and IL-13 deficiency increased viral titers, thus it is not clear how the interaction of IL-13 regulation of MMP-9 might be playing a role in viral replication in our in vivo studies. IL-13 also induced expression of cathepsins [39] which are a major factor in endosomal and lysosomal system proteases and are critical in intracellular antigen processing and presentation [40] . Cathepsins have been shown to be essential for murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus type 2 spike-mediated entry [41] and also enhanced entry mediated by the Ebola virus glycoprotein [42] .
