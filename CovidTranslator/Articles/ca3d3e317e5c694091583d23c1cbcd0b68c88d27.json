CedV receptor-binding protein (G) shares only \u223c30% sequence identity with those of NiV and HeV, although they can all use ephrin-B2 as an entry receptor. We demonstrate that CedV also enters cells through additional B-and A-class ephrins (ephrin-B1, ephrin-A2, and ephrin-A5) and report the crystal structure of the CedV G ectodomain alone and in complex with ephrin-B1 or ephrin-B2. The CedV G receptor-binding site is structurally distinct from other henipaviruses, underlying its capability to accommodate additional ephrin receptors. We also show that CedV can enter cells through mouse ephrin-A1 but not human ephrin-A1, which differ by 1 residue in the key contact region. This is evidence of species specific ephrin receptor usage by a henipavirus, and implicates additional ephrin receptors in potential zoonotic transmission.",

HeV and NiV infection spillover events into domestic animals and humans cause severe and often fatal respiratory and neurological disease. These viruses are biosafety level-4-restricted pathogens (3) , and both NiV and HeV remain threats to economically important livestock throughout South Asia and Australia (4) . NiV and henipaviral diseases have been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an epidemic threat needing urgent research and development action, and are included in the WHO R&D Blueprint list of priority pathogens with epidemic potential (5) . The genus Henipavirus also includes Cedar virus (CedV) and 2 candidate sequences, those of Ghana virus (GhV) and M\u00f2ji ang virus (MojV). CedV has several notable characteristics that separate it from HeV and NiV, including a nonpathogenic phenotype in mammalian disease models (6, 7) .",

Henipavirus G proteins are tetramers (dimer of dimers), with each monomer composed of a 6-bladed \u03b2-propeller receptor-binding domain that attaches to the flexible, exposed ephrin-B2, -B3 G protein-binding (G-H) loop (8, (17) (18) (19) .

Zoonoses from wildlife hosts to humans require overcoming barriers that limit cross-species transmission. Successful usage of virus entry receptors represents a bottleneck to zoonosis. Conserved ephrins are recognized entry receptors for henipaviruses like Nipah virus. Here, we characterize the ephrin entry receptor usage of Cedar virus (CedV), a related henipavirus with unknown zoonotic potential that is nonpathogenic in animals known to be susceptible to Nipah and Hendra disease. We discovered that CedV utilizes 4 different ephrins, 3 of which are unique receptors for CedV, and determined that a single natural amino acid difference between human and mouse ephrin-A1 can dictate functional receptor usage.",

Since we previously observed that replication-competent recombinant CedV (rCedV) can enter ephrin-B2-deficient HeLa-USU cells (30), we investigated whether CedV G could interact with other ephrins. We approached this question by coprecipitation of tetrameric soluble CedV G (sG) (35) with a panel of soluble ephrins. Fig. 1A documents that CedV sG coprecipitated ephrin-B2, but not ephrin-B3. Surprisingly, CedV sG coprecipitated ephrin-B1 as efficiently as ephrin-B2. We also detected weak interactions with the A-class ephrins, -A2 and -A5 (Fig. 1A) .",

CHO-K1 cells expressing ephrin-B2 showed the highest fusion activity. Ephrin-B1 sustained similar levels of fusion activity as ephrin-B2, while ephrin-B3 did not support cell-cell fusion (Fig. 2B) . Ephrin-A1, -A2, and -A5 also sustained cell-cell fusion, while ephrin-A3 and -A4 did not (Fig. 2C) . The A-class ephrins were \u223c5-fold less efficient at supporting fusion than the B-class ephrins, as calculated from the level of fusion over the linear portion of the time course (Fig. 2D ). While human ephrin-A1 did not pull down sG (Fig. 1A) , it did sustain low levels of fusion ( Fig. 2 A and D) . It should be noted that while we operated with the tagged ectodomain of ephrin-A1 for the binding assay, we used the authentic full-length protein for the cell-cell fusion assays. Moreover, the split-reporter-based fusion assay is very sensitive, even low-affinity interactions that allow fusion triggering and membrane merger may be detected, and the fusion levels remained consistent within technical replicates and across independent experiments (Fig. 2) .",

We inoculated a recombinant CedV that expresses GFP (rCedV-GFP) (30) on CHO-K1 cells that had been transiently transfected with the relevant ephrins. We observed GFP expression, indicative of cell entry, in cells expressing ephrin-A2, -A5, -B1, or -B2 (Fig. 3A ). More GFPpositive cells were monitored in CHO-K1 cells expressing ephrin-B1 and -B2 compared with cells expressing ephrin-A2 and -A5. In contrast to cell-cell fusion assays ( Fig. 2 A and C), but in agreement with the coprecipitation data ( Fig. 1A) , we did not observe rCedV-GFP infection of ephrin-A1-expressing CHO-K1 cells. Interestingly, we only observed syncytia in CHO-K1 cells expressing ephrin-B1 or -B2 ( Structure of CedV G. The unexpectedly broad receptor utilization by CedV G could be explained by a distinct structure of its receptorbinding site. To gain structural insights into the receptor recognition mechanism, we determined the structures of CedV G by itself and in complex with each of the 2 high-affinity receptors, ephrin-B1 and -B2. The CedV G ectodomain structure was determined at 3.3 \u00c5 resolution (SI Appendix, Table S1 ). Like the other henipavirus G proteins, the CedV G head domain adopts a 6bladed \u03b2-propeller structure (Fig. 4A ). To assess structural similarity, we determined the root-mean-square deviation (R.M.S.D) of all CedV G atoms when superimposed on the previously determined NiV G, HeV G, and GhV G structures (17, 18, 31) . The R.M.S.D.s are 1.360 \u00c5, 1.272 \u00c5, and 1.678 \u00c5, respectively (Fig.  4B) . Interestingly, CedV G has more N-linked glycosylation modifications, and these modifications have different locations, than those of the other G proteins. We observed 8 N-linked glycan moieties at asparagine residues 311, 322, 357, 403, 425, 441, 502, and 562 ( Fig. 4A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ), which is consistent with the prediction (NetNGlyc 1.0 Server). Moreover, we observed 8 disulfide bonds, including C239 to C263, C305 to C318, C310 to C376, C399 to C416, C404 to C520, C514 to C524, C586 to C595, and the long-range bond C212 to C622 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ). Compared with other henipavirus G proteins, an extra disulfide bond, C310 to C376, is located between blade2strand1 and bla-de3strand1\u2032 of the \u03b2-propeller architecture.",

A hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic rim, which were observed in other henipavirus-ephrin interfaces (18, 38) , were also found in the CedV G-ephrin B1/B2 interfaces. The hydrophobic core was formed by inserting the tip of the ephrin G-H loop into the receptor-binding pocket of the G protein, whereas the hydrophilic rim involved multiple hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between either residues K103 and K113 of ephrin-B2 or residues K59 and K113 of ephrin-B1, and residues E522, E576, and E554 of CedV G protein (SI Appendix, Figs.

In the vertical direction, another pocket P4 boundary-forming residue, L305 HeV or Y321 GhV , is replaced by D328 CedV , which points away from the pocket due to the lack of hydrophobic interaction.

It is worth noting that Y121 sterically clashes with pocket P3 of other henipavirus G proteins, preventing ephrin-B1 from being utilized as their receptor (37) . As a consequence of lacking pocket P4, the fourth G-H loop-inserting residue (e.g., W122 ephrin-B2 , M122 ephrin-B1 ) inserts into or stays on top of pocket P3, and is stabilized by CedV G residues P423 and T424. An altered receptor-binding pocket structure therefore underlies CedV G's extraordinary binding compatibility to various ephrin members with diverse G-H loop sequence composition.",

Pi-stacking between Y581 in the NiV G and HeV G P1 pockets and the pocket-inserting aromatic residue (e.g., Y120 in ephrin-B3) is an important stabilizing contact for G-H loop insertion. The substitution of Y581 by N602 in CedV G (Fig.  5B ) abolishes the pi-stacking, reducing the binding compatibility in the P1 pocket. For P1 pocket insertion, tyrosine residue is energetically less advantageous than phenylalanine residue due to addition of a hydroxyl group. Therefore, neither ephrin-B3 nor -A3 with tyrosine at this position of the G-H loop can be effectively utilized by CedV G. Similarly, ephrin-B3 cannot be used by GhV due to the substitution of Y518 NiV by T591 GhV .",

The receptor for MojV is unknown, but ephrin-B2 or -B3 has been experimentally ruled out (43) . Having observed that CedV uses several ephrins as receptors, we compared the 4 key contacting residues of the G-H loop between humans and rodents. Noting a single amino acid difference in the receptor-binding G-H loop between human (T115) and mouse (I115) ephrin-A1 (Fig. 6A) , we assessed whether mouse ephrin-A1 functions as a henipavirus receptor. Indeed, CedV sG coprecipitates soluble mouse ephrin-A1, but not human ephrin-A1 (Fig. 6B) . Further, we recorded minimal binding of CedV sG to human ephrin-A1 (Fig. 6C and Table 2 ; K d = 4,210 nM), while binding to mouse ephrin-A1 was more than 100-fold stronger ( Fig. 6D and Table 2 ; K d = 24.5 nM).",

Mouse ephrin-A1 supported robust cell-cell fusion, while human ephrin-A1 fusion was minimal (Fig. 7 A, Left; mouse A1 [mA1] and human A1 [hA1], respectively). The T115I mutation in human ephrin-A1 increased fusion efficiency, whereas the I115T mutation in mouse ephrin-A1 had the opposite effect (Fig. 7 A, Left; hT115I and mI115T, respectively). Neither HeV nor NiV could use any ephrin-A1 as a receptor (Fig. 7 A, Center and Right, respectively). We then used the split-luciferase reporter assay to quantify fusion function more precisely (Fig. 7B) . Mouse ephrin-A1 supported a rate of fusion that was \u223c7-fold faster than that supported by human ephrin-A1 (Fig. 7C) . The T115I mutation in human ephrin-A1 increased cell-cell fusion to levels similar to those of mouse ephrin-A1 (Fig. 7 B and C, compare mA1 and  hT115I) .

            "text": "Physiologically, ephrin ligands interact with Eph receptors, members of the family of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases governing bidirectional intracellular signaling pathways that regulate developmental processes (49, 50) . For the most part Eph-ephrin interactions are A-or B-class-dependent; however, Eph receptorephrin ligand promiscuity has been observed with EphB2 and EphA4 binding to both A-and B-class ephrins (51) (52) (53) . Similar to these examples of Eph-ephrin interactions, CedV utilizes both ephrin-B1 and -B2 and GPI-linked ephrin-A2 and -A5 as functional receptors, although a delay was observed in infection with A-class ephrins. Thus, ephrin-A2 and -A5 appear to be less efficient CedV receptors compared with ephrin-B1 and -B2, consistent with affinity binding and cell-cell fusion rate analyses. GPIlinked proteins and lipid rafts have been identified as entry and egress sites for several viruses (reviewed in ref. 54); however, the in vivo relevance of A-class ephrin receptor use is unclear at this time as this evidence is being masked by the high-affinity ephrin-B1 and -B2 receptors.",

Bat-borne viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (CoV) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome-CoV provide well-studied examples of how mutations in virus receptors can influence tropism: Murine and human ACE-2 (56-59) and bat DDP4 orthologs (60), respectively, differ in key amino acids, which can influence virus cross-species adaptation. Functional receptor usage of mouse ephrin-A1 by CedV is evidence that henipaviruses utilize ephrin ligands in a species specific manner. A single substitution in the G-H loop (T115I) between human and mouse ephrin-A1 accounts for both binding to and functional use of mouse ephrin-A1 (Figs. 6 and 7) at levels similar to ephrin-B2. Comparable fusion activity between mouse ephrin-A1 and human ephrin-B2 further suggests that the decreased level of fusion activity with human ephrin-A2 and -A5 is a result of CedV G-binding affinities with ephrin-A2 and -A5, and not an effect of the GPI-linked anchor. Since the key henipavirus G-contacting residues in ephrin-B1 and -B2 are conserved in both human and mouse orthologs, disparities between mouse and human ephrin-A1 may not singularly promote a novel murine host switch.",

Ephrin ligand and Eph receptor interactions have major roles in developmental processes like cell migration and axon guidance, and, as a result, some ephrins have overlapping spatial and tissue expression. Notably, a distinct expression pattern of ephrin-B3 in the spinal cord may underlie CNS pathogenesis during HeV and NiV infection (12, 37, 45) . Interestingly, ephrin-B1 is expressed in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex (61), as well as in the spinal cord (62) . However, HeV and NiV are unable to utilize ephrin-B1 as a receptor, while nonpathogenic CedV can efficiently utilize ephrin-B1. Structural comparisons of the GhV G receptor-binding pocket with HeV and CedV G, as presented here, and NiV G (31), additionally, suggest that GhV G would be incapable of accommodating ephrin-B1. Extended receptor usage could be postulated to enhance pathogenicity; however, this is not the case with CedV. Interestingly, the vaccine strain of measles virus has acquired broad tropism due to the use of the ubiquitous receptor CD46, which contributes to its attenuation (63, 64) . Additionally, CedV does not express interferon antagonists V and W proteins, which are expressed by nearly all other paramyxoviruses. Thus, broad receptor usage and a lack of innate immune antagonism may both contribute to a lack of disease outcome from CedV infections. Therefore, both the identification of receptors that mediate cross-species transmission and the study of orthologous virulence factors (e.g., V protein, W protein) that suppress antiviral immune responses (65, 66) will greatly improve our ability to evaluate the public health risk of emerging henipaviruses.",
