Pups born to both naive and immune dams, but nursed by naive foster dams, were susceptible to infection, while naive or immune pups nursed by immune foster dams were protected. The MHV infectious dose was identical among naive pups inoculated at 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks of age. Pups nursing immune dams resisted infection when inoculated at 1, 2, or 3 weeks of age. Three week old pups were protected only if they were allowed access to their immune dams. Pups born to MHV immune dams 4 in consecutive litters acquired equal MHV IgG titers in serum and whey and were all protected against challenge infection. Only pups actively ingesting immune whey at the time of or within two hours after virus inoculation were effectively protected. Pups born to dams immunized by oral inoculation with live MHV acquired both MHV-specific IgA and IgG in their whey, while pups born to dams immunized with killed virus acquired only IgG. Both IgA and IgG, but not IgG alone, were required for complete protection.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses infect many mammalian and avian species, including humans. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the coronavirus of mice, is a highly contagious and mutable virus with numerous antigenically cross-reactive but distinct strains. Like coronaviruses of other species, MHV strains can be divided according to their primary tissue tropism into respiratory and enterotropic strains [3] . Enterotropic MHV is the most common form of natural infection in contemporary mouse colonies, but is the least studied of the two MHV biotypes. It is thus important not only as a natural pathogen of laboratory mice but also as a potential model for enteric coronavirus infections of other species. Epizootics of enterotropic M H V in naive mouse colonies are associated with diarrhea and high mortality a m o n g infant mice. Mice in enzootically infected colonies, on the other hand, show no signs of disease, suggesting that maternallyderived passive immunity protects neonatal mice from disease and possibly even infection [1, 3, 7, 10] . We have previously shown that following an immunizing infection with enterotropic MHV-Y, dams produce MHV-specific IgA and IgG, but not IgM in their whey. Pups born to and nursed by M H V -Y immune dams acquire MHV-specific IgG in their serum and both IgA and IgG in their gastric contents I-9]. IgG can be transferred from mouse d a m to pup in utero via yolk sac receptors, as well as post-natally for two weeks through receptors located on the intestinal mucosa [6] . We have found that maternally-derived IgA is transferred to pups in whey and is restricted to the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract without absorption [9] .",

To evaluate how this change affects protection against infection with enterotropic MHV, pups born to immune and naive dams were challenged at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of age with serial 10-fold dilution doses (101-105 NEDs0) of MHV-Y. They were necropsied at 48 h; serum was collected for EIA and ascending colon samples were collected for histology and virus assay. Based upon both histological evidence of enteritis and detectable virus, different aged pups from naive dams were susceptible to approximately the same infectious dose of MHV-Y (Table 1) . One and two week old pups suckling immune dams were fully protected against infection, even when inoculated with 105 NEDs0 MHV-Y. Unweaned three week old pups of immune dams required a higher infectious virus dose to develop enteritis and detectable virus compared to weaned three and four week old mice, which were as susceptible to MHV-Y infection as non-immune animals of the same age-group ( [9] . To examine if the same is true for intraluminal antibody in the gastrointestinal tract and how it affects protection against challenge infection, pups of the first four litters born to immune and naive dams were inoculated with M H V -Y at one week of age and necropsied 48 h later. Whey and serum were collected for E I A / E L I S A and ascending colon for histology. Since by infecting the pups, dams would become superinfected or boosted immunologically, a separate group of dams was used to evaluate each litter. Naive males were used as sentinels throughout the experiment to detect accidental booster infections with MHV, and none were detected. IgG titers in serum and whey of seven day old pups did not decrease significantly over the course of four consecutive litters ( Table 2 ) . The pups' M H V IgG titers were, however, dependent u p o n their dams' serum M H V IgG titer. M H V IgA titers in the whey seemed to decrease slightly from the first to the fourth litter, but pups from all four litters born to immune dams were completely protected from enteritis after challenge with M H V -Y ( Table 2 ). The next experiment studied the effect of lactogenic passive antibody on ongoing infections with MHV-Y. One week old pups born to i m m u n e or naive dams were inoculated with M H V -Y and transferred to naive or immune dams, respectively, at -24, -12, -2, 0, + 2, + 12, or + 24h relative to inoculation.

Serum and whey were collected for E I A / E L I S A and ascending colon samples for histology and virus assay. Reciprocal geometric mean serum EIA M H V IgG titers of nine dams (3456 :t: 1499 SD) were lower than those of orally infected animals, but comparable to dams having their third or fourth litter ( Table 2 ). The same was true for M H V IgG titers in pup serum (1600 + 883) and whey (141 + 51). No M H V IgA could be detected in any of the samples. Ascending colon histology of pups from 10 different litters (81 pups total) revealed mild nonspecific inflammation (enteritis) in many of the pups, but most cases could not be scored positive due to lack of pathognomonic syncytia. Five of the pups (representing 4 litters) had mild enteritis with demonstrable syncytia which could be definitively scored positive. Syncytia were very rare and less conspicuous in these mice compared to MHV-Y infected, naive mice ( Figs. 1 and 2) . Furthermore, virus could be detected in only 1 of 11 samples tested, including colons from 2 individual pups of 1 litter and pooled colon samples from each of 9 different litters. One pooled Fig. 1 .

The mucosa is nearly normal, with a single small virus-induced syncytium (arrow) in the surface mucosa Fig. 2 . Ascending colonic mucosa of a nine day old mouse suckling a non-immune dam, 48 h after oral MHV-Y challenge. The mucosa has multiple virus-induced syncytia (arrows), the lamina propria is infiltrated with leukocytes and mucin vacuoles in goblet cells are less prominent than normal sample from 1 of the litters was positive. These results indicated no or low levels of replicating virus in these pups.",

These findings were confirmed in the present study with dams that were actively immunized by oral inoculation with enterotropic MHV-Y. This immunization procedure was chosen because it closely mimics the natural infection. Pups born to and nursed by dams that were immunized in this fashion were not only protected from fatal diarrhea, but we also showed they were protected from microscopic evidence of enteritis and were virus-free, based on bioassay of intestinal samples. Cross-foster nursing experiments showed that only the immune status of the dam nursing the pups at the time of infection was relevant for the pups' protection. The pups' systemic serum antibody had no effect on virus replication in their intestine. Passive immunity to enterotropic MHV seemed therefore to be solely dependent on intraluminal MHV IgA and IgG in the gastrointestinal tract of the pups. Furthermore, only intraluminal antibody present at the exact time of infection or up to two hours afterwards was able to neutralize the challenge virus and prevent enteritis and virus replication. In contrast, similar studies with respiratory MHV-JHM have shown that pasive immunity to challenge infection can be conferred by transfer of maternal IgG, and is not dependent upon active ingestion of whey at the time virus challenge [5] . The effectiveness of intraluminal antibody on neutralizing enterotropic MHV was underscored by another observation. Due to the change from milk to solid food at weaning age, pups nursed by immune dams had no detectable MHV-specific antibody in their gastrointestinal tract at that time [9] . When three week old pups from immune dams were challenged with MHV-Y, the group that had been separated from their dam at the time of infection was as susceptible to MHV-Y infection as pups from naive dams of the same age group, but three week old pups that were still suckling their immune dams were less susceptible to infection. Even in undetectable quantities, intraluminal antibody in the gastrointestinal tract of pups suckling immune dams seemed to be able to neutralize low titers of challenge virus.",

This study was able to show that this age-related tendency to fatal diarrhea was not due to an increased susceptibility to enterotropic MHV infection, since all naive pups between one and four weeks of age were equally susceptible to the same infectious dose of MHV-Y, resulting in both enteritis and active virus infection. Pups suckling immune dams were fully protected against virus challenge for the first two weeks postpartum. This would explain why no apparent disease occurs among pups in enzootically infected mouse colonies. Maternally-derived passive immunity protects pups during the critical first two weeks of their lives. In enzootically infected colonies, pups most likely become infected at weaning or shortly thereafter, at an age when maternally derived antibody wanes and susceptibility to disease is minimal. Most mice in commercial breeding colonies give birth to less than eight litters during their lives. Since the protective effect of maternally-derived passive immunity to enterotropic MHV did not diminish over the course of four consecutive litters, one can speculate that immunity caused by the initial infection might effectively protect all pups subsequently born to these animals from fatal diarrhea when infected with the same strain of virus.",

When pups nursed by dams immunized using these different means were challenged orally with MHV-Y, the group that received both IgG and IgA in milk was fully protected, based upon both histology and infectious virus assay. Pups that received only IgG in their milk had evidence of protection against virus challenge, but a few developed mild nonspecific enteritis and those that could be confirmed to be definitely infected based upon the presence of MHV syncytia of enterocytes or demonstrable infectious virus had very mild disease. It can therefore be concluded that while MHV-Y specific IgG has neutralizing capacity, IgA is needed for complete protection from infection.",
