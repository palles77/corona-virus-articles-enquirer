Traditional diagnostic techniques in the microbiology laboratory include growth and isolation of micro organisms in culture, detection of pathogen specific anti bodies (serology) or antigens and molecular identi fication of microbial nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), most commonly via PCR. While most molecular assays target only a limited number of pathogens using specific prim ers or probes, metagenomic approaches characterize all DNA or RNA present in a sample, enabling analysis of the entire microbiome as well as the human host genome or transcriptome in patient samples. Metagenomic approaches have been applied for decades to charac terize various niches, ranging from marine environ ments 1 to toxic soils 2 to arthropod disease vectors 3, 4 to the human microbiome 5, 6 . These tools have also been used to identify infections in ancient remains 7 , discover novel viral pathogens 8 and characterize the human virome in both healthy and diseased states [9] [10] [11] and for forensic applications 12 .",

Some early successes using this technology include the discov ery of the SARS coronavirus 15 , gene profiling of muta tions in cancer 16 and in depth microbiome analysis of different sites in the human body 17 . However, it was the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) techno logies in 2005 that jump started the metagenomics field 18 . For the first time, millions to billions of reads could be generated in a single run, permitting analysis of the entire genetic content of a clinical or environmental sample.

Examples in public health microbiology include the use of NGS, in combination with transmission network analysis 20 , to investigate outbreaks of the Escherichia coli strain O104:H4 (ref. 21 ) and for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in the food supply by bacterial whole genome sequencing 22 . Increasingly, big data provided by mNGS is being leveraged for clinical purposes, including charac terization of antibiotic resistance directly from clinical samples 23 and analysis of human host response (tran scriptomic) data to predict causes of infection and evalu ate disease risk 24, 25 . Thus, mNGS can be a key driver for precision diagnosis of infectious diseases, advancing precision medicine efforts to personalize patient care in this field.",

The spectrum of conventional testing for pathogens in clinical samples ranges from the identification of microorganisms growing in culture (for example, by biochemical phenotype testing or matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time offlight mass spectrometry), the detection of organism specific bio markers (such as antigen testing by latex agglutination or antibody testing by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)) or nucleic acid testing by PCR for sin gle agents to multiplexed PCR testing using syndromic panels. These panels generally include the most common pathogens associated with a defined clinical syndrome, such as meningitis and encephalitis, acute respiratory infection, sepsis or diarrhoeal disease 28-31 .",

            "text": "Molecular diagnostic assays provide a fairly cost effective and rapid (generally <2 hours of turnaround time) means to diagnose the most common infections. However, nearly all conventional microbiological tests in current use detect only one or a limited panel of patho gens at a time or require that a microorganism be suc cessfully cultured from a clinical sample. By contrast, while NGS assays in current use cannot compare with conventional tests with respect to speed -the sequenc ing run alone on a standard Illumina instrument takes >18 hours -mNGS enables a broad range of pathogens -viruses, bacteria, fungi and/or parasites -to be identified from culture or directly from clinical samples on the basis of uniquely identifiable DNA and/or RNA sequences 32 . Another key advantage of NGS approaches is that the sequencing data can potentially be leveraged for additional analyses beyond the mere identification of a causative pathogen, such as microbiome character ization and parallel analyses of human host responses through transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA seq). Thus, the clinical utility of NGS in diagno sis may be in the most difficult todiagnose cases or for immunocompromised patients, in whom the spectrum of potential pathogens is greater. Eventually, mNGS may become cost competitive with multiplexed assays or used as an upfront 'rule out' assay to exclude infec tious aetiologies. Of course, detection of nucleic acids, either by multiplex PCR panels or NGS, does not by itself prove that an identified microorganism is the cause of the illness, and findings have to be interpreted in the clinical context. In particular, discovery of an atypical or novel infectious agent in clinical samples should be Fig. 1 | Clinical applications of metagenomic sequencing. A | Applications in infectious disease diagnostics include direct identification of microorganisms from primary clinical samples (part Aa); antimicrobial resistance prediction by characterization of resistance genes (part Ab); detection of species-level or strain-level virulence determinants, such as secretion of specific endotoxins or exotoxins (part Ac); and antiviral resistance prediction (part Ad). As shown for HIV-1, recovery of the complete viral genome from a patient sample by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) (part Ad, graph) facilitates sequence analysis to predict susceptibility or resistance to antiretroviral drugs (part Ad, bar plot); the susceptibility profile for the analysed strain (black bars) predicts resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) class of drugs (denoted by an asterisk), as opposed to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs). B | Microbiome analyses can inform disease prognosis in acute and chronic disease states and underlie the development of probiotic therapies. Coloured bars represent individual microbiota species. A reduction in species diversity is seen in dysbiosis (an unhealthy state), such as present in patients with Clostridium difficileassociated disease. Stool from healthy individuals can be harvested to treat patients with C. difficile infection by faecal stool transplantation or as orally administered encapsulated faecal pills. Alternatively , synthetic stool generated from microbiota species observed in healthy individuals can be used as probiotics to treat patients. In addition to C. difficile infection, chronic diseases such as obesity , inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes mellitus are potential targets for probiotic therapy. C | RNA-sequencing-based transcriptomics can improve the diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious conditions on the basis of the human host response. Host transcriptomic profiling by NGS can enable the construction of a classifier metric to discriminate between patients with infection (red bars) from uninfected patients (blue bars) with high accuracy (part Ca). Metric scores above the dotted line indicate infection, whereas scores below the dotted line indicate absence of infection; the overall accuracy of the classifier metric shown is 83%. Cluster heat map analysis identifies individual, differentially expressed host genes associated with infection (genes A-F) versus those associated with no infection (genes G-L) (part Cb). D | Sequencing of viral tumours or liquid biopsy analyses in oncology can be used for simultaneous pathogen detection and characterization of host genetic mutations. mNGS can be used to detect Merkel cell polyomavirus, the virus associated with the development of Merkel cell carcinoma. Simultaneous sequencing of host DNA can identify mutations that arise from integration of the viral genome containing the full-length large T antigen (LT) followed by subsequent truncation of the LT antigen (part Da) or truncation of the LT antigen before viral genome integration (part Db). Both of these two mutations lead to cellular transformation that drives tumour proliferation. Although promising, many of these sequencing-based applications have yet to be incorporated into routine clinical practice.

A limitation of mNGS is that the sensitivity of the approach is critically dependent on the level of back ground. Tissues, for example, have increased human host background relative to cell free body fluids, result ing in a reduced number and proportion of microbial reads and hence a decrease in mNGS sensitivity 33, 36, 37 . Moreover, defining specific microbial profiles that are diagnostic or predictive of disease development can be difficult, especially from nonsterile sites that harbour a complex microbiome, such as respiratory secretions or stool 6 .

Interrogation of RNA reads from microorganisms corresponding to active microbial gene expression might enable the dis crimination between infection versus colonization 25 and live (viable) versus dead organisms 79 . Moreover, RNA seq analyses of the human host can be used to identify novel or underappreciated host-microbial interactions directly from clinical samples, as previously shown for patients with Lyme disease 68 , dengue 80 or malaria 81 . RNA seq may be particularly useful in clinical cases in which the causative pathogen is only transiently present (such as early Lyme disease 82 or arboviral infections, including West Nile virus 83 or ZIKV 84 ); analogous to serologic testing, indirect diagnosis of infections may be possible on the basis of a pathogen specific human host response. Analysis of pathogen specific host responses may also be useful in discriminating the bona fide causative pathogen or pathogens in a complex clinical metagenomic sample, such as a polymicrobial abscess or respiratory fluid 25 . Yet another promising applica tion of RNA seq is in discriminating infectious versus non infectious causes of acute illness 25 . If an illness is judged more likely to be non infectious (for example, an autoimmune disease) on the basis of the host response, for example, clinicians may be more willing to discon tinue antibiotics and treat the patient aggressively with steroids and other immunosuppressive medications. As large scale sequencing data continue to be gener ated, perhaps driven by routine clinical mNGS testing, secondary mining of human reads might improve the accuracy of clinical diagnoses by incorporating both microbial and host gene expression data.",

Fig. 2 | Targeted versus untargeted shotgun metagenomic next-generation sequencing approaches. A variety of patient samples, as well as cultured microbial colonies, can be analysed using targeted or untargeted metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) methods for pathogen identification, microbiome analyses and/or host transcriptome profiling. Universal PCR (left) is a targeted mNGS approach that uses primers designed from conserved regions such as the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes that are universally conserved among bacteria (16S or 23S rRNA) or fungi and parasites (18S rRNA , 28S rRNA or internal transcribed spacer (ITS)). Other sets of primers can be designed to target a defined set of pathogens and/or genes and used for multiplex reverse transcription PCR or PCR (multiplexed amplicon PCR). NGS library preparation and sequencing of the resultant amplicons enable pathogen identification down to the genus or species level. Metagenomic sequencing (right) entails unbiased shotgun sequencing of all microbial and host nucleic acids present in a clinical sample. Separate DNA and RNA libraries are constructed; the DNA library is used for identification of bacteria, fungi, DNA viruses and parasites, whereas the RNA library is used for identification of RNA viruses and RNA sequencing-based human host transcriptome profiling (heat map, bottom right). As no primers or probes are used in unbiased mNGS, the vast majority of reads corresponds to the human host and, thus, detection of pathogens from metagenomic libraries is a 'needle-in-a-haystack' endeavour. An optional capture probe enrichment step using magnetic beads enables targeted mNGS of pathogens and/or genes from metagenomic libraries. All these methods are compatible with sequencing on traditional benchtop instruments such as the Illumina HiSeq and portable nanopore sequencers such as the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION. assay need to be validated and shown to have acceptable performance before testing in patients.

The importance of retaining the ability for cell free DNA detection from culture negative samples from dead organisms is also why incorporation of a propidium monoazide treatment step to select for DNA from live organisms may not be clinically useful as an enrichment method for mNGS 102 .

Yet another approach to improve sensitiv ity is to leverage a hybrid method for enrichment, such as metagenomic sequencing with spiked primers 46 . Combining targeted with untargeted sequencing, the method uses variably sized panels (100-10,000) of short primers that are added ('spiked') into reaction mixtures to enrich for specific target organisms while retaining the breadth of metagenomic sequencing for off target organisms. When spiked at the reverse transcription step, a panel of ZIKV specific primers was found to increase the number of ZIKV reads by more than ten fold without appreciably decreasing broad metagenomic sensitivity for other pathogens, enabling whole genome viral sequencing to characterize ZIKV spread from Brazil into Central America and Mexico 46 .",

A next-generation sequencing (NGS) data set, generally in FASTQ or sequence alignment map (SAM) format, is analysed on a computational server, portable laptop or desktop computer or on the cloud. An initial preprocessing step consists of low-quality filtering, low-complexity filtering and adaptor trimming. Computational host subtraction is performed by mapping reads to the host (for example, human) genome and setting aside host reads for subsequent transcriptome (RNA) or genome (DNA) analysis. The remaining unmapped reads are directly aligned to large reference databases, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database or microbial reference sequence or genome collections, or are first assembled de novo into longer contiguous sequences (contigs) followed by alignment to reference databases. After taxonomic classification, in which individual reads or contigs are assigned into specific taxa (for example, species, genus and family), the data can be analysed and visualized in a number of different formats. These include coverage map and pairwise identity plots to determine how much of the microbial genome has been recovered and its similarity to reference genomes in the database; Krona plots to visualize taxonomic diversity in the metagenomic library ; phylogenetic analysis to compare assembled genes, gene regions or genomes to reference sequences; and heat maps to show microorganisms that were detected in the clinical samples.

Prospective clinical studies will be critical to understand when to perform mNGS and how the diagnostic yield compares with that of other methods. For example, the mNGS transcrip tomic approach might enable effective treatment triage, whereby antimicrobials are only needed for patients showing an 'infectious profile' of gene expression and those with a 'non infectious profile' can be treated for other causes. In particular, prospective clinical trial and economic data showing the cost effectiveness of these relatively expensive tests in improving patient outcomes are needed to justify their use. These data will also sup port a pathway towards regulatory approval and clini cal reimbursement. High quality evidence that clinical metagenomic assays are effective in guiding patient management will require protocols that minimize potential assay and patient selection bias and compare relevant health outcomes using data sets generated from large patient cohorts 119, 120 .",

We will witness the widespread democratization of mNGS as genomic analyses become widely accessible not only to physicians and researchers but also to patients and the public via crowdsourcing initiatives 121, 122 . Furthermore, in a world with constantly emerging pathogens, we envisage that mNGS based testing will have a pivotal role in monitor ing and tracking new disease outbreaks. As surveillance networks and rapid diagnostic platforms such as nano pore sequencing are deployed globally, it will be possi ble to detect and contain infectious outbreaks at a much earlier stage, saving lives and lowering costs. In the near future, mNGS will not be a luxury but a necessity in the clinician's armamentarium as we engage in the perpetual fight against infectious diseases.",
