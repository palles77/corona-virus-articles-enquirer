Comfort was evaluated using the COMFORT-behavior scale (CBS) before (T1), during (T2) and after (T3) each nebulization. In order to compare NIPE and CBS values during the whole T1 to T3 period, the variable Dif-CBS was defined as the difference between maximal and minimal CBS scores, and Dif-NIPE as the difference between 75th and 25th percentile NIPE values. Analyses were carried out, firstly for the total of nebulizations and secondly comparing two different nebulization systems: a jet nebulizer (JN) and a nebulizer integrated in high flow nasal cannulas (NHF). 84 nebulizations were recorded on 14 patients with a median [25th-75th percentile] age of 6 months (3.1-9.5). A Dif-CBS of 4 points (2-7), as well as changes in CBS scores between T1 and T2, defined the nebulization as a discomfort stimulus. The NIPE system, represented as the Dif-NIPE, showed a median variation of 9 points (7-10), and was poorly correlated to Dif-CBS [r s 0.162 (P = 0.142)]. Discomfort during nebulization, assessed by CBS was greater with the JN system compared to NHF: 17 (13-22) vs 13 (9-15) (P = 0.001). NIPE monitoring detected no significant differences between both nebulization systems (P = 0.706). NIPE monitoring showed a variation in comfort during nebulization in the patient with bronchiolitis, though correlation with CBS was poor. Further research is required before NIPE can be suggested as a comfort monitoring system for the awake infant.",

However, self-reporting is unlikely in pre-verbal children, as well as in infants with altered consciousness [11] . Regardless of which tool is used to assess pain, perception of pain in pediatrics is complex, and entails physiological, behavioral, and developmental factors [12, 13] , including the limitation of the experience of the examiner. In these instances, a cooperation-independent monitor for pain would be highly helpful [14] . The Newborn Infant Parasympathetic Evaluation (NIPE, MDMS, Loos, France) is a valid non-invasive system in children up to 2 years of age based on the analysis of the respiratory fluctuations of heart rate that mainly reflect variability in the parasympathetic tone [15] . The NIPE monitor records the ECG signal continuously, enabling a quantitative assessment of the respiratory variability of heart rate, which decreases during nociceptive stimulation [16] . To date, only a few studies have focused on this technology in children, the majority of them in the area of anesthesia [17] [18] [19] .",

For quantitative variables, median [25th-75th percentile] were obtained according to nebulization system and time period. Spearman's correlation coefficient (r s ) was used to measure correlation among the CBS (Dif-CBS) and NIPE values (DifNIPE), and nonparametric testing (Mann-Whitney's U test) was used to compare the two nebulization systems in each time period. ANOVA for repeated measures was used when CBS scores were compared during different moments within the same nebulization (T1, T2 and T3) for each of the two nebulization systems (NHC and JN). When Dif-CBS and Dif-NIPE were being compared, a \"patient\" variable was introduced in order to reflect the number of nebulizations administered to each individual patient. Values of P < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.",

The population chosen was infants with bronchiolitis admitted to PICU, with demographics similar to those described in previous studies [22] . The reason for choosing this disease, apart from its elevated incidence, was the frequent use in this group of treatments with potential discomfort, such as nebulizations [23] . In this paper, the results from a smaller previous study are corroborated, since it has been consistently found that nebulizations constitute a scource of discomfort for patients. The degree of this discomfort, as measured using clinical scales, is higher when using a JN system compared to a NHF system [20] . The Comfort Behavior Scale (CBS) was designed for use in pediatric populations with a similar age to the present study [24] , and it is a valid and reliable tool for assessing comfort in critical care pediatric patients [25] .

            "text": "As far as we know, the data presented here are the first regarding the usefulness of the NIPE in children with spontaneous breathing admitted to a PICU with no surgery performed. In the present study, the NIPE appears to be a sensitive tool to detect changes during nebulization, as a variation was detected in the NIPE values of 9 points during nebulization. However, these changes were almost identical between one nebulization system and the other. These results contrast with the variations in comfort that the clinical CBS detected during nebulization, as well as the greater clinical discomfort of the JN nebulization system compared to the NHF [20] . If a score of less than 17 on the CBS scale, like that determined by Van Dijk et al., is taken as a cut-off Fig. 1 The relationship between the difference in comfort levels measured using NIPE (Dif-NIPE) and the difference in comfort levels measured using CBS (Dif-CBS) from T1 to T3. Correlation between Dif-NIPE and Dif-CBS during T1-T3 period was: r s 0.162 (P = 0.142) point for the administration of analgesics [34] , the number of patients with values below 17 during nebulization was significantly higher with JN than with NHF. This lack of correlation between the comfort difference during the nebulization with the NIPE and the measurement with the clinical scales has also been found in adult patients [14, 35] . Furthermore, there could be other explanations for these findings in our study. In the first place, an increase of 4 points was found in the HR compared to the baseline, there being a slight correlation with the change in the clinical CBS. This increase of barely 1% difference from the increase found in other studies supports changes in the HR of 10-25% as a good indicator of nociception [17, 36] . In pediatrics, and in pediatric anesthetics in particular, it is normal practice to monitor changes in HR from baseline as an indicator of pain and discomfort [37, 38] . As such, Migeon et al. showed that ANI measurements decreased after skin incision in children over 2 years of age anesthetized with sevoflurane. This could be used in combination, or as an alternative to HR monitoring [17] . Ledowski et al. observed similar results, concluding that ANI might provide a more sensitive assessment of nociception in anesthetized children than hemodynamic parameters or skin conductance [39] . However, the percentage rise in HR required to identify a painful stimulus in children is debatable, some studies not finding changes in the HR in painful procedures [40, 41] , or even emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting heart rate as an index of comfort [42] . Secondly, we had to exclude a number of NIPE values with Quality '0' which meant not analyzing 18% of the nebulizations. However, the number of nebulizations rejected in each nebulization system was similar; thus this should not be the reason why we did not find any differences between the two nebulizers used.",
