Careful study of affected litters and pedigrees is required to determine the inheritance pattern. Selection processes used by breeders include inbreeding, linebreeding, and outcrossing. While selecting for a particular trait, inbreeding and linebreeding practices result in a reduction of genetic variability and an increase in homozygous and recessive traits. Simple inheritance (Mendelian) patterns have served as the basis for determining modes of inheritance of many genetic disorders. Many of these hereditary diseases have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Dominant traits are more easily eliminated from the breeding pool of a breed by not breeding affected dogs. Determining inheritance pattern is more difficult for polygenetic and complex traits. Polygenetic inheritance refers to when proper development relies on sequential activation of genes or for traits of variable penetrance that result in a variety of phenotypes for a given genotype. Complex traits are determined by the interaction between environment and polygenetic predisposition. Having an understanding of the hereditary basis for these degenerative diseases is important because (1) they are genetic disorders and can be eliminated by selective breeding; (2) they may be confused with conditions of nongenetic origin, such as viral diseases; and (3) they can serve as excellent models of similar human diseases.",

Two groups are commonly recognized: neuronal storage diseases, in which the product accumulates in neurons, and leukodystrophies. 2 In general, leukodystrophy refers to inherited conditions of younger animals in which myelin synthesis or function is defective and cannot be maintained and may include storage disease pathogenesis.

Cerebellar signs are often the first sign of storage diseases because of the complex integration of the fast conducting sensory and motor pathways (see Chapter 8) . 4 The cerebellum also is particularly sensitive to disorders affecting myelin. Seizure events that occur with some storage disorders usually manifest at the end stage of the disease process. Storage disorders for which seizure activity is a predominant clinical feature include ceroid lipofuscinosis, glycoproteinoses, and leukodystrophies. 4 Most of the diseases that have been studied have a recessive mode of inheritance, and so only a portion of the litter is affected (see Table 15 -2). Lysosomal storage diseases will have signs in other organs including the retina. Skeletal and facial malformations are prominent in the mucopolysaccharidoses. In general, lysosomal storage disorders tend to be slowly progressive and lead to the animal's death. 4 Enzyme replacement, small molecule, gene, and cell-based therapies may have value in some conditions and have only been used experimentally in affected animals. 3, 6 Genetic testing may be available for some of these disorders.

Clinical signs relate to the predominant region of the nervous system affected. The motor neuron degenerations are rare and usually occur in young growing animals with an insidious and progressive clinical disease course of neuromuscular weakness and generalized LMN signs (see Chapter 7) . Myelin disorders cause ataxia and tremor that progresses to paresis. Diffuse myelinopathies occur with inherited, metabolic, and toxic disorders. Primary cerebellar cortical degeneration refers to degeneration and loss of Purkinje cells and/or granule cells. Pathologic processes of cerebellar degeneration are classified microscopically as atrophy, abiotrophy, and transsynaptic neuronal degeneration. Atrophy, a term that lacks specificity, refers to loss of cerebellar mass often as a result of a degenerative process ( Figure  15 -4). 2, 8 Cerebellar degenerative disorders cause clinical signs of cerebellar ataxia and intention tremor (see Chapter 8) .

Young Cairn terriers show a progressive GP ataxia, tetraparesis, and cerebellar signs. 10 Histopathology reveals neuron degeneration in the spinal cord, brainstem, and thalamus, and degenerative changes in the tracts of the spinal cord and brainstem. A multisystem degeneration recognized in young cocker spaniels manifests cerebellovestibular and forebrain signs. 11 Histopathology shows widespread neuronal degeneration in the cerebellum and brain with presence of swollen axons. Recently, a multisystem degeneration has been described in golden retrievers that show tremor, progressive tetraparesis, and generalized LMN signs. 12 The spinal cord had changes consistent with axonopathy; there was loss of cranial nerve motor nuclei; and nerves had evidence of Wallerian degeneration.",

These disorders have been recognized in Kerry blue terriers and Chinese crested dogs. 13, 14 In these breeds, cerebellar ataxia begins between 3 and 6 months of age. As the basal nuclei degenerate, affected dogs have increasing difficulty initiating movements and maintaining balance. These disorders are autosomal recessive and have been linked to a locus on chromosome 1. 14 Dysautonomia. In veterinary medicine, the term dysauto nomia refers to acute or subacute idiopathic panautonomic failure involving both the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems. Dysautonomia is also described in Chapters 3, 9, and 11. It is a progressive degenerative disease of the ganglia of the autonomic nervous system. The general somatic efferent system is not affected except for involvement of the anal sphincter. Dysautonomia was first recognized in horses in Scotland (grass sickness) and then described in cats in the United Kingdom and Europe in the early 1980s. 15, 16 Dysautonomia was first described in dogs from southwest Missouri and Wyoming in 1988 and continues to be reported in Missouri and surrounding states. [17] [18] [19] The etiology is still unknown but a toxico-infectious etiology resulting from Clostridium botuli num type CD has been proposed in horses. Acute or subacute autonomic neuropathy of people is similar to the animal forms and studies suggest an immune-mediated basis for this disease.",

Many affected dogs are from rural environments but the disease has been documented in dogs maintained strictly in kennel environments. The peak incidence in Missouri is from late winter to early spring. The following clinical signs develop and are progressive over 2 to 3 weeks. All signs may not be present in all dogs. \u2022 Dysuria, distended urinary bladder: The pelvic nerve is a parasympathetic nerve that innervates the detrusor muscle. Detrusor muscle dysfunction is a common finding. \u2022 Mydriasis and absent pupillary light reflexes: Pupillary constriction is a function of the parasympathetic fibers contained in the oculomotor nerves. \u2022 Elevated third eyelid: This sign is present in about 50% of cases, suggesting some dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system. \u2022 Dry mucous membranes, decreased tear production: Dry mouth, nose, and eyes are common findings. Secretions are largely the function of the parasympathetic nervous system. \u2022 Vomiting, regurgitation: Megaesophagus is a common finding. The vagus nerve (parasympathetic) innervates the esophagus and stomach and plays a major role in esophageal and gastric motility. \u2022 Decreased anal (perineal) reflex: The external anal sphincter is innervated by the pudendal nerve, a general somatic efferent nerve. This is the only sign of somatic dysfunction. \u2022 Intestinal ileus: Distention of the intestinal tract is a less common finding. Constipation and diarrhea may be seen in some dogs. \u2022 Weight loss, muscle wasting, and decreased appetite \u2022 Gait, postural reactions, and spinal reflexes are not affected Dysautonomia also has been reported in cats but no clear risk factors have been identified. 21 Cats have clinical signs similar to dogs. Dysautonomia should be suspected from the cluster of clinical signs. Although myasthenia gravis and botulism cause some of these signs, the presence of weakness in the skeletal muscles is not observed in dysautonomia. One of the best clinical procedures for confirming dysautonomia is to demonstrate denervation hypersensitivity to the pupils. Pilocarpine ophthalmic solution (1%) is diluted to a concentration of 0.05% with normal saline. One to two drops are placed in one eye and the pupils are observed every 15 minutes. Dogs with dysautonomia have rapid pupillary constriction compared with normal dogs who either do not respond at all or show delayed responses. If no response is seen in 90 minutes, the test is repeated with 1% pilocarpine. Unless parasympatholytic drugs (atropine) or toxins are present, rapid pupillary constriction should occur. Lack of innervation causes an upregulation of the postsynaptic receptors with denervation supersensitivity in neurotransmission.",

Pyrrolizidine alkaloids in certain plants such as Senecio spp. and Crotalaria spp. cause parenchymal liver damage and hepatic encephalopathy in herbivores. Parenchymal disease severely reduces the capacity of the liver to perform its normal metabolic functions. Portosystemic venous shunts divert a significant portion of the portal blood past the liver into the vena cava. Potentially toxic substances that normally are absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and detoxified in the liver enter the systemic circulation. Similar to portosystemic venous shunting, the pathophysiology in microvascular dysplasia involves shunting of portal blood into the systemic circulation but occurs within the liver vasculature on a microscopic level.

Most animals with liver disease severe enough to produce HE have other clinical signs indicative of hepatic failure, such as vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, retarded growth, ascites, polyuria-polydipsia, and sometimes icterus. The neurologic signs are frequently worse after feeding, especially if high-protein food is given. The release of nitrogenous materials into the portal circulation exacerbates the signs. Obtundation that may progress to stupor and coma is the most common neurologic sign. Other signs of forebrain involvement such as behavior change, continuous pacing and head pressing, blindness, and seizures also are common. Frequently, the clinical picture is that of a waxing and waning diffuse encephalopathy. The postural reactions and reflexes are only minimally involved except when the animal is nearly comatose.

Hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, constipation, or increased fatty acids also may precipitate a crisis. Alterations in fluids, electrolytes, or pH may increase the blood and tissue ammonia levels. Decreased renal function reduces elimination of ammonia and other metabolites. Fever and infection cause increased tissue catabolism and increased nitrogen release. Stored blood for transfusions may have an excess of ammonia. Depressant drugs directly affect the brain and frequently are metabolized in the liver. The first evidence of hepatic dysfunction often is slow recovery from anesthesia. Diuretics used to treat ascites may cause HE through their effect on potassium, renal output of ammonia, and alkalosis. A range of clinicopathologic abnormalities may be present, depending on the cause. Microcytosis with normochromic erythrocytes, ammonium biurate crystals in the urine, and lowered cholesterol, blood glucose, and vitamin K dependent clotting factor levels may be seen with liver failure. Frequently, serum albumin and serum urea nitrogen levels are low. Parenchymal disease often causes elevations in liver enzymes, such as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). These enzymes usually are not elevated significantly in portacaval shunts. 25 Hepatic dysfunction may be confirmed with tests such as the ammonia tolerance test or preprandial and postprandial serum bile acids measured after a 12-hour fast. 26, 27 Hepatic ultrasonography (US) is a sensitive indicator of liver size, but the definitive diagnosis of anomalous portal vein circulation requires US, contrast-enhanced radiography or computed tomography (CT), or nuclear medicine. Depending on the experience of the operator, abdominal US has a sensitivity of about 80% and a specificity of about 65% for the detection of extrahepatic portosystemic shunts (PSS). The sensitivity for detection of intrahepatic shunts is nearly 100%. 28 Radiocolloid scintigraphy using technetium-99m sulfur colloid (TcSC) is used to evaluate liver size and shape. Transcolonic TcSC procedures have been described for the diagnosis of macrovascular shunts in dogs, cats, and potbellied pigs. 29, 30 Biopsy is required for confirmation of parenchymal disease.",

If dietary management alone is inadequate, then oral, nonabsorbable antibiotics (such as neomycin) may be given to reduce the bacterial flora that split urea. Mild laxatives or lactulose (a nonabsorbable disaccharide) may be helpful. 31, 32 In addition to its laxative effects, lactulose creates an acid environment in the colon that allows NH 3 to be trapped as NH 4 + in the gut lumen.",

Conditions that have been recognized include bovine ketosis (acetonemia) and pregnancy toxemia of cattle, sheep, and goats. Unlike most monogastric animals, ruminants produce most of their glucose supplies from the gluconeogenesis of volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic, and butyric acids). Nearly 50% of the glucose in a cow is normally derived from dietary propionic acid that is converted to glucose in the gluconeogenic pathway. Reduction of propionic acid production in the rumen can result in hypoglycemia and the subsequent mobilization of free fatty acids and glycerol from fat stores. The liver has a limited ability to use these fatty acids because the levels of oxaloacetate are low. Acetyl coenzyme A therefore is not incorporated into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is converted into the ketone bodies acetoacetate and \u00df-hydroxybutyrate. When the production of ketones by the liver exceeds peripheral use, pathologic ketosis results.",

Hypocalcemic syndromes are well documented in dogs and cats (also see Chapter 10). 43 In both species, primary hypoparathyroidism is a documented cause of chronic hypocalcemia. In cats, hypoparathyroidism is sometimes caused by inadvertent surgical resection of the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Hypocalcemia may be associated with chronic renal disease in dogs and cats. It is the major biochemical abnormality in dogs with eclampsia and may be observed in animals receiving blood transfusions containing calciumchelating anticoagulants. Enema solutions that contain phosphate may cause hypocalcemia in cats. Ionized hypocalcemia occurs in critically ill dogs; especially dogs with sepsis. 44 When the total serum calcium concentration falls below 6 to 7 mg/dL (ionized <0.6 to 0.7 mmol/L), the clinical signs of hypocalcemia are likely to occur. 45 Hypocalcemia increases membrane hyperexcitability by decreasing the membrane threshold to more easily elicit an action potential. Tetanic muscle contractions are the most common clinical signs, but some dogs develop muscle weakness early in the disease. Hypocalcemia should be investigated when the total serum calcium concentration is less than 7.0 mg/dL and the serum albumin concentration is normal. Serum ionized calcium concentrations help to confirm the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of hypocalcemia is confirmed, the underlying cause should be identified. The diagnosis of both eclampsia and iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism is usually obvious from the history and physical findings. Primary hypoparathyroidism may be confirmed through parathormone (PTH) assays conducted at specialized laboratories.",

Calcitriol is a vitamin D analog that is used to treat subacute and chronic hypocalcemia in dogs. The initial dose is 10 to 15 ng/kg twice a day for 3 to 4 days. Then the dose is reduced to 2.5 to 7.5 ng/mg twice a day. Animals should be closely monitored because hypercalcemia may be a complication of vitamin D therapy, especially when supplemental calcium salts are administered. 46 ",

An early sign of diabetes mellitus may be exercise intolerance and weakness. As insulin deficiency progresses, ketonemia develops from a marked increase in lipolysis and serum fatty acids. The ensuing metabolic acidosis results in depressed cerebral function that culminates in coma and death. In the untreated ketoacidotic dog or cat, hyperkalemia can cause flaccid muscles by depressing neuromuscular and cardiovascular functions. With therapy and correction of the acidosis, potassium ions reenter cells, and hypokalemia may be a complication that fosters muscle weakness and depression. In some animals, the hyperglycemia may be severe, even though acidosis is absent. This syndrome is called hyperosmolar nonketotic coma. Clinical signs result from the hyperosmolar effects of glucose on the cerebral cortex. Diabetic animals, especially cats, may also develop neuropathy with associated LMN signs (see Chapter 7) .",

The clinical signs are caused by the metabolic effects of hypercortisolemia. Generalized muscle weakness resulting from the catabolic effects of glucocorticoids is a common finding.

Pituitary tumors causing hyperadrenocorticisms may be present without causing neurologic signs. 57 In dogs and cats, hyperadrenocorticism is confirmed with screening tests such as the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, the ACTH stimulation test, or the urine cortisol:creatinine ratio. Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism is differentiated from functional adrenocortical tumors with the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test or ACTH assay or both. Similar tests and measurement of increased plasma ACTH concentrations are useful in the diagnosis of equine Cushing disease. 58 Abdominal US may also be helpful in the diagnosis of adrenal gland disease. Macroadenomas can be accurately diagnosed with MRI or CT. 59 In dogs, pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism is usually treated medically with mitotane or trilostane. 60 Mitotane causes necrosis of the adrenal cortex, primarily the zona fasciculata and reticularis, and results in markedly decreased cortisol production. If the dosage is carefully monitored, aldosterone secretion is much less affected. Side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, and depression. Trilostane reduces synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenal androgens. It also can be used in dogs, cats, and horses for pituitary and adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. It is well tolerated and has fewer side effects than mitotane. However, it may not produce long-term control of clinical signs. Readers are encouraged to consult internal medicine textbooks or veterinary drug handbooks for dosages and correct regimens for each drug. In dogs and cats with pituitary macrotumors, treatment also is directed at control of the pituitary mass (see Chapter 12) . Adrenalectomy is recommended for adrenocortical neoplasia.",

Hypokalemic myopathy is well documented in cats with renal failure, in cats with chronic anorexia, and in cats receiving low-potassium diets.

The blood glucose concentration is of prime importance for normal neuronal metabolism because glucose oxidation is the primary energy source. No glycogen stores are present in the CNS. Glucose enters nervous tissue by noninsulin dependent transport mechanisms. Hypoglycemia at glucose concentrations less than 40 mg/dL can precipitate signs of hypoglycemia. Neurologic signs of hypoglycemia are manifested by dullness, hypothermia, weakness, seizures, and coma. Factors responsible for clinical signs include rate of decrease, level, and duration of hypoglycemia. The severity of the CNS signs may be related more to the rate of decrease than to the actual concentration of glucose. Sudden drops in glucose levels are more likely to cause seizures, whereas slowly developing hypoglycemia may cause weakness, paresis, behavioral changes, or stupor.",

Studies in puppies have shown that during hypoglycemia, lactic acid is not only incorporated into the perinatal brain but also consumed to the extent that the metabolite can support up to 60% total cerebral energy required for metabolic processes. 69 Although the neonatal brain can readily metabolize ketone bodies, lack of body fat and prolonged time necessary to produce ketones prevent this mechanism from protecting neonates from acute hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in young animals may be secondary to malnutrition, parasitism, stress, or some GI abnormality. Puppies are frequently extremely depressed or comatose. Serum glucose should be determined, and IV glucose is administered immediately (2 to 4 mL of 20% glucose per kilogram of body weight). Diazepam often will have no effect on halting hypoglycemic seizures. Continued signs of stupor or coma indicate brain swelling and are treated with hypertonic solutions (see Chapter 12) . Dietary regulation, including tube feeding if necessary, must be established to maintain normoglycemia.",

In particular neurotoxic agents that stimulate the CNS will manifest signs of hyperactivity, hyperesthesia, muscle tremor and fasciculation, and behavior changes. Toxicants affecting the autonomic nervous system induce clinical signs by interference with cholinergic neurotransmission. Stimulation of the cholinergic neurotransmission will result in bronchoconstriction, muscle tremors, exocrine gland stimulation, bradycardia, and other CNS effects. Toxins may exert effects at the neuromuscular junction through increased release of acetylcholine and increased receptor stimulation and subsequent muscular fatigue. Blockade of cholinergic neurotransmission depends upon the type of cholinergic receptor involved. Muscarinic receptor blockade causes CNS depression. Nicotinic receptor blockade results in skeletal muscle paralysis and often tremor. Toxins such as bromethalin and hexachlorophene affect myelin causing intramyelinic edema and alter conduction of the action potential. When an animal shows signs suggestive of poisoning, the owner must be questioned carefully to find a possible source. Animals in status epilepticus must be treated immediately, and the history must be obtained later (see Chapter 13) . Direct questions regarding agents that are capable of producing the signs must be asked.

Animals in status epilepticus must be treated immediately (see Chapter 13) . Tetany. The tetany produced by strychnine is differentiated from the seizures produced by other agents in this group. Tetany is a period of sustained muscular contraction with intermittent periods of relaxation. Despite the severe muscle contractions, the animal is conscious. Tetany caused by strychnine may be confused with hypocalcemic tetany seen in lactating animals of all species or in tetanus. Intravenous calcium provides immediate relief in cases of hypocalcemia. The term tetanus is associated with the toxic effects of Clostridium tetani.

[100] [101] [102] The drug is also used in the chronic treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Neurologic signs include seizures, tremors, ataxia, blindness, hyperactivity, and vestibular dysfunction. Doses of metronidazole reported to be toxic in cats ranged from 111 mg/kg of body weight per day for 9 weeks to 58 mg/kg of body weight per day for 6 months. 101 The neurologic signs resolved within days of drug withdrawal and supportive treatment. In dogs, doses as low as 67.3 mg/kg of body weight per day for 3 to 14 days caused neurotoxicity. 100 In a report of five dogs, two were euthanized because of severe CNS disease, and three recovered after several months. 100 Most dogs recover within 7 to 14 days. Diazepam may be effective in treatment of the neurologic signs because it facilitates the effects of GABA, a potent inhibitory neurotransmitter. 102 Diazepam, 0.43 mg/kg PO every 8 hours for 3 days, decreased response time from 4.25 days for untreated dogs to 13.4 hours for treated dogs. In addition, the time to recovery was reduced from 11 days to 38.8 hours. 102 Ivermectin. Ivermectin is widely used as an antiparasitic agent and heartworm preventative. It is also used in higher doses for the treatment of sarcoptic and demodectic mange in dogs. In most breeds of dogs, ivermectin has a wide margin of safety. Collies, Australian shepherds, Shetland sheepdogs, and Old English sheepdogs have an increased sensitivity to ivermectin and related compounds. These breeds have a genetic mutation that results in a nonfunctional P-glycoprotein. 103,104 P-glycoprotein plays an important neuroprotective role in the blood-brain barrier in that it enhances the transport of drugs from the CSF back into circulation. Ivermectin is a GABA agonist that inhibits activity at presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the CNS. Clinical signs of ivermectin neurotoxicity include depression, disorientation, tremors, ataxia, blindness, mydriasis, retinopathy, seizures, and coma. [104] [105] [106] [107] Clinical signs are dose dependent in that susceptible breeds rarely develop clinical signs at 6 \u03bcg/kg once a month, which is the standard dose for heartworm prevention. Doses exceeding 200 \u03bcg/kg may cause clinical signs in susceptible breeds and doses above 400 \u03bcg/kg may cause death. 105 The recovery period may take more than 3 weeks. There is no specific anecdote for ivermectin toxicity. Three adult horses developed neurologic signs 18 hours after oral administration of ivermectin paste. 108 Signs included depression, ataxia, drooping Chronic exposure, rare in animals (see Table 15 -5)",

Leukoencephalomalacia is caused by the mycotoxin fumonisin B1 found in contaminated corn. The toxin creates a severe liquefactive necrosis and degeneration of the cerebrum, brainstem, and spinal cord. The disease has a worldwide distribution and typically occurs in the late fall through early spring. Neurologic (most common) and hepatoxic syndromes are recognized. Clinical signs develop 3 to 4 weeks after daily ingestion of contaminated corn. The onset of clinical signs is rapid with death occurring in 2 to 3 days. The CNS signs are similar to other equine encephalopathies. The hepatotoxic syndrome is associated with swelling of the lips and nose, somnolence, severe icterus, petechia of mucous membranes, abnormal breathing, and cyanosis. Diagnosis is based on histopathology. Analysis for the toxin in feed is recommended. There is no treatment and mortality is high.",

            "text": "Most of the inflammatory diseases are characterized by an acute onset. All are progressive, and some are chronic-progressive. Diffuse or multifocal involvement is characteristic of most of the diseases in this group, but localized signs also occur. The minimum database (see Chapters 1 and 4) may provide evidence of systemic infection (e.g., alterations in white blood cell [WBC] count), although many primary CNS inflammatory diseases do not produce a systemic response. Therefore, positive findings in laboratory data are useful, but negative findings do not rule out infectious disease. Focal deficits should be investigated according to the location of the lesion (see Chapters 5 through 15). Analysis of CSF is a useful test for establishing the diagnosis of inflammatory disease (see Chapter 4) . Increases in CSF protein concentrations range from low (50 to 100 mg/dL) in chronic viral diseases to very high (>300 mg/dL) in bacterial and fungal infections. Characteristic cell changes are increased mononuclear cells in viral diseases; increased neutrophils in bacterial diseases; increased numbers of both mononuclear cells and neutrophils in mycotic and protozoal diseases and feline infectious peritonitis; and increased numbers of mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and some eosinophils in parasitic, fungal, and immune-mediated diseases. Exceptions are com mon. For example, chronic bacterial infections may cause a None mononuclear cell response, especially increases in macrophages, whereas some viral diseases cause increased neutrophils in the CSF. The presence of a few neutrophils in the CSF is not necessarily abnormal. The only cell whose presence in the CSF seems consistently abnormal is the macrophage. The CSF can be normal in CNS inflammation. Clinical suspicion of an infection is an adequate indication for bacterial and fungal cultures and bacterial sensitivity tests. The presence of antibodies in the CSF to specific viruses or to other infectious agents provides evidence of infection because they are not present in normal, vaccinated animals or those with systemic infection but without CNS disease (also see Chapter 4). 92 In CSF samples contaminated by blood (hemorrhage), serum albumin and antibody concentrations should be compared with concentrations in the CSF. When the level of CSF antibodies exceeds that of serum, CNS infection is more likely. Inflammation may increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, allowing serum antibodies to leak into the CSF.",

The pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and implications of treatment of bacterial meningitis in humans and experimental animals have been reviewed. 100 Bacteria must be able to survive in the intravascular space, penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and colonize in the meninges or CSF. Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier causes exudation of albumin into the CSF and facilitates the development of brain or spinal cord edema. Experiments in rats suggest that bacteria in the CSF elicit the release of endogenous inflammatory mediators that are important in the development and progression of clinical signs. 125 Experimental studies in rabbits reveal that the inflammatory process causes brain edema, probably secondary to loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation, direct cytotoxicity, and increased CSF outflow resistance. 101 These findings may have important therapeutic implications. Rapidly acting bactericidal therapy delivered into the CSF is mandatory because only bactericidal therapy is associated with a cure in humans and experimental animal models. Rapid destruction of bacteria could release high concentrations of inflammatory bacterial toxins (lipopolysaccharides), which might exacerbate the inflammatory process. [126] [127] [128] These studies also suggest that adjunctive therapy with antiinflammatory agents may be beneficial in bacterial meningitis. 101 In animals with experimental Streptococcus pneu moniae meningitis, methylprednisolone reduced CSF outflow resistance and both methylprednisolone and dexamethasone reduced brain edema. 101 Pretreatment with dexamethasone followed in 15 to 20 minutes with third-generation cephalosporins resulted in decreased inflammatory mediator release in laboratory animals with Haemophilus influenzae CNS infections. 127 Several controlled studies in children with bacterial meningitis demonstrated the benefits of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, especially when corticosteroids were administered 15 to 20 minutes before bactericidal antibiotic therapy. 128 In these studies, dexamethasone was given 15 to 20 minutes before cefotaxime therapy and was continued every 6 hours for 4 days.",

Listeria monocytogenes is a resistant and ubiquitous bacterium that causes CNS disease in people and domestic animals (listeriosis, circling disease, silage disease). 147 Ruminants appear more susceptible to infection than do other domestic animals. The organism can be transmitted in silage and other feed. Food-borne infection is common in humans. Outbreaks usually occur in the winter. In cattle and sheep, the organism penetrates the oral mucosa via wounds and is transmitted to the brain in a retrograde fashion via the trigeminal nerve. Signs related to infection of the rostral medulla (trigeminal, facial, and vestibulocochlear nerve dysfunction) are common. Although meningitis and encephalitis are the classic manifestations of listeriosis in ruminants, spinal cord disease, abortion, and mastitis also occur. Clinical signs of encephalitis are often more severe in small ruminants. The most useful antemortem diagnostic test is CSF analysis. Characteristic findings include increased protein concentration and nucleated cell count with mononuclear cells predominating. Definitive diagnosis is made by histopathology. Gross necropsy findings are not very remarkable. Histopathology reveals multifocal areas of necrosis with infiltrations of macrophages and neutrophils. Diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of the organism from body fluids or tissues. Warm or cold enrichment methods are used to isolate the organism but immunohistochemistry is more successful than bacteriologic culture for detecting L. monocytogenes in brain tissue. Treatment is initiated early and involves long-term parenteral antibiotic therapy (penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, or oxytetracycline). Prevention is aimed a limiting fecal contamination of the feed from ruminants and wildlife. Bacterial Brain Abscess. Brain abscesses are more common in large animals than in dogs and cats. Neurologic signs relate to the specific location of the abscess and compression or necrosis of surrounding neurologic structures. Large abscesses may create signs similar to any other intracranial mass. Increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and brain herniation may occur (Figure 15-10) .",

The diagnosis of clinically active toxoplasma infection is based on suggestive clinical signs, demonstration of T. gondii tachyzoites or bradyzoites in tissue biopsy sections, or immune testing for antibodies or antigen in serum, ocular fluid, or CSF. Although several immunologic tests are commercially available, the T. gondii-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are most often used in dogs and cats. IgM levels tend to increase within 2 to 4 weeks of infection but are negative by 16 weeks. 168 IgM titers more than 1:256 indicate recent or active infection. A fourfold increase in IgG titers also indicates recent or active disease. Both IgG and IgM titers can be assessed in samples of CSF and compared with serum concentrations of albumin, IgG, and IgM. When the levels in CSF exceed those in serum, active or recent CNS infection should be suspected.",

The opossum is the definitive host for S. neurona and harbors the sexual stages of the protozoa within its gastrointestinal tract. Natural intermediate hosts for S. neurona that have been identified include the skunk, raccoon, cat, Pacific harbor seal, and nine-banded armadillo. The horse is an aberrant dead-end host. Horses are most likely infected by fecaloral transmission. The diagnosis and treatment of EPM are discussed in Chapter 6.",

Descriptions have been mainly reported in humans, horses, and in a number of other mammalians, including dogs, cats, cattle, camelids, rodents, and pigs. [176] [177] [178] The causative agents are single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses, Alphavirus genus of the family Togaviridae. Birds are involved in application of the disease. Susceptible horses, usually younger, show clinical signs 2 to 3 weeks after viral infection of birds. Times for peak infection are June to August in the southern states and September in the northern states. The clinical signs include mild to severe pyrexia, anorexia, stiffness, propulsive walking, depression, hyperesthesia, aggression, and excitability. 179 Obtundation is the most common clinical sign and seizures occur in one third of the cases. Neurologic signs are variable and occur as diffuse or multifocal forebrain disease with brainstem and spinal cord involvement. The signs are peracute to acute in onset and progressive. Mortality rates are highest with EEE. Histopathology reveals gray matter predominance with multifocal to diffuse meningoencephalomyelitis. Diagnosis is made via serology (CF, HI, SN, and IgM capture ELISA). Results of CSF analysis are distinctive and reveal very high protein concentrations and severe neutrophilic pleocytosis. Treatment is mostly supportive care, which includes corticosteroids or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and physical therapy. Long-term antiinflammatory therapy may be important for neurologic recovery. Efficacious vaccines are available but twice yearly vaccination is recommended. Mosquito control is important in reducing risk of infection. Antiviral Therapy. Few reports address the use of antiviral agents in animals. Acyclovir is an antiherpes viral agent that inhibits the enzyme thymidine kinase and thus inhibits deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. This effect is 200 times greater for the viral enzyme than for the enzyme in mammalian cells. 180 Acyclovir can be given orally and intravenously. It penetrates into the CSF and aqueous humor at 30% to 50% of the plasma concentration. In human herpes encephalitis, the IV dose is 10 mg/kg every 8 hours. The dose should be reduced with renal failure because the drug is excreted in the urine. Encephalopathy is a rare side effect with high doses.",

Clinically, GME has been characterized into three clinical presentations: focal, disseminated, or ocular. 199, 200 Cervical pain is a common finding. About 50% of affected dogs have focal signs referable to the forebrain, and about 50% have forebrain and brainstem disease. 196 Central vestibular signs are common manifestations of acute disease. 197 Rarely, involvement of the peripheral nervous system may be observed. 201 A definitive diagnosis is based on histopathologic examination of the CNS. Microscopically, the hallmark of GME is perivascular cuffs of granulomatous inflammation ( Figure  15-19) . 202 Presumptive antemortem diagnosis is based on a combination of signalment, anamnesis, clinicopathologic data, and exclusion of other disease capable of producing similar clinical signs. Since the definitive diagnosis of GME necessitates histologic evaluation of CNS tissue, the term meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown etiology (MUE) has been used to describe dogs without a definitive diagnosis.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of MUE should be pursued in a logical manner (see Chapter 4) . Briefly, minimum database (complete blood count, chemistry profile, and urinalysis) often discloses nonspecific abnormalities. Analysis of CSF is critical to establishing a presumptive antemortem diagnosis. Mononuclear pleocytosis, activated macrophages, occasionally neutrophils, and rarely mast cells with increases in protein content are common CSF abnormalities. Cross-sectional imaging also is important in the diagnostic workup. MRI of the brain is the imaging modality of choice. With MRI, multifocal hyperintensities on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences predominantly affecting the white matter are observed. Enhancement patterns vary on T1-weighted sequences after administration of contrast media. A focal space occupying mass or abnormalities involving the optic nerves may be observed in animals with the focal or ocular forms, respectively. 203 Abnormal findings from CSF analysis and MRI of the brain can be found in other forms of MUE. Therefore, the value in pursuing these diagnostics tests is not only in documenting abnormalities but in excluding other disease processes; the greatest importance of which is eliminating infectious disease from consideration. Given the treatment of GME is centered on immunosuppression, misdiagnosis may be devastating in animals with infectious disease. Therefore, depending on the clinician's index of suspicion, further diagnostic testing aimed at the identification of an infectious etiology may be warranted. Likewise, CNS lymphoma may occur with clinical signs of multifocal signs and have MRI findings and lymphocytic pleocytosis that are difficult to differentiate from GME. PCR for the antigen receptor rearrangements may be useful in the diagnosis of CNS lymphoma.",

Some dogs respond to prednisone (2 to 4 mg/kg every 24 hours, using the aforementioned reducing-dosage regimen), but relapses and progression of neurologic signs are common in many dogs. Cytosine arabinoside, given as a single agent or in combination with prednisone, is a more effective treatment. 204, 205 In one study of 10 dogs treated with cytosine arabinoside and prednisone, all dogs achieved partial or complete remission and the median survival time was 531 days; five dogs were still alive at the end of the study. 206 Cytosine arabinoside is administered in cycles. Each cycle consists of administering the drug at a dose of 50 mg/m 2 given subcutaneously twice a day for 2 consecutive days. Cycles are initially repeated every 3 weeks. With time, gradual lengthening of the interval between cycles can be done. In severely affected animals, initial administration of 600 mg/m 2 given as a constant rate infusion over 2 days may be beneficial. 207 To monitor for myelosuppression, a CBC should be performed 10 to 14 days following the first course of treatment and every 2 to 3 months throughout the course of therapy. Cyclosporine may also be effective in treating GME. Two protocols have been reported. 205, 208 In one, cyclosporine was administered at 10 mg/kg every 24 hours for 6 weeks. The dose was then reduced to 5 mg/kg per day. Prednisone was also administered at 2 to 4 mg/kg daily for 3 to 4 weeks. In another protocol, cyclosporine was administered at 3 to 10 mg/kg every 12 hours. Serum cyclosporine levels were followed but the drug was not detected in the CSF, even in dogs with good clinical response. In one study of 10 dogs treated with cyclosporine and prednisone, all dogs responded and the median survival time was 930 days. 208 Procarbazine has also been used as an adjunctive therapy combined with prednisone. 209 The dosage administered was 25 to 50 mg/m 2 orally once daily. The combination of procarbazine and prednisone in 21 dogs provided a median survival time of 14 months. Seven dogs experienced myelosuppression and three dogs had hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Other immunosuppressive drugs used in the treatment of GME include mycophenolate mofetil (20 mg/kg orally twice daily) and leflunomide (1.5 to 4.0 mg/kg orally once daily). 210 Radiation treatment is effective for dogs with focal GME. 173 The prognosis for survival is better for dogs with focal disease. 196 ",
