The majority of COVID-19 patients had pneumonia and showed symptoms include fever and cough [2, 3] . The genome sequence of causative novel coronavirus was shared through Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform from 12 January 2020. The sequences of novel coronavirus (CoV) showed close similarity to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) and the virus uses ACE2 as the entry receptor like SARS-CoV [4] [5] [6] . The Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses designated the virus as SARS-CoV-2 [7] .",

Clinical diagnosis methods including CT scan are also utilized to identify COVID-19 cases in Hubei province, China, from 13 February 2020 [11] . Although qRT-PCR assay served as a gold-standard method to detect respiratory infectious viruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [12] [13] [14] [15] , current qRT-PCR assays targetting SARS-CoV-2 have some caveats. First, due to the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV, primer-probe sets would cross-react. Second, the sensitivity of the assays may not enough to confirm suspicious patients in early time points after admission. Indeed, cases of positive CT scan results and negative RT-PCR results at initial presentation were reported [16] . The performance of molecular diagnosis might be dependent on primers, probes, and reagents. There have been no comparative results of the current qRT-PCR analysis for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.",

The assay with HKU-ORF1b-nsp14 (Hong Kong), and ORF1ab (China) sets showed positive signals in the concentration of 1.5 copies/reaction (data not shown). The R 2 value from RdRp_SARSr (Germany), HKU-ORF1b-nsp14 (Hong Kong), and ORF1ab (China) were 0.983, 0.997 and 0.997, respectively. The calculated amplification efficiency of RdRp_SARSr (Germany), HKU-ORF1b-nsp14 (Hong Kong), and ORF1ab (China) was 101.6%, 96.1%, and 109.8%, respectively. As a result, ORF1ab (China) set may be recommended for the laboratory confirmation of the RdRp/Orf1 gene. N Assays The Ct value of N (China), HKU-N (Hong Kong), NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan), WH-NIC N (Thailand), 2019-nCoV_N1, N2, and N3 (USA) from low concentration (15 copies/reaction) were 34.86, 35.43, 33.13, 38.13, 34.71, 33.14, and 33.09, respectively (Table 2). The Ct value of 2019-nCoV_N2, N3 (USA), and NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan) sets were similar to each other, and the sets could be regarded as the most sensitive sets. The moderately sensitive assay was based on 2019-nCoV_N1 (USA) and N (China). These sets had higher Ct value than the most , however, the Ct values from low concentration (15 copies/\u03bcl) were still within the cut-off value (Ct <37). WH-NIC N (Thailand) set was less sensitive than other sets. The Ct value from low concentration (15 copies/\u03bcl) was close to the cut-off value (Ct <38). The R 2 value from of N (China), HKU-N (Hong Kong), NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan), WH-NIC N (Thailand), 2019-nCoV_N1, N2, and N3 (USA) were 0.989, 0.980, 0.987, 0.987, 0.986, 0.952, and 0.991, respectively. The calculated amplification efficiency of N (China), HKU-N (Hong Kong), NIID_2019-nCOV_N (Japan), WH-NIC N (Thailand), 2019-nCoV_N1, N2, and N3 (USA) were 89.4, 105.3, 100.7, 106.2, 95.2, 97.3, and 93.9, respectively.
