The disease caused by MERS-CoV in children presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, and it is associated with a lower mortality rate compared with adults. Poor outcome is observed mainly in admitted patients with medical comorbidities. We report a new case of MERS-CoV infection in a 9-month-old child complicated by severe respiratory symptoms, multi-organ dysfunction, and death. We reviewed the literature in an attempt to characterize the mode of presentation, the risk factors, and outcome of MERS-CoV infection in the pediatric population.",

A 9-month-old child recently diagnosed to have infantile nephrotic syndrome and started on oral prednisolone was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after 5 days of ward admission due to Streptococcus pneumonia sepsis. He was started on vancomycin and meropenem, and required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. Blood gas showed metabolic acidosis, and the chest x-ray was normal. He gradually improved. On day 4 of PICU admission, he was completely weaned from inotropes, and repeated blood culture was negative. He remained on low-ventilatory support because of ascites and chest wall edema. On day 8, his condition deteriorated. He had increased respiratory effort and increased oxygen requirement. Blood gases showed compensated respiratory acidosis. Chest x-ray showed diffuse bilateral haziness (Figure 1 ). At the same time, a decrease in urine output, and worsening in renal function was noted.",

Furthermore, out of 701 patients confirmed MERS-CoV reported, so far worldwide, only 14 were pediatric cases (2%). 4 Does this mean that MERS-CoV is mainly an adult disease? Or alternatively, does MERS-CoV in children have a different clinical picture, including a less severe disease, or an atypical presentation, or even an asymptomatic carrier state? What are the risk factors, the comorbidities and the outcome? These questions are still unanswered in the pediatric literature. The 14 children with confirmed MERS-CoV have a mean age of 99 months, and they were 8 females and 6 males ( Table 1) . Nine patients were asymptomatic and were detected during screening of family contact; all these 9 patients were healthy without underlying diseases. 5 Three patients developed mild respiratory symptoms, 5-7 while the last 2 patients developed severe respiratory symptoms. 5 These 2 patients have associated comorbidities. The outcome was good in 12 patients, while the 2 patients with severe respiratory symptoms and comorbidities developed multi-organs dysfunction and died (14.2%).",

This impression of low mortality in children with MERS-CoV was also reported during the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections in children, where symptoms were milder, and resulted in no mortality, and few hospitalizations. 9 The low incidence of MERS-CoV infection in children is corroborated by a Jordanian prospective year-round viral surveillance study in children less than 2 years of age admitted with acute respiratory symptoms and/ or fever from March to September 2010 tested for MERS-CoV, all 474 tested patients were negative. 10 We were, unfortunately, unable to identify how our patient got infected.",
