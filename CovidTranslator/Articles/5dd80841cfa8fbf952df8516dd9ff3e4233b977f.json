            "text": "The lamin B receptor (LBR) is a polytopic integral membrane protein localized exclusively in the inner nuclear membrane domain of the nuclear envelope. Its cDNA deduced primary structure consists of a highly charged amino-terminal domain of 205 residues that faces the nucleoplasm followed by a hydrophobic domain with eight potential transmembrane segments. To identify determinants that sort LBR from its site of integration (RER and outer nuclear membrane) to the inner nuclear membrane, we prepared full-length, truncated, and chimeric cDNA constructs of chick LBR, transfected these into mammalian cells and detected the expressed protein by immunofluorescence microscopy using appropriate antibodies. Surprisingly, we found that the determinants for sorting of LBR to the inner nuclear membrane reside in a region comprising its first transmembrane sequence plus flanking residues on either side. The other transmembrane regions as well as the nucleoplasmic domain are not required for sorting. We propose that the first transmembrane segment of LBR interacts specifically with another transmembrane segment and consider several mechanisms by which such specific interaction could result in sorting to the inner nuclear membrane.",

Cell fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy (Yuan, J., H. J. Worman, and G. Blobel, unpublished results) revealed that LBR is exclusively localized in the inner nuclear membrane. LBR's eDNA deduced primary structure showed a protein of 637 amino acid residues with two major domains: an amino terminal hydrophilic and basic domain of 205 residues followed by a predominantly hydrophobic region with eight putative transmembrane segments . The amino terminal domain of 205 residues is likely located on the nucleoplasmic (rather than the cisternal) side of the inner membrane because it contains all of LBR's consensus sites for various kinases (Feramisco et al., 1980; Moreno and Nurse, 1990) and LBR has been shown to be a phosphoprotein (Applebaum et al., 1990) . The amino terminal nucleoplasmic domain of LBR also contains SPXX motifs that are characteristic of nucleic acid binding proteins (Suzuki, 1989) . It is not known, however, whether LBR interacts with nucleic acids.",

Blobel, and J. C. Courvalin, unpublished results) in conjunction with the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at specific sites of the LBR nucleoplasmic domain (Courvalin et al., 1992) . Because of its topology this domain is a candidate for containing LBR's lamin B binding site, which in turn is a candidate for being a determinant for sorting LBR to the inner nuclear membrane. Like other membrane proteins that are newly integrated into the RER membrane system (Bergmann and Singer, 1983; Torrisi and Bonatti, 1985; Torrisi et al., 1987; Powell and Burke, 1990 ) LBR would have access to the inner nuclear membrane through lateral diffusion via the pore membrane domain of the nuclear envelope. Once there, it could simply be tethered by binding to larnin B. Using in vivo expression of full-length, truncated, and chimeric LBR cDNAs we found, however, that it is not the nucleoplasmic domain but the region of the first transmembrane segment that constitutes the primary determinant for sorting of LBR to the inner nuclear membrane.",

As the ER and the nuclear envelope are one continuous membrane system that is accessible by lateral diffusion to all membrane proteins targeted to and integrated into the ER, the exclusive nuclear rim staining of HA-tagged p58 can be considered to represent correct sorting to the inner nuclear membrane.

It has been known for some time now (Furthmayr and Marchesi, 1976; Deisenhofer et al., 1985; Bormann et al., 1989; Lemmon et al., 1992 ) that a transmembrane o~-helix is capable of specific interaction with another transmembrane or-helix. One possibility is that the transmembrane u-helix of a specific \"sorting receptor\" recognizes the transmembrane u-helix of LBR. Lateral movement of the complex along the outer nuclear membrane and the pore membrane domain of the nuclear envelope would carry LBR to the inner nuclear membrane where it might be dissociated from the \"sorting receptor\" and be retained through its interaction with lamin B and/or other intranuclear components. Another possibility is that the first transmembrane segment of one LBR molecule would specifically interact with the first transmembrane segment of another LBR molecule to form a homodimer and a binding site for lamin B and/or other intranuclear components. Homodimerization could occur immediately following integration into the RER/outer nuclear membrane followed by a random lateral diffusion of the homodimer along the outer nuclear membrane and the pore membrane domain of the nuclear envelope and ligand induced retention at the inner nuclear membrane. Alternatively, LBR monomers may reach the inner nuclear membrane, again via random lateral diffusion along the pore membrane domain of the nuclear envelope followed by a ligand (lamin B and/or intranuclear components) stabilized homodimerization and retention in the inner nuclear mem-brane. Similar scenarios can be considered if the first transmembrane segment of LBR would specifically recognize the transmembrane segment of another integral membrane protein to form a heterodimer.",

As mentioned in the introduction, the nucleoplasmic domain, by virtue of its topology, is an attractive candidate for containing LBR's lamin B binding site. However, the finding that the nncleoplasmic domain, although able to localize to the nucleoplasm, is not able to localize to the nuclear rim suggests that, per se, it is unable to compete with LBR for lamin B binding and thereby to attain the status of a \"peripheral\" membrane protein of the inner nuclear membrane. The ability of the nucleoplasmic domain to localize to the nucleoplasm remains to be investigated. Although this domain does not contain a minimal consensus nuclear localization signal (Chelsky et al., 1989) , the protein is small enough so that it might diffuse into the nucleus (Paine et al., 1975) and localize there by retention. The distribution of the protein throughout the nucleoplasm suggests an affinity for a ubiquitous nuclear component, such as chromatin rather than a peripheral one like the lamina. Affinity for chromatin is consistent with the SPXX motifs that are present in the nucleoplasmic domain and that are common to many DNA binding proteins.",

The specific in-formation residing in the primary structure of the transmembrahe o~-helix appears to be decoded via specific interaction with another transmembrane c~-helix to form dimers. Such dimerization has been shown to be important in signal transduction (reviewed by Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990; De Vos et al., 1992) and is likely to be involved in protein degradation (Bonifacino et al., 1990a,b) and in protein topogenesis (see above).",
