Our current understanding of virulence evolution is based on insights drawn from two perspectives that have developed largely independently: long-standing evolutionary theory based on limited real data examples that often lack a genomic basis, and experimental studies of virulence-determining mutations using cell culture or animal models. A more comprehensive understanding of virulence mutations and their evolution can be achieved by bridging the gap between these two research pathways through the phylogenomic analysis of virus genome sequence data as a guide to experimental study.",

Is there any consistent association between host-jumping and virulence such that predictions can be made about how virulence might evolve following emergence?

To be as general as possible, we assume a simple working definition of virulence: the harm caused by pathogen infection, particularly in terms of host morbidity and mortality. Virulence is also a complex trait determined by a combination of pathogen, host and environmental factors. Although it is obviously necessary to understand all three, we focus on the pathogen (virus) component as this is the most tractable, with the small genomes and rapid replication and evolution of viruses facilitating comparative and experimental studies, and because there is strong evidence for heritable virus genetic variation for virulence 2 . Although we purposely focus on the analysis of virus genomes, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) promise to open up new ways to explore the evolutionary impact of viral infections on host genomes 3 and hence the intimate interaction between host and virus 4 .",

Determining which microorganism is the cause of a particular disease syndrome can be troublesome, and it is possible that overt illness might result from synergistic interactions between multiple microorganisms that overwhelm the host. Hence, the model of one pathogen-one disease that has dominated studies of human infections, and implicitly models of virulence evolution, may be overly simplistic. It is also possible that measurements of relative virulence vary between humans and wildlife populations. For example, whereas dengue is considered an important infectious disease of humans, the virulence of dengue virus is low in terms of overall mortality in humans, and infections of equivalent severity may go unnoticed in wildlife, particularly as there is a strong sampling bias towards the most virulent presentations.",

Although theory and empiricism have each generated important and parallel insights, they have each been able to paint only a partial picture of virulence evolution. Few attempts have been made to bridge this divide 8,9 . There is now a large body of long-standing evolutionary theory that considers what level of virulence maximizes pathogen fitness under variable conditions, such as differing modes of transmission, levels of co-infection, selection pressures, and both within and between hosts 10 . Although of great value, a drawback is that this work is unavoidably based on a small number of case studies, the most famous of which is the co-evolution of myxoma virus (MYXV) and European rabbits following the release of MYXV as a biological control 11 .

These studies are often very successful in pinpointing causal mutations (see are not considered in an evolutionary context, their relevance for general theories of virulence evolution is usually ignored. In addition, in vitro methods may not reflect real-world selection pressures, there may be little consideration about how virulence mutations affect inter-host transmission, and animal models commonly differ from the species infected in the field. For example, virulence determinants in MYXV identified on the basis of in vitro studies and mouse models have often not been upheld in reverse genetic experiments using the natural rabbit host 17 . Similarly, despite the regularity of their use, there has been a long-standing debate over the validity of ferrets as accurate models for human influenza 18 . Bridging the gap between the theoretical and empirical approaches would bring a new impetus to studies of virulence evolution. In this Review, we outline how this can be achieved within a phylogenomics framework. We show that virus phylogenies are being increasingly used to help identify virulence determinants and that the data obtained can be used to test general theories of virulence evolution. Such a phylogenomic approach to studying virulence evolution is timely because of the rapidity with which virus genome sequence data are now being generated, including during ongoing disease outbreaks of emerging viruses [19] [20] [21] , and because of the development of new phylogeny-based methods for studying and visualizing genomic data [22] [23] [24] . However, the success of this approach also requires that phylogenomic data are combined with relevant clinical, epidemiological and experimental metadata so that a direct link can be made between virulence, virus genotype and phenotype, and population fitness.",

To make meaningful inferences, it is important to compare virulence in both the reservoir (that is, donor) and novel (that is, recipient) host species. Although this may sound straightforward and is tractable in some cases 25 , in reality it faces a number of difficulties. In many cases, including common infections such as hepatitis C virus 26 , as well as emerging infectious diseases such as Zika virus (ZIKV), the reservoir species is unknown or is at best uncertain. Even if a reservoir species is known, we generally know little, if anything, about virulence in that species, and there is likely to be an ascertainment bias towards the most virulent cases. For example, although species of fruit bats appear to be reservoirs for Ebola virus (EBOV) 27 , little is known about its virulence in these animals 28 , as is true of many wildlife infections. The identification of host species may also change with better sampling, which is invariably poor in wildlife. For example, it was long thought that the canine parvovirus (CPV) that emerged in dogs in the late 1970s had jumped from cats infected by a closely related virus 29 . However, more recent sampling of wild carnivore species has shown this to be incorrect, such that the true reservoir species for CPV is unclear 30 . Therefore, it is crucial to understand disease processes, including virulence, in reservoir hosts under natural conditions, which will require more detailed studies of animal ecology.",

Because there is a very large literature base on this subject, we necessarily provide only a brief overview here. A straightforward interpretation of virulence evolution is that natural selection will optimize the level of virulence that maximizes pathogen fitness, expressed as the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) 1 , although in reality fitness is shaped by a complex set of host-pathogen interactions 38, 39 . Current evolutionary theory tells us that when a virus jumps to a new species, its initial virulence can vary from asymptomatic to highly pathogenic, and precisely where it lies on this virulence spectrum is difficult to predict. However, it is possible that the direction of virulence evolution can be anticipated, at least in part, if the key relationship between virulence and transmissibility, and hence fitness, is understood. Importantly, there is also evidence from insect viruses that host phylogeny is able to predict some aspects of virulence evolution following species jumps, with related host species tending to have similar levels of virulence 25 .",

In the case of MYXV, this trade-off is thought to lead to 'intermediate' virulence grades being selectively advantageous: higher virulence may mean that the rabbit host dies before interhost transmission, whereas lower virulence is selected against because it does not increase virus transmission rates. A similar trade-off model has been proposed to explain the evolution of HIV virulence 40 . However, many doubts have been raised about the general applicability of the trade-off model 35, [41] [42] [43] , virus fitness will be affected by traits other than virulence and transmissibility 39, 41, 44 , contrary results have been observed in experimental studies 45 and relatively little is known about evolutionary trade-offs in nature. For example, in the case of the second virus released as a biocontrol against European rabbits in Australia -rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) -there is evidence that virulence has increased through time, probably because virus transmission often occurs through blow flies that feed on animal carcasses, making host death selectively favourable 46 . Similarly, experimental studies of plant RNA viruses have shown that high virulence does not necessarily impede host adaptation 47 and, in the case of malaria, higher virulence www.nature.com/nrg Reverse genetics experimental method used to identify gene function by modifying the sequence of a target gene and analysing its phenotypic consequences.",

Similarly, rabies virus (RABv) causes an equally severe, ultimately fatal encephalitis in foxes and dogs and following spillover to humans 142 . \u2022 Cases of decreased virulence may be largely overlooked because avirulent viruses will often persist in a host population without detection. An example of decreased virulence following a host jump may be that of the infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNv) that spread from sockeye salmon to rainbow trout in North America and Japan (see the figure, part c). upon the initial cross-species transmission event in the 1950s to 1960s, the virus seemed at first to be avirulent in the new host in contrast to the mortality seen in sockeye salmon. Since then, however, virulence in some genotypes of IHNv in rainbow trout has increased, itself associated with an increase in transmissibility 143, 144 . For many diseases, however, the extent of changes in virulence upon emergence is not known, in part because little is usually known about disease epidemiology in reservoir hosts, and there is likely to be a sampling bias towards the cases of highest virulence.

Conversely, a virulence determinant that occurs sporadically on shallow branches and is subject to strong purifying (negative) selection suggests that virulence is not directly beneficial, probably because it inhibits some other component of overall fitness. In such cases, each instance of high virulence may represent an independent and transient evolutionary event. If only a single mutation is associated with a change in virus virulence, as in the case of WNV, then this change in virulence is likely to be selectively advantageous without an evolutionary trade-off with transmissibility, as a reduction in transmissibility would probably need to be compensated for by additional reciprocal mutations located elsewhere in the genome.

Phylogenomic analysis revealed that a single Thr249Pro (T249P) amino acid substitution in the virus NS3 helicase protein was associated with high-virulence WNV outbreaks in corvids on multiple continents. Experimental analysis in captive crows then showed that this mutation was sufficient to explain the high fatality rates in American crows, perhaps because it increased the rate of virus replication 58 . WNV therefore provides an important example of where a single genetic switch controls virulence, which is obviously the easiest scenario to detect using a phylogenomic approach. Of more general importance was that T249P evolved in parallel and experienced an elevated rate of nonsynonymous change, suggesting that high virulence was selectively favoured in the absence of an evolutionary trade-off as no reciprocal mutations were observed elsewhere in the viral genome 58 ",

Grade I strains were released in both Australia (starting strain, SlS) and Europe (starting strain, lausanne) in the early 1950s, and soon after lower virulence viruses began to appear in parallel in both continents, with intermediate virulence grades (for example, grade III) becoming the most common in the field.",

That the trajectory of virulence evolution was the same in both Australia and Europe meant that the same virulence determinants might be involved on both continents. Therefore, it was a surprise when the first large-scale genome comparisons of MYXv revealed that virulence grades changed frequently across the virus phylogeny, as depicted in the phylogeny, and that different mutations appeared in the Australian and European epidemics (depicted as different filled shapes at branch tips), with no parallel evolution of possible virulence determinants within Australia and Europe 94, 145 . For example, there were no mutations that were unique to the most attenuated grade v viruses, nor to the highest virulence grade I viruses. Hence, there are multiple genetic routes to attenuation or virulence in MYXv, such that there has been convergent evolution for phenotype but not genotype, and both attenuating and virulence-restoring mutations have been fixed in Australian MYXv. Therefore, there is no simple way to predict virulence evolution from genome-scale comparisons in the case of MYXv and no parallel or convergent evolution to guide experimentation. Indeed, experimentally verified virulence determinants in rabbits remain elusive 17 .",

In both Australia and Europe, highly virulent strains of MYXV were used as a biological control against the European rabbit population, with releases beginning in the early 1950s. In both continents, the same trajectory of virulence evolution was observed: virulence declined from the highly virulent (that is, grade I) release strains to encompass a far wider range of virulence grades, including the most attenuated grade V strains, with strains of 'intermediate' virulence the most commonly sampled in the field. This pattern, reflecting a combination of the virus evolving more attenuated strains and the host developing resistance, fuelled the idea of a trade-off between virulence and transmissibility.",

Although which mutations had the greatest impact on virulence is still unclear and requires further experimental analysis, such a phylogenomic pattern indicates that there are multiple routes to achieving the same levels of virulence, including attenuation, such that there has been convergent evolution for phenotype but not genotype. It is likely that this evolutionary flexibility in part reflects the fairly large genome size of MYXV (a double-stranded DNA virus of ~160,000 bp), which may mean that there is a large number of potential virulence determinants that can interact through epistasis 96 , in turn complicating any phylogenomic analysis.",

Whether 'imperfect' (that is, 'leaky') vaccination against infectious disease, in which disease symptoms are reduced but there is less impact on virus replication and transmission, will change the selection pressures acting on the pathogen and affect virulence evolution has been the source of debate 97, 98 . Although still contentious, particularly in the case of human disease, there is good evidence that imperfect vaccination has increased virulence in the case of MDV, a DNA herpesvirus that poses a major problem to the poultry industry 99 . In the 1960s, the appearance of virulent MDV strains forced the development of the first generation of Marek's disease vaccines. However, because these vaccines were imperfect, 'very virulent' MDV began to appear within 10 years, necessitating a second-generation vaccine. This very virulent MDV was followed, more rapidly, by the appearance of 'very virulent plus' MDV, requiring a third-generation vaccine (FIg. 3) . Imperfect MDV vaccines enhance virulence by elongating the infectious periods and hence transmission potential of virulent strains that would have been removed by natural selection before transmission in the absence of vaccination 99 . Although the genomic basis to MDV virulence evolution is currently uncertain, with some causative amino acid changes proposed 100 , initial phylogenomic studies suggest that, as in the case of MYXV, there are multiple genetic pathways to high virulence 101 (and which again may reflect the fairly large size of the viral genome). Not only does virulence evolution in MDV have important implications for vaccination strategies against other diseases in which vaccine efficacy is fairly low 102 , but it also shows that in some circumstances increased virulence can be selectively advantageous.",

In support is evidence that SPVL, and hence virulence, has declined in some African HIV subtypes, even accounting for the use of antiviral therapy, and that this reflects a trade-off between virulence and transmissibility 114 . Importantly, however, despite many studies into the determinants of HIV virulence, the virus genomic mutations responsible for determining SPVL are still uncertain and multiple genes may be involved 104 . The difficulty in assigning the genetic determinants of SPVL may be in part due to genetic variation across viral populations 111 . For example, heritability in SPVL was highest (~60%) between individuals in the Swiss HIV cohort, which also represents the most homogenous viral population 113 Marek's disease virus (MDV) of chickens present on poultry farms. This imperfect vaccine reduced disease symptoms but did not prevent virus replication, thereby extending the infectious periods, and hence potential for transmission, of virulent strains that would have been removed by natural selection before transmission to a new host in the pre-vaccine era 99 . Because of this, 'very virulent' MDV began to appear within 10 years, necessitating the development of a secondgeneration vaccine that was also imperfect. This was followed, in an even shorter period, by the appearance of 'very virulent plus' MDV, requiring a third-generation vaccine.

However, these apparent changes in phenotype also coincided with the movement of the virus from Guinea to Sierra Leone, such that any change in case numbers and mortality could in fact be due to a change in epidemiological factors (such as access to health care or differing human demographics and/or transmission networks), and recent studies using animal models suggest that A82V has no direct impact on virulence 118 .",

            "text": "ZIKV is the most recent emerging virus to lead to a major public health scare and is puzzling because a seemingly benign virus suddenly increased in virulence, causing severe neurological disease in humans. Before 2007, there were fewer than 20 human cases of ZIKV reported and all were mild infections restricted to Africa and Asia 9,119 . Consequently, neither the disease caused by ZIKV nor the molecular determinants of ZIKV virulence were well characterized, and it is likely that there was systematic under-reporting of infections, including those associated with severe disease. In 2007, the Pacific Islands reported the first major outbreaks of ZIKV before the virus spread to the Americas in 2014. Although the majority of human infections range from asymptomatic to mild, the virus was associated with the neurological Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in French Polynesia in 2013 (ReF. 120 ), and those cases from the Americas, particularly Brazil, were linked to more severe diseases, including congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly 121 . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the most recent Zika epidemics are due to the Asian lineage of ZIKV, rather than the African lineage 122 , and that the virus spread cryptically in Brazil for at least a year before its detection 20 . Although there are multiple amino acid differences between the African and Asian lineages 122, 123 , it has been claimed that those in the Asian lineage that spread through the Americas may be directly linked to both increased infectivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes 124 and microcephaly, most notably a Ser139Asn (S139N) amino acid change in the PrM protein 125 . However, there is still considerable uncertainty in this area, with others arguing that viruses from both lineages can cause neurovirulence but that cases often go unreported 9, 126 . Hence, the case of ZIKV highlights the difficulty in assessing virulence evolution within a background of sparse and biased sampling even with phylogenomic data and shows the importance of collecting reliable, real-time epidemiological data even in low-incidence situations. 70, 116 . Maps above the phylogeny show the spread of EBOV over the timeline of the outbreak in the three affected countries in West Africa, where blue-shaded regions correspond to the wild-type virus variant (A82) and redshaded areas correspond to mutated virus variant (V82). It is possible that A82V was also associated with an increase in both EBOV case numbers and mortality (that is, virulence) as the outbreak progressed, such that increased virulence is directly selectively advantageous, although this is confounded by epidemiological factors.",

Recent advances in real-time genomics during disease outbreaks 127, 128 and the increased demand for precision in public health interventions may help in the development of a new understanding of the evolution of pathogen virulence. We contend that this can be achieved within a phylogenomic framework as long as relevant data are available and strong links are made between genomics, phylogenetics, epidemiology, and experimental studies of virus virulence and fitness. Therefore, it is critically important to collect clinical (that is, disease symptoms and severity) and epidemiological (that is, time and place of sampling) metadata concurrently with the sequencing of virus genomes and to sample across a range of clinical syndromes, not just those associated with severe disease. We also stress the value of gathering concurrent and historical data from likely reservoir species as these will provide a more complete insight into virulence evolution and determining the full range of microorganisms that infect a particular species, as well as their interactions, as assigning disease syndromes to individual pathogens may often be difficult. Thankfully, advances in metagenomics now make the latter task feasible 6, 7, 129 . Similarly, there is a marked lack of good virulence grading schemes among viral infections. Although such schemes can sometimes be simplistic, assuming discrete virulence categories that may not exist in nature and incorporating degrees of subjectivity, the case of MYXV shows that they are key to considering the relationship between genotype and phenotype that is essential to understanding virulence evolution.",

Although predicting where and when a new disease might emerge is clearly unfeasible because of the immense complexities involved 54, 130 , predicting the overall trajectory of the virulence evolution of a virus in a novel host may be more achievable. Once again, biocontrol presents a compelling example. Although controversial [131] [132] [133] , the proposed release of cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) as a biological control against invasive common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) in Australia may present a unique opportunity to follow, in real time, the co-evolution between host and virus at both the genotypic and phenotypic scales. Both theory and virus natural history predict that CyHV-3 virulence will decline with time 134 , and it will be interesting and informative to see how any such virulence evolution is manifest in phylogenomic data.",
