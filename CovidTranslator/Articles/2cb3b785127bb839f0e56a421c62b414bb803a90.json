Ribavirin was administered daily for 10 to 14 days at 16.5 mg kg -1 bodyweight given per os, intramuscularly or intravenously beginning 18 hours after kittens were challenge-exposed with FIPV. All kittens, including ribavirin-treated and untreated kittens, succumbed to FIP. Clinical signs of disease were more severe in the ribavirin-treated kittens and their mean survival times were shortened. The clinical efficacy of free ribavirin given intravenously at a reduced dosage (5.5 mg kg -1 bodyweight) was compared to that of ribavirin incorporated into lecithin-containing liposomes (5 mg kg -1) intravenously. Drugs were given once daily for three consecutive days of each week for three weeks, beginning 18 hours after virus challenge exposure. There was no significant difference either in survival rate or severity of disease between kittens given free ribavirin, liposomal ribavirin or saline only. Because of its intrinsic toxicity and low therapeutic index against FIPV and its marginal antiviral activities in vivo at maximal doses, ribavirin cannot presently be recommended as primary antiviral chemotherapy against FIP.",

Administration of liposomeencapsulated ribavirin in mice infected with Rift Valley fever virus resulted in liver ribavirin concentrations that were fivefold greater than those attained with the same doses of free ribavirin; mice challenge exposed with lethal amounts of virus, moreover, were protected against disease, whereas those treated with the same dose of free drug succumbed to the lethal infection (Kende et al 1985) .",

The ribavirin-treated kittens actually had more severe weight loss and other clinical signs of disease, decreased survival times and more severe haemorrhagic lesions after FIPV challenge exposure than untreated kittens, suggesting clinical toxicity at this dosage. Despite this increased severity of clinical signs, ribavirin-treated kittens had some delay in onset of fever after virus inoculation and had decreased mean VNA responses on day 10, suggesting some antiviral activity by ribavirin in vivo. The delayed onset of clinical signs and reduced VNA titres in ribavirintreated kittens after FIPV challenge exposure, however, may have been caused by initial immunosuppressive or myelotoxic effects of the drug rather than direct antiviral actions. A similar effect on early clinical disease and antibody titres was observed in FIPV experimentally infected kittens treated daily with immunosuppressive doses of infectious peritonitis 169 interferon-o~ in a previous study (Weiss et al 1990) . Ribavirin toxicity in cats has been demonstrated previously in vitro and also in vivo at higher dosages than those reported in these trials (Povey 1978 a, b, Weiss and Tovio-Kinnucan 1988 , Weiss and Oostrom-Ram 1989 , Weiss et al 1993 . The toxic effects of ribavirin in kittens, namely thrombocytopenia and suppression of bone marrow erythroid and myeloid precursors (Povey 1978a , Weiss et al 1993 , may have increased the severity of clinical disease induced by FIPV in kittens of the present study and aggravated some of the clinicopathological findings of FIP including thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and anaemia (Weiss and Scott 1980 , Weiss 1989a , 1991 . Although complete blood and platelet counts were not carried out in the kittens of this study, the findings of more severe and disseminated haemorrhagic lesions in the kittens treated with ribavirin compared to untreated kittens strongly suggested that the pathological effects induced by FIPV, and the toxic effects induced by ribavirin, were additive. Similarly, ribavirin at much higher dosages (25 mg kg -1 bodyweight, given three times daily per os) enhanced the severity of disease, lesions (including severe haemorrhage) and clinicopathological findings in kittens infected with feline calicivirus (Povey 1978a) . Because ribavirin alone seemed too toxic to use at dosages likely to be therapeutic, the authors attempted to deliver smaller doses of the drug specifically to tissues and cells infected with virus, using ribavirin-encapsulated liposomes as a carrier-mediated antiviral therapy. The rationale was that effective targeting of liposomes containing ribavirin to target cells of FIPV, namely mononuclear phagocytes in the liver, lung, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes (Ward 1970 , Weiss and Scott 1981a , b, Weiss 1989a ) would result in more precise delivery of antiviral dosages of ribavirin to these cells and thus minimise its distribution to other tissues. It was hoped that the therapeutic dosage would effectively be lowered, thereby reducing toxicity. Previous studies indicated that liposomes are taken up by macrophages in vitro and in vivo (Bonventre and Gregoriadis 1978 , Alving 1983 , MacEwen 1987 and that liposomes administered intravenously concentrate in organs with sinusoidal capillaries containing reticuloendothelial cells, such as the liver, spleen, and bone marrow (Ladigina and Vladimirsky 1986, Popescu et al 1987) . Liposome encapsulation of antimicrobial drugs dramatically improves therapeutic efficacy in various diseases, particularly those associated with disseminated intracellular pathogens (Alving 1983 , Kende et al 1985 , 1988 , Ladigina and V!adimirsky 1986 , Popescu et al 1987 and may reduce bone marrow toxicity of antiviral agents such as 3'-azido-3' deoxythymidine (AZT) (Phillips et al 1991) .",

The rationale for lowering the challenge dose of FIPV was to maximise the chances that a positive treatment effect from either free or liposome incorporated ribavirin would be observed and that the kittens would not be overchallenged with virus; it is generally recognised that antivirals often fail at high inocula of challenge virus. The concentration of ribavirin was lowered both to minimise toxicity and also to compare the effect of targeting low doses of drug in liposomes with the effect of equivalent doses of free drug. Unfortunately, the FIPV-infected kittens treated with liposome-encapsulated ribavirin were not protected against induced FIP. Kittens given empty liposomes and challenged with FIPV actually had an increased mortality rate compared to untreated kittens or those given liposomal ribavirin. The reason for the decreased survival in kittens given empty liposomes was unclear; liposome-mediated toxicity or perhaps enhancement of FIPV replication oi\" immunopathological effects secondary to release of cytokines from liposomeactivated macrophages may have occurred. Curiously, kittens given equivalent volumes of liposomes with ribavirin had a better survival rate than kittens given empty liposomes only, suggesting that the antiviral effects attributed to ribavirin in these cats may have counterbalanced the deleterious effects of the liposomes. The fact that kittens that had not been challenge exposed with FIPV which were given empty liposomes only did not have notable gross or microscopic changes in their tissues, including bone marrow, argues against a profound toxic effect of the liposomes; haematological or biochemical changes, however, were not quantified in these kittens. Another explanation for the lack of efficacy observed with liposomeencapsulated ribavirin could be that the liposomes were not distributed effectively to the sites of viral replication, or that the amount of ribavirin incorporated into liposomes was suboptimal. The dosage of ribavirin used to load the liposomes (5.5",

This dosage was also not therapeutic, and moderately higher dosages (for example, 16-5 mg kg -1 bodyweight) were apparently too toxic, exacerbating clinical disease. It was still unclear why the free ribavirin was more effective than the liposomeincorporated drug at equivalent concentrations, unless there was liposome-mediated toxicity or modulation of macrophages or other cells that somehow affected viral processing or antiviral immunity. Apparently, the liposomes were unable to target effectively sufficient antiviral doses of ribavirin to critical cell populations and thus failed to prevent or treat disease manifestations of FIP. Species differences in drug tolerance (that is, the therapeutic index of ribavirin for FIPV in cats compared to other mammals) may have contributed to the relative lack of efficacy of free or liposomeencapsulated ribavirin-treated animals in other studies (Kende et al 1985) . In practice, the therapeutic window observed with dosages of ribavirin used in this study seemed too narrow to be clinically useful if ribavirin is to be considered as primary antiviral treatment of FIP in cats.",

            "text": "Previous in vitro studies of ribavirin indicated that even near toxic levels are not totally inhibitory to FIPV (Weiss and Oostrom-Ram 1989) . Considering that FIP is essentially an immunemediated disease initially induced by rapid virus replication in macrophages rather than the classical type of viral disease associated with viral cytopathicity, it is conceivable that even very small amounts of virus persisting in vivo during and after ribavirin treatment were sufficient to elicit immunopathological responses and thus cause progressive disease. The authors' intention in using an antiviral drug like ribavirin as primary treatment for FIP in cats in an acute infection model was to suppress initial viral replication before immunopathological responses were induced. Their intention was not to inhibit direct viral cytopathic effects. If immunopathological responses none the less occurred, it was hoped that the suppression of the circulating viral load using antiviral drugs would largely inhibit the direct stimulus for antibody production and thereby diminish the generation of pathogenic immune complexes. Accordingly, the relative amount of complement-mediated inflammation, necrosis and vasculitis would be reduced, thereby allowing the host to recover from the severe immunologically mediated inflammatory reactions and catabolic effects that characterise the disease. Apparently, the amount of antiviral activity induced by ribavirin in the cats in this study was ineffective in modulating immunopathological responses therapeutically. Arguably, cats with clinical FIP are presented at a later stage of disease when treatment may be attempted than were the cats in this acute experimental study. Conceivably, there is relatively much less viral replication or viraemia and perhaps different degrees or types of immunopathological injury induced in cats with natural disease compared to kittens with experimentally induced disease. An acute infection model, however, is still relevant to the study of natural FIP. Notwithstanding observations that FIPV can be difficult to isolate in clinical specimens of natural disease, particularly non-effusive cases of FIP (possibly because the virus is so markedly cell-associated, complexed strongly with antibody, or perhaps degraded by proteases and other enzymes released during intense inflammatory reactions), it is possible that at least small amounts of virus continue to replicate and circulate in vivo during clinical disease and induce immunopathological lesions via immune complexes or other mechanisms. Failure of antiviral therapy to ameliorate immunopathological disease (by suppressing viral production) in the experimental disease suggests that this approach alone would probably be ineffective in the natural disease where the immunological problems undoubtedly are more advanced.",

Incorporation of ribavirin into liposomes to target less toxic concentrations of the drug more specifically to macrophages in various infected tissues was also unsuccessful in preventing fatal FIP. Because ribavirin has been shown to induce synergistic antiviral effects against FIPV when combined with other agents such as human interferon-(z in vitro (Weiss and Oostrom-Ram 1989) and because some improvement in clinical responses was induced by low dosages of ribavirin in the cats of this study, additional clinical studies of low doses of ribavirin combined with interferon in FIPVinfected cats may be useful. Considering also that host resistance against FIPV is allegedly related to a strong cellular immune response Black 1983, Weiss 1989a) , effective therapy for infectious peritonitis FIP as suggested previously may ultimately depend upon the use of multiple drugs, using a combination of antiviral, immunomodulating and antiinflammatory agents (Weiss 1989b, Barlough and Scott 1990) .",
