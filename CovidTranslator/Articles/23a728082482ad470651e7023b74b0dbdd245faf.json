Parasitol., The chemoprophylactic effects of halofuginone lactate were tested against calf experimental cryptosporidiosis. Twenty 2-day-old calves, divided into four groups, were orally inoculated with 1 \u00d7 106 oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. The infected control group was unmedicated whereas the three other groups were medicated with the drug at 30, 60 and 120/lg kg-~ day-~, respectively, for 7 days, from Day (D)2 to D8 post-inoculation (D 0 was inoculation day). The calves were weighed twice weekly and disease development and drug efficacy were assessed daily from DO to D30 from consistency of feces, shedding of oocysts and mortality. Experimental C. parvum infection caused a severe clinical disease with profuse watery diarrhea, high oocyst shedding and mortality (3 out of 5 ) in the unmedicated group. The results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of halofuginone lactate in reducing the severity of clinical cryptosporidiosis. This efficacy was dose-dependent. The lowest dose (30 #g kg-t day-' ) was not able to prevent clinical disease and mortality ( 3 out of 5 ). No clinical signs were observed with the 60 and 120/tg kg -~ day -1 doses, but the animals shed oocysts after drug withdrawal. This shedding was more delayed the higher the dose of drug administered, but the delayed shedding had no effect on the growth of the animals.",

            "text": "The protozoan Cryptosporidium parvum is an important coccidial parasite of intestinal and respiratory tracts in several species of vertebrates, including humans. Although concurrent infections with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli K99, rotaviruses and coronaviruses can occur in neonatal calves, C. parvurn alone may cause severe diarrhea, weight loss, dehydration and mortality. More than 80 antimicrobial drugs, including coccidiostats or antiprotozoal drugs (Moon et al., 1982a,b; Tzipori et al., 1982; Angus et al., 1984; Kim, 1987; Lindsay et al., 1987; Naciri and Yvor6 1989; Regh and Hancock, 1990; Villacorta et al., 1991 ) , broad-spectrum antibiotics (Sloper et al., 1982 ) , sulphamids (Nagy and Pohlenz, 1982; Fischer, 1983; Gunther, 1983 Gunther, , 1984 Naciri et al., 1984) and even anthelminthics (Stemmermann et al., 1980; Sloper et al., 1982) were shown to be inactive against Cryptosporidium in humans and animals. At this moment, only treatment with lasalocid-sodium ( 15 mg kg-~ body weight once a day for 3 days) in experimentally or naturally infected calves (G/Sbel, 1987 ) or with halofuginone lactate ( 500/~g kg-~ dayfor 3 days) in experimentally infected lambs (Naciri and Yvor6, 1989) has been shown to be effective. Halofuginone lactate is an anticoccidial drug initially used in the treatment of bovine theileriosis. Villacorta et al. ( 1991 ) established that halofuginone lactate at a dosage of 500/tg kg-1 day-1 was too close to the toxic concentration. They tested lower concentrations to try to avoid toxic effects while guaranteeing a security of about five. The drug was effective at a practical dose of 60 to 100/tg kg-1 day-~ for 7 consecutive days in neonatal calves naturally infected with C. parvum.",

The efficacy of the drug, administered from D2 to D8 p.i., before the appearance of clinical symptoms, is dose-dependent. A dose of 30/zg kg-~ day-1 was not able to prevent clinical disease as three calves out of five died as a result of the infection. With 60 or 120/~g kg-~ day-t no clinical symptoms were ob-served in any calf. Until D 13, all medicated groups showed negative weight gain or no weight gain at all. In our first experiments (Naciri and Yvorr, 1989) a dose of 500/tg kg-~ day-1 for 3 days was closely associated with a toxic side-effect. With 60 or 120 kg-l day-1 for 7 days, no sign of toxicity was observed, with the exception of the depression of weight gain during the medication period and until D 13. The depression of weight gain during the first days of life may be ascribed in part to the stress suffered by the animals after changes in rearing and feeding conditions. After D 13, both 60 and 120/zg kg-~ day-1 dosages allowed good growth in comparison with the unmedicated or 30/tg kg-~ day-~ medicated groups. Over a period of 31 days, the weights of the survivors of the two last-named groups did not increase further.",

With 30/tg kg-~ day-l a weak development of the parasite was noted during medication but not afterwards. With 60/tg kg-~ day-~ shedding occurred just after drug withdrawal (D9), and with 120 /tg kg-~ day-1 it started at D 18, but had no detrimental consequences on weight gain in the two last-named groups. Villacorta et al., ( 1991 ) observed similar effects after treatment of naturally infected calves. The number of animals which restarted shedding was also closely linked with the dose of halofuginone lactate administered. These authors argued that lower doses do not completely prevent development of the parasite and thus facilitate development of immunity and prevention of reinfection, while larger doses, which stop the cryptosporidia life cycle completely, prevent development of immunity and leave the animals susceptible to reinfection. In practical conditions, it is possible that calves become reinfected, but in our experiment the animals received only one dose of C. parvum oocysts and were housed separately, so the chances of reinfection were limited. Perhaps the delayed oocyst shedding reflects the pharmacodynamics and the mode of action of halofuginone lactate in the host: it seems to indicate that the drug is cryptosporidiostatic and only inhibits parasite development. With other coccidia (e.g. Eimeria), Long and Millard ( 1968 ) observed that sporozoites ofEimeria tenella and Eimeria acervulina can develop following drug withdrawal even after treating with meticlorpindol for as long as 60 days.",

This recurrence of oocyst shedding had no consequence on either weight gain or growth (Naciri and Yvorr, 1989) . This period of 4 days corresponds to the prepatent period of C. parvum. All these data from lambs and calves might indicate that the drug may destroy the schizogonic and gamogonic stages but only inhibit the sporozoites which restart infection after drug withdrawal. In avian coccidiosis, it has been shown that other anticoccidial drugs are clinically effective against Eimeria even when they do not completely stop elimination of oocysts.
