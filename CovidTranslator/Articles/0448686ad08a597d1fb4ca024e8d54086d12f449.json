As she did not speak Italian, she requested a house call through an Englishspeaking medical provider. She reported cold-like symptoms, fatigue, cough, and odynophagia lasting a week. Physical examination revealed cervical lymphadenopathy and tonsillar hypertrophy, with purulent exudate, and no fever. The patient was started on an empiric antibiotic course with macrolides. Two weeks after the first assessment, she reported the onset of mild non-radiating chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and reduced exercise tolerance, without symptoms at rest. Thus, she underwent a cardiological evaluation: physical examination was Myocarditis is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening disease. Clinical manifestations could range from subclinical disease to sudden death, due to fulminant heart failure and/or malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The most common cause of myocarditis is viral infection, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Nevertheless, EBV rarely presents with cardiac involvement in immunocompetent hosts. We report a case of acute EBV-related myocarditis in a young female, complicated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. After 20 days of hospitalization and treatment, the patient was fit for discharge on pharmacological therapy (tapering steroids, beta-blockers, amiodarone, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics). Clinical course is described, cardiac magnetic resonance images are shown. This case underlines how myocarditis is a disease that should not be underestimated: it could present with life-threatening complications such as malignant arrhythmias and/or severe systolic dysfunction. <Learning objective: Although Epstein-Barr virus rarely presents with cardiac involvement in immunocompetent hosts, the risk should not be underestimated, as it could present with lifethreatening complications.> \u00a9 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Japanese College of Cardiology.",
