            "text": "The ID physicians are a critically important constituency for health departments, as indicated by their knowledge of how to reach their health departments for an urgent issue and the high percentage who reported having contacted their health departments in the past 2 years. In a previous assessment by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 61% of respondents had contacted the health department in the past year. 5 Similarly, 76% of respondents to a survey by CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics and 83% of respondents to a survey by CDC and the American Academy of Family Physicians knew a primary contact at the state health department, and 83% and 57% of respondents to the 2 surveys, respectively, had contacted that person in the previous 12 months. 6 The majority of ID physicians in our survey described communications with their health department as outstanding or good. Despite mostly positive interactions between ID physicans and public health, we identified opportunities for improvement. A common challenge was knowing whom to contact at the health department and being able to reach that person directly. Staffing limitations may prevent health department personnel from being available immediately, but all health departments typically have a staff member on call, although this person may not be a physician. It may be helpful for ID physicians to become familiar with the health department's organizational structure to understand how the on-call individual reports to or relates to the usual health department contact. An emergency situation can sometimes serve as a catalyst for building trust between ID physicans and public health staff members who may not have an opportunity to interact with each other on a daily basis. For example, several respondents indicated that working together on Ebola preparedness resulted in improved contact with their health department overall. Receiving key information from a trusted source at the health department with whom the ID physician has worked closely in the past may be more important than receiving a large volume of material from health department personnel whom the physician does not know. 7 Numerous respondents commented on challenges in reporting notifiable diseases, including requests for lists of reportable conditions and the inability to report online. Many health departments already offer lists of reportable conditions and online reporting; thus, a simple solution to reporting challenges might be to inform ID physicians about such resources. In the future, notifiable disease surveillance could be improved by an informatics-driven approach. 8, 9 Since 2010, CDC has provided annual resources via the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Diseases cooperative agreement to 57 state, local, and territorial health departments to improve electronic laboratory reporting. 8 Regarding recent changes in communications technology, responses were mixed. Those with less ID experience were more likely than those with more ID experience to want a smartphone application. Years of ID experience may be a surrogate for age. Many ID physicians described alerts via email, fax, or text to be useful. The CDC Health Alert Network (HAN) items disseminated via email are a relatively simple and rapid channel for information sharing. Most statebased HANs cover more than 90% of their population. 10 Another potential resource is IDSA's Rapid Communications Task Force, which sends ID physicians succinct, urgent advisory emails with epidemiology updates, clinical aspects of diseases, diagnostics, case definitions, infection control, treatment, and exposure management information. 11 ",

Thus, other ID physicians could have different experiences of communications with their health departments. Second, questions relied on physican recall, and physicians may have forgotten instances during which they interacted with public health. Third, it is possible that survey respondents have more familiarity or interaction with health departments than nonrespondents, resulting in overestimation of the strength of these communication channels. Fourth, we focused on ID physicans. However, patients with emerging infections might present to an urgent care or outpatient clinic rather than an ID physician. Future surveys could focus on primary care physicans, who might be the first to encounter emerging infections.",
