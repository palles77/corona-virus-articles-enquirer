According to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience, anticipation of the pandemic may have impact on behaviors related to influenza vaccination (IV) and relevant public health behaviors such as wearing a face mask when having influenza-like-illnesses (ILI), which would play an important role in the control of human avian influenza outbreaks. This paper investigated the prevalence and factors related to IV uptake and use of face mask in public venues when having ILI symptoms. Methods: An anonymous cross-sectional population-based random telephone survey of 302 Hong Kong Chinese adults aged 18-60, using a structured questionnaire, was conducted in November 2005. Results: In the last 3 months, 17.9% of the respondents received IV; 36.6% of those presenting ILI symptoms often used face mask in public venues. Anticipation of a bird-tohuman H5N1 outbreak, perceptions that such an outbreak would be worse than SARS, that IV was efficacious in preventing bird-to-human avian influenza transmission were associated with the studied IV behavior (OR=2.64-3.97, p < 0.05). Exposure to live birds, perceived similar symptoms between influenza and bird-to-human H5N1 avian influenza, that bird-to-human avian influenza was more lethal than SARS were predictive use of face mask when having ILI symptoms (OR = 4.25-8.34, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of IV and use of face mask in the study population may be increasing, which may be related to concerns of avian influenza. Perceptions related to human avian influenza were associated with IV and mask use behaviors. This can potentially be turned into opportunities of promoting desirable public health behaviors.",

Other unconfirmed beliefs exist. For instance, 48% of the Hong Kong respondents believed that avian influenza could be transmitted via insect bites [27] . It is interesting to know that some unconfirmed beliefs (or even misconceptions) related to some emerging infectious diseases, were in fact, associated with desirable preventive behaviors. This may be due to the underlying fear of contracting the disease, a potential confounder, which is both associated with the unconfirmed beliefs and preventive behaviors in question. A recent web-based study in Norway has shown how fear and anxiety would distort decision making in the context of imminent influenza pandemic [37] . A paper reported that high percentages of Hong Kong people anticipated panic and interruption of daily routines in the event of a human influenza outbreak [25] . It would be an interesting topic of debate among health policy makers and workers in how to rectify misconceptions, without upsetting the associated desirable public health prevention behaviors. It is speculated that incidence of IV would decrease if the government firmly explained that there is no good evidence to support the claim that IV would prevent avian flu. The government should, however, explain the benefits of IV for preventing influenza, which would be problematic if there was a sudden avian flu outbreak. The public health behavior could still be promoted with a more scientific reason. The study further demonstrated that preventive behaviors of different types of infectious respiratory diseases are inter-related. The government can turn the threat of emerging infectious disease into opportunities for promoting relevant public health behaviors. The explanation of the advantages of IV and ILI preventive means (e.g., mask use, hand-washing) as a way to prepare for the outbreak of avian flu, therefore, has a promising chance of success. That is what currently the Hong Kong Government is doing and such promotion campaigns have long-term public health implications. As avian influenza has become a global concern, it is possible that the implications derived from the study can be generalized to other countries. A recent web-based study in Norway showed that though only a minority of the public perceived a risk greater than that of their health authorities estimates, most are ready to adopt some precautions [38] . Promotion of ILI-related prevention means should be considered as part of the avian flu preparedness.",

            "text": "The study has some limitations. First, the study was conducted using telephone surveys and some households may not have been included. In Hong Kong, however, almost all households have telephones [39] and a large number of local published studies on SARS [12, 14, 40] , influenza vaccination, [41] , and avian influenza [29] have utilized this method. Second, the response rate of the study has not been very high. Again, the response rate has been similar to many of the other local studies that have been published [13, 29, 42] with the distributions of 18-39 and 40-60 groups being quite comparable to those obtained from the Census data (49.6 and 50.4%, respectively). The gender distributions (46.6 and 53.4% male and female, respectively) were also comparable to the 2005 Census distributions of 47.8% male and 52.0% female [43] . The crude comparison with Census data give some support to the generalization of the results of the study. Responses such as IV and the use of face mask were self-reported and had not been validated. However, the study was anonymous and during this pre-outbreak stage, it is unlikely that social desirability strongly biased the reporting of these behaviors. Associations rather than causal effects were obtained in this cross-sectional study. In fact, many studies investigating factors predicting IV were of cross-sectional nature [6, 36, 41, 44] . Cohort studies are very difficult to set up as an individual's perceptions on avian flu can change. Recall bias is also unlikely to be significant due to the relatively short recall period of 1-3 months. The sample size is relatively small due to resource constraints. The obtained 95% confidence interval for the prevalence of IV and mask use were about 5-6% in width and the corresponding odds ratios are highly significant, which suggests that the sample size is adequate to address the research questions.",

Immediate behavioral changes related to avian influenza has been document [27] . It is speculated that when an avian flu outbreak occurs, changes in relevant perceptions would increase the prevalence of the studied public health behaviors rapidly. It may still be debatable whether such preventive measures would be effective in prevention of human avian influenza. However, there is preliminary evidence given by the SARS experience suggesting such means are potentially useful. Such studies of public health behaviors may be crucial in the control of anticipated human avian influenza outbreaks. The public is vigilant and responsive to the threat of emerging infectious diseases; such was evident in the case of SARS. Anticipation of emerging infectious diseases hence also offers opportunities for the promotion of IV and other public health behaviors related to influenza prevention.",
