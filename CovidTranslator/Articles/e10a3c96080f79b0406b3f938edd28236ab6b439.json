The candidate vaccine elicited strong antigenicity related to the increases of anti-Leishmania IgG isotypes, together with higher levels of lymphocytes, particularly of circulating CD8 + T-lymphocytes and Leishmania chagasi antigen-specific CD8 + T-lymphocytes. As indicated by the intense cell proliferation and increased nitric oxide production during in vitro stimulation by L. chagasi soluble antigens, the candidate vaccine elicited an immune activation status potentially compatible with effective control of the etiological agent of CVL.",

Leishmania (L.) infantum) and represents a major veterinary and public health problem in various regions of the New World and in countries around the Mediterranean basin [1] . In the endemic areas of Brazil, the prevalence of CVL reportedly ranges from 5 to 35% [2] . The dog is the most important domestic reservoir of the etiological agent of the human visceral leishmaniasis, and for this reason the current strategy for managing the disease in man includes the detection and elimination of seropositive dogs alongside vector control and therapy for individual cases [3] . Thus, in the past 5 years the Brazilian Ministry of Health has directed the screening of around two million dogs and the elimination of more than 160,000 seropositive animals, but the incidence of human VL has not been reduced to an acceptable level [4] . These approaches have not been entirely effective, however, partly because of the resistance by dog owners to acquiesce in the euthanasia of their infected pets [5, 6] .",

Although an effective vaccine against human VL is not yet available, much effort has been expended in this area in recent years and several candidate vaccine antigens have been studied extensively in mice [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, results obtained with a vaccine against VL that has been designed and tested using a mouse model cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other species [15] . This situation is well-illustrated by reference to the vaccine developed by Dunan et al. [16] , which was effective in murine models but offered no protection against CVL [17] . Ideally, a vaccine designed to protect dogs should be developed using a canine model.",

            "text": "A recent strategy for the development of a vaccine against leishmaniasis has been based on the use of purified fractions from parasite extracts (FLM antigen) or from parasite cultures (excreted/secreted antigens), and some encouraging results have been reported [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, vaccines prepared from whole parasites antigenic extracts still remain a reliable perspective considering their broad spectrum of antigenicity, cost and safety, and a number of such vaccines have been tested [22, 23] . In phase I and II clinical trials, Mayrink et al. [24] demonstrated enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and significant protection against infection by Leishmania in Brazilian dogs that had received merthiolated, ultrasound-disrupted promastigotes of L. braziliensis together with Bacillus Calmete-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG). Strong cellular proliferation to soluble Leishmania antigens (SLA) has also been reported in dogs vaccinated with autoclaved L. major promastigotes (ALM) plus BCG [25] . Additionally, a vaccine composed of L. infantum promastigotes that had been freeze/thawed and then emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant, induced high parasiticidal activity and increased the formation of nitric oxide (NO) in the macrophages of treated dogs [26] . Moreover, a single dose of a vaccine composed of aluminium hydroxide (alum)precipitated L. major (alum-ALM) plus BCG has been shown to be safe and to decrease the incidence of CVL from 12 to 3.7%, which is equivalent to a 69.3% efficacy rate [27] .",

Canine WBL were selected on the basis of their characteristic forward (FSC) and side (SSC) light-scatter distributions. Following FSC and SSC gain adjustments, the lymphocytes were selected by gating on the FSC versus SSC graph. Fluorescence was evaluated from FITC and PE-Cy5 spectra on FL1 or FL3 single-histogram representations. Monocytes were analysed by fluorescence intensity detection on single histograms obtained directly from ungated leukocytes. For data analysis, a marker was set as an internal control for non-specific binding in order to encompass >98% of unlabelled cells: this marker was then used in all data analysis for a given animal. The results were expressed as the percentage of positive cells within the selected gate for cell surface markers presenting bimodal distribution (CD5, CD4, CD8 and CD21). Semi-quantitative analyses were carried out for the cell surface marker (MHC-I) that exhibited a unimodal distribution in order to evaluate differential expression, and the results were expressed as mean fluorescence channel (MFC) on a log scale. Data were also expressed as absolute counts in order to allow the normalization of values obtained from groups whose overall leukocyte counts were different.

Data were expressed as means of the NO pro-duction index (antigen-stimulated culture/control culture) in order to compare values in culture supernatants prepared at T0 (immediately prior to the application of the first dose of vaccine) and T3 (15 days after the application of the third dose of vaccine).",

For this reason a considerable effort has been dedicated to studies on immune responses in CVL, and several Leishmania antigens implicated in these responses have been reported [14, 15, 41] . There is a major consensus that L. chagasi/infantum antigens display a potent immunosuppressive potential that would be deleterious for the immunoprotection against CVL. Several studies have reported the potential of L. chagasi antigens to trigger immunosuppression by blocking the in vitro lymphoproliferative response to Leishmania antigens as well as the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines by antigenpresenting cells [42, 43] . The use of purified Leishmania donovani and L. infantum antigens has been also proposed to overcome this immunosuppressive effect of L. chagasi antigens [18] [19] [20] . Most studies, including those clinical trials with vaccine candidates to CVL immunoprofilaxis have been conduced using either L. amazonensis, L. braziliensis or L. major antigens. Previous studies from our group have demonstrated that L. braziliensis antigen have a potent role in protecting L. chagasi infection in dogs (unpublished data). Therefore, a critical question for screening and development of anti-leishmanial vaccines in CVL is to define Leishmania antigens and adjuvant systems that elicit a favorable and sustained cytokine environment in vivo.",

Therefore, further studies are still required to overcome this issue by searching for additional safety biomarkers for the use of saponin as vaccine adjuvant. Some side effects that have been reported following the use of saponin adjuvants include some non-specific immune reactions, loss of hair at the site of injection, anorexia, apathy, vomiting and diarrhoea [44] [45] [46] . However, as saponin induces the development of strong CD8 + T-lymphocytes cytotoxicity [47] , its use as adjuvant has been included in several veterinary vaccines [44] .",

Furthermore, IgG1 and IgG2 subtypes have been traditionally used as surrogates of the Th2 and Th1 phenotypes of immune response in mice whereas IgG4 response is more generally related to a Th2 response in humans. However, the association between IgG subtypes and the immune response in terms of the Th1/Th2 phenotype is not so straightforward in dogs [30, [49] [50] [51] [52] , the finding of both immunoglobulin isotypes sug-gested that a mixed immune response is triggered by LBSap vaccination.",

Moreover, positive correlations between CD5 + T-cells and the CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell subset, and between CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells, further suggested significant cooperation at the cellular level as has been observed during early clonal expansion and the generation of primary CD8 + cytotoxic effectors [55] .

The finding of a higher expression of MHC-I in lymphocytes in the LBSap group indicated an improvement in the activation status of lymphocytes during the immunisation protocol. It has been proposed that an increase in the expression of MHC-II may reflect an antigenic primingrelated immunological event [37, 57] . Consistent with this hypothesis, we have demonstrated that dogs with asymptomatic CVL displayed an enhanced activation status of circulating lymphocytes (as determined from MHC-II) [37] , together with lower overall tissue parasitism [30, 37] . However, data from the present study highlight the importance of MHC-I expression as an activation marker in lymphocytes. In fact, the up-regulation of MHC-I and -II are both related to the presence of IFN-\u2425 [58, 59] . Consistent with this hypothesis, the evaluation of APC revealed increased numbers of circulating CD14 + monocytes in the LBSap group that were associated with increased MHC-I expression in lymphocytes. On the basis of these results, it is possible to speculate that this association would represent the interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses, reflecting in improvement in activation status during LBSap immunisation.",

Higher cell reactivities following stimulation by either VSA or SLcA were recorded for the LBSap group after the third immunisation, whereas the stimulation index in the LB group was lower at T3 compared to T0. Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that PBMC proliferation in the LBSap group is associated with the recognition of L. chagasi antigen, and suggest that this vaccine may be of value against the etiological agent of VL.",

In contrast, a negative association between CD21 + B-cells and cell proliferation was observed in the presence of VSA, and a positive association upon SLcA stimulation. These findings indicate a distinct profile of APC in the cultures and establish that CD14 + monocytes and CD21 + B-cells are the major APC, respectively, during in vitro stimulation with VSA and SLcA.",

In contrast, no differences were observed in the frequency of CD5 + T-cells following in vitro stimulation, whilst reductions in the frequency of CD4 + T-cells and increases in the level of CD8 + T-cells were associated with SLcA stimulus. These results support the hypothesis that CD8 + T-cells play a protective role in the mechanism of control of Leishmania parasitism. Additional correlation analysis revealed that both CD4 + and CD8 + Tcells exhibited positive associations with cell proliferation in vitro following stimulation with VSA or SLcA. These data suggest the possibility of stimulating antigen-specific T-cell subsets following LBSap immunisation that could contribute to improvements in the cellular immune response during L. chagasi infection.",

Such a strategy for vaccine design is attractive in terms of safety and stability of product compared with purified subunit preparations or DNA vaccines, both of which involve more sophisticated technology that may not be readily available in developing countries. Furthermore, in contrast to recombinant vaccines, killed vaccines require fewer tests to be carried out on the bulk intermediates and finished products, and this makes the cost of production lower than for recombinant proteins [60] . Additionally, killed vaccines present a great diversity in antigenic repertoire, and this should potentially activate a stronger cellular response, mainly by T-lymphocytes, compared with that of purified subunit preparations or DNA vaccines.",
