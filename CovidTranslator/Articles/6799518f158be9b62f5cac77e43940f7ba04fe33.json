Conservation genetics, ecol-ogy, and habitat management together provide the technical underpinnings of conservation biology, a crisisoriented science of biodiversity management. Still in its infancy, conservation genetics focuses on the characterization of variation in populations and species and on the management of innate levels of variation in evolutionarily significant units in nature and in their captive or managed analogs. Conservation genetic methods are borrowed from evolutionary biology and molecular genetics and are under development. Although some genetic management principles flow directly from current evolutionary theory, several key scientific problems remain to be solved before we can effectively deal with the issues presented by the biodiversity crisis. Although single-species ecological methods have dominated conservation management practice, it is clear that maintaining the future evolvability of species will require greater genetic intervention in the future. Conservation genetics is thus a cornerstone of biodiversity conservation.",

            "text": "Until the 1960s, it was widely thought that genetic variation was unusual. Biologists regarded populations as being composed of many very similar ''wild-type'' individuals and a few rare mutant individuals. Following the introduction of allozyme electrophoresis it quickly became clear that most plant and animal populations were highly variable. Subsequently, it has become possible to examine DNA sequences directly and large numbers of base pair mutations have been discovered in functional genes of most living organisms studied. Even higher levels of variation occur in the introns and highly repetitive stretches of noncoding ''junk DNA'' that lie between eukaryote genes. High levels of variability characterize most natural populations of plants and animals and this variability is thought to be both a product of evolutionary agents and a determinant of the future evolvability of a population. Genetics became a cornerstone of conservation science in 1981 with the publication of Frankel and Soul\u00e9's Conservation and Evolution. Since then, geneticists have studied the effects of the ongoing global reduction of genetic variability on population viability and species persistence.

            "text": "Estimates of variability in a population vary with the feature examined and analytical method used. Karyotypic variation is usually low within a species, allozyme variation is high, and DNA sequence variation may be very high in some parts of the genome. The principle of high natural variability is perhaps best illustrated by the published surveys of allozyme patterns in plants and animals (Schonewald-Cox et al., 1983) . Geneticists typically sample a population of 20 individuals and determine each individual's genotype at 10-20 loci. This allows them to calculate the mean number of alleles per locus (A), the mean individual heterozygosity (H), and the proportion of loci in the population that are polymorphic (P). A few thousand species have been examined to date and variation is typically in the following range: H \u03ed 0.05-0.15 and P \u03ed 0.20-0.50. Still higher levels of natural variation are found at the DNA sequence level, especially in areas of the genome which are apparently free to mutate. Short repeat sequences (microsatellites) of nuclear DNA, for example, are often 10 times more variable than allozyme loci. A polymorphic allozyme may have 2 or 3 alleles segregating in a population, whereas a dinucleotide repeat microsatellite may have 10-15 alleles (differing in the number of times the motif is repeated) in the same individuals. Biochemical and molecular genetics have shown that most living organisms are richly variable.",

            "text": "Much of the cryptic variation in natural populations that has been discovered in the past 30 years appears to be selectively neutral or near neutral in its effect on the phenotype. That is, the individuals carrying these various allelic variants appear perfectly healthy. It is rare to find a single locus genetic trait in which a deleterious condition such as albinism is controlled by a single allelic variant. In fact, there is strong circumstantial evidence that much of this genetic variation is actually beneficial. Although the relationship between genetic variability and individual fitness is not well understood, it is clear that variability is associated with viability. Experiments and field observations with a few species have shown that there is a positive relationship between genetic variability and individual growth rate, size at maturity, symmetry of body parts, fecundity, and health as measured by parasite load. Extrapolating from the individual level to the population level, it is a fundamental maxim of evolutionary biology that genetic variation is positively related to adaptability or evolvability. Fisher's fundamental theorem holds that additive genetic variation in fitness is positively related to a population's ability to respond to natural selection. Evolutionary success, the ability of a species to persist despite changes in climate and exposure to new diseases, predators, and competitors, is somehow related to innate genetic variability. In a world of unpredictable change, alleles that are selectively neutral for thousands of generations may suddenly become lifesavers for the individuals that carry them. If evolution is largely dependent on genetic variability, then the conservation of species will sooner or later depend on the conservation of their innate genetic variability (Woodruff, 1989) .",

Benirschke and Kumamoto (1991) and Smith and Wayne (1996) provide numerous examples of the application of karyotypes and molecular genetic markers, respectively, to conservation. The various methods differ in their resolution of pedigree, population, and species-level questions and there is no single correct technique. One method, allozyme electrophoresis, is informative with mammals but frustratingly uninformative for birds. The methods also differ greatly in their cost and technical difficulty. Some relatively inexpensive methods are satisfactory for one-time analyses but the results cannot be built on in subsequent studies. Other methods, in contrast, provide genotypes which can be archived in expandable permanent databases such as GenBank for future comparative study of samples collected at other times or places.

These metrics and their interpretations are beyond the scope of this review, but it is important to note that the absolute values of genetic distances will vary between different groups of plants and animals and increase over geological time.

            "text": "Although the previous discussion focused on molecular genetic variation, the growing field of quantitative trait genetics promises to provide a new means of measuring evolutionarily significant population variables (Storfer, 1996) . Quantitative genetics is concerned with characters such as morphology, behavior, parasite resistance, and physiology that are controlled by several to many genes that work additively, in dominance/recessive relationships, or epistatically. Such oligogenic and polygenic control, involving quantitative trait loci (QTL), is characteristic of many traits of interest to conservationists-those that effect long-term population persistence and evolvability. QTLs affecting body size, hatching date, and predator avoidance behavior (escape speed), for example, are ecologically important and are arguably of greater significance to conservationists than allozyme polymorphism. Conservationists are therefore interested in the heritability of such traits that have a direct impact on fitness. High heritabilities of a QTL indicate that a population has great potential for trait evolution and low heritabilities indicate a more limited ability to respond to environmental change. Unfortunately, such heritability is difficult to measure because it requires pedigree-level studies conducted over several generations or long-term manipulative experiments such as controlled garden plots. Heritability (h 2 ) is the ratio of the variance of the genetically inherited proportion of a trait (the additive genetic variance, V A ) to the total phenotypic variance V P measured in the population. V A is one component of genetic variance (V G ) which also includes nonadditive genetic variance due to dominance (V D ) and epistasis (V I ); only V A responds to directional selection. Estimating V A is further complicated by the need to estimate variance due to the environment (V E ) as well as the other genetic components. Nevertheless, the preparation of studbooks for captive populations of endangered animals and the comparison of laboratory-raised seedlings of rare plants to their parents in the wild have provided opportunities for the first limited applications of QTL analyses to conservation. Future technical advances may permit the inclusion of QTL in the conservation geneticist's tool kit of predictors of a population's risk of extinction.",

Although this argument is reasonable, the maintenance of desirable rare alleles, even if they were identifiable, requires very large population sizes (N e \u03fe 5000) and is simply not possible in most management programs. Rare alleles contribute very little to variation in fitness among individuals and are less likely than alleles at relatively high frequency to be the basis of adaptive response to environmental change.",

Early models considered demography (growth rate, present population size, and birth rate) and environmental stochasticity, but Gilpin and Soul\u00e9 (1986) broadened the definition to include genetic factors. Genetic factors, including genetic drift and fixation of deleterious mutations, are expressed through demographic factors that affect population dynamics. The genetic factors thus contribute to extinction probabilities through a very complex and little understood series of interactions affecting fitness. Geneticists can use population variation to provide estimates of the various parameters of interest to modelers and managers. Unfortunately, genetic models with linkages to ecological factors are still insufficiently developed to yield the type of statistically powerful PVAs managers seek. Most PVAs, in fact, have not included genetic parameters, but this is changing as the significance of genetics in the long-term survival of small populations becomes more widely appreciated (Beissinger and McCullough, 2000) .",

The metapopulation concept is central to much ecology and conservation theory and singleand multiple-species metapopulation dynamics are reviewed by Hanski and Gilpin (1996) . The genetic effective size of a metapopulation is affected by the carrying capacity of the habitat patches, the rates of extirpation and recolonization, the number and source of the founders, the number of local populations, and the rate of gene flow between patches. It is difficult to establish metapopulation effective size using genetic data because it is strongly affected by extirpation and recolonization dynamics. As in the case of genetic effective population size of single populations, the metapopulation effective size is 10-100 times less than the census size in many species. Metapopulation dynamics, with frequent local extinction and recolonization of habitat patches by few founders, can reduce N e to a small fraction of N, with a resulting loss of genetic variability like that associated with a demographic bottleneck. Detailed studies of metapopulations are reviewed by Hanski and Gilpin (1997) and include the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) and the red bladder campion (Silene dioica), both in Sweden; the checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha) restricted to serpentine outcrops in California; and the pikas (Ochotona principes), a small mammal restricted to isolated talus slopes in alpine areas.

The observation of significant hybridization without introgression, in the latter cases, led to the development of the semispecies concept which is of relevance to conservation. Semispecies are typically parapatrically distributed and hybridize where their ranges meet, but they show very limited introgression. They are effectively isolated groups of populations evolving independently of one another. Collectively, a group of semispecies comprise a superspecies and each semispecies is treated taxonomically as a full species.

Although some of these have limited operational utility, three newer biological species concepts are of particular relevance to conservation geneticists: Wiley's evolutionary species concept, Templeton's cohesion species concept, and Mallet's genetic cluster species concept. All seek to recognize discrete groups of populations with a shared evolutionary future.

It is possible to estimate genetic distances between groups of populations and gauge their significance in comparison to within-population variation. It is possible to estimate the time since a speciation event and the historical patterns of gene flow within and between taxa.

Matings between father and daughter, brother and sister, or first cousins are examples of inbreeding. Many species of plants and animals have evolved devices to minimize close inbreeding. Species vary greatly in their tolerance of inbreeding; some trees and dioecious plants are obligate outcrossers. The genetic underpinnings of inbreeding depression are best understood in Drosophila, in which recessive lethal mutations and mildly deleterious mutations are major causes. Gradual inbreeding permits natural selection to purge the former but the partially recessive near-neutral mutations continue to increase in frequency and significance. Outcrossing populations that suddenly decline in numbers usually experience reduced viability and fecundity known as inbreeding depression. Inbreeding produces increased homozygosity of recessive partially deleterious mutants and by chance in small populations these alleles become fixed. In the simplest genetic situation of a trait under the control of a lethal recessive allele, there is an increased risk that the offspring of two related healthy but heterozygous individuals will inherit the harmful allele from each parent and die. Although the risk in this case is only one in four, this amounts to a powerfully strong fitness differential on which natural selection will act. Generalizing from this simplest single-locus case, geneticists speak of inbreeding depression as the manifestation of the whole genomic effects of mating of close relatives. These effects may involve outright genetic disease (congenital abnormalities) but are more often subtle and appear as decreased growth rate, behavioral abnormalities, and reduced fertility and fecundity. Therefore, inbreeding is rare in typically outbreeding populations but becomes a serious problem in small isolated populations. In small fragmented populations in nature and in captive populations, inbreeding depression can threaten population viability. Animal breeders learned these lessons from centuries of experience with artificial selection, and they limit inbreeding rates to less than 2% per generation. The consequences of very close inbreeding are well illustrated by experience with establishing ''inbred'' strains of laboratory mice; the majority of inbred lines die out within 10 generations.",

Ralls (in Schonewald-Cox et al., 1983, pp. 164-184) was the first to show that even well-intended captive breeding programs subjected small populations to inbreeding depression. She reviewed empirical records for 40 species, mainly ungulates, in zoos and found in-breeding to be a problem in most cases. Inbreeding is also associated with decreased growth rate and blindness in a captive wolf population in Sweden. In the wild, the final decline of the heath hen (Tympanuchus cupido) on Martha's Vineyard island in 1932 involved inbreeding effects. Other better documented cases (Hedrick in Smith and Wayne, 1996, pp. 459-477; Lacy, 1997) involving declining or threatened wild populations involve the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius) in Sweden, the Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi), Barrow Island populations of the black-footed rock wallaby (Petrogale lateralis), common shrews (Sorex ananeus) in England, deer mice (Peromyscus polionotus), and Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in the Aland Islands, Finland (Saccheri et al., 1998) .",

It involves the active or passive movement of individual plants, animals, gametes, or seeds. Gene flow involves not just dispersal but also the successful establishment of the immigrant genotypes in the new population. Gene flow is often confusingly referred to as migration, but the latter term is best reserved to describe dispersal behaviors involving a seasonal or longer term round-trip. Gene flow tends to homogenize linked populations and lack of gene flow permits interpopulation differentiation. It is of interest to geneticists and managers in that to conserve a population one needs to establish the historical patterns and rates of gene flow. This is typically estimated from allele frequency data and reported in terms of the number of ''migrants'' per generation. In theory, one migrant per generation between two populations will ensure that they remain genetically homogeneous. Inbreeding depression can be ameliorated by the artificial translocation of one reproducing migrant per generation between populations. Gene flow is often gender biased and limited to certain phases of the life cycle. It may be accelerated under certain climatic conditions that occur at frequencies of many years or at irregular intervals many years apart. Interspecific gene flow results in introgressive hybridization (discussed previously). The translocation of individual organisms results in gene flow if they reproduce at the release site. In the future, genetically depauperate populations will be enhanced by transloca-tion of individuals from more secure areas. Unfortunately, such genetic enhancement carries risks associated with the introduction of pathogens that could harm the target population or completely unrelated species. Furthermore, the introduction of individuals from genetically well-differentiated source populations may result in outbreeding depression in the threatened population of conservation concern (discussed previously). Gene flow can thus erode the genetic basis of adaptation to local conditions. If previously continuous populations become fragmented, historical patterns of dispersal and gene flow may be disrupted with potentially serious consequences for population viability. For example, if young female chimpanzees can no longer emigrate from their natal social group because of habitat destruction in the surrounding countryside, their isolated natal population will experience increased inbreeding.",

Sewall Wright (1969) developed the basic theoretical model in 1931 and showed analytically how the rate varies with population size. Actually, it is not the census size (N) that is important but rather the genetic effective population size (N e ). This parameter takes into account the fact that closely related individuals will share alleles by common descent. Monozygotic twins are genetically identical and therefore should be counted as one individual rather than two. Sibs share half their genes with each other and half with each of their parents and are therefore not equivalent to two genetically unrelated individuals. The genetic effective number of individuals in a population is therefore almost always less than the number of individuals counted by an ecologist. N e can, under some breeding systems, be one or two orders of magnitude less than N. Consider, for example, the number of adults in a sexually reproducing population: In a monogamous species the census count of adults is useful, but in a harem species only 1 of the 10 males may be contributing to N e . N e can be variously defined in terms of unequal sex ratios among breeders, fluctuations in population size over several generations, and variance in family size (Lande and Barrowclough, 1987) . Wright (1969) defined the variance effective population size (N e ) as the number of individuals in an ideal population that would experience genetic drift at the same rate as the actual population. N e can be defined and estimated in various ways using temporal ecological data, DNA sequences, and various methods of estimating migration rate. Some methods of estimation have theoretical value but little operational utility-it is almost impossible to determine the values that some algorithms require. Nevertheless, by estimating N e one can assess the effects of different population management strategies. Unequal numbers of males and females, increased variance in family size, and temporal fluctuations in N all cause N e to be much less than the census size, N. In many endangered populations N e is only 10-30, and at such levels genetic variation becomes significant for a population's viability.",

However, large populations that are almost isogenic at such loci may maintain high heritable variance in QTL, low inbreeding depression, and high heterozygosity for simple repetitive microsatellite DNA because variation at QTL may return to outbred levels in 10 3 to 10 4 generations.

Drift may account for the very low levels of variability observed in African cheetahs and northern elephant seals.

Population genetic theory shows that variation will be lost by genetic drift with an almost clocklike regularity (Wright, 1969) . In closed populations, in the absence of factors promoting genetic variation (mutation and gene flow) the expected rate of loss of heterozygosity, or rate of loss of genetic variance in quantitative characters or selectively neutral variation, is 1/2N e per generation. Little variation is lost in any one generation but small N sustained for several generations can severely deplete variability. Most variability is lost within 2N e generations. An effective population of 10 is predicted to lose heterozygotes five times faster than a population of effective size 100; 50% of its heterozygosity will be lost in approximately 20 generations. Therefore, in theory, small isolated populations have a higher rate of loss of heterozygosity and are expected to have lower levels of genetic variation than large continuously distributed populations. Because variability is inherently related to evolvability, genetic erosion in small, recently fragmented populations may contribute to their endangerment. Barrett and Kohn (1991) and Young et al. (1996) review the growing literature of the population genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation for plants. There are numerous examples of a positive relationship between N e and population genetic variation at allozyme loci for remnant populations. Ouberg and colleagues conducted experimental investigations of genetic erosion with Scabiosa columbaria and Salvia pratensis plants under common garden conditions and found positive correlations between variance for adaptive traits related to growth rates and population size. Recently, others studied Clarkia pulchella and found an increased probability of extinction associated with decreased N e . Such experimental studies indicate the potential significance of genetic erosion in natural populations.",

An opportunity to study genetic erosion empirically arose when 165 km 2 of lowland rain forest were flooded in 1987 following construction of a hydroelectric dam on Khlong Saeng, southern Thailand. Former hilltops became permanent islands in Chiew Larn reservoir and retained their original fauna of 12 species of small mammals. During years 5-8 postfragmentation, the demographic collapse of these communities and genetic erosion in three common species [a forest rat (Maxomys surifer), a tree mouse (Chiropodomys gliroides), and a tree shrew (Tupia glis)] whose populations were effectively isolated on some islands were monitored. Nuclear microsatellite markers are sufficiently variable to be used to monitor the process of genetic erosion in nature. As expected, small populations lost variability by genetic drift faster than large populations, and allelic variability is a better indicator of the onset of genetic erosion than heterozygosity.

It is of interest to conservation geneticists for two reasons. First, human activities can radically alter selection coefficients in both natural populations and managed ones. Such humaninfluenced evolutionary change is termed artificial selection whether or not it is intentional. Intense harvesting based on size or gender can cause rapid changes in behavior and natural history and reduce fitness. Examples include reduced body size in game fish and the impact of hunting only male horned or tusked mammals on social behavior. Second, one of the major challenges facing geneticists this century will be assisting species to adapt to ongoing global climatic changes. In the past, in the absence of humans, natural selection favored individuals adapted to change and many species shifted their ranges to accommodate major changes. Unfortunately, in the twenty-first century, the pace of environmental alteration and destruction is too fast for many species to respond. Conservation managers will have to intervene on behalf of many species if they are to survive.",

Preferential interpod mating in long-finned pilot whales indicates the importance of conserving as many pods as possible. Genetics shows that highly gregarious black vultures (Coragyps atratus) are in fact monogamous and that Galapagos hawks (Buteo galapagoensis) are polyandrous. Despite behavioral observations suggesting a high frequency of matings between sibs in Australian splendid fairy wrens (Malurus splendens), genetics shows that outcrossing is the norm. In other birds, including stripe-backed wrens (Campylorhynchus nuchalis), geneticists found that subordinate males reproduce. The mating system of wild gray wolf, chimpanzees, and other species have been established and used to improve captive breeding programs or management in reserves. Establishing the mating system of the red-cockaded woodpecker led to improved estimates of N e and changes in the recovery program for a small population in South Carolina.",

Consider the conservation management of salmon (Oncorhynchus) in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Salmon with their precise homing behavior present a major problem because each local spawning population should be managed as a genetically distinct taxon. Should managers give every natal stream-adapted salmon stock equal priority? Geneticists have developed allelic frequency marker systems for stock identification that are sufficiently sensitive to permit real-time regulation of mixed stock fisheries involving both hatchery and wild salmon. The latter can be partially protected because they return from the sea to the rivers a few weeks later than the former and the fishery can be terminated when they are detected.",

For example, using laboratory populations of Drosophila it has been shown that equalizing family size can double N e and more intensive pedigree management can increase the N e /N ratio 40-fold. Similarly, in most of the examples dis-cussed previously, investigators also examined the genetics of a close relative of the taxon of interest. It is standard practice to develop genetic methods using a common relative as a surrogate before commencing work on a highly endangered taxon. This approach also has the advantage of providing comparative data useful in interpreting the results of a study of an endangered taxon.",

There are on the order of 10 million species living on the planet today and about 2 million of these are recognized and named in a formal taxonomic sense. Describing a new species requires little more than that a scientist know what it looks like and where it is found; unfortunately, this constitutes our state of knowledge for most of biodiversity. Closer to 10 4 than to 10 5 species have been characterized ecobehaviorally, and only on the order of 10 3 species have been examined by geneticists. If sound conservation is based on a knowledge of ecology, behavior, and genetics, then we must admit that we are currently capable of scientifically managing the evolution of less than 1000 species. However, the number of species requiring individual management to prevent their extinction in the next 100 years is in excess of 10,000. Conservation geneticists have devoted their efforts disproportionately toward the charismatic megavertebrates. Whales and cats have received more attention than bats and rats. Given the enormous number of species requiring attention, one might inquire as to how priorities are set. First, most research has gone into species that were favored for utilitarian reasons; they provide us with food, clothing, medicines, recreation, or companionship. Most of this research has been aimed at stock improvement rather than whole genome or species conservation. Second, as already noted, the charismatic megavertebrates and a few groups of flowering plants have received inordinate attention. Perhaps not surprisingly, rare species have also been studied more than common ones. The same applies to phylogenetically unique species, living fossils, and evolutionary relics. However, because the real goal is to save functional ecosystems, conservation geneticists are rethinking their priorities. Although some rare species clearly merit genetic management, it would be better to focus more attention on ecological keystone species whose activities are critical to the maintenance of entire communities. We also need to know more about the genetics of ecologically successful colonizing species and of clades of species that have evolved very recently (the cichlid flocks of Rift Valley lakes) because their study may teach us how to manage apparently less successful taxa.",

Species are typically better managed in their natural communities than in isolation. Existing institutions concerned with conservation, however, are not equipped to deal with the magnitude of the task they face (Woodruff, 1989) . Parks and wildlife reserves are the preferred approach to both species and community conservation. Zoos and botanic gardens are extremely limited in what they can accomplish and can at best serve only to shelter a few critical cases that require intensive care. Germplasm frozen storage systems are valuable adjuncts for researchers, but no credible geneticist has yet proposed that we will be able to awaken these frozen tissues and recreate the animals from which they were derived. Although frozen tissue banks are extremely valuable for geneticists, the revitalization of mammoths, quaggas, thylocenes, and dodos is still science fiction.",

It was argued that demography and behavior are far more important than genetics in saving endangered species. Others have argued that the genetic threat to population viability has been overstated (Lande, 1988) . Genetics was viewed as too theoretical and contributing too little and too slowly to the day-to-day efforts to save populations in nature. Furthermore, molecular genetics studies, which are relatively expensive, compete for the limited funds available to the traditional conservationists. Some of the criticisms were justified and some were not. It is easy to disparage the potential contribution of genetics to saving a particular population or species if genetics is defined very narrowly as, for example, the determination of heterozygosity in a remnant population. In the case of cheetahs in Africa, it is clear that predation by lions and humans is more significant today than low variability. Similarly, in captivity, different husbandry practices in different zoos are more significant than poor sperm quality. However, if one takes a longer term view, the answer is different: Genetics is and will be increasingly important. As this review shows, geneticists have a great deal to offer managers. It is incorrect to suggest that ecology and genetics are alternative approaches. Although there are clearly times when genetic studies will be lower priority in a multifaceted conservation strategy, it is undeniable that increasingly more populations will need genetic management. Genetics, ecology, and behavior are all necessary parts of biodiversity conservation.",

The ultimate goal of conservation biology is to preserve the processes of organic evolution-to maintain the ability of populations and species to evolve and communities to function and provide ecosystem services. The basic science is still not equal to the task conservation geneticists are expected to perform. The relationship between genetic variation and ''genetic health'' is illusive and needs clarification. Society's expectations of conservation geneticists also need to be specified or we will forever be accused of treating the symptoms and not the causes of the biodiversity crisis. Typically, species are not afforded legal protection until their populations have fallen into the hundreds, 10-100 times below the level at which their genetic integrity and viability are reasonably secure. Geneticists need to point out that current standards of endangerment are far too low, that recovery from previous mass extinctions took on the order of 10 million years, and that we have not thought through the global implications of a 50% decrease in the number of remaining larger plant and vertebrate species (Myers, 1996) .
