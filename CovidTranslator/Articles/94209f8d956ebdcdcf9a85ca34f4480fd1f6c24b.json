Regions of crossover in 42 FMDV recombinants Virus Res 3: 373-384; Saunders et al. (1985) J Virol 56: 921-929] and regions lacking crossovers were assigned an average secondary structure score against which the number of observed recombinants was plotted. In general it was found that the mean value of potential secondary structure is significantly higher in crossover zones than in recombination-free zones. Recombination increased much more steeply with increasing secondary structure in the part of the genome coding for non-structural proteins than in the 5' third of the genome coding for structural proteins.",

            "text": "In theory there are two ways in which RNA can recombine, either by a break-rejoin mechanism as occurs during splicing of cellular and viral messenger RNAs [30] and in self-splicing reactions [3, 33, 34] or by a copy-choice mechanism where the RNA polymerase terminates prematurely and \"jumps\" to another site where it reinitiates replication. Kirkegaard and Baltimore [ 15] have recently provided strong evidence for a copy-choice mechanisin in poliovirus recombination. Romanova et al. [27] have suggested that recombination occurs at higher frequency in regions of higher secondary structure. They proposed that such regions help to bring together homologous regions of two recombining genomes via formation of intermolecular duplexes enabling the migrating polymerase to \"jump\" onto the nucleotide chain of the second molecule. Transiently formed secondary structures have also been implicated in DI RNA formation where a nucleotide sequence complementary to sequences adjacent to the 5' and 3' ends of the deleted portion could hold together sequences long enough for the RNA polymerase to \"jump\" (\"supporting sequence loop model\") [17] . The mechanism of the formation of poliovirus recombinants might also be related to rearrangement events in viroids [11] but can be distinguished from the splicing events mentioned above [30] and also from priming of viral mRNA synthesis by heterologous and heterogeneous mRNA molecules [16, 24] .",

As this virus has a genome structure similar to potiovirus and also shares other characteristics, a copy-choice mechanism of recombination should be considered. The nucleotide sequence of 94 percent of the genomic RNA of FMDV has been determined by Forss et al. [7] ; this sequence spans the RNA between the 5' proximal poly (C) tract and the 3' terminal poly (A) tail. FMDV recombinants have been extensively characterized since Pringle's [25] original observation, and McCahon's group has recently mapped the crossover sites of 17 classes of FMDV recombinants using biochemical techniques [14, 21, 22, 29] . In their analysis of oligonucleotides of recombinants Saunders et al. [29] used the numbering system of Forss et at. [7] , and we have maintained it for determining the boundaries of zones in which recombination events had been observed. Although there were crossover sites found virtually in all parts of the genome they did not seem to be evenly distributed and while this may be an artifact due to the selection systems used to isolate the recombinants, it was tempting to hypothesize that--as in the collection ofpotiovirus recombinants of Romanova et al. [27] and more recently of Tolskaya et al. [32] --there might be \"hotspots\" and \"coldspots\" of recombination which could possibly correspond to regions of high and low secondary structure, respectively.",

            "text": "As the recombination zones analysed [14, 21, 29] are of different size, new programs were written to sum directly all secondary structure scores above a Total secondary structure scores per interval were obtained by adding together all percentage matches above 62 percent occurring in the zones of length indicated by nucleotide interval along the diagonal, and of 50 nucleotides width to each side. In Column 5 the ratios of total secondary structure score over number of nucleotides are given. The frequencies of crossover events in different areas of the genome which are summarized in Table 1 of King et al. [14] and defined in more detail by Saunders et al. [29] are indicated in Column 6. Zones of crossovers in the different classes were defined by oligonucleotide mapping data of Saunders et al. [29] and by protein analyses and were between 500 and 1,400 nucleotides long (Column 3). As the oligonucleotides were numbered by Saunders et at. [29] using the numbering system of Forss et al. [7] , Table 1 . F r o m this in general it can be deduced that lack of crossover sites correlates with a low secondary structure score per nucleotide in the zone (0.30 to 2.87) whereas the average secondary structure score per nucleotide is between 2.71 and 6.04 in recombination zones. In order to investigate whether or not there is a quantifiable relationship between the secondary structure score per nucleotide and the n u m b e r of crossovers per zone, the values were plotted against each other as shown in Fig. 2 . Table 1 it is obvious that there are many more recombinants mapping in the 3' two thirds of the genome (N = 36) than there are recombinants mapping to the 5' third (N = 6) in spite of a high secondary structure score per nucleotide in the two recombination zones nearest the 5' end. It occurred to us that there may be more constraints for recombination in the part of the genome coding for the structural proteins (nucleotide positions 1,365-3,524) [7] . Therefore we performed linear regression analysis separately for paired values of zones 1-5 (nucleotides 1-3,700) and 6-10 (nucleotides 3,701-7,804). The correlation coefficients for the two groups of paired values were 0.921 and 0.833, respectively, being significant for P < 0.02 and P <0.07. Thus the linear regression line for the 3' end recombination zone is of borderline significance, only. However, the mean value of potential secondary structure per nucleotide is significantly higher in crossover zones than in recombinationfree zones of both groups [crossover zones of 5' end group: 5.844-0.20 ( N = 2), recombination-free zones of 5' end group: 2.23 4-0.52 (N = 3), different (t-test) for P < 0.001 ; crossover zones of 3' end group: 4.15 4-1.11 (N = 3), recombination-free zones of 3' end group; 1.154-0.86 ( N = 2 ) , different (t-test) for P<0.05]. The slopes of the two straight lines (Fig. 2) were 0.811 and 2.940, respectively, indicating that recombination in the part of the genome coding for non-structural proteins (nucleotides 3,525-7,709) [7] increased much more steeply with potential secondary structure of a zone. This foregoing analysis was hampered by the fact that the number of isolated recombinants was limited (N = 42) and that the limits of crossover sites were very large in some cases. It remains to be seen whether or not the results of this analysis hold when more precise and more extensive data become available.",

[6] have provided evidence that there is good agreement between secondary structure of psoralen-crosslinked plus strand RNA of poliovirus as visualized by electron microscopy and computer-predicted maps of secondary structure. The copy choice mechanism as developed by Romanova et al. [27] requires that the RNA polymerase will pause, probably at regions of high secondary structure, and that this will free the enzyme to which the nascent RNA is attached. The in vitro products of poliovirus polymerase include a ladder of free \"strong-stop\" molecules whose 3' ends may correspond to regions of high secondary structure [8] . Similarly, in coronavirus-infected cells free nascent RNAs have been detected the 3' ends of which correspond to the regions predicted to be of higher secondary structure [1, t9] . Thus, in order to construct a model for RNA recombination using the copy-choice mechanism, the proximity of the parental genomes is not a necessary prerequisite. Kirkegaard and Baltimore [15] conclude from their data that poliovirus RNA recombination results from a template switch of the viral polymerase during negative strand synthesis, i.e. early in infection, and that it is not particularly site specific within a small range of 190 nucleotides: \"The apparent preference of the polioviral replicase to switch templates during negative strand rather than positive strand synthesis results from different structures or availabilities of the templates for negative and positive strand synthesis during replication\" [15] . For FMDV it has also been found that recombination events between strains occur early in infection [23] .",

The significance of such events for the emergence of new, possibly pathogenic strains remains to be investigated.",
