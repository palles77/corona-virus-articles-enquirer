Here we reported that, under the control of ie1 promoter from white spot syndrome virus, hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H5N1 influenza virus could be efficiently expressed in both insect and mammalian cells mediated by recombinant baculovirus vectors. The HA protein, partially cleaved as in H5N1 virus, was significantly displayed on the surface of baculovirus and conferred the viral particle hemagglutination activity. Intramuscular injection of the purified HA-dispalying baculovirus into mice stimulated the production of antibodies with Hemagglutination inhibition and neutralization activities against tested influenza virus. These data suggested an alternative way to apply baculovirus as an immunizing reagent against influenza virus infection.",

            "text": "In contrast to other commonly used viral vectors, infection of mammalian cells with baculovirus did not result in a visible cytopathic effect (CPE) due to its non-replication nature in these cells. The baculovirus vector was also shown to be capable of carrying large size inserts or multiple gene expression cassettes. Baculovirus, carrying target genes under the control of an appropriate mammalian cell-active promoter, has provided an alternative and attractive choice for gene delivery due to its safety and improved efficacy through genetic engineering [1] . Baculovirus pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) emerges as a promising gene-delivery vector due to its efficiency in transducing numerous mammalian cells and resistance to inactivation by animal sera [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In documented efforts to probe the potential of bac-ulovirus as immunizing reagent, the tested antigen genes were all under the control of mammalian promoters that were not active in insect cells, and the immunogen would only be produced after in vivo transduction [8] [9] [10] [11] . A baculovirus, which harbors the antigenic peptide as a structural protein and sustains the ability to express its gene through in vivo transduction, will present an alternative, if not better, choice for vaccination purpose, since it can trigger immediate immune response upon injection.",

These data suggested that baculovirus vector could display HA-like viral glycoproteins, with similar post-translational modification to their natural products. Western blot assay using anti-VSV G monoclonal antibody also indicate that, as expected, VSV G was membrane associated structural component in purified vAc-G-HA virions (Fig. 2B) . To determine whether the baculovirus surface-displayed HA protein sustained authentic biological property, we tested the hemagglutination activity of purified virions of vAc-HA and vAc-G-HA (Fig. 2C) . Every 25 ll of vAc-HA or vAc-G-HA at a titer of 10 10 PFU/ml gave a hemagglutination titer of around 2 8 in the standard hemagglutination assay [21] .

Both vAc-G-HA and vAc-HA induced serum HI antibody responses in the immunized mice, with a titer of 2 6 (Fig. 3B) . The HI titers of baculovirus vectors were comparable to those mice vaccinated with the vaccine strain H5N1/PR8 that has an average titer of 2 8 (Fig. 3B) . The vaccine strain demonstrated a similar HI titer as the H5 influenza virus that was reported by Takada et al. [15] . In the ELISA test, antibody response induced by vAc-G-HA was around 18% higher than that of vAc-HA, which is in consistence with other reports that VSV G-containing baculovirus might have advantage in transducing foreign gene in vivo. Surprisingly, the H5N1/PR8 vaccine strain induced higher level of antibody response as shown by the ELISA; accordingly the induced anti-sera demonstrated four fold of HI activity higher than the HA-displaying baculoviruses ( Fig. 3A and B). The specific and significant antibody response from the baculovirus-vaccinated mice indicated that, the HA molecule displayed on the viral surface or expressed through viral transduction sustained its authentic antigenicity, although the baculovirus might be less immunogenic than the influenza virus as suggested in our test.
