We investigated the etiology of a cluster of NEC in a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit and monitored for new cases following the implementation of enhanced infection control measures. Methods: Investigators performed a chart and laboratory review for neonates with a diagnosis of NEC during , to identify risk factors. Enhanced environmental cleaning, cohorting of infants and nurses, and increased attention to hand hygiene were instituted. Commercial feeding products in the unit were tested for bacterial contamination. Close monitoring for new cases continued for 2 months following the identification of the cluster. Results: Eleven cases of NEC were identified during the study period. Patients had a median of 5 disease risk factors (range, 3-8). Four distinct pathogens were detected in blood or stool specimens from 4 different patients. One sample of human milk fortifier (HMF) tested contained a colony count of Bacillus cereus at the US Food and Drug Administration's upper microbiologic limit for contamination. Seven (65%) patients received HMF before symptom onset, and 9 (82%) patients received 1 or more types of liquid formula. Only 1 new case was identified during the period of close monitoring. Conclusion: A microbiologic cause was not identified, and, although the cluster might have resolved spontaneously, enhanced infection control and changing batches of HMF might have played a role in controlling this outbreak.",

            "text": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most common serious gastrointestinal diseases among newborns 1 and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among preterm infants. 2 Incidence of NEC nationally in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) has ranged from 1 per 100 infants to 5 per 100 infants, 3, 4 and the case fatality rate has been estimated to range from 10% to 30%. 5 Although the pathogenesis is not understood, it is likely multifactorial (eg, prematurity, aggressive feeding regimens, infection, and inflammation). 2, 3 Neonates experiencing NEC typically present with intestinal symptoms (including feeding intolerance, bloody stool, and abdominal distention), systemic symptoms (including apnea, bradycardia, temperature instability, and septic shock), and characteristic radiographic findings of pneumatosis intestinalis. Limited progress has been achieved in delineating the etiology of NEC because both older 3 and recent 2 articles have described its enigmatic etiology. The majority of cases is sporadic; however, the occurrence of clusters indicates an infectious component to the disease. 1 Multiple causative organisms have been proposed, including coagulasenegative Staphylococcus species, various gram-negative bacilli, and Clostridium species. However, in approximately 35% of published outbreaks, no etiologic organism was identified. 1 This report summarizes an investigation of a NEC cluster among 11 premature infants in a NICU in New Mexico from January 22 to February 13, 2007 Medical charts for each casepatient were reviewed, and the following information was collected based on factors identified from previous reports of NEC clusters and the judgment of the clinical staff and investigative team: date of birth; estimated gestational age; birth weight; sex; admission date; APGAR score; date of NEC onset; NEC staging and accompanying signs and symptoms; previous diagnosis of NEC; detailed feeding history for #7 days before symptom onset; antimicrobial therapy and other pharmaceutical treatments; umbilical catheter; surgical treatment; hyaline membrane disease; and maternal risk factors, including prenatal care, gestational diabetes, drug abuse, and preeclampsia. Information regarding bed location and number of nurses and other health care providers caring for case-patients during the 2 days before symptom onset was also collected. Enhanced surveillance for NEC was conducted for 2 months following the last case of the cluster.",

Specifically, testing for anaerobic pathogens (eg, Clostridium species), coronavirus, rotavirus, and echovirus might be added to the initial set of diagnostic tests because they have been implicated in past outbreaks. 1 Unfortunately, systematic testing was not performed on all infants in this cluster. Echovirus and coronavirus testing were not performed, stool cultures were not ordered for the first 5 patients, and tissue samples were not available. The only testing for Clostridium species consisted of C difficile toxin testing. The clinical significance of a positive C difficile toxin test in this age group is uncertain. The potential role of HMF in this outbreak cannot be excluded. Specifically, prematurity is a widely reported risk factor for NEC, 3 which might be associated with prematurity of the gastrointestinal tract. 2, 3, 8 In addition, formula-fed infants are reported to have 6 to 20 times the risk of experiencing NEC compared with breast milk-fed infants. [9] [10] [11] An increased risk of NEC among preterm infants who were fed HMF has also been reported, 12, 13 and contamination 14 (including with B cereus 15, 16 ) has been postulated as a potential mechanism. In this investigation, 1 lot code of sequestered HMF tested positive for B cereus at the FDA's upper microbiologic limit (100 cfu/g). 17 Risk assessment models have concluded that powdered infant formula containing #100 cfu/g of B cereus and reconstituted with cooled boiled water (25 8C) and stored for #24 hours at #10 8C would not expose term infants to an infectious dose of B cereus; however, the risk to premature infants is unknown. Thus, because of similarities in ingredients and manufacturing processes between powdered formula and HMF, potential to improperly reconstitute and store fortified breast milk, and the unknown risk that B cereus poses to premature infants, a common mechanism might be shared by formula and HMF and warrants additional examination. Because anaerobic cultures of HMF were not performed, isolation of B cereus might be a marker of similar or even greater levels of contamination with anaerobic spore-forming organisms (eg, Clostridium species), which have been previously indicated in the etiology of NEC. 18 In this instance, the volume of HMF was insufficient to conduct both aerobic and anaerobic cultures.",

First, pathogens previously implicated in certain NEC outbreaks were not uniformly tested for in this investigation, in part because an outbreak was not apparent until 5 cases had been identified. This includes the lack of cultures for anaerobic bacteria in both clinical and food product specimens. Second, no tissue samples from patients' gastrointestinal tracts were available for confirmatory testing. Third, a case-control study would have allowed us to better characterize risk factors for NEC (including HMF) in this outbreak. (A case-control study was not conducted because of the insufficient power this small number of cases would have yielded.) Despite these limitations, this investigation demonstrates that considering other risk factors is critical when investigating NEC clusters and might serve as the basis for conducting more rigorous studies to evaluate the role of HMF consumption in the pathogenesis of NEC.",

Because powdered formula products, including HMF, are not sterile, careful attention should be given to contraindications for their use. NICU staff should consider documenting lot codes of nutritional products administered to their patients.
