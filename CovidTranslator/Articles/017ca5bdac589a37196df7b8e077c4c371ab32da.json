This seems important because MRSA infections have been associated with significantly greater prolongation of hospital stay and greater mortality than methicillin-susceptible S aureus infections, after adjustment for patients' underlying severity of illness [3, 4] . Many studies have reported significantly better control using surveillance cultures and contact precautions, including multiple studies in ICUs [4, 5] ; the consistency of evidence in different studies conducted by different investigators and in different populations was one of the criteria for causal inference advocated by Hill [6] . High strength of association, reversibility, a dose-response relation, and specificity have also been demonstrated [4] , and these features also suggest causality [6] . Although most of those studies used historical controls, multiple studies have used concurrent controls [4] . To date, all cost-effectiveness studies have concluded that it is less expensive to pay for detection and control than it is to use inadequate measures and let MRSA spread [4, 7] .",

Possible reasons include the following. First, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended since 1983 that colonized patients be cared for with contact precautions, and there was a lack of support from the US National Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for such studies from 1970 to 2000. Also, many studies have reported control using surveillance cultures/contact precautions, and there are ethical concerns about randomizing controls to what many studies suggest may be suboptimal protection against potentially lethal infection. Finally, with respect to cost, RCTs are in general expensive, and the expense is greater still for RCTs that must take account of widespread intrafacility and interfacility transmission [8] by making large facility clusters the unit of randomization. Recent meta-analyses of RCTs found that their results showed as much and sometimes more variability than those from unrandomized studies examining the same question, which neither overestimated nor underestimated the central tendency of the RCT results [9] .",

When closely examined, however, isolation/cohort nursing were in all but one case introduced as part of a varied package of measures, including closure of units, surveillance, reemphasis on hand washing, reduction in overcrowding, infection control nurses, and addition of other treatments [14] . A recent review of 46 studies of isolation policies in the management of MRSA by Cooper and coworkers [14] concluded that it was usually impossible to adjust for any variation in MRSA reservoir in different phases of these studies and most lacked proper statistical analysis. Furthermore, few studies were prospective, and many seemingly prospective studies occurred in response to new high MRSA levels. Of those that provided the strongest evidence, four suggested that infection control measures, including isolation, were effective whereas two implied that isolation failed to prevent endemic MRSA. Mathematical models also propose that isolation should be effective, but where infection is endemic they show that, despite effective control measures, the status quo can be maintained by new admissions [14, 15] . This suggests that the prevalence of MRSA is an important part of the equation. Across the world this varies enormously, with 60% of ICUs in Germany reporting no MRSA, contrasting with 11.4% acquiring MRSA in ICU in Australia and a point prevalence of 16.2% in UK ICUs [16] [17] [18] .",
