Azodicarbonamide (ADA), a compound used in the baking and plastics industries, has been reported to cause pulmonary sensitization and dermatitis in people. Two-week repeated and 13-week subchronic inhalation exposures of F344/N rats and B6C3Fi mice to ADA were conducted to determine the toxicity of inhaled ADA. The mean air concentrations of ADA in the 2-week studies were 207, 102, 52, 9.4, or 2.0 mg/m3. No exposure-related mortality nor abnormal clinical signs were observed in rats or mice during or after exposure. The terminal body weights were slightly depressed in the highest exposure group. Liver weights were lower in male rats exposed to 200 mg ADA/m3. No significant lesions were noted on either gross or histologic evaluation of rats or mice. In the 13week subchronic study, the mean air concentrations of ADA were 204, 100, or 50 mg/m3. No mortality or clinical signs related to exposure were observed. The terminal body weights of exposed rats were not significantly different from those of control rats but were significantly depressed in mice exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. No histopathological lesions were noted in mice. Lung weights were increased and enlarged mediastinal and/or tracheobronchial lymph nodes were noted in rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3. No exposure-related lesions were observed microscopically in rats exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. All rats in the 50 mg ADA/m3 exposure group only had lung lesions that consisted of perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and a multifocal type II cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible immune reaction to an antigen in the lung. Viral titers for rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m' were negative for Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice, which produce similar lesions. The possibility of an unknown viral antigen causing this lesion cannot be eliminated. Lung tissue from male rats was analyzed for ADA and biurea, the major metabolite of ADA. No ADA was detected. The amount of hiurea in the lungs increased nonlinearly with increasing exposure concentration, suggesting that clearance was somewhat impaired with repeated exposures. However, even at the highest exposure concentration, this amount of biurea was less than 1% of the estimated total ADA deposited over the exposure period. In summary, ADA is rapidly cleared from the lungs, even when inhaled at concentrations up to 200 mg/m3. Exposure to ADA for up to 13 weeks did not appear to be toxic to rodents. 0 1990 Society ofToxicology.",

Acetylcholinesterase concentrations in whole blood of rats only in the 13-week study and both rats and mice in the 2week study were determined using the method of Ellman et al. (1961) , in which acetylthiocholine is used as the substrate. Serum thyroxine (T4 or tetraiodothyronine) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels for rats exposed to ADA for 13 weeks were measured by radioimmunoassay (Tietz, 1986) .* Samples of lung and kidney from male rats exposed to ADA for 13 weeks were analyzed for ADA and biurea. This procedure involved derivatization of ADA with triphenylphosphine and quantitation ofthe resulting derivative by HPLC . Biurea in the sample was oxidized to ADA using potassium permanganate in acid solution. The ADA produced was then quantitated by HPLC (Bechtold er al., 1989) .",

            "text": "tions used in the studies reported here (i.e., 100 and 200 mg/m3) suggests that the lung lesions in rats are not related to ADA exposure. In addition, two recent studies of acute and repeated inhalation exposure to ADA in guinea pigs did not report any evidence of airway irritation (Shopp, 1987) or a potential for sensitization to ADA (Gerlach et al., 1989) . Pyelonephritis, renal tubular concretions, and intratubular renal crystals were noted after subchronic exposure of rats and mice to ADA by gavage, at levels of 2.5 g/kg body wt or greater per day. In the present study, no renal lesions were observed in animals exposed to 200 mg ADA/m3 for up to 13 weeks. The lack of renal toxicity in the present study is most likely related to differences in the total amount of ADA given to the animals in the two studies. For example, for the 2-to 3-pm particle size used in this study, total deposition should be about 49% (Raabe et al.. 1988) . For animals exposed to 200 mg ADA/ m3, with a 200 ml/min minute volume, the total amount of ADA deposited should be about 20-40 mg/kg body wt per day for 338-g males or 190-g females (mean terminal body weights of 200 mg/m3 group). This dose is 1 OO-fold lower than that resulting in nephrotoxicity.",

            "text": "The findings in male rats exposed to ADA for 65 or 66 exposure days are generally consistent with the findings of Mewhinney et al. (1987) , who showed that [ 14C]ADA deposited in the lungs of rats is rapidly absorbed into blood during the inhalation exposure and is cleared from tissues with a half-time of 1 day. The rats in the 13-week, ADA subchronic study were euthanized 16 to 18 hr after exposure to ADA was stopped. No ADA or biurea was detected in kidney tissue. The detection limit was at least 100 hg/g tissue. Thus, in the 13-week study, ADA and biurea were cleared from the kidney at least as fast as for the rats in the previous studies. The nonlinearity of the amount of biurea in the lungs of rats exposed for 65 or 66 days to ADA aerosols would not be expected, based on the results of the study by Mewhinney et al., in which the rats were exposed once for a period of 6 hr. This may, of course, be due to the much greater amount of ADA deposited in the lung over the 65-or 66-day period of exposure or to the higher exposure concentration in the 13-week study compared to that in the study involving 14C. The amount of biurea present in the lungs of rats exposed to ADA for 65 or 66 exposure days was small (N I%), compared to the total amount of ADA inhaled and deposited over the 13-week period.",
