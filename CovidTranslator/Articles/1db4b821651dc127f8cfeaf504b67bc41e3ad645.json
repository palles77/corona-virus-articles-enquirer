The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) was initiated in 1974 with the goal of providing universal immunization with essential vaccines. Among the initially targeted six vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, a substantial reduction in the burden of preventable childhood illnesses and deaths was achieved in its initial years [2, 3] . Over the past decades, national immunization programmes (NIPs) have become substantially more complex, with vaccines now available to protect against more than 20 infectious diseases, while health, societal, and political changes created additional volatility and ambiguity in often more uncertain environments (e.g., with the occurrence of conflicts, epidemics, or increasing vaccine hesitancy). Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, was established in2000 primarilytoallownew vaccines to reach children in the poorest countries [4] . Stagnating global immunization coverage rates in many countries led global partners of the Decade of Vaccines Collaboration 1 to initiate the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) in 2012 [5] . This plan states in its mission \"to extend, by 2020 and beyond, the full benefits of immunization to all people, regardless of where they are born, who they are, or where they live\". The im-1 WHO, UNICEF, Gavi, BMGF, NIAID. portant focus on equitable immunization uptake and coverage is also reflected in the present Gavi strategy 2016-2020, and will likely be sustained in a subsequent Gavi strategy leading up to 2025 [6] and in the new Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030) [7] .",

Elimination and eradication goals for polio, measles, rubella, and neonatal tetanus have not been met everywhere and vaccine-derived polio virus and measles outbreaks are still circulating. Importantly, not every child or eligible person is being reached everywhere [11, 12] . Inequities in vaccine uptake and disease persist across countries, and inequalities in routine immunization coverage can contribute to the continued occurrence and outbreaks of VPDs. The global coverage of the third dose of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-pertussis (DPT) vaccine is stagnating at 86% with little change since 2010. In some countries, progress has even gone into reverse. One in 10 infants worldwide has still not received any vaccine as reflected in first dose DPT coverage and an estimated 19.4 million infants were not reached with routine immunization services such as three primary doses of DPT vaccine [8, 13] .",

In many situations, governments face challenges in reaching such underserved populations or lack the political will to do so. Increasingly, there are also substantial inequities in vaccine use between urban and rural populations [20] , with coverage in urban slum populations often as low as in remote rural communities. A preliminary sce-nario based on projected proportions of unimmunized children in rural and urban areas shows that almost half (44%) of the unimmunized and under-immunized children in the top 10 countries that were home to more than half of the unimmunized and under-immunized children in 2017 lived in urban areas, and almost every fifth unimmunized child (18%) lived in a slum [21, 22] .

In this framework, delivery of immunization services through fixed health facilities and mobile outreach services is considered the most basic means for reaching all populations. This includes strategies for detecting and reaching marginalized and partially served populations, adjusting service availability and convenience, creating synergies with accelerated disease control activities, and creating demand for vaccination. These routine services may be supplemented by a strategy termed the Periodic Intensification of Routine Immunization (PIRI) as a mechanism to catch up individuals who may have missed their routine doses. Another strategy to rapidly increase population immunity is to deliver additional doses of vaccines through supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) or vaccination campaigns.",

Global vaccination coverage has dramatically improved and mortality rates among children due to vaccine-preventable diseases have been significantly reduced since the creation of the Expanded Programme of Immunization in 1974, the formation of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in 2000, and the development of the Global Vaccine Action Plan in 2012. However, challenges remain and persisting inequities in vaccine uptake contribute to the continued occurrence and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Inequalities in immunization coverage by geography, urbanrural, and socio-economic status jeopardize the achievement of global immunization goals and call for renewed immunization strategies. These should take into account emerging opportunities for building better immunization systems and services, as well as the development of new vaccine products and delivery technologies. Such strategies need to achieve equity in vaccination coverage across and within countries. This will require the participation of communities, a better understanding of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, the expansion of vaccination across the life course, approaches to improve immunization in middle-income countries, enhanced use of data and possible financial and non-financial incentives. Vaccines also have an important role to play in comprehensive disease control, including the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Lessons learned from disease eradication and elimination efforts of polio, measles and maternal and neonatal tetanus are instrumental in further enhancing global immunization strategies in line with the revised goals and targets of the new Immunization Agenda 2030, which is currently being developed.",

These new contacts with the health systems will also offer opportunities to provide missed vaccine doses that should have been administered earlier. New platforms for vaccine delivery are further explored, such as antenatal maternal services, pre-school and school-based delivery, adolescent health programs, as well as risk-based, targeted services for health workers and for specific patient groups in need of certain vaccines (e.g., diabetics).",

The use of vaccines against hepatitis B, pneumococcal, rotavirus, and HPV infection are vital interventions in the broader disease control efforts against chronic liver disease, acute respiratory infections, meningitis, severe diarrhoea, and cervical cancer [43] . Elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus as a public health problem should be achievable in the near future in the remaining 12 countries (as of July 2019) by applying integrated strategies and activities including the immunization of children, mothers, and women of reproductive age together with the promotion of clean deliveries and cord care practices. In this broader context, tetanus toxoid will successively be replaced with tetanus-diphtheria vaccines to ensure sustained protection against both diseases [44] . The new WHO strategy to achieve the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health concern focuses on increasing the coverage of vaccination against HPV as one of three key targets besides screening and HPV testing [45] . NIPs can also help to further increase equitable coverage of other health interventions, such as vitamin A supplementation, anti-helminthic treatment, nutrition interventions, insecticide-impregnated bed-nets, and intermittent preventive treatment against malaria. Other important preventive interventions are being added, e.g., for adolescents [46] . Improving coordination and collaboration between immunization and other preventive and curative services can result in efficiency gains, save resources by offering one-stop services at the point of delivery, and increase the use of social mobilization to increase demand [16] . In addition, non-governmental and private vaccinators can enhance the ability of programmes to deliver recommended vaccine doses, especially to clients who prefer them over public services.",

Drug resistant infections may already cause 700,000 deaths per year and it is estimated that 10 million deaths due to AMR may occur every year after 2050 [49] . Vaccines can impact antibiotic-resistant infections through a direct reduction in the resistant organisms and strains that are specifically targeted by the vaccine, as well as through a reduction in common illnesses that often lead to the use of antibiotics and therefore selection pressure on pathogens [50] . The widespread use of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal vaccines have resulted in a dramatic reduction in disease burden and have been associated with decreased incidence of resistant strains. Universal coverage with pneumococcal vaccination could potentially avoid more than 11 million days of antibiotic use per year in children under 5 [51, 52] . A newer typhoid conjugate vaccine has a potential for high impact on prevention and control of antimicrobial resistant typhoid fever and was recently strategically used to control an extensively drug resistant typhoid outbreak in Pakistan [53] . But vaccines against viruses, e.g., influenza, can also exert a major impact here, due to the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. Vaccines offer a more sustainable approach to infection prevention, since pathogen resistance to vaccines is uncommon [51] . The equitable use of vaccines is expected to avert substantial parts of the AMRrelated fraction of disease, reduce antibiotic use, and-together with other interventions across human and animal health-add to the reduction in the economic and societal burden of AMR [54] .",

Where possible, such initiatives should be combined with other vaccines or interventions, as appropriate, to maximize impact and achieve efficiency gains [62] . Capacities for the rapid deployment of vaccines and other interventions have been strengthened as a legacy of polio eradication and measles elimination efforts.

Dennoch bleiben Herausforderungen bestehen, und die anhaltenden Unterschiede in den Impfquoten tragen dazu bei, dass weiterhin Krankheiten auftreten, die durch Impfungen vermeidbar w\u00e4ren. Die Ungleichheit beim Erreichen hoher Impfquoten -geographisch, aber auch nach Stadt/Land oder sozio\u00f6konomischem Status -gef\u00e4hrdet die globalen Impfziele und macht neue Strategien erforderlich. Hierbei sollten neue Ans\u00e4tze zum Aufbau verbesserter Impfsysteme und Impfangebote sowie die Entwicklung neuer Impfstoffe und Impfstofftechnologien Ber\u00fccksichtigung finden. Solche Strategien m\u00fcssen zudem daf\u00fcr sorgen, dass eine gerechtere Verteilung von Impfungen zwischen und innerhalb von L\u00e4ndern m\u00f6glich wird. Dies erfordert die Beteiligung der Bev\u00f6lkerung auf lokaler Ebene, ein besseres Verst\u00e4ndnis von Impfakzeptanz und -skepsis, die Ausweitung von Impfprogrammen \u00fcber alle Lebensphasen, die Verbesserung des Impfwesens in L\u00e4ndern mittleren Einkommens, die verst\u00e4rkte Nutzung von Daten f\u00fcr die Planung und Evaluation von Impfprogrammen sowie finanzielle und nichtfinanzielle Anreize. Impfstoffe spielen zudem eine wichtige Rolle bei der umfassenden Kontrolle von Krankheiten, einschlie\u00dflich der Antibiotikaresistenz. Dar\u00fcber hinaus sind die Erfahrungen, die bei den Bem\u00fchungen zur Ausrottung und Eliminierung von Poliomyelitis, Masern sowie m\u00fctterlichem und neonatalem Tetanus gemacht wurden, entscheidend f\u00fcr die weitere Verbesserung globaler Impfstrategien im Einklang mit den \u00fcberarbeiteten Zielen und Vorgaben der neuen globalen Impfagenda 2030, die gegenw\u00e4rtig entwickelt wird.",
