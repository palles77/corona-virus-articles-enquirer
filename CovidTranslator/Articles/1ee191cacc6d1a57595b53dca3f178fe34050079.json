Non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing face masks, social distancing) are known to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses from person to person and are therefore recommended to pilgrims by public health agencies. The implementation of effective public health policies and recommendations involves evaluating the adherence to and effectiveness of these measures in the specific context of the Hajj. This review summarizes the evidence related to the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in preventing the spread of respiratory infectious diseases during the Hajj. Overall, although hand hygiene compliance is high among pilgrims, face mask use and social distancing remain difficult challenges. Data about the effectiveness of these measures at the Hajj are limited, and results are contradictory, highlighting the need for future large-scale studies. \u00aa",

            "text": "Annually, over two million Muslims from more than 180 countries gather in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca, also known as the \"Hajj\". The Hajj is the fifth pillar of Islam and is mandatory for all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable at least once in their lifetime. The pilgrims usually stay in the KSA for up to 4 weeks. Upon arrival in Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, most Hajj pilgrims begin their visit by performing the \"Umrah\" (also known as the minor pilgrimage). The rituals of the Umrah can be undertaken at any time of the year and include the circumambulation of the Kaaba (Tawaf ) in very crowded conditions (Fig. 1 ) and seven trips (Sa'i) between two small mountains (Al-Safa and Al-Marwah) inside the Grand Mosque (Al-Masjid al Haram). The Hajj, which retraces the footsteps of the Prophet Mohammed over approximately one week, is performed from the 8th to the 13th of the last month of the lunar Islamic calendar, called \"Dhul Hijja\" (i.e., \"the month of Hajj\"). As part of the Hajj rituals, pilgrims travel to different sacred places located around the city of Mecca, including Mina, where they camp during the 5-day period of the Hajj in tents (Fig. 2 ) in close contact with others; the plain of Arafat for the culminating experience of the Hajj; and Muzdalifah. While not required as part of the Hajj, most pilgrims leave Mecca after a final circumambulation of the Kaaba (Tawaf al-Wada), traveling to the city of Medina to visit Islam's second holiest site, the Mosque of the Prophet, which contains Muhammad's tomb.",

            "text": "The presence of a large number of pilgrims from many parts of the world in congested and crowded areas, especially when performing the circumambulation of the Kaaba inside the Grand Mosque in Mecca and when using the pedestrian tunnels leading to the Jamarat bridge in Mina, where each pilgrim performs the ritual of \"Jamarat\" (stoning the columns symbolizing the Devil), greatly increases the risk of spreading infectious diseases [1] , particularly respiratory diseases [2] . It was reported that the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among a cohort of French pilgrims during the 2012 Hajj was 90%, with cough (83%) and sore throat (78%) as the most commonly reported symptoms [3] . Similarly high prevalences of respiratory symptoms were observed in both Iranian and Malaysian cohorts of pilgrims [4, 5] . Respiratory diseases are by far the main reason for consultation among pilgrims attending primary health care centers during the Hajj [6] . In addition, respiratory diseases are major causes of hospital admission during the Hajj [7] , with pneumonia being a leading cause of hospitalization in intensive care units [8] . In a recent study of Indonesian pilgrims, respiratory diseases were found to be the second most common cause of death, immediately after cardiovascular diseases [9] . Respiratory viruses, especially influenza virus, are the main cause of acute respiratory infection (ARI) during the Hajj [10e13]. High prevalences of rhinovirus [3] and Streptococcus pneumoniae [14] were found in pilgrims returning from the Hajj, highlighting the potential of pilgrims to spread these infections to their household contacts upon return to their countries of origin. However, although international outbreaks of Neisseria meningitides serogroup W135 occurred in 2001 and 2002 [15, 16] , no respiratory epidemics linked to the Hajj have been reported to date.",

Consequently, in addition to vaccination, non-pharmaceutical interventions are recommended by various national and international public health agencies, including the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH), the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to prevent the spread of infections during the pilgrimage or in the pilgrims' home countries upon their return [19e21] . These measures include maintaining hand hygiene, particularly hand washing with soap and water and the use of hand sanitizer; using disposable tissues when coughing or sneezing and disposing of these tissues in a [34] (continued on next page) waste basket; attempting as much as possible to avoid hand contact with the eyes, nose and mouth; avoiding direct contact with ill individuals; wearing masks, especially when in crowded places; and maintaining good personal hygiene, with the aim of interrupting or reducing the spread of infections from person to person.

            "text": "Major studies addressing the knowledge and practice of pilgrims concerning Hajj-related health problems have been conducted in the past by the Saudi Arabia Field Epidemiology Training program [22, 23] . Large multinational samples of pilgrims were recruited while staying in Mina and interviewed using a self-administered questionnaire. As part of these studies, face mask use was reported by only 17.8% of the respondents during the 1998 Hajj season [22] compared to 24% and 33.2% in 1999 and 2002, respectively [22, 23] . In a large cohort study of pilgrims recruited during the pre-travel consultation, 53.6% of those who were followed up by telephone after the 2003 Hajj reported using face masks during the pilgrimage [24, 25] . A survey of knowledge, attitude and practice was conducted in the city of Marseille among French pilgrims intending to perform the 2008 Hajj who attended a pre-Hajj meningococcal vaccination campaign [26] . Of the respondents in this study, prior to travel, only 41.3% were aware that face masks could protect them from ARI, and 24.6% were aware that face masks could be used for community protection [26] . However, the willingness of pilgrims to wear face masks during the Hajj was high (91.7%) after the importance of their use was explained [26] . The effect of a health promotion intervention and the distribution of free face masks were evaluated in a study in 2004, showing a significant increase in face mask use among pilgrims who received both health promotion and free face masks (81.3%) compared to controls who did not receive health education or face masks (33.6%) [27] . In another study of patients attending Mina hospitals in 2007, pilgrims who received health education were also significantly more likely to wear face masks during the Hajj than those who did not [28] . However, the overall compliance with face mask use of pilgrims in this study was low (12.1%) [28] . These interventions have improved pilgrim compliance with face mask use during the Hajj; however, it was not stated in these studies whether pilgrims used their masks frequently or intermittently. The compliance with face mask use of French pilgrims who were recruited during their pre-travel consultation was investigated by telephone questionnaire as the pilgrims returned to France after the 2009 Hajj [29] . In this study, the percentage of pilgrims who self-reported using face masks during the pilgrimage was 79.6% [29] . In a large cross-sectional survey conducted before the 2009 Hajj, 35.1% of pilgrims arriving at the King Abdulaziz international airport in Jeddah reported wearing a face mask, and only 44.7% were aware of this measure as a way to prevent H1N1 infection [30] . A cohort study was conducted among pilgrims traveling from Riyadh with the intention to perform the Hajj in 2010. Pilgrims were recruited as they sought their required pre-Hajj meningococcal vaccination and followed up by telephone upon their return from the Hajj. In this study, 56.5% of pilgrims reported using face masks during the pilgrimage [31] . This result is comparable to that reported in another study conducted among French pilgrims during the 2012 Hajj by a medical doctor traveling with the pilgrims, in which 55.1% of pilgrims actually used face masks during the pilgrimage [3] . Other studies conducted among pilgrims from various countries [5, 32, 33] have shown variable results (Table 1) . However, study designs and populations were highly variable from one study to another and did not allow for relevant comparisons. In an interesting recent study about face mask usage among pilgrims during the 5-day Hajj periods of 2009 and 2013, photos of the moving crowd taken from elevated areas revealed that significantly more pilgrims used face masks during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) outbreak than during the 2013 MERS-CoV outbreak; however, compliance was low in both years [34] . It must be noted that in this study, face masks were provided as part of a welcome kit to each arriving pilgrim at the international airport in Jeddah.",

One study conducted among Indonesian pilgrims reported that pilgrims who did not use a face mask (that were provided to pilgrims by the Indonesian Hajj committee free of charge) during the Hajj had a threefold greater risk of acquiring an acute upper respiratory tract infection compared to those using face masks [32] . A significant reduction in respiratory symptoms was also observed in a Saudi [31] study, whereas several other studies reported no significant effect [5, 29, 33, 35] . A second Saudi study showed a significant reduction in respiratory symptoms with face mask use, but only in the male or total sample and not in the female group [24, 25] . Two other studies have addressed the impact of face mask use during the Hajj on the prevalence of both respiratory symptoms and viral pathogens using PCR assays from pilgrim nasal samples, and no significant effect was observed [30, 3] .",

Overall, 67.2% of respondents reported washing their hands frequently during the pilgrimage [22] . In a large prospective study of domestic pilgrims from Central Saudi Arabia, 90.3% and 45.5% reported, on their return from the 2010 Hajj, washing their hands more than 5 times per day and using hand sanitizer during the pilgrimage, respectively [31] . In another study of pilgrims attending two randomly selected Mina hospitals during the 2007 Hajj season, only 31.5% reported washing their hands frequently [28] . However, in this study, the pilgrims who received health education washed their hands significantly more frequently during the Hajj than those who did not [28] . A study assessing the compliance with protective measures among US pilgrims prior to and following travel to the 2009 Hajj reported that 67.2% of the respondents practiced hand hygiene during the pilgrimage [33] . However, in a second study conducted among the same cohort of US pilgrims with the aim of evaluating the possible effects of knowledge acquired from taking the pre-travel survey, the impact of the pre-travel survey as an effective means of health communication or education for pilgrims remained unclear [36] . A large crosssectional survey conducted in 2009 among pilgrims arriving at the King Abdulaziz international airport in Jeddah showed that 48.1% and 28.5% of pilgrims were aware that frequent hand washing and use of hand sanitizer, respectively, could prevent H1N1 infection [30] . The proportions were even lower among French pilgrims intending to perform the 2008 Hajj, with less than 10% and 3% of participants being aware prior to travel of frequent hand washing and use of hand disinfectant, respectively, as precautions against respiratory infections [26] . However, this study revealed high levels of acceptance of these measures among participants (>90%) after their importance was explained [26] . Upon return from the 2009 Hajj, 69.7% and 77.4% of French pilgrims have self-reported increased hand washing and increased use of hand disinfectant, respectively, during the pilgrimage [29] . More recently, the compliance with hand hygiene among French pilgrims during the 2012 Hajj was also assessed by a medical doctor traveling with them, and 40.3% and 46.3% of pilgrims actually washed their hands more than usual and used hand sanitizer, respectively, during the pilgrimage [3] .",

On the contrary, hand washing was significantly associated with symptoms of influenza-like illness and with a higher prevalence of respiratory viruses during the 2012 Hajj [3] .",

This coincidence led the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health to organize, in 2009, a health experts' meeting in Jeddah [37] , with the participation of consultants from global public health agencies. This consultation resulted in several practical recommendations for reducing the pandemic's effects during the Hajj [37, 38] . Among several recommendations, one of the most challenging was to ask the population groups considered to be at high risk of complications from influenza (pregnant women, people with underlying comorbidities, people older than 65 years and children younger than 12 years) to voluntarily refrain from participating in the 2009 Hajj. An assessment of compliance with these recommendations among French pilgrims actually participating in the 2009 Hajj showed that at least one risk factor for complications from H1N1 virus infection was present in 49.5% of them [39] . In 2013, because of concerns over the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with the KSA identified as the epicenter of the outbreak, the WHO published the 2013 Hajj requirement [19] in which the Saudi Ministry of Health recommended that elderly people (older than 65 years); those with chronic diseases (such as heart disease, kidney disease, respiratory disease, and diabetes); and pilgrims with immune deficiency (congenital and acquired), malignant disease, and terminal illnesses, as well as pregnant women and children (younger than 12 years), not perform the Hajj and Umrah that year [19, 20] . In a recent study, at least one of these risk factors was found in one out of two French pilgrims undertaking the 2013 Hajj season [40, 41] . In another study of French pilgrims recruited during their pre-travel consultation before the 2013 Hajj season, it appears that two-thirds of the participants were aware of the MERS-CoV situation in Saudi Arabia, and one-third were aware of the Saudi recommendation for all individuals in these high-risk groups to postpone their participation in the 2013 Hajj; however, none of them decided to cancel their participation, even after this advice was given [41] .",

It is often difficult to assess the effect of one intervention independently from other interventions or other factors in infection control, such as environmental hygiene, crowding and education. Moreover, most studies used different clinical criteria for evaluating the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in pilgrims during the Hajj and were conducted in different settings, including hospitals and airports, with possible bias in the inclusion process. Additionally, some of these studies were performed among small numbers of pilgrims and cannot be extrapolated. Because compliance with these preventive measures appears to be highly variable from one study to another, studying heterogeneous populations of pilgrims in different settings as well as the use of different methods may limit the ability to identify effective measures. Future large-scale prospective intervention studies should be designed to accurately estimate the effectiveness of and adherence to each measure in preventing respiratory tract infections during the Hajj.",

            "text": "At this time, the improvement of face mask use among pilgrims is a major challenge. In fact, there appears to be a discrepancy between willingness, perceived compliance and actual compliance of pilgrims with respect to face mask use. While several studies showed that face mask use is highly accepted by pilgrims providing that educational intervention is implemented, such intervention is impractical in the context of the Hajj. Various reasons may partially explain the low compliance of face mask usage. First, the stifling heat (in Mecca during October, the average temperature is >38 C during the day and >25 C at night) makes conditions worse and the continuous wearing of masks more difficult to achieve, especially for elderly pilgrims. In addition, pilgrims must carry out the ritual washing (which involves washing the face with water) before each of the five obligatory prayers, forcing them to remove their masks several times per day. Finally, due to the overcrowded conditions in the tent camps where pilgrims spend most of their time during the 5-day period of the Hajj, they are encouraged to take minimum personal belongings with them in a small bag, making it much more difficult for them to transport a large number of disposable face masks. However, in addition to compliance, an important issue is whether masks are being worn correctly by the pilgrims. The effectiveness of face masks in preventing the transmission of influenza and ARIs is dependent on various factors, including setting and compliance. Thus, the role of face mask use has been advocated in a number of studies conducted in multiple settings, including health care facilities, household contacts of index case patients, and university residents. Although most studies have found that the use of masks was associated with a reduced risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome, none of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask use and protection against influenza infection [42, 43] . Moreover, metadata from these studies indicated that wearing surgical masks did not change the frequency of laboratoryconfirmed influenza [44] . As the effectiveness of face masks is likely linked to early, consistent and correct usage, we continue to recommend their use, although available studies do not provide strong evidence for their effectiveness in the prevention of the viral respiratory infection known as \"Hajj cough\". Some actions that may be taken to improve compliance with face mask use are the launch of recall campaigns during the Hajj to inform pilgrims of the importance of face mask and how to use it properly, and free mask distribution to pilgrims, particularly during their stay in Mina.",

            "text": "Despite their poor knowledge of the usefulness of hand hygiene in preventing respiratory infections, hand washing compliance of pilgrims during the Hajj is usually quite good. This finding is not surprising because in several cultures and religions, hand hygiene is not only an action aimed at body care. In Islam, the ritual purification takes the form of ablution (Wudu), which is, in most cases, repeated before the five daily obligatory prayers. Ablution consists of the methodical washing of the hands, mouth, nose, face, forearm, head, ears, and feet three times each with running water. The effectiveness of hand hygiene interventions varies depending on setting, context and compliance [45] . Several reviews of published work have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hand hygiene in preventing respiratory tract infections, especially in the health care setting [46e48]. Available evidence suggests that hand hygiene might help reduce the transmission of a range of important nosocomial pathogens [47] and acute respiratory tract infections [45] . However, hygienic hand disinfection has better efficacy than hand washing [47, 49] . During their stay in Mina, pilgrims live in crowded tent camps where the water and sanitation that are available outside the tents are to be used collectively. Frequent hand washing outside the ritual context of ablution may be difficult in these conditions. Additionally, during a few days of the Hajj, when pilgrims are in the state of \"Ihram\" (a sacred state that pilgrims must enter to perform the pilgrimage), they are not allowed to use scented soap, and although unscented soap may be available, pilgrims most commonly wash their hands only with water. Alcohol-based hand rubs may be better than traditional hand washing, as they require less time, act more rapidly, and contribute to sustained improvement in compliance associated with decreased infection rates [47, 49] . Therefore, as alcohol is permitted as a medicinal agent within Islam [50, 51] , the implementation of effective hand hygiene practices focusing on the regular use of alcohol-based hand rubs is recommended. Promotion of hand hygiene among pilgrims attending the Hajj should continue as a preventive measure against both respiratory and diarrheal diseases [52] .",

In fact, the Hajj is the religious high point of a Muslim's life and is usually performed once in a lifetime. Due to financial constraints, it is often planned years in advance. Therefore, particularly considering the advanced age of most pilgrims, it must be a very difficult decision for them to voluntarily cancel or postpone their plans to perform the Hajj.",

Some large cohort studies on the risk of acquiring pathogens during the Hajj are ongoing among multinational samples of pilgrims. The roles of host (e.g., age, underlying chronic diseases, vaccination status) and environmental factors in pathogen transmission will also be addressed. Interventional studies assessing the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical individual measures in preventing the spread of respiratory infectious diseases will be conducted. In particular, large randomized controlled trials on face mask use will be conducted among cohorts of pilgrims from several countries [44] . It is expected that the results of these studies will lead to the implementation of evidence-based recommendations on preventive measures such as face mask use, hand hygiene and other individual measures for pilgrims participating in the Hajj in the next years. Investigations exploring the link between communication and behavior will also be conducted to provide the evidence base for the adoption of effective approaches to improving communication with pilgrims and to better meet the needs of diverse communities.",
