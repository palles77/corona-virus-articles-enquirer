Little information is available on its radiologic manifestations in children. Objective: The goal of this study was to characterize the radiographic presentation of children with SARS. Materials and methods: We abstracted data (n=62) on the radiologic appearance and course of SARS in pediat-ric patients with suspect (n=25) or probable (n=37) SARS, diagnosed in five hospital sites located in three cities: Toronto, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Available chest radiographs and thoracic CTs were reviewed for the presence of the following radiographic findings: airspace disease, air bronchograms, airways inflammation and peribronchial thickening, interstitial disease, pleural effusion, and hilar adenopathy. Results: A total of 62 patients (suspect=25, probable=37) were evaluated for SARS. Patient ages ranged from 5.5 months to 17 years and 11.5 months (average, 6 years and 10 months) with a female-tomale ratio of 32:30. Forty-one patients (66.1%) were in close contact with other probable, suspect, or quarantined cases; 10 patients (16.1%) had recently traveled to WHO-designated affected areas within 10 days; and 7 patients (11.2%) were transferred from other hospitals that had SARS patients. Three patients, who did not have close/hospital contact or travel history to affected areas, were classified",

A suspect case is disease in a person with documented fever (temperature >38\u00b0C), one or more respiratory tract symptoms (including cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing), and close contact with a person believed to have had SARS (living with, caring for, or having had direct contact within 10 days of onset of symptoms, exposure to respiratory secretions and/or body fluids of a person with SARS) and/or a history of travel (within 10 days of onset of SARS symptoms) to an endemic geographic area with documented foci of illness transmission. A probable case is defined as a suspect case with chest radiographic findings of pneumonia, acute severe respiratory distress, or an unexplained respiratory illness resulting in death with autopsy results demonstrating the pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome without an identifiable cause. Probable cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often have a more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, as well as radiographic signs of atypical pneumonia [13, 14, 15] .",

Clinical presentations were reviewed for as SARS cases based on their clinical signs and symptoms and on the fact that they were living in an endemic area. The most prominent clinical presentations were fever, with a temperature over 38\u00b0C (100%), cough (62.9%), rhinorrhea (22.6%), myalgia (17.7%), chills (14.5%), and headache (11.3%). Other findings included sore throat (9.7%), gastrointestinal symptoms (9.7%), rigor (8.1%), and lethargy (6.5%). In general, fever and cough were the most common clinical presentations amongst younger pediatric SARS cases (age<10 years), whereas, in addition to these symptoms, headache, myalgia, sore throat, chills, and/or rigor were common in older patients (age \u202110 years). The chest radiographs of 35.5% of patients were normal. The most prominent radiological findings that were observed in the remaining patients were areas of consolidation (45.2%), often peripheral with multifocal lesions in 22.6%. Peribronchial thickening was noted on chest radiographs of 14.5% of patients. Pleural effusion was observed only in one patient (age 17 years and 11.5 months), whereas interstitial disease was not observed in any patient. Conclusion: In pediatric cases, SARS manifests with nonspecific radiographic features making radio-logical differentiation difficult, especially from other commonly encountered childhood respiratory viral illnesses causing airspace disease. The radiographic presentation of suspected SARS cases ranged from normal to mild perihilar peribronchial thickening. The radiographic presentations, as expected, were relatively more pronounced in the SARS probable cases.",

Specific evaluation criteria included: the presence or absence of pulmonary overinflation, bronchial wall thickening, interstitial disease, atelectasis, airspace disease (ground-glass opacification, patchy, focal or lobar consolidation), nodules, pleural effusion, air bronchogram, hilar adenopathy, and extrapulmonary air. Other radiological features, if present, were also noted. A combination of posteroanterior, lateral, and portable anteroposterior views was available. A standard radiographic technique was utilized, with most patients having portable examinations with anteroposterior views only. If a thoracic CT was obtained, the CT findings were also reviewed. A standard CT or thin-section CT technique was utilized as described elsewhere [27] .",

SARS is a new viral disease that must now be considered when faced with a child with fever and respiratory symptoms. Highly contagious, SARS was first identified in Guangdong Province in Southern China late last year.

The impact upon affected regions has been significant, both medically and economically.

Initial chest radiograph revealed mild perihilar peribronchial thickening and patchy, multifocal infiltrates at the left lung base Fig. 2 A 29-month-old boy with probable SARS from household contact presented with fever (38.2\u00b0C) and cough. Initial chest radiograph showed a focal area of airspace opacification in the right lower lobe Fig. 3 A 16 -month-old girl with probable SARS with recent travel history to Guangdong Province, South China, presented with fever and cough. Initial chest radiograph revealed a patchy opacity in right upper lobe and a mild peribronchial thickening extending into the lower lobes. Subsequent radiographs showed decreased opacity within the right upper lobe and an increased density within the right infrahilar region Fig. 4 A 17 -year-old girl with probable SARS exposed through household contact. Signs and symptoms of the patient at admission included fever (40.1\u00b0C), cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and bilateral crackles. The initial radiograph revealed dense airspace disease involving the right middle lobe and posterior left lower lobe novel coronavirus as the etiologic agent of SARS [3, 5, 8, 38, 39] . Clinically, children show similar symptoms to those already reported in adults including fever, cough, headache, and myalgia. However, dyspnea, malaise, and hypoxemia are less commonly encountered in childhood. The typical pediatric presentation is rapid onset of high fever with cough. Compared with adults, children with SARS seem to have a milder clinical course, especially for those under the age of 10 years [26, 33] .",

Many children that were initially suspected of having SARS were eventually excluded upon availability of the results of standard microbiologic investigations. For example, at one institution (Toronto) we had ten children present with clinical and epidemiological criteria consistent with a diagnosis of suspect or probable SARS, but who were later shown to have other infections. These other infections included viral respiratory tract infections such as adenovirus, influenza (A and B) , parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus and bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. Further, using the current criteria, there are likely to be false-negative cases as well. Some children may be inappropriately thought not to have SARS due to our incomplete knowledge of the full extent of SARS clinical presentations, especially at the early or mild stage of the disease. A few adult close contacts have reported a mild, febrile illness without definite respiratory signs or symptoms suggesting that the illness might not always primarily involve the respiratory tract. This appears to be true in children as well, with some in our study having minimal or no clear respiratory symptoms and a nonspecific febrile illness despite extensive contact history [33] . Although gastrointestinal symptoms are usually absent, some children reported vomiting and/or diarrhea [22, 26, 33] , while several adults have presented solely with severe abdominal pain. The relative infectivity of these patients remains unclear and until more is learned, caution and full infection control procedures are recommended.",

Since the clinical presentation in most of our pediatric cases was mild, CT was not considered necessary in two sites (Toronto and Singapore). For the Hong Kong patients (PWH and PMH patient cohort), chest CT was used for patients with suspected SARS but with normal chest radiographs, patients with a moderate to severe clinical course of the disease, and patients without contact history. Use of CT may be justified if management depends upon positive lung findings; however, suspect SARS patients were also admitted and managed in a similar fashion to those with positive chest radiograph findings.

Goggles or visors are also recommended during direct patient contact, especially for aerosol-generating procedures such as suction or intubation [46] . Cleansing of all radiographic equipment and rooms is important and consideration must be given to ensuring safe patient flow [41] . Training and audit of inappropriate use of infection control measures have been documented as significant factors leading to health-care worker transmission. Other factors include failure to apply appropriate isolation precautions to known SARS cases or cases which have not yet been identified as SARS and, finally, infected workers continuing to work despite infection. It is possible that all respiratory infections at initial presentation will need to be regarded as potential SARS cases until proven otherwise.",

It is likely that the application of the case definitions was variable to some degree across the different communities and we lack knowledge as to whether the virus remains the same across these three distinct clusters. At this point we cannot be sure that all cases were indeed SARS, and potentially other etiologies may have been included. Limiting diagnosis to contact with a known case, although a valuable criterion, can lead to false-positive and false-negative cases especially as the disease spreads into the broader community [26] . Community spread has not been identified in Toronto and Singapore; however, Hong Kong has encountered this problem at PWH and PMH where three RT-PCR confirmed SARS cases were reported without definite contact history. Although standard nomenclature was used, other potential limitations of SARS diagnosis included the fact that we relied upon local interpretation of radiographs and review of radiology reports, which may be subject to some variation in interpretation of images.",
