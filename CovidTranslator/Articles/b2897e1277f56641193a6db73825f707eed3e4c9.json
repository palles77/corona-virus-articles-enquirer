Their generation involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis that resembles copy-choice RNA recombination. During this process, the nascent RNA strand is transferred from one site in the template to another, during either plus or minus strand synthesis, to yield subgenomic RNA molecules. Central to this process are transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which are present at both template sites and ensure the \u00aedelity of strand transfer. Here we present results of a comprehensive co-variation mutagenesis study of equine arteritis virus TRSs, demonstrating that discontinuous RNA synthesis depends not only on base pairing between sense leader TRS and antisense body TRS, but also on the primary sequence of the body TRS. While the leader TRS merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer, the body TRS ful\u00aels multiple functions. The sequences of mRNA leader\u00b1body junctions of TRS mutants strongly suggested that the discontinuous step occurs during minus strand synthesis.",

Practically every nucleotide of their genome is utilized, either as protein-coding sequence or as cis-acting signals for translation, RNA synthesis or RNA encapsidation. As part of their genome expression strategy, several groups of positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses produce subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (reviewed by Miller and Koev, 2000) . The replication of their genomic RNA, which is also the mRNA for the viral replicase, is supplemented with the generation of sg transcripts to express structural and auxiliary proteins, which are encoded downstream of the replicase gene in the genome. Sg mRNAs of +RNA viruses are always 3\u00a2-co-terminal with the genomic RNA, but different mechanisms are used for their synthesis.",

Members of the order Nidovirales, which includes coronaviruses and arteriviruses, have evolved a third and unique mechanism, which employs discontinuous RNA synthesis for the generation of an extensive set of sg RNAs (reviewed by Brian and Spaan, 1997; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) .

            "text": "Various models have been put forward to explain the cotranscriptional fusion of non-contiguous parts of the nidovirus genome during sg RNA synthesis ( Figure 1B and C). Central to each of these models are short transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which are present both at the 3\u00a2 end of the leader and at the 5\u00a2 end of the sg RNA body regions in the genomic RNA. The TRS is copied into the mRNA and connects its leader and body part (Spaan et al., 1983; Lai et al., 1984) . Synthesis of sg mRNAs initially was proposed to be primed by free leader transcripts, which would base-pair to the complementary TRS regions in the full-length minus strand, and would be extended subsequently to make sg plus strands ( Figure 1B ; Baric et al., 1983 Baric et al., , 1985 . This model, however, was based on the report that sg minus strands were not present in coronavirus-infected cells (Lai et al., 1982) . The subsequent discovery of such molecules (Sethna et al., 1989) resulted in reconsideration of the initial`leader-primed transcription' model. Sawicki and Sawicki (1995) have proposed an alternative model ( Figure 1C ), in which the discontinuous step occurs during minus instead of plus strand RNA synthesis. In this model, minus strand synthesis would be attenuated after copying a body TRS from the plus strand template. Next, the nascent minus strand, with the TRS complement at its 3\u00a2 end, would be transferred to the leader TRS and attach by means of TRS\u00b1TRS base pairing. RNA synthesis would be reinitiated to complete the sg minus strand by adding the complement of the genomic leader sequence. Subsequently, the sg minus strand would be used as template for sg mRNA synthesis, and the presence of the leader complement at its 3\u00a2 end might allow the use of the same RNA signals that direct genome synthesis from the fulllength minus strand.",

However, base pairing is only one step of the nascent strand transfer process and is essential in both models outlined in Figure 1 .

Following transfection of the RNA into baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells, intracellular RNA is isolated and analysed by northern blot hybridization and RT\u00b1PCR (van Marle et al., 1999a) . Due to differences in transfection ef\u00aeciency, the total amount of virus-speci\u00aec RNA (genomic RNA and sg mRNA) isolated from transfected cell cultures is somewhat variable. Thus, the accurate quantitation of sg mRNA synthesis by TRS mutants requires an internal standard for transfection ef\u00aeciency. The amount of viral genomic RNA can be this standard, but only if its ampli\u00aecation is not dramatically affected by the TRS mutations. To prove that this is the case, we used the previously described mutants L4, B4 and LB4 (van Marle et al., 1999a) , in which \u00aeve nucleotides of the TRS (5\u00a2-UCAAC-3\u00a2) were replaced by the sequence 5\u00a2-AGUUG-3\u00a2, either in the leader TRS (L4), RNA7 body TRS (B4) or both TRSs (LB4).",

In that study, the role of TRS nucleotides C 2 and C 5 was tested by substituting them with G. It was concluded that base pairing between the sense leader TRS and the antisense body TRS plays a crucial role in nidovirus sg RNA synthesis. We now took a more systematic approach and performed an extensive site-directed co-variation mutagenesis study of the entire leader TRS and RNA7 body TRS, which directs the synthesis of the most abundant EAV sg RNA. Every nucleotide of the TRS (5\u00a2-UCA-ACU-3\u00a2) was replaced with each of the other possible nucleotides. As in the study of van Marle et al. (1999a) , every mutation was introduced into leader TRS, RNA7 body TRS and both TRSs, resulting in 54 mutant constructs. Each mutant was given a unique name: e.g. BU 1 A refers to a mutant in which a U has been changed to A at position 1 of the body TRS; LU 1 A refers to the same substitution in the leader TRS; and DU 1 A means that these two substitutions were combined in one double mutant construct. The amount of sg RNA7 was quantitated by phosphoimager scanning of hybridized gels and was corrected for the amount of genomic RNA in the same lane (as outlined above). Figure 3 shows the relative sg RNA7 level of the 54 mutants, compared with the RNA7 level of the wild-type control. For a selection of 11 interesting mutants (see below), the analysis was repeated three times (Figure 4 ), without observing signi\u00aecant variations in sg RNA synthesis.",

Remarkably, the effects of single (leader or body) TRS mutations were mostly base speci\u00aec, i.e. different nucleotide substitutions at the same position affected sg RNA7 synthesis to different extents. For example, at position 1, the BU 1 A mutant retained 44% of the wild-type RNA7 synthesis level, whereas both the BU 1 C and BU 1 G mutants lost RNA7 synthesis almost completely. Conversely, when U 1 of the leader TRS was changed to A or G, RNA7 synthesis was completely abolished, whereas 13% of the wild-type level was still maintained by LU 1 C. For position 2, only the BC 2 U mutant retained 30% of the wild-type RNA7 synthesis level, while all the other position 2 single mutants have lost 90% or more of wild-type RNA7 synthesis. Another example is position 6: BU 6 C left only 5% of wild-type RNA7 synthesis, whereas BU 6 A produced much higher RNA7 levels. This implied that for some positions (1, 2 and 6), certain mismatches in the duplex between plus leader TRS and minus body TRS, such as U\u00b1U (BU 1 A and BU 6 A) or C\u00b1A (LU 1 C and BC 2 U), are allowed to a limited extent. In contrast, no mismatches were allowed for position 5, where all single nucleotide substitutions abolished RNA7 synthesis almost completely. Surprisingly, both body TRS U to C substitutions at positions 1 and 6 (BU 1 C and BU 6 C) resulted in low levels of RNA7, despite the fact that these mutations allow the formation of a G\u00b1U base pair between the plus leader TRS, providing the U nucleotide, and the minus body TRS, providing the G. On the other hand, for positions 3 and 4, G\u00b1U base pairing was shown to be functional, because mutants LA 3 G and LA 4 G, which can form G\u00b1U base pairs between the G in the plus leader TRS and U in the minus body TRS, were the only position 3 and 4 single mutants that produced reasonable levels of RNA7. Taken together, these \u00aendings suggest that other factors, besides leader\u00b1 body base pairing, also play a role in sg RNA synthesis and that the primary sequence (or secondary structure) of TRSs may dictate strong base preferences at certain positions. Our analysis of the degree of complementation by the double mutants provided strong support for this assumption.",

This means that base pairing between these leader and body TRS nucleotides is involved in sg RNA synthesis. However, none of these double mutants reached the wild-type sg RNA7 level. In the other double mutants (all position 1, 3 and 4 mutants, and DU 6 C), in clear contradiction to the predictions of the`base pairing model', RNA7 synthesis was not signi\u00aecantly restored. Moreover, a comparison of the values for the B and D mutants in Figure 3 showed that, for almost all of these mutants (e.g. the position 1 mutants), the amount of sg RNA7 produced by the double mutant appeared to be limited by the level allowed by the body TRS mutation. Sometimes the RNA7 level of the double mutant was even less than that of the leader mutant (DU 1 C, DA 3 G, DA 4 G or DU 6 C). Clearly, for these substitutions, restoration of the possibilities for leader\u00b1body duplex formation did not restore sg RNA synthesis.

To interpret these base preferences accurately, it is necessary to limit the analysis to the double mutants only, because in these mutants the down-regulation of sg RNA synthesis was only due to the sequence changes in the body TRS, and not to the disruption of the leader\u00b1body TRS duplex. There were strict preferences for positions 1, 3 and 4 of the body TRS: at position 1, only the U to A substitution allowed for a signi\u00aecant RNA7 level (~40% of wild-type); and at positions 3 and 4, only the A to U mutants retained 15\u00b120% of the wild-type level.

At position 6 of the body TRS, only U to C was not allowed, whereas the other two double mutants still produced 50% or more of RNA7.

This model predicts that the TRSderived sequence that forms the leader\u00b1body junction in the sg mRNA is a copy of the body TRS, and not of the leader TRS. The leader-primed transcription model predicts the opposite ( Figure 1B) . Therefore, determining the origin of the leader\u00b1body junction of sg mRNAs would help to distinguish between the two models. However, in the wild-type situation, EAV leader and body TRSs are identical and consequently one cannot determine the origin of the sg mRNA leader\u00b1body junction. This problem could be overcome by tracing the mutations introduced in leader or RNA7 body TRS mutants, most of which retained part of their ability to produce mRNA7. In a previous study (van Marle et al., 1999a) , we found that nucleotides 2 and 5 of the mRNA7 leader\u00b1body junction sequence were derived exclusively from the body TRS, and not from the leader TRS. This was shown by direct sequencing of RT\u00b1PCR products obtained from the residual mRNA7 produced by mutants BC 2 G, LC 2 G, BC 5 G and LC 5 G ( van Marle et al., 1999a) .",

The most striking result was that mRNA7 of mutants BU 1 A, BU 1 G and LU 1 C contained exclusively the body TRS-derived nucleotide at position +1. Thus, for these mutants, the crossover site could be mapped precisely between TRS nucleotide positions \u00b11 and +1, meaning that the complete leader\u00b1 body junction sequence in an EAV sg mRNA can be body TRS derived. On the other hand, sg RNAs from mutants LU 1 A, BU 1 C and LU 1 G contained mixed populations of leader TRS-and body TRS-derived nucleotides at position +1 ( Figure 5 ): A and U for LU 1 A, C and U for BU 1 C, and G and U for LU 1 G. Remarkably, this pattern correlated with the relative amounts of sg mRNA7 produced by these mutants (Figure 3 ). Mutants that produced populations of sg RNAs that were mixed with respect to the origin of the nucleotide at position +1 of the leader\u00b1body junction had lost RNA7 synthesis almost completely. On the other hand, mutants that contained exclusively the body nucleotide at position +1 retained higher levels of RNA7 synthesis. This observation may be explained as follows: in the wild-type situation, the large majority of the crossovers probably occur between positions \u00b11 and +1, leading to a body TRS-derived nucleotide at position +1 in the sg RNA; however, a low number of crossovers take place between nucleotides +1 and +2, resulting in a leader TRS-derived nucleotide at position +1. Mutants in which almost all sg RNA synthesis is blocked by a substitution at position +1 may somehow be de\u00aecient in the crossover between \u00b11 and +1, but may have retained the ability for crossovers between +1 and +2, which were detected by sequence analysis. Conversely, in position +1 mutants that retain reasonable sg RNA synthesis, most crossovers occur between positions \u00b11 and +1, and they obscure the minority of crossovers between +1 and +2 in the sequencing electropherogram. Alternatively, position +1 TRS mutations that strongly interfere with sg RNA synthesis may force a shift of the crossover site in the remaining molecules.",

To explain the presence of a complete copy of the body TRS in the sg mRNA in this model, one would have to assume that a 3\u00a2\u00b15\u00a2 exonuclease activity trims back the free leader transcript prior to its extension into an sg mRNA (Baker and Lai, 1990) . Note that there would not be a single base pair left to hold these`trimmed' leader molecules on the template. Such an enzymatic activity, which is unprecedented in +RNA viruses, exists in yeast retrotransposon Ty5 (Ke et al., 1999) , in which reverse transcription is primed by an internal region in a tRNA. However, in this system, it is not a part of the duplex that is removed, but the single-stranded 3\u00a2 tail of the tRNA, which cannot base-pair with the Ty5 RNA.",

Sequence analysis of mRNA7 leader\u00b1body junctions from position 1 TRS mutants. Sequences were determined directly from sg mRNA7-speci\u00aec RT\u00b1PCR products. For the U 1 A and U 1 C mutants, the sequence shown corresponds to the plus strand of sg RNA7. For sequencing-related technical reasons, the minus strand sequence was determined for the U 1 G mutants; a mirror image of the electropherogram is shown with the corresponding plus strand sequence listed at the top of the panel. For every mutant, a sequence alignment of the leader (red) and body (blue) TRSs and surrounding sequences is shown (TRSs are boxed). The mRNA7 leader\u00b1body junctions detected by our sequence analysis are shown in yellow. duplex formed between the body TRS complement at the 3\u00a2 end of the leaderless sg minus strand and the leader TRS in the genomic RNA template should suf\u00aece to position the nascent minus strand properly for subsequent elongation to add the complement of the leader sequence. In most cases, the nascent minus strand contains the entire body TRS complement at its 3\u00a2 end at the moment of strand transfer, leading to a body TRS-derived leader\u00b1body junction sequence in the sg mRNA molecule. In a small number of transcripts, however, minus strand synthesis appears to be interrupted before nucleotide +1 of the body TRS is copied and, after strand transfer, resumes by incorporating the complement of the +1 nucleotide of the leader TRS. As stated above, we postulate that the detection of this phenomenon is determined by the level of crossovers between the \u00b11 and +1 position that is allowed by the mutations introduced at the +1 position of body TRS or leader TRS. We cannot, however, formally exclude that a`back trimming' activity degrades the 3\u00a2-terminal nucleotide of the minus strand before or after strand transfer. However, note that in the discontinuous minus strand extension model ( Figure 1C ), such an activity would not disturb the proper positioning of the nascent minus strand on the leader template, because the TRS\u00b1 TRS duplex would be shortened by one nucleotide only.",

While the only obvious function of the leader TRS is to ensure the \u00aedelity of the strand transfer by base pairing with the 3\u00a2 end of the nascent strand, the body TRS in the donor template indeed has additional, sequence-speci\u00aec functions. One of these functions apparently is to pause (or terminate) nascent strand synthesis and thereby provide the opportunity for strand transfer. In addition, body TRS-derived nucleotides may play a role in the reinitiation of nascent strand synthesis on the acceptor template. Given the compact nature of the EAV TRS, it is quite possible that some nucleotides ful\u00ael multiple tasks.",

For a number of +RNA viruses, RNA secondary structure motifs located in the (proximity of) sg RNA promoters are vital for sg RNA synthesis. In alfalfa mosaic virus (Haasnoot et al., 2000) , turnip crinkle virus (TCV) (Wang et al., 1999) and barley yellow dwarf virus (Koev et al., 1999) , stem\u00b1loop structures in sg RNA promoter regions of the template strand are required for sg RNA synthesis. The sg RNA1 promoter of the latter virus is especially interesting, since it contains two stem\u00b1loop domains. For one of them, secondary structure, but not the primary sequence, is important for sg RNA synthesis, whereas the other domain acts through primary sequence, and not secondary structure (Koev et al., 1999) . Similarly, RNA secondary structure may play only a minor role in the sequence-speci\u00aec recognition of the BMV sg RNA promoter by the RdRp Siegel et al., 1997) .",

At present, it is unknown whether EAV body TRSs are part of an RNA structural motif that is essential for body TRS function, or whether they are recognized by a protein factor in a sequence-speci\u00aec manner. However, the latter seems less likely than the former, since even LB4 (Figure 2 ), in which \u00aeve TRS nucleotides were substituted, still produced some sg RNA7, although~30-fold less than the wild-type control. The fact that some sequences in the EAV genome match the leader TRS perfectly, but are not used for sg mRNA synthesis, also argues against the recognition of a speci\u00aec sequence (Pasternak et al., 2000) . More probably, mutagenesis of the RNA7 body TRS disturbed an RNA structure that is necessary for its function. This could, for example, explain the fact that the BU 6 C substitution reduced the amount of RNA7 by 20-fold (and could not be rescued by the same mutation in the leader TRS), whereas the wild-type RNA6 body TRS contains a C at the same position. If a protein factor were involved in sequence-speci\u00aec TRS recognition, then one would expect it to recognize all TRSs similarly. If RNA structure is important for recognition by such a protein, then the BU 6 C substitution probably disturbs a structural motif of the RNA7 TRS, which is not present in the RNA6 TRS. On the other hand, conservation of part of the TRS in other arteriviruses suggests a sequence-speci\u00aec recognition. Further studies are required to distinguish between these possibilities.",

The hairpin has been postulated to bind the RdRp, whereas the homology region targets the nascent strand to the crossover site. The TCV RdRp probably recognizes the secondary and/or tertiary structure of the hairpin, while individual nucleotides play a less important role . In EAV, the leader TRS in the acceptor template is predicted to reside in the loop of an extensive hairpin, and its base pairing interaction with the body TRS complement at the 3\u00a2 end of the nascent minus strand would resemble certain antisense RNA-regulated control mechanisms that are based on interactions between single-stranded tails and hairpin loops (van Marle et al., 1999a, and references therein) . It is possible that the EAV RdRp, or its accessory proteins, also binds to the stem of the long hairpin that presents the leader TRS.

This protein would then mediate the pausing of the nascent strand synthesis and/or nascent strand transfer. This would resemble the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase I termination system, in which speci\u00aec DNA-binding terminator proteins bind to termination sequences (Reeder and Lang, 1997) , or a function of the HIV nucleocapsid protein, which promotes the minus strand strong-stop DNA transfer (Guo et al., 1997) . The EAV replicase component nsp1, which recently was shown to possess an sg RNA synthesis-speci\u00aec activity (Tijms et al., 2001) , may be a good candidate for such a regulatory role. Residues predicted to form a zinc \u00aenger structure in nsp1 were shown to be necessary for sg RNA synthesis. Interestingly, zinc \u00aenger structures in the HIV nucleocapsid protein facilitate strand transfer (Guo et al., 2000) . Finally, it should be noted that the RNA structure of the nascent strand may also in\u00afuence pausing, strand transfer or reinitiation, as illustrated by the fact that stable hairpin structures in the nascent strand promote termination of transcription by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (Wilson and von Hippel, 1995) .",
