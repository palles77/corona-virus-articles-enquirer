            "text": "The air transportation industry in the US has undergone significant restructuring since 2001. While adjustments in costs have been the focus of the industry, changes in the demand structure have also occurred. This paper analyses the structure and dynamics of the origin and destination of core air travel market demand using 1995-2006 US quarterly time-series data. Despite the industry consolidating its network following the terrorist attacks of 2001, passenger travels in core markets have exhibited strong growth in recent years. This increase was driven mostly by the gains in the larger markets. When segmented by types of markets, super-thin markets are seen to have lost services while other markets gained. A majority of passengers use the thick markets that account for only a small portion of all markets and their demand has continued to grow. Relatively fewer passengers fly in the thin and super-thin markets, but they account for a substantial portion of all markets. Empirical estimates align well with the events and adjustments that have been experienced during the time series we examined. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

Over 750 million passengers used the US commercial aviation system in 2006, 1 and this number is forecast to exceed one billion by 2015 (Federal Aviation Administration, 2007a ). This expansion is particularly noticeable given the economic slowdown in early 2001, the terrorist attacks in September 2001, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003, the start of Iraq war, rapid expansion of videoconferencing, and the increase in jet fuel prices. Many legacy air carriers entered bankruptcy protection during the last few years, while several merged and contracted their network to ride out the extraordinary changes. Although the industry is still in the process of transition, the resulting effect of the restructuring has led to a resiliency that few had anticipated. After persistent losses since 2001 that amounted to in excess of $50 billion, the industry in 2006 appears to be poised for expansion in the near future.",

Much has been written on the commercial airlines' responses to the terrorist events of 2001 (Ito and Lee, 2004) but our understanding of the nature and changing dynamics of air travel demand in the US is still limited. In particular, demand responses to fare changes has been little explored in a time-series context with the exception of Lee (2003) . Additionally, the network retrenchment that had caused some small communities to lose direct services has not been adequately addressed. Furthermore, the functioning of larger passenger markets is not well understood. Finally, the overall US economy has gone through major structural changes during the last few years but little research has been done to link these to commercial air travel- Irwin and Kasarda (1991) and Button et al. (1999) are exceptions.",

Deviations from the summer quarters of respective years demonstrate the nature of seasonality in US air travel (Fig. 1) . The brief economic slowdown of the spring of 2001 and effect of September 11 on core markets waned from 2003, with a brief slowdown in 2005. In 2006, the market expansion appears to have slowed as the industry experienced major restructuring due to a merger (post-bankruptcy US Airways and America West) and the filing for bankruptcy protection by three legacy air carriers (i.e., Delta, United, Northwest). This observation lends some support that bankruptcy leads to decline in service levels (Borenstein and Rose, 2003) . Although there were almost 1500 market pairs dropped between 2002 and 2006, the passengers increased in the core markets (Fig. 2) . Despite a sustained increase in fares starting in the summer of 2005 and continuing into 2 Core demand for air travel is assumed to be supported by the economic and demographic conditions in the origin and destination communities. Changes in this demand are thus primarily led by factors that are external to air carriers. Peripheral or segment demand for air travel results from factors that air carriers are able to influence.

However, in the present environment of digital communications and the Internet, this correlation may not hold for smaller communities. There is evidence indicating that the extent of this association may be loosening. 13 Nonetheless, we perform the formal test of multicollinearity among the explanatory variables. 14 We find the standard errors associated with the proposed explanatory variables are small and stable across sub-samples. The condition indices, 15 however, appear to be larger than usually suggested. Furthermore, the variance inflation factor (VIF)-proportion of the variance of the estimates accounted for by each principal component-exceeds 10, a common measure to diagnose multicollinearity. The population variables are removed as a way to handle multicollinearity in the sub-samples. 16 Table 2 presents the aggregate characteristics of the sample without yearly/quarterly and market-type classifications. It also provides Pearson correlation coefficients for the non-logarithmic variables. Empirical evidence on this is not conclusive. Using data from the MSAs and an empirical framework, Glaeser (1998) demonstrates that while conventional reasoning of minimizing transport cost may no longer justify the existence of cities (due to declining manufacturing base), cities still continue to attract specialized labor and new ideas. Forman et al. (2003) , on the other hand, demonstrate that urban leadership in technology adoption may not explain the variations in technology adoption across locations. Dispersion may, in fact, spread if sharing of technological resources can be resolved. 14 Due to the space limitations, we do not report these results. 15 Condition indices can be generated via regression procedure in SAS. First, the X'X matrix (i.e., matrix containing explanatory variables) is scaled to have 1 s as the diagonal elements. Following this, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated. The condition indices are the square roots of the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to each individual eigenvalue. The largest condition index is the condition number of the scaled X matrix and when this number is around 10, weak dependencies may begin to impact the regression parameters. When the index is larger than 100, a considerable number of numerical errors may exist. 16 Since Census counts are conducted once every decade, population in MSAs are ''constructed'' by mid-decade surveys, extrapolation, and economic variables, such as income. This observation, in addition to the existence of statistical multicollinearity, led us to drop population as an explanatory variable. Fig. 6 relates the explanatory power of the specified model by types of markets for 192 sub-samples (i.e., years and quarters that are represented along the horizontal axis). The demand specification appears to capture thick markets fairly well. Over 60% of the variations in the passenger in core thick markets appear to have been explained by average fares, real personal incomes of origin and destination markets, and distances between origin and destination markets. Alternatively, the specified model does not explain around 40% of the observed variations in passenger data. The explanatory powers gradually decline between 2001 and 2003, due to 9/11, the Iraq war, SARS, etc., that are outside the model. The model also tends to lose its explanatory power a little during Q1 on a systematic basis suggesting there are omitted seasonal variables.",

However, it does not hold for routes without the LCC competition. 0.5% passenger adjustment in thin markets, it generates only a half of that in semi-thick markets. As noted earlier, many of the semi-thick markets are closely linked through the airline hub-and-spoke networks and often dominated by a single carrier and its code-sharing partners. Air travelers in many of these markets may have very few choices thus resulting in demand that is inelastic in fare. Alternatively, thin markets that are large enough to stand on their own or not part of any one dominated career's network pay a slightly higher fare but may find many more alternatives (i.e., more than twice the elasticity value vis-a`vis semi-thick markets). These markets are beginning to exhibit momentum in gaining value in fare elasticity (Fig. 8) . Together, these facts perhaps indicate that the next web of airline competition is likely to take place in thin markets as opposed to semi-thick markets. Overall, the ranges of elasticities fall within the values that have been observed elsewhere (see Brons, et al. (2002) for an intracountry meta analysis).",

Since semi-thick markets offer far fewer alternatives, people's decisions are likely to be less sensitive to income (with estimated magnitudes o0.1). This, combined with the fact that they are also fare inelastic, tends to represent very little demand-pull from these communities. Air travel is thus a strong necessity for many of the travelers in communities that are represented by semi-thick markets. In comparison, passengers living in thin markets, with similar real incomes, have relatively more alternatives. Thus, their decisions to travel are relatively more sensitive to changes in real income than those living in semi-thick markets, resulting in almost twice in the magnitude of income elasticity coefficients, still falling within the realm of inelasticity. Following the same logic, one can also understand the rationale behind even higher income elasticities for those living in thick markets; more alternatives accompanied with higher real incomes result in relatively higher elasticity.",

To understand this finding, one has to take into account both the spatio-locations and income distributions in the super-thin markets. For most cases, these markets are constituted by the suburban and peripheral areas that are outside the main urban centers of the MSAs. 19 Generally speaking, these areas are scattered in the US. However, the locations of their employment and the accounting of their contributions make these smaller communities demonstrate economic behaviors resembling more like larger communities. Thus, while passengers in these small communities are restricted by access to scheduled air travels, their decisions to travel by air are influenced more by their incomes which override the access constraints, thus resulting in elasticities that are closer to those for thick markets.",

Relatively higher income elasticities combined with very inelastic fare elasticities ( Fig. 8) for super-thin markets are potentially attractive to providers exploring alternative networks. The decision of air taxi providers using very light jets to serve many of these communities (e.g., DayJet) perhaps indicates such potential. Larger size of the markets combined with intense competitive forces make it harder to draw such attraction to thick markets. Thus, these super-thin markets that are relatively responsive to income changes and irresponsive to fare changes are indeed potentially attractive markets for introduction of new lines of air-travel products. The high cost of operating scheduled air carrier network makes servicing these smaller markets difficult.",

In Fig. 11 , we report these elasticities (vertical axis) by market types and year and quarter (horizontal axis). 21 At the fringes of the MSAs, many of the communities are bedroom communities. Although their core economies are small, populations living in them resemble those in thick markets and large MSAs in terms of economic behaviors. Furthermore, a large part of their economic contributions, and especially income are accounted for by the locations of their employment in large MSAs. Due to scattered locations, their choices are restricted by the access to scheduled air services compared to those living in larger communities. 20 All are statistically significant at 99% levels for all 192 sub-samples. 21 Unlike other variables, parameters for distance did not meet 99% confidence levels in 46 sub-samples. Most lower levels of confidence were Overall, O&D travels from these markets do not necessarily invoke proportional increases in passenger flow. 22 Controlling for fares, this would imply that there are limited demand responses among the travelers for further distanced market pair services. While thick and thin markets demonstrated somewhat upward mobility and thus greater responses (within the range of inelasticity) in the distance elasticities, especially after 2001:Q3, it remains virtually constant for the other two markets. These results compare well with our earlier discussion on gaining new market pair services by market categories. If these trends continue in the future, thick and thin markets would indeed have greater opportunities for newer and distant city pair services than semi-thick and super-thin market pair services.",
