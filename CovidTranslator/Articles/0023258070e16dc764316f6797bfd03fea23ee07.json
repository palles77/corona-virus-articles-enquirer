Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study in childcare centres and a general practice in Sydney, Australia. Using PAR-ENT-QoL, we measured QoL of parents of children aged 6 months-3 years before the 2010 influenza season, then again for parents of children with ILI (ILI group) using SF-12v2 Acute Form and PAR-ENT-QoL, and contemporaneously for parents of aged-matched children without ILI (non-ILI group).",

PAR-ENT-QoL scores of the ILI group were significantly lower in the post-ILI follow-up interviews than at baseline (60.99 vs. 79.77, p \\ 0.001), and those of non-ILI group at follow-up interviews (60.99 vs. 84.05, p \\ 0.001). SF-12v2 scores of the ILI group were also significantly lower than those of non-ILI group: physical component summary (50.66 vs. 53.16, p = 0.011) and mental component summary (45.67 vs. 53.66, p \\ 0.001). Two factors were significantly associated with parental QoL: total time spent caring child during ILI and whether the child had severe ILI or not. Correlations between PAR-ENT-QoL and SF-12v2 scores were satisfactory. Conclusions Parents had significantly lower QoL while their child had ILI, compared with before ILI and with parents of children without ILI. The public health impact of ILI in children on the QoL in families is far from negligible. QoL measurement can complement economic evaluation of ILI disease burden and provide a more complete picture of impact.",

PAR-ENT-QoL was developed in French and has been culturally adapted in Italian, German, Portuguese, and Czech [25, 26] . We used the English version of PAR-ENT-QoL provided by the questionnaire developers; however, this version had not yet been validated at the time of our study. The PAR-ENT-QoL questionnaire has 15 items regarding the extent of parents' worry, stress, mood, quality of sleep, time for family members, outings and leisure, medical expenses, and perceived QoL in general during the preceding 2 weeks. Items were rated using a five-point Likert scale, and ratings were then reversed so that the scoring direction was consistent with the SF-12v2 Acute Form (i.e. a higher score represented better QoL). The items in the PAR-ENT-QoL questionnaire are categorised in two domains (Emotional and Daily Disturbance); the domain scores were calculated by adding up the scores (1-5) of items from the corresponding domain. The domain scores were then linearly transformed (ranging from 0 to 100). The Total score was calculated by adding up the two domain scores and dividing by two [26] .",

The SF-12v2 Acute Form is similar to the standard SF-12v2, the only difference being that it has a one-week recall period instead of 4 weeks. It covers eight domains: physical functioning (moderate activity, climbing stairs); role physical (accomplished less, limited in activities); bodily pain; general health; vitality (lot of energy); social functioning (interference in social activities); role emotional (accomplished less, less careful); and mental health (felt calm, downhearted). The scores for the first four domains were grouped into a ''physical component summary'', and the scores for the last four domains were grouped into a ''mental component summary'' [27] . The raw scores obtained were linearly z-score transformed into a 0-100 scale using this formula: [(actual raw score-lowest possible raw score)/possible raw score range] 9 100, such that the transformation converts the lowest and highest possible scores to 0 and 100, respectively [27] . A higher score indicated a higher QoL. The SF-12v2 Acute Form domain and summary scores were converted to norm-based scores using software from the Medical Outcomes Trust and QualityMetric Incorporated.

Affected aspects included emotions and social life. Findings from the SF-12v2 Acute Form also demonstrated that when a child has ILI, the emotional component of the parent's QoL was worse than that of the general US population in 1998 [27] , whereas when a child did not have ILI, the emotional and physical components of the parent's QoL were better than those of the US population in 1998 [27] . Significant physical impact on QoL was also observed but to a lesser extent than emotional impact, findings supported by both PAR-ENT-QoL and the SF-12v2 Acute Form. We did not observe significant differences in QoL during the first and second ILI episodes for parents of children having more than one ILI episode. However, given that there were only 16 children with more than one ILI episode, the similar extent of QoL impact in those with one ILI episode versus multiple episodes may be due to chance only.",

This was to be expected as parents having to spend more time to care for the child, or the child's ILI being severe, would be more disruptive to normal routines; for example, sleep disturbances and reduced social activities were among the factors rated by parents as having the largest impact on parental QoL. Another study has shown a decrease in parental QoL if the child's communityacquired pneumonia was more severe [29] . Demographic factors of the parent and the child with ILI were not associated with QoL. The total variance explained in the regression model, however, was not high (25 %), suggesting that QoL could be a complex concept influenced by many factors, which would require more in-depth analysis of parents' QoL changes resulting from their experiences.",

We know of no published studies on the QoL of caregivers of children with ILI or influenza. Yet, children with influenza are at risk of developing complications such as otitis media and pneumonia [5] . Three studies have shown the negative impact of otitis media and community-acquired pneumonia on parental stress and family functioning [29, 35, 36] . The types of impact and the extent are consistent with what we found in this study and in a qualitative study based on the same sample [25] . Furthermore, although the impact of ILI on the child and family is generally short-lived, it is a common experience. In population terms, the density of impact is substantial and, as countries consider the cost-effectiveness of adding influenza to routine childhood vaccination schedules, it is important to consider the impact on quality of life of affected families to enable a holistic assessment of disease burden.",
