In this study, we report on the antiviral evaluation of ferruginol (1) and several analogues synthesized from commercial (\u00fe)-dehydroabietylamine. Thus, the activity against Human Herpesvirus type 1, Human Herpesvirus type 2 and Dengue Virus type 2, was studied. Two ferruginol analogues showed high antiviral selectivity index and reduced viral plaque-size in post-infection stages against both Herpes and Dengue viruses. A promising lead, compound 8, was ten-fold more potent (EC 50 \u00bc 1.4 mM) than the control ribavirin against Dengue Virus type 2. Our findings suggest that the 12-hydroxyabieta-8,11,13-triene skeleton, which is characteristic of the diterpenoid ferruginol (1), is an interesting molecular scaffold for development of novel antivirals. In addition, the cytotoxic and antifungal activities of the synthesized ferruginol analogues have also been investigated.",

            "text": "Human Herpesvirus (HHV) types 1 and 2 are enveloped DNA viruses characterized for producing latent infection in sensory neurons and reactivation during periods of severe immunosuppression of the host. Many factors such as stress, fatigue, sexual relations with people who have active lesions, excess exposure to heat or cold, fever, laser treatments, local tissue trauma and nerve damage, can predispose to reactivation, especially in neonates, transplant and immunocompromised patients which tend to present aggressive and recurrent lesions [1] . Also, it has been reported that prolonged therapy with Acyclovir (ACV), and its analogues, has induced the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains. Human Herpesvirus predominantly develops resistance, almost 95%, as a result of mutations in the genes that encode the viral thymidine kinase (TK) [2] . However, mutations in the viral DNA polymerase can also cause this resistance. In immunocompromised patients, the presence of HHV species resistant to ACV, with a prevalence of 4e10%, has complicated their clinical management [3] . Moreover, Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped ssRNA virus. To date, there have been described four serotypes established in humans (DENV-1 to DENV-4) and recently, a fifth Dengue subtype that follows the sylvatic cycle has been identified [4] . Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne disease worldwide, since it is distributed over one hundred countries of the tropical belt and the tropics, both the Old and New World [5] . Disease manifestations cover a wide spectrum ranging from dengue with or without warning signs to severe dengue in which plasma leakage, haemorrhage and organ impairment can lead to death. In addition, unusual manifestations such as cardiomyopathy, liver failure and neurological disorders have been reported [6] . The major problem of this pathology is that there are no drugs approved for human treatment or vaccine available for prophylaxis. Also, antiviral drugs addressed to specific genes or proteins of the virus are not a good alternative due to the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, often because viral mutants are selected for drug resistance [7] . During the last years in Colombia, several reports had shown the high rates of evolution of DENV, possibly related with the new Asiatic-American genotypes found in Colombia and Brazil [8] .",

A fullerene diterpenoid hybrid was also envisaged as potential inhibitor [14] . Herein, we describe the antiviral activity of ferruginol (1) and some analogues (5e14) (Scheme 1) synthesized from dehydroabietylamine (3) against HHV-1 and HHV-2, and DENV-2. Our aim is to identify new antiviral drug candidates which act on cellular and/or molecular targets instead on viral proteins. In this way, the concerns about the viral mutants resistant to the treatments can be avoided.

Compounds 1 and 5e9 were synthesized as reported in the literature using a FriedeleCrafts acylation and a BaeyereVilliger oxidation as key steps [16] . Then, compound 6 was used as starting material for the preparation of compounds 10 and 11. Later, compound 11 was converted into compounds 12e14 as described recently in the literature [17] . Thus, the synthesis starts with the introduction of the phthalimide group on (\u00fe)-dehydroabietylamine (3), followed by FriedeleCrafts acylation and oxidation under Baeyer-Villiger conditions to afford acetate 5 in 72% overall yield. Hydrolysis of the acetate group in 5 gave phenol 8 in high yield, while overall deprotection of 5 afforded the aminophenol 6 in 75% yield. Compound 6 was the intermediate of three separate approaches. Firstly, tosylation under standard conditions gave compound 7 in 90% yield. Secondly, oxidative deamination of 6 gave 18-oxoferruginol (9) in moderate yield (50%), which was converted into ferruginol (1) by Wolff-Kishner reduction (90% yield). And finally, the treatment of 6 with tetrachlorophthalic anhydride (TCPA) afforded phenol 10 in 75% yield, which was acetylated with acetic anhydride in pyridine to give acetate 11 in quantitative yield. Acetate 11 was oxidized at C-7 with excess of t-BuOOH as oxidant and CrO 3 /pyridine mixture as a catalyst in DCM, the yield of ketone 12 was 66%. Subsequently, the reaction of 12 with p-tosylhydrazide yielded the corresponding p-tosylhydrazone 13 (77% yield). The fullerene-terpenoid hybrid 14 was obtained by the treatment with NaOMe of 13 in anhydrous pyridine for 20 min at room temperature followed by addition of a solution of C 60 in chlorobenzene and heating at 70 C for 24 h. This gave compound 14 in ca. 30% yield. All the compounds showed spectroscopic data in agreement with the assigned structures and purity >95%.",

            "text": "Several molecular and cellular components involved in Herpesvirus cell-to-cell spread have been previously reported. For example, viral glycoproteins such as E and M play a relevant role in normal viral plaque phenotype of HHV-1, because the plaque size of the double-deletion mutant (DgEgM) reduced over 5-fold less than wild type strain [26] . In polarized epithelial cells, Johnson and coworkers demonstrated by electron microscopy, that the gE/gI glycoproteins complex is necessary to accumulate virions at cell junctions, since mutants that not express gE glycoprotein leads to particles accumulation more frequently on apical surfaces. Thus, they concluded that the gE/gI complex is required to sort selectively HHV-1 particles to lateral surfaces and specifically to cell junctions [27] . On the other hand, structures containing actin and tubulin during Herpesviruses infection have the ability to project virions towards adjacent cells. Additionally, both the membrane composition and cytoskeletal structures of egress sites are modified during infection in non-polarized cells [28] . According to the findings of Dixit and co-workers, HHV-1 also promotes cytoskeletal rearrangements that facilitate viral spread in vitro, including dramatic increases of filopodia in cultured neurons [29] . Multiple and convergent ways by which several viruses such as Vaccinia, Hepatitis B and C viruses, Human Immunodeficiency virus, Human Tlymphotropic virus, Murine leukemia virus and HHV cause subversion of cytoskeleton for different objectives in viral cycle are summarized by Taylor and co-workers [30] . The actin cytoskeleton is reorganized by these viruses affecting every stage of the viral life cycle, from entry through assembly to egress. Using immunochemical assays, drug inhibition assays and protein interaction profiling methods, Wang and co-workers identified the ways in which DENV-2 interacts with actin cytoskeleton. This study showed that dynamic treadmilling of actin is necessary for Dengue virus entry, production and release, indicating a direct effect of viral E protein on the structural modifications of actin cytoskeleton [31] .",

Nonetheless, other experiments are required to confirm this hypothesis. Although it is very risky assure that some viral or cellular component are involved in our findings, the study of ferruginol analogues will be an important tool from medicinal chemistry for dissecting these complicated cellular and molecular processes of the viral infections. In the future, this research will be routed to understanding of some cellular and molecular mechanisms where, two very different viruses (Herpesvirus and Dengue), are converging in a conserved evolutionary pathway during cell infection, affecting cytoskeleton elements, endomembrane system and signaling pathways involved in viral egress from the host-cells and spreading infection toward neighbor cells.",

Controls were included untreated cells, cells treated with compounds and cells infected with DENV-2. As positive control we used Ribavirin. Compounds were considered active against DENV-2 if has the ability to reduce or avoid the cytopathic effect during viral infection. This assay was conducted by quadruplicate and repeated twice for each compound.

Vero cell monolayers grown in 24-well plates (2.5 \u00c2 10 4 cells/ well) were infected with 100 PFU per well of each virus. Treatments were performed by adding compounds either simultaneously with virus (pre-infection treatment) or after viral infection (post-infection treatment). For pre-infection treatment, a virus/compound mixture was added to cell monolayers and was incubated for 1 h at 37 C (5% CO 2 ). After incubation, washing was performed with PBS (pH \u00bc 7.0) and added CMC 1%, 0.75% and 2% for HHV-1, HHV-2 and DENV-2, respectively.

EC 50 for each compound were obtained from doseeeffect curves for linear regression methods using the statistical GraphPad Prisma 5.0 and EC 50 values are expressed as the mean of at least four dilutions by quadruplicate.

The MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma, New Jersey, USA) assay, according to the protocol previously described [12c] with few modifications, was used. Briefly, Vero and HeLa cells were plated at 2.0 \u00c2 10 4 cells per well in a 96well flat-bottomed plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 C. Moreover, Jurkat and U937 cells were plated at 3.0 \u00c2 10 4 cells per well in a 96well round-bottomed plate. Then each diluted compound was added to the appropriate wells and the plates were incubated for further 48 h at 37 C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 . Finally, spectrophotometric reading was carried out at 570 nm to determine the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50 ), defined as the concentration for each compound that inhibits 50% of cell growth. The IC 50 values for each compound were obtained by linear regression analysis of the doseeresponse curves generated from the absorbance data with the statistical GraphPad Prisma 5.0. IC 50 values were expressed as the geometric mean of two independent experiments done in quadruplicate. To define which compounds were more selective to cancerous cells than to non-cancerous cells, it was calculated selectivity index (SI) defined as Vero IC 50 over HeLa, Jurkat or U937 IC 50. A compound with an IC 50 < 30 mM was considered active and with a SI ! 5 was considered selective.",

The filamentous fungi F. oxysporum (ATCC 48112), A. fumigatus (ATCC 204305), A. flavus (ATCC 204304), A. terreus (CDC 317) and dermatophytes, T. rubrum (ATCC 28188) and T. mentagrophytes (ATCC 24198) were used to evaluate antifungal activity at inoculum size of 0.2e2.5 \u00c2 10 5 CFU/mL. The yeasts C. albicans (ATCC 1023), C. parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) and C. tropicalis (ATCC 200956) were used to evaluate antifungal activity at inoculum size of 1e5 \u00c2 10 5 CFU/mL. The dilutions of compounds were dispensed into 96-well flatbottom microdilution plates in duplicate at final concentrations between 50 mg/mL and 3.125 mg/mL. The compounds were considered active when they exhibited MIC values 50 mg/mL. For the CLSI M38-A method, the MIC were defined as the lowest dilution that resulted in an 80% of inhibition of visible growth after incubation at 28 C to 48 h to F. oxysporum and 6 days to dermatophytes. Amphotericine B was evaluated, at a range of 0.031e16 mg/mL, with the strains A. fumigatus (ATCC 204305) and A. flavus (ATCC 204304) and Terbinafine was used as positive control at a range of 0.0078e4 mg/mL on both dermatophytes. For the AFST-EUCAST method, the MIC was determined after 24 h of incubation at 35 C and defined as the lowest concentration that resulted in 90% of reduction of growth. Itraconazole was used as positive control at final concentrations of 0.031e16 mg/mL. A negative control (inoculum without treatment) was also included. MIC values were expressed as geometric mean (GM-MIC) of tests performed in duplicate in three different assays against each fungi species.",
