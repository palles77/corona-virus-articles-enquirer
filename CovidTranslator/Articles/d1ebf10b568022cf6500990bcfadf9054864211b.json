            "text": "The ability to use double-stranded RNA to inhibit gene expression sequence-specifically (RNA interference, or RNAi) is currently revolutionizing science and medicine alike. Numerous pre-clinical studies are evaluating RNAi as a novel therapeutic modality in the battle against gain-of-function autosomal dominant diseases, cancer, and viral infections. One emerging concern is that RNAi mono-therapies might ultimately fail to control viruses that can escape silencing by mutation and/or RNAi suppression. Thus, sophisticated strategies are being developed that aim to avert viral resistance by combining RNAi effectors with each other or with further gene expression inhibitors. Several reports already validate this new concept of \"combinatorial RNAi\" (coRNAi) and illustrate its versatility by describing co-expression of RNAi triggers directed against single or multiple, viral or cellular, targets. Other studies document the successful delivery of these triggers with additional RNA-or protein-based silencers. Moreover, vectors have been engineered to blend RNAi-mediated gene inhibition with conventional gene replacement strategies. Collectively, these efforts open up exciting new therapeutic avenues but could also augment the inherent risks of RNAi technology, including immune responses, off-targeting, and oversaturation of endogenous pathways. Here, we critically review all coRNAi strategies and discuss the requirements for their transition into clinical application.",

            "text": "The reasons for the persistence of human viruses and the emergence of new infectious diseases are complex. Key is the extensive variation and flexibility of viral genomes, resulting from a combination of minimal generation times, notoriously inaccurate reproduction, and intra-host recombination. Viruses thus have a substantial genetic advantage over their human hosts in the evolutionary \"molecular arms race. \" This particularly applies to RNA viruses such as HCV, whose RNA-dependent RNA polymerase incorporates the extreme number of 10 3 mutations per viral nucleotide per year (or eight per genome, 100-fold higher than for HBV, a DNA virus). 1 Even more worrisome is the rate of 0.2 errors and three recombination events per HIV genome per replication cycle, making it one of the fastest evolving of all organisms. 3 Coupled with a logarithmic expansion in the infected host, producing up to 10 12 new particles each day, this exerts intense pressure on the natural immune system to control the infection. Further shifting the balance of power is the fact that many viruses exist in genetically distinct quasi-species and subtypes and/or have developed \"stealth and cunning\" mechanisms to out-maneuver or evade the innate and adaptive immune response. 4 Unfortunately, our existing treatment options for viral infections are usually ineffective and very limited. For instance, success rates for HCV are at best 50-60%, even using combinations of the most efficient regimens (pegylated interferon-\u03b1 and ribavarin). 1 Moreover, there is no preventive recombinant vaccine for the virus, or for HIV (two vaccines showed no efficacy in recent phase III clinical trials). The latter is perhaps the most frustrating candidate for development of an anti-viral therapy, as single-drug (e.g., azidothymidine) strategies readily result in the evolution of multiply drug-resistant strains. Even a combination of drugs (highly active anti-retroviral therapies) can typically only delay the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, not rid the body",

            "text": "One particularly promising and powerful recent addition to our arsenal of anti-viral weapons is RNA interference, or RNAi. Hailed as \"Scientific breakthrough of the year (2002)\" by the journal Science 5 and honored with the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Andrew Z. Fire and Craig C. Mello), RNAi is a natural phenomemon of gene silencing by small duplex RNAs. Originally discovered in plants and nematodes, 6 RNAi is now known to be conserved through evolution up to humans, although it might serve different purposes in different species. It likely constitutes the main innate anti-viral defense in plants (and worms and flies), 7 yet its primary role in mammals and humans might be the processing of micro RNAs (miRNAs), small regulatory non-coding RNAs. 8 Hundreds of miRNAs are encoded in the human genome, many being transcribed in a spatio-temporal manner. 9 Following expression as long pri-miRNAs, they are processed by the nuclear enzyme Drosha into shorter pre-miRNAs and then transported into the cytoplasm (via Exportin-5). There, the adenosine triphosphate-dependent RNAse III-like Dicer enzyme generates even shorter (approximately 21 nt) double-stranded RNAs, the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Their role is to guide the RNAinduced silencing complex to a homologous messenger RNA (mRNA) and induce either its cleavage or translational repression (depending on the siRNA-mRNA sequence complementarity). 10 The extreme efficiency and specificity of this process make RNAi highly attractive for anti-viral therapies. A particular benefit over conventional approaches is that RNAi is an innate cellular pathway, requiring only the introduction of a trigger for its activation, which should minimize the side effects. Importantly, the nature of this trigger can vary and be tailored to the viral target and its unique life cycle. 11, 12 One option well suited to preventing or treating acute infection and providing immediate effects is topical application of siRNAs. However, their use might naturally be limited to mucosal tissues or localized and accessible sites of viral infection (e.g., the respiratory and female genital tracts and the eye). 11 Notable recently reported siRNA applications include protection of mice against lethal infection with herpes simplex virus-2 13 and treatment of acute respiratory syncytial virus infection (a leading cause of child death). 14 The latter application is currently being evaluated in a phase I clinical trial. Conversely, a gene therapy approach involving delivery of RNAi expression cassettes is more appropriate for treatment of chronic infections such as HBV, HCV, and HIV. 1 Typically, the trigger is a miRNAlike sequence (derived from a natural miRNA 15 or an artificial short hairpin RNA (shRNA)) under the control of an RNA polymerase II or III promoter. These cassettes are small and thus readily incorporated into any of the established gene therapy vectors, such as lentiviruses and AAVs (adeno-associated viruses). For instance, we have recently used the latter (AAV serotype 8) to express an anti-HBV shRNA in livers of HBV-transgenic mice, resulting in efficient and persistent viral suppression. 16 Another general advantage of RNAi as an anti-viral therapy is that triggers with perfect viral sequence complementarity induce target cleavage. In particular, for positive-strand RNA viruses (e.g., HIV, HCV, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), this offers the possibility not only to suppress the pathogen but actually to eradicate it from the host. 11, 12 Last but not least, RNAi silencing requires a minimal target of only 19-21 nt, which might be sufficient to co-suppress related viral isolates.

Paradoxically, in this regard, the sequence specificity of RNAi turns into a disadvantage: a single nucleotide change in the target can abolish mRNA degradation and provide the viral mutant with a growth advantage under RNAi pressure. This has already been illustrated by a variety of reports. Among the first, Gitlin et al. noted that prolonged incubation of poliovirusinfected, siRNA-treated cells resulted in enrichment of an RNAiresistant point mutant. 19, 20 Identical findings were documented for HCV when Randall et al. reported loss of siRNA activity against genotype 1b in a mutant virus differing by only 3 nt. 21 Wilson and Richardson validated the fact that subtle changes are indeed sufficient to permit viral escape by showing that successive mono-siRNA treatment of HCV replicon cell lines led to multiple point mutations in the HCV genome and loss of siRNA function. 22 The same phenomenon was found consistently for HIV and first reported by Boden et al., who isolated a point mutant after constant HIV-1 growth on anti-tat shRNA-expressing T cells. 23 HIV's propensity to escape was confirmed by Das et al. 24 and by Lee et al., 17 who identified the emergence of nef or gag mutants under RNAi pressure. Interestingly, Westerhout et al. realized that HIV sporadically escapes through mutations that alter the local genome secondary structure, as opposed to single nucleotide changes. 25 Regardless of mechanism, the high propensity to rapid escape mutation, combined with the high natural genetic diversity, makes finding a single conserved and efficient viral target sequence almost impossible.",

            "text": "A second problem with RNAi mono-therapies is that the interaction of human viruses with their hosts might be far more complex than originally thought. [26] [27] [28] Contrary to the initial belief that RNAi is not part of the human innate anti-viral immune response, growing evidence now suggests the existence of virally encoded \"suppressors of RNAi silencing\" (SRSs). This should not be surprising, as double-stranded RNA is often generated during viral replication, exposing the virus to host RNAi and likely exerting pressure to evolve an anti-RNAi counter-mechanism. It is fascinating, however, to learn how many different approaches human viruses might have taken to developing SRSs (which are frequent among plant and insect viruses 7 ). The first mammalian examples were the influenza NS1 and vaccinia E3L proteins, which might counteract the RNAi pathway via non-specific sequestering of double-stranded RNA, thus competing for Dicer substrates. 29 However, their main function is inhibition of protein kinase R, and RNAi suppression has been shown only in non-vertebrate cells thus far. Adenovirus-encoded virus-associated RNAs, short miRNA-like molecules accumulating to 10 8 copy numbers per infected cell, are another example. 30 Recent studies suggest that virus-associated RNAs can out-compete the Exportin-5-mediated translocation of endogenous miRNAs, and in addition competitively suppress Dicer activity. 31, 32 Similarly, it was proposed that the HCV core and the HIV Tat proteins inhibit RNAi via Dicer binding. 33, 34 HIV might also attenuate RNAi via a second mechanism-sequestering of trans-activating response RNA-binding protein (an essential RNA-induced silencing complex component) through its trans-activation response region element. 35 On the other hand, it is striking to note that some human viruses hijack the RNAi machinery to carry out their own replication strategies, which might seem counterintuitive. [26] [27] [28] One remarkable example is again HCV, which subverts a liver-specific miRNA (miR-122) for its gene expression. 36 Moreover, other viruses were recently found to encode their own miRNAs, albeit in most cases (e.g., HIV or Epstein-Barr virus) without evidence for functional or genetic significance. 34, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] An exception is an SV40-encoded miRNA whose function appears to be inhibition of the SV40 T antigens late in infection, to reduce the susceptibility of the virus to, and activation of, cytotoxic T lymphocytes. 42",

This novel approach, comparable to HIV highly active anti-retroviral therapy and best described as \"combinatorial RNAi\" or \"coRNAi, \" holds significant promise over conventional mono-therapies. First and foremost, application of a silencer cocktail against multiple conserved viral sequences increases the chances of averting escape mutants, considering the evolutionary leap the virus would have to make. A stochastic computational model predicts that strong expression of four individual anti-HIV shRNAs might already suffice to prevent viral escape. 43 Second, coRNAi therapies can blend inhibitors of viral and cellular gene expression to maximize efficacy and further minimize the risk of mutational escape. Particularly promising targets are viral cell surface receptors, whose silencing would not only block the earliest step in viral infection but also strand the virus outside the cell and thus prolong the time available for its detection by the immune system. Third, combining RNAi triggers with ribozymes or other inhibitors of gene expression will allow the concurrent blocking of virally encoded SRSs and direct targeting of the viral genome (and/or cellular factors). Such a mix of RNAi and unrelated silencers will also minimize the potential risks associated with high-level mi/shRNA expression in the cell.",

Likewise, it could balance low vector efficiencies or promoter strengths that would otherwise prevent adequate sh/miRNA expression.

As predicted, raising the shRNA copy number resulted in a progressive (up to 17-fold) RNAi improvement, correlating with increased detectable shRNA expression.

In stably co-transfected cells, coRNAi of both isoforms led to an additive increase in expression of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 target \u03b2-catenin, as compared with inhibition of the individual enzymes. This report thus exemplified the usefulness of coRNAi for functional analyses and moreover implied a possible treatment for diseases linked to abnormally high glycogen synthase kinase 3-\u03b1 \u03b2 levels (Alzheimer's or type 2 diabetes).",

            "text": "From a clinical standpoint, two of the most interesting targets for therapeutic coRNAi are HCV and HIV. As mentioned before, these two viruses are particularly resistant to therapeutic intervention owing to their extreme natural genetic diversity and potential for mutational escape. Many groups therefore recently began to pursue the strategy of co-targeting viral and cellular genes (encoding host co-factors required for viral uptake, replication, or expression), on the basis that the latter are not under evolutionary pressure and are thus substantially less prone to mutation. A growing number of cellular proteins have already been identified as playing critical roles for these two viruses, and their individual silencing had significant effects on the outcome of infection. For instance, Zhang et al. used adenovirally delivered, U6-driven shRNAs against cellular La, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, and human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein of 33 kd, all known to interact with HCV. 57 Individual inhibition of each gene led to a reduction of HCV amplification in replicon cell lines, suggesting their usefulness for future co-targeting strategies including the viral genome itself. Other promising cellular co-targets are viral (co-)receptors, as their inhibition would actually prevent viral infection and not simply block viral reproduction (when targeting viral genes). However, a fundamental concern with this strategy is that knocking down endogenous genes could create an unacceptable loss-of-function pathology for the cell. Therefore, to maximize patient safety, potential cellular targets must be chosen very carefully and evaluated individually and thoroughly. This is exemplified by a report by Korf et al., who co-targeted the two cellular HCV co-factors HuR (Hu antigen R, binds to the HCV 3 -untranslated region, resulting in its stabilization) and PSMA7 (proteasome \u03b1-subunit 7, modulates HCV-internal ribosome entry site activity), together with the HCV genome (5 -or 3 -untranslated region). 58 In transfected HCV replicon cell lines, each of their individual best shRNAs (under separate U6 promoters) caused at least 50% reduction in viral RNA and similar decreases in HCV NS5B protein. Importantly, some combinations of anti-HCV and anti-HuR/PSMA7 shRNAs showed a strong additive effect, illustrated by an increase in viral protein and RNA inhibition of up to approximately 70%. Although not evaluated, this exciting result suggested the potential of this particular coRNAi approach to prevent HCV escape mutants and/or to inhibit multiple genotypes (provided they share the cellular factors). On the other hand, the therapeutic usefulness of the two cellular proteins remained obscure, as both have essential functions in the cell (PSMA7 is a proteasome subunit, and HuR an important regulator of cell proliferation).",

Similar results (with respect to the individual targets) were obtained for coRNAi vectors expressing two or all three shRNAs simultaneously. Important conclusions were the lack of competition among the individual shRNAs and the absence of non-specific effects from their vectors. However, it must be noted that the H1 promoter is relatively weak and that shRNA levels were not quantified in this study. Moreover, Huh-7 replicon cells have a reduced capacity to produce IFN\u03b1, further clouding analysis of potential side effects from their coRNAi vector. Regardless, the finding that HCV inhibition persisted for 17 days in stably transduced cell lines argues against a major adverse effect and provides another proof of the feasibility of establishing long-term coRNAi. It will be exciting to evaluate fully the therapeutic potential of the promising triple vector from this study, in particular the effect of CD81 knockdown on HCV binding or uptake.",

However, its activity was subsequently lost because a highly resistant HIV point mutant emerged within 2 months, prompting the authors to suggest anti-viral coRNAi for future therapies. Similar conclusions were reached by Song et al., who tested a combination of two different siRNAs, targeting the viral p24 or the cellular CCR5 (major HIV-1 co-receptor in macrophages) gene. 47 When the siRNAs were co-transfected into monocyte-derived macrophages, they observed a strong synergistic effect and almost complete inhibition of HIV infection, compared with a weaker effect with the individual siRNAs. Similar to Boden et al., 23 the group thus favored a vector-based coRNAi approach, ideally targeting multiple steps in the HIV life cycle. This idea was substantiated by Lee et al., 17 who reported accumulation of gag mutants in HIV-infected CD4 + T cells transduced with an anti-gag shRNA lentivirus.

However, it remains to be tested whether such an anti-receptor coRNAi approach will suffice to prevent viral resistance. Moreover, the clinical usefulness of HIV receptors as (sole) therapeutic targets remains to be validated. One concern is that inhibiting a specific receptor may select for viral variants that use a non-targeted, different (co-)receptor, ultimately negating any therapeutic effect. 63 Also, CD4 might not be an ideal target, as it is an essential cell surface molecule for immunological function. 62 In contrast, CCR5 might be dispensable for life, as there are asymptomatic individuals homozygous for CCR5 mutation. 11, 64 Likewise, CXCR4 mutation did not affect T-cell development and maturation, at least in murine studies. Nevertheless, CXCR4 knockdown is critical in stem cells (a major target for HIV therapies) as this molecule plays a role in cell homing into bone marrow. 62 Several other groups have begun to study co-inhibition of HIV genes as a therapeutic modality.

Of a battery of 86 shR-NAs against these targets, 21 were found to be transiently effective from an H1 promoter. Further studies of three of them, directed against the gag or pol genes, revealed strong individual protection against HIV challenge in stably transduced permissive cells (including peripheral blood mononuclear cells). Intriguingly, all three shRNAs combined in one lentiviral vector conferred nearresistance to viral infection. Most important, the group also studied the emergence of viral resistance in cells expressing only one or two of their most effective shRNAs. As hoped, viral inhibition was more durable in the coRNAi cell line, although eventually (day 22) most cultures were positive, regardless of shRNA copy number. Although they do not show the data, the authors also mentioned an improved vector expressing four different shRNAs (from separate and distinct promoters) and able to further delay viral escape for up to 60 days. The strength of this article is that it is the first (and only to date) to validate a multiple shRNA approach for suppression of HIV escape. It is also particularly noteworthy that the shRNAs were carefully chosen to concurrently target all HIV-1 subtypes, although this was not confirmed experimentally. Important for future use of this particular system will be to investigate the genetic stability of the threefold or fourfold shRNA lentiviral vectors, as well as the potential side effects from these unique constructs.",

Remarkably, at a higher HIV dose where the single shRNAs were no longer able to control the virus, a combination of the intand att-specific shRNA vectors still gave strong suppression for almost 3 weeks. In line with previous work, the group noted the emergence of resistant point mutants after HIV infection of single shRNA-expressing cells. Subsequently generated shRNAs specific for these mutants could suppress their replication, but, unexpectedly, a combination of wild-type and mutant shRNAs had less effect on preventing viral escape. The authors hypothesized intra-cellular competition of the various shRNA vectors for the same target site, but this idea was not validated. As in the HCV studies by Akashi et al. 60 and Watanabe et al., 61 the group also tested a long (50-nt) hairpin RNA covering the target region of their anti-int shRNA. Interestingly, this construct was able to co-suppress both wild-type and mutant HIV strains, but the effect was weak and only transient, for reasons unknown. Nonetheless, these articles together suggest that when the technical problems have been overcome and the safety of long hairpins can be guaranteed, combining multiple short and long RNAs might further increase the power of coRNAi to control viral resistance.",

After individual transfection into HCV replicon cell lines, their best candidates inhibited HCV NS5B expression by approximately 30% (Rzs) or 50% (shRNA). Although mixing various Rzs increased overall inhibition marginally, it was most notable that combining the best Rzs and shR-NAs gave an approximately 25% additive effect to each shRNA, irrespective of its initial potential (however, combinations of shRNAs alone were not tested). This study is an important proofof-concept, in particular as it further confirms the need to target different sites in the viral genome for maximum efficacy, in line with Watanabe's work. 61 Moreover, the finding that the use of different promoters for Rz and shRNA expression yielded the strongest additive effects substantiates the need to avoid promoter competition.",

In fact, the triple vector was the only construct that remained inhibitory in CD34 + cells for 28 days, even under challenge with a high HIV dose and from only 1-2 integrated vector copies. Importantly, there was no evidence for evolution of escape mutants with the triple vector, although additional validation might be needed in view of the assays used. The group also reported some minor unexpected, and not yet fully understood, findings with their vector. These include an approximately fourfold drop in viral titers under standard production conditions, approximately threefold lower transduction efficacies in CD34 + cells (versus the single shRNA vector), and a approximately 20% loss in Gfp (green fluorescent protein) expression upon longterm culture of triple-transduced cells (compared with an empty vector). Nevertheless, the overall impressive results with this unique and ingenious construct clearly illustrate the power of coRNAi for HIV therapies.

Rev is an attractive anti-viral target because it mediates nuclear export of singly spliced and unspliced full-length genomic RNAs in the HIV life cycle. Point mutations in the nuclear export signal provide the M10 Rev variant with the ability to inhibit HIV replication, rendering it a powerful therapeutic, and it is already under clinical evaluation. Unwalla et al. created a lentiviral vector in which an anti-rev shRNA was expressed from an HIV-inducible RNA polymerase II promoter. Termination by a weak polyadenylation signal permitted readthrough of the downstream RevM10 coding sequence, thus generating both functional shRNA and protein from the same promoter. In stably transduced and HIV-challenged T cells, the double vector mediated 90% inhibition of HIV p24 protein and a high cell survival rate (although a direct comparison with single vectors was not provided). Again, there was no evidence for viral escape, and, in fact, an HIV point mutant that had previously evolved in the presence of the anti-rev shRNA alone remained approximately 80% inhibited by the double vector. Together, these impressive results illustrate the power of this particular coR-NAi approach to prevent HIV resistance, identical to the triple RNA-based construct described above. 70 Last but not least, in addition to co-expression of transdominant anti-viral proteins, one can also envision synergistic gene silencing/addition in other therapeutic contexts. One remarkable example by Samakoglu et al. documented a coRNAi-protein approach for treatment of sickle cell anemia. 72 A lentiviral vector was engineered to express a recombinant \u03b3-globin gene from a \u03b2-globin promoter/enhancer and to carry an intronic shRNA against the human sickle \u03b2-globin (\u03b2 S ) mRNA. CD34 + cells from healthy humans or sickle cell anemia patients were transduced with the vector and then differentiated into erythroid cells. Impressively, all cells showed similar levels of \u03b3-globin and normal \u03b2-globin, but \u03b2 S was specifically and more than 70% reduced in the patient cells. These data imply that synergistic globin protein expression and RNAi-mediated \u03b2 S knockdown holds promise as a stem cell therapy for sickle cell anemia. Generally, together with the Rossi group's lab work, this latest study paves the way for the development of coRNAi strategies to add and delete gene functions concurrently for the treatment of human disorders.",

            "text": "However, several critical issues associated with this novel approach must be resolved to permit realization of its promise in humans and to progress to clinical trials. The keys to this transition and to paving the way for coRNAi from bench to bedside will be safety, stability, and efficacy. The safety concern is based on a plethora of earlier reports on unexpected and adverse side effects from mono-RNAi treatments, including \"off-target\" silencing, IFN responses, and translational inhibition. 73 Although it is obvious that these risks may increase proportionally with a coRNAi approach, another specific concern is oversaturation of the endogenous RNAi machinery. This might at least result in competitive reduction of the effects of the individual silencers, which could indeed explain some of the findings described above. Yet, in the worst case, overwhelming of individual factors in the RNAi pathway will result in global dysregulation of endogenous miRNA processing. A dramatic possible outcome is illustrated by our own recent study, where persistent high-level shRNA expression in mouse liver from an optimized AAV vector led to perturbation of miRNA biosynthesis. 16 This frequently (36 out of 49 constructs, directed against six different targets) resulted in liver toxicity and cellular regeneration, eventually leading to loss of the RNAi effect over several weeks. However, in almost 50% of all cases (23/49), shRNA-associated toxicity was so severe that the animals failed to recover and ultimately died from the treatment. 16 Although the detailed mechanism of toxicity is still under investigation, in line with our in vivo data, other groups have consistently reported concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects from shRNA overexpression in cultured cells. [74] [75] [76] Particularly noteworthy is a recent study by An et al., 74 who compared the toxicity and efficacy of shRNAs against CCR5 when expressed from two different RNA polymerase III promoters, U6 or the transcriptionally weaker H1. Not surprisingly, the group found a clear correlation between shRNA expression levels in cultured primary T cells and cytotoxicity, although the underlying mechanisms were unclear and seemed to vary with the U6-driven constructs. 74 Nevertheless, the authors concluded that lower shRNA numbers appear to be advantageous to maintaining the transduced cell population. This is also in line with our very recent observations of substantially increased RNAi persistency in mice treated with AAV vectors expressing shR-NAs from H1 or 7SK promoters, as compared with the more robust U6 (D.G. and M.A.K., unpublished results). Unfortunately, no published work has yet defined the limit to the number of exogenous hairpin RNAs that can be effectively incorporated into a (co)RNAi treatment, and it will likely vary with the types of cells and organs. 77 Until this knowledge is available, one cannot overemphasize the need to find the most potent target sites and hairpin RNAs, to carefully optimize coRNAi vector designs, and to work at the lowest concentrations possible. It might be especially beneficial to adapt the latest conditional promoter systems for coRNAi purposes, as they will ideally allow for restriction of gene silencing to a defined subpopulation of cells, thereby mimizing the global risks for the organism. 78 Some exciting recent examples include promoters that are specifically activated in HCV-or HIV-infected cells 79, 80 or can be epigenetically and reversibly controlled using exogenous drugs or small molecules. 81, 82 The use of these alternative promoters might concurrently help to circumvent the second concern with coRNAi, i.e., genetic instability of the multi-component vectors. Although it is technically feasible to accommodate multiple sh/miRNA cassettes into virtually any present viral vector (including the smallest of all, AAV), there are hardly any data at this point on the likely risks of recombination or deletion caused by sequence similarities or identities among the individual elements. Anecdotal evidence suggests this problem exists and could hamper the approach, as it might, for instance, explain the reported difficulties in implementing more than six identical shRNAs into a single plasmid. 48 One strategy to circumvent this problem would be the use of different promoters for each hairpin, including conventional as well as the above-mentioned novel systems. However, the resulting disproportional expression levels (based on promoter strength) might inadvertently obscure the contribution of the individual components. Alternatively, as already demonstrated and perhaps preferred, vectors can be engineered to express multiple miRNA-like hairpins from a single RNA polymerase II promoter. This could simultaneously maximize genetic stability and spatiotemporal control. On the other hand, the discrepant findings available on the efficiency of multi-miRNA vectors clearly indicate that implementation of this strategy requires an improved understanding of the cellular mechanisms that govern processing of hairpin concatemers.",

            "text": "As with any novel therapy, a stringent test for coRNAi strategies will be their evaluation in animal models of innate or acquired genetic disease or viral infection. Importantly, in vivo trials will not only allow us to evaluate the efficacy of the new vectors directly but also provide us with better clues on the physiological role of the putative virally encoded RNAi suppressors. Thus far, the majority of related findings have been obtained in artificial systems, using either robust plasmids for SRS expression (as opposed to perhaps low-level expression from the intact virus) or heterologous read-outs (e.g., using nonvertebrate cells for mammalian factors). It is thus very possible that under physiological conditions, it will become obvious that the effect of viral SRSs has been overestimated. This would agree with the perplexing fact that many of the viruses proposed to encode SRSs actually seem to hijack the endogenous RNAi pathway, as they rely on cellular or viral miRNAs for their own agenda. One example is HCV, and as we are now fortunate to have the first replication-competent wild-type isolate available, it will be possible and exciting to study the seemingly intricate interplay of the virus with the RNAi machinery in a natural scenario. 1 The lessons learned will certainly influence the future design of coRNAi vectors with respect to the importance of SRS-specific silencers. Generally, we expect to benefit from these studies because they will help us to optimize manifold coRNAi parameters, such as the balance of viral and cellular targets, possible associated toxicities, or vector-related issues such as dosing and delivery. Finally, these studies might reveal whether coRNAi will overcome a particular side effect of conventional anti-HIV highly active anti-retroviral therapy, i.e., the generation of multi-drug-resistant and highly infectious viral strains. 3 It is certainly our hope that the extreme efficacy noted thus far means this adverse effect will not occur with coRNAi-based therapies.",

We are optimistic that we have an essential advantage in this race, as RNAi might not be the primary human innate immune defense and viruses may still lag in the development of efficient counter-mechanisms. 8 The inherent modularity of coRNAi is another particular benefit, as it allows us to combine RNAi with any other efficient anti-viral therapeutic, including conventional small-molecule or protein drugs. Particularly exciting candidates emerging as potential future RNAi partners are aptamers, RNA oligonucleotides able to bind ligands with high specificity and affinity. In fact, recent work demonstrates that RNA aptamers can be expressed from RNA polymerase III promoters, identical to shRNAs, opening up the possibility of combining them with RNAi triggers in a multi-component vector. 83 Moreover, aptamers can be fused with siRNAs to permit targeted RNAi delivery 84 or can be incorporated into shRNA loops as a regulatory element. 81 Last but not least, by drawing upon our growing knowledge of endogenous RNAi pathways, the improvements in viral vector design, and the refinement of bioinformatical models of viral infection, we will be able further to enhance the efficacy of the approach. Therefore, for the first time in the history of antiviral therapies, the balance of power could be decisively tipped in our favor.",

            "text": "Strategies for combinatorial RNA interference (coRNAi). Shown is a schematic viral genome (black line) with individual RNAi target sequences (shaded boxes). Depicted are the six different possible scenarios for coRNAi discussed in detail in the text. In brief, in (a), a single region is targeted with multiple hairpin RNAs, expressed either from individual promoters (in separate or a single vector backbone(s)) or as concatemers from one promoter. Another possibility, not mentioned in the text, to increase hairpin RNA levels is the use of an inherently stronger promoter (thicker arrow). Similarly, constructs expressing multiple small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) from one or separate promoters can be designed simultaneously to target various (b) viral or (c) combinations of viral and cellular genes. (d) A unique means of co-silencing numerous regions on a single target is expression of a long hairpin RNA from one promoter. Recently, coRNAi vectors were refined to co-express short hairpin RNAs together with other nucleic acid-based inhibitors (ribozymes (Rzs) and HIV trans-activation response region (TAR) decoy (e)) or with transdominant ((f), gray circles; the asterisk indicates point mutations)) or therapeutic proteins (f, black circle).",
