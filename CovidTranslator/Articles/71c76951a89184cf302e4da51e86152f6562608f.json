Furthermore, Ministry of Culture and Tourism MCT, 2003) have claimed that the 2002 Football World Cup and the 2002 Busan Asian Games also boosted South Koreans ' self-confidence and pride, and helped further develop tour products and infrastructures. For example, in 1965 South Korea had only 37 hotels with 1837 rooms ( Hall, 1997a ; Ministry of Transport (MOT) and Korea National Tourism Corporation (KNTC) ( \u03ed former Korea National Tourism Organisation (KNTO)), 1980) compared to 127 hotels with 19,296 rooms in 1981. At the time of the 1988 Olympics 265 hotels accounted for a total of 33,189 rooms ( Chon and Shin, 1990 ) .",

Firstly, the hotel sector is one of the largest sectors of the South Korean tourism and hospitality industry in terms of capital investment and tourist expenditure ( Kim and Uysal, 1998 ) . Secondly, hotels provide the largest number of jobs, generate the greatest multiplier effect outside the industry and are major foreign currency earners ( Kim and Uysal, 1998 ) . Thirdly, in order to bid for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, one of FIFA's requirements of the host country to have compliance with under FIFA's stipulation was secure accommodation for the FIFA's family and delegation ( Lee, 2000 ; WCOIA, 1995 ) . Fourthly, it has been claimed that the hotel sector is the most affected by events due to the direct impact of event related visitor arrivals and the resulting demand for short-term accommodation ( Dwyer et al., 2006 ; McKay and Plumb, 2001 ) . Finally, little research has been specifically undertaken on the perspectives of the hotel sector on the hosting of mega-events ( Shultis et al., 1996; Byeon and Hall, 2003; Byeon, 2008 ) .",

The questionnaire was first draughted in English and then translated into Korean by the researcher, who is Korean. The questionnaire was designed to identify the Korean hotel industry's perspective on the positive and negative aspects of the Football World Cup 2002 on their individual hotel. A five-point Likert scale ranging from ' strongly disagree ' (1) to ' strongly agree ' (5) was used to rate 24 impact variables of the 2002 Football World Cup for the pre-event impacts study. However, when present results, percentage of ' strongly agree ' and ' agree ' were combined as ' agree ' and ' strongly disagree ' and ' disagree ' were joined as ' disagree ' . Settle (1995, 2004) noted that scales are used to obtain responses which will be comparable to one another and may be regarded as both efficient and practical. Twenty-four impact variables were generated from a combination of several sources of information including Ritchie's (1984) article concerning the analysis of the impact of hallmark events, Hall's (1992) hallmark tourist events book and a review of the Seoul Olympics by Jeong (1987 Jeong ( , 1992 . Table 5 .1 presents 24 pre-event impact study's variables. To make a comparison between the two points in time, including total 24 impact variables of the pre-event impacts study and adding 3 more impact variables which derived from limitation of pre-event impacts study were used to rate. Thus, a total of 27 impact variables were used in the postevent impacts study (see Table 5 .2 ).",

Pilot testing was required so that the survey could be modified slightly in content and in structure, and to ensure that mail surveying would do the job reliably Settle, 1995, 2004 ) .

Amongst respondents, unlike the pre-event study results, 21.4% had between 21 and 25 years length of work in the hotel industry. Of the respondents 95.9% were males; 45.6% were rated as first class hotels. 52.7% of respondents were located in HCs, and 21.1% of hotels were from located in Seoul. Since the questionnaires were personalised by sending them to named GM/MD, GMs were highly represented amongst the respondents of both the pre-and post-event study. Male respondents were the predominance (97.5% and 95.9%) in the two time periods result (refer to Table 5 .4 ). Table 5 .6 in contrast to the preevent study results, 19 out of 27 variables were perceived as significantly different between HCs and NHCs on their hotel. NHCs registered higher disagreement for both positive and negative impact variables than HCs, on their hotels. This result confirmed the proposition that hosted events are beneficial to the HCs (e.g. Hall, 1989 Hall, , 1992 . This result also indicates that benefits and costs generated from hosting the sports event could be differentiated by the degree of direct (e.g. HCs) or indirect (e.g. NHCs) involvement in the event. The ' direct involvement group ' has significantly more agreement perceptions towards positive and negative impacts than the non-involvement group and the findings of Jeong's (1992) study and this longitudinal study result support this notion. Hotels which benefited from the event experienced increased revenues and increased numbers of international guests during the event. Hotels in Busan showed the highest agreement that revenue had increased during the event, with 59.2% of hotels experiencing this, a significantly higher percentage than hotels not in Busan (PCSV: 13.836;SL: 0.008). In addition, in HCs, 45.4% of hotels considered that they had experienced increased revenue and in the group that consists of Seoul, Gyeonggi, Incheon and Busan, 46.4% agreed that there was increased revenue due to the event.",

However, ' increased domestic guests during the event ' 82 Misuk Byeon, Neil Carr and Michael Hall markedly ranked lower after the games (ranked 10th, mean \u03ed 2.17) than prior to the games (ranked 5th, mean \u03ed 3.25) and generated high differences in mean score (1.07) between the two points in time (refer to Figure 5 .1 , Tables 5.1 and 5.2 ). The respondents experienced very low agreement on the ' created/increased additional employment in your hotel ' (mean \u03ed 1.87). This variable created the largest gap mean score (1.35) between the two time periods. Whereas the ' reduced hotel tax in your hotel ' generated the smallest gap mean score (0.33) between two points in time (the pre-event study mean: 2.46; the post-event study mean: 2.13) (see Figure 5 .2. , Tables 5.1 and 5.2 ). As illustrated in Figure 5 .5 , ' underutilised hotel facilities after the event has ended ' (mean \u03ed 2.04) was experienced as the highest cost followed by ' insufficient parking lots in your hotel ' (mean \u03ed 1.86) . In contrast to some previous research on the negative impact of mega-events ( Hall and Hodges, 1996 ; Olds, 1998 ) the likelihood that the World Cup ' increased prostitution ' and ' increased crime ' received a high level of disagreement again at their hotel (mean \u03ed 1.40 and mean \u03ed 1.38, respectively) (refer to Figure 5 .4 , Table 5 .2 ). Additionally, results of paired t -tests reported in Table 5 .9 revealed that there were significant differences ( p \u03fd .05) on 26 impact variables between the two points in time.",

Even though, judged by mean score, the hotel sector perceived that it did not receive benefit from the co-hosted 2002 World Cup. This consistent finding in both the pre-and post-event study supports previous literature that resulting events brings international visitors to the country ( Hall, 1992 ; Ritchie, 1984 ) thus increased international guests to the hotel sector ( Dwyer et al., 2006 ) . However, there were also domestic guests displacement occurred during the event. This result indicates that domestic guests probably stayed away during the World Cup because of a possible perception that the event would be marked by inflated prices, crowds and difficulties in finding accommodation. Regular tourists can be displaced when events take up available accommodation ( Getz, 2004 ) . Note : For the pre-event ' stimulated conferences, meetings and exhibitions of before, during and after event ' are examined into only one variable. However, ' stimulated conferences, meetings and exhibitions before, during and after event ' are examined individually in the post-event study. Therefore, pared t -tested tests for both events are done by three variables in the postevent with the one variable of the pre-event.",

In addition, individual hotels do not have to contribute to the costs of staging such national event so therefore their income from the World Cup would be expected to be greater. However, lower ranking agreement on the ' increased the revenue of your hotel ' in the post-event result than the pre-event study supported growing numbers of global critiques on the hosting event and justification for establishing large sports facilities ( Hall, 1992 ; Hiller, 1989 ; Thorne and Munro-Clark, 1989 ) .

In addition after the World Cup in 2003 the tourism industry experienced a decrease in international arrivals due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the war in Iraq (MCT and KNTO, 2004) . Global circumstances were not good for South Korea utilising co-hosted Football event to increase international visitors to South Korea before, during and after the World Cup.

Both of these areas are under researched in the event literature. This longitudinal study revealed that the hotel sector's expectation of the benefits from the co-hosted World Cup was higher before the event but reality was not satisfied as they expected. However, deluxe (deluxe 1st and 2nd class) hotels and HCs received benefits from the hosted World Cup the results of which this longitudinal study answered the question of who gets benefit from the hosted sport event even though hotel sector's high expectation was not satisfied in the reality of the games.",

Thus, from the largest of mega-events through to the smallest non-profit event, the perspective of many stakeholders must be considered. Different planning and policies are thus required to suit different hallmark events in order to maximise benefits and minimise or ameliorate costs and negative impacts. Therefore, on-going monitoring is also required to better manage impacts generated from hallmark events ( Hall, 1992 ) .",
