The event prompted the Canadian Government to focus its attention not only on public health emergency planning and response, but on monitoring and control of both infectious and chronic non-communicable diseases, risk factors and their determinants. The infrastructures and skills for surveillance had eroded over the past two decades. As the responsibility for health in Canada is divided between the federal government and 13 provinces and territories, 14 governments were implicated in a critical examination of how to improve Canada's public health system and the surveillance function at its core. 1 A renewal package for public health in Canada's highly decentralized context contained several recommendations, including the call for an exclusive national public health leadership position. 2 The response to the call was the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) in September 2004. 3 ",

A synthesis of the major gaps found and recommendations made in past reviews of Canada's health surveillance provided guidance. It reflected the complexities inherent to surveillance systems plus those attributable to Canada's decentralized data collection across federal/provincial/territorial (F/ P/T) levels and the local/municipal level. 4 Some of the recommendations included: (1) the need for better coordination among the various participants in surveillance activities; (2) more consistent use of surveillance data to inform policy and programme decision making; (3) full exploitation of administrative and clinical databases, including electronic health records, for their rich data supply; and (4) consideration of the needs of customers/users of surveillance systems and products in the design of surveillance systems. 4, 5 The cornerstone of interjurisdictional collaboration in Canada is F/P/T mechanisms. Post SARS, an F/P/T mechanism specific to public health was created e the Pan-Canadian Public Health Network. One of its expert groups e the Surveillance and Information Expert Group (SIEG) e is leading and coordinating surveillance, information collection, analysis and sharing across Canada. The overarching vision guiding SIEG is that Canada has a geographically distributed, linked, collaborative pan-Canadian system, where surveillance includes communicable and non-communicable diseases, injuries and adverse events.",

In response, under the auspices of the Canadian Lifestyle Research Institute, a not-for-profit applied research institution, Canadians of different age groups are being surveyed by telephone using a physical activity monitor. 7 The instrument routinely tracks changes in physical activity patterns and factors influencing behaviours with respect to physical activity within a health determinants framework. Surveys are also conducted in workplaces, schools and municipalities to relate a person's environment to physical activity levels. Annual progress reports with national and provincial/territorial data and score cards with key indicators are provided to F/P/T governments. 5",

In reality, a policy decision is the product of a particular political, social and cultural context, arrived at through a non-linear process. It is a negotiated outcome, often evidence informed e midway between an opinion-based policy that uses selected evidence or untested views, and an evidence-based policy that has sound evidence at the heart of the policy choice. 8, 9 With chronic disease, a complex interplay of risk factors is heavily influenced by underlying socioeconomic, cultural, political and environmental determinants. Precise epidemiological evidence supplied by surveillance systems is, by itself, unlikely to be sufficient input to drive a healthy public policy decision to deal with chronic disease. 9 Existing surveillance systems may also be too narrow in what they collect. They may be limited to a particular set of epidemiological indicators of chronic diseases or risk factors that do not fully capture all the aspects or the full consequences of interventions, limiting the basis on which interventions can be judged and justified, particularly given the links between health and socio-economic determinants. If this is the case, the challenge with traditional surveillance systems is to link with other data sources to provide the information needed to understand the range of factors influencing chronic diseases, and to supply information for the broader arguments that we want to make.",

Some current activities include: assessing the impact of various risk factors on chronic disease, starting with salt intake and cardiovascular diseases, and estimating the extent to which specific prospective interventions to enhance disease prevention and control are likely to modify the burden of disease; performing economic analyses to explore costeffective scenarios related to the specific prospective interventions; and developing statistical microsimulation models for scenario building as well as providing a flexible model for provinces and territories to download so they can develop their own public health scenarios based on their own data.",
