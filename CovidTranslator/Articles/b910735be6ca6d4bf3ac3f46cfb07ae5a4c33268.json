            "text": "Some of the most successful microorganisms multiply in the epithelial surface at the site of entry into the body, produce a spreading infection in the epithelium, and are shed directly to the exterior (Table 3 .1). This is the simplest, most straightforward type of microbial parasitism. If the infection progresses rapidly and microbial progeny are shed to the exterior within a few days, the whole process may have been completed before the immune response has had a chance to influence the course of events. It takes at least a few days for antibodies or immune cells to be formed in appreciable amounts and delivered to the site of infection. However, we may underestimate the time of appearance of antibodies, as the first antibodies formed are immediately complexed with the microorganism and no free antibody appears until antibody is present in excess. With a variety of respiratory virus infections, especially those caused by rhino viruses, corona viruses, parainfluenza viruses and influenza viruses, epithelial cells are destroyed, and inflammatory responses induced, but there is little or no virus invasion of underlying tissues. The infection is terminated partly by nonimmunological resistance factors, and partly because most locally available cells have been infected. Interferons are important resistance factors. They are low molecular weight proteins, coded for by the cell, and formed in response to infection with nearly all viruses (see Ch. 9). The interferon formed by the infected cell is released and can act on neighbouring or distant cells, -Entamoeba coli Giardia lamblia a This bacterium commonly infects the stratum corneum and causes erythrasma, a scaly condition of the axilla, groin and between toes.",

Freshly formed virus particles from the first infected epithelial cell enter the fluids bathing the epithelial surface and are borne away to initiate fresh foci of infection at more distant sites. Interferons too can reach these sites, and as more and more interferon is formed on the epithelial sheet more and more cells are protected, so that the infectious process is slowed and finally halted. Other unknown antiviral factors probably play a part, and the immune response itself comes into action in the final stages. Interferons are produced a few hours after infection of the first epithelial cell at a site where they are needed and without the delay characteristic of the immune response. The immune response provides resistance to subsequent re-infection, but it does not appear to be of primary importance in recovery from respiratory infections of this type.",

            "text": "The spread of infection is very rapid on epithelial surfaces that are covered with a layer of liquid because of the ease with which the microorganism in the fluid film encounters cells and is disseminated over the surface. This is true for the respiratory infections mentioned above, and also for infections of intestinal epithelium, such as those caused by the human diarrhoea viruses. The argument does not apply, however, to local infections of the skin. In this case, where the microorganism is not carried across the epithelial surface in a liquid film to establish fresh foci of infection, the whole process takes a much longer time. Papilloma (wart) viruses, for instance, cause infection in a discrete focus of epidermal cells; indeed a wart consists of a clone of cells produced by the division of a single initially infected cell. The inevitably slow evolution of single virus-rich lesions means that immune responses have the opportunity to play a more important part in the infection. Only small amounts of interferon are produced and these viruses are in any case often relatively resistant to its action. But wart virus escapes the attention of the immune system as follows. In the basal layer of the epidermis, adjacent to the antibodies and immune cells that arrive from dermal blood vessels, the virus infection is incomplete; in this layer of the epidermis, virus antigens are not formed on the cell surface and no virus particles are produced. The infected basal cell is therefore not recognised and not a target for the immune response. As the cells move further away from these immune forces, approaching the epidermal surface and becoming keratinised, more and more virus is produced for liberation to the exterior. Neither antibodies nor immune cells are present on this dry surface to influence virus multiplication and shedding.",

We may ask if there is anything that prevents them invading subepithelial tissues and spreading systemically in the host. A number of other viruses, including measles and chickenpox, infect inconspicuously via the respiratory tract, then spread systemically through the body and only emerge again to cause widespread respiratory infection and shedding to the exterior after a prolonged incubation period. The limitation of rhinoviruses and human coronaviruses to the surface of the upper respiratory tract is at least partly determined by their optimum growth temperature. Many of them replicate successfully at 33\u00b0C, the temperature of nasal epithelium, but not very well at the general body temperature, 37\u00b0C. Thus, they do not spread systemically nor to the lung. Viruses of the influenza and parainfluenza groups can infect the lung as well as the nasal mucosa, but they are generally limited to the epithelial surfaces. This is certainly to a great extent due to their inability to infect other cells, but the limitation is not absolute. Occasionally in adults and more often in infants, influenza and parainfluenza viruses infect the heart, striated muscle or the central nervous system.",

Influenza and parainfluenza viruses are liberated (by budding) only from the free (external) surface of epithelial cells, as is appropriate for infection limited to surface epithelium. A similar restriction in the topography of budding is seen with rabies virus in the infected salivary gland (p. 180). However, vesicular stomatitis virus (p. 385) is released only from the basal surface of the epithelial cell, from whence it can spread to subepithelial tissues and then through the body: topographical restriction in the site of virus release from epithelial cells reflects the polarisation of function in these cells, which in turn depends on the maintenance of tight junctions between them.",

This is a feature, for instance, in diphtheria and streptococcal infections of the throat, gonococcal infections of the conjunctiva or urethra and most Salmonella infections of the intestine. To a large extent this is because host antibacterial forces, to be described at a later stage, do not permit further invasion of tissues. Under most circumstances these bacteria are not able to overcome the host defences, but gonococci and streptococci at least often spread locally through tissues and occasionally systemically through the body. Bacteria such as gonococci and streptococci have some ability to counteract host defences (see Ch. 7), and a certain amount of subepithelial spread is inevitable. Gonococci cause a patchy infection of the columnar epithelium of the male urethra, reaching subepithelial tissues 3-4 days after infection; the yellow discharge consists of desquamated epithelial cells, inflammatory exudate, leucocytes and gonococci. Some recent studies on how gonococci adapt to this in vivo situation are described in Ch. 7. Subepithelial spread probably takes the infection to other parts of the urethra and to local glands.",

If an obligate intracellular microbe is to spread systemically from the body surface, it must first enter the blood or lymph. This means gaining access to the lumen of a subepithelial lymphatic or blood vessel, either as a free microorganism, or alternatively after entering a mobile cell (leucocyte) that will carry it to other parts of the body. The microorganism cannot replicate until it reaches a susceptible cell, and the absence or shortage of such cells except at the body surface would prevent or seriously hinder its spread through the body. Thus rotaviruses and rhinoviruses replicate at the epithelial surface but cannot infect leucocytes, and in any case would be unlikely to find susceptible cells elsewhere in the body if they entered blood or lymphatic vessels. Certain viruses (yellow fever, poliovirus) spread through the body to reach susceptible target organs (liver, central nervous system) after free virus particles have entered vessels below the skin or intestinal epithelium. Measles virus or tubercle bacilli infect leucocytes, which carry them through the body to organs such as the liver, spleen, skin and lung.",

Extracellular replication, however, itself conveys a serious disadvantage, because the microorganism is forever naked and exposed to all the antimicrobial forces that the body can summon up. Indeed bacteria and other microorganisms that are capable of extracellular replication generally advertise their presence by releasing a variety of products into surrounding fluids, many of which cause inflammation and thus bring antibacterial agents such as immunoglobulins, complement and leucocytes to the site of the infection. Lymphatics are also dilated, and carry the infecting organisms to lymph nodes for further exposure to antibacterial and immune forces. Intracellular microorganisms in contrast, * Fungi causing this condition flourish in a moist environment, and athlete's foot is restricted to those who encase their feet in shoes. However, those who do not wear shoes (e.g. tropical Africa) are vulnerable to other fungi that enter skin at sites of injury and cause deeper lesions called mycetomas. Entamoeba histolytica although exposed to the infected cell's own defence mechanisms, are directly exposed to the general bodily defences only during transit from one infected cell to another. However, if the infected cell is recognised as such by the immune defences, it can be destroyed (see Chs 6 and 9). A number of bacteria and protozoa, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Brucella abortus, or Leishmania donovani carry out much of their multiplication in macrophages that have ingested them. Although they are not obligate intracellular parasites, this shifts the host-microbe battlefield into the cell. The battle is then waged in the infected macrophage, whose antimicrobial powers (Ch. 4) and participation in immune defences (see Chs 6 and 9) become of critical importance.",

There is also a constant passage of plasma proteins and leucocytes from capillaries into normal tissues, and these are returned to the blood via the lymphatic system after entering lymphatic capillaries (see below). Indeed, their presence in tissues is inferred from their presence in lymphatics draining these tissues. The cells are nearly all lymphocytes, which leave blood capillaries by actively passing through endothelial cells. After moving about and performing any necessary tasks in the tissues, the lymphocytes penetrate lymphatic capillaries and thus enter the lymph. The lymph, with its content of proteins and cells, then passes through the local lymph nodes and generally at least one more lymph node before entering the thoracic lymph duct and being discharged into the great veins in the thorax or abdomen. Blood lymphocytes also enter lymph nodes directly and in larger numbers through postcapillary venules. The constant movement of lymphocytes from blood to tissues or lymph nodes, and back via lymphatics to the blood again, is called lymphocyte recirculation. Circulating lymphocytes are mostly T-cells, and in the course of their continued entries into tissues and lymph nodes they have regular opportunities to encounter any microbial antigens that may be present.

In experimental staphylococcal skin infections, for instance, if the early inflammatory response is inhibited by adrenalin, and the early delivery of plasma factors and leucocytes to the site of infection thus reduced, bacteria multiply more rapidly and produce a more severe lesion. Perhaps it is not surprising that Staphylococcus aureus can suppress the early inflammatory response, probably by means of its a-haemolysin which causes local vasoconstriction.* Other staphylococcal products inhibit the movement of polymorphs, and lesions are thus enhanced.",

The liver releases a variety of proteins; including C-reactive protein (see p. 291), haptoglobulins (a 2 -glycoproteins), protease-inhibitors, fibrinogen, and serum amyloid protein. The exact function of these acute phase proteins is not clear, but their presence is associated with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; see p. 291). The patient may develop headache, muscle pains, fever, anaemia, with decreased iron and zinc and increased copper and ceruloplasmin in the serum.

Microorganisms carried to the node in the lymph are exposed to the macrophages lining the marginal sinus ( Fig. 3. 3), and these cells take up particles of all types from the lymph and thus filter it. The efficiency of filtration depends on the nature of the particles, on the physiological state of the macrophages, and also on the particle concentration and flow rate, the efficiency falling off at high particle concentrations or high flow rates (see Ch. 5).",

The efficiency of the node as a defence post depends on its ability to contain and destroy microorganisms rather than allow them to replicate further in the node and spread to the rest of the body. The antimicrobial forces are the macrophages of the node, the polymorphs and serum factors accumulating during inflammation, and the immune response which is initiated in the node. Under normal circumstances, as the first trickle of microorganisms reaches the node the most important event is the encounter with macrophages in the marginal sinus. Microorganisms escaping phagocytosis by these cells enter the intermediate sinuses where they run the gauntlet of a further set of macrophages before leaving the node. If there is an inflammatory reaction in the node, a substantial migration of polymorphs into the sinuses greatly increases the phagocytic forces and thus the filtering efficiency. There is usually a further node to be traversed before the lymph is discharged into the venous system.",

Since the 1920s, however, phagocytes had suffered a long period of neglect by research workers, and after the pioneer studies very little had been added to our understanding. In recent years there has been almost a rediscovery of phagocytosis as a central and relevant phenomenon in infectious diseases. This has quickened the interest of investigators and modern biochemical, immunological and ultrastructural techniques are now fruitfully being applied to the subject of phagocytosis. Because of this blossoming of interest and understanding, and because of the central importance of the phagocytic defence mechanisms, the subject will receive a chapter to itself.",

            "text": "In addition to being able to resist host defence mechanisms, a pathogenic organism-be it an obligate intracellular, facultative intracellular or extracellular pathogen-must also overcome the problem of obtaining essential nutrients if it is to be successful. Two examples illustrate this point. Iron is essential for bacterial growth but the concentration of free iron in body fluids is too low (ca. 10\" 1 8 M in serum) to support growth. In the host, iron is bound by both intracellular (ferritin, haemosiderin and haem) and extracellular (transferrin in serum and milk, and lactoferrin in milk) Fe-binding proteins with high association constants for iron. Listeria monocytogenes may have direct access to host iron, because it produces a soluble reductant which will remove iron from transferrin. Otherwise, two main systems have been identified whereby organisms could overcome this hurdle; it is not always easy to identify which particular system is operative in vivo. One involves the synthesis of low molecular weight compounds called siderophores, which have an extraordinary affinity for iron. At the same time the bacteria express new outer membrane proteins that act as receptors for the Fe-siderophore complexes so that Fe is taken up into the cell. E. coli has been extensively studied, and three classes of siderophore have been recognised; ferrichrome, the hydroxymates and aerobactin. Salmonella and Shigella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa produce more than one siderophore. Salmonella is also known to synthesise receptors for siderophores other than its own, which could be advantageous when present with other organisms, particularly in the competitive environment of the gut. Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Mycobacteria spp. all probably produce siderophores. The mycobacterial siderophores are different. Mycobactins are lipid-soluble and membrane associated, and exochelins are water-soluble, extracellular and are the more important of the two.",

Interestingly, the expression of the trp operon (which comprises the genes responsible for the synthesis of tryptophan) is controlled by Fe as well as by tryptophan levels. A functional aromatic biosynthetic pathway is absolutely vital for growth in vivo since aromatic amino acids are generated via chorismic acid. The latter is a branch point at which the biosynthesis of p-amino benzoic acid (PABA) also begins. PABA is required as a precursor of folic acid; it is as a competitor for PABA that the sulphonamide drugs work. By introducing lesions in one, preferably two key genes in this system {aroA and aroD) it has been possible to attenuate strains of S. typhimurium such that their initial invasive properties are unaltered but their ability to grow in vivo is severely restricted. Such crippled constructs can be manipulated to carry genes encoding heterologous antigens and have been used experimentally to deliver protective antigenic stimuli to a whole range of heterologous antigens.",
