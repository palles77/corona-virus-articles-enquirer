Significant differences were found in the sizes of the three coronaviruses. Furthermore, three types of surface projection of the same lengths, but varying widths and morphology, were observed. Both IBV Corm and HCV 229E had bulbous projections characteristic of coronaviruses, although the projections of HCV 229E were somewhat thinner than those of IBV Conn. On the other hand, MHV3 particles had thin, cone-shaped surface projections, that were completely unlike typical coronavirus projections. The significance of these results is discussed.",

The virus envelope contains lipid and appeaxs to consist of a distinct pair of electron dense shells (15) and a singlestranded helical internal component that has been identified as ribonueleoprotein (10). At present, coronaviruses are classified almost entirely by means of their characteristic morphology, and although preliminary biochemical and serological criteria are now available for some coronaviruses (22) , the relative difficulty in isolating and growing some of these viruses in cell culture for biochemical analysis means that for some time it wilt be necessary to classify many coronaviruses entirely by their morphological features.",

Three features of coronavirus morphology were examined, namely, the envelope diameter (excluding surface projections) and the length and width of the surface projections. Approximately 50 envelope diameters of each virus species were measured. In each case two measurements of diameter were taken and the average value was used in subsequent calculations. For elliptical shaped virus particles, one measurement was taken across the long axis and the other across the short axis (18) . Between 50 and 100 measurements of surface projection lengths and widths were made for each virus species. Lengths were measured from the boundary of the virus envelopes to the distal end of the projections and widths were measured at the widest parts of the projections. An analysis of variance was performed on tile measurements for each feature, using each staining method, to determine whether the gleans for the three viruses differed significantly. ",

Unfortunately, too few particles were present in crude clarified preparations to enable an accurate study to be made of them. However, pelleted virus preparations, before sucrose density gradient centrifugation, had sufficient virus particles present for analysis, although many of them were at least partially obscured by cell debris in MHV3 preparations. Essentially no difference was observed in the morphology of the three coronavirus species between partially purified pelleted and purified virus particles, suggesting that our purification procedure has little effect on virus morphology.",

Our results show that IBV Conn particles are much larger than those of HCV 229E and MHV3, and these may reflect significant molecular differences in their structures. In this respect it is interesting to note that the polypeptide compositions of IBV particles (t 1, i4) show significant differences from the polypeptide compositions of HCV (5, 6, 9) and MHV (9, 19, 20) , although the RNA genomes of IBV (8, 12, 17) and HCV (13, 21) show close similarities.",

            "text": "Most reports on coronavirus morphology, summarised by McINTos~ (I5), have suggested that eoronavirus particles have only one type of surface projection, the typical bulbous or 'tear-drop' shaped projection. However, a few reports (1, 3, 4, 16) have indicated the existence of another type of surface projection that is rod-shaped and sometimes has a spherical dilation or T-shaped structure at the distal end. Apparently, IBV (2, 3, 4) and haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (16) It is difficult to understand why the morphology of the surface projections is different. The differences cannot be attributed to staining procedures as identical methods were used for all three coronaviruses. The widely spaced typical bulbous coronavirus projections of IBV Conn and HCV 229E may reflect aggregations of the thinner, cone-shaped, MHV3-1ike projections which are more closely packed. This would explain how we have occasionally observed surface projections of different morphology in HCV 229E and MHV3 preparations. Similarly, it would clarify previous reports that have shown certain coronavirus preparations to contain atypical surface projections. However, the different surface projections may be made up of similar glycopolypeptides that are arranged slightly differently, producing a different morphology, but exhibiting similar biological functions. I t has been shown that staining virus particles with UA can vary the morphology of the projections of all three eoronavirus species and the envelope diameters of HCV 229E and MHV3. However, the action of UA as a negative stain is not understood. One suggestion is that UA is acidic and its reaction with polypeptides may depend on their isoelectrie points (7) .",
