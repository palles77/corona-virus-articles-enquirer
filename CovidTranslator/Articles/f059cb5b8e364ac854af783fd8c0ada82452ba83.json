The aim of this study was to qualify and quantify bioaerosol concentrations during bronchoscopy to estimate the occupational risk. Methods: Full-day sampling was conducted in 2 rooms while bronchoscopies were performed on patients. Two microbial air samplers were used, a wet wall cyclonic sampler and an impactor, on culture media. Identification of the culturable bacterial flora was performed with chromatographic analysis of cellular fatty acid of the isolated strain and additional biochemical tests if needed. Specific polymerase chain reaction analysis was completed on wet wall cyclonic samples for the detection of influenza A and B and Mycobacterium spp. Results: A wide variety of bacteria were collected from the ambient air. All samples yielded at least 1 Staphylococcus species. Although most of the culturable bacteria identified were normal nonpathogenic flora, such as Streptococcus spp, Neisseria spp, and Corynebacterium spp, some opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, were found. Neither Mycobacterium spp nor influenza virus was detected with the polymerase chain reaction method during this study. Conclusions: Culturable bacteria from oral, nasal, and pulmonary flora are aerosolized during bronchoscopy and could be inhaled by medical staff. The potential presence of pathogens in those aerosols could represent an occupational infection risk.",

[3] [4] [5] [6] Neisseria meningitis, Haemophilus influenza, and Acinetobacter baumanii are other well-documented occupational pathogen infections acquired by hospital personnel. 3, [7] [8] [9] The risk of influenza pandemics, emerging infections, and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria has raised concerns about the health of HCWs 10 and therefore about prevention practices that should be followed during particular procedures. Worldwide, HCWs are reported to account for 20% of all cases of acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome. 11 Some medical procedures increase the risk of occupational infections because of exposure to airborne pathogenic microorganisms. Staff can be infected during routine endoscopy procedures. 12 Accordingly, endoscopists show a higher seropositivity to Helicobacter pylori. 13, 14 Transmission of tuberculosis from infected patients undergoing bronchoscopy is another recognized occupational risk. 15 , 16 Catanzaro 15 calculated that during intubation and bronchoscopy, more than 200 units per hour of infectious mycobacteria are aerosolized from a patient.",

[19] [20] [21] Particles of saliva, mucus, and pathogenic microbes can be emitted when a patient coughs. Because particles of this kind originate from a deeper area of the respiratory system, the droplets released by coughing may be more infectious than those from sneezing. [22] [23] [24] [25] Many of these particles are small enough to remain suspended in the air for a long time, and through evaporation, larger particles can become small enough to remain suspended in the air for an extended period also. 26 From the perspective of infectious disease spread by the airborne route, inhalable particles include particles in the size range from 0.1-10 \u03bcm in diameter. If particles carrying pathogens are inhaled, they may be deposited in parts of the respiratory tract where they are likely to cause infection and disease. 20, 26 Although some researchers have reported on the infectious risk to HCWs performing high-risk procedures, to our knowledge, no study has ever documented, during bronchoscopy procedure, the real bioaerosol exposure of HCWs. Davies et al 27 reported in their 2009 review that \"no quantitative study has yet been carried out on aerosol generating procedures,\" and that \"uncertainty surrounding aerosol generating procedures make it difficult to construct effective infection control policy.\"",

Sampling of the ambient air of the 2 bronchoscopy rooms yielded a wide diversity of bacteria. Many sources of bioaerosols were identified, including outdoor air, medical staff, patients, and resuspension from surfaces. During the background and medical procedure periods, the concentrations and diversity of bacteria in the 2 rooms were noticeably different. According to Brandl and Mandal, 37 the main factors affecting the levels and diversity of airborne microorganisms in the indoor air of hospitals are the lack of cleanliness of the hospital, human activities, organic materials brought in from outdoors, and the efficiency of the hospital ventilation system. In general, the predominant genera of airborne bacteria reported in hospitals by other researchers are Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Corynebacterium. [37] [38] [39] This was confirmed by our study, because at least 1 species of Staphylococcus spp was identified in every sample.

Certain bacteria most definitely originate from the patients, such as the Streptococcus pneumoniae found in room B during the second bronchoscopy. The fact that culturable bacteria from patients were found in the air 1.5 m from their mouths indicates that HCWs in closer proximity can be exposed to some pathogenic microorganisms. The survival capacity of microorganisms is often overlooked, but it can greatly affect the bioaerosol content of the air in a room. Nosocomial pathogens can persist on inanimate surfaces. 41 Like dust, microorganisms deposited on the floor or other surfaces can be resuspended in the air as a result of people moving around, rolling stretchers in and out of the room, or any other air disturbance that might occur. 42, 43 Pathogens present in the air can therefore originate from previous patients, which underscores the importance of thorough room cleaning. The higher concentrations measured during the waiting/preparation period may well be explained by bacteria from the floor being resuspended in the air by the rolling of stretchers and by nurses walking around the room during that period.",

Mycobacterium spp and influenza A and B viruses were not detected. Pathogens present in the air are undoubtedly dependent on patient pathology, and the absence of any specific pathogens from the samples collected in this study does not mean they will always be absent. The identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria sp, and Corynebacterium sp shows that culturable bacteria from oral, nasal, and pulmonary flora were present in the air of the rooms during bronchoscopy procedures. HCW exposure to bioaerosols needs to be managed by implementation of prevention protocols and by providing them with appropriate personal respiratory protection if necessary. As previously pointed out, the main problem is not the treatment of known tuberculosis patients, but that of patients admitted for other problems with unsuspected or undiagnosed tuberculosis. 15, 44 Because HCWs never know what is hiding in the lungs of their patients, emphasis must be placed on prevention and protection.",

The implication is that a sampling zone located closer to a patient's mouth would have revealed higher concentrations and perhaps the presence of other strains of microorganisms. Sample size was also a limitation of the study. Our presence in the room needed to be accepted by the medical staff. Only 1 sampling day was allowed in each hospital, and the number of bronchoscopy procedures was limited on those days. Still, in this study, the number of bronchoscopies necessary to be statistically representative (P \u2264 .05) with an acceptable error of 20% was calculated to be 14. 45 Nevertheless, this study still raises concerns about the occupational hazards to which HCWs are exposed. It provides clear evidence of the presence of culturable opportunistic bacteria originating from the respiratory tract of patients in the air of bronchoscopy rooms. The presence of pathogenic microorganisms in the air of these rooms is to be expected from time to time, depending on patient pathology. ",
