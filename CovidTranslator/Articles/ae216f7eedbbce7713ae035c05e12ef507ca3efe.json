Then the verified data were collected and transferred for data completion or correction. No imputation was made for missing data. Data are expressed as median (IQR) for continuous variables and number (%) for categorical variables. For continuous variables, Wilcoxon test was applied to assess the difference between patients in one group and others, Kruskal-Wallis test to assess the overall difference among the RR, PR and NR groups. For categorical variables, \u03c72 test or Fisher's exact test were performed according to the distribution of data. Two-sided tests with a significance level of 0.05 were applied. Needs for different respiratory support throughout the study period were assessed using person-day that denoted the use by one person in one day. All the analyses were conducted using R software version 3.6.2 11 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). We used the tydyverse 14 package of to manage daily data and plot the daily use of main support and the pheatmap 15 package to plot the heatmap.",

Results in our study suggested that PaO2:FiO2 ratio was a sensitive indicator for early identification of severe Covid-19. On D1 87.8% of the patients in our study had an PaO2:FiO2 ratio lower than 300 mmHg, while the SPO2 was 96 (93-97) %, and 72.8% without symptoms of dyspnea. With the early identification of the severe illness, 93.8% patients were receiving various respiratory support from or before D1, with a median PaO2:FO2 ratio of 204 mmHg. In the previous studies, 4,6 the median PaO2:FO2 ratio on ICU admission reported were much lower (103.8 and 136 mmHg), while many of the studies didn't report the data. [1] [2] [3] 5, 20 It is reasonable to hypothesis that hypoxemia may participate in the inflammation and multiple organ injury 21 if the hypoxic compensatory period was ignored or not timely treated due to limited oxygen support equipment when confronting a surge of patient flow. 22,23 Therefore, we comprehensively analyzed the respiratory support used during the study period. If severely ill patients can be recognized earlier, basic oxygen therapy and close monitoring may suffice, as in the 42% of the patients in our study. This scenario is quite different from that in Wuhan, where more than 80% of patients needed advanced respiratory support. 4, 6 Advanced respiratory support equipment is life-saving but a large availability of conventional oxygen therapy is also necessary. Prioritizing and providing basic care for severe Covid-19 patients should be considered by healthcare providers in early stage.",

Regarding the duration from symptom onset to hospital visit time, there's obvious difference between studies from Wuhan and outside Wuhan where the mortality rate was much lower than Wuhan. The reported median hospitalization duration was 5-11 days in Wuhan, 3,4,20 while 2-4.5 days in Zhejiang province, 7 Beijing 10 and our study. In the 41 cases study from Wuhan 3 , a significant difference was observed for this duration between ICU and non-ICU patients (8 vs . 1 day, p=0.002) . In our study, because most of our patients were admitted 18 to hospital early, the duration was similar in the RR, PR and NR group (median: 3, 4, and 4.5 days, respectively).
