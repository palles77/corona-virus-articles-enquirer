It is the responsibility of the immune response to contain and control viral replication. Paradoxically, it is the immune response that may also contribute to the development of neuropathology. We have used mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a positive-strand RNA virus, infection of the CNS to understand the dynamic interaction between viral replication, protection, and pathology with an emphasis on understanding how chemokines participate in these interrelated processes. Herein, we demonstrate the complexity of the chemokine response to MHV infection of the CNS and the delicate balance that exists between host defense and development of disease.",

Contributing factors include anatomic difficulties imposed by the blood-brain-barrier as well as the absence of evident lymphatic drainage. Furthermore, the relative absence of MHC class I and II expression combined with limited numbers of antigen presenting cells suggest that mounting an effective immune response against a viral antigen is difficult. However, in spite of these apparent obstacles, activated cells of the immune system are able to enter the CNS and participate in elimination of viral antigen. Moreover, the presence of activated immune cells e.g., T lymphocytes and macrophages contribute to the development of pathology in various viral model systems.",

            "text": "The molecular mechanisms governing the development of inflammatory events and an adaptive immune response to viral infection of the CNS are just now being understood (1) (2) (3) . Increasing evidence has demonstrated the importance of chemokines in orchestrating events surrounding inflammation follow-ing viral infection or injury. Chemokines represent an ever-growing family of secreted proteins that function as potent mediators of inflammation (4) . The chemokine superfamily is divided into four subfamilies based on both structural and functional criteria. The two major subfamilies are the CXC and CC chemokines. The CXC subfamily is structurally characterized by conserved cysteine residues that are separated by an amino-acid whereas the CC subfamily has the conserved cysteine residues adjacent to one another. Lymphotactin, the sole member of the C family, is chemotactic for T lymphocytes. The CX3C chemokine, fractalkine, is unique in that it is expressed on the surface of cells as well as being secreted into the surrounding environment. Chemokines target distinct leukocyte populations during periods of inflammation through interaction with specific receptors. The CXC chemokines function primarily in attracting neutrophils, yet have a limited effect on T lymphocytes and monocytes. However, there are exceptions to this rule in that CXC chemokines that lack the glutamic acidleucine-arginine (ELR) motif on the amino terminus are chemotactic for T cells by binding to the shared receptor CXCR3. The CC chemokines attract T lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages but not neutrophils. To date, all chemokine receptors identified are members of the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (5) . Following chemokine binding to its cognate receptor, signaling events are initiated that result in various cellular processes such as increases in intracellular calcium, production of cytokines and chemokines, adhesion to the endothelial matrix, and chemotaxis (6) . In addition, there is growing evidence that chemokine receptors influence the polarization of T cell immune response (i.e., Th1 vs. Th2) in tissue (7) . Viral infection of the CNS results in a temporal expression of chemokines by resident cells of the CNS e.g., astrocytes and microglia as well as by inflammatory cells. Recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between chemokine expression and leukocyte entry into the CNS following viral infection (8) (9) (10) (11) . There is an increasing amount of evidence indicating that chemokine expression is beneficial by attracting lymphocytes that participate in an antiviral response. Conversely, chronic chemokine expression in response to persistent viral infection of the CNS may contribute to neuropathology by attracting activated T lymphocytes and macrophages into the CNS which then release cytotoxic factors. This brief review will focus on recent studies evaluating the functional significance of chemokine expression as it relates to both host defense and disease development following mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of the CNS.",

In situ hybridization analysis revealed that IP-10 and RANTES are predominantly expressed surrounding demyelinating lesions present in the spinal cords of mice persistently infected with MHV (1, 8) .

As stated earlier, CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes contribute to an antiviral response during the acute stage of disease. The majority of T lymphocytes which infiltrate into the CNS expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR3 (2, 3) . This suggests that the ligands for CXCR3, IP-10 and Mig, may perform prominent roles in host defense through attraction of T lymphocytes into the CNS following viral infection. However, although T lymphocytes are essential in host defense, CD4 + T lymphocytes have also been shown to participate in MHV induced demyelination during the chronic stage of infection (1) . As mentioned earlier, IP-10 and RANTES are prominently expressed surrounding demyelinating lesions suggesting that chronic expression of these molecules may participate in MHV induced demyelination through attraction of inflammatory CD4 + T lymphocytes and macrophages into the CNS (1,8) . Herein, we present data focused on defining the functional significance of IP-10, Mig, and RANTES expression as it relates to both Chemokines and viral infection of the CNS host defense and neuropathology following MHV infection of the CNS.",

IP-10 expression is inducible by both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 while Mig expression is strictly dependent upon IFN-\u03b3 (26) . Analysis of the kinetics of IP-10 and Mig mRNA expression within the CNS of MHV-infected mice revealed that IP-10 is clearly detectable by day 2 p.i. and is prominently expressed at days 7, 12 and 35 p.i. (8) . In contrast, Mig expression is limited to days 7 through 12 p.i. which coincides with the presence of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA transcripts (3). Based upon these data, it is interesting to speculate that early expression of IP-10 may reflect local production of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 in response to MHV infection which in turn activates both infected and uninfected cells to produce IP-10. On the other hand, Mig expression is delayed until activated T lymphocytes enter the CNS and produce IFN-\u03b3.",

MHV infection of CD4 -/and CD8 -/mice resulted in increased mortality and delayed clearance of virus from the CNS which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating an important role for T lymphocytes in CNS host defense (1, 13, 14, 28, 29) . Interestingly, infected CD4 -/mice displayed a significant decrease in the level of CNS inflammation as well as demyelination when compared to both CD8 -/and wild-type mice ( Table 3) . Immunophenotyping of the CNS cellular infiltrate in CD4 -/mice revealed a significant decrease in the numbers of activated macrophage/microglia (1) . Furthermore, analysis of chemokines expressed within the brains of CD4 -/-, CD8 -/-, and wild-type mice revealed significantly lower levels of RANTES mRNA and protein within the CNS of infected CD4 -/mice as compared to wild-type and CD8 -/mice. These data suggested that CD4 + T lymphocytes either produced and/or influenced the production of RANTES by other cellular sources e.g., glial cells and/or lymphocytes. Furthermore, RANTES is known to exert a potent chemotactic effect on macrophages suggesting that the decreased demyelination and inflammation within CD4 -/mice is, in part, due to diminshed RANTES expression that results in decreased macrophage infiltration into the CNS (30) .",

            "text": "Our studies on the functional activity of chemokines during MHV-induced CNS disease illustrate the complexity of chemokine expression as it relates to both host defense and disease development. Early expression of the T lymphocyte chemoattractant chemokines IP-10 and Mig represents a dominant response to MHV infection of the brain and is important in attracting IFN-\u03b3 producing T lymphocytes (both CD4 + and CD8 + subsets) into the CNS which then participate in viral clearance. Further, RANTES expression also contributes to host defense by exerting a chemotactic effect upon T lymphocytes and macrophages. However, MHV RNA and antigen persists within white matter tracts of the CNS and animals develop a demyelinating disease in which T lymphocytes and macrophages are important contributors. Chronic expression of the chemokines IP-10 and RANTES are detected within areas of MHV persistence undergoing demyelination suggesting that these molecules participate in the disease process by maintaining a chronic inflammatory response. Indeed, anti-RANTES treatment of persistently infected mice resulted in diminished macrophage infiltration into white matter tracts accompanied by a decrease in the severity of demyelination. In addition, we have recently determined that anti-IP-10 (but not anti-Mig) treatment of MHV infected mice with estab-lished demyelinaton resulted in decreased T lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS, decreased demyelination, and increased remyelination to damaged axons (M.T.L. and T.E.L., unpublished observations). With regards to chronic expression of chemokines and immune-mediated demyelination, a similar situation exists in MS patients. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated increased expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors within the cerebral spinal fluid of MS patients undergoing acute clinical attack as well as within demyelinating lesions suggesting a pathogenic role for these molecules by attracting leukocytes into the CNS (31) (32) (33) . IP-10, Mig, and RANTES are among the chemokines expressed in MS patients and are associated with demyelinating lesions (31) (32) (33) . Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that these chemokines function to attract T lymphocytes and macrophages into the CNS which ultimately results in white matter destruction. Finally, it is important to note that our studies on antibody-mediated neutralization of chemokine activity as a means to modulate the severity of neuroinflammation and neurologic disease supports and extends earlier studies that have suggested that targeting chemokines may offer novel methods for interventional therapies aimed at treating human neuroinflammatory diseases such as MS (34, 35) .",
