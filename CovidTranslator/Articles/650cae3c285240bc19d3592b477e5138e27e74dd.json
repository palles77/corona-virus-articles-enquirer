Moreover, relying on this novel SEIR model and some probabilistic arguments, we have found four formulas that are suitable for estimating the basic reproductive numbers R 0 in terms of the ratio of the mean infectious period to the mean latent period of a disease. The ranges of R 0 for most known diseases, that are calculated by our formulas, coincide very well with the values of R 0 estimated by the usual method of fitting the models to observed data.",

For instance, the general guideline for mass vaccination is that the herd immunity of a population against the disease must be above some critical immunization threshold q c that is a function of R 0 and some other factors like vaccine efficacy. A very simple but illustrative choice of such a critical immunization threshold is q c \u00bc 1 \u00c0 1=R 0 , used in the traditional theory of epidemiology [1] under the unrealistic assumption (Benenson [3] , CDC [6] ) that the vaccine is perfectly effective. Although epidemiologists and theoreticians ( [3, 6] , Halloran et al. [24, 25] , Longini et al. [41] ) have been aware of this for a long time, no confident relation between the critical immunization threshold q c and the vaccine efficacy was drawn. It gives rise to the need of establishing more realistic epidemic models for the mass vaccination theory.",

As shown by the very recent case of the 2002-2003 epidemic SARS (Donnelly et al. [15] , Lipsitch et al. [36] , Riley et al. [53] , Bauch et al. [2] ), an accurate estimation of R 0 is essential for a successful control of newly emerging diseases by the public heath control measures. A large number of compartmental (both deterministic and stochastic) epidemic models (Anderson and May [1] , Hethcote [28] , Diekmann and Heesterbeek [14] ) have been proposed for this purpose (see Heffernan et al. [27] for a comprehensive review). But most of these models rely on the traditionally used assumption that both transmission processes of latency and recovery states are exponentially distributed. This assumption is biologically unrealistic, because it corresponds to assuming that such a transmission process is memoryless in the sense that the chance of change from a state 'A' to another state 'B' in a given time interval is independent of the time since the entrance into the previous state 'A'. More realistic distributions are, for example, the gamma or the log-normal distributions (Sartwell [54] ). However, the inclusion of gamma distributions, as shown by Lloyd [38, 39] and Wearing et al. [59] , could change drastically the patterns and dynamics of the epidemic models, as well as the estimate of the basic reproductive number R 0 .",

However, estimation of the intrinsic mean infection rate b depends strongly on the model and the fruitfulness of data used and is in general very subtle; cf. [1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 36, 43] . Our present method for estimating b is purely theoretical and relies on our new SEIR model. Based on some sophisticated probabilistic arguments (cf. Section 4), our method yields that the intrinsic mean infection rate b can be determined in terms of the three main factors of a disease: the mean latent period (denoted by s), the mean infectious period, and the transmission patterns of the latency and recovery processes. The typical transmission patterns of latency and recovery will be divided into four types: light (Type I), moderate (Type II), severe (Type III), extremely severe (Type IV). Our method yields the following four formulas (1.4)-(1.7) for calculating the basic reproductive numbers R I-IV 0 \u00f0z) associated with the four types of transmission patterns, in terms of the ratio z :\u00bc mean infectious period : mean latent period: \u00f01:3\u00de R I 0 \u00f0z), the minimal reproductive number associated with transmission patterns of Type I (with the slowest latency process and the fastest recovery process). R IV 0 \u00f0z), the largest reproductive number associated with transmission patterns of Type IV (with the fastest latency process and the extremely slow recovery process).",

The newly (re)-emerging diseases SARS, Ebola, AHC, FMD, influenza, influenza pandemic and avian influenza are put also into the category 'mild', since they have an observed relatively small basic reproductive number R 0 . The category 'severe' includes the rest severe and extremely severe diseases like Chickenpox, Mumps, Rubella, Measles, etc. which have an observed large basic reproductive number R 0 . The newly emerging infections Acute HIV-1 and Acute SIV belong also to this category. Although our method for estimating R 0 is purely theoretical, the resulting estimates of R 0 (given in Table 2 of Section 3 and Table 4 of Section 4) fits very well to the published estimates of R 0 (see, e.g., [1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18, 36, 43] ) using data from known outbreaks and using other models. This indicates that the four functions R I-IV 0 \u00f0z) given above can be used as empirical formulas for estimating R 0 for unknown diseases -a point that is especially valuable for the control of a newly emerging disease, because the three main factors (the mean latent period, the mean infectious period and the types of the transmission patterns), which are needed for estimating the values of R 0 for that disease, are observable as the disease spreads.",

In the literature, Eq. (2.9c) is called the final size equation and is also satisfied by many other models [28, 27] . Historically, the final size equation was derived for the first time by Kermack and McKendrick [33] in 1927 for the classical SIR model. In a realistic situation, the control measures will be implemented at a certain time point t 0 P 0 after the disease has spread. The baseline for the implementation of control measures is to reduce the effective reproductive number R eff \u00f0t) (given by (2.6)). It is expected that the epidemic will be brought under control if the effective reproductive number will be maintained below some level d < 1 after t 0 , a certain time point after the intervention. Our following result confirms the theoretical correctness of this expectation. ",

            "text": "h Our estimation of the mean latent period s and the infectious period r for HIV-1 cells is based on the data given in [49] , [50] and [37] , by which the latent period s is equal to the reciprocal of the clearance rate c (i.e., s \u00bc 1=c) and the infectious period r is equal to the reciprocal of the infected cell loss rate d (i.e., r \u00bc 1=d). It was estimated (see Table 5 .1 in [50] ) that the values of c have a range of 3:1 AE 0:6 which yields an estimate for s \u00bc 1=c of 1=3:7 % 0:3 to 1=2:5 \u00bc 0:4 days. However, as pointed out in [49] , these values of s are in general underestimated. It is very likely (cf. [37] ) that the values of s range from 0.5 to 1.0 days. On the other hand, different models and methods ([49,50,37] ) yield different estimation of the values of d. In [49] (see also [50] ), it was estimated that the values of d vary from 0.3 to 0.7 (with a mean value of 0.5), while in [37] (Table 4 there) the values of d vary from 0.2 to 0.5 (with a mean of value 0.3). Based on these considerations, we assume, as given above, that the values of s range from 0.5 to 1.0 days, and the values of r \u00bc 1=d range from 1=0:7 % 1:4 to 1=0:3 % 3:3 days.Our result suggests that each HIV-1 infected human cell will infect on average (7:6 \u00fe 27:7\u00de=2 $ 18 cells over the course of its life span when CD4 target cells are not limiting. In [37] , a similar result (of $ 19 cells) was obtained. i SIV stands for simian immunodeficiency virus. Our estimation of the mean infectious period r for SIV cells is based on [47] from SIV infected macaques, by which the infectious period r is equal to the reciprocal of the infected cell loss rate a (i.e., r \u00bc 1=a). It was estimated (see Table I of [47] ) that the values of a range from 0.51 to 0.96. Moreover, it was known (cf. [47, 37] ) that the latent period s for SIV is between 0.5 and 1.0 days. Therefore, we assume, as given above, that s ranges from 0.5 and 1.0 days, and r ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 days.Our result suggests that each SIV infected macaque cell will infect in average (6:8 \u00fe 22:1\u00de=2 $ 15 cells over the course of its life span when CD4 target cells are not limiting. In [47] , the estimated R 0 values vary drastically under different models: R 0 ranges from 4.2 to 17 in the exponentially distributed model with a mean latent period of 0.5 days, and R 0 ranges from 5.4 to 68 in the fixed time delay model with a mean latent period of 1.0 days. * Sources: Benenson [3] and 'The Pink Book' of CDC, 9th Ed., 2006 [6] . ** The subjects under study are cells.

Particularly, we find that it is possible to control SARS and relatively mild Smallpox and Influenza by isolation alone, while HIV (h > 80%) can be controlled only under very effective isolation combined with very effective contact tracing [42] ; cf. Table 3 . Similar controllability conditions are obtained by M\u00fcller et al. [45] and Fracer et al. [21] using different methods. For example, one result of [21] says that an outbreak can be brought under control by isolation alone, if the proportion e I of isolated symptomatic individuals is greater than (1 \u00c0 1=R 0 \u00de=\u00f01 \u00c0 h), which is the same result as given by our inequality (3.11b). However, this conclusion of [21] is based on the unrealistic but mathematically simplifying assumption that both latency and recovery processes are exponentially distributed. By contrast, in our derivation of the controllability condition (3.11b) we have taken into account all possible transmission patterns. Thus, our condition (3.11b) must be the right one for controlling an outbreak by isolation combined with contact tracing and quarantine.",

We note that two ingredients that determine the epidemic spreading are the transmission patterns and the intrinsic growth rate with which the epidemic has started. It was shown by Wearing et al. [59] that different choices of the transmission patterns and different estimates of the intrinsic growth rates can yield sometimes drastically different estimates of the basic reproductive numbers. Because of this, we postulate that the so-called basic reproductive number, R 0 , must be an overall mean, i.e., it is the result of averaging the reproductive numbers generated by all most likely transmission patterns and all most likely intrinsic growth rates.",

Another baseline for defining R 0 (Anderson and May [1] ) is to define R 0 as the expected number of secondary infectious cases generated by one typical primary case in an entirely susceptible and sufficiently large population. Since only the primary case is under consideration, the value of R 0 calculated in this way is completely determined by the dynamic behavior of the epidemic course in the early stages. It is generally known (cf. [1] ) that in the early stages the epidemic course grows exponentially with a positive growth rate, K, the so-called intrinsic growth rate of the epidemic. The estimate of the intrinsic growth rate of an epidemic depends on the models used. In our approach, we will do this by means of our model Eq. (2.1). More exactly, we use Eq. (2.1) to model the course of an epidemic spreading in a population that is homogeneously mixed and without prior immunity and control measures. This means that the recovery CDF A in Eq. (2.1d) is just equal to the intrinsic recovery CDF. In order to save the notation, below we also use A to denote the intrinsic recovery CDF.",

However, the gamma distributions are more commonly used and more important, they are more appropriate for our present purpose because their Laplace transforms can be calculated explicitly. Note that in (P1) we have dropped the restriction (4.15b) (saying W 0 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0) so that the exponential distribution can be adopted. Second, in epidemiology, very often an infected person will show a rash after the latent period. As commonly accepted in the natural sciences, such a rapid change can be modeled by the exponential growth law. Our assumption (P2) follows this basic principle. The assumption (P3) emphasizes the observable fact that the recovery process must, as successor of the latent process, change for large times more quickly than its former. In order to make the empirical study of the property (P3) more transparent, we rewrite (4.16c) as z a\u00f01 \u00c0 b\u00de \u00bc 1 \u00fe z a\u00f01 \u00c0 g\u00de with some g 2 \u00bd0; 1\u00de:",

We assume that both latency and recovery processes are exponentially distributed and the recovery process is time-independent, i.e., both CDFs W and A have the following forms On the other hand, by using (5.21) again, we have g 0 \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc I 0 \u00f0t\u00de \u00fe R 0 \u00f0t) and F\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc g\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe E\u00f0t).
