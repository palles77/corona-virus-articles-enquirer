            "text": "Over the past few decades, we have experienced a dramatic increase in the rate of emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases (Smolinski et al., 2003) . More than half of the newly recognized emerging infectious diseases in humans have their origin through direct contact with an animal reservoir or an intermediate insect vector. While the causal links between environmental or ecological changes and human health are complex, it is widely accepted that stress on an ecosystem can dramatically alter infectious disease patterns. Most anthropogenic activities such as global movement, deforestation, road and dam construction, and farming practices have become recognized as important drivers in the emergence of some of these pathogens, such as West Nile virus, SARS CoV, and Nipah virus. Basic research that can model how human encroachment on the environment leads to habitat alterations, changes in vector breeding sites or reservoir distributions, or niche invasions, for example, is essential for effective control of endemic and pandemic diseases. Hence, the control of infectious diseases would greatly benefit from integration of ecological expertise and mathematical modeling. The book Disease Ecology, Community Structure and Pathogen Dynamics highlights recent advances in theoretical and empirical research that strive to link community structure with pathogen transmission and disease dynamics.",

            "text": "The idea for Disease Ecology, Community Structure and Pathogen Dynamics arose from the 2002 meeting of the Ecological Society of America. At this meeting, Sharon K. Collinge and Chris Ray noted the increase in presentations on disease ecology and, in the following year, organized a symposium focused on community ecology and epidemiology. Furthermore, the content of the book was greatly influenced by the NSF/NIH joint program, ''Ecology of Infectious Diseases,'' which has served as a catalyst to foster transdisciplinary interactions through its annual meeting of investigators and support of research projects among scientists interested in ecology and infectious disease dynamics. The purpose of this joint program, initiated in 1999, is to encourage development of predictive models and discovery of the relationships between anthropogenic environmental change and the transmission of infectious agents.",

            "text": "The chapters in the book span a large range of ecological systems including grasslands, forests, freshwater systems, salt marshes, and the wildlife-livestock interface. Within each of these complex communities, the dynamics of a pathogen and its relevant disease are discussed. A wide range of pathogens are represented, including bacterial (Vibrio, Borrelia) and viral (Nipah and rabies viruses) pathogens, as well as a number of parasites/macroparasite systems, such as Plasmodium. The majority of the chapters illustrate and discuss how human encroachment on the environment leads to habitat alterations, and, in particular, how the disease dynamics of the pathogen shift when alterations in community structure occur. The first essay in the book by Holt and Dobson provides valuable background into principles and models of community ecology (Chapter 2-''Extending the principles of community ecology to address the epidemiology of host-pathogen systems''). An analogous introductory chapter on current traditional epidemiology models of host-pathogen systems would have provided an informative perspective on the bridges that researchers are attempting to bridge.",

            "text": "Two chapters address modeling of tick-borne diseases from very different research perspectives. The chapter by Ostfield et al. (Chapter 3-''Community ecology meets epidemiology: the case of Lyme disease'') discusses the importance of modeling the host species diversity in the case of Lyme disease. They hypothesize that, as the entire community of ground-dwelling animals, birds, and lizards shifts, the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) will change. Hence, if one can develop models of how species composition correlates to NIP, one might be able to predict the change in risk of Lyme disease in an area. The second chapter of tickborne human pathogens addresses the question of the microbial community within the tick. In the paper by Clay et al. (Chapter 4-''Microbial community ecology of tickborne human pathogens''), the authors ask whether there are predictable patterns of community organization within ticks. In their pioneering studies, the authors show that ticks harbor a diverse set of pathogens and symbionts and make a compelling case that future models of pathogen ecology should include interactions among pathogens. Obviously, an understanding of the relationship between host species diversity and the interactions among the microbial community within the tick would represent an outstanding achievement in disease ecology.",

            "text": "A large portion of the book is devoted toward the relationships within aquatic ecosystems and associated vectors and pathogens. Rejmankova et al. (Chapter 7-''Freshwater community interactions and malaria'') show how intensive agricultural activity and associated fertilizer runoff can alter the composition of wetland plant communities and thereby change the mosquito community composition. As a result, such changes may result in increased transmission of malaria. Similarly, changes in the fish community can alter the life cycle of Vibrio cholera and the potential for transmission to humans (Cottingham and Butzler, Chapter 8-''The community ecology of Vibrio cholera''). Finally, three chapters (Chapters 9-11) discuss examples of how community can influence macroparasite transmission in aquatic systems. Poteet (Chapter 10-''Shifting roles in abiotic and biotic regulation of a multi-host parasite following disturbance'') reports results of a study designed to measure three levels of anthropogenic disturbance on host-parasite systems in Pacific Northwest stream communities. Populations of snails, salamanders, and stoneflies are measured at each site along with parasite load. She shows how logging changes the patterns of infection in each host as well as the relationships between parasite stages and host densities. Skelly et al. (Chapter 11-''Urbanization and disease in amphibians'') reviews how urbanization affects the distribution and abundance of trematode parasites on their amphibian hosts.",

            "text": "Three chapters provide excellent examples of how habitat loss and fragmentation or habitat structure can impact viral transmission and spread. Real and Childs show how natural landscape barriers such as rivers and preferred habitat can limit rabies spread by raccoons, and how these can be used to manage wildlife through vaccination efforts (Chapter 12-''Spatial and temporal dynamics of rabies in ecological communities''). Ray and Collinge review how changes in landscape have led to changes in North Amer-ican prairie dog community structure and how these changes may affect the prevalence of sylvatic plague (Chapter 14-''Potential effects of a keystone species on the dynamics of sylvatic plague''). Agriculture practices that led to the Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia are discussed by Daszak et al. (Chapter 13-''The emergence of Nipah and Hendra virus: pathogen dynamics across a wildlife-livestock-human continuum''). The authors elegantly demonstrate that recent emergence of these viruses can be understood using a combination of field, laboratory, and modeling approaches. Importantly, their work supports the hypothesis that the emergence of these viruses is due to ecological and not evolutionary drivers. The chapter also illustrates how multidisciplinary teams can work together to build predictive models for the discovery of the relationships between anthropogenic environmental change and the transmission of infectious agents.",

The book will be of interest to a broad audience including researchers engaged in the fields of microbiology, ecology, and epidemiology, as well as advanced undergraduates, land managers, and public health practitioners. Overall, the book provides useful theoretical background in community ecology and practical techniques for those studying community aspects of infectious disease. The book will be an essential resource for those engaged in community epidemiology and should serve to stimulate additional interdisciplinary research efforts in the ecology of infectious diseases.",
