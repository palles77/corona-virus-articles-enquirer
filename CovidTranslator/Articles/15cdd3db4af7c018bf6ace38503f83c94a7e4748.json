The IBV Gray and JMK strains had 99% nucleotide sequence similarity. The overall nucleotide sequence similarity of the Gray and JMK strains compared with other IBV strains was between 82.0% and 87.4%. The similarity of the predicted amino acid sequence for the S1 glycoproteins of the Gray and JMK strains was 98.8%. Six of the 10 differences in the amino acid sequence were found between residues 99 and 127, suggesting a possible role for that region in the tissue trophisms of the viruses. The S1 glycoprotein of the Gray and JMK strains had 79.5%-84.6% amino acid similarity with the published sequence of other IBV strains. Serine instead of phenylalanine was observed in the protease cleavage site between the S1 and $2 glycoprotein subunits for the Gray and JMK strains, which was similar to the published sequence for the Ark99 and SEI7 strains. The significance of that amino acid change is not known. Based on the nucleotide sequence of the Gray and JMK strains, the BsmAI restriction enzyme was selected by computer analysis and was used in restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to differentiate the two strains.",

The S 1 glycoprotein sequences of Gray and JMK presented here are the first published sequences for this serogroup (designated JMK). By computer search and agarose gel electrophoresis, the BsmAI was found to be the best enzyme for distinguishing between the Gray and JMK strains in our PCR/RFLP serotype identification test.

Six of the 10 differences between the amino acid sequences of the Gray and JMK viruses were in a variable region between residues 99 and t27. This corresponds to a variable region with the Massachusetts serotype reported by Niesters et al. (17) between residues 117 and 131. The overall differences in the amino acid sequences observed between all of the IBV strains examined herein were located between residues 34 and 138 and 234 and 324. Similarly variable regions between residues 40 and 129 and 271 and 378 have been reported by Cavanagh et ah (19) for closely related serotypes of IBV. Our data extend this observation to include different serotypes of IBV, suggesting (as others have) that these regions may be involved in forming serotype-specific and virus-neutralizing epitopes.",
