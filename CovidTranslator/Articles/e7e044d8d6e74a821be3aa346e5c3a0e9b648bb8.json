Histopathologic examination of a tissue biopsy revealed nodular pyogranulomatous panniculitis with intralesional pigmented fungal hyphae. A dematiaceous fungal isolate was isolated with a micromorphological phenotype consistent with the anamorphic genus Exophiala: budding cells, torulose mycelium and annellidic conidiogenesis from simple conidiophores consisting of terminal and lateral cells that tapered to a short beak at the apex. Sequence homology of the internal transcribed spacer region of the rDNA gene confirmed the identification of the isolate as Exophiala attenuata. Reported here is the first confirmed case of feline phaeohyphomycosis caused by E. attenuata in North America. Similar to historical cases of feline phaeohyphomycosis caused by Exophiala spp., there was no history or postmortem evidence to suggest the patient was in an immunocompromised state (e.g., suffering from FeLV or FIV). Although aggressive surgical excision of local lesions is recommended prior to drug treatment when dealing with subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis, surgery followed by itraconazole treatment did not resolve the E. attenuata infection in this cat.",

            "text": "Melanized (dematiaceous) fungi known as ''black yeasts'' can cause significant and re-occurring phaeohyphomycosis, chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in the skin and soft tissues of animals and humans. Deposition of melanin in the fungal cell wall plays an important role in virulence and pathogenicity of these pathogens, aiding to elude host immune responses by negating hydrolytic enzymatic attack and scavenging of free radicals liberated by phagocytic cells during the oxidative burst [1] . Black yeasts exist either as a yeastlike state with division by unicellular budding or can grow filamentously. All species known to cause disease are classified in the ascomycete order Chaetothyriales [1] , where the majority of the clinically relevant species fall within the Chaetothyriales and belong to the family Herpotrichiellaceae. The ability to reproduce by unicellular growth is found exclusively in the genus Exophiala; for this reason, the majority of disseminated black yeast infections are caused by Exophiala spp. [1] . Aside from causing opportunistic superficial and systemic mycoses in warm-and cold-blooded animals, Exophiala spp. are considered ubiquitous fungi, historically isolated from a variety of environmental substrates such as soil and sediment, decaying wood and plant material, and drinking water [2] [3] [4] . Conclusive diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis caused by an Exophiala spp. requires several steps including histopathologic examination of clinical samples, culture followed by microscopical examination and sequencing of a representative barcoding gene, such as the internal transcribed spacer region or the D1/D2 region of the nuclear large subunit rDNA gene [1, 2, 5] . This case report details the conclusive diagnosis of a phaeohyphomycosis caused by E. attenuata occurring in the hind paw of a domestic short haired cat.",

The slowly progressive mass was first noticed by the cat's owner approximately 8 months prior to presentation. A tentative diagnosis of chronic inflammation was made, and antibiotic therapy and topical steroids were initiated (injectable cefovecin and topical hydrocortisone). The condition did not respond and the therapy, was discontinued; 2 weeks later, a surgical biopsy was performed to remove the mass. Histopathologic examination revealed an incompletely excised nodular pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis with intralesional pigmented fungal hyphae (phaeohyphomycosis). Itraconazole oral suspension (10 mg/kg once daily) was started, and the patient initially did well postoperatively, but 6 weeks later her owner reported that the cat had become lethargic, the mass had returned and a new skin mass had developed. The draining, primary mass was swabbed and submitted for culture and fungal identification. The cat was euthanized 2 weeks later due to progressive lethargy and anorexia and development of a distended abdomen. The cat's medical history prior to the development of phaeohyphomycosis was unremarkable. She was regularly vaccinated against feline leukemia virus (FeLV); however, she had not been tested for FeLV or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).",

Phaeohyphomycoses in cats are predominantly subcutaneous, whereas infection of the eyes, bones, central nervous system and organs are rare. Subcutaneous infections observed in cats mainly occur via skin trauma due to puncture wounds often caused by wood [7] . Presumably infection of the cat in this case report occurred in a similar manner via implantation of the pathogen into the subcutaneous tissue of the paw following trauma. Although several fungal species can cause phaeohyphomycoses, previous case reports of feline phaeohyphomycoses caused by Exophiala spp. have been limited to two species, E. jeanselmei and E. spinifera [8] [9] [10] . Phylogenetic analysis performed on the Exophiala genus during the description of the E. attenuata taxon [6] revealed that one of the E. spinifera isolates causing a nasal phaeohyphomycosis in a cat was in fact an isolate of E. attenuata as the isolate conclusively grouped together within the E. attenuata clade. Of the remaining two other incidents of phaeohyphomycosis attributed to E. spinifera [9] , the identity of only one of these isolates was subsequently confirmed by ITS sequencing [6] . It is possible that the second E. spinifera isolate may have been E. attenuata based on the shared similarities in micromorphology of these two taxa, and also given that the diagnosis in early case reports was made based solely on micromorphology, prior to the description of the E. attenuata taxon. Unfortunately, no voucher specimen was persevered for this isolate; therefore, it is impossible to test this hypothesis using molecular methods. With the addition of our case report, the occurrence of phaeohyphomycosis in cats caused by E. attenuata appears to be more prevalent that previously reported.",

In this case, the patient had not been tested for FeLV or FIV infection, and thus, infection with either of these immunosuppressive viruses cannot be entirely ruled out; however, there was no history or postmortem evidence to suggest the patient was suffering from FeLV or FIV. Similar presumptions of a predisposing immunodeficiency were also made in previous case reports of feline phaeohyphomycosis involving E. spinifera, yet in both cases tests for FeLV were found to be negative [9] . In previous reports of phaeohyphomycosis involving E. jeanselmei, there was also no predisposing immunocompromised state determined [10] . In the only other case report of feline phaeohyphomycosis involving E. attenuata (at the time identified as E. spinfera), no predisposing factors could be found and all tests for FIV, FeLV and FIP were negative [8] . Cumulative evidence suggests that healthy cats are susceptible to infection caused by Exophiala spp. and a predisposing immunocompromised state should not be assumed.",

Recommendations for the most effective treatment of phaeohyphomycosis require knowledge of the pathogen identity, as drug susceptibility varies between species. In many cases involving Exophiala phaeohyphomycosis, a correlation between MIC values obtained in vitro and the clinical response to drug therapy is often misleading. This discrepancy has been attributed to the in vivo reality, where the pathogen is exposed to diurnal fluctuating drug levels [11] . Moreover, as in our case, where the infection was compartmentalized within areas of subcutaneous inflammation, it is unclear as to how much of the drug actually penetrates the zone of infection and reaches the infecting fungus. Relapses following drug therapy are frequently reported [8, 9, 11] , requiring patients to undergo repetitive long-term antimycotic therapy, which often leads to off-target toxicity such as hepatotoxicity [9] . Interestingly, itraconazole therapy has been associated with congestive heart failure in a small subset of human patients [12, 13] and carries a ''black box warning'' against administration to patients with ventricular dysfunction such as congestive heart failure due to negative inotropic activity (Sporonox, Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., Olen Belgium). It is possible that the areas of fibrosis in this cat's heart were subclinical but predisposed the patient to the development of heart failure and subsequent bicavitary effusions after administration of itraconazole, although this cannot be confirmed in this case.",
