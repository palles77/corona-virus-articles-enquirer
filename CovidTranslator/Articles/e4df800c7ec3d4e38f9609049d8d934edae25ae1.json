Live virus experiments were performed in Biosafety Level 3 facilities under governmental and institutional guidelines. Viruses were propagated by inoculation into 9-to 11-day-old SPF embryonated fowl eggs via the allantoic route. Hemagglutinating allantoic fluid was collected from eggs and used directly.",

Four-week-old male C57/B6 mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China). Mice were caged in a specific pathogen-free facility. Lung injury was induced in all groups except for the pulmonary edema testing through intratracheal injection of vehicle control or virus (10 6 TCID 50 ) using a technology that we have previously described for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike protein and acid-induced lung injury [4] . Mice for the use of pulmonary edema testing were treated with intratracheal injection of vehicle control or virus (5\u00d710 5 TCID 50 ). Losartan (50 mg kg \uf02d1 ) was injected i.v. once per day for continuously 4 days after H5N1 virus instillation.",

The lungs were dislodged from the thoracic cavity and placed in a glass vial containing approximately 50 mL of fixative. Each glass vial was assigned a number unknown (with respect to treatment) to the pathologists. The lungs were fixed for at least 48 h before further processing. The formalin-fixed mouse lungs were embedded in paraffin, thin-sectioned coronally, and mounted onto glass microscope slides using standard histopathological techniques. The sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. For each group, six mice were euthanized, and the mouse lung tissues were examined under the 200\u00d7 and 400\u00d7 objectives. For each mouse, a slide containing one lung section was examined independently by three pathologists blinded to the treatment or genotype. The numbers of inflammatory cells were counted in 100 microscopic fields, and lung injury scores were quantified inclusive of the alveolar wall thickness, hyaline membranes, and proteinaceous debris filling the airspaces to yield an overall score between 0 and 1.",
