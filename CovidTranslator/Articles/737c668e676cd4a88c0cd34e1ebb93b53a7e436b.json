            "text": "The baboon story: origin of the use of cell culture selectivity for differentiating viruses * In the early 1950s the attack rate of paralytic poliomyelitis was at its peak in the United States. The development of a safe and effective vaccine against poliomyelitis was essential for its prevention and control. In dire need of a cell culture system appropriate for the production of poliovirus vaccine, Dr. Joseph Melnick suggested I test the sensitivity of baboon kidney cell cultures to poliovirus infection. At that time (1955) I was a neophyte in the field of cell culture (originally called tissue culture) and virology, and was ignorant of what a baboon looks like. Nevertheless, armed with much curiosity, I started my career by hands-on learning how to prepare kidney cell cultures from two baboons, Papiopapio (guinea baboon) and Papio cynocephalus (yellow baboon) (see Fig. l ), the former from West Africa and the latter from south Central Africa, and testing the sensitivity of their kidney cells in culture to viral infection.",

Not wanting to waste the 'left-over' cell cultures, I asked Dr. Melnick if I could test additional enteroviruses available in the laboratory at that time. These included 5 types of Coxsackie B virus, Coxsackie A9 virus, and 14 types of echoviruses, all were tested by serial dilutions. Inoculated culture tubes were microscopically examined daily for evidence of cytopathic effect (CPE). Microscopic reading for CPE in thousands of culture tubes proved to be very tedious; however, curiosity continued and careful examination for evidence of cellular changes was initiated 24 h postinoculation.",

A parallel concept was formulated for virus identification and its application in the rapid differentiation of virus isolates as in the case of polio-, Coxsackie A and B and echoviruses. Indeed, as is the case for the differentiation of Gram-negative bacteria by the sugar fermentation test, so it was, more or less, for the differentiation of human enteroviruses by selective sensitivity of cell cultures. At the 1956 Federation Meetings in Atlantic City, the concept of selective sensitivity of cell cultures for virus differentiation was presented (Hsiung et al., 1956) . Though the concept was considered revolutionary, it was viewed with hesitation and skepticism by the audience, including the well-known virologist, the late Dr. J. Smadel. At that time, viruses were mostly identified and characterized by serologic methods.",

The epidemic of genital herpes has aroused great public concern. Genital herpes is different from other common venereal diseases in that it has no cure. During the course of primary infection, the virus travels via sensory nerves to the dorsal root ganglia where it can establish a latent state, and can be reactivated at any time. In addition, if a pregnant woman has active infection at the time of delivery, she can transmit the virus to her newborn child, and the infection in the neonate is often fatal. Furthermore, an epidemiologic association between infection with HSV-2 and cervical cancer has been noted. Thus, it is important to make an accurate diagnosis of HSV infection in the genital tract, especially in pregnant women.",

I noted that 100% of virus isolations were obtained in both ML and Vero cells inoculated with specimens taken from women with genital lesions. On the other hand, specimens taken from women without lesions only induced CPE in ML, but not in Vero cells.

Why is it that HSV-2 isolates obtained from asymptomatic women do not grow in Vero cells upon primary isolation ? Yet, I cannot find any difference between the isolates obtained from the two sources\".

Bearing in mind that human viruses, in general, only replicate well in cells of human or non-human primate origin, with a few exceptions, Landry, being a new investigator in clinical virology inoculated PiCh samples into all cell culture types available at that time in our laboratory, including HELF (human embryonic lung fibroblast), HEK (human embryonic kidney), HP (human placenta), Hep-2, RhMK (rhesus monkey kidney), and GPE (guinea pig embryo) (see Fig. 4 of its availability in the laboratory at the time for our research projects on guinea pig viruses. Lo and behold (!), an extensive virus-induced cytopathic effect was observed only in GPE cells within 3 days postinoculation; no evidence of cellular change was noted in any of the other cell culture types, including human cells similarly inoculated.

Currently, most of the laboratories are using multiple cell systems in their isolation attempts. These include MRC-5, A549, RhMK and RK or GPE cells (Fong and Landry, 1991 (Hsiung, 1993) . Mixed infection remains a mystery since no one would expect such a finding when one starts to look for an unknown etiological agent of an infection or disease. There is no exception. In the winter of 1992 during Dr. Buck's virological survey of marine animals, a sample taken from the tongue lesion of a killer whale was submitted for virological studies; a mysterious incident occurred. After several passages of the isolate in primary African monkey kidney cell cultures, a few herpes particles were seen in one of the samples fixed for electron microscopy (EM). However after subsequent passages, two distinct cytopathology effects were noted when the samples were inoculated into two cell systems, the African green monkey kidney cells (AGMK) and a dog thigh tumor cell line (A-72 cell). A rounded cell CPE occurred in AGMK cells, but extensive syncytial cell formation occurred in the A72-cell line. Since herpesvirus was suspected of causing the tongue lesion, infected monolayers from both cell cultures were fixed and embedded for electron microscopy. Although herpesvirus particles were observed in the AGMK cell, unexpectedly, retrovirus particles were found in the A-72 cells. In order to confirm the later observation, reverse transcriptase (RT) activity was examined from supernatant of the infected A-72 cell culture. Indeed, it was positive for RT activity in the presence of manganese. In this case, the mixed infection would not have been recognized without using the two cell systems, i.e., AGMK cells and A-72 cells, in the passages of the isolate. Identification of the two distinct viruses was made possible by the use of electron microscopy: a herpesvirus-like particle with cytomegalovirus-like morphology in the AGMK cells, and foamy virus morphology (retrovirus) in the A72 cells were evident.",

For several months, we had negative results in examining numerous lots of bovine sera using both cell culture isolation method and directly electron microscopy. In order to test the validity of our method of examination, we added known viruses -in this case parainfluenza type 3 (a paramyxovirus), and a bovine herpesvirus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus to 100 ml of calf serum. This mixture was distributed to two investigators without prior knowledge of the mixture. One milliliter was removed to test for the presence of infectious virus and 99 ml was concentrated for examination by electron microscopy. After 1 week of examination, according to Dr. Fong's EM result, virus particles of a paramyxovirus and also herpes particle were found in the calf serum sample. However, to my great surprise, only the herpes virus induced CPE was noted in the bovine kidney cell culture tubes inoculated with the known mixtures of calf serum samples, but the parainfluenza type 3 virus was never recovered by the second investigator, Dr. Swack (Swack et al., 1975) . It was then realized that the lot of calf serum used contained a high titer antibody to parainfluenza virus type 3, thus preventing its recovery in the cell culture method, although the virus particles can be recognized under electron microscopic examination.",

From this experiment we learned a lesson that calf sera which contains antibodies to parainfluenza viruses should not be used in culture medium for clinical specimens. It was therefore suggested that culture medium should be free of calf serum for isolation of influenza and parainfluenza viruses. Because of the evident restrictive selectivity of a cell type for a certain virus, the use of multiple cell culture systems is necessary and rewarding. It matters, therefore, that a cell culture system can amplify small amounts of virus and also possess a broad spectrum of support for viral replication, but detection of each virus may require separate techniques. The search for a universal cell culture system remains a challenge for cell culture enthusiasts. It is up to the current day and future generations of diagnostic virologists to make this dream a reality. Recycling discoveries on 'presumptive identification' of human enteroviruses As a researcher in basic virology, I had no prior experience in clinical medicine.

Based on the differential sensitivities of rhesus and patas monkey kidney cells, the clinical suspicion of a Coxsackie B virus causing the patient's pleurodynia symptoms was in question. From our previous study (Chapter l), a presumptive diagnosis was suggested that the patient had an echovirus rather than a Coxsackie B virus infection. A preliminary report was therefore made that an echovirus was isolated from the patient and that the virus isolate was decidedly not belonging to the Coxsackie B group. Even the possibility of a mixed infection with a Coxsackie B virus was nil, since patas cells are usually highly sensitive to group B Coxsackie viruses. However, the attending physician was very skeptical at that time with the presumptive diagnosis based upon cell culture selectivity.

The saying 'history repeats itself' is not inapplicable in this anecdote of 'recycling discoveries'. During our pioneering years of unrelenting search for a differential cell culture system for grouping enteroviruses, during the early 1950s it was, as I recall, the observation that rhesus monkey kidney cells showed a broad-spectrum sensitivity to most, if not all the enteroviruses; in contrast, baboon and patas (Chapter 1) monkey kidney cells, to our surprise, displayed a partial differential biologic property. For the first time, without the use of serologic tests, enteroviruses were divided by the selectivity of kidney cell culture systems; i.e. cultures derived from R cynocephalus (a baboon) were sensitive to 3 types of poliovirus and 5 types of Coxsackie B viruses, but were resistant to Coxsackie A9 and 14 types of echoviruses. Similarly, grouping into patas-sensitive and patas-resistant enteroviruses followed shortly; such as the 3 types of poliovirus and the 5 types of Coxsackie B virus belonging to the former, and Coxsackie A9 and 14 types of echoviruses to the latter group. Since supply of baboons and patas monkeys was limited, the Hep-2 cell line was included in the early studies (Chapter 1). It turned out that Hep-2 cells mimicked exactly patas cells in their selectivity (Hsiung, 1962) .",

Large, clear plaque, appearing 4-6 days postinoculation were recognized as poliovirus (Fig. 6 ).

This was a fatal case of only 24 h duration in the ward. Postmortem specimens (heart, spleen, liver, lung, muscles and intestines) in 10% suspensions were each inoculated into 3 of each of the following tube cultures: rhesus monkey kidney cells, green monkey kidney cells and Hep-2 cell cultures. After 2 weeks' observation, no CPE in any of the inoculated tube cultures was found. Frozen 'leftover' specimens were thawed and used to inoculate two bottles each of rhesus monkey kidney cells, then overlaid with agar medium. After 5 days, only the heart muscle inoculum yielded 5 and 15 plaques, respectively; plaques were medium-sized, round with clear centers. Virus from the 15 plaques did not replicate in Hep-2 cells in tubes which remained normal as in the primary isolation. Parallel subcultures replicated well in rhesus monkey kidney cells and produced distinct cellular changes in 48 h. This material provided the source of virus stock for identification which was finally identified as echovirus 9 by neutralization tests (Monif et al., 1967) . Compared with fluid culture, the plaque technique under agar overlay proved to be more sensitive for isolation of enterovirus when the number of infectious virus in the inoculum was too few to produce detectable CPE in fluid cultures. The formation of plaques in the primary isolation procedure served as an amplification in a localized area; therefore, an adequate amount of virus stock for identification purposes was possible.",

Along with serum samples collected from the outbreak, DA's postmortem specimens included whole blood from the heart, liver, stool and intestinal contents (Hsiung et al., 1962) . In our laboratory, all DA specimens made into suspensions were inoculated into bottle cultures of rhesus monkey kidney (RhMK) monolayers, 6 cultures per sample, then overlaid with agar nutrient medium. In parallel, RhMK and HK (human kidney) cells in tube cultures were also inoculated with the same specimens and then replaced with fluid medium. Neither CPE was observed in any of the inoculated tube cultures with liquid medium nor plaques in bottle cultures inoculated with suspensions of liver, stool or intestinal contents. After 8 days of incubation, however, 5 of the 6 RhMK culture bottles inoculated with whole blood samples showed plaques that increased in size and number, giving an average titer of 16 plaques/ml of blood. None of RhMK and HK tube cultures originally inoculated with the whole blood in parallel with bottle cultures showed any evidence of virus-induced changes. When supernatant fluid of the RhMK and HK tube cultures originally inoculated with whole blood was subsequently tested in RhMK bottle cultures under agar overlay, clear plaques were again evident. Thus, direct isolation of DA virus was accomplished in RhMK cells and HK cells, although no evident changes in fluid cultures were seen, plaque formation under agar overlay medium was observed upon subculturing of the culture fluid. It was indeed a mystery for several months, because only virus-induced plaques were repeatedly obtained under agar overlay medium, yet no CPE was observed in parallel fluid cultures.",

Immune serum against measles virus produced in a monkey neutralized both PaMK and Hep-2 cell-adapted measles viruses (Hsiung et al., 1958) . Further, we proceeded to use the patas-adapted measles virus and the plaque reduction neutralization test for determinations of neutralizing antibodies against measles virus in human sera. Serum taken from a patient prior to symptoms had no antimeasles neutralizing antibodies, but one day after rashes appeared, about 90% plaque reduction by a serum dilution of 1: 25 was observed. The titer of neutralizing antibodies continued to increase up to 6 weeks (the latest tested) after onset of measles infection in the same patient. Thus, the plaque reduction neutralization test proved to be the most sensitive method showing immune response to measles virus infection. Once the rashes appear, measles antibody is demonstrable in the blood. To recap, the plaque technique applied to measles virus in bottle cultures under agar overlay medium is not only useful for quantitation of neutralizing antibodies in human sera, but the changing of fluid medium of Hep-2 cells when used over a period of 2-3 weeks also has been eliminated, and the incubation period was cut short to only 5 days.",

Believe me! Hundreds of bottle cultures were overlaid with agar medium after serial passages of Fig. 9 . Summary of plaque variation of Coxsackie A9 virus. The numbers in the small, medium, and large circles give the percentage of the small, medium, and large plaques in the populations tested (Hsiung, 1961, Yale J. Biol. Med. 33, 369) . the Coxsackie A9 virus in the irradiated PaMk cells; thousands of virus titrations, 3 repetitions of each experiment... by any standards, there was a great deal of bench work. I think now, it would be beyond anyone to do these kinds of experiments as I did, with all of the automation of the present day. We used the non-irradiated (non-IrPa) and irradiated patas MK (IrPa) cells which were exposed to low doses of X-ray. Each passage of Coxsackie A9 virus, after replication in IrPa cells (adapted virus) was carefully examined. What do you know! On the 5th serial passage in IrPa cells, definite CPE appeared in the IrPa cells, but was absent in the non-IrPa cells serially inoculated in parallel (Hsiung, 1959) . The CPE continued to intensify with higher passage levels in IrPa cells. Surprisingly, after the 14th passage in the IrPa cells, CPE also appeared in the non-IrPa cells when the adapted virus was inoculated into the non-IrPa cells.",

However, their isolate did not induce intranuclear inclusion in infected green monkey kidney cells followed by fixing in absolute methyl alcohol. After some 6 months of searching, we found that antiserum obtained from the laboratory of Sweet and Hilleman inhibited our isolate which induced intranuclear inclusions, thus confirming that PA-57 is serologically identical to SV40 which showed no inclusions when infected cells were tixed with absolute methyl alcohol (Gaylord and Hsiung, 1961) . In this case, the fixative fluid, Zenker's for us and absolute methyl alcohol for Sweet and Hilleman, made all the difference, the mystery! In the meantime, Dr. William Gaylord, my colleague, finally examined, by electron microscopy, PA-57 infected cells which were kept by Gaylord for several months back. To our big surprise, small virions similar to those of human wart virus were found (Gaylord and Hsiung, 1961) . Thus Gaylord and Black hand-carried the EM photos of our PA-57 isolate, and drove to Washington, D.C. to visit Eddy and co-workers who reported that tumors were induced in baby hamsters inoculated with supernatant fluid from uninoculated RhMK cell cultures (Eddy et al., 1961) . It became clear that rhesus monkeys apparently have a virus infection due to SV40, but this never shows up until it is transferred to African monkeys, including patas monkeys. In the latter monkeys, apparent infections were accelerated by X-irradiation as in our case. It was the EM that finally identified the virus morphology into the group of viruses including human (wart)pupilloma, mouse polyoma, and the monkey vacuolating virus; it was then proposed by Melnick as 'PAPOVA' virus group (Melnick and Papova, 1962) .",

True enough, serological testing of all the rhesus monkeys (7 singles and 7 pools of sera) showed presence of antibodies against PA-57, while only a few patas monkeys (4/l@ had SV4a antibodies in their sera. In succession, a second isolate, PA-58 was obtained 7 days after PaMK cells were X-irradiated (February 1958) . Then, also non-irradiated PaMK cells of this lot spontaneously degenerated 19 days after seeding. The third (1960) and fourth (1961) isolates were obtained in non-irradiated PaMK cells held 3-4 weeks after seeding. Considering that 'vacuolating virus' also manifested in non-irradiated PaMK cells, X-ray irradiation merely accelerated the time interval for spontaneous degeneration to appear. Without X-irradiation, the spontaneous degeneration might have been missed, since spontaneous degeneration in non-irradiated PaMK cells usually appeared about 3-4 weeks after seeding; however, the usual period of holding cultures was about 2 weeks before the cells are discarded.

To my perception, it is only second to white mice in popularity as a laboratory animal. While we were embarking on full scale general studies on latent virus infections in apparently healthy laboratory animals, inbred guinea pigs of strain 2 and strain 13, and randomized bred Hartley strain were included. Strain 2, included because of its unique susceptibility to a fulminant transmissible acute lymphoblastoid leukemia, L2C that arose spontaneously (Congdon and Lorenz, 1954) , is of special interest since strains 13 and Hartley are resistant to the L2C leukemia.",

Kaplow brought in a strain 2 guinea pig with the hope that we can find the 'leukemia virus' in this animal species since virus particles associated with guinea pig leukemia were reported (Nadel et al., 1967; Opler, 1967) . As a routine, kidneys were removed aseptically from this animal. One kidney was given to a new technician, and the kidney pair was given to a research fellow for culture. The story goes that the new technician processed the kidney for cell culture on the same day the guinea pig was sacrificed, while the research fellow kept the paired kidney in the refrigerator at 4\u00b0C and processed it the following day. Mysteriously, cell culture monolayers from the kidney prepared immediately after sacrifice, spontaneously showed areas of degeneration 9 days after seeding , while cells prepared from the second kidney which were kept at 4\u00b0C overnight remained healthy, but were found susceptible to the agent present in the degenerating cultures from the first kidney. Cellular changes were focal areas of swollen rounded cells with intranuclear inclusions characteristics of viral inclusions. Subsequently, of the 17 strain 2 guinea pigs studied, 15 manifested spontaneous degeneration in kidney cell cultures 9-13 days after seeding. On two occasions, virus was also isolated from spleen, liver and lung tissues. Guess what? Mysteriously, homogenized tissue extracts never yielded any virus isolate. Neither strains 13 nor Hartley yielded any virus isolate whatsoever.",

As mentioned above, strain 2 guinea pigs are susceptible to transmission of LzC/NB leukemia cells, a stable leukemic cell line. Guinea pig 'leukemia virus' particles were observed in cells and tissues of leukemic guinea pigs; however, virus particles have never been found in cells cultured in vitro. It was at this time that Lowy et al. (1971) reported that bromodeoxyuridine/iododeoxyuridine (BrdU/IrdU) can activate murine leukemia virus in cultured cells. Without further delay, BrdU was added to our cultured cells derived from the spleen of leukemic strain 2 guinea pigs with the hope of finding guinea pig 'leukemia virus'. Eureka! For the first time, cultured guinea pig cells showed virus particles after BrdU activation (Hsiung, 1972) . Again, the mystery goes that these virus particles were absent in spleen cell cultures without the treatment of BrdU; while cell cultures derived from the same organs of leukemic strain 2 guinea pigs showed virus particles only after cultures were exposed to BrdU. In all instances, observations of virions were made only by EM. Most of the mature virions are in extracellular spaces; never were virions seen in the nucleus. At this point, we thought we had obtained the guinea pig leukemia virus.",

In 1967, two separate groups of investigators reported the observation of virus particles in tissues and leukocytes of leukemic guinea pigs; thus named the virus as 'leukemia virus' of guinea pigs (Nadel et al., 1967; Opler, 1967) . However, transmission of the disease with the partially purified virus particles from leukemic guinea pigs to normal guinea pigs was not successful (Feldman and Gross, 1970) . In our laboratory, attempts were made to culture the cells obtained from leukemic guinea pigs with the hope that we can isolate the virus. It was at (1994) this time that two reports showed that murine C-type virus can be induced in nonproducer murine cells with the addition of BrdU (Aronson et al., 1971; Lowy et al., 1971) . Without further delay, similar experiments were performed in our laboratory using cultured guinea pig cells derived from both leukemic and non-leukemic guinea pigs. To our surprise, virus particles similar to those observed in leukemic guinea pig tissues were observed in cultured cells derived from both leukemic and non-leukemic guinea pigs as long as the cells were exposed to a medium containing BrdU (Hsiung, 1972) . Because of the similarity between murine C-type virus and those observed in the guinea pig cells, the guinea pig 'C-type virus' was named 'C-type virus' instead of 'leukemia virus'. Immediately following our report, several laboratories confirmed our findings and the name 'C-type virus' was used (Nayak and Murray, 1973; Rhim et al., 1973) . With the additional studies on the morphology of the guinea pig virus which appear to be closer to the murine B-type virus (Dahlberg et al., 1974) , disputes of nomenclature as to whether 'B-' or 'C-' type should be used for the guinea pig virus were recorded in the literature. Because of the inconsistent nomenclature of the guinea pig virus, we even named it 'G-' type to represent the 'guinea pig oncornavirus ' (Fong and Hsiung, 1976) .",

Again with excitement, we resorted to the fastest method to identify the 82-A agent. When infected cells were examined under EM by Dr. Caroline K.Y.

Antisera against human adenovirus, CMV, herpes simplex, and simian adenovirus (SV17), all gave negative results. Our excitement ends declaring that 82-A virus is an equine cytomegalovirus on the grounds of morphology, together with physicochemical and biological characteristics.

Fetal bovine serum is a common nutritive supplement for cell cultures and has been for several decades. Although it has been suspected that calf serum may harbor certain viral contaminants, it is often forgotten in a clinical situation. Recently, a mystery occurred in 3 separate clinical laboratories that were using a common lot of a cell line, A549 cells (Fong et al., 1992) . Similar CPE was observed in this lot of A549 cells inoculated with various sources of clinical specimens. Although CPE resembled that of herpesvirus group, immunofluorescence identification using antisera against a variety of viruses including HSV, CMV, VZV, adeno-and many others was without any success. However, when the A549 cells were fixed for EM, a herpesvirus morphology was confirmed. Without further delay, the bovine virus was identified as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, a bovine herpes virus by immunofluorescent antibody, which proved to be the contaminant in the lot of calf serum that was used to propagate the cell line. Beyond argument, the usefulness of EM in detecting and recognizing unknown agents or viral contaminants is notable. When all other methods fail, EM proves to be the most useful tool. Identification of a viral isolate from a killer whale Nowhere prior to the report of Buck et al. (1993) can we find a reference to show that marine mammals suffer from an arthropod-borne virus infection. At the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Dr. Charles Buck and co-workers have an on-going project screening virus infections of cetaceans. As part of this project, Sea World, Inc., Orlando, FL, sent pieces of postmortem brain, lung, kidney and other organs of a male killer whale (Or&us orca), which was more than 25 years of age, to the Virology Laboratory at ATCC for viral cultures. Evidently, this killer whale became anorexic and lethargic in 24 h. It died 48 h after the onset of illness (September, 1990) . Postmortem histopathologic examination reported a non-suppurative meningoencephalitis. In the above laboratory, virus isolation was undertaken by inoculating supernatants of tissue suspensions of various organs including brain, lung and kidney into cell cultures, such as: primary African green monkey kidney cells, a dolphin cell line, SP-IK (ATCC CCL 78), and bovine turbinate cells (ATCC CCL 1390). On the second blind passage, SP-IK cells inoculated with either brain, lung or kidney samples showed definitive CPE. Results of this viral isolation were presented at the July 1991 American Society for Virology Annual Meeting in Fort Collins, CO. Inquisitively, I asked what the identity was of the virus isolate. Since no identification was made, I suggested that the investigators send the infected dolphin cells to our Virology Laboratory at the West Haven VA Medical Center for electron microscopy.",

None of the other cetaceans in the immediate vicinity of the infected killer whale came down with the same illness. Evidently, from CDC 1990 MMWR (CDC, 1990 there was a recognized outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis in Florida at the time the killer whale died. It is possible that the animal was just an incidental host (see Fig. 13 ), like humans who suffered severe encephalitis; most often, other animals if infected, were subclinically infected and were unrecognized. EM in this present study, as in the previous chapters on the identification of other virus infections of monkeys, guinea pigs, horses and cows, is undoubtedly a useful tool in diagnostic virology. Not only does EM provide a rapid presumptive identification of a virus according to its size and morphology, it also simplifies the final identification process since focusing on a specific group of the unknown virus can be established.",

Dr. Norman Swack, the principal investigator, who usually liked to comment when things did not go well, performed the study using simian CMV-infected human diploid WI-38 cells, without any complaints. Meanwhile, Dr. Frank Michalski, who was doing a similar study using human CMV, strain Ad 169-infected human diploid cells (WI-38) for immunofluorescent tests of human serum, complained bitterly that he was not able to perform the tests due to extensive non-specific reaction. Since Frank seldom complained about anything, a big question came to mind: 'Why is it that Frank, who was working with human CMV, had so much trouble?' One day, while I was driving on highway I-95, it suddenly dawned on me... Maybe the two different sources of virus strains made the difference. When I returned to the laboratory, I suggested that Norman Swack and Frank Michalski exchange their infected cells on coverslips, that is, simian CMV against human serum, and human CMV against simian serum.

In the following days, to Frank's disappointment, no signs of virus-induced changes were noted by light microscopy in the inoculated cultures. Why did 'the isolation attempt fail'? This became Frank's first mystery in diagnostic virology. Certainly a mystery, since the spectrum of cell cultures used was known to be the most sensitive for HSV isolation and undoubtedly would support replication of HSV if any virus was present in the brain biopsy. Furthermore, electron microscopy of the brain tissue also failed to show any herpesvirus virions. The patient was in a coma and needed assisted ventilation; he was administered a lo-day regimen of intravenous vidarabine, a treatment for HSV, and his recovery was dramatic.",

In addition, a repeat inoculation of the brain biopsy suspension into another litter of newborn mice produced similar results. Incredible but true!

The mystery originated with David J. Brigati, M.D., a clinical pathology resident at the Department of Laboratory Medicine who came from the Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York. Doubtful of his light microscopy of histopathological readings of lung tissue sections obtained from immunosuppressed patients as to whether intracellular inclusions were actually induced by adenovirus or herpesvirus, he made inquiries as to where to find the expertise he needed to solve his dilemma. The answer he got was \"Ask the help of Dr. G.D. Hsiung.\" Prior to our work, the nucleic acid hybridization technique was already fashionable with the use of radioisotope-labeled probes for application in clinical laboratories. Due to the serious limitation of short shelf-life of the reagents, and to personnel because of handling isotopes and their disposal, a desirable alternative was ventured and tried. It was at this time I learned that David C. Ward, Ph.D., currently Professor of Genetics and Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry and his associates at the Department of Human Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, were developing a technique on the use of biotin-labeled polynucleotide probes for detection of viral DNA. In the meantime, David Myerson, M.D., Ph.D., a resident in the Pathology Department at Columbia University, Physician and Surgery College of Medicine in New York City was interested in having some experience in Clinical Virology, came to our Virology Laboratory at the VA Medical Center, West Haven, CT, as a short-term Visiting Fellow working on a project with genital herpes in the guinea pig model.",

Although the sensitivity of the method developed to specifically detect viral genomes in cells and tissues following hybridization in situ with biotin-labeled polynucleotide probes is not on par with the best of the autoradiographic detection procedures, it does offer distinct advantages. Firstly, the biotinylated polynucleotide probe can be prepared quickly, it is chemically stable and therefore usable for long periods (18 months) of time, the serious hazard of handling radioisotopes is eliminated, handling in the laboratory is safe, and feasible, wherever immunofluorescent and immunoperoxidase staining are used routinely. Molecular biologic techniques bring wonders. If it worked with fixed tissues, Steven Spielberg's creation of Jurassic Park might still be possible... !",

Lam, DVM, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Fellow, performed a series of detailed experiments in Hartley guinea pigs. Upon the advice of the late Dr. Wallace P Rowe, M.D. of the National Institute of Health, who instructed that strict attention be paid to decontamination of fetuses with ether baths before testing, to eliminate the chance of introducing the virus mechanically from the mother. In Lam's experiments, regardless of the stage of pregnancy at which the Hsiung-Kaplow herpesvirus was injected into Hartley guinea pigs, transplacental transmission took place. GPHLV was isolated from various tissues of fetuses from infected inoculated pregnant guinea pigs (Lam and Hsiung, 1971) .",

At that conference, I was invited to give a talk on our guinea pig herpesvirus, where I reported our findings that the GPHLV (Hsiung-Kaplow herpesvirus) can be transmitted transplacentally. Dr. George Klein, summarizing for that conference, considered our report 'exceptional because other herpesviruses, for example, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) of humans, Marek's disease herpesvirus (MDV) of chickens, or Herpesvirus simirae (HVS) of monkeys are not known to be transmitted vertically'. He posed this question: 'Could this be related to relatively high permeability of the guinea pig placenta?' It was very true that the guinea pig placenta only had a single layer of trophoblasts, similar to that of humans (Enders, 1965) . Lam, K.M. and Hsiung, G.D. (1971) herpes? As suggested, Alan tried to use ACV without any hesitation; instead of topical application for genital herpes, he injected ACV intraperitoneally in guinea pigs with genital herpes. Bingo! The genital lesions in the guinea pigs dramatically disappeared (Pronovost et al., 1982) . It was an incidental finding, but with practical significance since in prior studies, ACV was found inefficient as a topical treatment for genital herpes because of the poor penetrability and absorbability of ACV In addition, intraperitoneally ACV-treated guinea pigs showed even lower viral latency following primary infection. Furthermore, reduced incidence of paralysis of hind limbs, mortality and severity, and duration of genital herpes lesions were all evident.",

The significance of these findings is immeasurable as to their clinical applications. It was our good fortune to have been able to stumble on these animal models. There are many medically important human viral diseases without counterparts in animals. May the present and future generations of virologists have more luck in discovering more animal models.",

            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus infection: a case of false-positive diagnosis by ELISA test \"Mr. Doe, your HIV-antibody screening test is positive.\" \"What, are you kidding?\" Utter disbelief runs wild in the patient innocent of any guilt associated with known practices that transmit HIV Could it simply be a mistake; yes, a mistake of some sort? In this mystery, a patient with acute leukemia was diagnosed as HIV-positive by the ELISA test, but the truth set him free.Although several reports of false-positives from HIV ELISA kits have been attributed to the presence of antibodies in the patients' sera to HLA (histocompatibility leukocyte antigens) class II antigens present in some HIV ELISA kits, there has been no systemic study to establish causal relation between these findings prior to our report (Yu et al., 1989) , the miracle of this episode.As thought 'luck into a vein of gold', we chanced on a male patient with leukemia receiving red cell and platelet transfusions, the star of this mystery, whose serum samples were available for HIV antibody screening tests. In the early days, antigens used in the ELISA kits were prepared from HIV-infected H9 cells, a human Tlymphocyte cell line, without realizing that this cell line expresses HLA-DR4 antigen.It was in September 1985, the patient first manifested HIV-antibody reactivity having been prescreened for a period of 7 months showing negativity for HIVantibody (Fig. 17) . What went awry? Could it be that a mistake was committed unknowingly in this particular test? A serial follow-up, however, presented a sharp rise in HIV-antibody levels attaining its peak 3 months later (November, 1985) , and then dramatically declined as fast as it rose in a span of 2 months, and returned to a negative level after 4 weeks. In general, HIV antibody levels do not decline as noted in this patient. These observations raised serious doubts in one's mind.As such, therefore, a series of additional tests were performed. Indirect immunofluorescence assay was done with HIV-infected and non-infected H9 cells. Immunofluorescence results, somehow as the saying goes 'spilled the beans'. Positive staining was parallel along with the ELISA results, since HIV-infected H-9 cells were used in both systems. However, it was noted that the IFA staining test on the non-infected H9 cell membranes showed a pattern very distinct from that caused by HIV-antibodies.Only after hundreds of phone calls and inquiries, was it learned that the utilization of viral antigen derived from HIV-infected CEM cells which lack human HLA antigens may give the definitive result. Focusing on the mystery, confirmatory tests Fellow, was working with us on GPCMV He showed that CMV infection in the guinea pig is similar to that observed in humans (Tenser and Hsiung, 1976) , thus strengthening the idea that GPCMV may be transmitted transplacentally in humans. In order to prove the above idea, a systematic study on transplacental transmission of GPCMV was necessary. Robert Choi, Ph.D., a newly arrived Postdoctoral Fellow with much enthusiasm, performed experiments using randomly bred Hartley guinea pigs. Either male or female or both sexes were inoculated with GPCMV then housed in pairs, and the pregnant guinea pigs and their fetuses were examined at various periods of gestation for virus infections.Since guinea pigs have a 68-to 70-day gestation, it took a long while. Finally, Robert was very happy to examine the first 3 fetuses from the first infected female guinea pig, which was inoculated 103 days previously. However, none of the fetuses showed any CMV infection. In addition, repeated negative findings were obtained in the following 43 fetuses examined coming from 10 subsequently pregnant guinea pigs that had been inoculated for 44-150 days. Naturally, Robert was very disappointed getting all the negative findings which could not be explained at that time (a mystery), especially considering that his data were so different from our early studies on GPHLV, the Hsiung-Kaplow herpesvirus. Until one day, during our weekly conference, it suddenly dawned on me: \"Robert, why don't you inoculate GPCMV into pregnant guinea pigs near term and examine their fetuses within 5-10 days postinfection?\"' YES, this time, Robert performed the experiment as suggested and was excited by his findings. More than 50% of the fetuses were infected with GPCMV Indeed, transplacental transmission of GPCMV was demonstrated only during acute primary maternal infection (Choi and Hsiung, 1978) . Fetal infection occurred at different stages of gestation ranging from 28 to 60 days postinfection; however, once circulating neutralizing antibodies appeared, even if infectious virus was concurrently present in the salivary glands of the pregnant guinea pigs, infectious virus could not be demonstrated in the fetus. Thus far, these studies with animal models have taught us many lessons on viral pathogenesis.Why are these two viruses, GPHLV, a lymphotropic herpesvirus, and GPCMV, a hemotropic herpesvirus, so different in their pathogenesis and mode of transmission?Chapter 23Genital herpes in the guinea pig model: failure to demonstrate transplacental transmission, but therapy with acyclovir showed the green lightIn principle, new antiviral agents must first be evaluated in animals for drug toxicity and efficacy prior to human use. It is desirable and an almost mandatory necessity to have suitable animal models for testing drugs/vaccines before human use. In retrospect, our studies on guinea pigs and several of their viral infections have, in fact, nailed down our understanding of some of the medically important human viral diseases (Bia et al., 1983; Hsiung et al., 1984) . Studies on cytomegalovirus (CMV) have shown the success of transplacental transmission of the virus from mothers to their offspring which has been detailed in the preceding chapter.It has always been questioned whether neonatal herpes encephalitis is due to the virus being transmitted vertically or by passage of the fetus through an infected birth canal. We attempted to answer this questions by drawing experimental designs from our experience on GPCMV TC. Chow, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Trainee in Clinical Virology, attempted to demonstrate transplacental transmission by inoculating herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) into pregnant guinea pigs either vaginally or intracardially.Infectious HSV-2 was only recovered from nerve tissues, but not from either placenta or cord blood, or amniotic fluid from inoculated pregnant guinea pigs. HSV-2 was not isolated in any of the 53 fetuses examined. Only in one instance was a neonatal transmission of HSV-2 demonstrated from mother to newborn guinea pig via an infected birth canal (Chow and Hsiung, 1982) .Needless to say, these animal models of human viral disease are invaluable, particularly in trials of antiviral agents. Once, I attended a lecture at the New Hampshire Conference in 1981, where Daniel King, Ph.D., who at the time worked at Burroughs Wellcome Laboratories, announced that they had an effective antiviral agent, acyclovir (ACV), for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infection. From the audience, a question was raised: \"Is there any side effect of the drug in pregnant women?\" Daniel King's replied, \"We don't know.\" As in a lightning flash, I thought it would be nice to test acyclovir in pregnant guinea pigs infected with CMV. To our great surprise, acyclovir was found not to have an antiviral effect on guinea pig CMV Instead, the ACV-treated guinea pigs were all dying because of the adverse effect. A twist unfolded. At that time, Alan Pronovost, Ph.D., a new postdoctoral trainee in Clinical Virology, was working on genital herpes model in guinea pigs. As ACV did not work on CMV-infected guinea pigs, would it work in guinea pigs with genitalChapter 24An incidental finding on combined antiviral therapy At this point in time, the top most unanswered question on AIDS is still 'WHAT IS THE CURE?' Lessons learned from the treatment of bacterial infections, notably, synergistic efficacy of paired antibiotic combinations, have become the backbone of researchers' hopes to find the much needed cure for AIDS. The 1990s may well be the decade of trials of using therapeutic anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) drugs in combinations with others. ERGO? Which drugs should be paired for successful combination therapy? Firm leads are nowhere for deciding the right combinations.Several antiviral agents were made available to us during the 1980s for evaluation of their potency against CMV infection.In some of the compounds, although effective, toxicity at higher doses was a limitation.Hence, paired combinations of certain compounds with different modes of action were often considered an attractive and logical approach for reducing toxicity, and at the same time enhancing efficacy of the drug. In our first attempt to study combination of antivirals in cultured cells, we found various degrees of interaction, sometimes not knowing the reason(s), i.e. why the resultant synergism or antagonism? (Yang et al., 1990) . For example, synergistic reactions were noted in vitro and later in guinea pigs against GPCMV infection using paired combinations of ganciclovir and 2'-nor-cGMP (Yang et al., 1990; Feng et al., 1992) . Since the latter is a derivative of ganciclovir and has a different mode of action, a synergistic interaction was expected. However, antagonistic interactions were not expected when ganciclovir and retrovir were used in combination (Yang et al., 1990) . Astounding! The potency of ganciclovir was significantly reduced when used in combination with retrovir against GPCMV in cultured cells. Since CMV infections are often one of the most common opportunistic viral infection of AIDS patients, concomitant use of these two drugs, one against CMV (ganciclovir) and the other against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (retrovir) is possible. In fact, some AIDS patients may have received these two drugs concomitantly. Thus, our findings on the antagonism between ganciclovir and retrovir, though incidental and unexpected, nevertheless, has some practical implication.To further test the antagonistic effect of retrovir on ganciclovir against CMV infection in vivo, several combinations of ganciclovir with retrovir were used to treat guinea pigs infected with GPCMV Our in vivo data by Feng et al. (1993) confirmed our in vitro observations. It is not known, however, whether the converse interaction is true, i.e., whether ganciclovir would also antagonize retrovir potency against HIV infection.",

            "text": "it was at this time, that Daniel Medina, Ph.D., a Postdoctoral Research Associate, was working with projects on HIV infection in our laboratory. After repeated experiments, Medina's data clearly showed that the potency of retrovir against HIV infection was also significantly reduced in cultured H9 cells in the presence of ganciclovir (Medina et al., 1992) . As yet, we do not know whether such interaction occurs in humans when both drugs are concomitantly administered to AIDS patients. One report indicated that AIDS patients with CMV retinitis treated with foscarnet lived longer than those treated with ganciclovir (Studies of Ocular Complications of AIDS Research Group in collaboration with the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, 1992 , 1992) . It is not known whether ganciclovir used for the treatment of CMV rhinitis has played any role in these AIDS patients, resulting in the reduction of retrovir potency, although possible antiviral synergistic effect between foscarnet and retrovir may have helped those patients receiving the latter two drug combinations (Burger et al., 1993) . It has been shown that synergistic toxicity of ganciclovir and retrovir, when used in combination, occurred in cultured cells and was poorly tolerated in patients because of dose-limiting hematologic toxicity, but the antagonistic antiviral activity between the two drugs has not been reported in the literature prior to our studies (Yang et al., 1990; Feng et al., 1992; Medin et al., 1992) historically, it was an incidental finding on antiviral combination therapy. Data from our 'in vitro drug combination studies' show that in the absence of firm leads or rationale, this can be used as a guideline for selecting paired combinations of drugs for testing. As it is now, I would like to quote Jon Cohen: \"How little solid ground there is for researchers to tread on as they search out the right combinations\" (Cohen, 1993) . ",
