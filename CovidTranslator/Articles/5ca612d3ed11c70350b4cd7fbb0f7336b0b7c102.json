Here we describe a recombinant human RSV reverse genetics system in which the red fluorescent protein (mCherry) or the firefly luciferase (Luc) genes are inserted into the RSV genome. Expression of mCherry and Luc are correlated with infection rate, allowing the monitoring of RSV multiplication in cell culture. Replication of the Luc-encoding virus in living mice can be visualized by bioluminescent imaging, bioluminescence being detected in the snout and lungs of infected mice after nasal inoculation. We propose that these recombinant viruses are convenient and valuable tools for screening of compounds active against RSV, and can be used as an extremely sensitive readout for studying effects of antiviral therapeutics in living mice.",

RSV is an enveloped nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA virus with a 15-kb genome that is transcribed into 10 subgenomic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that encode 11 proteins, including the 4 proteins of the nucleocapsid, N, P, L and M2-1, and the attachment G and fusion F surface glycoproteins that are the major neutralization and protective antigens. The gene order is 3 0 -NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L-5 0 . The genome of RSV possesses a single polymerase entry site for transcription at the 3 0 end in the leader region, and transcription of the genes occurs in a sequential polar fashion from 3 0 to 5 0 . There is thus a gradient of transcription from 3 0 to 5 0 and the level of each RSV mRNA correlates with its distance from the 3 0 promoter in the genome, that is, the 3 0 -most gene gives rise to the greatest amount of mRNA 4, 5 . The nonstructural NS1 and NS2 genes are the first to be transcribed and are the most abundant. These genes encode proteins that target the cellular antiviral response, thus their rapid and strong expression is crucial for virus survival, as soon as the RSV nucleocapsid has penetrated into the cytoplasm.",

Viruses with modified genomes and expressing reporter genes, such as those coding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase, are more suitable for such screenings. Coupled to the use of automated plate readers, reporter gene-carrying recombinant viruses can make these assays more suitable for standardization and high-throughput purposes. Infectious recombinant HRSV (rHRSV) can be produced by intracellular co-expression from transfected plasmids of an RSV antigenomic RNA, which is the positive-sense replicative intermediate of genomic RNA, together with the N, P, M2-1 and L proteins 6 .",

            "text": "To develop a simple, fast and high-throughput antiviral assay against RSV, we then inserted the gene coding for the monomeric red fluorescent protein mCherry or firefly luciferase (Luc), flanked by RSV gene start and gene end signals into the MluI site located between P and M genes (Fig. 1b) . The recombinant rHRSV-Cherry and rHRSV-Luc thus expressed one additional mRNA, namely mCherry or Luc, compared with rHRSV. These plasmids were transfected into BSRT7/5 cells along with four other plasmids encoding the N, P, L and M2-1 proteins to support RSV transcription and replication, as previously described 6 . Viable recombinant viruses were recovered from all three cDNA constructs. The multicycle growth competence of the recombinant viruses from passage 3 was compared with wild-type (WT) HRSV. As shown in Fig. 2a , growth kinetics of recombinant viruses were not significantly different compared with WT parental HRSV (three independent experiments, two-way analysis of variance on logarithmic-transformed data). For all viruses, maximum titres were observed at 48 h post infection (p.i.) with titres of 6.33\u00b10.25 Log plaque forming units (p.f.u.) ml \u00c0 1 for HSRV Long strain, 6.12 \u00b1 0.48 Log p.f.u. ml \u00c0 1 for rHRSV, 5.92\u00b10.53 Log p.f.u. ml \u00c0 1 for rHRSV-mCherry and 5.82 \u00b1 0.25 Log p.f.u. ml \u00c0 1 for rHRSV-Luc. The plaque phenotypes of parental and recombinant viruses shown in Fig. 2c appeared also very similar: plaque diameters were measured and no significant differences were observed (Supplementary Table 1 ). The mCherry fluorescence was readily detectable at 24 h p.i. in HEp-2 cells using a fluorescent plate reader (Fig. 2d ) or a fluorescence microscope (Fig. 2b) , and fluorescence steadily increased at 48 h and 72 h (Fig. 2d) . Luciferase activity was also detectable in extracts from infected cells from 24 to 72 h p.i. (Fig. 2d) . The signal-to-noise ratio was higher for luciferase compared with mCherry (see below). Viruses present in the cell supernatants were then propagated by three passages on HEp-2 cells. Expression of the mCherry or Luc reporter was shown to be stable over the course of eight passages. Thus, insertion of mCherry or Luc reporter genes between P and M genes has no major impact on the replicative capacities of the virus.",

Representative data are shown in Fig. 3 . Dose-response curves expressed in terms of the response (relative light units (RLUs) or relative fluorescence units on a logarithmic scale) versus the dose (p.f.u. per well on a logarithmic scale) demonstrated a broad linear dynamic range between 1,000 and 50 p.f.u. per well for rHRSV-Cherry, and between 3,000 and 5 p.f.u. for rHRSV-Luc. The best dynamic range was observed 24 h p.i. for rHRSV-Luc, while the rHRSV-mCherry fluorescent signal was higher at 48 h p.i.. For both viruses the signals were more variable and even decreased after 72 h of infection, probably due to viral cytopathic effect. The dynamic was better for Luc compared with mCherry, with linear RLU values extending over 43 orders of magnitude (log 10 ). There was a strong correlation between the viral dose and luciferase activity. From these results, inocula of 500 and 1,000 p.f.u. per well of 96-well plates were then used for further assays for rHRSV-Cherry and rHRSV-Luc, respectively, and fluorescence and luminescence were read at 48 h p.i. and 24 h p.i., respectively (arrows in Fig. 3a,b) .",

Serially diluted inhibitors were added to viral inocula and incubated on HEp-2 cells for 24 (luminescence) or 48 h (fluorescence). Luciferase and mCherry signals were measured to assess inhibition of viral replication. Both fluorescence and luminescence signals decreased while increasing RSV inhibitor concentrations, whereas control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) had no effect (Fig. 4a,b) . Effect of compounds on mCherry expression in rHRSV-Cherry-infected cells is obvious using a fluorescence microscope (Fig. 4c) and is measurable with a fluorescent plate reader (Fig. 4b) . Reduction of luciferase activity (Fig. 4a ) or mCherry fluorescence (Fig. 4b) in rHRSV-Luc-or rHRSV-Cherry-infected cells treated with the two compounds allowed the determination of the half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values for both inhibitors. For AZD4316, the observed EC 50 values were 1.0 nM for rHRSV-Cherry and 1.7 nM for rHRSV-Luc, consistent with its EC 50 of 2-40 nM against different HRSV strains in a 3-day infection assay 23 . For AZ-27, the observed EC 50 values were 28 and 38 nM with rHRSV-Cherry and rHRSV-Luc, respectively, similar to the published EC 50 of about 10 nM with HRSV strain A2 (refs 25,26) . To compare this method with a classical method, the EC 50 of AZ-27 and AZD4316 were also determined by the plaque reduction assay using rHRSV (Fig. 4d) . The observed EC 50 , 14 and 0.6 nM for AZ-27 and AZD4316, respectively, were in the same range as those determined by luminescent or fluorescent assays. The 50% cytotoxic concentration values obtained with HEp-2 cells, 4250 mM for AZ-27 and about 50 mM for AZD4316, were much higher than the EC 50 values.",

            "text": "Real-time in vivo imaging of RSV infection. The recent development of highly sensitive cameras has enabled the use of luciferase reporter viruses for in vivo imaging studies of viral replication and spread. To apply this approach to RSV, we used rHRSV-Luc in an attempt to visualize RSV replication in the mouse model. BALB/c mice were infected with the reporter virus via intranasal (IN) inoculation with 5 \u00c2 10 4 p.f.u. and in vivo bioluminescence intensity was determined daily (Fig. 5a ). Mice were anaesthetized and observed alive using the IVIS imaging system 5 min after IN injection of D-luciferin. Compared with intraperitoneal (IP) injection, IN instillation of luciferin confers a one to two orders of magnitude increase in luciferase bioluminescence detection in both lung and nose 27 The HDV ribozyme is shown as a curved black line and the T7 transcription terminator as a small blue box. The sequences of junctions between the T7 promoter (arrow) and the leader sequence, and between the HDV ribozyme (curved line) and the trailer sequence are shown in the enlargements. The 11 DNA fragments that were assembled are numbered as in Table 1 . The full-length HRSV cDNA was assembled into a reverse genetic vector using additional restriction sites introduced in the intergenic regions (in black) or naturally present in the HRSV genome sequence (in grey). The SalI cleavage site introduced in the L gene was silent at the amino-acid level. (b) The mCherry or firefly luciferase gene was inserted between P and M gene together with an upstream gene end (GE) and a downstream gene start (GS) signals as described in Methods. Fig. 1 ). The weight (Fig. 5b) and temperature (not shown) of animals were also measured and no signs of morbidity were observed. Bioluminescence was observed in the respiratory tract only, and detected as early as 3 d.p.i. both in the snout and in the lungs of rHRSV-Luc-infected animals. Maximum bioluminescence was observed at 3 d.p.i. in the snout, while light output peaked on days 4 and 5 for lungs and remained detectable for at least 7 days after initiating the infection (Fig. 5a) . No bioluminescence was observed for mice infected with WT HRSV (Fig. 5a ). Left and right lungs were equivalently infected ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). It is remarkable that in our primo-infection experiments with the Long strain, using low amounts of RSV infectious particles, RSV replication was clearly visualized, although no significant weight loss nor other clinical sign was observed with either WT or recombinant rHRSV-Luc virus. To verify that rHRSV-Luc replicated in the respiratory tract only, luciferase activity was quantified on either isolated organs or organ homogenates. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3 , bioluminescence was observed in isolated lungs, but not in liver or spleen. Luciferase activity was also detected with lung but not in liver and spleen homogenates.",

To test whether rHRSV-Luc can be used for in vivo assessment of antiviral drugs, AZD4316 was administered daily as a single oral 50-mg kg \u00c0 1 dose and given 1 h prior to inoculation of virus at day 0, based on the efficacious dose and administration route established for this compound through in vivo study with wt RSV A2 (ref. 24) . Mice were infected with 5 \u00c2 10 4 p.f.u. of rHRSV-Luc and in vivo bioluminescence intensity was determined daily (Fig. 6) . Bioluminescence was strongly reduced in the respiratory tract for mice treated with AZD4316 (159,200\u00b113,636 photons (p) s \u00c0 1 ), whereas mice that received no drug displayed strong bioluminescence (1.2 \u00c2 10 6 \u00b189,500 p s \u00c0 1 ) (Fig. 6a) . Very low signal (83,050 p s \u00c0 1 ) was detected for mock-infected mouse.

Although several molecules have been shown to inhibit RSV replication in vitro (reviewed in ref. 28 ), currently none is available as a commercialized drug (reviewed in ref. 29 ). This is due at least in part to the cumbersome screening systems for RSV that moreover require biosafety level 2 confined facilities. We have developed a new reverse genetics system for RSV allowing easy manipulation of the genome by introducing enzyme restriction sites all along the cDNA in intergenic regions. This construct will allow the easy insertion of other reporter genes, or modifications of individual genes. Two recombinant RSV viruses, expressing either mCherry red fluorescent protein or firefly luciferase reporters, were derived from this construct. Replication rates of the three recombinant viruses, together with the WT virus (Long strain), were roughly similar, showing that the presence of foreign mCherry and Luc genes inserted between P and M transcription units had little effect on virus replication in vitro.",

In most of these viruses, the reporter gene was placed at the 3 0 end of the genome as the first gene expressed. However, van Remmerden et al. 30 noticed that a rHRSV with a EGFP gene placed upstream from NS1 was attenuated compared with a construct with the EGFP gene located between SH and G or WT virus. A similar result was obtained with beta-galactosidase 9 .

            "text": "Reporter gene expression was shown to mirror viral replication and can be used to monitor viral growth, eliminating the timeconsuming fixation and staining steps as well as manual plaque counting. Using reporter gene expression inhibition, we found EC 50 values very similar to those determined with reference methods. These recombinant viruses may be reliable tools to study antiviral drugs for screening as well as advanced characterization. Each of these recombinants has its own advantages and disadvantages for automated high-throughput screenings. The rHRSV-Cherry virus requires a fluorescent plate reader but no consumable except plastic dishes and cell culture media. On the other hand, the rHRSV-Luc virus requires a luminometer and reaction substrates for the luciferase assay, and is thus more expensive, but also more sensitive and more accurate, with greater dynamic range and lower background. The rHRSV-Luc readout can also be performed on stored frozen plates (after cell lysis) for several days, allowing for batch analyses. It may also be coupled with a cell viability assay relaying on R. luciferase activity to assess both drug toxicity and efficacy in the same assay. Our recombinant RSVs, expressing either mCherry or firefly luciferase (Luc) have two advantages over other reporter constructs for both in vitro and in vivo studies. First, the background of red fluorescence is generally lower than for green fluorescence, particularly in organ tissues. Thus, rHRSV-Cherry could be useful for in vivo identification of target cells for RSV replication in the lung other than epithelial cells. Second, firefly Luc allows in vivo studies, as shown in this work, when using the BALB/c mouse model and a charge-coupled device camera, the consumables being relatively cheap. Compared with R. luciferase, the Luc activity is more stable, and the substrate can be administered by the nasal route. These two new recombinant viruses could constitute useful and complementary tools for future screening assays. Indeed, rHRSV-Cherry could be more convenient for the first steps of high-throughput screening assays, whereas rHRV-Luc should be more useful for precise determination of EC 50 and quantification of the exact level of RSV replication in the presence of drugs. More recently, a new technology allowing real-time tracking of cell invasion by RSV in cultured HEp-2 cells was described 31 . This technology is based on prior RSV surface labelling with biotin and revelation by gold nanoparticles combined to streptavidin using dark-field microscopy. Since gold-labelled RSV particles are still infectious, this approach is well adapted for studying the cell invasion process by RSV or its inhibition by drugs targeting the fusion process. However, in contrast to our recombinant viruses, this methodology cannot be applied to screening of drugs targeting the viral polymerase, large-scale screenings or in vivo studies.",

Here we have shown that the recombinant virus rHRSV-Luc can be used in living mice to monitor virus replication using a non-invasive imaging technique. Since luminescence was detected in all rHRSV-Luc-infected mice, and since the same living animal can be monitored at different time points, the number of animals needed to collect sufficient data can be reduced to 3 or 4 mice per experiment. This is to our knowledge the first report of in vivo imaging of RSV replication. RSV replication was detected in the snout and lungs of living mice, as previously described 32 . Since we used 10-1,000-fold-less infectious particles per mouse than usually used 7 , these results also show how sensitive the readout is for RSV replication using the Luc assay. Since clinical signs are very moderate in mice experimentally infected with HRSV, with low-to-moderate histopathology associated with moderate viral replication, our in vivo imaging technique adapted to RSV is a really powerful, practical and easy to use approach to follow RSV replication. Furthermore, it allows the release of laborious techniques such as qRT-PCR that requires animal killing.",

To construct a full-length cDNA clone of HRSV subgroup A, strain Long (GenBank accession: AY911262), non-cutting enzymes (KpnI, BspEI, MluI, StuI, BstEII, SalI, BstBI), or unique cutting enzymes (XhoI, BamHI) in the HRSV cDNA were identified. A polylinker containing the designed restriction sites with a downstream HDV ribozyme sequence followed by a T7 transcription terminator, and an upstream T7 promoter was inserted into the low-copy vector pACNR1180 (ref. 22) (a kind gift of Dr Jon-Duri Tratschin, Institute of Virology and Immunoprophylaxis, Mittelh\u00e4usern, Switzerland) at the SmaI restriction site. Random-primed cDNA synthesis was done using SuperscriptII (Gibco-BRL) and 1 mg of total cytoplasmic RNA isolated from HEp-2 cells infected with the human RSV subgroup A, Long strain (ATCC VR-26). PCR was performed on cDNA using high-fidelity Pfu Ultra Polymerase (5U; Stratagene) and specific primers (Table 1) to amplify 11 fragments covering the whole RSV genome (Genbank accession no.: AY911262.1) using standard procedures. The complete HRSV genome was sequenced using two independent PCR products for each fragment and was used as a reference. The BamHI and BstBI restriction sites present in the G cDNA sequence of our HRSV strain were destroyed by sitedirected mutagenesis without modifying the amino-acid sequence. The KpnI, BspEI, MluI, StuI, BstEII and SalI restriction sites, absent from the HRSV cDNA, were placed in the NS2/N, N/P, P/M and G/M2 intergenic regions, respectively. Unique SacII and BstBI sites were introduced in the Leader and Trailer sequences, respectively, and a unique SalI site was placed into the variable region 2 of L 21 . The SacII site was destroyed thereafter by site-directed mutagenesis. The construction of a full-length HRSV cDNA clone resulted in a total of 16 nucleotide changes in the intergenic regions. The amplified fragments were cloned into separate pJET2.1 vectors (Fermentas) and the sequences were verified. The antigenomic cDNA spanning the entire HRSV genome was assembled into a single molecule by sequential ligation of RSV cDNA fragments into the pACNR1180-derived vector by standard subcloning techniques. The Leader end was constructed to abut the promoter for T7 RNA polymerase, and the Trailer end was constructed to be adjacent to the autocatalytic HDV ribozyme sequence. The resulting vector, pACNR-rHRSV, generates a positive sense, antigenomic RNA transcript with three additional G residues at its 5 0 terminus, but leaving the exact 3 0 native terminus. The positions and sequences of the alterations due to restriction site insertions are listed in Table 1 .",
