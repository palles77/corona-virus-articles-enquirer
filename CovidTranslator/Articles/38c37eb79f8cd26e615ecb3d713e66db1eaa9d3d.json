We have, therefore, validated a QPCR assay for quantification of a viral aerosol sample using the double-stranded DNA-binding dye SYBR green I, an economical alternative for quantification of target microorganisms. To achieve this objective we used mycobacteriophage D29 as model organism. Phage D29 aerosol was produced in an aerosol cabinet and then collected by use of an AGI liquid sampler. A standard curve was created by use of purified genomic DNA from the phage in liquid culture of known concentration measured by titration. To prevent false-positive results caused by formation of primer-dimers, an additional data-acquisition step was added to the three-step QPCR procedure; the new technique was called four-step QPCR. The standard curve was then used to quantify the total amount of phage D29 in liquid culture and aerosol samples. For liquid culture samples there was no significant difference (P [ 0.05) between results from quantification of the virus using double-agar culture and QPCR. For aerosol samples, however, the result determined by the QPCR method was significantly (P \\ 0.05) higher than that from the double-agar culture method. The four-step SYBR green I QPCR method is a quick quantitative method for mycobacteriophage D29 aerosol. We believe that QPCR using SYBR green I dye will be an economical method for detection of airborne bio-aerosols.",

            "text": "The sampling and analysis of airborne microorganisms has attracted much attention in recent years owing to concerns about mold contamination in indoor environments and the threat of bioterrorism. Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Bacillus anthracis, and smallpox virus are causative agents of tularemia, plague, anthrax, and smallpox, respectively. These organisms and others have been listed as possible weapons of mass destruction (WMD), because of their potential to cause acute illness in the exposed public following aerosol release (Stetzenbach et al. 2004) . The 2005 budget allocated to biological terrorism countermeasures by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) alone is over $350 million. Any amount of biowarfare (BW) agents from a few milligrams to several kilograms may be released during a terrorist attack (Sabelnikov et al. 2006) . Although the particles in bio-aerosols are generally 0.3-100 lm in diameter, the inhalable size fraction of 1-10 lm is of primary concern. Exposure to bio-aerosol particles, including airborne infectious agents, indoor allergens, fungal agents, and others, is usually measured by collecting such particles in solid, liquid, or agar media followed by qualitative and/or quantitative sample analysis using microscopic, biochemical, immunochemical, or molecular techniques . Microorganisms are capable of causing health effects whether they are in a culturable or non-culturable state. Culture also requires time for the organisms to grow into recognizable colonies, often taking days to weeks, depending on the microorganism. Light microscopy is tedious and lacks identification specificity, unless accompanied by specialized staining or immunological assay. Biochemical assays that measure (1,3)-c-D-glucan and ergosterol indicate the presence of fungal biomass (Goto et al. 1994; Rylander 1999) which is useful in assessing the overall levels of fungal contamination, but these indicators do not reveal the presence of specific organisms. The inaccuracy of classical methods, lack of specificity, and lengthy analysis time required to characterize airborne bio-contaminant concentrations and populations emphasize the need to develop new sampling and analysis techniques that can provide rapid, reliable data for bioaerosol exposure.",

            "text": "The use of molecular methods, for example quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) amplification, can enhance monitoring strategies by increasing sensitivity and specificity while reducing the time required for analysis. QPCR is evolving into a promising tool capable of reproducible and accurate measurement of total microorganism concentrations in environmental samples. The advantage of QPCR is its capacity for rapid sample quantification and species-specific identification. Furthermore, unlike conventional PCR, QPCR does not require post-PCR analysis, for example gel-electrophoresis. This detection system combines a thermal cycler and an optical module. At the end of the extension phase of each PCR cycle the optical module measures the fluorescence intensity of each cycle generated either by hybridization probes (TaqMan, molecular beacon, or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)) or by double-stranded DNA dyes such as Sybrgreen green (SYBR) (O'Mahony and Hill 2002; Stetzenbach et al. 2004) . The data analysis software provided with a QPCR system calculates a threshold based on background fluorescence, and determines the cycle number (CT) at which the fluorescence in the sample crosses this threshold. The CT is inversely correlated with the concentration of the microorganism in the sample. By using known microorganism concentrations as templates, standard curves can be produced to quantify total target microorganism concentrations in an unknown sample. This method has been successfully used for detection of airborne microorganisms in environmental samples (Meklin et al. 2007; Vesper et al. 2005; Zeng et al. 2004 Zeng et al. , 2006 Pyankov et al. 2007; Hietala et al. 2005; Haugland et al. 1999 Haugland et al. , 2002 . Sequence-specific fluorescencelabeled probes (e.g., TaqMan) have been regarded as a conventional detection method in many diagnostic and research applications but are not suitable for quantification of a large number of different sequences, because a new and relatively expensive probe is usually required for each amplicon under investigation. We have therefore optimized and validated a QPCR assay for accurate quantification of aerosol samples using the double-stranded DNAbinding dye SYBR green I, a much more economical alternative for quantification of target microorganisms. The main objective of the work discussed in this paper was to develop a QPCR detection system for quantification of a viral aerosol sample using SYBR green I. For this purpose, we used mycobacteriophage D29 as model organism and developed standard curves by using purified genomic DNA from known liquid phage culture titrated to a certain CT value determined by QPCR. The standard curves were then used to quantify the amount of total phage D29 in liquid culture and aerosol samples.",

To eliminate fluorescence signals caused by generation of primerdimers, the assay was optimized by lowering the primer concentrations and redesigning the primers, but none of the specific amplifications still appeared.

Unfortunately, these dyes detect all doublestranded DNA (dsDNA), including primer-dimers and other undesired products. The specificity of the method is determined entirely by its primers, because the presence of any dsDNA can generate fluorescence. We observed accumulation of primer-dimers (PD) in low-template samples and even in no-template-control (NTC) tubes when using the three-step program. This might obscure the true result in quantitative assays using genetic DNA dyes, especially for samples in which the gene of D29 is of low abundance and PD are readily formed. Extensive PD formation during quantitative three-step QPCR in NTCs has not been intensively considered yet, probably because most assays use a TaqMan probe that does not detect this kind of nonspecific amplification (Meklin et al. 2007; Vesper et al. 2005; Zeng et al. 2004 Zeng et al. , 2006 Pyankov et al. 2007; Hietala et al. 2005 ). In the fourstep NTC reactions, no amplification of PD was observed compared with the presence of PDs in the three-step NTCs. Four-step SYBR green I QPCR thus eliminated fluorescence readings caused by generation of primer-dimers and quantified phage D29 in both liquid culture and aerosol samples. SYBR green I Fig. 5 Standard curve of phage D29 by four-step QPCR is, perhaps, a suitable choice for accurate and reproducible real-time measurements of aerosol samples. Obscuring PD observed in three-step QPCR reactions were eliminated by use of the four-step procedure; this was shown to be a prerequisite for accurate QPCR and facilitated primer design. Impingement collection enables processing of the sample by dilution or concentration to maximize accuracy in quantification. A liquid sample can also be used with a variety of analytical methods, including culture, microscopy, immunoassay, flow cytometry, and molecular methods. In our study an AGI sampler was used to collect the phage D29 aerosol. The sensitivity of the QPCR method was much higher than that of the cultivation method. The reason may be that during the collection period the impingement sampling stress destroyed the structure and the decrease of phage D29 in the aerosol state thereby reduced the viability of collected phage D29. The QPCR method detected all of the phage D29 whether it was dead or alive whereas the double-agar cultivation method only detected the live phage D29. The QPCR method does not underestimate the total quantity of the target virus in the same way as the cultivation method when performing risk assessment. Unlike bacteria, viruses are sensitive and fragile and needed the optimized sample method to reduce impingement sampling stress and increase virus viability when collecting the virus aerosol.",

            "text": "The TaqMan assay is based on measuring the fluorescence released during PCR as the 5 0 -nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase cleaves a duallabeled fluorescent hybridization probe, designed to bind inside the amplified region, during primer extension. SYBR green I is an intercalating dye that gives a fluorescence signal when bound to doublestranded DNA, while being otherwise virtually nonfluorescent. SYBR green I lacks the specificity of the TaqMan assay, in which the fluorescent signal is derived from a specific probe. However, in several published studies comparisons have been made between the two methods, and it has been shown that the specificity of SYBR green assays can approach that of Taqman probe assays if the primers are carefully selected and the assays thoroughly optimized (Ravva and Stanker 2005; Maeda et al. 2003; Malinen et al. 2003; Ponchel et al. 2003; Arikawa et al. 2008) . SYBR green I can be applied to fluorescence monitoring of any amplification reaction, which gives more flexibility to the real-time PCR. It is widely used because of the ease in designing the assays and its relatively low setup and running costs. Unlike TaqMan fluorescent probes, SYBR green dye intercalates into double-stranded DNA to monitor the amplification of target gene specifically initiated by gene-specific primers. One drawback of SYBR green assays, however, is that the dye is non-specific and can generate false positive signals if non-specific products or primer-dimers are present in the assay. Those problems can be addressed by carefully designing the primers and validating the PCR products with dissociation curve analysis immediately after PCR. In addition, other approaches have been practiced to further increase the specificity of the SYBR green detection, for example a ''hot start'' strategy using a DNA polymerase that requires heat activation, or acquisition of fluorescence signals at a temperature slightly below the melting temperature of the desired amplicon but above which nonspecific primer-dimer related products will denature and produce minimal signals (Arikawa et al. 2008) .",

The sensitivity of the QPCR-based method is considered one of the highest. It is considered one of the most promising techniques for real-time identification of airborne microorganisms. In contrast with airborne fungi, there are only a few papers describing detection of viral aerosols by use of QPCR (Weesendorp et al. 2008; Pyankov et al. 2007; Hietala et al. 2005) . Recent bioterrorism events, emerging infectious diseases, for example SARS-COV, and concern about fungal contaminants in indoor environments have increased the need for enhanced detection of airborne microorganisms. This study established a preliminary procedure for detecting virus aerosols by four-step SYBR green I real-time PCR. This method is a much more economical alternative to Taqman probe QPCR for quantification of target microorganisms. This study was performed in a laboratory experimental environment and had no field background and little genomic complexity. The methods developed in this work need further study in an actual field environment and could then serve as rapid, specific, and sensitive means of detection of virus aerosols and could thus facilitate investigations of their distribution, ecology, and clinical diagnosis, and assessment of risk from exposure.",
