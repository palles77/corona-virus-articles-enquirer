            "text": "Alpinia officinarum Hance (Zingiberaceae), known as lesser galangal, is a wellknown medicinal herb distributed in East Asia whose rhizomes are used for stomachic, analgesic, and antiemetic treatment [1] . The plant grows several feet tall and has long leaves and reddish-white flowers. Alpinia officinarum is widely cultivated throughout China, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The species is native to Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, where it occurs in tropical and subtropical climates. Alpinia is the largest genus of about 230 species in Zingiberaceae. Historically, its rhizomes possess stimulant and digestive effects owing to their spicy flavor and aromatic scent, and as a result, it is widely used in curries and perfumes throughout Asia. Although it was previously used throughout Europe, its use has declined in recent years, and it is now mainly used in Eastern Europe. Homoeopaths use it as a stimulant. The rhizomes of A. officinarum have been used in traditional Japanese herbal prescriptions (Kampo medicine) mainly for dyspepsia, vomiting, flatulence, stomach trouble, and diarrhea. The plant is also used in traditional Chinese medicine as an aphrodisiac, abortifacient, carminative, antipyretic, antiinflammatory, and emmenagogue, as well as to treat disorders of the heart and kidneys, bronchitis, chronic enteritis, renal calculus, diabetes, and rheumatism. Furthermore, its rhizomes are used in various Asian cuisines (for example, in Thai and Lao tom yum and tom kha gai soups, Vietnamese Hu cuisine and throughout Indonesian cuisine). The rhizomes contain numerous active constituents, including essential oils [2] , resin [3] , flavonoids [4] , diarylheptanoids [5] , and phenylpropanoids [6, 7] . As the main components distributed in this genus, diarylheptanoids possess cytotoxic, antiemetic, antiinflammatory, antivirus, and antiproliferative activities. The rhizomes of A. officinarum are an important medicinal herb recorded in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese Pharmacopoeias [8] [9] [10] . In this chapter, we discuss the biological activity of natural diarylheptanoids isolated from A. officinarum, as well as synthetic diarylheptanoids.",

The other differences in structures lie in the pattern of substitution on aromatic rings.

            "text": "Chronic inflammation may be a causative factor in a variety of cancers. The longer the inflammation persists, the higher the risk of cancer. In general, inflammatory leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils provide soluble factors that are thought to mediate the development of inflammation-associated cancer, including the cancer cells themselves, although other cells also participate. Inflammatory mediators include metabolites of arachidonic acid, cytokines, chemokines, and free radicals. Chronic exposure to these mediators leads to increased cell proliferation, mutagenesis, oncogene activation, and angiogenesis. Emphasis will be placed on examining the role of the reactive oxygen (eg, O 2 \u2212 ) and nitrogen intermediates (eg, NO), cytokines (eg, interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)), and prostaglandins (PGs). Increased cancer incidence is associated with increased duration of inflammation. Animal models have demonstrated experimentally that chronic inflammation can lead to the development of various forms of cancer, while providing further insights into possible mechanisms. Skin tumors are induced by administration of carcinogens such as 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), followed by repeated administration of tumor promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) [53] . In recent publications, we discussed the inflammatory and tumor promotion, and its inhibitors from naturally occurring compounds [54, 55] .",

Treatment with methanol extracts of the rhizomes of A. officinarum caused an 85% reduction in the average number of tumors per mouse at week 20 ( Fig. 4 .9B).

            "text": "Sawamura et al. [61, 62] examined the antiinfluenza virus activity and cytotoxicity of 10 diarylheptanoids (2, 4, 6, 21, 24, 30, 32, 35, 36, and 49) isolated from A. officinarum by plaque reduction assay and MTT assay, respectively, using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (Table 4 .4). In this study, influenza virus was more susceptible to 6 (EC 50 = 2.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcg/mL) and 32 (EC 50 = 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcg/mL) than to the others, and their therapeutic indexes (CC 50 / ED 50 ) were 11.7 and 114.3, respectively [61] . Compound 32 has a 4-hydroxylphenyl moiety. Platyphyllone and platyphyllone-5-xylopyranoside contain two 4-hydroxyphenyl moieties and have been reported to be active against influenza virus with therapeutic indexes of >10 [64] . Thus, hydroxylation at the C-4 position of the phenyl moiety may be important for antiinfluenza virus activity in vitro. However, in a murine influenza virus infection model, 6 significantly reduced virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of the lungs and prolonged survival times of the infected mice without toxicity, whereas 32 did not show this activity [62] . Compound 6 possessed an unsaturated ketone and a methoxy group at the C-5 position of the 4-hydroxyphenyl moiety, but 32 did not. Thus, the ketone and methoxy groups may be necessary for antiinfluenza activity in vivo. Compound 6 exhibited antiviral activity against H1N1 virus, H3N2 virus, and B type virus, as well as oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 virus [62] . This indicates that the mode of antiinfluenza virus action of 6 was different from that of the known agents, such as oseltamivir, and suggests that it is a candidate antiviral compound against more virulent strains than the pandemic H1N1. In fact, 6 was shown to have no effect on virus adsorption or invasion into cells, instead suppressing the expression of viral messenger RNA and antigens in infected MDCK cells [62] . It is probable that 6 selectively suppressed influenza virus mRNA synthesis in infected cells without cytotoxicity [62] . Diarylheptanoids isolated from Alpinia katsumadai such as katsumadain A and (E,E)-5-hydroxy-1,7-diphenyl-4,6-heptadien-3-one are reported to have inhibitory activity against the neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus (A/PR/8/34) in vitro [65] . Some diarylheptanoids isolated from A. officinarum may therefore be effective in reducing NA activity.",

The EC 50 values of 4 and 66 were 5.0 \u00b1 0.0 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bcg/mL (Table 4 .4), respectively, and both compounds showed antiviral activity against the A2 strain of RSV with therapeutic indexes of 4.6 and 14.3, respectively, and were more potent than the other tested compounds [44, 66] . Compound 4 was also active against influenza virus with an EC 50 value of <10 \u03bcg/mL [61] , which suggests that 4 is an effective diarylheptanoid against both RSV and influenza virus in vitro. Compounds 22 and 22/32 were synthesized as an enantiomer and racemate, respectively, of 32, and compound 66 was synthesized as the enantiomer of 35 (Fig. 4.10 ) [44] . The therapeutic indexes of stereoisomers (22, 32 , and 22/32) were similar (CC 50 /EC 50 : 1.3, 2.1, and 3.4, respectively) and their EC 50 values were 44.7 \u00b1 1.5, 40.7 \u00b1 3.5, and 24.3 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcg/mL (Table  4 .4), respectively [44] . However, the therapeutic indexes of 35 and 66 (6.1 and 14.3) were higher than those of the three stereoisomers, with the EC 50 values of 16.3 \u00b1 3.5 and 7.0 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bcg/mL, respectively [44, 66] . The C-5 position of 35 and 66 is methoxylated with a saturated ketone at the C-3 position. Compound 30 also contained a methoxy group with a saturated ketone and its EC 50 value was 13.3 \u00b1 3.8 \u03bcg/mL [66] . Thus, methoxylation in diarylheptanoids may contribute to anti-RSV activity in vitro. In a murine intranasal RSV infection model, compounds 22, 32, 22/32, and 66 were significantly effective in reducing virus titers, infiltration of lymphocytes and interferon-\u03b3 levels (marker of pneumonia severity) in the lungs of mice [44] . Among these, 66 showed the strongest anti-RSV activity in mice, as shown by anti-RSV assay in vitro, and this may be a lead compound for the development of anti-RSV drugs in the future.",

Conventional or allopathic medicines used to treat obesity have high abuse potential and frequently exhibit side effects. Few botanicals included in natural weight loss products have been thoroughly researched on a basic or clinical level, and it is thus imperative to validate their widespread consumption for weight management. Many natural weight loss products are sold and used globally with little or no proof of efficacy and quality, and concerns regarding safety have surfaced with good reason. Orlistat inhibits pancreatic and gastric lipases that catalyze the hydrolysis of ingested fats, resulting in reduced dietary fat absorption and high fecal fat excretion [70] . It is certain that orlistat has a marked drug effect, as 35-45% of energy intake in Western diets is attributed to dietary fat. However, malabsorption of fat leads to rather uncomfortable side effects, such as flatus with discharge, oil spotting from the rectum, fecal incontinence, fecal urgency, loose or liquid stools, and malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins [70] .",

Therefore, inhibitors of this enzymatic conversion may be useful in the selective treatment of androgen-dependent diseases, such as benign prostate hyperplasia, male pattern baldness, and acne. Most 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors are steroids binding to the steroid receptors, and these steroids may produce various undesirable hormonal effects acting as agonists or antagonists. It has been reported that diarylheptanoids possess inhibitory activity against 5\u03b1-reductase. The SAR of four diarylheptanoids (2, 22, 24, and 31) from A. officinarum was discussed [13] . It has been suggested that diarylheptanoids with unsaturated bonds, particularly the conjugated form in the alkyl structural moiety between the two aryl groups, had weak inhibitory activity, while diarylheptanoids with saturated counterpart bonds had potent inhibitory activity. Thus, the alkyl parts of the diarylheptanoids appear to be important structural moieties for inhibitory activity against 5\u03b1-reductase.",

            "text": "These polysome-associated mRNAs are then applied to ribosome-protection assay, and the resulting segments of RNA are sequenced using next-generation sequencers (ribosome profiling). In these analyses, active and stalled ribosomes have been shown to cosediment during isolation of polysome complexes through sucrose gradients [83] , thus indicating that polysome profiling does not fully distinguish translationally active from repressed mRNAs. Diarylheptanoids 6, 24, and 30 inhibit proinflammatory mediators and exhibit cytotoxic and antiviral activities. However, the precise mechanisms of action and their effects on expression of specific genes are unknown. Thus, we used translatome analysis to investigate the mechanisms and modes of action of these diarylheptanoids [84] . Polysome-associated mRNAs were prepared from diarylheptanoid-treated and control cells from a human B lymphoblastoid cell line; these mRNA samples were then used for microarray analysis. The number of downregulated inflammatory-related transcripts was ranked as follows: 30 > 24 > 6. Compound 6 showed greater influence on the translatome of BJAB cells, while 24 showed less efficacy, except when upregulating the expression of genes related to rhodopsin-like GPCRs, mRNA processing, and proteasomerelated proteins of WiKiPathways [85] . It is possible that the same host factors, such as splicing factors or hnRNPs listed in mRNA processing WP411 45374 (WP; WiKiPathways), affect virus structure and/or replication. Sixteen transcripts were upregulated after treatment with 6, 24, or 30. Among these, transcripts of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (C1/C2), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, non-POU domain containing, octamer-binding, and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 were identified as internal ribosome entry site trans-acting factors. All of these studies have provided new insights into the mode of action of diarylheptanoids from A. officinarum with regard to its antiinflammatory, antitumor promotion, and antiviral effects.",

Several active components have been isolated, and their chemical structures have been and continue to be determined. The diarylheptanoids of the rhizomes of A. officinarum are considered to be a particularly promising group of compounds. Diarylheptanoids are minor but ubiquitous components in our diet and have the advantage of being nontoxic or relatively nontoxic to humans. Natural diarylheptanoids have multiple physiological functions, including antiinflammatory, antitumor, cancer preventive, antiviral, antiemetic, and anti-pylori effects. Challenges that must be overcome in order to find functionally useful compounds that can be applied clinically are further screening of natural diarylheptanoid compounds, examination of SARs, elucidation of physiological action mechanisms, and the problems associated with supplying large quantities of compounds. In order to resolve these issues, collaboration between researchers in various fields will be necessary.",
