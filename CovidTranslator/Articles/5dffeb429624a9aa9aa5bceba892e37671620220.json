In the United States, more than one million cases of pneumonias afflict children under the age of 5 years, costing hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The majority of these infections are caused by a handful of common viruses. Knowledge of the epidemiology of these viruses combined with new rapid diagnostic techniques will provide faster and more reliable diagnoses in the future. Although the basic clinical epidemiology of these viruses has been carefully investigated over the last 30 years, new molecular techniques are greatly expanding our understanding of these agents and the diseases they cause. Antigenic and genetic variations are being discovered in many viruses previously thought to be homogeneous. The exact roles and the biological significance of these variations are just beginning to be explored, but already evidence of differences in pathogenicity and immunogenicity has been found in many of these substrains. All of this information clearly will impact the development of future vaccines and antiviral drugs. Effective drugs exist for prophylaxis against influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus, and specific therapy exists for influenza A. Ribavirin is approved for use in respiratory synctial virus infections, and it alone or in combination with other agents (eg, IGIV) may be effective in immunocompromised patients, either in preventing the development of pneumonia or in decreasing morbidity and mortality. Many new antiviral agents are being tested and developed, and several are in clinical trials.",

Boys have a higher incidence of LRI for the first 10 years of life and one approximately equal to that of girls through adolescence. 9 The incidence of LRI is highest in the first year of life, peaking at between 30 and 35 cases of LRI per 100 children per year, then gradually decreasing to about 5 per 100 children per year in those 9 to 10 years of age, and staying in this range until later in life. l~ Pneumonia represents only one of many clinical presentations for LRI. It represents on average 29 to 38 percent of pediatric inpatient admissions for LRI and is found in 23 percent of children with LRI treated as outpatients. 9,1H4 However, the age-related incidence of pneumonia does not follow exactly the incidence of LRI (Fig 1) . In the first year of life, pneumonia accounts for only approximately 10 percent of the LRI in children observed in an ambulatory care setting. 9 The incidence increases until it reaches a peak in the second and third years of life (approximately 4 to 5 cases/100 child years), then gradually decreases to 2 cases per 100 child years in the 5 to 9 age group and to about 1 case per 100 child years thereafter, 9, [15] [16] In children hospitalized for LRI, pneumonia accounts for approximately 33 to 50 percent of the causes in the first year of life, then declines somewhat until school age, when it increases to become Seminars in Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Vol 9 the major cause for hospitalizations. 15 ,1%18 However, because the majority of LRI in children occurs in their first 5 years of life, as previously stated, pneumonia comprises about one-third of the total LRI observed in the pediatric age range.",

One of the difficulties in trying to summarize incidence data on these viruses is that great differences exist in study designs. Also, these numbers are limited by each institution's ability and interest in recovering certain viruses, whether an outpatient or inpatient population was studied, the number of years or time of year studied, the ages of the children, and whether they reported or looked for other pathogens or causes for each child's lower respiratory symptoms. As an example, in the United States, the sum of the reported incidences of LRI caused byRSV and HPIV-3 during the first year of life is 33 per 100 children per year. 2829 Because this percentage is almost exactly the reported incidence for LRI in general, not much room is left for the other common pathogens. However, a clear pattern among all of the reported data indicates which viruses consistently cause the most infections and illnesses in young children. This pattern has not changed substantially in over 30 years of observation, and it seems to hold true throughout the world. Clearly, in developed nations, RSV is the largest single pathogen resulting in hospitalization. It also seems to be a major cause of pneumonia in developing countries ( Table 2) . RSV is the most common cause of pneumonia in infants and preschool age children. In young hospitalized infants, it routinely causes about 60 percent of pneumonias, a133,3~ Parainfluenza viruses as a group cause at least as many LRI, but they result in lower hospitalization rates and less pneumonia than does RSV. HPIVs-1 and -3 each cause approximately 10 percent of outpatient pneumonias. However, HPIV-3 results in a higher rate of hospitalization for pneumonia in infants and children and is second only to RSV in young infants. HPIVs-2 and -4 both have been reported to cause pneumonia, but the exact proportion of disease caused by these viruses is unclear. Influenza viruses A and B are the next most frequent causes of pneumonia and vary significantly from year to year. Adenoviruses and rhinoviruses are recovered consistently from children with pneumonia. In young infants, enteroviruses play an important role, whereas influenza becomes more important during the school years. RSV; parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3; influenza A and B; and adenovirus together cause the vast majority of all pneumonia in preschool children and are the major causes of viral pneumonia throughout life.3 t A seasonality to the viruses that cause LRI in children has been well-documented and presented (Fig 2) .9'J2'32 Although one virus predominates within a community, overlap always occurs (Fig 3) . Also, considerable variation takes place in the seventy and exact timing of epidemics between years.",

It belongs to the large paramyxoviridae family of viruses, and thus it can be differentiated morphologically from HPIV, mumps, and measles only by its narrower nucleocapsid. 48 This virus is the number one cause of pediatric hospital admissions for LRI in most areas of the world, 5~ causing almost 100,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States alone) I RSV causes yearly epidemics lasting 3 to 5 months, usually beginning in the early winter or the equivalent rainy season in tropical climates. Most severe disease occurs in children under 1 year of age, with a peak occurring between 2 and 5 months of age, and, as indicated previously, manifests itself as bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Two RSV subtypes (A and B) have been determined mostly by antigenic and genetic differences found in their surface glycoproteins (G and F). 52 Further subgroups of A and B have been described on the basis of antigenic changes on the G protein. 52 Both subtypes circulate in any one year, although often one type predominates. Subtype A strains may be more virulent than are B strains, and they may cause more hospitalization, 53,54 but some investigators have found no difference between subtype strains in type or severity of LRI in children. 55 HPIV Human parainfluenza viruses are separated functionally from RSV by their ability to hemagglutinate red blood cells, a property they share with influenza viruses. Four major virus groups within HP1V (Types 1-4) exist. Further subtypes of HPIV-4 56 and subgroups of HP1V-157-6~ and HPIV-361 have been described.",

This characteristic also allows for the genetic reassortment, which leads to rapid shifts in the antigenic characteristics of the influenza viruses and results in pandemic disease. The three major types of influenza (A, B, and C) are differentiated by stable type-specific ribonucleic acid-associated nucleoprotein. Major subtypes infecting humans are determined by variation in the two surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (H1, H2, and H3) and neuraminidase (N1 and N2). These viruses have many minor antigenic subtypes, with antigenic variations occurring fastest in type A and slowest in type C. Although all three types cause LRI in children, types A and B cause the majority of cases. Influenza epidemics occur each year during the winter, but they vary greatly in their intensity. Also, one type often predominates in anyone year (eg, in 1990-1991, B predominated, and in 1991-1992, A predominated). In years in which influenza type B predominates, increased morbidity in school-age children occurs. 69 Typically, in the early part of the epidemic, influenza infects young school-age children, who then spread it to preschool children and the elderly later in the season. These latter two groups have the highest rates of hospitalization annually (0.5% for infants less than 1 year of age and approximately 0.3% for both children 1 to 4 years and adults over 65 years). 7~ The contribution of influenza to the total cases of viral pneumonia varies year to year and by age, but averages 8 percent. 9,11,12 In preschool age children (1 to 4 years of age), influenza causes all of the typical respiratory syndromes. Very young infants often present with fever only and no specific lower respiratory symptoms. School-age children and adolescents most often present with symptoms of classic influenza with cough, which usually is the only evidence of possible lower respiratory tract involvement. 7~ Influenza may cause a large percentage of the cases of tracheobronchitis in older children?",

All of the children listed in Table 4 should receive the current vaccine starting at about 6 months of age; the vaccine includes two doses during the first year that vaccine is administered if the child is younger than 9 years of age (see Redbook). Any child over 6 months of age may receive the current influenza vaccine (those with allergies to chickens or eggs should be skin tested first). However, the intramuscular route of vaccination has been an impediment to universal vaccination of young children. Live cold-adapted intranasal influenza vaccines have proven to be safe and immunogenic in infants less than 6 months old and also protective in children and adultsf135 These vaccines currently are being tested for efficacy and could lead to universal infant immunization with the additional benefit of decreased disease in adolescents and adults.",
