Detecting community-acquired respiratory-viruses by amplified molecular methods is becoming routine and such results form components of many research studies [1] . Using these technologies, multiple respiratory-viruses can be detected simultaneously within the same symptomatic patient. However, relatively little attention has been given to the detection of respiratory-viruses within asymptomatic populations [2] . Furthermore, the data describing the detection of respiratoryviruses from \"asymptomatic\" individuals often fail to define \"asymptomatic\" or simply report studies from convenient hospital populations without respiratory diagnoses [1] . We utilized highly sensitive PCR assays to evaluate respiratory secretions of healthy adults after screening carefully to insure they did not have immune deficiencies, symptoms of upper respiratory infection (URI), or symptoms that could represent a misinterpreted URI.",

Two different PCR assays analyzed slightly different sets of respiratory viruses [Genmark \u00ae (Carlsbad, CA); Prodesse \u00ae ProFLU\u2122+ (GenProbe, San Diego, CA)]. Manufacturer procedure assays were performed using a certified clinical molecular diagnostics laboratory (Methodist LeBonheur Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Memphis, TN). All assays employed closed, never-opened amplicon tubes, and counter-current sample flowworkflow directionality and other contamination prevention procedures. 124 subjects were analyzed by ProFLU\u2122+ PCR (Influenza A & B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A & B, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and parainfluenza 1,2,3); sixty-six subjects were analyzed by Genmark \u00ae PCR (detecting the same viruses as ProFLU\u2122 + but also detecting parainfluenza 4, rhinovirus, human coronavirus 229E, NL63, HKU1 and OC43, and adenovirus). Subjects sampled after the start of the H1N1 pandemic flu were analyzed by detection chemistries, which included this pathogen.",
