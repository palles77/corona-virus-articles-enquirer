It has been reported that after natural infection in humans and immunization in animals with SARS-CoV vaccine, antibody is produced and persistent for a long period of time. In the present study, mice were immunized i.m. with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine, and three different methods (ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS) were used to evaluate the immune responses when the cells were stimulated in vitro with a pool of peptides overlapping entire SARS spike protein. The results show that prime-immunization with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine can induce both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses. Boosting with the same vaccine enhances CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs and were persistent over two months. The SARS-CoV S-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were CD62L \u2212 , a marker for memory cells, and \u221230 to 50% of the cells expressed IL-7R\u2423 (CD127), a marker for the capacity of effector cells to develop into memory cells. In addition, immunization with the DNA vaccine elicited high levels of antibody production. Taken together, these data demonstrate that immunization with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine can generate antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses that may contribute to long-term protection.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new emerging infectious disease that is caused by a novel coronavirus named as SARS-CoV [1, 2] . The SARS-CoV genome consists of approximately 29,000 bp and encodes four main structure proteins including spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and nucleocapsid protein (N). Among them spike protein is responsible for binding to specific receptor on the susceptible cells. Additionally, the gene sequence of the spike protein is comparably constant [2, 3] . It has been reported that patients infected with SARS-CoV had high levels of antibodies in sera. These antibodies could inhibit the infection of cells with pseudotyped lentiviral particles bearing SARS-CoV S protein and be used to treat SARS-CoV-infected patients [4] [5] [6] [7] . Recently, several reports including ours have demonstrated that SARS-CoV S specific memory CD8 + T cells were generated and maintained in vivo in the patients with fully recovered from SARS-CoV infection [8] [9] [10] . These data indicate that the spike protein is a good target for the vaccine to generate immune responses against the SARS-CoV infection. In animal studies, a number of increasing evidence demonstrated that immunization of animals with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine lead to the generation of long-term neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies are effective in reducing SARS-CoV replication in lungs when mice immunized with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine were then challenged with SARS-CoV [5, 11] . Although it has been reported that CD8 + T cell-mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV S protein in animals are generated after SARS-CoV S DNA vaccination, it remains unclear whether CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are able to become memory cells.",

            "text": "It has been reported that DNA vaccination is a practical and effective way to induce humoral and cellular immune responses and has shown great promise for protective immune responses against several diseases in experimental animal models including HIV, tuberculosis and malaria [15] [16] [17] . In the present study, we have demonstrated that prime-boost immunization of mice with SARS-CoV spike DNA vaccine induces antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses. The cellular immune responses are mediated by both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell. Functional study indicates that antigen-specific cells produced cytokines IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 from CD4 + and CD8 + T cells after short stimulation in vitro with a pool of SARS-S peptides. IFN-\u2425 is an effector cytokine that is able to activate macrophage cells and inhibit viral replication [18] , and IL-2 is a growth factor that probably maintains memory cells and mediates expansion of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [19] . Based on IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 expression, memory T cells are able to divide into three subpopulations including IFN-\u2425 + , IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 + , IL-2 + cells, indicating that memory T cells are composed of distinct functional subsets. Phenotype analysis indicates that SARS-CoV S specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are CD62L \u2212 . Some of the memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells express IL-7R\u2423. These populations of the cells may have the potential differentiate into long-term memory cells [14] . It has been reported that IL-7 is mainly secreted by the stromal cells and plays a key role in sustaining the homeostasis of memory CD8 + T-cell in vivo [20, 21] . In line with other studies, we also find most of the memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were identified in non-lymphoid tissues (lungs) in which these memory T cells are called effector memory cells [22, 23] . Thus, by their location, effector mem-ory T cells can respond rapidly when re-exposed to a pathogen and may play the most important role in the defence when re-encountering a pathogen. Furthermore, the function of non-lymphoid effector memory cells has been demonstrated in a study in which Sendai virus specific memory CD4 + T cells persist in the lungs, and transfer of these cells into \u24242-microglobulin-dificient mice confers a significant level of protection against re-infection [24] . Consistent with our observations, several reports demonstrate that natural infection in humans induces memory CD8 + T cells responses [10] . Moreover, immunization of mice with adno-vector encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV S protein generates two H-2 brestricted epitopes and one H-2 d -restricted epitopes of CD8 + T cells [25] . In addition, Yang et al., reported that vaccination of mice with SARS-CoV S DNA generated cellular and humoral immunity to SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. The neutralizing antibody can inhibit SARS-CoV replication and results in protective immunity in a murine challenge model. In adoptive transfer study, they found that antibodies but not Fig. 6 . SARS-CoV S protein-specific antibody responses following DNA vaccination. BALB/c mice were immunized i.m. as described in Section 2. Sera from normal and immunized mice were collected at day 7 after boost vaccination. Antibody titers in sera were determined at different dilutions by ELISA specific for SARS-S protein. Data are expressed as the mean value \u00b1 S.D. for each group. A non-parametric two-tailed t-test was used for statistical analysis with similar result; * P < 0.01.",
