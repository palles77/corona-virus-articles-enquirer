COVID-19 patients may develop mild or severe symptoms after infection. The mild patients show symptoms of fever, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, fatigue, radiographic evidence of pneumonia; most of them appear to have a good prognosis. In contrast, some patients may develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure [8] [9] [10] [11] . Importantly, in most moribund patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection is also associated with an inflammatory cytokine storm 4, 12 , which is mainly characterized by elevated plasma concentrations of interleukins 6 (IL-6). Indeed, several recent COVID-19 clinical studies all indicated that interleukins 6 levels is higher in severe group than those of mild group [12] [13] [14] [15] , suggesting that IL-6 might be used as a biomarker for severity evaluation. However, how the IL-6 level is quantitatively correlated with moribund patients is still unknown.",

Our data strongly suggest that both RNAaemia and high IL-6 level were exclusively observed in critically ill patients, which prompt us to further study the relation between them. As shown in Figure 3A , patients with RNAaemia exhibited much higher IL-6 level compared with other patients. We then checked the IL-6 value in each of the RNAaemia patients, strikingly, all of their IL-6 value were more than 100 (Table S1 ). In order to further confirm the relation between them, we firstly analyze the IL-6 value in the critically ill patients, notably, the mortality appeared to be correlated with IL-6 value \u2265100 because all of the death in this study were belong to this group (Table S1), we therefore define IL-6 value \u2265100 as high and the rest of cases as low, the IL-6 high patients accounted for 35.3% in critically ill group ( Figure   3B ). As shown in Table 3 , the incidence of RNAaemia was closely correlated with IL-6 high in critically ill patients (R=0.902). These data clearly suggested that RNAaemia was related with poor prognosis, indeed, all the RNAaemia patients were at higher risk of multiple organs impairment compared to those patients without RNAaemia (Figure 4A-C) .",

In this study, we investigated the distribution of serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive cases in various patients groups, and the result showed that those cases all were confirmed only in critically ill patients group. Moreover, the laboratory data analysis strongly suggest that inflammatory cytokine IL-6 level was significantly elevated in critically ill patients.

This observation might help to explain that why serum SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was only able to be detected in patients with extremely high level of IL-6. We still could not rule out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 virus amount grow explosively in a short period, which in turn induced the massive cytokine storm that characterized by elevated level of cytokines such as IL-6.
