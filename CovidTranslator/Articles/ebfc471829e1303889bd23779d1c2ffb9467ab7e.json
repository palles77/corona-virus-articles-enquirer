            "text": "Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. Methods: Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. Results: None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cordlike shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. Conclusions: The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging. Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.",

Although more widespread transmission of the SARS virus was successfully prevented, owing to inadequate experience with outbreaks of this nature at the time, SARS-CoV still caused more than 8000 infections leading to 774 deaths. [12] The typical clinical manifestations of SARS included sudden fever (usually >38\u00b0C) accompanied by chills or headache, myalgia, fatigue, and coughing. Some patients also developed significant respiratory distress within a short period. Laboratory tests showed either a normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell count. Imaging showed focal or patch-like shadows or reticular exudates, although this did rapidly progress to diffuse consolidations in some patients. [13] In the present cohort of patients, the typical initial symptoms of NCP were primarily fever, most of which were high fevers that occurred within several days and were not alleviated by routine anti-infective drugs. However, some middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities only developed a moderate, low, or no fever during the disease course. In addition, some patients suffered from fatigue and dry cough on disease onset. Nevertheless, these atypical initial symptoms deserve similar attention with the more common symptoms. For example, there have been reports of patients with NCP presenting with diarrhea as the initial symptom of disease onset. [14] Some patients presented with elevated troponin levels and myocarditis. [15] Others developed headache, myalgia, and other symptoms similar to those of influenza. [14] It should be emphasized that the author observed that some patients in the outpatient clinic even had no obvious symptoms, or came to see the doctor only with \"discomfort.\" Moreover, a previous study reported that one asymptomatic patient was diagnosed 2019-nCoV infection [16] ; therefore, the presence of asymptomatic carriers requires due attention, and relevant contacts should be tracked and isolated as soon as possible. In this study, routine peripheral blood tests showed either normal or decreased white blood cell counts and lymphocytopenia, as well as elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, all of which are generally consistent with previous reports of patients with NCP. [3] In these patients, early-stage lung CT scans mostly showed multiple, small patch-like shadows, and interstitial changes, which were more obvious in the extrapulmonary region. These shadows subsequently progressed to multiple ground-glass opacities in both lungs, along with infiltration shadows with a \"large white lung\" observed in more severe cases. The median interval from the onset of initial symptoms to dyspnea was 7 days. In some severe cases, the disease rapidly progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, and coagulation disorder, eventually leading to death.",

[12, 17] Moreover, there are some other notable epidemiologic differences between the two outbreaks. For example, most of the critically ill SARS patients were young adults who required invasive ventilation for treatment, whereas most of the critically ill patients included in this study were middle-aged and elderly people. This age difference may have contributed to the poor prognosis in some cases. Thus, the proportion of young adult patients with SARS with moderate and severe disease was substantially higher than that of young adult patients with the 2019-nCoV. However, this is not a reason to not take this new threat seriously. Although the mortality caused by the 2019-nCoV is seemingly lower than that of SARS, its incubation period may be longer, producing a much larger number of potential asymptomatic carriers.

Our study cohort included only patients who were already critically ill. As there is currently no effective drug against the 2019-nCoV, symptomatic treatment and respiratory support were provided. Since the large-dose glucocorticoids used in the treatment of SARS resulted in serious adverse reactions [18, 19] but did not effectively decrease the mortality rate of CoV infection, [20] [21] [22] we treated patients with low-dose (30-80 mg/day) and short-term (3-5 days) methylpredisolone to alleviate the pulmonary exudates and inhibit a systemic cytokine storm. Unfortunately, this treatment did not provide significant benefits. As an alternative, intravenous injection with g-immunoglobulin can be offered; however, more clinical data are required to determine the efficacy of this treatment. In the middle and late stages of the disease, patients often develop additional bacterial or even fungal infections; therefore, careful attention must be paid to the rational use of antibiotics. In addition to the aforementioned treatments, respiratory support should be provided as early as possible. In this cohort, different types of oxygen therapy were administered according to each patient's pulse oximetry oxygen saturation and oxygenation index. For most patients, early non-invasive ventilation could promote positive outcomes. Alternatively, for critically ill patients, invasive ventilation or even ECMO should be considered. To date, ECMO has been successfully used to resuscitate one critically ill patient infected with this new CoV. Several drugs have already been tested against the 2019-nCoV and relevant clinical observation studies have been initiated with encouraging preliminary results. In particular, research on anti-coronaviral drugs and vaccines should be a continuous priority. None of these currently tested treatments was used in our cohort of patients, and thus their efficacy remains unknown.",

We did not collect and analyze data from outpatients with mild symptoms or from suspected patients under home observation and awaiting a definitive diagnosis. This may result in some bias in our general understanding of the disease. In addition, since most of the patients in this study were admitted to the respiratory departments of some tertiary hospitals in Hubei province, data from the intensive care units and other departments are insufficient, which can similarly lead to a biased understanding of the disease. On this basis, a broader and larger study is necessary in the immediate future.",

Therefore, continuous monitoring and tracing is required to secure an in-depth understanding of the disease, thereby providing an improved evidentiary basis for standardizing the diagnosis and treatment of 2019-nCoV.",
