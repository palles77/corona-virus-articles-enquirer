The study showed that oral IFNa treatment had a significant effect in reducing HIVrelated signs and infections. Both Groups 2 and 3 had a significantly greater resolution of pre-existing HIVrelated skin infections than the placebo treated Group 1. Group 3 had a greatly reduced incidence of new, mucocutaneous HSV infections (2%) compared to the placebo treated Group 1 (25%), with Group 2 having an intermediate value (13%). Interestingly, patients in the alternate IFN-a/placebo Group 2 (but not the continuous IFN-a Group 3) showed a reduction in global symptom score and small, but significant, increases in absolute and mean CD4+ counts compared with placebo treated Group 1.",

These negative observations may relate to the limited period of oral IFN-a treatment employed in these studies or to the use of recombinant as opposed to natural IFN-a.

This apparent loss of sensitivity to IFN-a therapy (or deterioration of clinical status) can be reversed by slightly increasing the dose of IFN-c~ [Babiuch and Mian, 1994] . These observations may represent clinical manifestations of a phenomenon described in vitro by Yamamoto and colleagues [Yamamoto et al., 1993] . These investigators examined the effects of IFN-a using long-term culture of HIV-1-infected white blood cells. They observed a transient loss of sensitivity of the white blood cells to IFN-a. The transient loss was observed twice during a 60 day culture period. Further studies will be needed to determine if HIV-1 resistance observed in vivo and in vitro occur by the same mechanism.",

They also raise the possibility that these effects may have biological relevance for the treatment of human disease. Moreover, they may indicate that the nasal/oral region is a window on the environment. It is most important, however, to assure that these experiments are performed with special care to avoid presenting preliminary data that is not properly controlled. It is essential to carry out these studies with sufficient animals or patients to ascertain their significance; and to plan the studies as double-blind evaluations to avoid misinterpretations when subjective tests are used.
