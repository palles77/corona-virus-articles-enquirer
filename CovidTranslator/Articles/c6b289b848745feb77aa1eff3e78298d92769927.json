The effi cacy was determined by observing the improvements of right ventricular dysfunctions (RVDs) on echocardiograms, lung perfusion defects on ventilation perfusion lung scans, and pulmonary artery obstructions on CT angiograms. The adverse events, including death, bleeding, and PTE recurrence, were also evaluated. Results: Progressive improvements in RVDs, lung perfusion defects, and pulmonary artery obstructions were found to be similarly signifi cant in both treatment groups. This is true for patients with either hemodynamic instability or massive pulmonary artery obstruction. Three (6%) patients in the rt-PA 100 mg/2 h group and one (2%) in the rt-PA 50 mg/2 h group died as the result of either PTE or bleeding. Importantly, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen resulted in less bleeding tendency than the 100 mg/2 h regimen (3% vs 10%), especially in patients with a body weight , 65 kg (14.8% vs 41.2%, P 5 .049). No fatal recurrent PTE was found in either group. Conclusions: Compared with the 100 mg/2 h regimen, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen exhibits similar effi cacy and perhaps better safety in patients with acute PTE. These fi ndings support the notion that optimizing rt-PA dosing is worthwhile when treating patients with PTE. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov; Identifi er: NCT00781378",

We used rt-PA (alteplase) from Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma (Shanghai, Republic of China) . The activated partial thromboplastin time was determined after the rt-PA infusion. If the value was , 80 s, a subcutaneous injection of low-molecular-weight heparin (nadroparin, 86 antifactor Xa International Units/kg) was given every 12 h. Overlapping oral anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) was started on day 1 to 3 after nadroparin injection to maintain an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. Nadroparin was stopped 4 to 5 days after warfarin was added, and Drug Administration and has been recommended in recent guidelines as the standard for PTE thrombolysis. 3, 4 Although this dose is effective, increasing evidence suggests that it has a high rate of bleeding complications. [5] [6] [7] Thus, there is uncertainty regarding whether the rt-PA 100 mg/2 h regimen is effective for all patients and if it is the optimal rt-PA dosage for PTE thrombolytic therapy. 7, 8 Lower dosages of rt-PA, such as a 50 mg/2 h regimen, have been used effectively for treating acute myocardial infarction. 9 With potentially fewer bleeding complications, rt-PA at 50 mg/2 h may be a better regimen for PTE treatment as well. However, no direct comparison of rt-PA at 50 mg/2 h and rt-PA at 100 mg/2 h regimens has been conducted in patients with PTE. It is unclear whether the rt-PA at 50 mg/2 h regimen is indeed a better dosage for PTE.",

However, additional analysis on patients with body weights greater than 100 kg or BMIs greater than 30 kg/m 2 was not conducted in our study because of the small sample size.

            "text": "There are a few limitations in our study. First, the small sample size, a common limitation for PTE thrombolytic studies, prevented us from achieving more powerful effi cacy and safety analyses. This is particularly true for the effi cacy analysis in patients with hemodynamic instability and in patients with higher body weight, as well as for the mortality and PTE recurrence evaluations in all patients. Future studies with larger sample sizes are desirable to examine the effi cacy and safety of the 50 mg regimen in these patient populations. Second, although physicians evaluating the imaging studies were blinded to the treatment assignments, physicians treating patients were not. This open-label study may potentially introduce bias to a certain degree. Last, a control group using heparin alone was not included for patients with extensive pulmonary artery obstruction and right ventricular dysfunction. Future studies using anticoagulation control will be valuable to determine whether thrombolytic therapy is indeed benefi cial in these patients. difference was not statistically signifi cant, previous studies demonstrated that the prevalence of ICH was relatively higher in patients receiving 100 mg rt-PA. 2, 26, 34 In our study, we observed that the overall bleeding rate was signifi cantly lower in the 50 mg rt-PA group than that in the 100 mg ft-PA group. This difference was even more obvious in patients with a body weight , 65 kg or BMI , 24 kg/m 2 . A similar trend was also found in major bleeding. The rate of major bleeding in our study (3%-10%) is comparable to previously reported trials. 5, 26, 27, 34, 35 Our fi ndings suggest that an rt-PA dose of 50 mg may be safer, especially in patients with lower body weights. We recommend that this dose can be safely used for patients with body weight , 65 kg. Further studies with larger patient populations would be useful to validate these fi ndings.",

Although the death rates and PTE recurrence rates were similar between the two treatments, the 50 mg/2 h rt-PA regimen had less bleeding tendency, especially in patients with lower body weights. Thus, compared with the rt-PA at 100 mg/2 h regimen, the rt-PA at 50 mg/2 h regimen is as effective and perhaps safer in treating lower-body-weight patients with PTE. These fi ndings support the notion that optimizing rt-PA dosing is valuable when treating patients with acute PTE.",
