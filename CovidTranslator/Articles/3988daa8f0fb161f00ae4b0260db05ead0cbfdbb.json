As shown in Fig. 1a ,c, MAb 5D-8.1 gave defined spots for the VP1 sequence of CV-B1, CV-B4, E-30, and reduced reactivity with CV-A1. The peptide scan indicated IPALTAVETGHT as the consensus sequence containing the epitope of MAb 5D-8.1. Comparable signals were produced by MAb 9D5 (Fig. 1b,d) and attributed to the consensus motif SIGNAYSMFYDG. Thus, relative to the VP1 sequence of CV-B4 (GI: 61031) 29 , the sequence containing the epitope of 5D-8.1 was close to the N-terminus at AA residues 28-39, whereas that of 5D9 was located towards the C-terminus at residues 187-198. Substitution scan of peptide IPALTAVETGHT against MAb 5D-8.1 allowed to delimit the antibody binding site to a conserved core motif 4-IPALTAAET-12. AA positions 4I, 7L and 8T showed the highest degree of sequence conservation with a nearly complete loss in binding of MAb 5D-8.1 upon exchange by other amino acids. AA positions 5P and 11E were well-conserved, exchange by Q and by H, respectively, caused a 60-80% loss in antibody binding. Compared to this, AA positions 6A and 10A exhibited a slightly higher susceptibility for substitution by selected amino acids with a maximal decrease of 50% of spot intensities. 9A and 12T showed the highest tolerance for exchange by other amino acids. Replacement by F (9A) and A (12T) was accepted without loss in antibody binding.",

For each viral capsid organization level, the Solvent-Accessible Surface Area (SASA) was calculated in order to estimate the degree-of-burial of antibody epitopes within the protein. The resolved structures of six reference enterovirus strains were obtained from the RCSB database and a 1.4 \u00c5 sphere probe was used to represent a water molecule. The exposed surface area was first calculated, and then normalized with the maximum allowed solvent-accessible area 30 . Normalized SASA values take the form of Relative Solvent Accessibility (RSA), a quantity which varies between 0 (for completely buried residues) and 100 (for maximally exposed residues). Results are summarized in Fig. 2 . The alignment of the VP1 regions recognized by the two MAbs is shown in Fig. 3a . The target residues are mainly accessible in the monomeric form for the two epitopes (N-terminal 5D-8.1, yellow; C-terminal 9D5, green). The exposed residues are highly conserved among different EV types, evidencing their importance in the capsid assembly process. Localization of the VP1 protein within the capsomere (Fig. 3b) shows that the 5D-8.1 epitope is located in a domain where exposed residues are stabilized by a beta sheet structure. Figure 3c shows the two epitopes in the VP1 protein assembled into the capsid.",

Interestingly, MAb 5D-8.1 produced significant alignments for creatine kinase U-type and a mitochondrial ATP synthase, among other proteins. These targets may represent the antigens indicated as cross-reactive by Korsgren and collaborators in 2013 27 . Similarly, MAb 9D5 may be expected to bind to a variety of human proteins, including the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 66.

Binding results and bioinformatics analyses confirmed that the epitopes of 5D-8.1 and 9D5 are distinct and located at the N-and C-terminal domains of VP1. Both antibodies are directed to conserved domains of a capsid protein of picornaviruses, and recognize the majority of EV types. However, they are not neutralizing, as expected for antibodies targeting conserved regions of the viral shell. Our data delineate the spectrum of EV types that each antibody binds to, thus confirming partial published results on the specificity of the two MAbs 18, 20, 24, 26 . Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the two antibodies cover EV types of the A species less well than those of the B, C, D species (Table 2 ). Since the binding spectra are not identical, the combined use of MAbs 5D-8.1 and 9D5 should allow to cover almost all EV types. Notably, both antibodies are also predicted to cover Rabovirus and Sapeloviruses, animal viruses of the most recent genera within the Picornaviridae family. Immunofluorescence results confirmed that MAb 5D-8.1 (but not 9D5) may produce fine granular fluorescence in the cytoplasm of uninfected human and monkey cells. This, however, occurred only at elevated antibody concentrations (i.e., > 1 \u03bcg/ml). The observation is in line with the lack of absolute specificity of EVs reported by Korsgren and collaborators 27 . We could however confirm that, when adequately diluted, the antibody produces specific staining of different EV types in cultured cells 25 without fluorescent signals in uninfected cells. Of interest to diabetes research, the linear epitopes of both MAbs bear only marginal similarity with the human proteome, with a few possible exceptions. In particular, the 5D-8.1 epitope bears similarity with creatine kinase U-type (E value, 3.0), ATP synthase mitochondrial F1 complex assembly factor (E value, 12), creatine kinase B-type (E value, 66).",

Immunofluorescent staining of cultured cells cannot be compared directly with that of immunocytochemistry. In formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, antigen retrieval is mandatory for VP1 detection 25 (suggesting that protein denaturation may favor antibody binding). In contrast, staining of cultured cells with either of these MAbs gives excellent results upon acetone or paraformaldehyde fixation (i.e., procedures not causing protein unfolding). Whether the two MAbs can bind to VP1 in its native configuration 35 within live virus particles is currently under investigation. Finally, in persistently-infected cells, expression of VP1 was frequently seen in proliferating cells with both 5D-8.1 and 9D5. The finding may not be accidental. In fact, the cellular factor 68-kDa Src-associated protein in mitosis (Sam68) has been recently shown to interact with the EV IRES during infection, thus enhancing translation of virus proteins 36 . This aspect merits further attention due to its possible impact on EV pathogenesis 36 In conclusion, both MAbs bind to the VP1 capsid protein of EVs and of phylogenetically-related picornaviruses. Epitopes are located in distinct stretches of the VP1 protein. The MAbs recognize both acute and persistent infection in cultured cells, and are devoid of EV-neutralizing activity. Thus, these distinct and independent probes will be useful for confirming histopathologic and virology data that indicate EV infection of islet cells as having a pathogenic role in diabetes. Further virus searches in diabetes and other endocrine diseases are expected. were elongated by neutral GSGSGSG linkers to avoid truncated peptides. Elongated sequences were linked to a single artificial sequence. The elongated artificial sequence was translated into 15 AA peptides with a peptide-peptide overlap of 14 amino acids and bound to duplicate spots of silica microarrays. The resulting microarrays covered peptides of all four sequences (1,181 different peptides in duplicate). For control, microarrays were framed by HA (YPYDVPDYAG) and FLAG (DYKDDDDKGG) peptides (104 spots). Rockland blocking buffer MB-070 (VWR International Frankfurt, DE), PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, PBS-Tween plus 10% Rockland blocking buffer were used for blocking, washing, and incubation procedures, respectively. Mouse mAb 5D-8.1 (IgG2a; Dako, Cernusco sul Naviglio, Italy) and 9D5 (IgG3; Millipore, Livingstone, UK) were incubated at 10 \u03bcg/ml in the microarray for 16 h at 4 \u00b0C with shaking. Goat anti-mouse IgG-DyLight680 (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, DE) served as secondary antibody and was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. HA and FLAG control peptides framing the microarray were subsequently stained with MAb anti-HA-DyLight680 (red) and MAb anti-FLAG-DyLight800 (green). Light emission was read with a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (resolution 21 \u03bcm; 700 nm; LI-COR Biosciences, Bad Homburg, DE).

Peptide array synthesis and binding detection were performed by PEPperPRINT GmbH (PEPperPRINT, Heidelberg, Germany) as reported 38, 39 .

In the permutation scan, the effect on binding of replacing each of the 15 peptide positions by standard L-amino-acids was analyzed. Each microarray contained 286 peptides printed in duplicate and was framed by HA and FLAG control peptides. One peptide microarray copy was pre-stained with the secondary goat anti-mouse IgG (H+ L) DyLight680 antibody (red) in the presence of the monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5)-DyLight800 antibody (green) followed by read-out at scanning intensities of 7/7 (red/green). Incubation of a second peptide microarray with MAb 5D-8.1 (1 \u03bcg/ml) was followed by staining with the secondary antibody in the presence of the monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5)-DyLight800 control antibody and then read-out at scanning intensities of 7/7 (red/green). Finally, the FLAG control peptides framing the peptide arrays were stained as additional internal quality control to confirm the assay quality and the peptide microarray integrity (scanning intensities red/green: 7/7).",

Based on averaged median foreground intensities, an intensity map was generated and interactions in the peptide map were highlighted by an intensity color code with red for high and white for low spot intensities. To provide an in-depth view on the substitution scan, a heat map of the peptide microarray was generated as well as a substitution matrix and an AA plot reflecting the AA preferences at a given position. Data sets were correlated with peptide and intensity maps to analyze the substitution pattern in consideration of conserved/variable amino acids and possible AA exchanges.",

The AA plot was calculated by dividing the spot intensity of a given peptide (1-YPYDVQDYA-9) by the spot intensity of the wild type epitope (1-YPYDVQDYA-9).

For each monomer structure, the complete capsid was assembled based on its BIOMT REMARK included in the PDB file. The Visual Molecular Dynamics software (VMD) 43 has been used for visualization, computation and analysis of structural data. The Solvent-Accessible Surface area (SASA) was calculated for the VP1 monomer, the capsomer, the capsid. For each epitope, BLASTp queries were performed in public databases (Homo sapiens, Viruses, Picornavirales, ssRNA viruses, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses). A BLAST program employing the SEG algorithm 44 was used to filter low complexity regions from proteins before executing a database search. The BLASTp results that produced significant alignments of the two MAb epitopes with human proteins or viral agents are reported along with the Expected(E) value. E value is used as a measure of epitope specificity. The lower the E-value, or the closer it is to zero, the more \"significant\" the match is. Analysis of the predicted reactivity of the two MAbs with the different EV types is based on the alignments of epitope sequences with the VP1 sequence of EVs. A cut off value of 70% AA identity has been used.",
