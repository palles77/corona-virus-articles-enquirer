Twitter data are known for their irregular usages of languages and informal short texts due to the 140 character limit, and for their noisiness such that majority of the posts are irrelevant to any particular health surveillance. These factors pose challenges in identifying personal health experience tweets from the Twitter data. In this study, we designed deep neural networks with 3 different architectural configurations, and after training them with a corpus of 8,770 annotated tweets, we used them to predict personal experience tweets from a set of 821 annotate tweets. Our results demonstrated a significant amount of improvement in predicting personal health experience tweets by deep neural networks over that by conventional classifiers: 37.5% in accuracy, 31.1% in precision, and 53.6% in recall. We believe that our method can be utilized in various health surveillance studies using Twitter as a data source.",

Furthermore, emotional expressions in the forms of emoticons and emoji's are commonly seen in the Twitter posts.

While their prediction performance on the training data looked strong, but in each iteration, the predictions on the unannotated data did not perform well as on the training data. This is because that authors wanted to reduce the annotation cost by only annotating the predicted positive tweets from which only the prediction precision could be measured, and it ranged from 0.28 to 0.49.",

Summarized in Table II are the significant performance improvements of predicting PETs with DNN classifiers over that with the best conventional classifier (J48). These significant improvements in performance can help with health surveillance tasks. The improved accuracy will help predict both true positive tweets (PETs) and true negative tweets (non-PETs) more accurately. The higher precision of predicting positive tweets (PETs) will help include more positive tweets (PETs) in the result, effectively reducing the number of irrelevant, noisy tweets and the annotation effort.
