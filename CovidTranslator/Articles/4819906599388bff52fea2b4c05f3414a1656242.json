            "text": "The theoretical biologist Robert Rosen developed a highly original approach for investigating the question \"What is life?\", the most fundamental problem of biology. Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem surprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical models. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect underlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships between the elements of a biological system, according to the motto \"throw away the physics, keep the organisation\". Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic models that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might have deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own work. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M, R) systems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach could be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a particular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions rather than a fundamentally different approach that excludes mechanistic models. The strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison with current network biology literature. Finally, it is argued that Rosen's definition of life, \"organisms are closed to efficient causation\", should be considered as a hypothesis to be tested and ideas how this postulate could be implemented in mathematical models are presented.",

There was an obviously highly original idea for investigating a question which is so hard to answer that it is, in fact, rarely asked: What is life? Also the methods that Rosen used for his work, borrowed from the highly abstract theory of categories, do not quite fit in the classical arsenal of the applied mathematician's toolbox. Could category theory, an area of mathematics so abstract that, in fact, even some of its pioneers referred to it as \"abstract nonsense\" be successfully applied to a fundamental real-world question \"What is life?\" which at the same time happens to be one of the hardest scientific questions that one may possibly ask? 1 That sounded interesting, very interesting, indeed!

            "text": "I will present my answers to these questions as my personal perspective on Robert Rosen's work. The purpose of this is twofold: First, in my opinion, Rosen's highly original work deserves 1 Rosen's work on (M, R) systems is by no means the only application of category theory to the sciences. Best-known are perhaps applications in computer sciencetwo examples for textbooks are Pierce (1991) and Barr and Wells (2012) -as well as mathematical physics (Coecke, 2011) . A recent introduction to category theory with a view towards applications in the sciences by Spivak (2014) underlines the fact that the trend of category-theoretic ideas in science is increasing. But Rosen's work is one of the earliest, if not the earliest application of category theory outside mathematics. more attention from the mainstream of mathematical biologists. Second, I believe that Rosen's frustration that his ideas were not more widely and openly accepted (Mikulecky, 2001) is not completely coincidental-there are important differences between Rosen's theoretical concept of a model and the understanding of modelling within the applied mathematics community. These differences are on the one hand philosophical-Rosen demands that a model accurately represents the causal relationships between the elements of the system to be modelled (see Section 4) whereas models typically built by applied mathematicians can be regarded as formal representations of a hypothesis regarding a possible mechanism underlying the system behaviour (see Section 5). On the other hand, Rosen applies mathematical notions, in particular, category theory, in a different spirit than most applied mathematicians would. This issue-which is related to Rosen's presentation of his ideas rather than the ideas themselves-is more important than it may look at a first glance because this difference in using mathematical tools may deter an audience with a mathematical background from Rosen's ideas (Section 6.2.1). My presentation is based on the original publications Rosen (1958a Rosen ( ,b, 1959 Rosen ( , 1971 Rosen ( , 1973 Rosen ( , 1991 and Rosen (2000) but I will most often refer to Rosen (1972) because this, in my opinion, is the best summary of Rosen's early publications and to his monograph \"Life Itself\" (Rosen, 1991) which is the most comprehensive account of the philosophical basis of Rosen's work. Another good introduction into Rosen's thinking are his \"Autobiographical Reminiscences\" (Rosen, 2006) .",

            "text": "Instead of a descriptive definition, Rosen proposes a relational approach for distinguishing systems that are \"dead\" from systems that are \"alive\". He starts from a set of components that he explicitly refers to as black boxes i.e. he avoids making any assumptions on the internal structure of these components. Instead his focus is on the relationships between these components-he develops a highly abstract theory with the purpose of demonstrating that the way that components interact determines if a system is \"complex\" or \"simple\" and also, if a system is \"alive\" or \"not alive\". By developing an approach that intentionally ignores the properties of individual components of a system and emphasising the relationships between these components he followed a motto of his mentor Nicolai Rashevsky (cited according to Rosen (2006) )-\"Throw away the physics, keep the organisation\". More generally, the question of the relationship between structure (i.e., for example, the underlying physics) and function in biology has a long history. For example, the famous Cuvier-Geoffroy debate in front of the French Academy of Sciences in 1830 was ultimately about the two principles \"form follows function\" which was Georges Cuvier's view whereas Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire argued for the opposite position \"structure determines function\". In Rosen (1991) , his monograph \"Life itself\", he strongly rejects \"structure determines function\" which is currently, for example, influential in molecular biology in the theory of protein foldingbecause the sequence of amino acids (primary structure) to a great extent controls the three-dimensional arrangement (tertiary structure) and this 3D structure determines the function of a protein it is argued that structure determines function (Petsko and Ringe, 2008) .",

            "text": "In contrast, Rosen states that biological functions arise from the interactions between the parts of a biological system, independent of the material realisation of the components. In order to explain this idea, let us consider calcium signalling. In many cases when hormonal or electrical signals reach a cell, calcium oscillations are used for propagating these signals within the cell and control a wide range of cellular functions such as the contraction of heart cells or the transcription of particular genes. The shape of these oscillations can be very different between cell types although the Ca 2+ signalling components involved are the same-voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, that allow calcium influx in response to electrical signals, intracellular channels like the inositol-trisphosphate or the ryanodyne receptor, that release large amounts of calcium from intracellular stores when stimulated, and Ca 2+ pumps, that return Ca 2+ released to the cytosol back to intracellular stores. How can Ca 2+ oscillations be so different in different cell types if they are generated by similar sets of Ca 2+ signalling components? An obvious explanation is that Ca 2+ oscillations in particular cell types are shaped by relationships between the components that are characteristic of this cell type. This is the concept of the Ca 2+ \"toolbox\" which is the basis of our current understanding of Ca 2+ oscillations (Berridge et al., 2000) . But does the fact that differences in the relationships between components are important for explaining the different shape of Ca 2+ oscillations imply that we should restrict ourselves to investigating relationships and completely ignore structural properties of the components? We will come back to this question in more general terms in the Discussion.",

The efficient cause is most closely related to the modern notion of causality. In the context of (M, R) systems each of the components are the efficient causes of the transformation of elements in the domain to elements in the range, for example, in (1), f is the efficient cause for transforming A to f(A) & B. For the same example, A provides the material cause for the transformation of A to f(A). 8 We only ",

Rosen's construction of the b b has 2 An adaptation of Rosen's terminology to biochemistry may be found in Letelier et al. (2006) . Here, we keep the original terminology. 3 The nature of this \"disappearance\" is not made explicit in Rosen's writings. He only states that disappearance of a component has the effect that the production of output material B stops. 4 By using this notation, Rosen would like to imply that the maps appearing in H (A, B) are \"(homo)morphisms\", maps that preserve mathematical structure associated with A and B rather than general maps-see Section 4 for an explanation of the category-theoretic notion of morphism via an example. But because Rosen avoids assigning a specific mathematical structure to the sets A and B this has no consequences for his model, in particular, the maps H(A, B) cannot model, for example, biochemical properties of metabolism. Moreover, in many circumstances the morphisms H(A, B) are still just a set even if A and B have a particular mathematical structure. 5 By introducing F f , strictly speaking, the set O fails to be an environmental output because it is now contained in the domain of F f . 6 In Rosen's own biochemical interpretation of the components f as enzymes and F as genetic components, (M, R) systems can be related to the production of enzymes via gene transcription which itself depends on the activity of enzymes. But the abstract construction of (M, R) systems are general enough that the approach can be applied to different domains. 7 Applications of Aristotle's classification of four causes have some tradition in biology, confer Tinbergen's levels of analysis, first presented in Tinbergen (1963) . 8 Rosen also discusses the formal cause and the final cause. Although all four causes are important for Rosen's theory, the remaining two Aristotelean causes are not directly relevant to our discussion. Therefore we refer the reader to Rosen (1991) . 9 This is, in fact, not as strong a restriction as it may seem-by combining sets via Cartesian products '\u00c2' and defining maps on the products in an obvious way, several (M, R) systems with more than three components can be cast in the form (3).",

Instead, I propose to consider the existence of the replication map simply as a postulate regarding the structure of living systems, summarised in the statement \"organisms are closed to efficient causation\". More interesting than the details of the mathematical investigation is Rosen's interpretation of (M, R) systems whose elements interact in a way that mutually ensures replacement of failing components. (M, R) systems with this property provide Rosen's model for organisms which he characterises as \"organisms are closed to efficient causation\". In order to explain this concept, Rosen (1991, chapter 10) presents a diagram that illustrates this statement ( ) (by a mapping to B) but also shows \"causal\" relationships-indicated by broken arrows-where components initiate a transformation by acting on elements in one of these sets. By following a broken and then a solid arrow we see that the production of each component is \"caused\" by another component in the system-in Rosen's own words, f \"entails\" b b , b b \"entails\" F f and F f \"entails\" f. Thus, the system contains a closed loop of efficient causation f ! b b ! F f ! f, a property that Rosen denotes closure to efficient causation.",

Examples include the parabola, y \u00c0 x 2 = 0 or the unit circle, x 2 + y 2 = 1. Geometrically, the curve is the set of pairs (a, b) that fulfil the equation f(x, y) = 0; the (a, b) are elements of a two-dimensional vector space R 2 . One of the most important aspects of modern algebraic geometry is not to be very specific about R, the interest is in general properties of algebraic sets defined by systems of polynomial equations. Whereas classical algebraic geometry investigates polynomial equations over the complex numbers C, we may instead consider the real numbers R, the rationals Q or a finite field with q elements F q . 12 Even more generally, we may choose an algebra R over a field K. A K-algebra is a vector space over a field K whose elements can in addition be multiplied, unlike in a general vector space which only requires addition of elements. Because, trivially, a field can be regarded as a whereas f, F f and b b are \"efficient causes\". Because each of the components is in turn produced by one of the other components the system is closed to efficient causation. 10 The following introduction to category theory is intentionally informal-the point is to introduce the spirit of category theory rather than enabling the reader to start their own career as a category theorist. See the Introduction of the classical monograph by Mac Lane (1971) for a very readable exposition for the mathematically inclined reader. 11 This is, in fact, the first example of category theory that I saw as a student. I thank Prof. Heinz Spindler (University of Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany) for his beautiful lectures on algebraic geometry that gave me a lot of pleasure. 12 A field K is an algebraic structure where addition and multiplication of elements are associative, commutative and distributive and additive and multiplicative inverses exist.

In general, causal entailment refers to the relations between objects defined by the morphisms of a category which is quite abstract. But for the specific example of algebraic curves it is quite clear what this means. From a mathematical point of view, studying a general algebraic curve over a general K-algebra R is impossible without further assumptions on the K-algebra R because sets do not have a lot of structure. In contrast, for Kalgebras, arithmetical operations such as addition and multiplication are defined and mathematical theorems have been proven that give insight into how the elements behave under these operations. Thus, whereas the structure of K-algebras may be investigated with a variety of tools from commutative algebra, much less insight can be gained by simply considering the sets C\u00f0R\u00de of algebraic curves over R. But the functor C enables us to switch between the \"natural system\" (sets) and the \"formal system\" (Kalgebras) so that we can explore geometric facts using algebra.

Rosen defined a simulation as a relationship that considers the natural system as a \"black box\" without attempting (or being able) to capture the \"causal entailment\" within the natural system. An example of simulation for our example is the numerical approximation of algebraic curves. Numerical methods may succeed in obtaining an approximation of an algebraic curve without any consideration of the underlying algebraic structure by iteratively approximating points of the curve from a starting value (x 0 , y 0 ) known to lie on the curve (Gomes et al., 2009 ). With Rosen we might say that these numerical methods are able to \"predict\" the \"natural system\" i.e. the algebraic curve. But it is clear that this is not based on bringing the entailment structure of a formal system in congruence with the entailment structures of the natural system to be modelled. This, however, is according to Rosen the ideal that a model should live 13 Due to set-theoretic paradoxes, we can, in fact, not consider categories of \"all\" Kalgebras or \"all\" sets. 14 A (commutative) ring is an algebraic structure similar to a field. The difference is that multiplicative inverses are not required to exist for all elements. Note that in addition to the ring structure the coordinate ring also has the structure of a Kalgebra. 15 [x], [y] are equivalence classes and can be considered as those polynomials with \"remainder\" x or y, respectively, when \"dividing\" by f-the coordinate ring is an example of a quotient ring. We will not go into more detail because it does not add much to the discussion and refer the interested reader to any introduction to algebra. up to. 16 As I will explain in the Discussion, it is exactly this ambition that, in my opinion, separates Rosen's understanding of modelling most strongly from an applied mathematician's view on modelling which is illustrated in the next section.",

What not everyone knows is that models (at least the good ones (Ellner and Guckenheimer, 2007) ) are based on false assumptions. As illustrations we can take nearly all mathematical models from physics. One of the most striking example is the apparently harmless notion of a mass point. Moving bodies such as cars, space ships or parachutists are described by particles without spatial extension whose mass is concentrated in a single point. In this way our model describes objects that may weigh several tonnes or more while at the same time they \"are not even there\" because it is assumed to have no spatial extension! The only reason that we find such an idea not completely outrageous is by the justification we get for this model after we have applied it to a natural system. We \"get away\" with this obviously wrong assumption, we can, for example, predict the trajectories of celestial bodies to a certain accuracy. Also, more detailed models of rigid body motion and the notion of the centre of mass give additional support for this model and insight why representing bodies as mass points worked in the first place. The most important point here is, though, that before this model was applied to a concrete problem, it was not at all clear that it would turn out to provide a useful description of a physical object. The justification of \"lies\" in modelling can only be given in hindsight.",

It is not easy to provide an example for \"cheating\" because obviously scientists will usually not describe anything they did in a study as cheating. Because I would not like to accuse colleagues of cheating either I have no choice but to give an example of \"cheating\" from my own work. A few years ago I was working on a model for an ion channel (Siekmann et al., 2012) . My motivation was to take into account model gating, a feature that is quite common in ion channel dynamics but which has rarely been accounted for in models. Instead of continuously adjusting their activity many ion channels switch spontaneously between highly different types of behaviour (modes). I wanted to demonstrate that across all experimental conditions each of the different modes defined the same type of behaviour i.e. could be described by statistically similar models. Unfortunately, for some experimental conditions I was not able to fit a model to the segments representative for the modes because the channel was switching too fast and therefore the segments were too short in order to produce statistically conclusive results. But although I thus was not able to rigorously prove my claim I nevertheless argued that the hypothesis of modes which are unchanged across all experimental conditions was-with some positive and in the absence of contrary evidence-presumably correct.",

Volterra (1926) simply reinterpreted the law of mass action kinetics where the rate of a chemical reaction is assumed proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two reactants as the catch rate of a predator feeding on a prey. The reason that terms characteristic of chemical models were often \"stolen\" by ecologists and epidemiologists is because the law of mass action and enzyme kinetics can, from a more abstract point of view, be interpreted as contact rates between two populations (Siekmann, 2009) .",

The imitation game (also known as the Turing test) was proposed by Turing (1950) in order to answer the question \"Can machines think?\". In order to pass the test the machine must communicate in natural language with a human evaluator and through this conversation convince the evaluator that it is human. This is a perfect example for simulation because by definition of the test it is unimportant if and to which extent the machine attempts to accurately represent human intelligence. In contrast, Turing (1952) proposes a mathematical model that exhibits inhomogeneous stationary distributions (Turing instability) . This leads to a model that explains morphogenesis in terms of two interacting chemical species (an \"activator\" and an \"inhibitor\") that diffuse with different speeds. This is achieved by defining a formal system that transparently captures how the elements of the system interact with each other and how these interactions are parameterised with experimental data. A mechanistic model is also strongly determined by a purpose which means that already the architecture and not just the interpretation of the model results is defined by the question that the model should answer. Building a mechanistic model starts with the formulation of a set of assumptions that summarise what is known about a system, extended by some hypotheses regarding details of the natural system that are currently unknown. Which aspects of our knowledge are represented in how much detail depends on the model purpose. Based on the underlying assumptions a model structure is constructed that is meant to represent the assumptions as well as possible. This model can then be simulated in order to produce results. The results obtained from the model are then interpreted in comparison with the natural system and in the light of the assumptions made in the beginning which leads to conclusions that are drawn from the modelling study.",

            "text": "To give an example, I will refer to recent work in mathematical ecology that I contributed to. A series of papers, starting with Bengfort et al. (2016a) and Siekmann and Malchow (2016) , primarily had two purposes. The aim of Bengfort et al. (2016a) was to investigate alternatives to the classical model of population dispersal based on the common model for diffusion due to Fick (Fick, 1855) . Siekmann and Malchow (2016) considered alternatives to the classical model for environmental fluctuations based on stochastic terms that scale linearly in the population densities. Bengfort et al. (2016b) studied the combined effect of Fokker-Planck diffusion (Fokker, 1914; Planck, 1917) , an alternative to Fickian diffusion, and linear noise terms whereas Siekmann et al. (2017) combine Fokker-Planck diffusion with a nonlinear noise term proposed in Siekmann and Malchow (2016) . Consistent with the model purpose, the authors primarily consider a very simple model for the interactions of populations, the Lotka-Volterra competition model. Also, a special parameter set is considered where in the deterministic, non-spatial version of the model, the population with the higher initial population always outcompetes its competitor. In order to investigate spatial and stochastic effects, the parameter of the diffusion model and the noise model are varied. The models demonstrate that stochastic fluctuations enhance the success of invading species that invade the habitat of a resident population but may also enable resident and invader to coexist which is impossible in the deterministic non-spatial version of the model. At this point it is important to note that the definition of a mechanistic model presented here by no means excludes relational models favoured by Rosen-in the terms developed here, an important underlying assumption of a relational model simply is that the internal structure of the individual system elements is not represented in detail. The most important difference to Rosen's interpretation of models is that no suggestion is made that a mechanistic model accurately captures the causal relationships of the system to be modelled-there is no modelling relationship that in a theoretical sense provides the modeller with access to the structure of the natural system. The reason for this is scepticism-a large proportion of applied mathematicians would presumably be highly pessimistic that achieving congruence between a formal system and a natural system as envisaged by Rosen was possible and even if it could be achieved that this could be verified. Thus, from the outset, the motivation of a mechanistic model is much more modest. The aim of modelling is to provide insight into an aspect of a natural system that is defined by the purpose of the model. Obtaining a complete understanding is, in principle, out of reach due to the simplifying assumptions made when the model was built. Also, mechanistic models can only provide possible explanations of phenomena observed in the natural system. If the results obtained from the model contradict the behaviour of the natural system one concludes that the underlying assumptions of the model are either incorrect or incomplete. But if the results are consistent with the system to be modelled we cannot conclude that the explanation provided by the model is correct because we cannot exclude the possibility that alternative models with completely different underlying assumptions produce similar results. Instead of regarding a mechanistic model as a mathematical representation of some \"truth\" it is therefore more accurate to think of a model as an argument for a particular hypothesis explaining the observed behaviour of a natural system.",

For example, once a large-scale biological network has been inferred from data, the question of its interpretation might not be easy to answer, precisely because only minimal assumptions are made regarding the properties of individual nodes. Is it most important that a network has certain global properties such as being scale-free (Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Barab\u00e1si and Albert, 1999) , to which extent the network can be controlled (Liu et al., 2011; Ruths and Ruths, 2014) or that certain \"network motifs\" are more prevalent than expected by chance (Milo et al., 2002; Alon, 2007) ? If we consider, more specifically, gene regulatory networks another problem becomes apparent. Rosen always assumes that relationships between the components of his (M, R) systems are known. Unfortunately, inferring the interactions within biochemical networks such as the highly complicated large networks of genes and their transcripts is often quite challenging and might not lead to conclusive results. This motivated, for example, Oates et al. (2014) to include a more detailed model of the underlying reactions in order to obtain more accurate results on the interactions between the components of the biochemical network. Also, as far as the impact of the conclusions is concerned, one might argue that combining network models with at least some description of the underlying \"physics\" of the components has been more promising than studies that are restricted to networks whose nodes without considering their underlying structure. As an example I refer to Colizza et al. (2006) who investigated the global spread of epidemics along the airline traffic network using the example of the 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

The ability for finding such mathematical analogies (between topological and algebraic objects in the case of algebraic topology) crucially depends both on relations between objects from particular categories (such as topological spaces or groups) but also on the underlying mathematical structures of these objects that are preserved by morphisms.",

From the introduction of (Rosen, 1958b) it becomes clear that Rosen regards category theory as an incremental extension of graph theory that enables him to more flexibly describe relations between \"black boxes\". Unfortunately, this prevents him from taking much advantage from the main strength of category theory, namely, relating the structure of mathematical objects appearing in different disciplines of mathematics. The negative impact of this use of category theory on an audience of applied mathematicians must not be underestimated. A strong motivation in mathematics itself as well as in the community of applied mathematicians is to use mathematical notions as efficiently as possible. By failing to take full advantage of the ability of category theory to relate mathematical structures Rosen does not only miss the chance to capture properties of a biological system that might be encoded in such structures. Even worse, an audience from a mathematical background might even be deterred from Rosen's ideas, not because of the ideas themselves but due to the perceived shortcomings in their mathematical presentation. In summary, one might go as far as saying that instead of being a strength of Rosen's theories, category theory is one of the most important obstacles for their acceptance. Nevertheless one shall not be overly critical of Rosen's approach of using category theory for his research-after all he was a pioneer in applying a novel, quite difficult mathematical discipline at a time when even the foundations of this discipline were still under development.",

One reviewer of an earlier version of this manuscript kindly directed me to work from the group of mathematical physicist John Baez who have most recently applied category theory to open reaction networks (Baez and Pollard, 2017) . It is worthwhile to compare this emerging research with (M, R) systems which were inspired by networks of metabolic reactions. Rather than abstracting reaction networks to a network of input-output relationships, Baez and coworkers go the opposite way-they develop specific categories RNet and RxNet in order to formalise Petri Nets, a diagrammatic representation of chemical reactions. By constructing a functor to the category Dynam of open dynamical systems they can relate a given Petri net to a system of ordinary differential equations, the rate equations associated with this particular Petri net. A functor from Dynam to the category of relations Rel maps dynamical systems to their steady states. Of course, the ambition of Baez and co-workers is presumably not to answer questions like \"What is life?\" but their \"compositional framework\" allows them to build reaction networks from simpler components via composition of morphisms and relate the structural properties of reaction networks to similar models such as electrical circuits (Baez and Fong, 2016) , signal-flow diagrams (Erbele, 2016) and Markov processes (Baez et al., 2015) which are all formalised in a similar way as described above using the language of category theory. It seems clear that although this work is not less \"relational\" than Rosen's (M, R) systems or the network science approaches mentioned in Section 6.1, the publications from Baez's group clearly take advantage of category theory for relating the different mathematical structures characteristic of different modelling approaches.",

But, first of all, according to the view explained in Section 5.4, mechanistic models should not be considered as the opposite of relational models, in fact, relational models can be regarded as a particular type of mechanistic model. Second, many of Rosen's objections arise because he implicitly assumes that mechanistic models necessarily have to be interpreted in a reductionistic way. But building a mechanistic model does not mean that the natural system necessarily must be \"reduced\" to the mechanism represented by the model-in fact, this is just a specific interpretation. In contrast, in Section 5.4 we propose an alternative perspective on mechanistic models-according to this view the \"mechanism\" represented in a mechanistic model only provides an explanation of a particular aspect of the system behaviour which is defined by the underlying assumptions of the model. If additional aspects of the system behaviour are to be considered this requires refining the assumptions of the model, as a result the new model will represent a more detailed mechanism that provides a more comprehensive (but still partial) explanation of the system behaviour.",

But according to Rosen's definition, the fact that the coordinate ring A exists as a model for arbitrary K-algebras makes algebraic curves a \"simple\" system. For a \"complex\" system, an analogue of the coordinate ring A might still exist but it is \"non-simulable\" which Rosen defines as not Turing-computable .

According to Section 5.4 and in contrast to Rosen's concept of the modelling relation a system does not \"have\" models-models cannot be objectively associated with a system via the modelling relationship but rather are subjectively attributed to the system by the modeller. A model will-due to the requirement of making simplifying assumptions-necessarily always remain incomplete, the case of a \"simple\" system in Rosennean terms, where a perfect formal representation of a natural system can be found, does not exist. Mechanistic models serve a specific purpose by efficiently representing a set of underlying assumptions that are consistent with the purpose of the model. As explained in Section 5.4, rather than being a formal representation of a particular \"truth\" about a natural system, the aim of mechanistic models is to explore scientific hypotheses that are represented in the assumptions of the model. Therefore, consideration of competing models based on alternative assumptions is an important part of scientific discussion in the literature.",

(2006); Cornish-Bowden et al. (2007) ; C\u00e1rdenas and Cornish-Bowden (2007) developed a simple (M, R) system representing a simple biochemical reaction network that was later implemented in a mathematical model and investigated by simulation (Piedrafita et al., 2010 (Piedrafita et al., , 2012a (Piedrafita et al., , 2012 Cornish-Bowden et al., 2013) . Whereas organisms are postulated to be closed to efficient causation, they must be open to \"material causes\" as explained in Section 3 or, in more familiar terms, flows of matter and energy. A mathematical model that realises Rosen's concept of an organism should therefore also appropriately account for the exchange of matter and energy with the environment. The bond graph methodology (Borutzky, 2010) is an established approach from the engineering literature for building models of complex systems with energy flows between multiple domains (electrical, chemical etc.). Bond graphs were recently applied to biochemical reactions (Gawthrop and Crampin, 2014; Gawthrop et al., 2015) and subsequently to more complex physiological systems (Gawthrop and Crampin, 2016; Gawthrop et al., 2017) . Also, in mathematical ecology there are several examples of energy-based models ranging from the early (E, M) framework developed by Smerage (1976) to the more recent studies by Cropp and Norbury (2012) and Bates et al. (2015) . Extending these frameworks by modelling approaches that realise closure to efficient causation will enable us to investigate the significance of Rosennean Complexity for ecosystems.",

            "text": "In all implementations of Rosen's principle of closure to efficient causation an obvious difficulty is to identify \"efficient causes\" and distinguish them from \"material causes\"-Rosen's own publications provide relatively little guidance due to the mostly formal presentation with very few specific biological examples. In this regard, the recent paper Mossio et al. (2016) is highly relevant: the authors develop a theory of biological organisation that comprises Rosen's views but draws from the much longer tradition of organicism. Organicism is a perspective on biology which states that \"organisms are the main object of biological science because [...] they cannot be reduced to more fundamental biological entities (such as the genes or other inert components of the organism)\" . Organicism implies that the individual parts that the organism consists of can only be understood by taking into account their relationships and interactions with other parts. But crucially, in contrast to the approach that Rosen takes with his (M, R) systems, Mossio et al. (2016) avoid reducing the parts of an organism to \"black boxes\" without underlying structure. Instead, they identify specific parts of biological systems as constraints which control processes without themselves being altered by them-they give the role that enzymes play in reaction networks and the influence of the vascular system on the flow of oxygen in the body as examples. Biological organisation according to Mossio et al. (2016) is realised via \"closure of constraints\" which shows that constraints are a closely related concept to Rosen's \"efficient causes\". This idea of biological organisation is one of three theoretical principles for biology proposed in the highly readable special issue \"From the century of the genome to the century of the organism: New theoretical approaches\" published in Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology-the others are variation and a postulated biological \"default state\" (Soto et al., 2016) . The articles from this special issue provide valuable guidance to modellers who wish to construct models which represent Rosen's idea of an organism or, indeed, stand in the much longer tradition of organicism.",

On the one hand, solid arrows show where transformations from input material to output material occur-A is transformed to B, B is, in turn used for \"repairing\" f whereas f is transformed in order to repair F f .On the other hand, for the broken arrows, a component located at the start of an arrow indicates the initiation of a transformation located at the arrow tip-f catalyses the \"metabolic\" transition of A to B, F f acts on B for repairing f and the replication map b b starts the repair of F f by transforming f. It is clear that each of the components f, F f and b b regulates the repair of another component. In Rosen's words, the sets A, B, H(A, B) and H(B,H(A, B)) can be regarded as \"material causes\"",
