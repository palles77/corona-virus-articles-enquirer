These mechanisms are usually mediated by antiviral proteins whose expression and activities can be constitutive but are frequently amplified by interferon induction. Among these interferonstimulated proteins, members of the IFITM (interferon-induced transmembrane) family are unique because they prevent infection before a virus can traverse the lipid bilayer of the cell. At least three human IFITM proteins-IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3-have antiviral activities. These activities limit infection in cultured cells by many viruses, including dengue virus, Ebola virus, influenza A virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and West Nile virus. Murine Ifitm3 controls influenza A virus infection in vivo, and polymorphisms in human IFITM3 correlate with the severity of both seasonal and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Here we review the discovery and characterization of the IFITM proteins, describe the spectrum of their antiviral activities, and discuss potential mechanisms underlying these effects.",

These mechanisms usually result in the expression of type I or type II interferons. Interferons signal through interferon receptors to recruit and activate JAKs (Janus kinases) and TYK (tyrosine-specific kinase), which in turn phosphorylate STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins. Following phosphorylation, STAT proteins translocate to the nucleus, where they associate with interferon regulatory proteins to promote expression of a wide array of genes. More than 1,000 interferon-stimulated genes have been identified. These genes can be specifically induced by either or both types of interferons and vary widely in their antipathogen activities and their constitutive and interferon-induced expression levels (1-4).",

The retrovirus field has also made a distinction between so-called intrinsic and innate immunity (3) . Intrinsic factors are those with high constitutive levels of expression and activity, whereas classical innate immune factors, such as the RNA-activated PKR (protein kinase R), RNase L, and 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligo-adenylate synthases, usually require a pathogen recognition event and induction by interferon. However, expression of intrinsic factors such as the antiretroviral factors Trim5a and tetherin can be further increased by interferons, whereas a number of interferon-stimulated genes also have high levels of basal expression. Other investigators have categorized antiviral proteins expressed in target cells as cell-intrinsic factors (2) to distinguish their functions from the multiple innate immune activities of macrophages, neutrophils, and other immune cells that specialize in responding to infection.",

Uniquely among known restriction factors, these proteins prevent viruses from traversing the lipid bilayer of the cell and accessing the cytoplasm (1). The IFITM proteins potently restrict a number of viral pathogens important to human health, such as dengue virus (DENV) and influenza A virus (IAV), but intriguingly have little or no effect on many other viruses-for example, the arenavirus that causes Lassa fever (LASV) (7) . Much has been learned since the IFITM proteins were identified as anti-IAV restriction factors in 2009, but the exact molecular mechanisms mediating their antiviral activities are not yet fully understood. Here we discuss their identification, their structures and activities, and what is known or can be guessed about their mechanisms of restriction.",

IFITM1 was found to encode the Leu-13 antigen (later designated as CD225), indicating that at least some part of IFITM1 was exposed at the plasma membrane (9) . IFITM1 is associated with components of the B cell receptor including CD19, CD21, and, most directly, CD81/TAPA-1 (10) (11) (12) . Antibodies cross-linking IFITM1 promote homotypic adhesion of leukemic B and T cells (13, 14) , inhibit the proliferation of B cell lines, and downregulate L-selectin (15) . The significance of these observations remains unclear. Moreover, the topology of IFITM proteins suggests that they are unlikely to have natural ligands that could function directly in the same manner and, therefore, that these anti-IFITM1 antibodies likely function by cross-linking IFITM1-associated proteins.",

In the murine embryo, Ifitm3 (fragilis) is specifically expressed in primordial germ cells (PGCs) but not in adjacent somatic cells and can be used as a marker of germ cell competence in mouse embryos (16, 17) . Ifitm3 confers the homing properties of PGCs to somatic cells. In contrast, Ifitm1 may mediate the transit of primordial germ cells from the mesoderm to the endoderm (18) . However, the relevance of these observations was called into question when it was shown that mice homozygous for a deletion of the Ifitm3 gene or of the entire Ifitm locus (IfitmDel \u2212/\u2212 mice) have no apparent developmental defects or indeed any overt phenotype (19) .

These investigators also observed that mouse cells overexpressing human IFITM1 were more refractory than control cells to VSV infection. Much less pronounced effects were observed with IAV. Although these results differ from more recent studies that indicate more potent restriction of IAV relative to VSV (21) , this study marked the first description of antiviral activity for an IFITM protein. Despite this report, a passing reference to activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV) by IFITM3 (22) , and abundant evidence that IFITM proteins are potently induced by type I and II interferons, it took an additional 13 years to rediscover the antiviral activities of the IFITM proteins.",

(23) , in two of five similar IAV-targeting RNA interference screens published within weeks of one another. Further work reported by Brass et al. (7) validated the initial screen by demonstrating that small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting IFITM3 strongly promoted H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) replication in U2OS cells and that IFITM3-specific siRNA could, to a large extent, overcome suppression of viral replication mediated by interferon-\u03b3. Overexpression of human IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 suppressed replication of H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) and H3N2 (A/Udorn/72) but not that of murine leukemia virus in A549, U2OS, and MDCK cell lines as well as in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from IfitmDel \u2212/\u2212 mice were markedly more susceptible to IAV infection than were MEFs from their wild-type littermates, and type I and type II interferons had a less pronounced effect on IAV replication in IfitmDel \u2212/\u2212 MEFs. Moreover, infection by retroviruses pseudotyped with various H1, H3, H5, and H7 hemagglutinin (HA) proteins, but not with the entry proteins of the Machupo virus (MACV) or murine leukemia virus (MLV), was efficiently suppressed by IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, establishing that restriction targets an HA-mediated process, presumably viral entry. The same study also showed that flaviviruses, including DENV and West Nile virus (WNV), are similarly susceptible to IFITM-mediated restriction. Collectively, these results established that IFITM proteins function in cell culture as potent restriction factors against two important families of enveloped viruses and that their activities may contribute significantly to the anti-IAV activities of type I and type II interferons.",

            "text": "The IFITM proteins belong to a larger family of dispanin proteins found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (24) . IFITM proteins are defined by the presence of a central highly conserved region, named after CD225 (IFITM1). The IFITM proteins can be further divided into three clades based on sequence similarity and putative functions (25) . Clade I includes all the human proteins shown to have antiviral activities, namely IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3-the so called immunity-related IFITMs. IFITM2 and IFITM3 are highly homologous, whereas IFITM1 diverges modestly from these two proteins. Clade I also includes murine orthologs of these proteins as well as murine Ifitm6 and Ifitm7, the latter of which is encoded by an intronless retrogene derived from the Ifitm1 gene. Most mammals appear to have orthologs of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3, as do chickens (25) (26) (27) (28) . In other species, such as rhesus macaques, it is difficult to assign the two IFITM2/3-like genes as orthologs of human IFITM2 or IFITM3. The human IFITM locus is located on chromosome 11, whereas the mouse and chicken loci are on chromosomes 7 and 5, respectively ( Figure  1 ). Murine Ifitm7, likely retrotranscribed from Ifitm1, is found on chromosome 16. With the exception of Ifitm7, all human and mouse genes encoding IFITM proteins include an intron that separates two coding exons. Most of these genes are also initiated by an additional noncoding exon.",

            "text": "Lange et al. (19) established two strains of knockout mice to explore the role of murine Ifitm proteins in primordial germ cell development. IfitmDel \u2212/\u2212 mice bear a 120-kb deletion of the entire Ifitm locus on chromosome 7, resulting in deletion of the Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm3, Ifitm5, and Ifitm6 genes (see Figure 1 ). Ifitm10 and the Ifitm7 retrogene on chromosome 16 remain intact. These mice are viable, do not display gross developmental defects, and reproduce similarly to their wild-type counterparts. Careful study of Ifitm5-knockout mice, however, revealed subtle changes in skeletal morphology during embryonic development (30) , which makes it likely that IfitmDel \u2212/\u2212 mice share this phenotype. Ifitm3 in the lungs of uninfected wild-type mice, particularly in respiratory epithelium, the visceral pleura, and endothelial cells. These tissues all form anatomic barriers between the host and the environment or between different anatomic compartments, suggesting that Ifitm3 prevents dissemination of local infection. In addition to respiratory epithelial cells, Ifitm3 is expressed in another key IAV target cell type-alveolar type II pneumocytesfollowing IAV infection (34) . Collectively, these studies make a compelling case for a critical role of Ifitm3 in the in vivo control of acute influenza. Everitt et al. (33) provided the first evidence for an in vivo role for IFITM3 in humans. Caucasians hospitalized for infection with 2009 pandemic H1N1 were noted to display a significant enrichment of a minor IFITM3 allele, SNP 12252-C. Individuals with two such alleles (rs12252-C/C) were found in 5.7% of 53 patients hospitalized with H1N1 IAV in Great Britain, whereas only 0.3% of 1,000 Europeans were homozygous for rs12252-C. SNP 12252-C has been proposed to create a novel splice acceptor site resulting in an IFITM3 variant, truncated in its first 21 amino acids, that is much less efficient at restricting IAV. Although this shorter splice variant was not identified in lymphoblastoid cell lines homozygous for rs12252-C, lower overall IFITM3 expression was observed in these cells. The rs12252-C allele is rare in Caucasians, but it is much more prevalent among Han Chinese. A study of this population showed that 69% of Chinese patients with severe H1N1/09 infection were homozygotes (35) . In contrast, rs12252-C/C homozygotes constituted only 25% of individuals with a milder infection. Similarly, in a study of individuals infected with pathogenic avian-origin H7N9, rs12252-C/C homozygotes sought medical attention, developed acute respiratory distress more quickly, and had higher mortality than heterozygotes or rs12252-T/T patients (36) . In general, the sample size of these studies is small-for example, Everitt et al. relied on only three rs12252-C/C homozygotes-and at least one study has failed to confirm these results (33, 37) . Collectively, however, there appears to be a trend in which at least one polymorphism in the IFITM3 gene increases susceptibility to IAV.",

For example, a population of lung-resident memory CD8 + T cells (T RM ) in mice strongly express Ifitm3 following an IAV infection (38) . Furthermore, Ifitm3 upregulation by these T RM cells is not the result of nonspecific stimulation by interferons during infection but is instead contingent on antigen recognition. This point was demonstrated by introducing ovalbumin (OVA)-specific CD8 + T cells into mice that were subsequently infected with either wild-type IAV or an OVA-expressing strain. OVA-specific CD8 + T cells persistently upregulated Ifitm3 following OVA-IAV challenge but not following challenge with wildtype virus. Because Ifitm3 rendered these cells resistant to viral infection, they were not lost following a second challenge with IAV and contributed to more rapid clearance of this virus. A similar population of Ifitm3-high CD8 + memory T cells was also observed in the brains of mice responding to VSV, suggesting that Ifitm3 generally protects the CD8 + T RM cells from viral infection (39) . These findings suggest that IFITM protein expression can shape the adaptive immune response by selectively protecting subsets of immune effector cells.",

In some cases, the relative susceptibility or resistance of a virus to IFITM-mediated restriction can vary depending on cell type, virus titers, the IFITM protein in question, its expression level, and indirect consequences of IFITM overexpression. More robust investigations include a positive control (typically IAV or a retrovirus pseudotyped with IAV HA) and a negative control (typically MLV or a retrovirus pseudotyped with LASV, MACV, or MLV entry proteins) and use siRNA depletion of endogenous IFITM proteins (or IfitmDel \u2212/\u2212 or Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs) in parallel with overexpression studies. Interpretation of experimental results can be further confounded by real or artifactual perturbation of downstream steps in the virus life cycle and potential interference with host factors important in the viral entry process.

Flavivirus replication is amplified by loss of endogenous IFITM proteins, and IFITM-protein overexpression markedly suppresses viral replication. IFITM-mediated restriction is presumed to target the flavivirus entry process. However, there is a caveat with this interpretation. Because the structural proteins of flaviviruses cannot pseudotype retroviruses or VSV, all studies to date have been performed with infectious virions or viruslike particles (VLPs). Because readouts from both infectious virions and VLPs require the early activity of these nonstructural proteins, it is possible that IFITM proteins restrict steps following viral entry. However, IFITM expression does not appear to affect the efficiency of electroporated DENV replicons (40) , and given that the site of fusion of flaviviruses is similar to that of IAV, it is possible that these viruses are restricted through the same mechanism. Although not investigated with the same precision as IAV, the pattern of restriction also appears similar to that of IAV, with IFITM3 restricting these viruses and VLPs more efficiently than IFITM1 and IFITM2.",

Although these viruses are from different families, they share a dependency on the enzymatic activities of lysosomal cathepsins to activate their fusion proteins (42, 43) . Thus, they are thought to fuse later in the endocytic pathway than IAV or flaviviruses. IFITM expression does not detectably change the level of cathepsin L activity in cell lysates or the surface expression of the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 (21, 44) . SARS-CoV and filoviruses also share a pattern of restriction that is different from that of IAV. For example, SARS-CoV and filoviruses appear to be more sensitive to IFITM1 than is IAV, and unlike IAV, they can be efficiently restricted by murine Ifitm6 expressed in human cells (21) . These studies provide the first suggestion that different IFITM proteins might specialize in targeting different viruses.",

Studies of viable VSV also suggest a modest level of restriction (45) . It has been proposed that VSV fuses with the intraluminal vesicles of the late endosome/multivesicular body, which then backfuse with the limiting membrane of the multivesicular body. Although the efficiency of this process is not well understood, it may facilitate partial escape from IFITM restriction. This speculation presumes that restriction does not extend to the intraluminal vesicles and that IFITM proteins inhibit intraluminal vesicle backfusion less efficiently than viral fusion. Overexpressed human and chicken IFITM proteins also inhibit infection by retroviruses pseudotyped with the entry proteins of rabies virus and Lagos bat virus, a virus from the same genus (26) .",

Both concluded that IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 overexpression does not significantly impede HIV-1 entry in TZMbl and GHOST-CCR5 reporter-cell lines (7) . A large-scale screen of overexpressed interferon-stimulated genes in Huh cells, however, identified IFITM2 and IFITM3 as inhibitors of HIV-1 replication (4) . A parallel shRNA screen using 293T cells also identified IFITM2 and IFITM3 as limiting HIV-1 replication. Subsequent overexpression experiments using tetracycline-inducible IFITM constructs demonstrated that IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 each suppress HIV-1 replication and showed that IFITM2 and IFITM3, but not IFITM1, inhibit HIV-1 entry (47) . Although direct comparisons were not performed, the magnitude of the entry-inhibition effect of IFITM2 and IFITM3 appears to be lower than that observed with IAV or flaviviruses, with approximately 50% of infection inhibited, although larger effects were observed with HIV-1 replicating in SupT1 cells over a 2-week period. IFITM protein expression has no effect on cell-surface CD4 expression, but coreceptor levels have not been measured. IFITM1, which suppresses HIV-1 replication but not entry, inhibits an early step in the HIV-1 life cycle between integration of viral DNA and expression of the Gag protein.",

Unexpectedly, this effect is specific to proteins expressed from constructs containing transactivation-response or Rev-response elements, suggesting that IFITM proteins may modulate translation from RNA transcripts with particular secondary structures. Mutation of the palmitoylated cysteine residues of IFITM3, which causes IFITM3 mislocalization and attenuates its entry-restriction activity (49), does not alter its capacity to suppress HIV-1 protein synthesis. Collectively, these studies suggest a moderate but reproducible restriction of HIV-1 replication by the IFITM proteins.

A third group was unable to reproduce the IFITM1 effect on RNA replication but did observe a marked effect on HCV entry into hepatocytes at least in part by relocalizing the HCV receptor CD81 into tight junctions, thereby disrupting subsequent coreceptor interactions (51) . Consistent with this observation, a physical association between CD81 and IFITM1 had been established before the antiviral activities of IFITM1 were appreciated (10) .

The scale of this effect is less dramatic than in parallel studies with nonpathogenic IAV, although given the different pathologies produced by IAV and RSV, such comparisons are imperfect. Like HIV-1, RSV fuses at the plasma membrane. Therefore, RSV, and perhaps HIV-1 and HCV, may be an exception to the general rule that viruses fusing late in the endocytic pathway are most susceptible to IFITM-mediated restriction. However, RSV restriction has not been examined in cultured cells, and it is possible that IFITM proteins protect mice from RSV challenge via means other than inhibition of viral entry. An alternative explanation for this protection is that, in vivo, Ifitm3 appears to be concentrated on the apical plasma membranes of ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, the principal site of RSV entry (34, 52) .",

            "text": "The topology of the IFITM proteins in the membrane has been a source of considerable debate. Although the CIL is intracellular (57), evidence for the orientations of the N and C termini is conflicting. Early literature proposed a type III, two-pass transmembrane topology with both N and C termini oriented toward the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen or extracellular space (Figure 3a ). For example, early investigators noted that antibodies against the IFITM1 N terminus caused aggregation of leukemia cell lines, suggesting exposure of extracellular IFITM1 epitopes (14) . Furthermore, labeled IFITM1 could be recovered by immunoprecipitation after enzymatic cell-surface radiolabeling (10) . Moreover, several groups observed that IFITM proteins epitope tagged at either their N or C terminus could be recognized at the plasma membrane by flow cytometry (7, 45, 58) . However, two studies provided persuasive evidence supporting localization of the IFITM3 NTD in the cytosol. Yount et al. (49) demonstrated ubiquitylation of Lys24 of the NTD of IFITM3, implying access of this residue to cytosolic ubiquitin ligases, and noted a lack of Nlinked glycosylation of the NHT motif of the IFITM3 N terminus. Jia et al. (59) observed phosphorylation of IFITM3 Tyr20 and identified the kinase Fyn as the phosphorylating kinase, again consistent with the accessibility of the N terminus to cytosolic enzymes. Yount et al. also provided data that the IFITM3 C terminus is localized to the cytosol. These data included the capacity of a prenylation reporter to bind an artificial C-terminal CLVL motif (49) , but the prenylation motif was positioned only in a construct that also included an artificial N-terminal myristoylation motif and mutation of the palmitoylated cysteine residues. Subsequently, Hach et al. (60) detected palmitoylation of a C-terminal cysteine of murine Ifitm1, which supported a cytosolic orientation of the C terminus. On the basis of these results, Yount et al. proposed a topology in which both the NTD and CTD faced the cytosol, as did the CIL, and both IM1 and IM2 insert into but do not traverse the lipid bilayer (Figure 3b) .",

Evidence for the latter included retention in the ER of an Ifitm3 variant with a C-terminal KDEL ER retention motif. In addition, markedly greater antibody recognition of C-terminal epitope tags relative to that of N-terminal tags was seen in nonpermeabilized cells. Following permeabilization, however, N-and C-terminal tags were recognized comparably. Finally, the IM2/TM2 region traverses the membrane when expressed in isolation. Collectively, these results suggest that IM2/TM2 is indeed a transmembrane domain and that Ifitm3 exists primarily as a type II transmembrane protein (61) . Thus, IM1/TM1 is an intramembrane domain (i.e., the IMD), and IM2/TM2 is a transmembrane domain (i.e., the TMD). However, a minority fraction of expressed Ifitm3 is oriented in an alternative topology, with the NTD facing outward. It is unclear whether this topology is a complete inversion of the protein, or whether in this orientation both the NTD and the CTD face the ER lumen. The frequency of this minority topology is also not clear, and notably, it has been observed in only one of two cell lines tested. Nonetheless, the observation of two topologies helps to reconcile the older literature with clear evidence for a cytosolic orientation of the NTD.",

            "text": "IFITM proteins have two highly conserved and palmitoylated cysteines within the IMD (IFITM3 Cys71 and Cys72) and one more poorly conserved palmitoylated cysteine at the junction between the CIL and TMD (IFITM3 residue 105) (Figure 2 ). Cysteine palmitoylation is necessary for the restriction activity of IFITM3, with palmitoylation of Cys72 playing an especially important role (49, 62) . It is likely that these palmitoyl groups contribute to the stability of IFITM proteins, their appropriate subcellular localization, and their association with lipid rafts. The IFITM proteins also have four lysines that can be ubiquitylated: one in the NTD (IFITM3 Lys24) and three in the CIL (Lys83, Lys88, and Lys104). Lys48 ubiquitin linkages are observed at all four positions but are most efficient at Lys24. Lys63-linked polyubiquitin is also observed at Lys24. In general, ubiquitin appears to interfere with the antiviral activity of IFITM3, and IFITM3 with ubiquitin is more stable and better localized to the endolysosomal sites of IAV fusion (49) . It is thought that ubiquitin primarily functions to regulate IFITM3 expression, and indeed the extent of ubiquitylation observed may reflect its overexpression in HEK239T cells. It is noteworthy that all four conserved and potentially ubiquitylated IFITM3 lysines can be altered to alanine without significant loss of restriction activity. This observation suggests that their conservation is due to their role in tightly regulating IFITM protein levels and that IFITM protein overexpression may be deleterious in a physiologic context. Indeed, in some cell lines, overexpression of IFITM proteins can lead to enlarged vacuoles, consistent with dysregulation of vesicle trafficking. In addition, Lys88 is methylated by the lysine methyltransferase SET7, which inhibits IFITM3 activity for reasons that are unclear (63) .",

Phosphorylation of this residue regulates subcellular localization and restriction activity of IFITM3. Mutation of Tyr99 to alanine interferes with IFITM restriction of IAV but not DENV.

They were first detected at the cell surface by flow cytometry or through radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation (10) . An early set of confocal and immuno-electron microscopy experiments demonstrated colocalization of IFITM3 with MHC class I in the cytoplasmic vesicles of D10 and ME15 melanoma cell lines (64) . A subsequent fluorescence microscopy study of LA7 rat mammary cells identified Ifitm3 at the plasma membrane, and further investigation showed an association with Lyn and Fyn kinases in lipid rafts (65) . Subcellular distribution of these proteins varies depending on the cell or tissue type and expression level. In most monolayer cultures, IFITM proteins are concentrated in cytoplasmic vesicles that stain with late endosomal and lysosomal markers such as CD63 and LAMP2 (21, 66) . Expression of high levels exogenous IFITM proteins appears to overwhelm the cellular machinery responsible for their internalization, resulting in plasma membrane-localized protein (Figure 4a ). IFITM protein overexpression also results in enlargement of endolysosomal organelles, a phenomenon best observed with IFITM1 ( Figure 4b) (21, 66) . Confocal imaging of lung tissue from IAV-infected mice confirms the endosomal localization of Ifitm3 in vivo in most cell types, including type II pneumocytes, mesothelial cells, fibroblasts, and various leukocytes (Figure 4c) (34, 38) . Interestingly, the ciliated columnar cells of the upper airways are an exception to this rule; in these cells, Ifitm3 is localized almost entirely to the apical plasma membrane and cilia (Figure 4d) (34) . Although IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 all exhibit partial colocalization with endolysosomal markers such as CD63 (21, 66) , IFITM1 appears to reside in subcellular compartments distinct from those of IFITM2 and IFITM3, with little or no overlap observed by microscopy (46, 47) . Furthermore, the enlarged cytoplasmic vesicles that accompany overexpression of IFITM1 differ from those of IFITM3 as revealed by electron microscopy. IFITM1-associated vesicles are typically larger, and apparently empty (Figure 4e ). In contrast, IFITM3-associated endolysosomes contain intraluminal vesicles and other debris, similar to multivesicular bodies (Figure 4f) (67) .",

The comparatively short NTD of IFITM1 lacks this YXXF motif. Therefore, IFITM1 likely uses an alternative pathway for its internalization. In fact, IFITM1 shows partial colocalization with caveolin at the plasma membrane and coimmunoprecipitates with this protein (69) . Thus, whereas IFITM2 and IFITM3 are internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, IFITM1 may instead follow the caveolin pathway. The phosphorylation of Tyr20 of the IFITM3 YXXF motif by Fyn kinase inhibits internalization of IFITM3 (59) . Cell-type variability in Fyn kinase activity may therefore explain conflicting reports about the plasma membrane or endosomal localization of IFITM3.",

One potential explanation is receptor downregulation; however, although not all receptors of restricted viruses have been identified, surface expression of the receptors for IAV (sialic acid) and SARS-CoV (ACE2) is not affected by IFITM protein expression (7, 21) . Thus, receptor modulation alone cannot explain the entire spectrum of restriction. Another possible mechanism for restriction is that restricted viruses are not internalized into IFITM protein-expressing cells. Microscopy studies of IAV and reovirus internalization, however, have not identified any gross defects of virion trafficking into acidified endosomes (21, 53, 66) .",

Exceptions to this rule include HIV-1, which uses a pH-insensitive entry pathway but is partially restricted by IFITM3 (47) , and the IFITMinsensitive arenaviruses (e.g., LASV, MACV) which use pH-dependent entry processes (21, 70) . However, despite dependence on factors like cathepsins or low pH, different viruses are internalized via different endocytic pathways. For example, DENV uses a clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway (71), but LASV can apparently enter cells using clathrin-and caveolinindependent mechanisms (72, 73) .",

Evidence suggests that it might. Jia et al. (59) noted that mutation of the NTD YXXF motif of IFITM3 inhibits its internalization into endolysosomal compartments and impairs its restriction activity against IAV. Feeley et al. (66) observed that IAV genomes accumulate in IFITM3positive vesicles in infected cells, implying that these compartments are a dead end for viral endocytosis. Also in support of a location-dependent mechanism is the observation that the IFITM-restricted viruses SARS-CoV and reovirus, which use entry processes that require acid-dependent proteases, become IFITM insensitive if the protease dependence is circumvented experimentally (21, 53) . Similarly, IFITM1 and IFITM3, which localize to different subcellular compartments (46, 47) , also possess distinct patterns of viral entry restriction. IFITM1 is a potent inhibitor of filovirus entry but exhibits less efficient restriction of IAV. IFITM3 shows the opposite pattern, restricting IAV more potently than MARV or EBOV (21) . A simple explanation for these differences in restriction activity is the different localization of these IFITM proteins.",

Accepting these premises, how exactly do IFITM proteins inhibit viral entry? We envision two possibilities. First, IFITM proteins may alter properties of the endolysosomal lumina, rendering these compartments inhospitable to viral fusion. This explanation is attractive because it would explain the relative failure of IFITM proteins to inhibit viral entry at the plasma membrane. Evidence in favor of this model comes from the study of C-terminally epitope-tagged murine Ifitm3. C-terminal Ifitm3 epitope tags are cleaved upon exposure to the lysosomal lumen. Imaging of cells expressing doubly N-and C-terminally tagged Ifitm3 revealed that in most cytoplasmic vesicles, C-terminal epitope tags are cleaved from Ifitm3, but these tags are retained in the large, perinuclear vesicles that accompany IFITM protein overexpression (61) . This finding suggests a loss of proteolytic activity in these compartments. However, the physiologic relevance of these enlarged, perinuclear compartments is not clear, which questions the significance of this observation.",

Other investigators have shown, using pH-sensitive dye studies and ex vivo enzymatic activity assays, that endosomal acidification and cathepsin activity are not inhibited by IFITM protein expression (21, 66) . These results should be interpreted with caution, however, as total acidic compartment volume and bulk cathepsin activity are not necessarily indicative of the microenvironment in the lumina of IFITM protein-positive vesicles.

            "text": "A second explanation for IFITM protein activity, with mounting evidence in its favor, is that IFITM proteins alter physical properties of cellular membranes to inhibit the formation or expansion of fusion pores. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), Li et al. (58) found that overexpression of IFITM proteins causes loss of fluidity of host cell membranes. Lin et al. (74) obtained similar results using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy to show that IFITM1 inhibits lateral diffusion of plasma membrane proteins. One possible mechanism for these observations was provided by Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al. (67) , who found that IFITM3 overexpression resulted in the accumulation of cholesterol in the membranes of CD63-and LBPA-positive cellular compartments, which are presumably late endosomes. This group also identified a physical interaction between IFITM3 and VAPA (vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A), which was mapped to the IFITM3 TMD. VAPA is an ER-resident protein that modulates cholesterol homeostasis by interaction with oxysterol-binding proteins. The model is unusual in that the IFITM3-VAPA interaction was mapped to the poorly conserved TMD of IFITM3 and that the ER-resident VAPA and endosomal IFITM3 would not be expected to interact in intact cells. However, the IFITM3-mediated cholesterol enrichment in endolysosomal membranes is robust and has been independently confirmed (74) . Reports currently differ regarding the importance of the amino acid sequence of the TMD. For example, replacement of the IFITM3 TMD with the transmembrane domains of type I (CD4) or type II (transferrin receptor) transmembrane proteins resulted in a near-complete loss of IAV restriction activity (67) . However, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the IFITM3 TMD failed to identify any mutants with diminished restriction activity against IAV, even when blocks of six consecutive residues were replaced by alanines (41) . Overexpression of VAPA alone does appear to abrogate IFITM3-mediated viral entry restriction, but again, reports differ about the magnitude of the effect (67, 74) .",

(74) found that treatment of cells with the antifungal compound amphotericin B counteracts IFITM2/3-mediated restriction of IAV but has little or no effect on IFITM1mediated viral entry restriction. The same phenomenon was observed following treatment with the antifungal agent nystatin. Amphotericin B and nystatin are polyene antifungals that share a putative mechanism: They bind membrane sterols (with a preference for the fungusspecific molecule ergosterol) and form ion leak channels. Lin et al. performed a thorough analysis of this phenomenon to identify the mechanism by which polyenes prevent IFITM3mediated IAV restriction. Using fluorescent dyes, they noted that polyene antifungals abolish Na + gradients across endolysosomal membranes. However, when Na + gradients were disrupted by non-pore-forming ionophores, no effect on IFITM3 activity was detected. These findings suggest that Na + gradients do not contribute to IFITM restriction, but do not fomally exclude a role for other ion gradients. Lin et al. also investigated whether polyenes interfere with IFITM protein activity by disrupting cholesterol. They treated cells with a variety of cholesterol-modulating drugs including methyl \u03b2-cyclodextran, statins, and cholesterol itself. Ultimately, none of these treatments, nor overexpression of VAPA, mitigated the effect of amphotericin B on IFITM3 function. Thus, the mechanism underlying the effects of the polyenes remains unclear. It is possible that amphotericin B restores membrane fluidity, perhaps by disrupting a higher-order complex of IFITM proteins. Evidence for such a model could be obtained by FLIM studies of IFITMexpressing, amphotericin-treated cells, but results of such experiments have not been reported.",

(41) demonstrated that HA-tagged IFITM3 coimmunoprecipitates with untagged IFITM3 molecules and that this interaction is lost through the combined mutation of IMD residues Phe75 and Phe78 to alanines. Furthermore, this mutant shows no IAV restriction activity. The authors proposed that, like other proteins with intramembrane domains, IFITM3 induces membrane curvature. This model suggests that IFITM3 dimers deform endosomal membranes and make fusion pore formation energetically unfavorable. This possibility is intriguing, especially considering that IFITM proteins from distantly related species (e.g., chickens) retain much of their activity in human cells, but there are caveats to the interpretation of these studies. For example, IFITM3 also coimmunoprecipitates with tagged IFITM1, yet in living cells these two proteins show little colocalization (46) ; this suggests that the observed interactions may occur following cell lysis. Another caveat arises from the use of 0.5% CHAPSO detergent in these coimmunoprecipitation studies. IFITM3 is localized to detergent-resistant microdomains (lipid rafts) and may coimmunoprecipitate nonspecifically with other lipid raft proteins (e.g., other IFITM3 molecules) following lysis with a detergent as gentle as CHAPSO. Therefore, an alternative interpretation of these results is that Phe75 and Phe78 are required for lipid raft incorporation.",

            "text": "Over the past several years, IFITM proteins have been recognized as key components of cell-intrinsic defense against several pathogenic viruses. In particular, IFITM3 and its orthologs play a direct and important role in controlling the severity of influenza in mice and likely in humans. These proteins also account for a surprisingly large fraction of the capacity of interferon-treated cells to suppress IAV replication. IFITM proteins are expressed constitutively by cells and tissues where their protective effects would be especially important, for example, barrier epithelial cells in the lung or lung-resident CD8 + memory T cells. Based on cell culture data, IFITM3 is likely to make a similar contribution to reducing the severity of diseases caused by flaviviruses, including DENV and WNV, which appear to be internalized through pathways similar to those used by IAV. Similarly, IFITM1 or IFITM3 might contribute to the control of EBOV, reovirus, SARS-CoV, and various bunyaviruses through similar mechanisms. Multiple or alternative IFITM-mediated mechanisms might also assist in the control of HCV, HIV-1, RSV, and perhaps others. Of equal interest are those viruses that remain unaffected by expression of IFITM proteins. It remains unclear how these viruses evade restriction and why restricted viruses do not readily escape restriction through the same means. Important questions about mechanisms of IFITM-mediated restriction are unanswered. There is a good deal of circumstantial evidence that IFITM proteins alter the site of fusion, but it remains unclear exactly how this occurs; whether these changes occur primarily in the lumina, membrane, or cytoplasm; and what cofactor and target proteins are involved. Beyond the puzzle of defining mechanisms, a final challenge is to translate these emerging insights into strategies to prevent and treat viral diseases. There are several means by which this might be accomplished. First, once we understand the mechanism of restriction, we might be able screen for compounds that mimic this activity. Second, we might find an interferon-independent means of inducing expression of IFITM proteins at the transcriptional level-also, ideally, with a small molecule. Third, extending from the observation that cytokines other than type I and II interferons, namely those that use the signaling receptor gp130, also stimulate IFITM expression (34) , it might be possible to specify with more precision which cell types, or perhaps which IFITM proteins, can be expressed. This approach could bypass the undesirable or unpleasant effects of interferon administration. Another approach targets key animal intermediates in zoonosis. Transgenic chickens, ducks, or pigs overexpressing Ifitm3 in IAV target cells are likely to be viable and more resistant to influenza. Finally, as we begin to better understand how human polymorphisms in the IFITM locus contribute to varying responses to viral infections, we can respond more effectively with efforts to protect against or treat these infections.

Again, these animals showed no obvious developmental defects. Two groups characterized the susceptibility of Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice to IAV infection. Everitt et al. (33) challenged these mice and their wild-type littermates with a relatively nonpathogenic murine-adapted H3N2 IAV strain (A/X-31) as well as with a 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain (A/09 Eng/195). Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice consistently lost >25% of their body weight by day 6 and were euthanized. In contrast, their wild-type littermates lost <25% of their body weight and recovered. Bailey et al. (34) challenged both Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 and IfitmDel \u2212/\u2212 with a pathogenic H1N1 strain (A/PR/8/34) and observed a more rapid loss of weight in these mice compared with their wild-type littermates. As observed by Everitt et al., all of the knockout mice exhibited weight loss of >20% by day 6 and were euthanized. Approximately 60% of wildtype mice also lost >20% of their body weight by day 7-8, whereas the remainder recovered. Intermediate responses were noted with heterozygotes of both lines of mice, demonstrating a gene-dosage effect for Ifitm3. No differences were observed between IfitmDel \u2212/\u2212 and Ifitm3 \u2212/\u2212 mice or between IfitmDel +/\u2212 and Ifitm3 +/\u2212 heterozygotes, indicating that the murine Ifitm3 plays an especially important role in controlling an IAV infection. Both groups noted that lesions were confined to the respiratory tract. Although Bailey et al. noted the presence of viral RNA in the spleens of IfitmDel \u2212/\u2212 animals, they found no histologic evidence of infection at this site.
