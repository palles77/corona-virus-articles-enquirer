Fluid therapy administration due to dehydration, average weight gain, and the fecal microbiome were also evaluated. Bull calves used in this study were born from normal parturition, fed 4 L of pooled pasteurized colostrum by esophageal feeder, and moved to a research facility at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). A doubleblinded randomized clinical trial was designed to allocate a total of 40 newborn calves into 1 of 2 treatment groups: calves receiving (twice daily) a solution containing 500 mg of SB-300 added to the whole milk for the first 15 d of life (SB-300, n = 20) or a control group receiving sterile water added to whole milk for the same period (CTR, n = 20). Treatment solutions had a total volume of 10 mL per treatment. Data regarding fecal dry matter were collected to precisely measure water content in fecal samples and to define diarrhea events; the SB-300 group had significantly increased fecal dry matter during the study period. Additionally, significantly fewer events of diarrhea were observed for calves in the SB-300 group (16.9%) compared with calves in the CTR group (46.5%). Dehydration status was evaluated and treated accordingly; calves with moderate dehydration were offered oral electrolytes, and calves with severe dehydration were rescued with intravenous fluid therapy. Calves in the SB-300 group had fewer intravenous fluid therapies administered during the study period (1.6%) compared with the CTR group (3.1%). Overall fluid therapy administered (oral electrolytes plus intravenous fluids) was significantly higher for the CTR group (9.2%) compared with the SB-300 group (6.1%) during the study period. No differences in milk consumption, calf starter intake, or weight gain were observed between treatment groups. A single time increase in Bifidobacterium was observed on d 20 of life for the SB-300 group; otherwise, no differences in fecal microbiome profile were detected between treatment groups. These results suggest that 500 mg of SB-300 added to the milk for 15 d can reduce the incidence of diarrhea and reduce severe dehydration in milk-fed calves.",

To avoid subjectivity from visually scoring calves with diarrhea based on fecal consistency, diarrhea was defined after data on fecal DM were collected.

In this study, the hypothesis behind the microbiome investigation was that lesser secretion of water during an event of secretory diarrhea would lead to a more stable microbiome, possibly favoring beneficial bacteria that could lead to improved performance. During events of diarrhea triggered by E. coli, rotavirus, and coronavirus, the intestinal lumen can create a favorable environment for overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria (Tzipori et al., 1981 (Tzipori et al., , 1983 Kaske, 1993) . The neonatal calf intestinal microbiota is dynamic during the first week of life, and different intestinal microbiota profiles can be associated with disease and weight gain (Uyeno Oikonomou et al., 2013; Malmuthuge et al., 2015) . In neonatal calves, the beneficial effects of decreasing diarrhea incidence and improving weight gain in calves have been reported when a higher prevalence of certain bacterial genera exists; namely Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Fecalibacterium (Abe et al., 1995; Foditsch et al., 2015) . In the current study, fecal swabs were collected during treatment days for metagenomic sequencing, and no differences in relative abundance between treatment groups were detected for the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Fecalibacterium. Fecal swabs were also collected on d 20 and 25; a difference was observed on d 20 only for Bifidobacterium between treatment groups, where calves in the SB-300 Figure 5 .
