Together with our social, occupational, and personal life, the new corona virus poses novel challenges for all physicians, including dermatologists. Despite the virus not being dermatotropic, several skin conditions have emerged, mainly as a result of prolonged contact to personal protective equipment and excessive personal hygiene. Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, and exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis and acne, have been described. We have focused on the dermatologic aspects of COVID-19 infection, so that dermatologist may be aware of the skin complications and the preventive measures to be taken in the COVID-19 pandemic. Abbreviations: healthcare workers -HCWs personal protective equipment -PPE Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f identified as the most common entry for the infection, this includes the conjunctiva with the otic canal having the lowest risk of transmission (4); therefore, specific skin changes due to Covid-19 infection have not been described, and one could expect iatrogenic secondary involvement of the skin. Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 Because diseases with epidermal barrier interruption could enhance the virus acquisition through indirect contact (5), dermatology patients might be at an increased risk for developing the infection. This suggests that dermatology departments and private offices should develop appropriate preventative measures. (5). Use of a sanitary mask itself may not be sufficient protection from the virus transmission, so that goggles should be used to decrease the risk of conjunctival contamination. COVID-19 has a relatively low-resistance to disinfectants. As a result, a variety of regimens have been proven effective, ranging from 75% ethanol, peracetic acid, chlorine, and UV disinfection to a hot water bath at 56\u00b0C(132.8\u00b0F) for 30 minutes (4).",
