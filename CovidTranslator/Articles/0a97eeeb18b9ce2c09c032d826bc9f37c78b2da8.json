( Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The etiology is believed to have both immune-mediated and en-vironmental components, particularly virus infection. [1] [2] [3] [4] Experimental autoimmune (allergic) encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection have been used to study the possible autoimmune and viral mechanisms for MS. 5 EAE can be induced in animals with a subcutaneous injection of CNS antigen emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant or adoptive transfer of CNS antigen-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells. TMEV is a nonenveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded RNA virus, belonging to the genus Cardiovirus, family Picornaviridae. 6 Intracerebral infection of TMEV causes an inflammatory demyelinating disease in the CNS in susceptible mouse strains. The two models are similar to MS clinically and histologically, in which cellular and humoral immune responses are believed to play important roles in the pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Pathological and neuroimaging studies in MS reported the presence of axonal degeneration, including Wallerian degeneration. 7, 8 Immunostaining studies have provided direct evidence of axonal damage using antibodies against two markers for damaged axons: nonphosphorylated neurofilament 9 and amyloid precursor protein. 10 This approach made possible the identification of earlier and subtler changes in axons than those seen by silver staining. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that axonal damage also occurs in animal models for MS, including EAE and TMEV infection. 11, 12 New imaging techniques have been used to evaluate axonal damage in MS. These techniques include measuring T1 hypointense lesions or T1 \"black holes,\" magnetization transfer imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and determining spinal and cerebral atrophy. 13 Some studies have shown that it is axonal loss and dysfunction rather than demyelination that is responsible for the subsequent disability observed in MS. In addition, although Wallerian degeneration in the CNS was thought to be a rare occurrence in MS, autopsy and magnetic resonance imaging studies have demonstrated Wallerian degeneration in patients with MS. 14 -17 Important insight into the mechanisms of axonal degeneration came with findings in C57BL/Wld s (C57/ OlaHsd-Wld, Wallerian degeneration slow mutant) (Wld) mice, which are a substrain of C57BL/6 (B6) mice and have prolonged survival of the distal stumps of transected axons. 18 -20 Transected axons from Wld mice survive for up to 4 weeks, support action potentials for at least 2 weeks, and continue anterograde and retrograde transport of proteins for similar amounts of time. [21] [22] [23] Genetic studies have attributed this slow Wallerian degeneration phenotype to the overexpression of a fusion protein (Wld s ) that is composed of the N-terminal 70 amino acids of ubiquitin fusion degradation protein 2a (Ufd2a), a ubiquitin-chain assembly factor, fused to the complete sequence of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (Nmnat1), an enzyme in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biosynthesis pathway. 24 Both the ubiquitin proteasome system and Nmnat1 have been shown to play an important role in axonal degeneration. 25 Wang and colleagues 26 demonstrated that NAD levels decreased in degenerating axons and that the exogenous application of NAD or its precursor, nicotinamide, prevented axonal degeneration.",

For example, TMEV has been shown to spread in the CNS, via axonal flow. Thus, preservation of axons during TMEV infection should favor virus spread in the CNS. To test whether the delay of axonal degeneration could affect disease severity in an autoimmune and a viral model for MS, we induced EAE and TMEV infection in B6 mice and Wld mice. In EAE during the acute stage, both mouse strains showed a similar disease clinically, histologically, and immunologically. During the chronic stage, Wld mice had no clinical signs with a decline in myelin-specific T-cell responses. In contrast, B6 mice showed disease progression both clinically and histologically with high levels of myelinspecific T-cell lymphoproliferation. Interestingly, in TMEV infection, although B6 mice had no clinical disease, Wld mice developed paralysis. Wld mice had increased inflammation, virus antigen-positive cells, and TMEV-specific lymphoproliferative responses compared with B6 mice. Therefore, axonal degeneration can play contrasting roles (beneficial versus detrimental) depending on the type of disease.",

Previously, we and others proposed two hypotheses for how axons are damaged in demyelinating lesions. 11, 36 The first one is that axons are damaged secondarily to myelin and/or oligodendrocyte damage. In this model, lesions develop from the outside (myelin) to the inside (axon) (Outside-In model). On the other hand, in spinal cord injury 37 and TMEV infection, axonal damage precedes demyelination, in which lesions develop from the inside (axon) to the outside (myelin) (Inside-Out model). Similar pathology has been described in other viral infections in the CNS, including murine hepatitis virus infection. 38 In our experiments, both B6 and Wld mice with EAE had a similar disease onset and severity during the first 2 weeks after MOG sensitization. MOG-specific T-cell proliferative responses were also similar between the two mouse strains during this period. We expected these results, because no immunological deficit has been reported in Wld mice. However, from 3 weeks after MOG sensitization, only B6 mice had enhanced anti-MOG immune responses with severe axonal damage and demyelination. This suggests associations among axonal degeneration, enhanced anti-MOG immune responses and disease progression in B6 mice. Although MOG-specific CD8 \u03e9 T-cell responses have been reported in B6 mice, 39 we could not detect CD8 \u03e9 T cells specific for MOG in B6 mice. We also tested whether epitope spreading oc-curred in B6 mice, because B6 can mount T-cell responses against MBP. 40, 41 However, we did not detect lymphoproliferative responses against MBP in B6 mice. Thus, enhancement of MOG-specific responses in B6 mice was attributable to enhancement of MHC class II restricted CD4 \u03e9 T-cell proliferation, and neither MOGspecific CD8 \u03e9 T-cell proliferation nor MBP-specific T-cell proliferation was detected.",

During the chronic stage, Wld mice developed axonal degener-ation, but this did not lead to an exacerbation of demyelinating disease 2 months after EAE induction. This is likely attributable to anti-MOG T-cell responses that have subsided in Wld mice at this chronic stage. Here, even though axonal degeneration begins to occur at 2 months, there is no (activated) MOG-specific T cells present in the periphery to be recruited into the CNS. Another possibility is that regulatory T (Treg) cells are present at this later time point that would modulate the MOG-specific memory T cells. Thus, no enhancement of anti-MOG-specific responses occurs, although myelin antigen might be presented in the CNS after myelin degeneration secondary to axonal degeneration. If this hypothesis is true, treatment that intervenes at any of the steps of the cascade reaction and causes a long enough delay in advancement to the following steps would prevent disease progression.

Thus, we wondered if a lack of Wallerian degeneration could also be beneficial in TMEV infection, in which lesions develop from the inside (axon) to the outside (myelin) (Inside-Out model). We found that, during TMEV infection, neuropathology and virus replication in the CNS were similar between B6 and Wld mice 1 week after TMEV infection. However, 3 weeks after infection, clinical signs, substantial inflammation, and virus persistence were present only in Wld mice. Because TMEV is known to infect neurons and to spread using axonal flow during the acute stage of infection, delayed axonal degeneration in Wld mice could favor virus transport and persistence in the CNS (Figure 11b ). Active virus spread and replication in Wld mice most likely resulted in enhanced TMEV-specific lymphoproliferative responses compared with those measured in B6 mice. In contrast, rapid induction of axonal degeneration in B6 mice would prevent virus dissemination and persistence in the CNS (Figure 11b ). This hypothesis is in accord with our previous finding that the DA strain of TMEV induced obvious axonal degeneration 2 weeks after infection. 12 Thus, in B6 mice, virus may spread in axons during the first week of TMEV infection, but induction of axonal degeneration at 2 to 3 weeks after infection could prevent further virus spread in the CNS. If this hypothesis is correct, Wallerian degeneration might be a self-destructive defense mechanism that protects from the transport of toxic substances, including virus, in the CNS. 19 TMEV induced a biphasic disease in Wld mice. The paralytic disease seen during the first 5 weeks of infection can be explained by prolonged gray matter inflammation (polioencephalomyelitis) with active virus spread Figure 11 . Possible mechanisms of disease progression in B6 and Wld mice with EAE (a) and TMEV infection (b). a: In B6 mice with EAE, anti-myelin autoimmune T cells first damage myelin from the outside, leading to secondary axonal damage (orange), in which lesions develop from the outside to the inside (Outside-In model). If axonal damage is severe, this will lead to Wallerian degeneration of the distal stumps of axons. Then, myelin sheaths that wrap degenerated axons would degenerate secondarily, and be phagocytized by microglia/macrophages. Here, lesions develop from the inside (axon) to the outside (myelin) (Inside-Out model). Myelin antigen will be presented by APCs and further activate myelin-specific T cells, leading to the second cascade reaction and disease development. In Wld mice, although MOG sensitization induces a similar level of anti-myelin autoimmune responses and neuropathology, a lack of or slow Wallerian degeneration intervenes in the vicious cycle (red open arrow), which results in suppression of disease progression. b: TMEV (blue) spreads in the CNS via axonal transport. In B6 mice, induction of axonal degeneration prevents virus dissemination in the CNS. In Wld mice, axonal preservation favors virus dissemination and persistence in the CNS. and persistence in neurons and axons. However, during the late chronic stage of TMEV infection, we found muscle pathology but no CNS pathology, such as demyelination, or virus persistence in mice with paralysis. Thus, the late chronic disease in Wld mice is markedly different from demyelinating disease in susceptible mice infected with TMEV.",

Intraperitoneal infection of the DA strain of TMEV has been reported to induce cardiac and skeletal muscle disease in various strains of 10-to 14day-old mice, including B6 mice. 46 In this model, severe necrotizing myositis was comprised of T cells, peaking at 3 weeks after infection, having characteristics of muscle pathology. In the muscle, virus antigen was detectable during the acute stage of TMEV infection.

Poliomyelitis is caused by poliovirus, which belongs to the same family as TMEV, Picornaviridae. Risk factors for the development of PPS include the severity of the acute poliomyelitis. 48 The cause of PPS is unknown. The leading hypothesis is that an excessive metabolic stress on remaining motor neurons throughout many years eventually results in the dropout of the new nerve terminals and the motor neurons themselves. The role of virological or immunological mechanisms in the development of PPS has not yet been substantiated. In the muscle, a mixture of myopathic and neuropathic features including group atrophy and nuclear clumps has been reported. 49, 50 Perivascular or interstitial inflammatory cells were also found in some patients.

Although a lack of axonal degeneration seemed to be beneficial in TMEV infection in B6 mice, this might not be the case in which TMEV infection occurs in susceptible strains, such as SJL/J mice. TMEVinfected SJL/J mice can develop not only anti-virus im-mune responses but also anti-myelin immune responses such as antibody against galactocerebroside and T-cell proliferative responses against myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), by molecular mimicry and epitope spreading. 51 These anti-myelin immune responses have been suggested to exacerbate demyelination induced by TMEV. Thus, in TMEV-susceptible mice, viral persistence as well as immune responses against virus and myelin antigens can play an important role in demyelination. In this scenario, preservation of axons can be a double-edged sword. Preservation of axons could interrupt a cascade reaction composed of anti-myelin immune responses and axonal degeneration, but at the same time, it could favor virus spread in the CNS. Because TMEV disseminates within axons only during the acute stage, and epitope spreading to the myelin antigens occurs only during the late chronic stage, preservation of axons could be detrimental during the acute stage, but be beneficial during the late chronic stage in susceptible mice infected with TMEV. This can be addressed in future experiments, such as inhibition of axonal transport only during the acute stage, or using mice with the Wld mutation in a TMEV-susceptible genetic background.",

Therefore, experiments using Wld mice should not only help to elucidate roles of axonal injury, but clarify the role of the Wld s gene product and its therapeutic potential in axonal degeneration. However, in our current study, we demonstrated that axonal degeneration could play contrasting roles (beneficial versus detrimental) depending on the initiator of disease, autoimmune versus virus.
