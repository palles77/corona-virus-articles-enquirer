In this study, we compared the synonymous codon usage patterns between the nucleocapsid and spike genes of CoVs, and C-type lectin domain (CTLD) genes of human and mouse on the codon basis. Findings indicate that the nucleocapsid genes of CoVs were affected from the synonymous codon usage bias than spike genes, and the CTLDs of human and mouse partially overlapped with the nucleocapsid genes of CoVs. In addition, we observed that CTLDs which showed the similar relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) patterns with CoVs were commonly derived from the human chromosome 12, and mouse chromosome 6 and 12, suggesting that there might be a specific genomic region or chromosomes which show a more similar synonymous codon usage pattern with viral genes. Our findings contribute to developing the codon-optimization method in DNA vaccines, and further study is needed to determine a specific correlation between the codon usage patterns and the chromosomal locations in higher organisms.",

First, the primers specific to the target regions of viral genome are produced to generate cDNA fragments. Second, these cDNA fragments are inserted into a bacterial DNA vaccine plasmid such as escherichia coli plasmid, and lately, the prepared DNA vaccine is injected into the cells of the target organisms such as mouse, rabbit or human subjects to produce one or more specific proteins by mimicking viral replication and protein produc- nd and 3 rd codon position. The first two factors from the principal component analysis (PRIN1 and PRIN2) were presented with each eigenvalue proportion. Nucleocapsid (A) and spike (B) coding genes of Coronavirus genus were compared with CTLD genes of human (homo sapiens) and mouse (mus musculus) species (C, D).

Because these proteins are recognised as foreign antigens in the target organisms, immune responses are triggered by them (Sin and Weiner, 2000; Donnelly et al., 2003) .

According to Wang et al. (2006a Wang et al. ( , 2006b and Ramakrishna et al. (2004) , the codon optimization of the Tat and envelope genes of HIV-1 as well as hemagglutinin genes of influenza A virus showed better antigen expression and immunogenicity in model animals such as mouse and rabbit. Each target gene of HIV-1 and influenza A virus was known to be changed to the preferred codons of the overall mammalian system to promote better expression of each encoded protein.",

            "text": "Synonymous codons usually encode common amino acids in protein synthesis, and they are not used randomly, with some codons being used more frequently than others (Moriyama and Hartl, 1993; McInerney, 1998; Duret, 2002; Lynn et al., 2002; Kawabe and Miyashita, 2003; Singer and Hickey, 2003) . Codon usage bias has been known to mirror tRNA abundance in the early studies using Bacillus subtilis and Caenorhabditis elegans genes (Shields and Sharp, 1987; Stenico et al., 1994) . In prokaryotes, such as thermophilic bacteria, highly expressed genes shift their codon usage toward a more restricted set of preferred synonymous codons compared to less highly expressed genes within the genome (Lynn et al., 2002; Singer and Hickey, 2003) . As for the viral genomes, Gu et al. (2004) reported that the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of Nidovirales family including SARS-CoV are virus-specific, and translational selection and gene length may not affect the codon usage pattern in some viruses. However, Jenkins and Holmes (2003) who analyzed the extent of codon usage bias in the complete genomic coding region of 50 genetically and ecologically diverse human RNA viruses using the effective number of codon (ENC) as a parameter showed that the overall extent of codon usage bias was low and that there was little variation in bias between genes. More recently, Shackelton et al. (2006) reported that there was a striking difference in CpG content between DNA virus with large and small genomes as the majority of large genome viruses show the expected frequency of CpG, while most small genome viruses had CpG contents far below expected values. They suggested that the main reason for these differences might be due to the differences in the viral replication and repairing mechanisms, such as cellular or viral replicative machinery. In our previous study, synonymous codon usage patterns among RNA viruses such as influenza A viruses and HIV-1s were divided into each region, subtype, host or occurring-year group, with an expectation that there might be some correlations between the nucleotide patterns and the direction of viral variations on the codon basis (Ahn and Son, 2006, 2007; Ahn et al., 2006) . Furthermore, van Hemert et al. (2007) reported that the recent evolution of astroviruses was associated with a switch in nucleotide composition and codon usage among non-human mammalian versus human/avian astroviruses. They suggested that evolutionary events within a virus family might be driven by forces operational at the level of synonymous substitutions, such as nucleotide composition, translational selection, and codon usage.",

C-type lectins, a supeframily of proteins containing C-type lectin domains (CTLDs), are a large group of extracellular Metazoan proteins with diverse functions (Zelensky and Gready, 2005) . They usually provide Ca 2+ -dependent sugar-recognition activity and initiate a various kinds of biological processes, such as adhesion, endocytosis, and pathogen neutralization (Drickamer and Dodd, 1999; Dodd and Drickamer, 2001) . As a point of immune responses, C-type lectins are also known to perform an important function in dendritic cell (DC) immune regulations, which include the triggering of inflammatory cytokines, as well as delivering antigens to T cell to initiate the specific immune response (Cella et al., 1997 (Cella et al., , 1999 . C-type lectin receptors in DCs have been determined to act as a capture of attachment factor for influenza A virus (H5N1 subtype) or HIV-1 (Lambert et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008) , and SARS-CoV infection is also known to induce a immune responses related with DC functions such as delaying an activation of alpha interferon (Spiegel et al., 2006) . In this study, we compared the synonymous codon usage patterns of Coronavirus genus with the CTLD genes of human (homo sapiens) and mouse (mus musculus) to investigate the possible relations between microbes and their host species in codon basis.",

So we compared the RSCU profiles of each gene to analyze the different patterns more intensively (Figure 3 ). The nucleocapsid and spike genes of human and bat SARS-CoVs ( Figure 3A and 3B) were compared with the two types of CTLD genes such as human clec4C_1 and mouse clec14A which were included in 'group 1' in Figure 2B , and human clec10A_2 and mouse clec4F which were not included in group 1 ( Figure 3C and 3D) . First of all, nucleocapsid genes of human and bat SARS-CoVs did not use two synonymous codons for cysteine (CYS) as well as ACG for threonine (THR), and showed similar patterns with the spike genes in alanine (ALA), asparagine (ASN), glutamine (GLN), glycine (GLY), proline (PRO), serine (SER) and threonine encoding codon groups ( Figure 3A and 3B). In the phenylalanine (PHE) and the first three codons of leucine (LEU) encoding codons, however, nucleocapsid and spike genes showed somewhat opposite patterns from each other, and spike showed more biased patterns in CCU and UCU which encode proline and serine, respectively. Secondly, human and mouse CTLD genes in Figure 3C and 3D showed common RSCU profiles with SARS-CoVs in the alanine and proline encoding codon groups, but used different patterns from SARS-CoVs in glycine and phenylalanine codon groups. As for the human clec4C_1 and mouse clec14A, they showed similar RSCU profiles with spike genes in the arginine and serine coding groups, and human clec4C_1 alone showed the same patterns with nucleocapsid genes in the isoleucine (ILE) and serine encoding groups. The human clec10A_2 and mouse clec4F showed more biased patterns in leucine and serine encoding codons than those of the group 1 CLECs ( Figure 3D ).",

Among the two genes of CoVs, the nucleocapsid genes showed highly positive eigenvectors of GC3rd (0.978) along with the PRIN2, and this pattern was also observed when we compared all the target genes from CoVs, human and mouse together using the principal factor analysis (Table 1) . Traditionally, spike protein is known to define the viral tropism by its receptor specificity and also by its membrane fusion activity during virus entry into cells, so it has been the major target of neutralizing antibodies in vaccine development (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . Recently, however, the nucleocapsid also has been studied as a new viral target protein in vaccine industry because of its good immunogenicity (Bode et al., 2003; Ye et al., 2007) . As for hepatitic C virus (HCV), the nucleocapsid protein is known to play an important role in immune evasion, including the inhibition of IFN-\u03b1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation of STAT1 in hepatic cells (Bode et al., 2003) . The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV itself has become a potential candidate for DNA vaccine production because it revealed a critical role in viral infection process (Zhu et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2007; Mark et al., 2008; Schulze et al., 2008) . Ye et al. reported that the nucleocapsid gene of mouse hepatitis virus A59, a group 2 CoV, circumvented the effects of the type I interferon (2007) . Furthermore, Okada and his colleagues reported that mice vaccinated with the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV showed T-cell immune responses, and Gao resulted that SARS DNA vaccine encoding nucleocapsid protein generated INF-\u03b3 producing T-cells in rhesus monkeys (Gao et al., 2003; Okada et al., 2005) . Our finding demonstrated that GC3rd of nucleocapsid genes revealed highly positive relationships along with the RPIN2 among CoV species, whereas spikes did not show any specific patterns related to GC3rd. This result implicates that the nucleocapsid genes of CoVs might be more heavily affected by the synonymous codon usage bias which is usually determined by the nucleotide on the third codon position than spike genes ( Figure  1A and 1B) .",

As a result, the nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoVs from both human and bat showed the most biased patterns (0.292) among CoVs along with Dim2, which showed the significant correlations with the GC 3rd (R 2 =0.50, P \uff1c 0.0001) of those genes in linear regression test (Table 2) , and CTLDs of both human and mouse were broadly distributed on the first quadrant ( Figure 2B ). Interestingly, the group 1 CTLDs of human species were derived from the chromosome 12, and those of mouse were from the chromosome 6 and 12, whereas other CTLDs were from chromosome 14, 16, 17 or 19 for human, and 6, 8 or 9 for mouse. Our finding suggests clue that there might be a specific genomic region or chromosomes, which show a more similar synonymous codon usage pattern with antigenic viral genes. Recently, DNA vaccine has become a more and more important part of vaccine development against many infectious viruses (Martin et al., 2006 (Martin et al., , 2007 Catanzaro et al., 2007) , and the codon-optimization method which switches the synonymous codons of viruses to those of their host organisms has been reported to improve the immunogenicity of HIV-1 and influenza A virus (Ramakrishna et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006a Wang et al., , 2006b . For now, the preferred codons of the overall mammalian system are used in the codon-optimization process, but we observed that there were various synonymous codon biases even among CTLD genes of both human and mouse species. Although those differences might be due to the chromosomal region which each gene was transcribed from, or other factors, one thing is clear that the preferred codons of host organisms are more various than we thought. In the case of CTLDs of human and mouse host, the group 1 genes were commonly transcribed from the chromosome 6 or 12.",

As a result, the nucleocapsid genes of both human and bat SARS-CoVs did not use two synonymous codons for cysteine as well as ACG for threonine at all ( Figure 3A) , whereas other CoVs used them (data not shown). Among SARS-CoVs, the RSCU profile showed somewhat different patterns between the nucleocapsid and spike genes, especially in the phenylalanine and leucine encoding codons, and spike showed more biased patterns in U-ended codons such as CCU (RSCU = 2.34), and UCU (RSCU = 2.67) for profile and serine, respectively. In general, the RSCU value would be 1.00 if there is no codon usage bias. As for the human clec4C_1 and mouse clec14A, they showed very similar profiles with spike genes, especially with bat SARS-CoV, in the arginine coding groups, showing the high RSCU values over 2.50 in AGA. The human clec10A_2 and mouse clec4F showed more biased patterns in GC-ending codons such as CUC, CUG and UCC for leucine and serine encoding codons than those of the group 1 CLECs ( Figure 3D) .",

Furthermore, we showed that the group 1 CTLDs of human species were commonly derived from the chromosome 12, and those of mouse were from the chromosome 6 and 12. This suggests that there might be a specific genomic region or chromosomes which show a more similar synonymous codon usage pattern with viral genes. We also found the similar results between CoV genes and other human or mouse genes in our preliminary stage (data not shown). Our findings might be helpful for developing the codon-optimization method in DNA vaccines, and further study is necessary to determine a specific correlation between the codon usage patterns of coding sequences and the chromosomal locations where they are transcribed from in higher organisms.",

The RSCU value is the number of times that a particular codon is observed relative to the number of times that the codon would be observed in the absence of any codon usage bias. If there is no codon usage bias, the RSCU value is 1.00. The RSCU was calculated as where Xij is the frequency of occurrence of the jth codon for the ith amino acid, and ni is the number of codons for the ith amino acid. Each gene is represented as a 59-dimensional vector excluding the start and stop codons and UGG, which codes for tryptophan which has no synonyms (Sharp and Li, 1986) . We assigned each kind of gene or species as rows, and RSCU values of 59 codons as columns in an input data set for CA. The biplot graph from a CA includes the best two dimensional representations of the data, along with the coordinates of the plotted points, and a measure of the amount of information retained in each dimension. CA uses chi-square to standardize the frequency values, so the distance between two coordinates with the same row or column value indicates the chi-square distance (Hair et al., 1998) . If this distance is long enough to have statistical meaning, the coordinates of the output plots along with each column or row direction will be located far from the origin, and they usually exist on the opposite side of each coordinate axis. The distance between each row or each column reveals the Euclidean distance (Gu et al., 2004; Perriere and Thioulouse, 2002) , but there is no meaning between the row and column coordinates.",
