Approximately 3% of children under the age of 1 year are hospitalized annually for bronchiolitis, and the cost of hospitalization is estimated to exceed $700 million (2, 3) . Although bronchiolitis is a common disease that is readily diagnosed clinically, the standard of practice for diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis is still a source of debate. To address these concerns, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) developed and published a clinical practice guideline in 2006. This Guideline recommends that diagnosis be based on history and physical examination, and discourages virologic testing on the basis that results rarely impact management decisions. The Guideline states, however, that virologic testing may be useful when patient cohorting is possible (3) .",

The development of more sensitive diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction assays (PCR), has increased the number of viruses (e.g., human metapnuemovirus) detected in children with acute respiratory tract infections (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Most previous studies of respiratory viruses in children using molecular diagnostics have focused on children with a spectrum of respiratory tract infections some of which have been associated with acute wheezing (7, 8, 12) .

Residual clinical nasal wash samples were collected from children of all ages presenting with respiratory symptoms to the emergency department or inpatient at Children's Hospital Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington between October 2003 and April 2004. October through April encompasses the period of greatest respiratory virus activity in our region. In total, 831 nasal wash samples with sufficient residual material were available for testing by real-time PCR as previously published (13) . The current study includes a subset of these samples, specifically those obtained from patients less than 24 months of age with bronchiolitis. Billing records were obtained from patients with residual nasal wash samples. Bronchiolitis was defined by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes for bronchiolitis (#466. 11, #466.19 ). Based on this definition, 180 infants less than 24 months of age were included in our study population. Each eligible patient contributed only one sample to the analysis. When a single child had multiple hospital visits and/or samples, the earliest sample was selected for this analysis. Clinical data were abstracted from medical records using a standardized form. Demographic information including age, gender, and underlying diseases or conditions were recorded.",

Patient respiratory samples were later analysed by multiplex real-time PCR without prior knowledge of the FA result for the following viruses: RSV, adenovirus, hMPV, coronavirus, PIV types 1-3, and influenza. PCR was performed on total nucleic acids isolated from frozen nasal wash samples using a previously described one-step reversetranscription PCR master mix for RNA viruses and a master mix for adenovirus DNA (13) (14) (15) . Primer and probe sequences were designed using Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as previously described (13) (14) (15) . Prior studies indicate that the FA and real-time PCR viral testing was strongly correlated for both RSV and influenza. PCR was more sensitive than FA for PIV and adenovirus (13) .",

A study by Ong et al. of 50 infants with RSV bronchiolitis hospitalized during a one-month period identified dual infection in 5 (10%) patients (9) . A study by Greensill et al. of 30 infants with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation reported a 70% co-infection rate among hMPV and RSV (16) . A coinfection rate of 9% was reported by Mansbach et al. in a multicentre study that sampled children with bronchiolitis for two to three-week periods (10) . Only one previous study was population-based, representing a full viral respiratory season. This study, set in Greece, included 119 infants less than 1 year of age with bronchiolitis.

In our study, we identified co-infections in 41 (23%) children with bronchiolitis despite not testing for RV.

Using more sensitive assays, we found that of the 139 children with RSV detected, 34 (24%) were infected with another pathogen and most of these pathogens are not detected well or at all with current FA assays. Interpreting copathogen data with organisms such as coronavirus or adenovirus is problematic due to the difficulty in differentiating acute disease from long-term shedding and the extent that bronchiolitis may be caused or exacerbated by these other viruses has not been definitively established. Our results suggest that the issue of viral testing merits further investigation as it has the potential to impact patient cohorting and management algorithms (18) .",
