Coronaviruses induce an MS-like disease in rodents, are neuroinvasive in humans and can infect primary cultures of human astrocytes and microglia. Infection of the human astrocytic cell line U-373MG by the OC43 strain of human coronavirus caused an upregulation of IL-6, TNF-a, and MCP-1 mRNA expression. This virus also modulated the activity of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 and augmented nitric oxide production in both U-373MG cells and the human microglial cell line CHME-5. Thus, a coronaviral infection of glial cells could lead to the production of inflammatory molecules that have been associated with central nervous system pathologies such as MS.",

The upregulation of IL-6 mRNA expression observed following HCoV infection was described after Theiler's virus infection of astrocytes (Benveniste, 1998 ). The precise role of IL-6 in CNS pathologies remains unclear since it appears to have both pro-and anti-inflammatory properties through the promotion of leukocyte recruitment by induction of chemokine and adhesion molecules or the downregulation of TNF-a expression and the upregulation of soluble TNF-a receptor and IL-1R antagonist expression (Benveniste, 1998) . Given that IL-6 induction following HCoV infection did not abrogate TNF-a induction in our study, this argues that IL-6 does not repress TNF-a induction in astrocytes.
