[1] have reviewed the latest situation and knowledge about a novel coronavirus that has caused an outbreak of a deadly human infectious disease, named as the COVID-19. World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [2] . The authors have summarised many issues concerning the COVID-19 such as the clinical presentation, epidemiology, treatment, prognosis, prevalence, prevention and response to the outbreak [1] . More importantly, while pointing out the lessons learned, they have highlighted the importance of a number of critical issues, particularly the timeliness of providing information about COVID-19, starting with preventative measures such as quarantine of suspected cases and travel restrictions to contain the outbreak, and taking effective measures to stop the spread of misinformation about COVID-19 [1] .",
