A successful and unbiased experimental strategy was developed by Gerber et al. (2013) to screen for TFs induced by blood-borne signals. This method, dubbed synthetic tandem repeat promoter screening (STAR-PROM) involves the construction of a luciferase reporter gene library with tandemly repeated synthetic promoter elements. It relies on the observation that most TF-binding sites exist at a relatively high frequency in random DNA (Reinke et al. 2008; Gerber et al. 2013 ). However, this strategy requires thousands of transfections of individual expression vectors and is therefore extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. To overcome these limitations and render the search for TFs more comprehensive, we developed a barcoded version of STAR-PROM, dubbed BC-STAR-PROM, allowing the single transfection of a pool of >3000 plasmids. Our library encompasses >400,000 base pairs (bp) of synthetic random DNA, a sequence complexity that is expected to be sufficient for the identification of most TFs (Supplemental Fig. S1A,B) . To establish proof of concept, we used BC-STAR-PROM for the search of TFs induced by drugs affecting the polymerization states of actin and tubulin.",

Several studies reported a link between actin or microtubule polymerization dynamics and modifications in gene expression. This regulation can be accomplished through interactions of cytoskeleton components with factors modulating the activity of specific protein kinases (Shtil et al. 1999) or TFs (Rosette and Karin 1995; Sotiropoulos et al. 1999; Rivas et al. 2004) . For example, in response to serum stimulation, the GTPase RhoA is activated and promotes actin polymerization. This results in the depletion of globular actin (G-actin), which binds myocardin-related TFs (MRTF-A and MRTF-B) that serve as coactivators of serum response factor (SRF) (Posern and Treisman 2006) . As a consequence, MRTFs are released into their active form, associate with chromatin-bound SRF, and stimulate the transcription of SRF target genes. In our screen for cytoskeleton-dependent TFs, we used vinblastine (Panda et al. 1996) and paclitaxel (Arnal and Wade 1995) as microtubule depolymerization and polymerization agents, respectively, and latrunculin B (Spector et al. 1989 ) and jasplakinolide (Holzinger 2009 ) as actin depolymerization and polymerization agents, respectively. While the treatment of cells with paclitaxel and latrunculin B failed to yield strongly induced TFs, BC-STAR-PROM showed that jasplakinolide and vinblastine triggered the activation of SRF, NFkB1, and FOS:JUN heterocomplexes. The activation kinetics revealed that SRF was the only immediate early TF stimulated by both actin polymerization and microtubule depolymerization. As suggested by single-cell bioluminescence recordings, such changes in cytoskeleton dynamics during the cell division cycle could also elicit cell-autonomous bursts of SRF-MRTF activation.",

            "text": "We designed a potent screening strategy, dubbed BC-STAR-PROM, for the rapid and unbiased identification of signal-sensing TFs. The approach is based on (1) the high frequency of TF-binding sites in random synthetic DNA, (2) the robust activity of a given TF at promoters containing tandem repeats of its binding site, and (3) the association of the promoters' activities with barcodes in the 3 \u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the corresponding reporter mRNAs. We constructed a BC-STAR-PROM library containing thousands of expression vectors encompassing promoters composed of six tandem repeats of random DNA upstream of a TATA box and a luciferase ORF followed by a short barcode sequence (see Fig. 1A ; Material and Methods). Two sequencing strategies were used to associate the barcodes with the corresponding promoter repeats: SMRT sequencing (Pacific Biosciences), which, owing to high read lengths (mean >6000 nucleotides [nt]), allowed the complete sequencing of a 2.3-kb restriction fragment encompassing both the barcode and the promoter repeats, and Illumina sequencing of restriction fragments, in which barcodes and promoter repeats were brought into proximity by intramolecular ligation (Material and Methods; Supplemental Fig. S2A ). We thus counted 2894 promoters that were associated with 3237 barcodes (Supplemental Fig. S2B ; Supplemental Table  S1 ). We observed the associations of some promoters with multiple barcodes, but, as expected on the basis of statistical grounds, not a single barcode was linked to multiple promoters (Supplemental Table S2 ). The association of some promoters with multiple barcodes served as a quality control, since all barcodes linked to the same promoter yielded a similar pattern in time course experiments (Supplemental Fig. S2C ).",

We conducted four different studies by treating cells with drugs that induce actin stabilization (jasplakinolide), actin depolymerization (latrunculin B), microtubule stabilization (paclitaxel), and microtubule depolymerization (vinblastine). Our laboratory recently discovered that the polymerization state of the actin cytoskeleton in the liver and other tissues undergoes dramatic daily fluctuations, which in turn drive strong oscillations in the activity of MRTFs that serve as coactivators of SRF (Gerber et al. 2013) . If successful, our novel BC-STAR-PROM strategy should reveal several hits for SRF-MRTF after inducing actin polymerization and perhaps additional pathways depending on other TFs. U2OS cells were transfected with the BC-STAR-PROM library, bioluminescence was recorded using a lumicycler to assess relative transfection efficiencies, and dishes with similar luciferase expression (coefficient of variation [CV] <12%) were selected for further experiments. Real-time luminescence profiles showed that these treatments were not very toxic during the 11-h recording time (Supplemental Fig. S3A ). Time series (0-8 h after treatment) were established by preparing RNAs from cells treated with either the drugs or DMSO (vehicle control) (Fig. 1B) . After reverse transcription of RNA, the cDNA barcode regions were PCR-amplified, indexed, and prepared for next-generation sequencing (NGS). The barcoded and indexed samples from an entire experiment (n = 10) were pooled, size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and sequenced using the Illumina rapid mode. For each experimental drug, we generated 35 \u00d7 10 6 to 135 \u00d7 10 6 sequence reads (Supplemental Table  S3 ), which were demultiplexed and trimmed to isolate the 20-nt barcodes (see the Material and Methods). The 3065 barcodes consistently represented in all experiments were ranked according to their relative abundance in the library and annotated starting from the most frequent barcode (Supplemental Table S1 ). The data produced in these experiments represent a functional screening of >400,000 bp of random DNA (3065 68mers, both DNA strands).",

For each barcode, the relative expression at each time point (fold change) was calculated by dividing the read count by the average of the controls (all fold changes are in Supplemental Table S4 ). When ranked on their relative expression, most barcode counts were not influenced by the drug treatments, as expected ( Fig. 2A , top panel; Supplemental Fig. S3A ). However, the number of some barcodes was increased in the drug-treated samples, reflecting an induction of the corresponding expression vectors ( Fig. 2A, bottom panel) . Strongly induced BC-STAR-PROM vectors were observed in cells exposed to jasplakinolide or vinblastine but not in cells treated with latrunculin B and paclitaxel. We therefore focused on the results obtained with jasplakinolide and vinblastine. Comparison of biological replicates for these two drugs substantiated the excellent reproducibility of BC-STAR-PROM ( To validate our results, we isolated promoters of interest from the library pool to test them individually (see the Material and Methods; Supplemental Fig. S4A ). These promoters were cloned into a different vector without the barcode sequence, upstream of a basal promoter driving the expression of a destabilized luciferase (Suter et al. 2011) . The resulting plasmids, carrying the 20 promoters most strongly induced by jasplakinolide and vinblastine in both biological replicates, were individually transfected into U2OS cells to examine whether the bioluminescence recordings after drug treatment faithfully reflected the barcode counts derived from BC-STAR-PROM. As shown in Figure 2B , some promoters were induced by both jasplakinolide and vinblastine. Moreover, among these plasmids, three carried a different barcode but shared the same promoter sequence and showed the same expression pattern (2455-629, 2468-249, and 528-3254) . After transfection, bioluminescence was monitored in real time. Before any drug treatment, we noticed that the luciferase counts for each promoter correlated well with the corresponding number of RNA reads (corrected for the were amplified from a circular ssDNA template by hyperbranched rolling circle amplification. DNA fragments spanning six repeats were gel-purified and cloned upstream of a minimal promoter, thereby generating a STAR-PROM library of \u223c4 \u00d7 10 4 colonies. Barcoded primers (maximum complexity 3.5 \u00d7 10 9 ) were used to amplify a luciferase fragment that was cloned into the STAR-PROM library. (B) Experimental design of TF-binding site screening: U2OS cells were transfected with the entire plasmid library containing >3000 BC-STAR-PROM plasmids. Forty-eight hours later, cells were treated with the respective drugs, and total RNA was collected at different time points. Nontreated cells (time 0) and cells treated with the vehicle (DMSO) served as controls. RNA was reverse-transcribed using a dT 15 VN-tailed primer. Using a three-step nested PCR strategy, the cDNA barcode regions were amplified using cDNA-specific primers with variable flying tails that introduced a 6-nt identifier sequence (index) for each experimental sample in the first reaction and Illumina sequencing primers in the third reaction. Barcode amplicons of an entire experiment (n = 10) were pooled, gel-purified, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq lane using the rapid mode.",

Motifs such as SRF were significantly enriched in the induced promoter, while motifs such as CLOCK-BMAL1 were poorly ranked (Supplemental Fig. S5 ). However, due to the way scores were calculated, this predictive method is limited to motifs involved in an immediate early response. We therefore focused our analysis on the four groups of induced promoters, assuming that promoters showing a similar response to the drugs might share common TF-binding motifs. We scanned both strands of the promoter sequences in each group to identify such putative motifs using the JASPAR database (Mathelier et al. 2014 ) and then used siRNA knockdown strategies to scrutinize the validity of our TF predictions (see Supplemental Fig. S6A for knockdown efficiencies).

As SRF is known to respond to changes in actin dynamics via the recruitment of MRTFs released from G-actin (Sotiropoulos et al. 1999; Posern and Treisman 2006) , we monitored the activity of each individual promoter in U2OS cells depleted for SRF or for MRTF-A + MRTF-B. siRNAs against both SRF and MRTFs abrogated the response of these plasmids to jasplakinolide and vinblastine ( Fig. 3B ; Supplemental  Fig. S6B ). To determine whether vinblastine induction also relied on actin dynamics, we pretreated cells for 2 h before vinblastine treatment with latrunculin B to destabilize actin filaments (Fig. 3F) . As a control, cells were also pretreated with paclitaxel or DMSO and induced 2 h thereafter with jasplakinolide or vinblastine. While actin depolymerization by latrunculin B prevented a response to vinblastine, paclitaxel did not abolish the stimulatory effect of jasplakinolide. This demonstrated that SRF induction by vinblastine required the release of MRTFs from G-actin and probably relied on RhoA activation (Enomoto 1996; Chitaley and Webb 2001) . Although the kinetics of the responses to the two drugs was similar, each promoter displayed a different expression profile with regard to basal level, fold change, and the duration of the activation (Fig. 2C ). These differences were likely caused by sequences surrounding the CArG box, which can recruit TFs other than SRF (Fig. 3A) .",

For plasmids 1844 and 1092 ( Fig. 2C; Supplemental Fig. S6C ), the fold change of induction was already low for jasplakinolide and therefore was not visible for vinblastine (twofold) in the heat map (Fig. 2B ). However, plasmid 2778 displayed a strong response to jasplakinolide (30-fold) but not to vinblastine. Both SRF depletion and MRTF-A + MRTF-B depletion attenuated the response to jasplakinolide dramatically (Fig. 3C; Supplemental Fig. S6C ). Hence, SRF must have been the inducible TF for these plasmids as well. One possible explanation for the failure of plasmid 2778 to respond to vinblastine would be that its promoter sequence also contains a motif for a vinblastine-induced repressor, preventing SRF activation. To test this hypothesis, we pretreated U2OS cells with vinblastine 1 h before jasplakinolide treatment. Indeed, this pretreatment strongly dampened the jasplakinolide-mediated stimulation of plasmid 2778 expression but not that of plasmid 2961 (group 1) (Supplemental Fig. S6F ). Whereas further investigations would be needed to identify this interfering factor and its mode of action, these observations suggest that BC-STAR-PROM can even reveal combinatorial effects of TF motifs.",

Indeed, the response to both drugs was abrogated after siRNA-mediated NFkB1 depletion ( Fig. 3D ; Supplemental Fig. S6D ). Several studies have already shown that jasplakinolide (Kustermans et al. 2005) or vinblastine (Rosette and Karin 1995; Jackman et al. 2009 ) can trigger NFkB activation, but the involved mechanisms are not yet fully understood (Yu and Brown 2015) . Interestingly, knocking down MRTF-A + B, but not SRF, also blunted the induction by jasplakinolide (Supplemental Fig. S6D) . Hence, the induction of NFkB by jasplakinolide required MRTFs as either cofactors or transcriptional activators for NFkB, as described in Yu et al. (2014) . We also showed that promoter 4110 contains binding motifs for NFkB and AP-1 and required both factors for jasplakinolide induction (Supplemental Fig. S6D ).

In contrast, all examined group 4 vectors displayed a delayed response to jasplakinolide (Fig. 2C ). Motif analysis detected an AP-1-binding site in promoter 33 and a CRE element in promoter 2110 and 1099, both of which serve as binding sites for FOS:JUN heterodimers (Chinenov and Kerppola 2001) . Moreover, a composite NFATc1:AP-1-binding site, known to mediate synergistic binding of FOS:JUN and NFATc1 (Macian et al. 2001) , was identified in promoter 1704 (Fig. 3A) . Indeed, depletion of FOS in U2OS cells drastically diminished their response to both drugs but also the basal expression level of the plasmids ( Fig. 3F; Supplemental Fig. S6E ). Vinblastine had indeed been reported to induce AP-1, c-Jun, and ATF2 through the activation of the JNK/AP-1 pathway (Fan et al. 2001) , which is also known to respond to jasplakinolide (Witteck et al. 2003) . The knockdown of FOS did not affect the response of plasmid 1099 to jasplakinolide, suggesting that another TF participated in the induction process. Further investigations would be needed to identify this TF. For the plasmids affected by FOS knockdown, the inductions by both vinblastine and jasplakinolide required the presence of SRF but not MRTFs (Supplemental Fig. S6E ). This is not surprising, as c-Fos transcription is driven by SRF-TCF rather than SRF-MRTF complexes (Zinck et al. 1993) . However, both the fold change and the kinetics of the responses to jasplakinolide and vinblastine were different, indicating that these drugs elicited different mechanisms. To test whether one pathway was upstream of or downstream from the other, we pretreated cells with the antagonists latrunculin B and paclitaxel in order to destabilize the actin cytoskeleton or stabilize the microtubule network, respectively, 2 h prior vinblastine and jasplakinolide treatment (Supplemental Fig. S6G ). Neither of the two pretreatments prevented the action of vinblastine and jasplakinolide on this fourth group of promoters, suggesting that no cross-talk between the actin and tubulin networks was required for the activation of TF complexes containing FOS.",

Cells were grown at low density in 20% FBS (to foster proliferation) and recorded in an LV200 bioluminescence microscope. While cells transfected with the control plasmid displayed a rather smooth luciferase expression profile, plasmid 2961 showed a burst of activation in between two cytokinesis events (Supplemental Fig. S7C ,D; Supplemental Movies 1, 2). This indicated that promoter 2961, which contained SRF-binding motifs, was stimulated by cell-autonomous mechanisms during the cell division cycle. To record a larger number of cells, we used a stable NIH3T3 cell line (dubbed 41-3t3) expressing a single copy of a luciferase transgene driven by a synthetic promoter harboring eight 84-bp tandem repeats with CArG boxes (Gerber et al. 2013) . In this transgene, the normal firefly luciferase was replaced by a destabilized luciferase (Suter et al. 2011) , affording a high temporal resolution. Individual cells were monitored by real-time bioluminescence imaging during 78 h. As indicated by its name, SRF is induced by serum, and we thus had to eliminate serum-confounding effects triggered by exposing the cells to new medium (Supplemental Fig. S7E ). Therefore, we evaluated only recordings obtained 16 h after plating, when the initial response to the medium change had vanished. As shown in Figure 4A , we noticed a recurrent induction of the SRF-luc reporter gene after cell division (Supplemental Movie 3). The number of cells displaying the burst of SRF activity decreased strikingly when cells reached confluency (see Supplemental Movie 4). The bioluminescence traces of >100 individual cells between two cell divisions revealed a major peak of bioluminescence centered at 5-7 h after cytokinesis in a high fraction of cells, and the timing of this SRF activation burst did not depend on the duration of the cell division cycle (Fig. 4B ,C; Supplemental Fig. S7F) . In a small minority of cells, a less pronounced peak centered at \u223c13 h after cytokinesis was also observed ( Fig. 4B; Supplemental Fig. S7F ). 41-3T3 transiently transfected with siRNAs against MRTF-A + B showed almost no response to serum induction during the first 16 h ( Fig. 4D; Supplemental Fig. S7E ), and the cumulative number of cells expressing luciferase in dividing cells per frame for 15 min was reduced by eightfold (Fig. 4D , right panel; Supplemental Movies 5, 6). Hence, the cell cycle-dependent activation of the SRF-dependent promoter required the MRTF pathway. Cell counting performed in parallel revealed that the MRTF-A + B double knockdown had only a modest anti-proliferative effect (Fig. 4E) . We therefore concluded that, during cell cycle progression, endogenous events triggered the release of MRTFs from G-actin, which led to the transcriptional stimulation of SRF target genes. In a few cells, SRF induction preceded cytokinesis (Fig. 4B) , raising the possibility that the activity of SRF might also be induced just before cytokinesis, when actin forms the contractile ring.",

In contrast to the original STAR-PROM procedure, which requires thousands of individual transfections, BC-STAR-PROM involves only a small number of transfections. In addition, it samples \u223c400,000 bp of synthetic random DNA sequences rather than the 57,000 bp covered by the original STAR-PROM method. Therefore, it should reveal even TFs binding to complex DNA motifs. In this report, we established proof of principle for BC-STAR-PROM by studying its response to drugs affecting the dynamics of cellular actin and tubulin networks. Biological replicates with the cytoskeletal drugs jasplakinolide and vinblastine confirmed its excellent reproducibility ( Fig. 2B; Supplemental Fig. S2C ). When focusing on the plasmids strongly induced by vinblastine and jasplakinolide, we were able to identify most of the TFs known to be induced by these two drugs. A major virtue of our strategy is that it affords the monitoring of the TF induction kinetics after drug treatment (Fig. 3G) , which provides information on the involved mechanism. A very rapid induction is likely to reflect an immediate early response, depending on a TF already present in an inactive form in the noninduced state, while a delayed induction favors a scenario in which the TF of interest has to be synthesized before it can elicit the response. It is perhaps surprising that polymerizing and depolymerizing the actin and tubulin cytoskeletons did not affect the activity of more TFs than the ones revealed by BC-STAR-PROM. However, as multiple hits were scored for all of the identified TFs, we feel confident that our screen approached saturation.",

Our study focused only on TFs whose transactivation potential was increased by the drug treatment. The screening for signal-dependent repressors is technically more challenging. Obviously, in such experiments, the time-dependent fold changes depend on the mRNA half-life, and even a complete repression would reduce the barcode read number by only a factor of two for each time interval equivalent to the mRNA half-life. Hence, for the search of repressors, BC-STAR-PROM plasmids encoding extremely short-lived reporter mRNAs should be designed.",

However, our BC-STAR-PROM performed in U2OS did not reveal TEAD-binding sites as cis-acting elements conferring a potent induction by jasplakinolide. Although sequences perfectly matching the TEAD consensus binding sequence were present in many promoters of the BC-STAR-PROM library, these motifs were not enriched in jasplakinolide-responsive promoters. Putative TEADbinding sites were found in addition to CArG boxes and NFkB1-binding sites in the promoters of plasmids 2961, 2999, and 528, whose transcription was induced by jasplakinolide (Supplemental Fig. S8 ). However, in contrast to SRF and NFkB1 depletion, which abrogated the induction by jasplakinolide, the depletion of YAP had little if any effect on this process (Supplemental Fig. S8B,C) . We determined the expression of the endogenous YAP target genes CNN1 and CNN2 to examine whether the Hippo pathway was activated in U2OS cells under the conditions used for BC-STAR-PROM. As depicted in Supplemental Figure S8D , the accumulation of mRNAs encoded by these two genes was increased by merely twofold for CNN1 and threefold for CNN2. Moreover, CNN1 and CNN2 mRNA accumulation could be detected only during the first 2 h after drug treatment. Considering the modest response of the Hippo pathway to jasplakinolide and the bioinformatics algorithms used for the BC-STAR-PROM data mining, it is not surprising that YAP was not detected in our screen.",

            "text": "Endogenous activation of the MRTF-SRF pathway during the cell cycle SRF was the only TF responding to both polymerization of actin and depolymerization of microtubules through the same pathway. Cross-talk between actin and tubulin dynamics is known to occur during the cell division cycle (Akhshi et al. 2014) . In fact, microtubule depolymerization triggers RhoA activation (Chitaley and Webb 2001) , and Rho GTPases have been reported to regulate cell cycle progression at two stages: one at the G1/S transition and the other during cytokinesis (Heng and Koh 2010) . Our real-time bioluminescence recordings of single cells revealed that SRF-dependent promoters were indeed induced via the MRTF pathway in a large fraction of dividing cells \u223c6 h after cytokinesis, which, in NIH3T3 cells, coincides roughly with the G1/S transition. The integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and RhoA activation are required for the G1/S transition (Heng and Koh 2010) , but whether microtubules regulate the activation of RhoA and actin polymerization during G1/S transition is less clear. Nonetheless, the depolymerization of microtubules induces the entry of quiescent cells into S phase, perhaps by provoking actin polymerization (Bershadsky et al. 1996) , and several MRTF/SRF target genes encode regulators of cytoskeleton dynamics and the cell cycle (Esnault et al. 2014) . Indeed, MRTFs have been demonstrated to be required for the precise timing of cell cycle phases (Shaposhnikov et al. 2013) . As activation of the SRF/MRTF pathway can efficiently reset circadian clocks in mammalian cells (Gerber et al. 2013; Esnault et al. 2014) , it is enticing to speculate that this signaling pathway also participates in the coupling of circadian and cell cycle oscillators (Bieler et al. 2014) .",

All knockdown efficiencies were assessed by RT-qPCR using SYBR Green (Invitrogen). Relative cDNA abundances were calculated by the comparative Ct method (\u0394\u0394Ct) (Livak and Schmittgen 2001) using GAPDH cDNA levels for normalization.

In the 20-nt barcode region, only 3 nt (H, D, V, and B) were allowed at each position. This strategy prevented the formation of long homopolymeric stretches and facilitated the identification of sequencing errors at later stages. To minimize the number of promoter plasmids associated with the same barcode inserts, the number of possible barcodes was in large excess over the number of plasmids. As a consequence, some promoters could be linked to more than one barcode, which may serve as a useful control in verifying the correctness of the bioinformatics pipeline. Cloning was conducted by transforming 6 \u00d7 100 \u00b5L of ZYCY10P3S2T competent cells (Thermo Fischer Scientific), resulting in \u223c5000 colonies distributed on six plates.

The treatment of the ligation products with exonucleases (5 U of ExoVII, 100 U of ExoIII; Affymetrix) for 90 min at 37\u00b0C removed linear DNA molecules. Enzymes were inactivated by adding 1 \u00b5L of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and 1 \u00b5L of SDS (20%), DNA circles were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated overnight at \u221220\u00b0C with 2.5 vol of ethanol in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl.

The coupling reaction was incubated at for 2 h room temperature on a rotating wheel (40 rpm), and the beads were immobilized on a magnetic stand. To remove uncoupled DNA, the beads were washed three times for 10 min in 500 \u00b5L of buffer A + 0.5% SDS, three times in buffer A, and once in Taq buffer. Beads were resuspended in 25 \u00b5L of Taq buffer, and the captured DNA was amplified with the primer 5 \u2032 -TCTACTAGTCAT CTTTTTGATGG-3 \u2032 and the appropriate reverse barcode primer. Amplified DNAs were digested with HindIII and NheI, and the promoter fragments were gel-purified and cloned into the destabilized luciferase vector pGL4.24 (Promega). Clones were verified by Sanger sequencing (Fasteris).",

            "text": "Cells were plated in \u00b5-Dishes 35 mm high, ibiTreat (81156 from Ibidi) at a low density (100,000 cells unless otherwise stated) in 2 mL of 20% DMEM, HEPES (without phenol red) (GIBCO), and 200 \u00b5M luciferin. The dish was placed in a 37\u00b0C chamber equilibrated with humidified air containing 5% CO 2 , and timelapse bioluminescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus LV200 workstation (Bioimaging Platform) equipped with a 20\u00d7 objective. For each movie, bioluminescence emission was detected for several consecutive days using an EM-CCD camera (Image EM X2 9100-23B, Hamamatsu), taking images every 15 min and using exposure times of 10 min. The image series were analyzed using ImageJ software (Livak and Schmittgen 2001; Schneider et al. 2012) . Bioluminescence images (512 \u00d7 512 tif stacks of 16 bits) were filtered from noise by taking for each pixel the minimum value between two consecutive acquisitions. For tracing experiments, bright-field images (512 \u00d7 512 pixels, 8-bit stacks) were corrected for uneven illumination by subtracting the background estimated with a median matrix of 8 pixels. A maximum matrix of 1 pixel was subsequently applied to facilitate cell tracking. Cells were tracked using the semiautomated CGE plug-in (Sage et al. 2010) . The traces between two cell divisions, as manifested by cytokinesis, were imported on the bioluminescence images, and the luciferase signals were measured as intensity counts. For counting experiments, luminescence files were treated using the same parameters (contrast/brightness/threshold), and the tool \"analyze particles\" of ImageJ software was used to count luminescent cells for each frame of the movie.",
