            "text": "The Wbroblast-like synoviocyte is a CD13-positive cell-type containing numerous caveolae, both single and interconnected clusters. In unstimulated cells, all single caveolae at the cell surface and the majority of those localized deeper into the cytoplasm were freely accessible from the medium, as judged from electron microscopy of synoviocytes exposed to the membrane impermeable marker Ruthenium Red. Caveolar internalization could be induced by a CD13 antibody or by cholera toxin B subunit (CTB). Thus, in experiments using sequential labeling with Alexa 488-and 594-conjugated CTB, about 50% of CTB-positive caveolae were internalized by 5 min of chase, and these remained inaccessible from the cell surface for periods up to 24 h. No colocalization with an endosomal marker, EEA1, or Lysotracker was observed, indicating that internalized caveolae clusters represent a static compartment. Vimentin was identiWed as the most abundant protein in detergent resistant membranes (DRM's), and by immunogold electron microscopy caveolae were seen in intimate contact with intermediate-size Wlaments. These observations indicate that vimentin-based Wlaments are responsible for the spatio-temporal Wxation of caveolae clusters. RECK, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein acting as a negative regulator of cell surface metalloproteinases, was also localized to the caveolae clusters. We propose that these clusters function as static reservoirs of specialized lipid raft domains where proteins involved in cell-cell interactions, such as CD13, can be sequestered by binding to RECK in a regulatory manner.",

They are particularly abundant in adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and Wbroblasts and reportedly function in a multitude of cellular transport-and signaling processes (Mineo and Anderson 2001; Nichols and Lippincott-Schwartz 2001; Pelkmans and Helenius 2003; Carver and Schnitzer 2003; Hommelgaard et al. 2005; Parton and Simons 2007; Patel et al. 2008) . Caveolae owe the characteristic shape to their main structural proteins, the caveolins (Fra et al. 1995; Drab et al. 2001 ). These are \u00bb22 kDa cholesterol-binding proteins with both the N-and C-terminal ends in the cytoplasm and anchored to the membrane by a central putative hairpin intramembrane domain. About 150 oligomerized caveolin molecules are present in a single caveola (Williams and Lisanti 2004; Pelkmans and Zerial 2005) which has also been estimated to harbor \u00bb20,000 cholesterol molecules and to be relatively enriched in certain sphingoglycolipids and sphingomyelin (Ortegren et al. 2004) . This composition favors the formation of liquid-ordered lipid raft domains, and caveolins and other proteins that localize to caveolae are generally found to be enriched in preparations of detergent resistant membranes (DRM's) (Simons and Ikonen 1997; Anderson 1998) .",

Their mode of functioning at the surface of various types of cells has been intensely studied for several years, but it is still a matter of some controversy whether they are static or dynamic membrane structures. Early on, the term potocytosis was introduced to describe a receptor-mediated endocytosis of folate by caveolae, followed by direct delivery to the cytoplasm and thus bypassing the lysosomes (Anderson et al. 1992 ). However, experiments including FRAP microscopy of cells expressing GFP-caveolin-1 later indicated that caveolae remain at the cell surface as immobile units for long periods of time (Thomsen et al. 2002) . More recently, TIR-FM experiments have revealed two possible modes of dynamic caveolar functioning in HeLa cells: one consisting of rapid Wssion-fusion cycles taking place in close vicinity of the plasma membrane (termed kiss-and-run recycling), and another, microtubule-dependent long-range cytoplasmic transport (Pelkmans and Zerial 2005) . Furthermore, caveolar mobility and long-range transport to caveosomes could be dramatically increased by simian virus 40 (SV40) (Tagawa et al. 2005) , a virus known to use caveolae for cell entry (Anderson et al. 1996) . In either mode, however, the caveolae function as Wxed entities, i.e., unlike clathrin-and COP-mediated vesicular transport, where coat molecules undergo cycles of assembly and disassembly.",

CD13 is an ectopeptidase that has been implicated in the control of growth and diVerentiation of many cellular systems, and it is involved in processing a number of peptide hormones, including angiotensins, met-enkephalin, and somatostatin (Riemann et al. 1999 ).

Furthermore, human coronavirus 229E exploits CD13 as a receptor and causes a redistribution of the peptidase from the surface to caveolae in Wbroblasts (Nomura et al. 2004) , and recently CD13 was reported to be regulated by the reversion-inducing cysteinerich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) by a modulation of its surface expression (Miki et al. 2007 ).",

We found that all single caveolae and most but not all of the caveolae clusters are normally freely accessible. About 50% of all caveolae were capable of internalizing CTB within 5 min of chase, but once internalized, the toxin remained in the closed caveolae for periods up to 24 h, as judged by lack of colocalization with markers for endosomes (EEA1) and lysosomes (lysotracker). The synoviocyte caveolae clusters were strongly associated with vimentin-based intermediate Wlaments, and we propose that association with this cytoskeleton without molecular motors for vesicle traYcking attached, may explain the static behavior of caveolae in synoviocytes and other cell types.

This was the case both for the single caveolae positioned close to the surface, as well as the clusters of interconnected caveolae typically seen deeper within the cell. However, among the many sections examined, unlabeled caveolae were only occasionally detected, indicating their ability to seal oV from the surface (Fig. 1a) . These unlabeled caveolae were most often of the clustered type and were always seen at some distance from the cell surface (Fig. 1b, c) . In contrast, single caveolae seen in direct contact with the plasma membrane were always stained by Ruthenium Red, indicating a permanent access to the extracellular medium for this caveolar subpopulation.

Caveolar dynamics studied with CTB As shown in Fig. 3 , when Wxed synoviocytes were incubated with Xuorescent CTB, the toxin widely colocalized with caveolin, conWrming that binding at the cell surface in synoviocytes preferentially takes place in single caveolae or caveolae clusters. To study the dynamics of caveolae Fig. 2 Internalization of CD13. Synoviocytes were labeled with CD13 antibodies. After washing, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the absence or presence of CTB. CD13 at the surface was then visualized by labeling with an Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (a, d). After cell permeabilization with saponin, total (internalized and surface-localized) CD13 was detected by a second Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody (b, e). c and f The merged images. In the absence of CTB, few distinct punctae were only labeled after cell permeabilisation, indicating internalization of CD13. Addition of CTB greatly increased internalization internalization, we performed sequential double color labeling experiments with Alexa 488-and Alexa 594-conjugated CTB (Fig. 4a) . Colocalization of the two Xuorophores was close to 90% when they were added simultaneously, but within 5 min of \"chase\" period between the two additions of toxin, colocalization decreased to about 45%, indicating the induction of a rapid internalization of about half the surface-bound CTB. During chase periods for up to 3 h, the degree of colocalization only slowly decreased further, to just under 30%. This degree of colocalization was observed even by 24 h of chase, indicating that the internalized CTB remains stable over a long period of time (Fig. 4b) . Regardless of the chase time, the labeling representing internalized CTB was localized in punctae mainly centered around the nucleus, whereas the immobile, colocalized fraction was mainly seen at the periphery of the cell, in particular along the cell protrusions (Fig. 4a) . This distribution agrees well with the Ruthenium Red experiments (Fig. 1) , and implies the existence of an internalization-competent subpopulation of caveolae, consisting mainly of the caveolae clusters, and an immobile fraction of single caveolae in close proximity to the cell surface.",

To examine if some of the internalized CTB was transported to the endosomal system, a double labeling with CTB and EEA1, a marker for early endosomes (Mu et al. 1995) , was performed, but as shown in Fig. 5 , no colocalization between the two was detected after 30 min. Similarly, a double labeling with CTB and the lysosomal marker Lysotracker was performed, but again, no colocalization was observed after 3 h (Fig. 5) .

            "text": "Clearly, the data obtained in the present work regarding further membrane transport of internalized CTB in synoviocytes do not Wt well with the above dynamic concept of the caveosome as a major traYcking hub. The failure to detect a convincing colocalization with the endosomal marker EEA1 after 30 min or Lysotracker after 3 h of internalization strongly argues against a major pathway leading to the acidifying organelles. In fact, the persistence of the characteristic punctate labeling pattern throughout the timecourse of the incubation suggests that most if not all internalized CTB in synoviocytes remains within the closed caveolar system. A possible explanation for this observed stability is the strong association with the intermediate Wlament system, as evidenced by the relative abundance of Fig. 7 Visualization of cytoskeletal Wlaments in synoviocytes. After Wxation and permeabilization, synoviocytes were labeled with antibodies to either vimentin or a-tubulin followed by Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies. For visualization of actin Wlaments, the permeabilized cells were labeled with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin. Each cytoskeletal system has its characteristic organization in synoviocytes vimentin in synoviocyte DRM's, as well as by immunogold electron microscopy. Association between caveolae and intermediate Wlaments have previously been described for transmigrating endothelial cells (Santilman et al. 2007 ), but otherwise the action of the microWlaments has been implicated in caveolar endocytosis. Thus, SV40 binding in HeLa cells induced a transient break down of existing actin stress Wbers and a recruitment of actin to virus-loaded caveolae to initiate formation of new actin Wbers (Pelkmans et al. 2002) . This ligand-triggered rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton has been proposed to eliminate the spatial restrictions on caveolar dynamics and enable caveolae to switch from local kiss-and-run recycling to committed, long-range, microtubule-dependent internalization to intracellular organelles (Tagawa et al. 2005) . The traYcking/ functioning of caveolae in a given cell type therefore seems to depend upon their cytoskeletal interactions. Thus, in synoviocytes, where association with intermediate Wlaments dominates, we Wnd it doubtful if the caveolae clusters that internalize CTB also engage in bona Wde membrane traYcking from the surface to the cell interior. Conceivably, the internalization process may consist merely of a caveolar closure, taking place either at the cell surface or maybe somewhere within a pleiomorphic caveolae cluster. Furthermore, as judged by the experiments with Ruthenium Red, closure is a rare event in cells not challenged by pathogens and thus may not be an important part of normal caveolar functioning. This may be exampliWed by the dual localization of CD13, partly at \"Xat\" areas of the plasma membrane and partly in caveolae. By sequestering from the former to the latter compartment by regulated association with the caveolar RECK protein (Miki et al. 2007 ), CD13 (and membrane proteinases of the MMP family) will be prevented from participating in cell-cell interactions and contact with the extracellular matrix regardless whether the caveolae are open or not. Along these lines, future work should aim to clarify which of the many other biological functions ascribed to caveolae, including signaling, lipid Fig. 8 Surface localization of RECK. After Wxation, synoviocytes were labeled with an antibody to RECK, followed by an Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody. After washing, the cells were subsequently labeled with an antibody to CD13, followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Alternatively, the cells were labeled with Alexa 488-conjugated CTB after the labeling for RECK. Unlike the widespread localization of CD13, RECK labeling was conWned to the central part of the cell. RECK partially colocalized with CTB, indicating that it is also present in caveolae regulation/storage and mechanosensing (Parton and Simons 2007 ) that involve true internalization.",
