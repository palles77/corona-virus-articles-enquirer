            "text": "Herpes simplex virus; Herpes simplex hepatitis; 19F Nuclear magnetic resonance; Carbon tetrachloride hepatitis Introduction A number of antiviral drugs exhibit marked accumulation in herpes simplex virus (HSV) infected cells in vitro. The virus induced enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) phosphorylates these drugs to the monophosphate, which is converted to the diand the triphosphate by cellular enzymes. Such a mechanism has been shown to lead to the intracellular accumulation of phosphorylated derivatives of acyclovir (Furman, 1981) , 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine (DHPG) (Smee, 1985) , trifluorothymidine (TFT) (Fischer, 1983) and other agents (Price, 1986 ). TFT contains 3 fluorine atoms which comprise approximately 19% of its molecular weight. Since the naturally occurring isotope, \"F, has a nuclear spin of 112, it is possible that sufficient concentrations of TFT could be detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. If it could be shown that TFT was concentrated in vivo in the tissues of HSV-2 infected animals as it is in vitro, it is possible that the excess accumulation could be detected noninvasively by \"F NMR spectroscopy.",

In this model, maximal HSV-2 titers are present in the liver between days 3 and 5, and mice generally died from day 4-6 from this high inoculum. Titers of HVM A59 are also maximal on days 3-5, but mice were less ill than when infected with HSV-2. Three days after infection, mice were anesthetized with a 3: 1 mixture of 100 mgiml ketamine HC1:20 mg/ml Xylazine at a dose of 0.2 ml/kg. The jugular vein was surgically exposed, and mice were injected intravenously with 100 or 160 mgikg of TFI in the appropriate volume of a 20 mg/ml solution in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) pH 7.4. We chose jugular venous injection because we could assure the accuracy of the intravenous injection. Mice were sacrificed at 45 min, 2, 2.5 and 3.5 h after I.V. injection of TFT. The livers were immediately excised and frozen at -70\u00b0C until they could be studied. For viral titration and measurement of TIT, 1.5 ml of PBS was mixed with 1 g of liver and the mixture homogenized (10 strokes using a Pyrex Ten Broeck tissue grinder), followed by sonication x 4 for 30 s in a Fisher 300 sonic dismembrator at a relative output of 0.55; 0.8 ml of the liver homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of methanol, vortexed extensively and then centrifuged at 15000 X g for 15 min. The supernatant was analyzed by HPLC for TFI and the results expressed per gram of liver after correction for dilution. Prior to sonication, 0.5 ml of the liver homogenate was serially diluted in serum free tissue culture media and titrated in triplicate in Vero cells as previously described (Rand, 1986) . In some experiments the clarified supernatant that had been mixed with methanol as described above was placed in a 5 mm NMR tube and 19F content measured by NMR spectroscopy (see below). In other experiments the entire liver was excised, and placed in a 12 mm NMR tube and the 19F directly analyzed by NMR spectroscopy (described below).",

Twenty-four hours after i.p. injection of 0.2 ml/kg CC& in olive oil, blood was collected again, and both sets were analyzed for Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN). For ALT, 2 ~1 serum was analyzed in duplicate with a Technicon RA 1000 and for BUN 10 ~1 duplicate samples were analyzed with a Beckman Astra 8.

At a dose of 0.2 ml/kg CC& in olive oil injected i.p., overwhelming hepatic necrosis resulted a day later, with ALT levels in blood in the range of 1800&28000 W/ml (see Table 2 ). As shown by the BUN, there was no significant alteration in renal function.

Preliminary experiments were then carried out to determine the average ALT levels of HSV-2 infected mice on day 3 at the time higher levels of TFT were found in the liver. On day 3 following i.p. injection with 4-6 X lo6 pfu HSV-2, 4 mice had an ALT mean * SD of 3554 2 781 IUiml blood. A dose response curve of Ccl, hepatitis showed that between 0.015-0.02 ml/kg Ccl4 would lead to ALT levels of 500-5000 IU/ml blood 24 h later. Therefore, Ccl, was used at a dose of 0.02 ml/kg. Despite the preliminary data, the ALT levels measured in the blood of the 12 CC& treated mice actually given TFT was 18950 ? 7526 (Table 2 ). Fig. 1 shows that there was essentially no difference in blood levels of TFT at 45 min after i.v. injection, and no measurable blood levels of TFT at 2 h among any of the groups. HSV-2 infected mice had significantly higher levels of TFT in their livers at both 2 and 3.5 h after i.v. injection of TFT, whether compared with uninfected or Ccl, treated mice. If TFT levels in liver were due to accumulation in HSV infected liver cells, then the higher the HSV titer/g liver, the higher the TFT level should be. The relationship between HSV-2 pfu/g liver and TFT concentration/g liver among infected mice is illustrated in 2 separate experiments in Fig. 2 . The first experiment (o's) shows the relationship between HSV-2 titer in pfuig liver and TFT concentration/g liver for the 9 HSV-2 infected mice studied at 2 h after i.v. injection of TFT shown in Fig. 1 . Linear regression showed a correlation coefficient of r = 0.72, P co.05 in this experiment (o's) and r = 0.99, P < 0.05 in the other (M'S). A similar relationship was also observed among infected mice studied at 3.5 h after receiving Blood urea nitrogen and serum alanine aminotransferase levels in carbon tetrachloride and herpes simplex virus-2 treated CBA/J mice.

( , 1986 and Saito et al. (1982 Saito et al. ( , 1984 using 14C labeled 2' fluoro-5methyl-l-@o-arabinosyluracil (FMAU) were able to show specific concentration of the drug in the optic nerve and chiasm of rats after intraocular inoculation of HSV-1. However, there was also non-specific accumulation of FMAU in the choroid plexus and the cells lining the ventricular walls. Biron et al. (1982) studied 14C labeled acyclovir, which has been shown to accumulate intracellularly in HSV infected cells in vitro (Furman, 1981) . Following S.C. injection, acyclovir levels were similar in all HSV infected and uninfected tissues studied, i.e. liver, kidney, spleen, lung, blood and brain. Price et al. (1986) were also unable to demonstrate any selective accumulation of acyclovir in HSV infected tissues in vivo. It seems difficult to reconcile the lack of accumulation of acyclovir in HSV infected tissues, with our observation of high levels of TFT in livers from HSV-2 infected mice, since both compounds are phosphorylated by the HSV TK and do accumulate in tissue culture. Recently, Smee et al. showed that while acyclovir accumulated in the form of phosphorylated intermediates in HSV infected cells in vitro, it was also rapidly degraded back to acyclovir, and diffused out of the cell (Smee et al., 1985) . In contrast, DHPG also accumulated in a similar manner, but did not hydrolyze back to the parent compound as readily. Thus, even related drugs which utilize the same basic steps in their mechanism of action can behave quite differently biologically. Furthermore, we used i.v. injection of TFT via the jugular vein, which would result in extremely high blood levels initially, with a rapid fall off, as we observed,",

In summary, highly elevated levels of TFT were observed in livers of HSV-2 infected mice compared with either uninfected mice, mice infected with MHV-A59 or Ccl4 treated mice. There was good correlation between TFT levels in liver tissue and HSV-2 titers in the same tissues. Neither altered pharmacokinetics, nor non-specific liver damage could account for the observed drug accumulation. NMR spectroscopy has the sensitivity to detect high levels of TFT readily, and thus offers a potentially non-invasive method for the diagnosis of visceral HSV infection. Because TFT does not readily cross the blood brain barrier, this methodology may not be directly applicable to the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis. However, visceral infection particularly involving the liver by HSV-2 is well described in immunocompromised (Berglin, 1982; Taylor, 1981; Walker, 1981; Elliott, 1980; Holdsworth, 1976) , as well as non-immunocompromised patients (Diaz Gomez, 1975; Anuras, 1976; Connor, 1979; Eron, 1976; Manoux, 1983; Joseph, 1974; De Berardinis, 1983 ). In addition, neonates with disseminated HSV-2 infection may not have clinically obvious skin vesicles, oral ulcers or keratitis (Moedy, 1981) , and still have liver involvement. Studies of TFT accumulation needed before clinical application can be tested.",
