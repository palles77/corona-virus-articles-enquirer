A recently described systemic coronavirus infection appears to be a variant of the ferret enteric coronavirus and is currently termed \"ferret infectious peritonitis.\" Disseminated immunopathologic myositis, aplastic anemia/bone marrow aplasia, acute hemorrhagic syndrome, and oral ulcerations are also described, although the exact etiologies for these diseases have yet to be determined. There appears to be at least 2 important amino acid metabolism deficiencies in ferrets: hindlimb weakness in older ferrets (L-carnitine) and cysteine urolithiasis. Ferrets have recently been found to be susceptible to H1N1 influenza, so knowledge regarding this zoonotic disease is essential for veterinarians working with these animals. A novel Mycoplasma spp. has also recently been identified in ferrets with chronic respiratory problems that originated from one breeding colony. Because these diseases are still being investigated, practitioners who treat a ferret patient exhibiting clinical signs consistent with any of the conditions mentioned are encouraged to contact people who are knowledgeable of that particular illness.",

In the past 10 years, there has been an increase in the number of ferrets available in pet stores within the United States. Most pet stores obtain their ferret stock from one commercial breeder, although there are other commercial breeders and small, individual breeders who supply the retail market. Most of the diseases presented in this article are being diagnosed in ferrets from different sources, although in the pet trade different shipments may be mixed. Ferret suppliers have established a trend to neuter/spay and descent their ferrets at 3 to 4 weeks of age. There are no published reports on the implications of surgery at that age on the immune system and/or disease exposure in ferrets; however, performing surgery on these animals at this young age does appear to have an effect on growth and development (e.g., adrenal gland disease). Regardless of any negative health effects early surgery may have on the ferret, this practice will likely continue because of consumer demand.",

FECV is the cause of epizootic catarrhal enteritis. Lesions associated with FECV are only found in the gastrointestinal tract, whereas the virus may be isolated from the saliva, feces, and enterocytes. Feline coronavirus is responsible for a feline enteric self-limiting disease, and the mutated form is responsible for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). The agent responsible for the \"FIP-like\" disease in ferrets appears to be a variant of the FECV virus and is being called ferret systemic coronavirus (FSCV). Gross, histological, and immunohistochemical features of FSCV are identical to FIP. [1] [2] [3] Clinical signs of FECV include weight loss (in some cases, the loss of body weight may be severe), anorexia, palpable intraabdominal mass or masses, lethargy, vomiting, splenomegaly, dehydration, bruxism, renomegaly, sneezing/nasal discharge, systolic heart murmur, urine discoloration, dyspnea, peripheral lymphadenomegaly, rectal mucosa erythema, and/or rectal prolapse. Central nervous system (CNS) signs are observed in some ferrets diagnosed with FECV and include acute or progressive hindlimb paresis or paraparesis, ataxia, seizures, abnormal posture, opisthotonus, abnormal gait, and proprioceptive deficits.

FSCV resembles the \"dry form\" of FIP, with widespread nodular foci on serosal surfaces and within the parenchyma of thoracic and abdominal viscera. There is also nodular enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes. Clinically, some practitioners have reported an effusion in the body cavity of their patients that resembles the \"wet form\" of FIP, but this has not been a common condition associated with this disease in ferrets. Designating \"wet\" or \"dry\" forms is somewhat arbitrary, because many cats exhibit lesions consistent with both forms during the course of the illness; it is likely that this is also occurring in ferrets. As more cases of FSCV are diagnosed, more effusive \"wet\" forms of the disease may be documented.",

In conclusion, the relatively recent recognition of FSCV in pet ferrets suggests a recent mutation or shift in the FECV, which has resulted in the development of a systemic disease.

No pathogen has been isolated in any of the confirmed ferret DIM cases by bacterial or viral cultures, EM, immunohistochemistry, or polymerase chain reaction testing for a wide variety of known pathogens. A vaccine from a sole manufacturer is the only known common connection between animals diagnosed with DIM. This vaccine is no longer available; therefore, it is unknown if this syndrome will continue. However, the author has seen at least one confirmed DIM case (2009) in which the ferret did not receive the aforementioned vaccine; consequently, there may be other disease triggers for DIM. In one clinical investigation using the canine castration vaccine, this myofasciitis syndrome was reproduced in the entire group of ferrets, suggesting that DIM may be an immunological response to an inflammatory stimulation. 4 Cytokines in ferrets have recently been studied and found to be similar in structure and function to those of other carnivores. 6 The ferret immune system, for the most part, functions in a similar manner to other animals; therefore, future DIM investigations should focus on the immune system rather than trying to identify an infectious etiology, based on similar diseases of dogs and cats.",

Ferrets that present with AAMA present with a history of lethargy and anorexia and, when examined, have pale to white mucus membranes (Fig 2) . A few patients have been determined to have moderate splenomegaly, but other physical parameters that can be assessed through Emerging Ferret Diseases external examination appear normal. Packed cell volumes of these animals are generally less than 10%, with bone marrow aspirates being diagnosed as erythrocytic aplasia. AAMA ferrets often have normal white blood cell counts and plasma chemistry parameters. Although transfusions are provided to these patients, erythropoietin therapy is usually ineffective. High doses of corticosteroids have been attempted to rule out an immune-mediated component to this disease process, but do not appear to have a beneficial effect in reducing any of the adverse physical conditions associated with AAMA. The underlying etiology of AAMA in ferrets is currently unknown. Ultimately, compiling case information and full necropsy examinations on patients diagnosed with this disease will be necessary to aid in the pathophysiologic investigation.

One syndrome is cysteine metabolism, which results in cysteine urolithiasis. Ferrets that form cysteine uroliths have all been fed novel protein diets. Abnormalities with L-carnitine metabolism are being linked to skeletal muscle weakness in older ferrets, particularly in the hindlegs. Supplementation with L-carnitine has ameliorated the most severe clinical signs, but further characterization of this syndrome is necessary. Dr. Michelle Hawkins is working on various genetic disease conditions in ferrets. Ferret urolithiasis analyses are currently being performed at the University of California-Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine (Davis, CA USA).",

Influenza A virus was detected in sections of formalin-fixed lung by immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. A field investigation of the premises and analysis of additional samples led to the confirmation and characterization of an influenza virus with high homology to contemporary reassortant H1N1 swine influenza viruses. Although ferrets have been used extensively to investigate the virulence and transmissibility of avian, human, and swine influenza virus strains and test commercial vaccine effectiveness, naturally occurring outbreaks of swine influenza had not previously been documented in ferrets. As human influenza cases continue, veterinary practitioners will likely diagnose more ferrets with this disease. It is unknown at this time if an infected ferret can transmit H1N1 influenza to humans. People who have routine contact with ferrets should receive influenza vaccinations. 8",

The abnormal lesions may appear as small ulcers in the oral cavity, particularly on the hard palate and gums (Fig 4A) . Larger ulcers are frequently apparent on the mucosa of the cheeks or lips (Fig 4B) . Currently, veterinarians are encouraged to take a swab of the affected oral area for viral isolation or collect a biopsy sample to determine a possible etiology. For severe ulcers (Fig 4C) , topical lidocaine gel 1% (Xylocain Topical; Astra Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE USA), parenteral analgesics, antibiotics (e.g., to con- trol opportunistic bacterial infections), and a ferret \"critical care\" diet can be used to keep the ferret comfortable while the ulcers heal.

Conventional diagnostic testing has not provided a definitive diagnosis for this disease condition. Diagnostic tests used to test affected ferrets included bronchiolar lavage (e.g., cytology, aerobic, anaerobic culture), radiographs, endoscopy, heartworm antigen detection, echocardiography, and na-sal/tonsil swabs for bacterial/fungal isolation. In addition, a variety of treatment protocols were also tested in these animals, including antihistamines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antibiotics, bronchodilators, and decongestants. However, most of the affected ferrets had no resolution of their clinical signs, despite treatments. The coughing episodes were harsh, paroxysmal, and sometimes productive.",

Airway epithelial cells appeared attenuated, exfoliated, or eroded. Lumina occasionally contained accumulations of lymphocytes, neutrophils, or necrotic cellular debris. Remaining epithelial cells were denuded of cilia and showed intranuclear edema. There was some mild perivascular lymphoid cuffing. No inclusions or syncytia were observed by the pathologist. Multifocal lipid pneumonia was noted in the parenchyma beneath the capsule or adjacent to the lymphoid nodules. The pulmonary parenchyma was diffusely edematous and congested. All other tissues appeared normal. The diagnosis was severe, nonsuppurative bronchitis, with lesions most closely resembling those of chronic murine pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pulmonis in rats.
