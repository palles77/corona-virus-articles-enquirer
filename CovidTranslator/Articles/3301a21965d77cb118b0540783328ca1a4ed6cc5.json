            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), an emerging animal coronavirus causing enteric disease in pigs, belongs to the newly identified Deltacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family. Although extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the regulation of interferon (IFN) responses by alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and gammacoronaviruses, little is known about this process during deltacoronavirus infection. In this study, we found that PDCoV infection fails to induce, and even remarkably inhibits, Sendai virus-or poly(I: C)-induced IFN-\u03b2 production by impeding the activation of transcription factors NF-\u03baB and IRF3. We also found that PDCoV infection significantly suppresses the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulated by IRF3 or its upstream molecules (RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, TBK1, IKK\u03b5) in the RIG-I signaling pathway, but does not counteract its activation by the constitutively active mutant of IRF3 (IRF3-5D). Taken together, our results demonstrate that PDCoV infection suppresses RIG-I-mediated IFN signaling pathway, providing a better understanding of the PDCoV immune evasion strategy.",

Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus mainly infect mammals and Gammacoronavirus generally infects birds (Chan et al., 2013) , while Deltacoronavirus can be detected in both mammals and birds. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first described in 2012 during a study to identify new coronaviruses in mammals and birds in Hong Kong, China (Woo et al., 2009; Woo et al., 2012) . In early 2014, an outbreak of PDCoV was announced in some pig farms in the United States , and this novel porcine coronavirus has been demonstrated in at least 18 U. S. states (Marthaler et al., 2014a; Marthaler et al., 2014b; Thachil et al., 2015) . Subsequently, the detection of PDCoV was also reported in fecal samples from piglets with diarrhea in Korea, Canada, and mainland China (Dong et al., 2015; Lee and Lee, 2014; Song et al., 2015) . More recently, several groups have demonstrated that PDCoV can cause severe clinical diarrhea and intestinal pathological damage in roughly 10-day-old gnotobiotic and conventional piglets Jung et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015) adding to the increasing concern regarding the epidemiology, evolution, pathogenesis, and immunology of this emerging coronavirus.",

After recognition, RIG-I and/or MDA5 interact with the IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1, also known as MAVS/VISA/Cardif) via the caspase-recruiting domain (CARD)-like domain to activate the downstream \u03baB kinase (IKK)-related kinases, such as TANK-binding kinase 1 and IKK\u03b5, leading to the activation of interferon regulation factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB).",

The molecular mechanisms of IFN antagonism have been extensively studied for alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and gammacoronaviruses (Perlman and Netland, 2009) . For example, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus, inhibits dsRNA-induced IFN-\u03b2 production by blockading the RIG-I-mediated pathway (Cao et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016) . Additionally, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), two representative members of the Betacoronavirus genus, interfere with the IFN response in various ways (Roth-Cross et al., 2007; Totura and Baric, 2012; Zhou and Perlman, 2007) , and at least eight proteins encoded by SARS-CoV have been identified as IFN antagonists (Devaraj et al., 2007; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007; Siu et al., 2009; Wathelet et al., 2007) . The infectious bronchitis virus, a member of the Gammacoronavirus genus, induces a delayed activation of the IFN response (Kint et al., 2015) . As a new member of coronavirus family, however, whether or not deltacoronaviruses antagonize IFN responses and, if they do, the details of this process are unclear.",

To this end, LLC-PK1 cells were infected with PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and the CPEs were examined daily for up to three days. The infected cells were monitored by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) using a monoclonal antibody against PDCoV N protein at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 h post-infection (hpi). As shown in Fig. 1A , only a small portion of cells were infected by 12 hpi, nearly all of the cells were PDCoV-positive at 18 hpi, and no cell detachment was observed at 24 hpi. The number of infected cells deceased rapidly up to 30 hpi, and obvious CPEs were observed along with serious cytopathy and a large number of detached cells at 36 hpi. A onestep growth curve for PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 in LLC-PK1 cells was also generated using TCID 50 assays. As shown in Fig. 1B , virus titers presented a gradually upward tendency as the infection progressed, and at 24 hpi they reached a titer of 10 7.2 TCID 50 /mL. Together, these results show that PDCoV infection in LLC-PK1 cells achieves a high infection rate and titer without cell exfoliation at 24 hpi; thus, this time point was selected as the optimal time point for subsequent immunological studies.",

To explore if PDCoV antagonizes IFN-\u03b2 production, the IFN-\u03b2 promoter luciferase reporter system was used to analyze IFN-\u03b2 expression after PDCoV infection. To this end, LLC-PK1 cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids IFN-\u03b2-Luc and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK, followed by mock-infection or infection with PDCoV at a MOI of 0.01. After 24 h of PDCoV infection, the cell lysates were harvested and the IFN-\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase activity was measured. The mock-infected cells were stimulated with 20 hemagglutinating activity units/well of SeV or 0.5 \u03bcg/well of poly(I:C), respectively, as positive controls to test whether or not LLC-PK1 cells are able to recognize SeV or poly(I:C) and activate IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in response. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, IFN-\u03b2 promoter-driven luciferase activity was barely detectable in PDCoV-infected cells compared with the strong reporter signal in SeV-infected or poly(I:C)-transfected cells, indicating that PDCoV infection failed to activate IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity.",

Previous studies have shown that other coronaviruses, including alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and gammacoronaviruses, can suppresses IFN\u03b2 production by blocking the activation of transcription factor IRF3 (Perlman and Netland, 2009) . In this study, we demonstarted that PDCoV infection also blocks IRF3 activation. It is possible that blockade of IRF3 activation is a common strategey utilized by coronaviruses to antagonize IFN-\u03b2 production. In addition, multiple proteins encoded by coronaviruses have been identified as IFN antagonists (Roth-Cross et al., 2007; Totura and Baric, 2012) . Interestingly, different mechanisms are used by some homologous proteins of different coronaviruses. For example, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of PEDV antagonizes IFN production by sequestering the interaction between IRF3 and TBK1 (Ding et al., 2014) ; MHV A59 N protein antagonizes IFN activity by interfering with the RNase L activity associated with the induction of 2\u2032 \u00c05\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (Ye et al., 2007) ; SARS-CoV N protein blocks a very early step in IFN production, probably at the RNA-sensor recognition step (Lu et al., 2011) . PDCoV also encodes the nucleocapsid protein, and whether PDCoV N protein antagonize IFN activity and what mechanisms are used by PDCoV N protein are very interesting and these issues are currently under investigation in Fig. 3 .

Mechanistically, PDCoV infection suppresses IFN-\u03b2 production by blocking the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NK-\u03baB. To our knowledge, PDCoV is currently the only isolated deltacoronavirus able to be propagated in a cell culture system; thus, it is an important model for studying the interaction between deltacoronaviruses and the innate immune system. Our data provide a novel insight into the immune evasion strategy of PDCoV. Future studies to further identify the PDCoV-encoded IFN antagonists and to understand the mechanism of action of each antagonist could yield novel therapeutic targets and more effective vaccines.",

At 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 h post-infection (hpi), the cells were fixed and incubated with a monoclonal antibody against PDCoV N protein (green). The nuclei of cells were stained with DAPI (blue). Fluorescent images were acquired with a confocal laser scanning microscope and representative images are shown here. (B) The growth curve of PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 in LLC-PK1 cells. LLC-PK1 cells were infected with PDCoV at a MOI of 0.01 and were collected at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, or 36 hpi for the determination of virus titers via TCID 50 assays. The mean titers and standard deviations were calculated from three independent experiments.

Fig. 4(A)-C, overexpression of any molecule of the RIG-I signaling pathway induced a significant activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter in mock-infected cells. Interestingly, the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter induced by IRF3 and its upstream molecules (RIG-I/RIG-IN, MDA-5, IPS-1, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5) was blocked by PDCoV infection",

(A, B) LLC-PK1 cells were co-transfected with IFN-\u03b2-Luc and pRL-TK for 12 h, followed by PDCoV infection (MOI \u00bc 0.01). At 24 hpi, cells were collected for a dual-luciferase assay as described in the Materials and Methods. The results are shown here as the fold induction of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity. Cells infected with SeV (A) or transfected with poly(I:C) (B) were used as positive controls. (C, D) LLC-PK1 cells were co-transfected with IFN-\u03b2-Luc and pRL-TK for 12 h and then mock-infected or infected with PDCoV at different MOIs (1, 0.1, and 0.01). At 12 hpi, the cells were mock-infected or infected with SeV for an additional 12 h (C) or transfected with or without poly (I:C) for an additional 24 h (D), and then subjected to a dual-luciferase assay. The results are shown here as the fold induction of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity. All data are presented as means 7 SD of three independent experiments (*p o 0.05 and **p o 0.01).",
