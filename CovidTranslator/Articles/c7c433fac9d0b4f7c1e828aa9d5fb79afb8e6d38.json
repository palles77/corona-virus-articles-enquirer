An appropriate cell line allows homologous recombination between the transgene and backbone plasmids and then supports synthesis of replication-defective adenovirus particles. It is the ability to mediate homologous recombination that allows assembly of the desired vector, but this ability also can lead to unintended structural changes. Thus it is crucial to select a vector clone that is fully characterized and has the intended structure.

One important discussion centered on the accuracy of adenovirus vector titers in terms of both total particle and infectious particle titers [25] . Since toxic vector doses are just above doses w^ith potential therapeutic effect, there v^as particular concern over lack of accuracy and comparability between titers determined for different product lots and between different clinical trials.

An Adenovirus Reference Materials Working Group (ARMWG) was formed under the auspices of the Williamsburg Bioprocessing Foundation (WBF), and an WBP/FDA partnership agreement was formulated that allowed participation of FDA staff in development of a reference stock of wild-type adenovirus type 5 which can be used to calibrate assays for particle number and infectivity.

At early stages of product development, certificates of analysis (CoA) for many raw materials such as buffers, and basic tissue culture components should be part of the documentation demonstrating that these reagents are pure and free of adventitious agents. These CoAs should be kept in the manufacturer's records and sample CoAs should be submitted to the agency.

As an example, current techniques for adenovirus vector production require mammalian cell substrates. Raw materials include a source of serum, usually fetal bovine serum (FBS), and enzymes such as porcine trypsin for cell culture. These reagents can be contaminated with adventitious virus. Trypsin has been identified as a potential source of porcine parvovirus while FBS can harbor several adventitious viruses. Therefore, FBS and porcine trypsin should come only from sources where appropriate testing is conducted and documented in a CoA. A manufacturer of adenovirus vectors should retain all such CoAs and submit sample copies to FDA.

It is sometimes referred to as a vector seed stock. Table III gives a summary of the types of characterization recommended by the FDA. Safety testing for a master virus bank is very similar to that done for a master cell bank. Thus a master virus bank is tested for sterility and mycoplasma, in vitro and in vivo adventitious virus, and specific viruses (EBV, HBV, HCV, CMV, HIV 1 and 2, AAV, B19, HTLV 1 and 2) if the cells used to produce the MVB were not fully characterized as described for the MCB. Depending on the degree of characterization of the FBS and porcine trypsin, a MVB may require testing for bovine viruses and porcine parvovirus. In addition to the above testing for cell banks, an adenovirus MVB should be tested for replication-competent adenovirus (RCA). RCAs are a common byproduct of adenovirus vector production and are currently considered a safety risk. RCAs most often arise due to molecular recombination between the vector and endogenous elements of the producer cell line genome. Some of these recombinations restore the replication competence of a normally replication-defective vector and give rise to RCA. For example, in the HEK 293 cell-line, endogenous El sequences are required to allov^ replication of the El defective adenovirus vectors. The vectors can undergo homologous recombination with the endogenous El, thus restoring their replication competence. This is a stochastic and unavoidable consequence of the biology of the certain producer cells. Development of producer cells with smaller or no regions of homology between vector and endogenous sequences may reduce homologous recombination but may still support nonhomologous recombination. For most replication defective adenovirus vectors, RCA testing is performed by inoculation of the test material onto a cell line that will support replication of a RCA but not of defective vector. Supernatant from this treatment is passaged to a second cell monolayer. Development of cytopathic effects (CPEs) or lysis indicates the presence of RCA. The current recommended specification for RCA is <1 RCA in a total of 3 x 10^^ virus particles.",

In cases where extensive characterization of the transgene protein is available, no sequencing is necessary and restriction mapping of the vector would be sufficient. However, at a recent meeting of the BRMAC which addressed the issue of structural characterization, it was recommended that vectors <40 kb in length should be characterized by sequencing of the entire vector genome [8] .

Rhesus monkeys, and baboons (Table V) . These toxicities included dose-related, perivascular, and peribronchiolar inflammation, mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates, pulmonary edema, and interstitial pneumonia.

Additionally, when scaled by total body surface area, the NOAEL doses in mice. Cotton rats, hamsters, and baboons for direct instillation of adenovirus into the lungs were approximately equivalent to the human dose of 2 x 10^ lU, or 1.2 x 10^ lU/m^, which was the first dose in humans at which toxicity was observed, when scaled by body surface areas.

This finding allowed for a redesign of the clinical approach to gene therapy for cystic fibrosis, using smaller volumes for instillation of vector and a more targeted approach to deliver the adenovirus to the larger airway epithelial surfaces. To date, cystic fibrosis patients have been treated using two to three logs higher doses of adenovirus with this newer approach without the toxicities observed in the initial clinical trial [13] . In cases where gene transfer vectors may be in limited supply, or for vectors with inherently low toxicity, a maximum feasible dose may be administered as the highest level tested in the preclinical studies. In all studies, and especially when using animal models of the clinical indication, appropriate controls, such as naive or vehicle-treated animals should be included.

These studies have two purposes: (i) first, to identify potential distribution of the vector to sites other than the intended target site, where presence of the vector and/or aberrant expression of the transgene may lead to toxicity; and (ii) to evaluate potential distribution of vector to gonadal tissues and/or transfection of germ cells. In a discussion by the NIH RAC about the risk of potential, inadvertent gene transfer to germ cells, it was concluded that the risk of vertical transmission of the foreign gene was very small. A discussion by the RAC and several expert panelists in gene transfer or reproductive biology recommended that unless there were significant safety issues associated with either the vector or the transgene product, preclinical biodistribution studies in animals were not always required prior to initial Phase 1 trials. In addition, the panel concluded that in cases such as adenoviral vectors, where a large body of literature exists regarding their distribution and potential for toxicity, minor changes in the vector (e.g., substitution of a different transgene with no potential toxicity associated with it) did not require further preclinical distribution studies prior to initiating clinical trials [14] . Biodistribution studies, in which the disposition of the vector is detected after administration by the intended clinical route not only provide data regarding the potential for gonadal uptake and inadvertent germ-line gene transfer, but can also identify any target organs in which aberrant vector distribution or gene expression may be detrimental. CBER's current recommendation is that biodistribution studies of gene transfer agents are not always required prior to Phase 1 clinical trials; however, these studies should be incorporated into the drug development plan so that data are available prior to commencing large-scale, pivotal studies in the clinic [14] .",

Concerns about late adverse sequelae such as new malignancies occurring years or decades following administration of replication-competent, integrating viruses resulted in FDA guidance regarding testing for replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) in product and patient's serum and for lifelong clinical monitoring [26] . These recommendations are currently limited to retroviral vector INDs. Although adenovirus can become replication competent, the FDA had not previously recommended that patients exposed to this class of product be followed long term. Long-term follow-up of gene therapy products was discussed at recent meetings of the Biologies Response Modifier's Advisory Committee [8, 9, 9a ]. FDA will revise the recommendations for long term follow up of recipients of gene transfer products including adenovirus-containing products, pending additional public discussions.",

Bioactivity measures may be laboratory findings, clinical outcomes, or a combination of the two. One measure of bioactivity for gene therapy products is detection of gene transfer and gene expression. This may not be possible where assays for the transgene are not yet developed or are insensitive to low levels of expression. Documentation of clinical or surrogate outcomes and/or alternative assessments (e.g., pharmacodynamic measurements), and correlations, if any, to levels of gene expression, are highly desirable in early product development. The extent to which the generation of such data will be feasible depends on, among other factors, the nature of the product, the clinical population in the study, and the state of the science regarding assays to detect the transgene.",

They must also be designed with appropriate, relevant endpoints that either reflect clinical outcomes or are acceptable surrogate endpoints. Surrogate endpoints are laboratory or other measurements not directly indicating clinical benefit but that are expected to correlate with or predict clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints are usually easier to measure than clinical endpoints and occur earlier in the course of the disease, allowing for shorter, smaller, and, thus, less expensive studies. Their major disadvantage is the uncertainty surrounding whether and to what extent the surrogate reflects the true clinical benefit. Thus, if FDA bases important regulatory decisions regarding product licensure on a surrogate and the medical community bases practice decisions on data generated from trials using surrogates, it is critical that the surrogate be valid for the particular treatment and disease. Once a surrogate is validated for one treatment and disease using a particular product, the extent to which that validation applies to other products in the same class and across product classes could become important, particularly as one might define a product class in the context of adenoviral-containing products. In earlier phases of clinical testing, use of surrogate endpoints may serve useful and potentially less problematic roles. For instance, during product development, a surrogate may be used to assess dose-response and thus provide the rationale for dose selection for later trials, or they may be used as initial proof-of-concept to base decisions about further clinical development. Several excellent papers provide more in-depth discussions about surrogates and validation of surrogates [28, 29] .",

Of the 70 sites inspected, 11 had no current, active clinical trials or had never initiated their proposed studies, and 23 (33%) required no further action from FDA. Approximately half of the sites had objectionable conditions or practices identified by the inspection team; however, in 33 cases (47% of total sites), only voluntary action to correct the deficiencies was called for. Only three sites were identified where official regulatory action (i.e., warning letters) was required. The most common deficiencies in all of these cases were: (i) failure to follow the protocol; (ii) an inadequate consent form; (iii) lack of supporting data for case report form entries and/or discrepancies between the source documents and the case report forms; (iv) inadequate drug accountability records; and (v) the failure to notify the Institutional Review Board(s) of protocol changes, adverse events, or deaths.",
