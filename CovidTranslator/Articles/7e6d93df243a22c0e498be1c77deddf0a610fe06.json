Other patients who show benefit from the use of NIV are those affected of acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPO). Both NIV and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are equally effective in decreasing the needs of intubation and improving mortality in these patients [5] [6] [7] . Finally, immunosuppressed patients have poor outcome when they develop pulmonary infiltrates and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF); in these patients, NIV seems to decrease the needs of intubation and the related morbidity and mortality [8, 9] .",

It is possible that other populations at risk for complications related to invasive mechanical ventilation may benefit from the use of NIV. However, the efficacy of NIV in patients with different types of AHRF is less evident from controlled clinical trials. Although patients with AHRF were less likely to require tracheal intubation when NIV was added to standard therapy, a systematic review of the literature did not support the routine use of NIV in all patients with AHRF due to a less clear effect on mortality and the heterogeneity found among studies, suggesting that effectiveness varies among different populations [12] .",

Moreover, a majority of clinical trials that assessed the efficacy of NIV in patients with AHRF studied mixed populations of patients, with controversial results when all these trials are analysed together. By contrast, few studies have assessed specifically the usefulness of NIV in patients with pneumonia [14] and it is even considered controversial due to a major variability in failure rates [14] [15] [16] [17] , which are generally higher than those observed in COPD [4] or acute CPO [18] .",

The most important rationale for using NIV is to overcome an episode of severe acute respiratory failure (ARF) without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. The background for the use of NIV in severe CAP is related to the presence of severe ARF. Invasive ventilation is indicated in case of life-threatening respiratory failure; however, invasive ventilation is associated to increased risk of severe complications. Since the main objective of NIV in severe ARF in general is help in overcoming the acute episode without the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, by avoiding tracheal intubation, morbidity and mortality would decrease in these patients.",

In general, the use of NIV was followed by a decrease in respiratory rate and increase in arterial hypoxemia after 30 min, with return to the baseline values after NIV was removed. However, the overall intubation rate was 67% in these patients. Among others, advanced age and lower levels of arterial oxygenation were predictors for intubation. Likewise, intubation was associated with higher mortality and longer length of hospital stay. By contrast, those patients in whom NIV avoided intubation had a very favourable outcome. Due to the good outcome in these patients when tracheal intubation was avoided and the fact that the assessment of the efficacy of NIV resulted in minimal delay in intubation, the authors of this study suggested that these patients may undergo a trial of NIV with appropriate monitoring in order to avoid unnecessary delay in intubation. This conflict between a favourable physiological response to NIV and a poor clinical evolution of patients with severe CAP was observed in another study in patients with severe AHRF, 18 with severe CAP and 15 with CPO [16] . Both groups had similar baseline levels of arterial hypoxemia, respiratory rate and heart rate. The improvement in arterial hypoxemia and heart rate was similar in both groups of patients, while respiratory frequency improved only in patients with CPO when NIV was applied. Likewise, the intubation rate was higher and the hospital length of stay was longer in patients with pneumonia. As expected, the hospital mortality rate was substantially higher in intubated than in non-intubated patients.",

            "text": "Concerns have been raised due to the high mortality rate of patients who fail NIV treatment, particularly in those with AHRF and without previous cardiac or respiratory disease (\"de novo\" ARF), and the possibility that unnecessary delay of intubation results in excess mortality [19, 29] . Particularly, an actual mortality of patients intubated after NIV failure higher than mortality predicted by severity scores has been reported [29] . However, these comparisons may be misleading, since severity scores often underestimate hospital mortality in ICU patients [30, 31] . A recent preliminary report on the use of NIV in patients with CAP and severe ARF found for the first time a consistent association between delayed intubation and increased mortality in patients with CAP and \"de novo\" ARF [22] . Longer duration of NIV before intubation was not related with severity of patients at admission in this study. Moreover, patients with shock who needed intubation failed NIV earlier than those without shock. Therefore, this excess of mortality was attributed by the authors to delayed intubation rather than a more severely-ill selected population. By contrast, no relationship was found between delayed intubation and mortality in patients with CAP and previous cardiac or respiratory disease from this study [22] . In summary, patients with severe CAP who receive NIV as a support for severe AHRF are among those with the highest rate of NIV failure. For this reason, when NIV is indicated in these patients, they should be managed in setting with appropriate resources in staff and equipment for a correct monitoring in order to early detect evidences of NIV failure and therefore avoid unnecessary delay in the intubation of patients. However, an appropriate selection of patients with severe CAP and the addition of NIV to the standard treatment may decrease the likelihood to need intubation.",

NIV was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of intubation, complications, mortality, and duration of ICU stay among survivors.

They compared the efficacy of early administration of noninvasive CPAP delivered by the helmet vs. face mask to treat haematological malignancy patients with fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 b200 mmHg). A total of 34 patients were enrolled with a mean PaO 2 /FiO 2 around 140. Oxygenation improved in all patients after non-invasive CPAP. No patient failed helmet CPAP because of intolerance while eight patients in the mask group did so. CPAP could be applied continuously for a longer period of time in the helmet group. The authors concluded that early CPAP with helmet improves oxygenation in selected immunosuppressed patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure even outside the ICU.

First, they assess the safety and feasibility of NIV outside the ICU in haematological patients with severe ARF. Second they have applied a particular interface such as the helmet, that is probably the simplest and easiest way to apply CPAP outside a protected unit, since it does not require any electrical power and/or need of a ventilator. The helmet should however be used with caution, especially in hypercapnic patients, when applying pressure support ventilation, with a commonly used ventilator, due to the possibility of CO 2 rebreathing and of poor patient/ventilator interaction [34, 35] . Third, this study indirectly highlighted that interdisciplinary collaboration between haematologists and intensivists appears crucial for achieving an early implementation of NIV and improving the quality of care. One year later, Rabitsh et al. [36] analysed retrospectively the efficacy of NIV in 35 patients with AHRF after autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, directly ventilated in the bone marrow transplant unit. NIV was delivered by a standard face mask or helmet. Of the eighty-two patients who developed respiratory failure, 47 patients were initially intubated and mechanically ventilated. None of these patients survived. Thirty-five patients initially underwent NIV. Seven of these patients survived and were discharged from the hospital (20%). Eleven of the 35 (31%) patients improved within the first 4 h of NIV with respect to oxygenation and were regarded as responders. In all survivors, the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ) improved after the initiation of NIV while in non-survivors, PaO 2 improved in only 4/28 patients (17%, p b0.0001). The authors concluded that in patients with ARF after stem cell transplantation, NIV could improve prognosis when compared to a group of patients who constantly die if they receive mechanical ventilation.",

Based on the Toronto experience with SARS, in which a certain number of caregivers contracted SARS when a patient was intubated following failure of NIV, the use of NIV was discouraged for these patients [37] . Two subsequent observational studies from China, however, found no evidence of viral spread to caregivers who took appropriate precautions [38, 39] . In the event of a bird flu pandemic, ventilator resources are likely to be severely strained, and NIV may offer a means of supporting some of the afflicted, mainly those with initial respiratory failure. However, NIV is often considered contraindicated in respiratory failure from communicable respiratory airborne diseases unless it is used within a negative pressure isolation room and strict precautions are taken. Several experimental studies have shown substantial exposure to exhaled air within 0.5 to 1 m radius from patients receiving NIV with different facial masks, especially at higher levels of positive pressure [40, 41] . Continuous positive airway pressure has been used to treat ARF in several conditions where alveoli collapse due to increase of transpulmonary pressure over airway closing pressure. Collapsed alveoli do not participate in gas exchange, representing a common example of intrathoracic shunt mechanism of hypoxemia that typically does not respond to oxygen administration. In this case, the only way to improve gas exchange is alveolar recruitment induced by CPAP. Patients breathe against a constant resistance to a supra-atmospheric pressure. This increase of airway pressure is present during the whole breathing cycle; in particular, the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) allows the collapsed alveoli to remain open also during expiration. This means that more alveoli participate to gas exchange, thus leading to improved oxygenation due to shunt effect decrease with improved ventilation/perfusion ratio. This leads to an increase of functional residual capacity (FRC) with compliance increase and decrease of work of breathing.",

This study compared the short-term effect of CPAP at 10 cmH 2 O (CPAP-10) and 2 combinations of NIV with pressure-support ventilation (PSV): an inspiratory support level of 10 cmH 2 O with positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH 2 O (PSV 10-10) and an inspiratory support level of 15 cmH 2 O with PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O (PSV 15-5) [44] . Compared with spontaneous breathing, the respiratory frequency decreased with the highest levels of inspiratory support (PSV . By contrast, arterial oxygenation improved similarly with CPAP-10 and PSV 10-10, while this increase failed to reach statistical significance for PSV 15-5. Finally, the work of breathing decreased with both modalities of NIV but not with CPAP (Fig. 3) , although the highest reduction in dyspnoea was achieved with PSV 15-5. However, the authors discuss as a major limitation their specific CPAP experimental setting. They state that the disappointing results observed with CPAP may be explained in part by the type of patient, the interface, and the ventilator used to deliver CPAP. Moreover, the authors point out that a low level of PSV was applied during the initial and final periods to compensate for the dead space imposed by the circuit and the measurement apparatus, However, no PSV level was added during CPAP trial. Although designed to compensate for the load imposed by the circuit during spontaneous breathing, one cannot exclude that the absence of this low PSV level during the CPAP trial could explain part of the tidal volume decrease noted after switching from initial baseline to CPAP.",

The effects on oxygenation of helmet CPAP were compared with Venturi mask in patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxemia (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \u2265210 and \u2264 285). The primary endpoint was the time to reach a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio >315. Forty-seven patients were recruited: 20 randomised to CPAP and 27 controls received oxygen. Patients randomised to CPAP reached the end-point in a median of 1.5 h, whereas controls reached the end point in 48 h (p b0.001). The proportion of patients who reached the primary end-point was 95% (19/20) among the CPAP group and 30% (8/27) among controls (p b0.001). However, 1 h after reaching the primary end-point, only 2/14 patients in the CPAP group maintained a PaO 2 /FiO 2 value >315, suggesting that PEEP is rapidly effective but should be applied for longer period to obtain clinically relevant effect. However, the effect on oxygenation was not applied for a longer period of time, therefore, the possible decreasing efficacy of CPAP with time, as observed in the study of Delclaux, was not tested. The authors conclude that CPAP delivered by helmet rapidly improves oxygenation in patients with CAP suffering from a moderate hypoxemic ARF. Therefore, this study may represent a proof-of-concept evaluation of the potential usefulness of CPAP in patients with CAP, since the similar effect on oxygenation observed in Delcalux' study was obtained in a mixed population including patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.",

            "text": "The first randomised controlled study comparing CPAP with oxygen alone was published in 2000 [47] . Delclaux et al. enrolled 123 consecutive patients admitted to 6 ICUs with severe ARF (PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio \u2264300 mmHg). This population consisted of patients with pneumonia in 54% and acute pulmonary oedema in the remaining cases. Baseline 78 \u00b1 14 [18] 73 \u00b1 12 [25] .794 1 h 74 \u00b1 7.4 [9] 75 \u00b1 8.9 [11] Heart rate, beats/min Baseline 89 \u00b1 15 [20] 94 \u00b1 16 [25] .189 1 h 84 \u00b1 12 [12] 93 \u00b1 18 [13] Despite an initial physiologic improvement in patients treated with CPAP (after 1 h of treatment the median PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio was greater with CPAP than patents with oxygen alone, Fig. 4) , the final outcomes were not significantly different between the two treatments. The application of CPAP failed to reduce the endotracheal intubation rate (34% vs. 39% in the standard therapy group, p = 0.53), hospital mortality (31% vs. 30%, p = 0.89), or ICU length of stay. A higher number of adverse events occurred with CPAP treatment (18 vs. 6; p = 0.01). The authors concluded that despite an early physiologic improvement, CPAP neither reduced the need for intubation nor improved outcomes in patients with acute hypoxemic, nonhypercapnic respiratory insufficiency primarily due to acute lung injury. However, several concerns have been raised on this study. First, the title of the study states that hypoxemic non-hypercapnic patients were enrolled. However, exclusion criteria were acute respiratory acidosis defined as a pH b7.30 and a PaCO 2 >50 mmHg and COPD. This means that patients with ALI/ARDS may have been enrolled with an initial acute respiratory acidosis with pH \u22657.30 and PaCO 2 \u226450 mmHg. Indeed, patients treated with CPAP had a median respiratory rate of 34 breaths/min (95th percentiles = 20-60) with a median pH of 7.42 (7.21-7.62 ) and PaCO 2 37 mmHg (23-61). Second, this hypothesis is indirectly confirmed by the authors when they state that a large proportion of patients enrolled met the definition of ARDS that has been demonstrated a negative prognostic factor of hypoxemic ARF together with pneumonia [13] .Third, among patients enrolled, only 54% had pneumonia. Hence, it is hard to conclude from this study that CPAP is not effective in pneumonia, since results are not described according to subgroups of diseases such as acute CPO, near-drowning and SIRS/shock. Fourth, among the 61 patients randomised to oxygen alone, 5 (8%) were switched to CPAP but the authors did not indicate whether their outcome was attributed to the initial treatment arm. Finally, pneumonia is an infectious disease and survival is associated to a correct antibiotic therapy and supportive measures which are not discussed in the paper. In conclusion, since this trial was not conducted on strictly hypoxemic patients with pneumonia but rather on heterogeneous hypoxemic/hypoxemic-hypercapnic subjects mainly suffering from ARDS, these data add limited evidence-based information on the efficacy of CPAP in pneumonia. Another randomised controlled trial on the use of CPAP vs. oxygen alone has been published in 2010 [45] . This study was focused to the evaluation of the efficacy of CPAP application in terms of oxygenation specifically in a population of patients with pneumonia and moderately severe non-hypercapnic hypoxemia. The inclusion criteria were moderate acute respiratory failure (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \u2265210 and \u2264285 mmHg, and respiratory rate \u226435 breaths/min). Patients were randomised to receive helmet CPAP or standard oxygen therapy (control group). The primary end-point was the time to reach a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio \u2265315 mmHg. Patients who did not reach this threshold level before the last planned arterial blood gas measurement at 48 h were considered as failures. Forty-seven patients were recruited: 20 randomised to CPAP and 27 to controls. Patients randomised to CPAP reached the end-point in a median of 1.5 h, whereas controls reached the end-point in 48 h (p b0.001). The proportion of patients who reached the primary end-point was 19 (95%) in the CPAP group and 8 (30%) among controls (p b0.001). One hour after reaching the primary end-point, 2/14 patients in the CPAP group maintained a PaO 2 /FiO 2 value \u2265315. The authors concluded that CPAP application in patients with moderate hypoxemic ARF due to CAP improves oxygenation. Moreover, the most impressive finding was the rapid effect of CPAP in comparison with standard oxygen therapy. Another interesting finding is the vanishing of the oxygenation improvement once CPAP was discontinued. This phenomenon has been defined by the authors as the \"on-off\" effect of CPAP on pneumonia, as already seen in patients with pneumonia treated with NIV [15] . Therefore, in order to obtain not only a physiologic but also a significant clinical effect, it could be necessary to open and keep open the lungs of patients with pneumonia through the application of CPAP while waiting for the antibiotic effect. In conclusion, this study proved the effect of CPAP in improving gas exchange in a well-defined model of hypoxemic ARF, such as CAP. The authors conclude that their study represents a proof-of-concept study that could sustain the development of future trials analysing clinical outcomes and possible adverse events in a population of patients with more severe CAP treated with CPAP. These trials would be needed to evaluate the possible role of CPAP as a valid and a safe tool in the management of patients with CAP. Until further randomised controlled trials define this issue, we do not recommend the use of this technique in patients with CAP with severe respiratory failure.",

First, in acute CPO, PEEP application induces favourable physiological effects on the cardiopulmonary compartment on both sides, respiratory and cardiocirculatory, whereas in pneumonia the effects on heart may be detrimental. This means that in acute CPO, DO 2 and tissue perfusion are favoured by CPAP application. Second, in pneumonia, the beneficial respiratory effect on oxygenation through alveolar recruitment represents only a part of the strategy to improve tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Indeed, tissue perfusion depends on both mean arterial pressure and DO 2 ; the latter is related only in part to arterial blood oxygenation, but also to haemoglobin and cardiac output. Hence, it is easy to understand that a unique improvement in arterial oxygenation is not sufficient to assure an optimal tissue perfusion. Therefore, in pneumonia it is crucial always focusing on the triad concurring to DO 2 , i.e. arterial oxygenation, cardiac output, and haemoglobin, as recommended in the approach to severe sepsis, mainly represented by pneumonia.",

The use of noninvasive ventilation in these patients may decrease the need for intubation and improve the poor outcome associated with these complications. \u2022 Continuous positive airway pressure has been used to treat acute respiratory failure in several conditions characterised by alveolar collapse. While this is extremely useful in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, the efficacy in pneumonia seems limited to immunosuppressed patients with pulmonary complications. \u2022 Conversely, there are no sufficient evidences on the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure in immunocompetent patients with pneumonia and severe acute respiratory failure.",
