First, although those samples were collected from three medical centers with different prevalence rates, EPS were tested only in mild and common patients, excluding samples of severe patients. Second, semen samples were not obtained, due to some restrictions like non-private ward environment of mobile cabin hospitals, anxiety during isolation period, so the safety of sexual intercourse still remains to be known. Third, our sample size is relatively small, with only 60 cases. In the next study, large samples and long-term follow-up are needed to assess whether sexual intercourse is a potential route for virus transmission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

From the China-WHO investigation on COVID-19, it reported that SARS-CoV-2 was an animal virus, and that air transmission was not considered as the main mode. it indicated that the interpersonal transmission mainly occurred within households in China. So far SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the gastrointestinal tract, saliva, and urine, so these routes of potential transmission need to be investigated.It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 shares 76% amino acid sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) and is likely to use the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry into target host cells8,9 \uff0c The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 with its receptor is more 10 to 20 times higher than ones of else corona virus, like SARSr-CoV and MERSr-CoV 10 . Investigation of the expression pattern of ACE2 in adult human testis at the level of single-cell transcriptomes indicates that ACE2 is predominantly enriched in spermatogonia, leydig and sertoli cells. Further research shows that enrichment of ACE2 in leydig and sertoli cells has a All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
