Meninglomas in cats are characterized as being slow-growing, space-occupying masses that have a histopathologically benign character in most cases. This is dependent upon the location of the mass and its size. These tumors can occur singly or in multiple sites. Meningiomas will typically affect the older feline patient (>8 years); males are disproportionately affected over female. [7] [8] [9] Clinical signs tend to vary according to location of the mass. The most common site affected is the forebrain, and because of this, one of the prime presenting complaints is seizures, either generalized or focal. Other forebrain signs include behavior changes, circling in the direction of the lesion, contralateral vision loss, contralateral partial cranial nerve deficits, mild contralateral hemlpares]s, contralateral conscious propnoceptive loss, and hemisensory loss. These signs usually occur insidiously and are gradually progressive in nature, sometimes over months. Owners may complam of abnormal sleep/wake patterns, poor elimination habits and abnormal vocalization; these signs will often times improve dramatically after one or more doses of corucosteroids. This response occurs secondary to the transient decrease in the tremendous peritumoral edema caused by these masses. Once the me&cation is discontinued, the aforementioned signs usually recur. Cats with meningiomas are, in some instances, prone to either caudal transtentorial or foramen magnum brain herniation, which can arise suddenly and cause a rapid deterioration due to brainstem compression. Positional nystagmus was observed with transtentorial herniation in one report. 9 Other signs of herniation include: anisocoria progressing to dilated, nonresponsive pupils, changes in mentation and levels of consciousness, and respiratory patterns, and changes in motor extensor tone.",

Some individuals advocate a modified occipital view, in which the x-ray beam is directed at the foramen magnum. 9 EEG may also be done to help localize the location of the lesion and/or identify paroxysmal epileptlform discharges. If available, CT scan and/or MRI allow more defimtive identification of forebraln lesions such as meningiomas and other neoplasms. MRI provides greater soft tissue and anatomic detail than CT and so is the preferred modality for imaging intracranial neoplasia. On both CT and MRI, most meningiomas are superficial (extraaxial), attached broadly to the meninges, and uniformly enhance with contrast. Glial tumors and LSA tend to be located within the brain (intraaxial) and may show a pattern of ring enhancement and/or poor enhancement with contrast, respectively, Vasogenic edema and obstructive hydroencephalus can also be observed with CT and MRI. Ideally, definitive diagnosis should be based upon biopsy and histopathology. Treatment for intracranml neoplasms can be either surgical, involve chemotherapy, radiation therapy or a combination of the above, r-l\u00b0 Surgical resection of feline meningiomas is the treatment of choice and, in many cases, may be curative, since regrowth is so slow. Improvement can often be observed within 24 hours to 1 week after surgery and may continue thereafter. Postoperative use of antiepileptic drugs is recommended if prior seizures have occurred, r Tumors other than meningiomas are less amenable to surgical intervention. Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy should be considered for these tumor types. In general, the glial tumors have a poor response to the above modes of treatment. The corticosteroids, prednisone and dexamethasone, may be of some benefit in the relief of peritumoral edema. These palliative effects may last for weeks to months with minimal side effects.

Absolute polycythemta involves an absolute increase in RBC numbers and can be termed secondary (appropriate vs. inappropriate) versus primary (polycythemla vera). Secondary polycythemia can occur due to chronic hypoxic states (appropriate release of erythoropoietin) or due to inappropriate production of erythropoietin secondary to hydronephrosis, renal carcinoma, or other neoplasia. These causes should be ruled out with appropriate tests. Polycythemia vera (primary erythrocytosis) is the most common of the polycythemias and is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by autonomous proliferation of erythroid precursors that mature into normal erythrocytes. The result is increased total RBC volume with normal to low blood erythropoietin concentration. 9,26 27 Increased RBC volume increases blood volume and viscosity causing impaired blood flow, stasis, and tissue hypoxia. Neurologic signs include seizures, blindness, abnormal behavior, aggression, ataxia, pupillary dilation, and ptyalism. Other clinical signs include PU/PD, lethargy, head bobbing, and muscle twitching. Most cats with clinical signs will have hematocrits greater than 63% without any identifiable causes of relative or secondary polycythemia. 26, 27 The drug of choice for treatment of primary polycythemia is Car accidents, falls, and other forms of blunt trauma can lead to head trauma in the cat. The clinical signs observed with trauma depend upon the location and severity of the lesion. 3-s,9 Neurologic signs can include seizures (either immediate or delayed), diffuse or lateralizing forebrain signs, ataxia and heml-or tetraparesis. Skull radiography, CT, or MRI aid in the assessment for skull fractures or contusions and help determine the need for surgical intervention. 9 Treatment consists of immediate stabilization of shock, administration of steroids (though controversial), nursing support, and observation for signs of herniation. Mannitol and diuretics may be required if elevated intracranial pressure is present. Once a critical period of 36 to 48 hours has elapsed without progression of signs, the prognosis is good. Signs will usually improve, but residual deficits may persist. Owners should be informed of the potential need for antiepileptic drugs either at the time of the trauma or in the future.",

Hyperthyroidism may affect the CNS, the neuromuscular system, or both. 2s Normally, the brain maintains thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations in a narrow range. The pathogenesis of seizures may be linked to the ability of thyroid hormones to directly decrease the electrical threshold of cerebral tissue. Other pathogenic factors involve changes in cerebral oxygen and glucose consumption, as well as altered cerebral blood flow. Additionally, elevated thyroid hormone levels can alter a variety of neurotransmitters, z5, 28 The clinical signs associated with thyrotoxicosis include weight loss, diarrhea, vomiting, polyuria/polydipsia and hyperactivity, although 10% of cats are described as having apathetic hyperthyroidism.

In many cases of feline epilepsy, an underlying cause of the seizures is suspected but never proven antemortem. These include previous posttraumatic, postinflammatory and postischemic lesions that are quiescent (in the interictal period) and nonprogressive. Partial or generalized seizures are the only residual signs observed. This form of epilepsy is probably more common than true idiopathic epilepsy in the cat. 3 Diagnostic imaging (especially CT or MRI) may be of benefit in determining the presence of a past skull fracture or brain lesion. Subclinical viral encephalItides may lead to a gliotic scar (seizure focus) in brain which may not even be visible with MRI. Small epileptic loci may also go undetected on histological examination. 3.15 The incidence of idiopathic epilepsy in the feline had been reported to range from 0% in some studies to as high as 59% in others3 ,3,4 In the study reporting a 0% incidence, all cats (of which there were 30) were assumed to have structural brain disease on the basis of number and frequency of seizures, occurrence of partial seizures, focal neurologmal deficits, and/or CSF and MRI abnormalities. In the study with a 59% seizure incidence, Idiopathic epilepsy was a presumptive diagnosis because no clinical cause could be identified after extensive examination; these cats were between the ages of 6 months and 3 years. Of the 12 cats necropsied in this study, 7 were found to have no histological changes that would account for their seizures, although in 4 of the 7, selective neuronal necrosis and/or sclerosis was observed in Ammon's horn, a portion of the hippocampus. These changes were thought to be caused by the seizures alone. On the basis of these findings, a presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy was made3 Follow-up exams, drug levels, survival times, and eventually necropsy in a large population of cats with undetermined causes of seizures should be camed out to estimate the frequency of true idiopathic epilepsy in the cat. Long-term treatment with antiepileptlc drugs is warranted in both groups of patients. Phenobarbital at a dose of 2 mg/kg two to three times daily is the drug of choice. Oral diazepam can be used but can be assocmted with paradoxical excitation, increased appetite, and, rarely, hepatm necrosis. <> See discusslon of the use of phenobarbital and diazepam in the cat in the chapter \"Antiepileptic Drugs\" m this issue.",
