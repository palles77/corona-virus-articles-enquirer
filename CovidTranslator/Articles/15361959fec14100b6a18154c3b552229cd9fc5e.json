The virus isolated would have to be matched against a battery of antibodies and ultimately specific pathogen-free cats would have to be exposed to the isolate in order to establish its pathogenicity. The patient would have recovered months before this time-consuming and expensive laboratory work had been completed. This may seem a ludicrous example, yet many veterinarians almost routinely request feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) antibody titers on their patients without an adequate understanding of the extreme vagaries of this test. Veterinarians should not have to ask themselves, \"Why did I request this test?\" after the test has been completed; rather they should ask, \"What specific test will either confirm or rule out the tentative diagnosis of the problems exhibited by the patient?\".",

Many of these viral infections may co-exist in the same host. Calicivirus and herpesvirus infections frequently occur simultaneously. Feline leukemia virus infection produces an immunosuppression, rendering the infected cat highly susceptible to feline infectious peritonitis, calicivirus, or herpesvirus infection as well as bacterial or other infections. Secondary or simultaneous bacterial, protozoan, chlamydial, mycoplasma, or fungal infections may also occur with many viral infections of the cat.",

The SN test is based on the fact that specific antibodies (neutralizing antibodies) in the patient's serum will \"neutralize\" the specific antigen (virus) that was responsible for that antibody production. Dilutions of the patient's serum are added to a known amount of the virus and the mixture is incubated for a period of time that depends on the virus being used. After incubation, the mixture is inoculated onto cell cultures. If neutralizing antibody was not present in the mixture, typical cytopathology caused by the unneutralized virus appears. If neutralizing antibody was present in amounts sufficient to neutralize the virus, no cytopathologic changes are observed. The end point is determined as the greatest serum dilution that reduces the cytopathic effect of the virus by 50 per cent. In most instances, in order to use the SN test as an aid in diagnosis, serum must be drawn early in the course of the disease and again 3 weeks later. A fourfold or greater increase in SN antibody in the second sample is an indication that the patient was indeed exposed to the virus in question. Cats recovering from panleukopenia or calicivirus infection often develop a high SN antibody response, whereas cats recovering from herpesvirus infections develop only a slight SN antibody response. The fact that two samples must be collected at 3-week intervals, the varying test parameters depending on the antigen in question, and often the vagaries of the test itself severely limit the usefulness of the SN test (or CF or HAl) in diagnosis of viral disease. However, the SN test can be extremely useful in determining the response of cats to vaccination against panleukopenia, calicivirus, and herpesvirus infection and possibly feline leukemia if there are questions regarding the efficacy of the vaccine or the cat' s ability to respond.",

These tests can be used to detect specific viral infections in infected cells in cell cultures, in tissue sections, and in impression smears, and also to detect specific viral antibodies. The direct or indirect procedure may be used. The direct fluorescent antibody technique involves the application of a specific, fluorescein-labelled antibody to the specimens. If that specimen contains the viral antigen, a fluorescein-labelled antigen-antibody complex is formed and will be visible using a fluorescent microscope with the proper filters. The classic example of the application of the direct fluorescent antibody (FA) technique is in the diagnosis of rabies. A fresh section of the hypothalamus is flooded with fluorescein-labelled antibody and examined under fluorescent light. The labelled rabies antibody attaches to any rabies virus present in the specimen and the fluorescence of the labelled antibody-antigen complex is easily visible. If no antigen (rabies virus) is present, the labelled antibody is removed in the washing process and no fluorescence is visible-this is a negative test. This test has reduced the amounts of time spent in the diagnosis of rabies and increased the accuracy of the diagnosis. The FA technique may be used in the diagnosis of panleukopenia (intestinal epithelium, cell culture cells), calicivirus (oropharyngeal cells), herpesvirus infections (oropharyngeal or conjunctival smears), and pseudorabies (brain and/or tonsil sections) as well as rabies.",

The preparation is washed again and then examined under a fluorescent microscope. The classic example of the application of the IF A test in the diagnosis of feline virus infection is the IF A feline leukemia test. An air-dried blood smear from a cat suspected of being infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is treated with acetone to break down the cell wall of the neutrophils and flooded with rabbit (or bovine) serum from an animal immunized against the p27 antigen of the feline leukemia virus. After allowing adequate time for the formation of antigen-antibody complexes, if antigen was indeed present in the smear, the preparation is washed and fluorescein-labelled antirabbit (or bovine) immunoglobulin is added. The preparation is again washed and then examined under a fluorescent microscope. If the p27 antigen of the feline leukemia virus was present in the neutrophils or platelets in the blood smear, the rabbit (or bovine) origin anti-p27 would form an antigen-antibody complex that would not be removed by the first wash. The fluorescein-labelled antirabbit (or bovine) globulin would then adhere to the rabbit (or bovine) globulin complexed with the p27 antigen in the preparation, and the typical fluorescence would be visible in the neutrophils or platelets on examination under a fluorescent microscope.

After incubation, the excess antibody is washed away. This is the lower piece of the sandwich. The unknown sample (serum, and so on) is then added to the well, allowed to incubate, and the well is washed again. The unknown contitutes the \"filler\" of the sandwich. If the specific antigen (p27) is present in the unknown, it will complex with the antibody and not be washed away. An enzyme-antibody conjugate is then added as the top piece of the sandwich and allowed to incubate, and the well is washed to remove any enzymeconjugated antibody that did not complex to form the \"sandwich.\" Then one adds an enzyme substrate that, when acted upon, the enzyme present in the top piece of the sandwich will change color. A positive test records a color change; a negative test does not change color. The feline leukemia ELISA, which tests for the presence of the p27 antigen in the unknown sample, is quite sensitive and specific when the test is properly conducted.

A tentative diagnosis is based on the history and clinical signs exhibited by the patient. The fact that this statement is not repeated for each disease in the following discussion should not be interpreted to deprecate the significance of the clinical examination in diagnosis of feline viral disease. A final diagnosis of a specific viral disease is based upon a combination of factors, including the history, characteristic clinical signs, and virus isolation or identification by other means. Virus identification, short of actual isolation, may embrace cytologic or histopathologic examination of smears, scrapings, or tissue sections, including the finding of typical inclusion bodies, fluorescent antibody or ELISA identification of viral antigens, or the demonstration of virus by electron microscopy. Virus isolation or identification by the means described merely indicates the presence, in the patient, of the particular virus isolated or identified. Such isolation or identification does not prove that the problems of the patient are a direct result of damage produced by the virus isolated. It is essential that such isolation procedures be combined with the observation of characteristic clinical signs or pathologic lesions in order to confirm a diagnosis. It is extremely difficult to evaluate the significance of serum antibody levels, even the demonstration of a rising antibody titer, as determined by virus neutralization, ELISA, or immunofluorescent techniques. The significance of such test results is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the specificity of the test reagents (antibodies against FIP and FECV cannot be differentiated), possible previous exposure to the agent, and the effect of vaccination. Under certain circumstances, the determination of serum antibody levels may be of value in disease diagnosis when correlated with the patient's history and the clinical signs exhibited; however, as a general rule, such tests are of very limited value in clinical diagnosis. The determination of serum antibody levels is of much greater value in epizootiologic surveys and in assaying response to vaccination.",

One must realize also that a negative ELISA, IF A test, or virus isolation indicates only that the virus or the p27 antigen was not demonstrable in the specific sample being tested; the virus or viral antigen may well be present elsewhere in the body. If, for example, a clinical diagnosis of mediastinal lymphosarcoma has been made on the basis of clinical findings and typical cytology seen in a thoracic effusate, it is superfluous to perform an ELISA or IF A test on the patient. A negative blood test performed on the patient could easily be misinterpreted to mean either that the cytologic evaluation is in error or that the patient is not capable of spreading the leukemia virus. Both of these assumptions are likely to be incorrect. It is also important to completely evaluate the disease problems that may be observed in an ELISA or IFA test-positive patient.

The hemogram will often demonstrate a marked rise in serum protein (globulin) and an absolute lymphopenia, in the face of leukopenia or leukocytosis, at the height of disease. 1 The exudate is rather characteristic and contains a high number of neutrophils (Fig. 4) . A cat exposed to FIP virus will usually respond by producing antibodies that may be demonstrated by the ELISA or IF A, or by virus neutralization tests. The cat that develops clinical FIP may demonstrate an antibody titer significantly greater than 1:1600. Unfortunately, there are a number of variables that make interpreting the test extremely difficult, and misinterpretation is extremely common. The tests are not well standardized and a fourfold variation in reported titers may occur; thus, one laboratory may report a 1:400 titer, another a 1:1600, and third laboratory may report a 1:6400 titer on three samples drawn from the same patient at the same time. Antibodies against feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) cross-react with antibodies against FIP and the ELISA and IF A tests do not distinguish between the two. A cat infected with FECV does not often develop an antibody titer greater than 1:1600, even though it may; conversely, a cat with clinical FIP may not evidence a titer greater than 1:400. Cats infected with FIPV, but not diseased, may develop titers greater than 1:6400. Whether or not cats with high FIP antibody titers but without disease signs are more likely to be FIP virus shedders than cats with lower antibody titers has not be conclusively demonstrated. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it becomes obvious that ELISA and IFA test antibody titers are without significance in FIP diagnosis unless the results are very carefully correlated with the clinical signs of disease and results of other laboratory tests (such as CBC and cytology).",
