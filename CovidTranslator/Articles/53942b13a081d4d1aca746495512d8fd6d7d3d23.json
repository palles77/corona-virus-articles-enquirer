In the tropics, the seasonality of such infections is less distinct -within 10 degrees latitude (north and south) of the equator, most studies show no seasonal trends '. Group A Human Rotavirus comprises a number of different serotypes, the most common being G1, G2, G3 and G4 9 \u2022 These serotypes were the target of the recently developed and subsequently withdrawn vaccine against Rotavirus 1(). However, the significant presence of G9 serotype throughout Australia in recent years suggests the emergence of a compounding implication for future vaccine types ' . The economic and social costs of Rotavirus infection are enormous, notwithstanding the emotional trauma for children and parents. The cost of treating Rotavirus infection alone has been estimated to be in excess of \u00a36.5 million annually in the United Kingdom \". In the USA, direct medical costs are estimated to be $264 million with $1 billion in total costs to society\". In Australia, hospital and social costs for all Rotavirus infections are approximately $26 million annually 13.

Additionally, in most remote communities with more than 150 people, there are remote health services operated by both Territory Health Services and nongovernment Aborigina l medical services. The Royal Flying Doctor Service is designed to arrange emergency and planned medical escorts over vast distances.

Firstly, the heavy work load of the paediatricians limited their involvement in the management team meetings. Their input was needed, especially when matters of clinical judgment were being debated or informed -their input should have been sought irrespective of their ability to attend such meetings personally.Secondly, over-communication can be a trap, especially with respect to media interest and enquiries. To overcome, this, media matters were last on the meeting agenda and only those directly involved in the media response were asked to remain to deal with how such matters were to be articulated. Media announcements and messages are a vital tool for public awareness and information and cannot be underestimated; however, the time involved in this work can be distracting for busy health professionals with more immediate considerations of patient and organisational safety.No single source or index case was identified to explain the cause or size of this outbreak. It is hypothesised that it may have been the result of infection with Rotavirus serotype G9, a relatively new strain of the virus in Australia. For this reason it is thought that most children would not have developed any natural immunity or resistance to this strain of the disease.",
