However, there is a lack of epidemiological tools to guide effective public policy development. Here we present epidemiological evidence that SARS-CoV-2 S type exited Wuhan or other epicenters in China earlier than L type and conferred partial resistance to the virus on infected populations. Analysis of regional disparities in incidence has revealed that a sharp decline in influenza epidemics is a useful surrogate indicator for the undocumented spread of SARS-CoV-2. The biggest concern in the world is knowing when herd immunity has been achieved and scheduling a time to regain the living activities of each country. This study provides a useful tool to guide the development of local policies to contain the virus.",

Once the herd immunity is completed, the government can confidently decide when to lift the restriction. Therefore, the government must predict trends in the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. There is no waiting in a pandemic and no time to wait for scientific confirmation. At such times epidemiology exists to determine public health policy first and foremost. Unfortunately, no government knows epidemiological methods for predicting their own SARS-CoV-2 status. Here, we developed the world's first influenza-based epidemiological method as a useful proxy to detect the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the establishment of partial herd immunity in countries. ",

But why mortality rates vary from country to country remains enigmatic. We arranged influenza epidemic curves of European countries in descending order of COVID-19 mortality (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). There seems to be a pattern in the curve related to COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFR). Depending on the likelihood of S-type SRS-CoV-2 transmission, a scoring system was developed to model the mortality-related curve patterns. As shown in Fig. 3 , this score correlates with the SARS-CoV-2 CFR in each country, implying that the extent of S type SARS-CoV-2 transmission determines the severity of the current infection. This scoring system is useful as a country-specific COVID-19 severity risk score. As shown in Fig. 4 , the risk score reveals geographic effects on the spread of the",
