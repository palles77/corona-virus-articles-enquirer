            "text": "| Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a clinical diagnosis characterized by left ventricular or biventricular dilation and impaired contraction that is not explained by abnormal loading conditions (for example, hypertension and valvular heart disease) or coronary artery disease. Mutations in several genes can cause DCM, including genes encoding structural components of the sarcomere and desmosome. Nongenetic forms of DCM can result from different aetiologies, including inflammation of the myocardium due to an infection (mostly viral); exposure to drugs, toxins or allergens; and systemic endocrine or autoimmune diseases. The heterogeneous aetiology and clinical presentation of DCM make a correct and timely diagnosis challenging. Echocardiography and other imaging techniques are required to assess ventricular dysfunction and adverse myocardial remodelling, and immunological and histological analyses of an endomyocardial biopsy sample are indicated when inflammation or infection is suspected. As DCM eventually leads to impaired contractility , standard approaches to prevent or treat heart failure are the first-line treatment for patients with DCM. Cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators may be required to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias. In addition, identifying the probable cause of DCM helps tailor specific therapies to improve prognosis. An improved aetiology-driven personalized approach to clinical care will benefit patients with DCM, as will new diagnostic tools, such as serum biomarkers, that enable early diagnosis and treatment. *www.nature.com/nrdp P r i m e r 0123456789(); P r i m e r 0123456789(); P r i m e r 0123456789(); P r i m e r 0123456789(); 7 NATURE REVIEwS | DIsEAsE PRIMERs | Article citation ID: (2019) 5:32 P r i m e r 0123456789(); P r i m e r 0123456789(); 9 NATURE REVIEwS | DIsEAsE PRIMERs | Article citation ID: (2019) 5:32 P r i m e r 0123456789(); P r i m e r 0123456789(); P r i m e r 0123456789();",

Idiopathic and familial disease are the most commonly reported causes of DCM. To accurately identify the aetiology of DCM, a wide array of non-invasive and invasive examinations are needed 6, 7 , but wide variability exists globally in the availability of advanced diagnostic tools (such as genetic testing for inborn metabolic errors, for example, and comprehensive cardiac imaging). Thus, many cases of DCM could be classified as idiopathic when in fact a thorough evaluation would enable a precise diagnosis of the underlying aetiology. Ongoing advances in genetic sequencing and molecular methods are increasing the resources available to clinicians to determine the disease aetiology and provide a tailored risk stratification, resources which improve patient care and could potentially reverse disease progression. Further complicating the clinically heterogeneous presentation of DCM are differences that exist according to sex, age of onset (which can have an acute or progressive presentation), rate of progression, risk of development of overt heart failure and probability of sudden cardiac death 8, 9 . Finally, both inherited predisposition and environmental factors play an important part in the natural history of disease.",

Survival of patients with DCM who develop heart failure has improved over time in developed countries. Improvements in survival have been attributed in large part to the increased availability and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and heart transplantation 21-23 . However, these interventions are not available to most of the world's population. Furthermore, the effect of medications, ventricular devices and heart transplantation on the natural history of DCM is not well characterized, and despite advances in the management of heart failure in patients with DCM, there is still substantial mortality.",

Similarly, in patients with DCM, there is evidence of scar tissue, with the left ventricle assuming a spherical shape. Pathophysiological changes include a decrease in stroke volume (blood volume pumped by the left ventricle at each contraction) and cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute), impaired ventricular filling and an increase in end-diastolic pressure (the amount of blood in the ventricle when relaxed, which is a measure of dilation). Compensatory changes in the vascular system include an increase in systemic vascular resistance, a decrease in arterial compliance and an increase in venous pressure and circulating blood volume. Both cardiac preload (stretching of the heart wall before contraction) and afterload (the force needed for contraction to eject blood from the heart) are increased, with increased afterload resulting in elevated wall stress. Diastole involves both active relaxation (early diastole) and passive compliance (mid-to-late diastole). In DCM, diastolic dysfunction that affects both components can accompany a reduction in systolic function. Impaired ventricular relaxation results in reduced rapid ventricular filling.",

Gene curation is also of fundamental importance for the discovery of DCM-associated genes. What level of evidence is required to change the classification of a gene from a gene of uncertain significance for DCM to a gene of confirmed relevance and one that is routinely included in clinical testing panels is unclear. The ideal gene discovery scenario is having one or more large multigenerational DCM pedigrees with numerous affected family members, or several smaller families, each family having the same very rare gene variant, and unaffected individuals who do not carry that variant. Additional supporting evidence would be genome-wide sequencing that has excluded the presence of rare variants in other established DCM-associated genes. However, this scenario is rarely achieved as DCM is usually a lethal condition, and few large families exist. For this reason, most studies include cohorts of individual patients with DCM, whose DCM-associated candidate genes are sequenced and rare coding variants are identified, and the numbers of individuals with rare variants in a gene are compared with the numbers of individuals in large, publicly accessible reference data sets who also carry rare coding variants of the same type 37,54 . The largest of these public databases is the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) 55 , an expansion of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database, now having exome or genome sequences of >140,000 individuals from the general population, presumably with no known DCM. In response to the need for a systematic approach to gene curation 56 , the ClinGen consortium 57 , a large collaborative effort sponsored by the US National Human Genome Research Institute 57 , has published a systematic approach to integrate genetic and experimental evidence for gene-disease relationships. This approach uses a semi-quantitative scoring system that has been validated across several Mendelian diseases, and as a result, the evidence supporting the association between a specific gene and a disease is classified as definitive, strong, moderate, limited, absent or conflicting. This approach has been used by the ClinGen Cardiovascular Disease Working Group 57 for gene curation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 58 , and curation of genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and DCM is now underway.",

Some variants that had been considered rare by comparison to control DNA samples from a few hundred individuals are more common than previously thought and unlikely to be disease causing. Studies have leveraged the ExAC database of >60,000 exome sequences 55 and have shown that the frequency of rare variants in control populations mirrors that of some genes proposed as relevant for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 54 , thereby questioning the relevance attributed to such variants. This paradigm is also applicable to DCM. In 2015, the American College of Medical Genetics substantially revised the approach to variant interpretation 60 for clinical sequencing, making the approach and application of standards much more rigorous, with an overall effect of making interpretation more conservative to adjudicate variants as pathogenetic or probably pathogenetic. A variant is considered to be probably pathogenetic if there is a \u226590% probability that the variant is pathogenetic. All variants not meeting these rigorous standards are noted as variants of uncertain significance. Furthermore, the recently developed but rapidly expanding database ClinVar 61 now has assertions of variant pathology in a publicly accessible database. ClinGen is interacting with ClinVar to populate ClinVar with curated variants in medically relevant genes, including those associated with cardiomyopathies. The final frontier for DCM genetics may be the deciphering of the interrelationships, if any, of genetic disease pathways with other established nongenetic disease mechanisms, including, for example, immunological or infectious aetiologies 62 . Large studies linking genetic and nongenetic causes in a unified research approach have yet to be accomplished.",

Pathological examination of myocardial biopsy samples (or autopsies) of patients with DCM frequently uncovers evidence of an inflammatory cell infiltrate and gene expression patterns compatible with immune cell activation 5, 63 . Immune cells that contribute to remodelling include mast cells, macrophages (M2 macrophages, also known as alternatively activated macrophages, and myeloidderived suppressor cells), T helper 2 (T H 2) and T H 17 cells and, in the case of autoimmune aetiologies, B cells that produce autoantibodies that form immune complexes with self-antigens and complement components 64, 65 . Immune cells release cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF\u03b21), IL-4, IL-1\u03b2, IL-17A, IL-33 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), among other mediators, that promote remodelling, collagen deposition and fibrosis [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . Fibrosis is a consequence of inflammation at the site of tissue damage and is the characteristic pathological feature of DCM aside from dilatation 8,62 . Regional dysfunction and/or volume overload lead to increased cardiac workload and wall stress, activation of fetal genes and myocyte reversion to fetal programming and myofibroblasts 63 ; these mechanisms are both a consequence and a cause of fibrosis. With time, fibrotic scar tissue eventually replaces the damaged tissue, thereby stiffening the heart and further amplifying the progression to dilation and heart failure.",

DCM probably represents the end result of more than one aetiological agent in each individual patient, in a multiple hit cascade involving gene-environment interactions 62 , which is best depicted by the application of a new complex classification -the MOGES 8, 98 , with cardiac \u03b1-myosin and \u03b2-myosin heavy-chain isoforms being frequently recognized autoantigens 83 . Some of these autoantibodies seem to have a direct functional pathogenetic role [102] [103] [104] ; furthermore, immunization of animals with autoantigens that have been identified in patients with DCM, such as \u03b2 1 -adrenergic receptor, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2, cardiac myosin heavy chain and cardiac troponins 79,86-91,105-107 , leads to cardiac abnormalities that reproduce the DCM phenotype. Of note, myocardial pathology has been produced by transfer of immune components from one experimental animal to another 8, 105, 108 . Passive transfer of antibodies purified from rats immunized with cardiac myosin leads to depo sition of antibodies in the myocardium and myocyte apoptosis, producing cardiomyopathy in recipient animals 88 . In a mouse model of autoimmune myocarditis and DCM induced by immunization with \u03b1-myosin heavy chain, TGF\u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1; also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7) mediated rapid Wnt protein secretion, resulting in TGF\u03b2mediated myofibroblast differentiation and myocardial fibrosis progression, suggesting a possible mechanism for autoimmunity in promoting remodelling that leads to DCM 109 .

Mutations in other non-contractile proteins (for example, a co-chaperone for heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and heat shock cognate 70 chaperone proteins, encoded by BAG3) may induce defects in cell signalling pathways that modify cardiac response 48, 224 . Mutations in phospholamban (encoded by PLN), a key calcium signalling protein, have been directly linked to abnormal contractility 225 . Variants in desmosomal proteins including desmin (encoded by DES) desmocollin 2 (encoded by DSC2), desmoglein 2 (encoded by DSG2), desmoplakin (encoded by DSP) and plakophilin 2 (encoded by PKP2) are most commonly associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy , but mutations in these genes have also been implicated in DCM 226 . In some patients with genetic DCM, a particular gene defect may be suggested by cardiac conduction abnormalities. For example, variants of lamin A/C (LMNA; which is part of a protein structure associated with the inner nuclear membrane) are associated with high rates of conduction system disease, ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death 41 .

More than 50% of children with cancer receive an anthracycline, resulting in >80% survival, but up to 60% develop at least some form of cardiac dysfunction that can lead to cardiomyocyte necrosis, apoptosis, hypertrophy, fibrosis, LV dysfunction, DCM and heart failure 123, 124 . Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) samples reveal features of cardiotoxicity, such as cytosolic vacuolization, lysis of myofibrils and cellular swelling. Troponin I, a marker of myocardial injury, is a useful serum biomarker of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity predicting progression to DCM 125 .",

Cardiac catheterization may be performed to rule out coexisting coronary artery disease, and cardiac MRI may assist with imaging dilatation and is used to determine the presence of oedema and/or fibrosis, which are suggestive of inflammation. Electrocardiography (ECG) in patients with DCM may be remarkably normal, but abnormalities ranging from isolated T wave changes and left bundle branch block to prolongation of atrioventricular conduction can occur. Sinus tachycardia and supraventricular arrhythmias are common; ~20-30% of patients have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Ambulatory Holter monitoring captures premature ventricular complex and sustained or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, both of which are important, especially in differential diagnosis with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. The diagnostic accuracy is dependent on the combination of conventional non-invasive and invasive cardiological examination with molecular and non-cardiac parameters including genetic analyses; this comprehensive approach is also needed to determine the aetiology of DCM. As described (see section on autoimmunity above), different serum autoantibodies to cardiac-specific and muscle-specific autoantigens have been found in myocarditis and autoimmune DCM, and some of these autoantibodies might have a direct pathogenetic role 8, 98, 102, 108, [142] [143] [144] .",

Thus, the basic evaluation of these patients should include a detailed family history as well as clinical screening of first-degree relatives. Next-generation sequencing methods, such as whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing, are emerging as moderately inexpensive approaches for diagnosis that have both clinical and research implications. Inherited cardiomyopathies, including DCM, are genetically heterogeneous and are associated with rare mutations in a large number of genes; many mutations result in similar phenotypes, and, therefore, the same phenotype can have different underlying mutations. Even in the absence of an identified pathogenetic mutation, first-degree relatives should have periodic ECG and echocardiography to detect early signs of DCM. In addition to genetic variation, numerous factors affect gene expression and, therefore, determine how gene mutations are manifested 146 . The genotype frequently does not equate to phenotype because of environmental epigenetic influences on gene expression. For example, mutations that promote cardiomyocyte damage recruit a pro-inflammatory response promoting remodelling and DCM 147 . Thus, assessment of familial DCM would bene fit from an improved understanding of the influence of environmental and epigenetic factors 148, 149 .",

MRI detects myocardial oedema suggestive of acute myocarditis or sarcoidosis (an inflammatory disease in which granulomas form in different organs). Alongside cardiac MRI, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET has emerged as a valuable tool for diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis. However, the sensitivity of cardiac MRI to detect inflammation in DCM is low because inflammation is scarce at this stage of the disease process. The best method to confirm the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate in DCM is histology and/or immunohistology 151 .

In each trial, CRT reduced the risk of the primary composite end point of death or heart failure hospitalization, with a 34% relative risk ratio in MADIT-CRT and a 25% relative risk ratio in RAFT. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced in RAFT but not in MADIT-CRT. CRT improves symptoms, QoL and ventricular function in these patient populations as well. Both MADIT-CRT and RAFT showed a significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction whereby QRS duration modified the treatment effect (CRT seemed more effective in patients with a QRS \u2265150 ms), and CRT was more beneficial for patients with left bundle branch block than for those with right bundle branch block or an interventricular conduction defect. In a meta-analysis, the mortality benefit of CRT was similar in individuals with ischaemic disease and nonischaemic cardiomyopathy 169 . Thus, for all these trials, CRT reduced risk of death and improved symptoms, QoL and ventricular function.",

Advances in echocardiography techniques and measurements (such as global longitudinal strain, tissue Doppler strain and speckletracking echocardiography) have the potential to enable much earlier detection of systolic dysfunction leading to DCM, especially if echocardiography results can be paired to serum biomarkers of heart failure such as BNP and pro-NT-BNP, soluble interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1R1; also known as sST2) and C-reactive protein (CRP) 189, 190 . Clinical management of a patient with symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy starts with standard heart failure medications. If there is haemodynamic improvement, the treatment will be continued with careful follow-up to monitor for progressive left ventricular dysfunction. If left ventricular dysfunction is noted or there is a lack of haemodynamic improvement, an endomyocardial biopsy should be performed. If viral infection is detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR or immunohistochemistry staining, the patient may receive antiviral therapy. If certain inflammatory cells are discovered, a tailored immunosuppressive therapy may be administered. If there is no haemodynamic improvement, additional treatment options for heart failure should be explored.

Mice lacking the T cell receptor co-stimulatory receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) spontaneously develop autoimmune DCM with autoantibodies that bind cardiac troponin I 106 . Passive transfer of monoclonal antibodies directed against cardiac troponin I induce cardiac dysfunction 107 . An antibody against cardiac troponin I was found in patients with myocarditis and DCM 215 , and the presence of this biomarker probably reflects damage to cardiac muscle 107 . Future experimental and clinical studies are needed to clarify the role of autoimmunity and autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of DCM because serum autoantibodies may form an inexpensive early screening method to determine a subset of patients at an increased risk of developing DCM. Clinical and animal studies are also needed to find novel therapies with improved efficacy and safety for cases of EMB-proven virus-negative autoimmune DCM with or without serum cardiac-specific autoantibodies.",

As care has improved in cardiovascular medicine, with improved reperfusion therapies, implantable defibrillators, novel medications and cardiac transplantation, mortality has decreased. Advances in this area are particularly important for DCM because the disease is often detected only at an end stage when the scar tissue is well established and is refractory to medication to reverse the process. Promising new tools include mesenchymal stem cells, purified platelet exosome products, fat-derived extracellular vesicles and others. Extracellular vesicles and the more-purified form termed exosomes derived from cells such as adipocytes or platelets of healthy individuals are important in cell-to-cell communication and have been found to contain many regulatory factors such as proteins, RNAs and lipids that inhibit pro-inflammatory and profibrotic pathology 216 . Although many of these therapies have yet to be applied to patients with DCM in the clinical setting, they hold the promise of a therapy that could prevent or reverse remodelling and promote cardiac regeneration 217, 218 .",

The 'defective force transmission' hypothesis postulates that the cytoskeleton provides an intracellular scaffolding that is important for transmission of force from the sarcomere to the extracellular matrix and for protection of the myocyte from external mechanical stress. Thus, defects in cytoskeletal proteins could predispose to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) by reducing force transmission and/or resistance to mechanical stress. Contractile dysfunction of myofibrils plays a central part in initiation and progression of DCM. The sarcomere is composed of numerous proteins, and mutations in several of them have been associated with DCM, including actin, \u03b1-cardiac muscle 1 (encoded by ACTC1), myosin-binding protein C, cardiac type (encoded by MYBPC3), myosin chains (encoded by MYL2, MYL3, MYH6 and MYH7) and tropomyosin-\u03b11 chain (encoded by TPM1) (see",
