Glycosylation of these proteins was observed to continue to the end of the experiment (28 hr postinoculation). Seven of these intracellular glycoproteins could also be detected in infected Trichoplusia ni TN-368 cells 24 hr postinoculation. When the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin was present (from 0 hr postinoculation) there was no detewtable glycosylation of any of these viral-induced glycoproteins. Metabolic labeling of the nonoccluded virus budded from IPLB-21 and TN-368 with tritiated mannose or N-acetylglucosamine identified 11 structural glycoproteins, 8 of which were identical in both virus preparations.",

            "text": "The occurrence of glycoproteins as structural components of enveloped viruses may well be universal (Patzer et aZ., 1979) . A variety of functions have been suggested for viral glycoproteins such as virus envelope acquisition (Payne and Kristensson, 1982; Simons and Garoff, 1980) , virus attachment (B&hi et &, lgi'i') , penetration (Little et al, 1981; Huang et al, 1980) , and uncoating (Lenard and Miller, 1982) . Recently, we demonstrated that the glycoproteins of the nonoccluded form of the Autographa califmica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) are necessary for the infection of Trichoplusia ni cells but not for the release of enveloped progeny virus (Stiles et aL, 1983a) . In spite of the importance of viral glycoproteins, little work has been done to characterize the glycoproteins of the insect pathogenic baculoviruses. To date, only four studies have appeared, three involving the structural glycoproteins of AcNPV (Maruniak, 1979; Dobos and Cochran, 1980; Goldstein and McIntosh, 1980) and the fourth dealing with the structural glycoproteins of the nonoccluded baculovirus, Hz-l (Burand et al, 1983) . The time sequence of intracellular viral-specific glycoprotein synthesis has not yet been determined for any baculovirus.",

The occluded virus was found to contain a single 42K structural glycoprotein which labeled with pH]Glc-NAc but not rH]man and was apparently resistant to the inhibitory effects of TM (Fig. 6) Iodinatim of viral envelope proteins. Figure 7 illustrates the pattern of surface envelope proteins of NOV and occluded AcNPV accessible to lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination. In control preparations without lactoperoxidase, there was a greater than 99% reduction in TCA-precipitable lzjI counts. We had previously determined (Stiles et al., 1983b ) that labeling of nucleocapsid proteins is negligible under these conditions. A total of 13 NOV surface envelope proteins were labeled on virus produced by TN-368 cells while 12 proteins were identified when virus was produced in IPLB-21 cells (Fig. 7) . A few additional bands were occasionally observed but not consistently enough to be included as viral proteins. These additional bands may represent contaminating cellular material. The asterisks beside certain of the proteins indicate envelope proteins which we had previously found to be glycosylated. The TN-368 cell derived nonoccluded virus contained a 1OOK molecular weight protein not seen in the IPLB-21 cell-derived virus. In addition, one viral protein (vp) band had a slightly different estimated molecular weight (vp 15 versus vp 14) from TN-368 and IPLB-21 cells, respectively. We also observed that the 38K viral glycoprotein which is present in NOV from both cell lines was surface labeled only in virus derived from IPLB-21 cells. Differences in protein glycosylation patterns may have blocked iodination of this glycoprotein in TN-368 cell-derived NOV. When iodination of the major surface proteins of TN-368 and IPLB-21 cells was performed, none of the host cell plasma membrane proteins observed (data not shown) matched the NOV proteins labeled in Fig. 7 . However, difficulties in iodinating cell surface proteins make it impossible to completely rule out the presence of host membrane proteins in the nonoccluded virus.",

When TM was present for more than 6 hr, it completely blocked the incorporation of label into virus protein bands (Fig. 1) indicating that metabolism of the labeled sugar was not significant under the stated experimental conditions. In addition, NOV pro-duced in the presence of TM from either IPLB-21 or TN-368 cells did not label with either sugar. The fact that all of the viralinduced glycoproteins were sensitive to TM indicates that they are glycosylated via iVglycosidic bonds.",

The other five viral proteins were observed to be glycosylated at approximately the same time as their synthesis was detected (identified with pS]methionine (Carstens et ul, 1979; Dobos and Cochran, 1980; Kelly and Lescott, 1981; Maruniak and Summers, 1981; Wood, 1980a) ). Following the virus development sequence scheme proposed by Wood (1980a) for AcNPV, four virus glycoproteins (87K, 75K, 67K, and 62K) were identified during the early phase (2 to 8 hr pi). The other five glycoproteins were first observed to be glycosylated during the intermediate phase (10 to 14 hr pi). A comparison of AcNPV intracellular glycoproteins produced in IPLB-21 cells with those produced in TN-368 cells at 24 hr pi (Fig. 3) showed that the glycoprotein patterns were identical except that 8'7K and 34K glycoproteins were not observed in TN-368 cells. The 87K glycoprotein may have been masked by a heavily labeled host glycoprotein which had approximately the same mobility. The 34K glycoprotein was a very minor glycoprotein in IPLB-21 cells and we may simply have failed to detect it in the TN-368 cells.",

In addition, there were a number of structural glycoproteins which were not identified in the intracellular experiments. This may have been due to masking by host cell glycoproteins of similar mobility, processing, or cleavage of some glycoproteins before their incorporation into virions, or they may represent a consistent contamination of NOV preparations by host cell glycoproteins, Differences were observed between the glycoproteins of NOV derived from the two cell lines. Several animal virus glycoproteins have been shown to have altered mobility in polyacrylamide gels when the virus was grown in different host cells (Etchison et &, 1981; Keegstra and Burke, 19'77; Simons and Garoff, 1980) . The virus apparently uses the host's unaltered glycosylation machinery; therefore, the same viral protein can undergo very different types of glycosylation depending upon the host cell. This may account for the differences observed here although we may also be dealing with some contaminating host cell glycoproteins.",

Goldstein and McIntosh (1980) reported observing one glycoprotein of an approximate molecular weight of 70K in NOV derived from either IPLB-21 or T. ni TN-CL1 cells. This glycoprotein undoubtedly corresponds to the vpg 67 iden-tified as the major structural glycoprotein in this study. Maruniak (1979) observed four high molecular weight vpg's which correspond to our vpg 115, vpg 85, vpg 82, and vpg 67. The lower molecular weight glycoproteins identified in this study were not reported by Maruniak. Possibly our procedure of adding label to infected cells at 10 hr pi after the virus has begun to suppress the host cell synthesis (Carstens et al, 1979 ) rather than at 0 hr pi (as did Maruniak (1979)) produces a more efficient labeling of the minor viral glycoproteins.",

            "text": "When attempts were made to label the occluded virus glycoproteins, a single 42,000 molecular weight band was observed only after labeling with N-acetylglucosamine (it did not label with mannose). This glycoprotein was also insensitive to TM treatment. We cannot at this time rule out the possibility that the 4-day labeling period used allowed the label to be metabolized and selectively incorporated into this structural protein. However, the fact that we did not see significant label transfer following shorter label periods and that the label showed up in a single occluded virus band suggests to us that this is a glycoprotein. In addition, its insensitivity to TM treatment and failure to label with [\"HIman is presumptive evidence that this glycoprotein contains 0-glycosidic bonds (mannose is generally not present in Oglycosidic glycoproteins- Niemann and Klenk (1981) ). These data are consistent with the unaltered infectivity of AcNPV OBs produced in the presence of TM (Stiles et UC, 1983a) . 0-Glycosidic glycoproteins have been detected in several other animal viruses (Holmes et al, 1981; Niemann and Klenk, 1981; Shida and Dales, 1981) . Maruniak (1979) and Dobos and Cochran (1980) reported 14 vpg's and 6 vpg's, respectively, in occluded AcNPV. In both studies the major vpg had a molecular weight of approximately 42K and was not labeled by [3H]man. The minor vpg's may have been detected because these authors added the tritiated sugars at 0 hr pi. However, this may also have allowed sufficient opportunity for the sugars to be metabolized before being incorporated into the virus proteins. Interpretation of the results from Dobos and Cochran (1980) are complicated by the fact that they added a small proportion of insect-derived occlusion bodies containing an alkaline protease to aid in the release of the virus from the occlusion body matrix protein, which may account for the smaller number of glycoproteins than reported by Maruniak. It has since been demonstrated that the occlusion-body-associated alkaline protease causes pronounced changes in the pattern of baculovirus structural (Wood, 1980a) and envelope proteins (Stiles et cd, 1983b).",
