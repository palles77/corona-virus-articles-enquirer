When high levels are present, kittens are protected against disease and develop subclinical infection leading to latency; in the absence of sufficient MDA, they may develop clinical signs. 4 In healthy small populations, the prevalence of viral shedding may be lower than 1%, and in large populations, especially when clinical signs are present, it may reach 20%. [5] [6] [7] This low prevalence probably reflects the intermittent nature of viral shedding during latency. In shelters, risks are higher: with 4% of shedders entering the shelter, 50% of cats may excrete the virus 1 week later. 8 ",

Antibody may persist for up to 10 weeks, but in some studies about 25% of the kittens became MDA-negative at only 6 weeks of age. 10, 11 Active immune response Natural FHV infection does not result in solid immunity as seen, for example, in feline panleukopenia virus infections. In general, the immune response protects against disease, but not against infection, and mild clinical signs have been observed following reinfection only 150 days after primary infection. Virus neutralising antibody (VNA) titres are often low and rise slowly -they may still be absent 40 days after infection. 12 It is likely that VNA neutralises incoming virus during acute infection, and contributes to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-induced complement lysis. 13 As with other alphaherpesviruses, cellmediated immunity plays a very important role in protection, since vaccinated cats without detectable antibody are not necessarily susceptible to disease. By contrast, seroconversion has been shown to correlate with protection against virulent FHV challenge. 14 In these cases, antibodies may serve as an indicator of cellular immune responses, since T lymphocytes are required for the maintenance of B lymphocyte function. Since FHV is a pathogen of the respiratory tract, mucosal cellular and humoral responses are significant. 15 Although a correlation exists between FHV antibodies and protection against clinical signs, there is no test available to predict protection in individual cats.",

Experimental evidence suggests that stromal keratitis with corneal oedema, inflammatory cell infiltrates, vascularisation and eventually blindness are the result of this pathogenic mechanism. 16 Corneal sequestra and eosinophilic keratitis have been linked to the presence of FHV in the cornea and/or blood, but some affected cats have been found to be virus-negative. 18 Viral DNA has also been detected in the aqueous humour of a larger proportion of cats suffering from uveitis, as compared with 19 Chronic rhinosinusitis, a frequent cause of sneezing and nasal discharge, has been associated with FHV infection. Viral DNA is detected in some affected cats, but is also found in control animals. 20 The virus does not replicate, suggesting that chronic rhinosinusitis is initiated by FHV infection and perpetuated by immune-mediated mechanisms. Inflammation and remodelling then lead to the permanent destruction of nasal turbinates and bone, complicated by secondary bacterial infection. 21 Often, FHV infection occurs in combination with feline calicivirus (FCV) and/or Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma species, Staphylococcus species or Escherichia coli infection, causing a multi-agent respiratory syndrome. 1",

This article uses EBM ranking to grade the level of evidence of statements in relevant sections on diagnosis, disease management and control, as well as vaccination. Statements are graded on a scale of I to IV as follows: \u271c EBM grade I This is the best evidence, comprising data obtained from properly designed, randomised controlled clinical trials in the target species (in this context cats); \u271c EBM grade II Data obtained from properly designed, randomised controlled studies in the target species with spontaneous disease in an experimental setting; \u271c EBM grade III Data based on non-randomised clinical trials, multiple case series, other experimental studies, and dramatic results from uncontrolled studies; \u271c EBM grade IV Expert opinion, case reports, studies in other species, pathophysiological justification. If no grade is specified, the EBM level is grade IV.Further reading Roudebush P, Allen TA, Dodd CE, Novotny BJ. Application of evidence-based medicine to veterinary clinical nutrition.

            "text": "Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) positive catsHealthy FeLV-or FIV-positive cats should be protected against rhinotracheitis. As indoor confinement is often impossible, vaccination is required. Concerns that vaccination may contribute to FIV disease progression are outweighed by the benefits of protection against upper respiratory disease; indeed, other infections may also contribute to FIV progression. Vaccination should be considered for FIV-seropositive cats with a history of respiratory problems, provided the animals are in a stable condition. For sick cats with FIV-related disease, vaccination is discouraged, as in any systemically ill cat. \u271c Cats with chronic disease Booster vaccination should be continued in (often elderly) cats with stable chronic medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and renal disease.\u271c Cats receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs Depending on dosage and length of treatment, corticosteroids cause immune suppression, and concurrent use of corticosteroids at the time of vaccination should be avoided. \u271c Feline viral rhinotracheitis is caused by feline herpesvirus (FHV). \u271c In most cats, FHV remains latent after recovery, and they become lifelong virus carriers. \u271c Due to the highly contagious nature of FHV, infection and disease are common in multi-cat situations such as boarding and breeding catteries, shelters and multi-cat households. \u271c FHV infections cause acute rhinitis and conjunctivitis, usually accompanied by fever, depression and anorexia. \u271c Affected cats may also develop typical ulcerative, dendritic keratitis. \u271c Positive PCR results should be interpreted with caution, as they may be due to low-level shedding or viral latency. \u271c Supportive therapy and good nursing care are essential. \u271c Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given to prevent secondary bacterial infections. \u271c Topical antiviral drugs may be used for the treatment of acute FHV ocular disease. \u271c Two vaccine injections, at 9 and 12 weeks of age, are recommended, and a first booster 1 year later. \u271c Adult cats with an unknown or uncertain vaccination status should also receive two doses at an interval of 2-4 weeks. \u271c Boosters should be given at yearly intervals to at-risk cats. \u271c For cats in low-risk situations (eg, indoor-only cats), 3-yearly booster intervals suffice.
