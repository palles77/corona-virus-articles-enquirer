            "text": "Population-based respiratory research and vaccine efficacy studies have previously required clinic or home visits when a subject had an acute respiratory illness. This method may mean parents are unwilling to enrol their child or report an illness of interest. We conducted a community-based cohort study into respiratory illnesses in 234 pre-school aged children using parent-collected specimens. Between January 2003 and January 2004 there were 563 specimens collected from 730 identified illnesses and these were tested using a panel of respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays; 409 (73%) were positive for any virus. Specimens were not more likely to be positive when collected by a healthcare worker parent, when they included a throat swab, or when a very good collection technique was reported. A delay from illness onset to specimen collection of up to 5 days did not appear to impact on sensitivity of virus identification, but a delay of six or more days with minor delays in testing saw positivity fall. Combined with daily symptom diary completion and PCR testing, parent-collected specimens are an efficient and acceptable method for the conduct of future vaccine efficacy studies and other community-based respiratory virus research.",

The offer of graduated support at the time of NTS collection was also made: beginning initially with further instruction and support over the telephone, stepping up to a research assistant visiting the home to supervise parent collection, and failing that, having the research assistant visit to collect the specimen. During the course of the study, telephone support was only occasionally provided, usually when a parent was collecting the first specimen after an extended period since the enrolment visit.

Both the VTM and ice-brick were stored in the household freezer. Collecting the nasal swab involved rubbing a single swab against the internal anterior walls of both nostrils. We anticipated that there may be situations where parents might be reluctant to collect a throat swab or have difficulty doing so. At the enrolment visit we asked that parents make a reasonable attempt to collect a throat swab for every ARI. We asked the throat swab be collected after the nasal swab as we perceived this to be the more difficult specimen to collect and that failure to secure an adequate throat swab specimen as the first specimen might result in the subject becoming distressed and refusing further intervention. We acknowledged that it would not always be possible to collect an NTS and let parents know we would accept a nose-only swab, and provided a check box on the request slip to inform us of specimen type, consisting of a combined nose-throat swab or a nose-only swab. Also on the request slip we asked parents to subjectively rate their collection technique as very good, good, or poor. Both the nose and throat swab were pooled in the single VTM tube. The VTM and request form were put in a sealed plastic biohazard bag and placed with an ice-brick in the esky for collection. The esky was couriered initially to VIDRL for virus testing and then transported at study end to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases (Qpid) Laboratory where they were further tested for a number of respiratory viruses (Table 3 ) as described previously [4] . Some parents provided more than one specimen for an ARI. All specimens tested and reported in this manuscript were collected during an illness that met the ARI definition; there were no asymptomatic control specimens collected from study subjects. ",

When parents were asked whether they would enrol their child into a hypothetical vaccine study using similar methods to ReVS (daily symptom diary and NTS collection): 35% said yes without qualification; 45% said they would consider it, but would need to hear more about the study before deciding; the remaining 20% said no, either because they were not happy for their child to receive an experimental vaccine (13%), were not happy to collect daily symptoms and specimens (3%), or were not happy to have an experimental vaccine, nor collect daily symptoms and specimens (4%).",

            "text": "The positivity rate of parent-collected swabs was not affected by whether the collector worked in a healthrelated field or the collector's perception of collection quality. Interestingly, including a throat swab did not increase the overall virus positivity. Ours was not a simultaneous, head-to-head comparison of nose-only versus nose-throat swabs, but in this setting, nose-only specimens had a higher rate of positivity (78% vs. 71%), although this difference was not significant. This finding may have been confounded by illness severity and virus shedding. A child with more severe illness may have been shedding more virus at the time of specimen collection, and in these children parents may have been less likely to attempt collection of the additionally invasive throat specimen. The only viral group where throat swabs appeared to improve detection was the adenoviruses, where a throat swab may have been more likely to capture adenoviral persistence in the oropharynx rather than acute infection, particularly in the age group under study [9] . A recent study showed that detecting adenoviral persistence 1-12 weeks after initial positivity was not possible using nose swabs alone in children 6 months to 4 years of age [10] . In our study, a delay from illness onset to specimen collection of up to 5 days did not appear to lower positivity using our method of couriering specimens from a subject's home to a central laboratory for PCR testing. The delay from collection to testing is more difficult to interpret, but it appears that six or more days delay from onset to collection combined with even minor delays in testing are not optimal for virus identification.",

            "text": "In the past, using antigen-based techniques for respiratory syncytial virus diagnosis, nasal, throat, and nasopharyngeal swabs have not performed as well as nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) or nasal washes, with a reduction in sensitivity of up to one-third [11] . In our study, the use of PCR and collection of specimens in the early stages of illness may have minimised differences caused by site of collection, with nose-only swabs performing as well as throat swabs for virus positivity. Our rate for detection of any virus in all specimens compares favourably with other recent community-based studies using molecular methods [12, 13] , and these values are similar to hospital-based findings using mainly NPAs and a comprehensive panel of respiratory virus PCR assays [14] . Ideally, future research should attempt a direct comparison of NPAs to parent-collected specimens to quantify any loss of sensitivity using this method. A recent report has shown increased return of cells using flocked swabs to collect a specimen from either the nasopharynx or the nose; but subjects reported a non-statistically significant higher pain score for use of a flocked nasopharyngeal swab compared with a rayon swab (100 mm visual analog scale for pain: 61.5 vs. 43.8 mm, p = 0.06) [15] . Flocked swabs were not available when we commenced this study, however, we do not believe parents would be comfortable in the collection of the more invasive and potentially more uncomfortable nasopharyngeal specimen either using a flocked swab or a standard swab at home in a study subject. The use of molecular methods for virus detection may also make any improvement in sensitivity for virus detection, using a flocked swab over an NTS, from the nasopharynx over an NTS or a nose-only swab, marginal. This is the first large-scale implementation of a community-based study reliant on parents collecting respi-ratory specimens. Parents were generally positively disposed to the study, and it is of interest that a high proportion of all study families reported they would have been happy to continue for another year. The most difficult part of the study was reported as being the collection of a throat specimen from an ill study child, but, based on the swab positivity results for all but adenoviruses, it may not be required--a well collected nose swab may suffice. Use of this method for experimental studies should be considered, and it is of interest that 80% of questionnaire respondents would have been happy to consider involvement in a hypothetical respiratory virus vaccine study using the same procedures as ReVS. Modifications to the protocol could make the current method simpler and more efficient, depending on study requirements. These could include using dry swabs for specimen collection to avoid the need for viral transport media to be stored in a subject's home, transporting dry swabs through the mail to reduce the reliance on more expensive couriers, and a heightened focus on diary completion, return, and specimen collection to minimise information bias. The high proportion of self-collected specimens from household contacts also demonstrates that the method could be expanded to include all ages, which would allow for contemporary household transmission studies to be performed using modern molecular testing methods.",
