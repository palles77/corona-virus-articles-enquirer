In this study, a subunit vaccine formulation containing only recombinant, soluble, attachment glycoprotein from HeV (sG HeV ) and CpG adjuvant was evaluated as a potential NiV vaccine in the cat model. Different amounts of sG HeV were employed and sG-induced immunity was examined. Vaccinated animals demonstrated varying levels of NiV-specific Ig systemically and importantly, all vaccinated cats possessed antigen-specific IgA on the mucosa. Upon oronasal challenge with NiV (50,000 TCID 50 ), all vaccinated animals were protected from disease although virus was detected on day 21 post-challenge in one animal. The ability to elicit protective systemic and mucosal immunity in this animal model provides significant progress towards the development of a human subunit vaccine against henipaviruses.",

Flying foxes in the genus Pteropus are considered to be the natural reservoir for both viruses and their geographic distribution encompasses all locations where HeV and NiV outbreaks have occurred [1, 2] . HeV has appeared sporadically in Australia since 1994 where infection has been predominantly in horses, although human infection has also occurred (reviewed in Ref. [3] ). Of the two reported fatal human cases, one presented with severe respiratory disease while the other succumbed to encephalitis. Recent outbreaks where horse fatalities were documented include 1999, 2004, 2006 and 2007 and one human case was reported in 2004 [4] [5] [6] [7] . The first NiV outbreak occurred in peninsular Malaysia and Singapore in [1998] [1999] where the majority of infections were in pigs with subsequent transmission to humans (reviewed in Refs. [8, 9] ). Humans developed severe febrile encephalitis with high case fatality and 25% of cases also exhibited respiratory signs. NiV has re-emerged repeat-edly since 1998: twice in Bangladesh and India in 2001, four times in Bangladesh in 2003, 2004 and 2005 , and most recently in 2007 in India and Bangladesh [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . These more recent outbreaks have included a higher incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in conjunction with encephalitis, epidemiological findings consistent with person-to-person transmission [15] , and apparent higher case fatality rates (\u223c75%). Furthermore, direct transmission of NiV from flying foxes to humans has been suggested [11, 16] .",

Classified as zoonotic biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) agents, both viruses have also been included among the pathogenic agents of biodefense concern by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) mainly due to their accessibility in the environment and their relative ease of propagation and dissemination. Currently there are no vaccines available for preventing NiV or HeV infection. As BSL-4 agents, human efficacy studies for testing potential henipavirus therapeutic products are not easily achievable; however, henipavirus animal disease models have been developed (reviewed in Ref. [18] ). As HeV and NiV are closely related, the development of one cross-reactive vaccine would be ideal for protection against infection by either virus.",

            "text": "Paramyxoviruses are large, enveloped, negative-sense ssRNA viruses [19] . Entry of paramyxoviruses into host cells is a two-step process mediated by the attachment glycoprotein which binds the host receptor, and the fusion (F) glycoprotein which drives virushost cell membrane merger [19] . For HeV and NiV, the attachment glycoprotein (G) lacks haemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities and the F glycoprotein is a typical class I fusion glycoprotein (reviewed in Ref. [20] ). For paramyxoviruses, the majority of neutralising antibody is elicited against the envelope glycoproteins in an infected host [19] . Furthermore, neutralising antibodies are the key vaccine-induced protective mechanisms for the human paramyxoviruses mumps and MeV [21, 22] . Three approaches have emerged for henipavirus vaccine development and all incorporate one or both of the henipavirus envelope glycoproteins (reviewed in Ref. [18] ). Recombinant vaccinia and canarypox viruses encoding either NiV F or G were shown to protect against NiV challenge in golden hamsters and pigs, respectively [23, 24] . Recombinant HeV and NiV G (sG HeV and sG NiV , respectively) were used as subunit vaccines in a cat NiV challenge model and all animals were protected from disease [25] . Although either sG HeV or sG NiV was able to protect against NiV, sG HeV elicited a higher-titre crossreactive henipavirus immune response. Recent serological studies have also suggested that a more cross-reactive henipavirus immune response is generated upon infection by HeV as compared to NiV [26] . Together, both data sets suggest that a HeV-derived vaccine would protect against challenge with either virus. Here we describe a vaccination and challenge trial in cats using a new sG subunit vaccine formulation where varying doses of sG HeV were used as the vaccine immunogen and small CpG DNA molecules were used as the adjuvant. All vaccinated animals were challenged oronasally with a high dose of a low passage NiV isolate. Pre-and post-challenge immune responses were examined and our data indicated that this new subunit vaccine formulation induced systemic as well as mucosal immunity. Viral loads were significantly reduced in vaccinated animals as compared to adjuvant alone control animals and all vaccinated animals were protected from NiV-mediated disease.",

The animal husbandry methods and experimental design were endorsed by the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory's Animal Ethics Committee. Animals were allowed to free roam in a single room during the vaccination phase of the study (day 1-day 39) and were subsequently relocated to individual cages in a single room at BSL-4 for the remainder of the experiment. Individual cage size and environmental conditions were as previously described [25] . All animals were within visual and auditory contact of each other and were fed twice daily with a complete premium dry food and provided with water ad lib. The BSL-4 room was fitted with a surveillance camera which allowed regular monitoring of the animals. For collection of all specimens, cats were anaesthetised as previously described [25] . Tracheobronchial washes were taken from the cats by the endotracheal tube method [27] with the cat in sternal recumbency and the head held up. Following laryngeal de-sensitisation with anaesthetic spray (Cophenylcaine Forte, ENT Technologies, Melbourne, VIC, Australia), the cat was intubated and a sterile dog urinary catheter (size 6 French) was gently inserted through the endotracheal tube as far as it would go. Via attached syringe, 5 ml of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was instilled into the catheter and immediately aspirated. Usu-ally the aspirate contained floccules of mucus and the procedure was deemed successful. If no mucus was present in the aspirate the procedure was repeated once. Anesthetic reversal was done as previously described [25] . Staff wore fully encapsulated suits with breathing apparatus while in the BSL-4 animal room or BSL-4 laboratory. Serum neutralisation tests, virus isolations and the initial stages of RNA extraction and post-challenge ELISA (Ig and cytokine) were carried out at BSL-4.",

IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-\u2425 standard concentrations ranged from 16 ng/ml to 0.125 ng/ml; IL-10 standard concentrations ranged from 8 ng/well to 0.0625 ng/ml. Cytokine standards, plasma samples, mucosal washes and tissue homogenates were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. Plates were washed three times with PBST. Biotinylated goat anti-canine IL-2 (1:500), biotinylated goat anti-feline IL-4 (1:500), biotinylated goat anti-feline IL-10 (1:500), or biotinylated goat anti-feline IFN-\u2425 (1:500) were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. Plates were washed three times with PBST and subsequently fixed in ice-cold absolute methanol for at least 20 min prior to air-drying outside the BSL-4 laboratory. Plates were washed three times with PBST. Streptavidin-HRP (1:200) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. Plates were washed three times with PBST and developed with a TMB substrate (Sigma). The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm. Pre-challenge plasma samples and mucosal washes were not tested in the BSL-4 laboratory; therefore, for these samples and the corresponding standard curves, a methanol fixation step was not done.",

All animals survived and virus was not recovered at any time point post-challenge suggesting sterilising immunity. Here we sought to better assess sG-specific immune responses thus a new vaccine trial was devised that employed varying doses of sG HeV . Additionally, as HeV and NiV replicate and cause severe pathology in the lung, CpG adjuvant was included in an attempt to elicit mucosal immunity. Eight adult cats were immunised as described in the methods and a schematic diagram outlining vaccination, specimen collection and NiV challenge is shown in Fig. 1 . Each animal received one prime and one boost intramuscularly over a 21-day period. Animals were bled and plasma antibody responses, specific for either sG HeV or sG NiV , were measured and results are shown in Fig. 2 . As expected, for all cats, regardless of Ig subclass, sG HeV -specific antibody levels were slightly higher than those specific for sG NiV . All cats had significant levels of IgG on day 21 which further increased upon boost (day 35) and there did not appear to be notable differences among different vaccine doses. Plasma IgM levels varied, and although all cats demonstrated sG HeV -specific IgM, only cat 29 (50 g dose) (cat 29-50) and cat 32 (25 g dose) (cat 32-25) demonstrated increased levels of sG NiV -specific IgM. Unlike IgG responses, IgM levels appeared to decrease upon boost. Significant levels of plasma IgA were detected in cat 29-50 and levels decreased upon boost; whereas cat 33 (5 g dose) (cat 33-5) appeared to have a slight increase in IgA upon boost. All plasma samples were further evalu-ated in NiV serum neutralisation tests (SNT) and results are shown in Table 1 . Most of the animals had low levels of neutralising antibody 21 days after prime and cat 34 (5 g dose) (cat , like the two adjuvant-only controls (cat 27-0 and cat 28-0), was negative. Upon boosting, SNT titre increased for all animals. No large differences in titre were observed between the cats vaccinated with 50 or 25 g; although the male cats had a slightly higher titre than the females. SNT titres were lower in the animals that received 5 g of sG HeV . All cats demonstrated higher SNT titres to HeV, and those animals that received 5 g sG HeV again exhibited the lowest SNT titres (data not shown). To determine if vaccination targeted mucosal surfaces, tracheobronchial washes were collected and sG HeV -specific secretory IgA was measured and results are shown in Fig. 3 . All cats had increased levels of mucosal IgA compared with day 0. Cat 29-50, cat 30 (50 g dose) (cat 30-50) and cat 32-25 had lower secretory IgA levels demonstrating that higher vaccine dose did not generate the highest mucosal antibody response. Additionally of these three animals, the two females, cats 30-50 and 32-25, had the lowest amount of mucosal IgA. IgM was not detected in mucosal washes (Fig. 3) .",

Oronasal challenge was used to mimic a more natural route of infection. By 7 days post-infection (dpi), the two control animals, cats 27-0 and 28-0, developed an acute febrile disease (>39 \u2022 C) comparable to that seen previously in experimental infection of cats given 50,000 TCID 50 NiV orally and intranasally [30] . The rise in temperature observed in both animals preceded an increase in respiratory rate by approximately 24 h (data not shown), as expected based on prior studies [25] . A rise in cumulative daily clinical scores was observed in parallel to the increase in respiratory rate (data not shown). For welfare reasons, cats were not allowed to progress to serious clinical disease and the control animals were euthanised 9 dpi. On necropsy examination the only grossly visible change was a discrete reddened lesion at the margin of the lung tissue of one control animal (cat 28-0). On microscopic examination both control animals had multiple foci of necrotising alveolitis in the lung parenchyma. Cat 28-0 had an advanced lesion at the margin of the lung, which consisted of alveolar necrosis, interstitial inflammatory infiltration predominantly with neutrophils, and necrotising bronchiolitis. Affected bronchiole and alveolar epithelium consisted of swollen cells or fused multinucleate cells (syncytia). The affected epithelial cells had frequent eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Fig. 4A) . The bronchial lymph node of cat 28-0 had sub-capsular focal necrosis, with small numbers of syncytia. Both spleens had multiple foci of necrosis affecting the red pulp and splenic nodules. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmic antigen staining was present in affected bronchiole and alveolar epithelium of both control cats (Fig. 4B) , and within the lymph node lesion. Conversely, all vaccinated cats did not demonstrate any clinical signs of NiV-mediated disease and survived until euthanasia on 21 dpi. Body temperature rose gradually only in cat 33-5 over the course of infection, however, no other clinical signs of disease were present. Upon post-mortem examination, significant lesions and viral antigen were not detected in any of the six vaccinated cats (data not shown).",

Such a large increase in titre most likely represented an increased immune response to replicating NiV. To determine if mucosal Ig levels changed post-challenge, tracheobronchial washes collected 8 dpi, 13 dpi and 21 dpi were evaluated for sG-specific IgA and IgM. As was seen pre-challenge, IgM was not detected in mucosal washes (data not shown). Conversely, measurable IgA was detected in most animals post-challenge and results are shown in Fig. 6 .

            "text": "To ascertain NiV tropism and shedding post-challenge, blood, oral swabs, urine and tissues were collected from the cats. Samples were initially screened using a quantitative Taqman PCR assay that targets NiV RNA in the nucleoprotein gene coding region. Previous studies in cats have demonstrated that detection of NiV genome by Taqman PCR, particularly in blood, oral swabs and urine, was a more sensitive assay than virus isolation [25] . In the present study, NiV genome was not detected in blood samples from any animal at any time point (data not shown). NiV genome was detected in oral swabs from all cats post-challenge and results are shown in Fig. 7A . The highest level of apparent shedding occurred on 6 dpi and 8 dpi. Cats 32-25, 33-5 and 34-5 appeared to shed virus at low levels until 21 dpi consistent with post-challenge SNT data, which suggested an increased immune response to replicating virus in these animals. Virus isolation was attempted on all NiV genome positive oral swabs; unfortunately cell toxicity in all samples precluded any successful isolation. Urine samples were collected opportunistically from cats post-challenge, assayed using Taqman PCR and results are shown in Fig. 7B . Similar to the swab data, the highest level of apparent shedding in urine occurred at 6 dpi and 8 dpi. When virus isolation was attempted, all urine samples were negative but again, variable successful isolation of NiV from urine samples of infected cats has been reported [25, 30] . Although based on Taqman PCR, not virus isolation, these data suggest that all cats shed significant amounts of NiV following challenge. The data from 6 dpi and 8 dpi may have represented clearance of the initial inoculum, not replicating virus; however, the detection of NiV genome in urine and in swabs from low dose cats on 21 dpi was perhaps a stronger indication of replicating virus in these animals, despite the failure of virus isolation. Tissues collected upon euthanasia were also assayed for viral RNA and results are shown in Fig. 8 . Similar to previous studies of NiV infection in cats, both control cats (27-0 and 28-0) had significant amounts of NiV genome in a wide range of tissues, with the highest levels present in the lung and spleen (Fig. 8A) . Virus isolation was conducted on all tissues that were positive for the presence of NiV genome; however, virus was only isolated from lung and spleen. The majority of tissues assayed from vaccinated cats at day 21 were negative for NiV genome; however significant levels of genome were detected in the brain (Fig. 8B) . Unexpectedly, cats 29-50, 30-50 and 31-25 demonstrated the highest level of genome in brain tissues, and levels were significantly higher than those seen in the control cats. Virus isolation confirmed the presence of NiV in cat 31-25 brain-olfactory whereas for cats 29-50 and 30-50, no virus was isolated. No viral antigen was detected in any of the brains by immunohistochemistry. Clearly, for all vaccinated animals, systemic NiV-mediated disease and multiple organ system pathology was reduced almost entirely. As an exception, NiV genome was detected in the brain of several animals and the significance of these data remains to be elucidated.",

Here, we have conducted a second sG-henipavirus vaccine trial in cats to further progress a human henipavirus vaccine candidate. As person-to-person transmission of NiV has occurred in recent outbreaks, a vaccine may prove useful in future outbreaks to decrease transmission. Additionally, a henipavirus vaccine would be beneficial to BSL-4 laboratory staff and first responders who may encounter a deliberate misuse of either virus. As HeV and NiV are BSL-4 pathogens, human efficacy studies are not permitted during vaccine development; however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has implemented the Animal Efficacy Rule for the evaluation of therapeutic products under these circumstances. Specifically, FDA can rely on evidence derived from animal studies in the evaluation of product effectiveness. However, a well-understood mechanism for the pathogenicity of the agent in conjunction with the underlying mechanism of action of the product must be documented. In previous studies, we documented the mechanism for the pathogenicity of the agent and demonstrated protection from NiV challenge in cats using recombinant sG subunit vaccines. Our studies suggested that vaccinated animals developed sterilising immunity [25] . Here we have completed a second sG vaccine trial aimed at influencing and understanding, in a more detailed manner, the mechanism of sG-induced immunity. A CpG motif adjuvant which had been employed previously in humans [31] [32] [33] and was known to stimulate mucosal and Th1 immunity [34] [35] [36] was utilized. Varying doses of sG and a minimum immunisation regimen of one prime and one boost were employed with the goal of eliciting a range of humoral immune responses. Finally, unlike the previous sG vaccine trial, where only 500 TCID 50 was employed subcutaneously, in this study a high NiV challenge dose was employed and administered oronasally, a route of challenge that more closely mimicked a natural infection.",

IgM and IgA levels varied according to vaccine dose which suggested subtle differences in the potency of the immune response in vaccinated animals. A significant percentage of antigen-specific Ig had neutralising capability, as demonstrated by SNT titre. Mucosal IgA was detected in all vaccinated animals suggesting that CpG adjuvant helped target the immune response to the mucosa; however, IgA levels did not correlate with vaccine dose. The absolute level of plasma Ig did not vary greatly post-challenge. SNT titres did increase in three of the lowest dose cats suggesting virus replication did occur. The observed differences between increased SNT titre post-challenge and relatively unchanged levels of sG-specific plasma Ig might represent antibody responses directed at other viral proteins besides the attachment glycoprotein. Equally possible, although sG-specific antibodies did not increase, an increase in sG-specific antibody affinity could have led to increased potencies in SNT. The combination of sG HeV and CpG induced sufficient levels of antigen-specific plasma Ig, neutralising antibodies and antigenspecific mucosal IgA to protect all cats from lethal NiV challenge.",

To be thorough, plasma, mucosal washes and tissue homogenates from the lung, spleen and bronchial lymph nodes were tested. Unlike other highly pathogenic human viral respiratory pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), RSV, and highly pathogenic influenza virus, a cytokine storm does not appear to play a role in the early stages of NiV-mediated disease.

            "text": "To indirectly measure the effects of vaccine-induced immunity, we assessed viral shedding, viral loads and NiV-associated pathology in cats post-challenge. Prolonged apparent viral shedding was demonstrated in oral swabs from three of the vaccinated cats. In all vaccinated animals, systemic NiV-mediated disease was practically negated as evidenced by the lack of clinical disease and gross or microscopic pathology, the absence of immunohistochemical antigen staining and minimal detection of NiV genome in various tissues. Surprisingly, although no viral antigen was detected in any of the brain tissues from vaccinated animals, relatively high amounts of NiV genome were detected in the brain of four of the higher vaccine dose cats. NiV was isolated from one brain tissue confirming the presence of infectious virus. In the two low vaccine dose animals, which had the lowest pre-challenge SNT titres, the level of NiV genome in the brain was either undetectable or just barely above the threshold of the assay. Notably, all the vaccinated cats that demonstrated NiV genome in the brain had significant antibody titres prior to challenge. These observations indicate that persistent infection of NiV in cats may occur despite the presence of pre-existing immunity and that persistent infection may even be enhanced by particular levels of immunity. The mechanisms of this effect are unclear and require further investigation. Due to the constraints with working at BSL4 only small numbers of cats were used. It would be useful to strengthen the statistical significance of these findings by repeating similar trials, and thereby increasing the numbers of infected animals. The data suggest that although protection from disease was achieved in the current vaccine study, the antigen dose used was not sufficient to prevent virus from infecting the brain. What remains unknown is whether the NiV detected within the brain of some animals would eventually be cleared by the host or if neurological disease would manifest at a later date. However, considering the significantly longer periods that such recurrences of disease have been documented to occur in humans (ranging from several months to nearly 4 years) [37] , such long-term studies are nearly impossible to conduct under BSL-4 containment.",
