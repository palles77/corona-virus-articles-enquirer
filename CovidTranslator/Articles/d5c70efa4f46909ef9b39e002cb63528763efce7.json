At each office visit, a complete physical examination is performed. Specific notes regarding the animal's general condition, mentation, posture, locomotion, and breathing pattern are made. Next, the body temperature, respiratory and heart rates, capillary refill time, and body weight (expressed in pounds, kilograms, or grams) of the puppy are noted. The thorax is then thoroughly auscultated and the abdomen palpated for evidence of physical abnormalities. Body weights are always recorded for a couple of reasons. First, body weight provides information needed for dispensing medication, and second, it is an immediate indicator of the growth rate of the puppy. The body weight of a growing puppy should steadily increase at each office visit and 74 is an indication that the puppy is receiving adequate nutrition.",

Each gene generally occupies a particular position within a particular chromosome.

That is, the DNA test results should never change with age and should be the same whenever it is repeated. Dog breeders and veterinarians alike can separate the problem of some inherited diseases into two distinct issues: getting rid of the disease and getting rid of the defective gene. There are three possible DNA testing results obtained: Clear, Carrier, and Affected. A Clear finding indicates that the gene is not present in the tested dog. Therefore, when used for breeding purposes, Clear dogs will not pass on the disease gene. A Carrier finding indicates that one copy of the disease gene is present in the tested dog and that it is not likely to exhibit signs of the disease. Carrier dogs will probably not have medical problems as a result. Dogs with the Carrier status will not develop the medical problems and will pass on the disease gene 50% of the time. An Affected finding indicates that two copies of the disease gene are present in the tested dog, and the disease will medically affect the dog. It is always best to breed \"Clear dog to Clear dog.\" If followed by the pedigree dog breeders, this strategy should ensure a significant reduction in the frequency of the targeted disease gene in future generations of dogs.
