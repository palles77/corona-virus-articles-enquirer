We detected this virus by PCR in ten (8%) of 132 consecutive children admitted to Turku Hospital, Finland, for acute expiratory wheezing (median age 7 months, range 4-25). The mean duration of hospital stay was 2\u00b75 days (SD 1\u00b76) and mean duration of respiratory symptoms was 19 days (8). The white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and regulated upon activation, normal T-cell-expressed and T-cell-secreted (RANTES) concentrations in nasal secretion remained low, whereas interleukin 8 concentrations in nasal secretion were high. Human metapneumovirus is a clinically important causative agent of acute wheezing in young children.",

Identification of this virus was based on virological data, sequence homology, and gene constellation. Clinically and cytopathologically, infection with human metapneumovirus resembles that of respiratory syncytial virus, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children. Results of a serological survey 1 showed that human metapneumovirus usually infects young children; all 80 children in the survey in the Netherlands at the age of 5 years were seropositive for the virus. We investigated the frequency of human metapneumovirus in children admitted to the paediatric department of Turku University Hospital, Finland for acute expiratory airway obstruction.",

Paramedics did cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and endotracheal intubation, and administered intraosseous epinephrine. On arrival at the emergency department, the patient was in ventricular fibrillation, and had a temperature of 16\u00b72\u00b0C (taken with a rectal thermometer). Although CPR was ongoing, the patient was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit for rewarming by ECLS. Active external rewarming (Bair-Hugger device, Augustine Medical, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) was begun, and warmed endotracheal gas delivered during preparation for cannulation. The Bair-Hugger surface rewarms by blowing air of up to 43\u00baC into a blanket that lies on or surrounds the patient. After 90 min of CPR, the patient spontaneously converted to a sinus rhythm (heart rate 25 beats per min) at a core temperature of 17\u00b75\u00b0C, as the surgeon prepared to insert the ECLS cannulae. Since the patient's pulse was palpable, treatment with ECLS was postponed. Delivery of warmed endotracheal gas and active external rewarming was maintained. The patient required no further fluid boluses or inotropic support. Systolic blood pressure via the femoral line was greater than 70 mm Hg. Lactate concentration peaked at 7\u00b73 mmol/L. Intravenous fluids were given at 100% of calculated maintenance dose. Her core temperature rose to 35\u00b76\u00b0C over the next 3 h. She was discharged with severe frostbite, but no neurological sequelae, according to CT scan and neurological examination by a paediatrician, after 35 days in hospital.",

On arrival at the hospital, however, his pulse had stopped and his heart rate was still only 20-30 beats per min. The boy's temperature was 17\u00b79\u00b0C (taken with a rectal thermometer). His pulse returned after administration of single boluses of epinephrine and atropine. He was taken to the operating room for ECLS rewarming. A sternotomy was done in preparation for cannulation. Direct observation of myocardial contractility and invasively assessed blood pressure by arterial line measurement, showing systolic pressure greater than 70 mm Hg, prompted continued rewarming via administration of endotracheal gas, active external rewarming (Bair-Hugger device), and use of heating lamps over the surgical field. Mediastinal irrigation was not done. Rewarming, from 18\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C, took 3\u00b75 h. No further inotropic therapy was required.

Bystanders at the lakeside started CPR when they noticed the child had no pulse and was apnoeic. On arrival, paramedics ventilated the child with a bag-valve mask, using 100% oxygen. After a short time, the girl's pulse returned and she began to breath unaided. On arrival in the emergency room, her heart rate was 44 beats per min with irregular respiratory effort. Her temperature was 19\u00b73\u00b0C (taken with a rectal thermometer). She was intubated, and low-dose dopamine was administered.

Many centres do not have rapid access to this service, however, and are still dependent on active internal rewarming techniques-eg, peritoneal and pleural lavage. Such interventions are invasive, and associated with inherent risk. Here, we report our successful experience with an active external rewarming technique in children with profound hypothermia (core temperature <20\u00b0C). Case series of severe hypothermia are infrequently reported, and those that are generally involve use of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) therapy for resuscitation.
