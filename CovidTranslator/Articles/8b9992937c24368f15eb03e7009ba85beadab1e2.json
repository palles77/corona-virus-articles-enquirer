Eighty-eight ILI episodes resulted in hospitalization, of which 8 were associated with RSV ( prevalence 9.1% [4.0-17.1]; incidence 0.2 [0.1-0.3] per 100 PY). The incidence of RSV-associated ILI resulting in medical attendance was 6.0 (5.4-6.7) per 100 PY. RSV B subtypes were observed more frequently than A subtypes.",

We therefore conducted 1 year of prospective active and passive community-based surveillance of healthy children in multiple tropical and southern hemisphere countries where prospective data are lacking. Because community-based surveillance is difficult and costly to carry out, most studies have been based on hospital-based surveillance. This captures only severe RSV infection that has resulted in hospitalization [3] and is limited in developing countries by its dependence on access to hospitals. Because our study was conducted as part of a clinical trial, it benefitted from active follow-up, a well-characterized population, consistent methodology between countries, samples taken from a high proportion of children, and use of a sensitive and specific PCR assay for RSV detection. In addition, we studied a wide age range up to 10 years, unlike most other studies that typically focused on children aged \u22645 years. By stratifying the age groups, we could detect differences in incidence and prevalence across ages.",

The observed overall prevalence of RSV subtype B in ILI was higher than subtype A (6.5% vs 3.0%), although this was not consistent across countries. Overall, prevalence declined with age, ranging from 18.2% in the 6-through 11-month age group to 3.7% in the >60-month age group. The Philippines was the only country with the highest RSV prevalence in the youngest age group (37.1%); in other countries, the highest prevalence was in the 12-through 23-or the 24through 35-month age groups. The incidence of RSV in ILI across countries ranged from 0 to 81.1 per 100 PY (6-11 months), 0 to 31.1 per 100 PY (12-23 months), 10.8 to 24.7 Figure 2 . Prevalence of influenza-like illness (ILI) episodes in which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected, by country and age (total cohort with ILI episodes tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction). Abbreviations: AU, Australia; BR, Brazil; CO, Colombia; CR, Costa Rica; MX, Mexico; PH, Philippines; SG, Singapore; TH, Thailand. were the only countries with the highest incidence in infants aged 6-11 months; in other countries, the highest incidence was in the 12-through 23-or the 24-through 35-month age groups. However, interpretation of the 6-11 month estimates was limited, as data were sparse in this age group, with only 3.8% (143/3717) of ILI episodes occurring among children aged 6-11 months at the time of the episode, resulting in wide CIs. A cohort effect was also probable, since children left the age group when they reached age 12 months, but no other children entered it. Thus, unlike the other groups, no children remained in the 6-through 11-month age group approximately 6 months post-enrollment, with the result that the observation period for this group was shortened and estimates captured only a portion of the total RSV season. Active surveillance studies tend to report higher prevalence and incidence of RSV than passive surveillance but are much less common [3] . A few active surveillance studies reporting the prevalence or incidence per person-years of RSV in respiratory disease are available; however, differences in case definitions, location, age, and method of viral detection limit comparison with our study. In Australia, active surveillance detected RSV in 7% of samples from preschool children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) [13] . A global systematic review of RSV-associated ALRI in children aged <5 years identified 36 studies, of which 6 used active surveillance [3] . The estimated incidence per 100 PY in these studies was 2.2 in Bangladesh, 2.7 in India, 4.8 in Indonesia, 8.4 in Kenya, 9.4 in Nigeria, and 12.8 in Guatemala.",

A much lower incidence of RSV-associated LRTI in Indonesia was seen in another study, although the highest incidence was again in the 6through 8-month age group [15] . In Indonesia, the relatively low incidence in 0-to 5-month-olds is hypothesized to be linked to a cultural practice where newborns are kept as isolated as possible during the first months of life. Use of the same protocol in Nigeria yielded incidence rates up to approximately 20 per 100 PY, with the highest rates in the 3-through 5-and 9through 11-month age groups [15] . In Kenya, the incidence of RSV-associated LRTI was highest in infants aged 0-5 months (14.7 per 100 PY), with incidences of 5.9 to 8.8 per 100 PY in children aged 6-30 months [7] .

Most ILI episodes were medically attended, with an overall incidence of RSV-associated ILI requiring medical attendance of 6.0 per 100 PY. One third of ILI episodes associated with RSV resulted in absence from school or day care; however, not all children attended school or day care. Eight of 88 ILI episodes that required hospitalization were associated with RSV, an overall incidence of 0.2 per 100 PY. This compares with RSV-associated LRTI hospitalization of 1 per 100 PY in Kenya [7] . However, surprisingly few pneumonia cases were observed in our study. A recent review of pneumonia worldwide estimated the number of new episodes of RSV-associated pneumonia in children aged 0-4 years to be 17 778 in Australia, 431 938 in Brazil, 140 879 in Colombia, 10 724 in Costa Rica, 320 132 in Mexico, 700 364 in the Philippines, 3126 in Singapore, and 186 889 in Thailand, although the incidence rate was not calculated [17] .",

Despite this limitation, we demonstrated a high RSV burden, highlighting that it is not confined to children at high risk. Because fever was part of the ILI definition, we did not capture all ARI and are likely to have missed some cases associated with RSV in children with no fever. To put this into context, fever was recorded in approximately 70% of RSV-positive respiratory tract infections primarily in children aged <2 years 6 months [18, 19] . In addition, we were unable to calculate absolute population denominator rates for RSV incidence or hospitalization, and we had relatively small numbers of RSV-associated illness for subanalyses. Finally, we recruited no children aged <6 months and a limited number of children aged 6-11 months, so our findings are relevant only to older children. Our use of active surveillance of healthy children provided evidence of the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness that would not be identified through the more usual hospitalbased surveillance methods. A substantial part of the RSV burden occurs in older infants and children. This has implications for future vaccination strategies, including the possibility of broadening the target age range.",
