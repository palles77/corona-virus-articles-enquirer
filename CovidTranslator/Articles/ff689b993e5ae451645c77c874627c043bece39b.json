Foal heat diarrhea, as the term implies, occurs in foals from 6-14 days of age and coincides with the first estrus cycle in the post-partum mare. This appears to be coincidental as foals separated from their dams and fed a controlled diet will still develop diarrhea at the same age. The cause of foal heat diarrhea has been widely debated with strongyloidosis and changes in milk composition largely eliminated as possible causes. From the work of Masri et at. (1986) it appears that the diarrhea results from a physiological change within the gastrointestinal tract as the foal develops a normal bacterial flora.",

Clinical signs can vary from slight -a febrile foal that is not nursing, to profoundprofuse watery to lightly hemorrhagic diarrhea accompanied by colic. The diarrhea can be fetid, and vary in color and consistency. In some cases atypical enteritis may be present in that the clinical assessment and blood values are consistent with enteritis but diarrhea is not present at the time of examination. Colic caused by enteritis may be difficult to differentiate from a surgical colic if blood values are reasonably normal and fever is not present (see Chapter 22). Abdominal pain associated with the early stages of viral enteritis can be severe, 494 with tympany and occasionally gastric reflux. Further clinical diagnostic procedures are indicated in these cases with ultrasound examination being the diagnostic method most useful to rule out intussusception, volvulus, torsion, or peritonitis. A percentage of enteritic foals are unresponsive to analgesics and cannot be differentiated from surgical cases until tympany has been relieved by the use of prokinetics or, more rarely, percutaneous trocarization. Trocarization is usually contraindicated wherever surgical options are available since foals should be considered more susceptible to secondary peritonitis than adults.",

Fluid therapy, oral or parenteral, for maintenance of normal hydration is the main objective of treatment. Fluid therapy is necessary to correct dehydration, shock, and electrolyte imbalances. In some cases colloids (plasma, albumin, or hetastarch) may assist in the intravascular retention of crystalloid (fluid) therapy. Other treatments include the use of antidiarrheal medications, analgesics, and antipyretics. The fluids and colloids selected are based on laboratory findings, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, and clinical signs. Oral supplementation should include access to fresh and electrolyte water, and a salt block. Potassium deficits can be corrected in intravenous fluids at a rate of 0.5 mEq kg-1 h' or orally as potassium chloride in the form of 'lite' salt mixed with yogurt. Patients with reflux, ileus, or extreme cachexia may benefit from the initiation of total parenteral nutrition (with or without lipids). Antidiarrheal medications are rarely effective in altering the course of the diarrhea but medications such as bismuth subsalicylate and kaolin may help reduce bowel inflammation and provide for secondary toxin absorption and resorption when combined with activated charcoal. Oral plasma from adult donors has been used in cases of viral diarrhea in foals with questionable efficacy. Analgesic use in viral diarrheas should emphasize the discriminating use of ulcerogenic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAlDs). Dipyrone is not currently available commercially but has provided excellent analgesia in mild colic, along with its anti-pyretic activity, in foals with diarrhea of various causes. Intravenous and intramuscular butorphanol (in small animal dilutions) is useful in the control of colic without cardiovascular or ulcerogenic side effects. Xylazine may also be used to control colic but temporarily affects cardiovascular function and potentiates ileus.",

Exposure is from carrier adults, infected foals, and mechanical transmission by humans and fomites. The incubation period is 1-2 days and it is highly infectious to suckling foals of any age. The pathogenesis of infection primarily involves the intestinal epithelial cells. Villi become shortened or denuded, crypts become hyperplastic, and the ensuing diarrhea is combined secretory and malabsorptive enteritis. Additionally carbohydrate enzymes and lactose become deficient. The diarrhea, if present, is usually watery and distinctly fetid. Diagnosis is by ELISA testing or electron microscopy of feces for viral particle identification. Treatment is non-specific and the virus can be shed for approximately 5-7 days after the diarrhea has resolved. Medications containing lactase have been used to improve digestion of milk lactose, but the efficacy of this treatment remains unproven. A commercial modified live virus vaccine is currently available for use in mares prior to foaling to accentuate colostral antibodies.

The disease was highly infectious with virtually every foal at respective farms being clinically affected within 36 hours of birth. The clinical signs include a pinkish watery diarrhea, relatively non-fetid, usually complicated by dehydration and colic associated with abdominal tympany. Colics were often severe and unresponsive to analgesics. Neostigmine used to relieve tympany was most effective in the resolution of colic. Often treatments were empirical or symptomatic. Routine sanitation procedures, including pressure washings and disinfection, were ineffective. Washings and disinfection of the mares' udders were also ineffective. Foaling in paddocks or pens outside the barn environment resulted in a dramatic cessa-tion of new clinical cases.

Among these are flagellar and chemotactically directed motility, capsular and surface antigens, macrophage-induced proteins, endotoxin, enterotoxin, cytotoxin, plasmids, and iron-chelating enzymes.

Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be established based on sensitivity results of fecal or blood cultures. Ideally lipid-soluble antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfonamides and chloramphenicol, should be used as the Salmonella organism survives intracellularly. Often the Salmonella spp. isolated, especially in nosocomial infections, will be resistant to the aforementioned antibiotics, and other broad-spectrum choices such as third generation cephalosporins or penicillin and aminoglycoside combinations are found to be more effective. Antibiotics may contribute to the release of endotoxins in cases of rapid bacterial death. For this reason patients can be treated with medications that decrease the effects of circulating endotoxin prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy. Polymyxin B, at a low dose of 6000 IU /kg, binds and removes endotoxin from circulation. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as flunixin meglumine (0.25 mg/kg i.v, t.i.d.) will both ameliorate the effects of endotoxemia by decreasing synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and decrease the secretory component of diarrhea by blocking prostaglandin-mediated hypersecretion of enterocytes. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used cautiously in foals because of the greater risk of gastroduodenal ulcers. Pentoxifylline (7.5 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d.) has been shown to reduce endotoxin-induced synthesis of tumor necrosis factor, a contributor to endotoxemia associated with sepsis. In addition, pentoxifylline increases red blood cell deformability, decreases blood viscosity, decreases platelet aggregation, and decreases thrombus formation, thereby combating conditions contributing to impairment of regional blood flow.",

The incidence of disease associated with Rhodococcus equi, however, varies. On some farms R. equi pneumonia is rare, while on others clinical disease occurs enzootically, even though the organism can be cultured from the soil of both. This incongruity is likely to be a result of differences in the type of soil, climate, prevalence of dusty conditions, stocking rate, and intensity of management that exist between farms, as well as differences in virulence among resident strains of the organism. Virulent strains of R. equi are characterized by the presence of a 15 or 17.5 kDa virulence-associated protein (VapA) on the cell membrane. Farms which have clinical disease due to R. equi are usually endemic premises for VapA strains of the organism, while farms having little incidence of disease are infected less heavily with the virulent organism. This protein is encoded for by an 85 or 90-kilobase plasmid. Though long recognized as an identifying marker for virulent strains, it has recently been shown conclusively that this plasmid is in fact a virulence factor for the organism. The presence of the plasmid is essential for intracellular replication within macrophages and subsequent development of disease. The organism dwells and replicates within phagosomes after being phagocytized by macrophages, preventing (by an unknown mechanism) the usual fusion of the phagosome with a lysosome. Macrophages thus infected do not undergo the respiratory burst associated with the lysosomal enzymatic activation which mediates intracellular killing. Infection of macrophage cells by R. equi eventually causes the degeneration and death of the immune cell, possibly by inappropriate lysosomal rupture and degranulation into the cytoplasm. Neutrophil cells of both foals and adult horses function as effective phagocytes, and can effectively process and destroy R. equi.",

R. equi pneumonia is also prevalent in areas with grass pasture and little or no dust or exposed soil. In these circumstances, feces from adult horses serving as passive carriers may be an important source of exposure for foals. In adult horses, ingestion results in passive passage of the organism through the intestinal tract, with resultant deposition of the bacterium back into the environment. In immunologically naive foals, however, the organism thrives and replicates, resulting in significant amplification of bacterial numbers in the environment and enhanced risk to other young stock if manure produced by infected foals is not promptly removed. During the optimal environmental conditions that prevail during summer months, R. equi numbers in contaminated soil can multiply by ten-thousand-fold in 2 weeks, such that 1 gram of soil could theoretically contain millions of virulent organisms.",
