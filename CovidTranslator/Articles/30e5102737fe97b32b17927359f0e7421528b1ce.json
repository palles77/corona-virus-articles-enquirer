Microbiologists are increasingly being asked to apply their scientific knowledge to respond to these threats. The recent pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus illustrated not only how a newly evolved pathogen can rapidly spread throughout the world but also how the global community can unite to identify the causative agent and control its spread. Rapid response research mechanisms, such as those used by the SARS Accelerated Vaccine Initiative (SAVI), have shown that the application of emergency management techniques, together with rapid response research, can be highly effective when applied appropriately to new infectious diseases.",

Pandemics and epidemics have been commonplace as the density of the world's population and international travel and trade have increased to support the global spread of pathogens. Microbial pathogens are constantly evolving, and new pathogens are continually emerging from nature. The recent emergence of many new pathogens, including HIV, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, West Nile virus, Legionella pneumophila, Cryptococcus neoformans subspecies gattii and various influenza A strains, is actually biology taking its normal course, as microorganisms evolve to exploit new or altered ecological niches 1, 2 . Therefore, it is no surprise that the first pandemic of the twenty-first century appeared quickly, late in 2002, with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causing significant morbidity (approximately 8,500 cases) and mortality (774 deaths), and had an estimated economic impact of US $90 billion worldwide 3 .",

Worldwide, scientists responded to these challenges with extreme vigour, and many achievements were made (FIG. 1) , including identifying the causative agent, sequencing its genome, developing animal models of infection and determining where the pathogen originated in nature and how it was globally spread in human communities. However, despite the acquisition of this large body of scientific information, as SARS was spreading around the world a method of controlling the virus was required in case it escaped containment measures. This meant that alternative therapeutic and preventative methods were urgently needed.",

Grant applications, peer review and funding mechanisms are traditionally not rapid processes. Responding to emerging infectious diseases of pressing public health importance requires a scientific process that is significantly different from traditional procedures. Such a response must focus the science directly on a practical solution to the problem, and solve several scientific problems in parallel instead of in sequence. The SARS pandemic provided the perfect opportunity to attempt to develop such a system. clinical trials, regulatory affairs and international collaborations were all developed in parallel instead of sequentially. As soon as the genome became available, a bioinformatics web site was created, which was used by SAVI scientists as well as many other SARS researchers around the world (see SARS Bioinformatics Suite in the online links box). In addition, there was a large demand worldwide for full-length sequenced clones of the various SARS coronavirus genes. Several programmes were put in place to clone and express viral proteins that could be used both as reagents and in vaccine studies. Methods were developed for growing the virus in tissue culture (using Vero cells), and a neutralization assay was developed, both of which were necessary for vaccine development.",

Although the immune correlates for protection against SARS-CoV are not yet completely defined, individuals convalescing from SARS are known to develop high titres of neutralizing antibodies 8 . The appearance of these neutralizing antibodies coincided with the onset of resolution of SARS pneumonia 9,10 and, as with other coronaviruses 11 , there is an inverse relationship between disease severity and the levels of pre-existing serum antibodies. So, neutralizing antibodies are likely to be important in protection against SARS. T-cell immunity is also likely to be necessary for protection from SARS, as it is for many other viruses. For instance, low concentrations of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells during a SARS infection are correlated with increased disease severity and mortality 12 , and specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles have been correlated with SARS susceptibility 13 . Taken together, the data indicated that a vaccine for SARS would need to induce neutralizing antibodies and, possibly, CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses. This knowledge proved helpful in selecting vaccine candidates and immunization approaches.",

To successfully commercialize a vaccine, a strong intellectual property position is needed 25 . SAVI was fortunate in that it is partnered with the group that sequenced the SARS-CoV, and they protected the genome sequence 5 . However, additional intellectual property issues will arise as the project progresses, and there will also be preexisting intellectual property in place that must be incorporated, such as the use of live attenuated vectors or protein expression systems. SAVI decided to not make itself a legal entity, but to leave the ownership of intellectual property with the inventors and their home universities. This saved significant time, as intellectual property mechanisms are already established at the various partner universities, and issues such as royalty rates are already settled. An appropriate way to deal with intellectual property remains a significant challenge worldwide for the development and commercialization of SARS vaccines.",

Vaccines often take many years to develop, yet the need for a SARS vaccine was urgent. So, at the beginning of the initiative, discussions were held with the appropriate regulatory bodies (Health Canada and the US FDA) to gain their support and obtain documents describing regulatory guidelines for biological agents. In addition, SAVI worked with regulatory authorities and consultants to define the steps that were needed for vaccine development, including the use of clinically approved cell lines for vaccine generation, avoidance of animal products for vaccine production, identification of plasmids Another important consideration in vaccine testing is the availability of a relevant animal infection and challenge model. When the vaccine studies were initiated, there were no animal models available, but it was assumed that they would be developed quickly. As rapid vaccine development was the ultimate goal, it was decided, assuming they became available, to initially test the vaccine candidates in the most relevant animal infection model possible -non-human primates. Small-animal vaccine models can be misleading and time consuming. Soon after, a macaque infection model was published 17, 18 , and significant efforts were made to secure primates for these studies. However, recently there have been significant concerns that primate models are not the best infection models, and tests in many laboratories indicate that they only exhibit mild respiratory infections 19 .At present, ferrets seem to be the most relevant disease model 20 , and relevant murine models have been developed that allow viral replication 21 . Owing to the high costs of doing primate experiments in biosafety level III containment facilities and the concerns about the relevance of a primate challenge model, at present SAVI vaccines are first tested in ferrets and mice, and then in non-human primates or other small animals for safety and immunogenicity. Similarly, other groups are testing adenoviruses 22 , modified vaccinia viruses 23 and a DNA vaccine 24 in both murine and macaque models. Although this additional step adds time to the project, it is necessary and imperative to show protection in an animal infection model that closely mimics human disease. It was anticipated that testing in multiple animal models would also help eliminate concerns regarding vaccine-induced immune enhancement or immunopathology 14 .",

Several additional collaborations were formed at this meeting, as well as a better understanding of where the world stood with regard to vaccines.

The timeframe from starting to write a peerreviewed grant application to when funds are received in the laboratory is usually more than one year, which is unsuitable for rapid response research. So rapid funding mechanisms must be established to ensure that appropriate research is carried out in a timely manner. When SAVI was established, the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research, the provincial health research funding agency in British Columbia, was used to control and dispense the research funds. Using a five-member senior management committee consisting of senior scientists, a rapid review mechanism was established. Short (2-page), focused research proposals, together with a proposed research budget, which dealt directly with aspects of vaccine development, were solicited and accepted from the research community. The committee reviewed and evaluated the projects on the basis of scientific merit and the direct need for the project, and funds were dispersed to successful applicants immediately -usually 24 hours after the application was submitted. While ensuring that applications were peer-reviewed, this rapid review process significantly enhanced the speed of the project, NATURE REVIEWS | MICROBIOLOGY VOLUME 2 | JULY 2004 | 6 0 5 infectious diseases that was exemplified by SARS is patient consent. When clinical samples are taken, especially early during the outbreak, the potential research uses of such samples are not known, and it is difficult to specify exactly what they will be used for.

Ideally, all rapid response research would be done under such conditions from the start, but this is nearly impossible, especially with infectious agents. Instead, once a candidate vaccine or therapeutic is identified, the work has to be reproduced under such conditions, which significantly lengthens the production time. At the outset, if standardized cell lines (such as Vero cells), attenuated viral vectors (such as adenovirus) and adjuvant (alum) are chosen that are already approved for human use, significant time can be saved in product development 15, 26 . SARS is particularly challenging as it requires biosafety level III containment. All animal studies must be done in stringent containment facilities, of which there are only a few in the world. Similarly, if a whole killed viral vaccine is to be manufactured, highly specialized biosafety level III GMP facilities are needed, again few of which exist worldwide 27 . Owing to the perceived threat of biological agents, several Biosafety level III containment facilities have recently been approved for construction. However, performing rapid response research on highly infectious agents that are new to the world places a major burden on such specialized facilities, especially biosafety level III large animal (primate) and GMP facilities. Efficient use of such space requires global cooperation and judicial prioritization.",

In fact, other scholars from the non-life-science areas of academia also freely offered their time and skills to deal with related problems. All scientists were willing to contribute their relevant expertise and a portion of their laboratory's resources to work towards a common goal, with no particular individual gain immediately obvious. Although this willingness is probably accentuated when one perceives a significant threat to one's country, it is also a powerful motivating factor when seeking to obtain particular expertise during rapid response research. Similarly, international cooperation and coordination are needed to avoid significant duplication and redundancy of efforts, as well as to share progress. In an ideal situation, expertise around the world would be coordinated, but this poses major logistical and political challenges. The WHO had a pivotal role throughout the SARS pandemic, not only in tracking the disease, but also by convening meetings of researchers working on potential vaccine therapeutics and diagnostics. In the face of future pandemics, a coordinated international rapid response research approach will be essential to develop new ways of controlling these scourges. A main difficulty with SARS research was the limited availability of clinical samples to researchers and the standardization of such samples. Some countries had national Centres for Disease Control that collected and coordinated clinical samples, whereas in others it was left to the individual hospitals. An important problem with studying emerging an alternative inexpensive disease model compared with non-human primates, although reports on the use of these small animals for SARS-CoV vaccine testing is scarce. However, despite these different animal models, no single animal species has been shown to reproduce all of the clinical signs and lethality that is observed in humans that are infected with SARS-CoV.",

This resulted in a bilateral agreement to work together on SARS vaccine trials. This collaboration was greatly facilitated by strong political support from both China and Canada, two countries that were significantly affected by SARS. The most obvious question is how SARS vaccines will be evaluated for human efficacy given the lack of human SARS cases globally this year. Ordinarily, Phase I to Phase III human clinical trials are designed to provide an understanding of the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in humans as well as identification of correlates of immunity. Without an outbreak of SARS that could be used to test the efficacy of the vaccines in humans, licensure of the vaccine under emergency conditions might have to take place under the FDA's 'animal efficacy rule' , which states that vaccines or other biological agents can be licensed if they meet two criteria: human safety and the demonstration of adequate protection against a deliberate infection challenge in two species of animals (see vaccine policy in the online links). For the SARS vaccines to go directly from animals to humans under these conditions, vaccine efficacy and safety must be evaluated in animals followed by Phase I safety evaluation and immunogenicity testing in healthy human volunteers. Such a Phase I study is currently ongoing in China with an inactivated SARS virus 19 . At present, there are not enough SARS cases to test the vaccine further in Phase II and III trials. Despite the lack of an ongoing SARS threat, rapid response initiatives such as SAVI will continue to be necessary as it is important to have a vaccine available should SARS return. Furthermore, such initiatives are strongly supported by internationally recognized scientists, each with a strong expertise in a particular area of research and development. This is in contrast to pharmaceutical companies where product focus is more diffuse and the expertise is suitable for GMP vaccine manufacturing and organizing clinical trials in humans.",

Second, the lack of understanding of some diseases and the complexity of the science involved in producing the appropriate immune response for vaccines are also a deterrent. Finally, consumers are more willing to pay for treatment than prevention; this is one reason why vaccines represent less than 2% of the world pharmaceutical market 28, 29 . The solution to this problem is the establishment of public health-biotechnology industry partnerships. Public and private sectors need to work together to ensure a 'win-win' system for vaccine development. Governments can help support vaccine development in several ways: set up public-sector laboratories and research facilities to help reduce research and development costs; sponsor human clinical trials to reduce costs and help acceleration of the product to market; set up tax credits to stimulate research and development in selected areas; set up public sector advocacy to stimulate demand; and purchase large volumes or stockpiles of vaccines, which would help reduce market uncertainty 28, 29 . Companies provide valuable expertise in areas such as GMP production facilities and clinical trials and are therefore poised to take products further down the commercialization route. Successful contracts have been established between the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and two vaccine companies to produce GMP-grade whole-killed vaccine that the NIH can test in Phase I human clinical trials. This should be ready for use in about one year. Although often difficult to structure, partnerships between corporate entities and research agencies are crucial to move findings from rapid response research forward into clinical practice.",

Research methodologies are significantly improved, and the application of rapid response research to SARS demonstrated that it is possible to rapidly identify a new pathogen, sequence its genome and develop preventative, therapeutic and diagnostic approaches within a very short time frame (FIG. 1) . Although it required a slight redirection of researchers and resources, the response to SARS has shown that there are ample mechanisms available to use emergency management procedures and apply them to rapid response research with a direct goal in mind 27, 30 . Although one cannot predict where or what the next pandemic will be, we know with certainty that there will be more. We need to learn from our research experiences with SARS and put the mechanisms and models in place to allow us to effectively respond rapidly to such threats. By so doing, we will be in a much better position than just relying on quarantine, isolation and infection-control precautions, which may or may not contain the outbreak. These approaches will provide the world with new and better ways to control emerging infectious diseases in a 'just-in-time' fashion. ",
