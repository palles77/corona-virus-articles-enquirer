NGS was performed on the respiratory 30 samples from patient 1 and on the primary isolate, prior to any further passage, by using Ion Torrent 31 S5 platform (Thermofisher).

All variants were 46 confirmed by Sanger Sequencing.47    Considering the analysis of genomic variability, several intra-sample variants were observed in both 48 the isolate and the clinical sample, but only the positions with a minimum coverage of 20 reads 49 were considered. Intra-sample assessment of overall virus genome variability resulted 1.27 x10 -4 50 and 1.02x10 -4 nucleotide substitutions per site for the isolate and the clinical sample, respectively.51Only two variable positions were observed with a frequency >10% in the clinical sample, both in 52 Orf1a: A2269T (13.73%, coverage: 51x), synonymous for amino acid A668, and G7388A (13.21%, 53 coverage: 53x), leading to amino acid change (A2375T). Interestingly, the frequency of variants at 54 position 2269 was different in the isolate, being T dominant over A in 72% of reads (coverage: 55 119582x), accounting for the difference resulting in the consensus sequences.56For the phylogenetic analysis, 87 full genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences were retrieved from 57 GISAID, along with WH-01_MN908947.3 from Gen Bank. The G26145T substitution observed in 58 the isolate from Italy was also present in 5 sequences from cases occurring out of China: 59 EPI_ISL_406596 and EPI_ISL_406597 from France, EPI_ISL_406031 from Taiwan, 60 EPI_ISL_406036 from USA, EPI_ISL_406844 and EPI_ISL_408977 from Australia. All the 61 genomes carrying this mutation are included in a significant phylogenetic cluster (bootstrap 87%),62 suggesting common origin (Figure 1a/b); in fact, the G251V substitution in Orf3a has been recently 63 defined as the marker variant of the \"V\" clade (GISAID). 64 The presence of quasispecies has previously been reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [3,4], 65 suggesting that these beta coronaviruses may consist of complex and dynamic distributions of 66 closely related variants in vivo, similar to other RNA viruses. When applied to SARS-CoV-2 in this 67 study, the analysis of sequence variability supported the presence of viral quasispecies in the clinical sample as well as in the primary isolate. Namely, two positions with variant frequency 69 >10% were observed in the biological sample, both in Orf1a: A2269T, synonymous, and G7388A, 70 corresponding to aminoacid change A2375T. The synonymous variant A2269T, representing a 71 minority variant in the clinical sample, was the dominant one in the isolate. Although low coverage 72 may have affected the precise calculation of minority variant frequency in the clinical sample, the 73 data are consistent with variant selection occurred during the isolation procedure, as previously 74 shown for other respiratory viruses. In the respiratory sample neither mutations nor intra-sample 75 variants were found at positions 8,782 and 28,144, recently identified as hotspots of hypervariability 76 (coverage: 61x and 76x respectively) [5]. 77 Full genome characterization of new viruses is instrumental for updating diagnostics and assessing 78 viral evolution. On the other hand, virus variability, leading to the development of quasispecies 79 within infected patients, may provide the background for virus evolution and adaptation to new 80 hosts; more studies are necessary to unravel the importance of intra-patient variability in the SARSstate that there are no relevant conflicts of interest to declare. 85 This research was supported by funds to National Institute for Infectious Diseases 'Lazzaro 86 Spallanzani' IRCCS from: Ministero della Salute, Ricerca Corrente. 87 We gratefully acknowledge the contributors of genome sequences of the newly emerging 88 coronavirus, i.e. the Originating and Submitting Laboratories, for sharing their sequences and other 89 metadata through the GISAID Initiative, on which this research is based.",
