To reduce the possibilities of spread, this research creates an infection probability model based on the settling velocity and concentration distribution of infectious droplets. Then, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is employed to track the travel history (time, date and place) of the infected patients. A tree structure algorithm and an infection probability model are applied to trace the transmission routes, discover the correlations between carriers and suspected cases, and finally calculate the infection probability on the basis of time interval. In case of an epidemic outbreak or once an infected case is confirmed, the disease tracking and control system could be initiated by accessing RFID logs to plot the carriers' time of onset and to trace possible routes of transmission via tree diagrams. The disease tracking and control system developed in this research can assist hospitals in assessing the risk of infection among medical personnel, as well as in prompt implementation of infection prevention and control measures, in order to reduce hospital acquired infections and provide a safe health care setting.",

            "text": "Due to a massive outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced in April 2003 that SARS was caused by a new variant of coronavirus, officially named the \"SARS-Cov\" (Peris-Lopez et al. 2011) . After the SARS epidemic, human cases of a new influenza A (H1N1) were initially reported in Mexico in 2009. Infection with influenza A (H1N1) virus is defined as acute febrile respiratory illness with laboratory-confirmed positive results (Viviani et al. 2011) . Since the 2009 outbreak of the flu influenza in North America, suspected H1N1 cases have continually been reported in other continents. Though the H1N1 epidemic may not lead to worse consequences than SARS (Lau et al. 2009 ), in view of the fact that infectious diseases spread rapidly in densely polluted areas, proper quarantine and other preventive measures should be taken immediately to curb the spread of the influenza virus. To detect potential routes of disease transmission, the hospital can use radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to develop a tracking and control system that monitors the infected patients. Based on the dynamic records of patients and medical personnel inside the hospital, data analysis Hsu and Chien 2007 ) and a tree structure algorithm can be applied to reconstruct the transmission routes, and then calculate the infection probability by modes of transmission. The disease control personnel can notify the hospital's disease reporting system to have the identification data of the suspected case entered into the tracking and control system. Then the control personnel can determine probability variables based on the spread of infection, while accessing the RFID data stored in the tracking and control system to know people's whereabouts and movements. The infection probability of all people going in and out the hospital could thus be calculated in no time to find out who might have been infected and proceed with proper treatment. After identifying exposure sources and suspected cases, infection control personnel will be able to enforce isolation or quarantine and sanitize all affected areas in hope to stop the virus infection from spreading.",

            "text": "Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms, widely applied in complex network design, have also been adopted to minimize risk in solving NP-hard problems (Chen et al. 2009 ). Integrating tree diagrams with network nodes, a composite neighborhood structure was proposed, using a dynamic programming algorithm for fast and efficient proximity search on large graphs (Ahuja et al. 2003) . Besides, spanning tree and genetic algorithms were combined to optimize the system and tackle regional network problems (Gen et al. 2005) . Capacitated Minimum Spanning Tree and fuzzy logic rules were also applied to develop a rapid approximate inference algorithm that, with uncertain cost and demand parameters, keeps each node from exceeding gross demand restrictions in order to achieve cost minimization (\u00d6ncan 2007) . Decision tree algorithms likewise search in the format of a branching diagram that supports classification, linear regression and association analysis. An optimal decision tree represents an effective search strategy that performs only a minimum number of node queries and thus involves the least search time. Dynamic programming is often adopted to help reduce the time complexity of the algorithm (Cicalese et al. 2011) . In supervised classification training, for instance, decision graphs have been found to significantly enhance the efficiency of classification models constructed for wireless network planning (Nielsen et al. 2009 ). In clinical and epidemiological analysis, tree diagrams have also been used to formulate classification rules that help clinical practitioners to distinguish between clusters of signs and symptoms and quickly reach a diagnosis (Marshall 2001) . The literature review above shows that tree diagrams have been widely applied in research on search path optimization and data classification, and can clearly demonstrate association rules and hierarchical structures of data. Therefore, this research adopted a tree diagram algorithm to find connections between virus carriers and the infected patients inside the hospital.",

Most of these RFID applications are used for tracking and identity recognition to ensure that patients receive needed medical care and to support disease control (Kumar et al. 2009 ). Meanwhile, through visual images and RFID tags attached to predefined objects, healthcare personnel could also deliver home care services to dementia patients and have a better understanding of the patients' behavior (Wherton and Monk 2008) . Besides, RFID could help to deal with events involving great complexity, such as monitoring and tracking patients' body temperatures, so much so that, in case of emergency, medical personnel could make professional judgement decisions immediately based on collected data (Yao et al. 2011) . RFID can also be applied to medical inventory management. Without incurring any extra costs, RFID technology is capable of providing continuous review of inventory, which has been proven superior to the periodic review of barcode technology (\u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 et al. 2011) . In medication management, RFID has been used to enhance inpatient medication safety through a wireless network system for automated tracking of prescription drugs (Ohashi et al. 2010) . With continuous, real-time information regarding the clinical situations and patients' location, hospital pharmacy personnel could differentiate batch number, dosage, and usage of drugs to reduce dispensing errors, while nurses could correctly identify patients, administer medication on time, and keep track of drug delivery routes (Peris-Lopez et al. 2011 ).",

Direct transmission results from having physical contact with an infected individual, such as that person's mouth, nose, and skin, or infectious droplets of saliva and mucus from coughs and sneezes. Coughing and sneezing are symptoms of respiratory infection, such as the SARS and influenza A (H1N1). Both SARS and influenza A (H1N1) are caused by newly discovered respiratory tract viruses. The SARS virus, according to WHO's announcement in April 2003, is a novel coronavirus SARS-Cov, which is a single-stranded RNA virus (Lau and Peiris 2005; Feng and Gao 2007) . The pathogen of influenza A (H1N1) is swine influenza virus (SIV). SIV, classified into the Orthomyxoviridae family, is a negative strand RNA virus (Leahy et al. 1997 ). These pandemic-prone diseases, mainly spread by infectious droplets or droplet nuclei, can be contracted by inhaling small-particle aerosols (Tang et al. 2006; Buchbinder et al. 2011) .",

These airborne droplets come in different sizes. Whereas small droplets evaporate and disperse in the air quickly, large droplets are subject to influences of such external factors as the size of a space, wind speed, airflow, temperature and humidity change. As large droplets evaporate and gravitationally settle, they would attach to different surfaces and materials (Redrow et al. 2011) . Aerosols refer to small solid and liquid particles suspended in the air. For spherical particles of unit density, falling from a place 3 m above the ground, the settling time is 10 s for particles with a diameter of 100 \u00b5m; 4 min for 20 \u00b5m; 17 min for 10 \u00b5m; 62 min for 5 \u00b5m; while those with a diameter less than 3 \u00b5m do not settle (Tellier 2006) . Current research on RFID applications in the medical field rarely explores the potential for RFID in conjunction with infection probability. Therefore, based on the information collected with RFID tags, this study analyzed the sequence of movements performed by carries and suspected cases, calculated infection probabilities, and used tree diagram principles to reconstruct disease transmission routes. The results would provide healthcare personnel with information that helps them to quickly locate suspected cases and implement effective isolation measures.",

            "text": "The incubation period varies from disease to disease and depending on personal physique. This study uses the H1N1 virus as an example to illustrate the method of transmission route search. The empirical research was conducted in a hospital where 30 medical personnel and patients were asked to wear active tags on them from 2011/9/10 to 2011/9/15. Eighteen antennas were installed in the lobby and at the elevator and stairway entrances on four floors in the hospital. Each subject's movements in the hospital were recorded by the tracking and control database. This research simulates a situation in which a patient is tested positive for H1N1 infection. When the simulated scenario occurs, the control personnel will activate the tracking and control system right away, and then, based on the RFID records, use the infection probability model to infer potential risks of infection. A carrier of the flu virus is potentially infectious from 1 day before the onset of symptoms to 3-7 days following the onset. As shown in Table 1 , carrier C3's onset occurs on 2011/9/11 and then C3 passes by three RFID access control entry points: ID206, ID110, ID202. Yet because an H1N1 virus carrier is contagious 1 day before the onset, people who pass by ID107 on 2011/9/10 must be taken into consideration as well. In the end, the infection probability can be derived from formula (7) by entering the time interval of each person passing by. For example, in Table 1 , C2's infection probability is P 3,2 = exp(\u22120.0483 \u00b7 14.617) = 0.494. Diagnostic criteria for infection can be adjusted by healthcare personnel according to the epidemic situation. During the peak of the influenza season, the parameter of infection risk must be lowered to enforce stricter disease controls. When it is not peak Table 1 , those people with a risk value equal to or greater than 0.2 are marked in boldface in the column \"Person Passing by\" and with a \"Y\" in \"Infection Possibility\". With these people identified as potential carriers, further investigation could be conducted on patients indirectly infected. However, if the risk value is less than 0.2, the column of \"Infection Possibility\" will be marked with an \"N\", which means it signifies end of search. According to the carrier tracking and control records in Table 1 , after the onset of disease on 2011/9/11, carrier C3 passes by four access control entry points, respectively ID107, ID206, ID110, ID202. The relationship between C3 and other people that pass by the same spots can be represented with a tree diagram, as shown in Fig. 4 . The diagram can clearly show the sequence of contacts between carriers and other people to quickly find out the routes of transmission and suspected cases. The symbol \" \" stands for each access control entry point, \" \" for uninfected people, \" for suspected cases, \"\u2192\" for the transmission routes, and (T i , P i ) above each \"\u2192\" for the time interval (T i ) of contact and infection probability (P i ) between a carrier and an affected individual.",

In addition, an infection probability model is developed in this study on the basis of Duguid's and Tellier's research on the residence time of droplets (Duguid 1946; Tellier 2006) . To facilitate the search of disease transmission routes, healthcare personnel, patients and visitors in the hospital should wear RFID tags, so that their location and time data could be recorded. In case of an epidemic outbreak or once an infected case is confirmed, the disease tracking and control system could be initiated by accessing RFID logs to plot the carriers' time of onset and to trace possible routes of transmission via tree diagrams. With the information, infection control personnel can conduct a prompt search of those who might have been infected, and take immediate protection and quarantine measures to prevent the epidemic from spreading any further. This empirical study is restricted by the resources available at the hospital where the experiment was conducted. Due to the high cost of active tags, only a limited number of subjects were studied. Future research could consider adopting passive tags, which, being of a much lower price, could allow all medical personnel, patients and visitors to be included to build a more comprehensive disease control system.",
