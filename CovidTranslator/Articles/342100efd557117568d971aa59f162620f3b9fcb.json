One of the features that may explain why this novel 37 betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been successfully spreading around the globe, is the newly 38 acquired furin-like cleavage site 1 . Furin is ubiquitously expressed at different levels in all 39 tissues 2,3 . However, kinetics of furin-like enzyme activity are different among species -e. g. Table   53   S1 ). Before diving into the new features, we define major domains of SARS-CoV-2 S 54 glycoprotein, based on the available SARS-CoV-1 structure 5 : S1 subunit, that binds to the 55 receptor on the host cell surface 6 , and S2 subunit which plays a role in membrane fusion 7 . In 56 particular, S1 is composed of an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 14-294) and three C-terminal (Figure 1 ). The S2 subunit is located downstream of S1 66 after the S1/S2 cleavage site (residue 667 for SARS-CoV and residue 660 for SARS-CoV-2). The 67 majority of the residues that differentiate human S glycoproteins from bat or pangolin were found 68 within the S1 subunit ( Figure 1a ). The S glycoprotein was under strong negative/purifying 69 selection with 775 out of 1273 sites were under negative/purifying selection (Table S3) , which 70 suggests the protein has reached a peak on the fitness landscape in terms of structure, stability 71 and folding 11 . We detected six amino acid positions within the S1 subunit under ",

While the majority of the CoV 186 genome seems prone to recombination, the S glycoprotein is the only one that harbored 187 recombination coldspots. This might depend on functional costraints on specific domains of the 188 protein 34 , or other factors impacting the probability of recombination events, such as RNA 189 secondary structure 35,36 .

In the box below we show a schematic representation of the spike 329 glycoprotein is given: S1 and the S2 subunits of the S glycoprotein are indicated in grey and 330 fuchsia, while CTD1 is shown green, CTD2 in red, CTD3 in blue. Fuchsia box around the 331 residues between 333-516 are indicating the residues involved into rotation of CTD1. selection are shaded in cyan, residues that form the ACE receptor binding are 333 shaded in orange, and the acquired polybasic residues (PRRA) in the S1/S2 cleavage site in 334 yellow. (b) The monomer of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein and its three S1 domains (CTD1, CTD2, 335 and CTD3) and S2 subunit (pink) are shown in different colors: CTD1 in green, CTD2 in red, 336 CTD3 in blue. The N-terminal domain was shown is colored tan. The residues under selection, 337 ACE2 biding site residues, and S1/S2 cleavage sites were shown with cyan, orange and yellow 338 spheres, respectively. (c) Homo-trimer structure of the modeled SARS-CoV-2. Residues, S1 339 (NTD, CTD1, CTD2, and CTD3) and the S2 subunits are colored corresponding to panel b. (d) 340 The superposition of the modeled S protomer of SARS-CoV-2 with the S protomer of SARS-CoV 341 (PDB 5WRG). The missing NTD domain for SARS-CoV was not shown whereas the NTD domain 342 of SARS-CoV-2 is shown by tan color. Residues and domains are colored corresponding to panel 343 b. (e) Projection of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein MD trajectory along Essential Dynamics 344 eigenvector 1 (see also Supplementary movies 1-2). The two extreme conformations are shown 345 in i and ii. Domain colors as in panel b. The opening/closing mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 S 346 glycoprotein monomer by means of the rotation of CTD1 is evident. (f) Per-residue Root Mean 347 Square Fluctuations in nm of the filtered S glycoprotein trajectory along eigenvectors 1-3. The 348 region with higher fluctuations along eigenvector 1 is the CTD1, highlighted by red lines, since its 349 rotation in the opening/closing mechanism is the most correlated motion in the protein. The peak 350 in fluctuations observed in eigenvectors 1 and 2, involving residues 828-852, is highlighted by 351 cyan lines and is indicative of a correlated motion of this region with the opening/closing motion of 352 CTD1. Note that this region includes a portion of the fusion peptide (Suppl. Movie 3). The peak in 353 fluctuations observed in eigenvector 3 involving residues 699-718 is highlighted by orange lines.",
