This framework must be able to accommodate a diversity of scenarios on the key characteristics of the threat, and the suite of public health interventions available.

The two remaining attributes described the outcome of an infectious disease outbreak in terms of two metrics: the expected number of infections (five levels ranging from 200 to 1,000,000 cases) and the expected number of infectionrelated deaths (five levels; 0 -180 deaths). These levels were selected to span plausible ranges for emerging infectious disease outbreaks or pandemics. The DCE consisted of ten tasks that required respondents to choose between two scenarios with different levels of the seven attributes.",

By regressing respondent choices on the policy attributes and levels, we derived preference weights for each attribute-level, when all other attribute levels are held constant. The model assumes that the utility of a given scenario is a linear combination of the utilities associated with each attribute of the scenario, from interventions to outcomes, plus Gaussian noise. In addition, a hierarchical model was developed in which individuals were allowed differing utilities, the output of which was used to cluster individuals into groups.

It is not clear how effective social distancing measures would be in a mild outbreak, however, as many respondents reported that they would not voluntarily reduce how frequently they go out to eat or shop. It may be the implicit recognition of this that made the majority of participants recognize that isolation and quarantine should be mandatory rather than voluntary. Results reveal that the preferences of the population are not uniform; respondents could be broadly categorized into two groupings: one group (mortality averse) was strongly motivated to reduce the number of deaths and willing to accept interventions that did so, whereas another (expenditure averse, 37% of our respondents) was tax averse, and not in favour of any measures that might increase their taxes, even at levels comparable to the per capita costs of Singapore's routine dengue vector control program 41 . public health information might garner support from those otherwise not in favour. In Singapore, given our findings, this might involve stressing the necessity of such measures to reduce mortality, to co-opt the mortality-averse group, and to minimize the economic impact, to gain support from the sizeable taxaverse group. Studies such as this one can also identify misperceptions among the public that may hinder support for effective control. Two such examples surfaced in our study: (1) temperature screening island-wide received considerable support by our survey participants, although temperature screening at the country's main airport was estimated only to pick up around 1 imported case in 4 in 2009 25 , and was increasingly ineffective as the infection became more widespread 42 , and (2) the predicted risk of infectious disease outbreaks was considerably underestimated: 2013 saw \u223c 20 000 dengue infections in Singapore, but the mean forecast risk of an outbreak infecting at least 200 people was a mere 29%. Future studies might evaluate the effect of priming respondents with accurate public health information before eliciting their preferences.",

Prior assessment of population level preferences could help identify thresholds of epidemic severity which could serve as triggers for the implementation of more disruptive measures. In addition, information from such surveys could be used to explain the rationale for particular decisions, with hierarchical cluster analysis used to support the targeting of different messages to audiences with different values. Whereas surveys have been performed retrospectively to gauge support for government responses to specific circumstances like the SARS-CoV outbreaks in 2003 and influenza pandemic in 2009 45,46 , our method is the first conjoint analysis that quantifies public support for government interventions over a realistic range of outbreak scenarios and parameters.",

The response rate was low (41.8%) and although there were no significant differences when compared to the population age, gender, race, employment or family data, those with higher education were over-represented in our sample. A further limitation is that the study design elicits the public's preferences and trade-offs between known interventions and known outcomes of those interventions. However, at an early stage of an outbreak of a novel pathogen, policy makers face grave uncertainty about the outcomes of interventions because the characteristics of the pathogen's transmission routes and potential, the severity and symptoms of the disease it causes, and the public reaction is unpredictable. As a result, the decisions policy makers must continue to be based on scientific advice and political imperatives. Surveys such as this one permit a better understanding of those political imperatives in emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Outcome measures Demographic information was collected from each participant. Participants were also shown a series of pairs of alternatives, each combining interventions and morbidity, mortality and cost outcomes, and declared a preference for one combination.

The response rate was low (41.8%) and although there were no significant differences when compared to the population age, gender, race, employment or family data, those with higher education were over-represented in our sample. A further limitation is that the study design elicits the public's preferences and trade-offs between known interventions and known outcomes of those interventions. However, at an early stage of an outbreak of a novel pathogen, policy makers face grave uncertainty about the outcomes of interventions because the characteristics of the pathogen's transmission routes and potential, the severity and symptoms of the disease it causes, and the public reaction is unpredictable. As a result, the decisions policy makers must continue to be based on scientific advice and political imperatives. Surveys such as this one permit a better understanding of those political imperatives in emerging infectious disease outbreaks.",

Following parameter estimation (see next section), the Euclidean distance matrix used for cluster analysis was calculated from posterior mean utilities associated with each attribute and each individual. The number of latent classes was determined using the dendrogram from the cluster analysis, centroid plot from a two-group linear discriminant analysis, and elbow plot. Demographic predictors of class membership were then determined through logistic regression.Model fitting: In the main model, flat prior distributions were assigned to each \u07da and to log \u07ea.

In this paper, we aim to understand public perceptions on pandemic interventions, as well as to identify if there are any distinct respondent preference classes.Setting This study was fielded in Singapore between November 2012 and February 2013.",

The study design and statistical methods proposed in this study can be easily adapted to other settings.IntroductionThe last decade has witnessed the emergence of several emerging infectious diseases, including the first H5N1) in South East Asia 15,16 and China 17 , the WHO urged governments to develop pandemic preparedness plans 18 as it revised the International Health Regulations in 2005 19 . Details vary between countries 20,21 , and the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic of 2009 demonstrated clearly that willingness to respond also varied substantially between countries, with several Asian countries adopting more aggressive response policies 22-24 than the approach common in America and Europe, which could be described as being more proportionate to the severity of the epidemics that came to pass.In the aftermath of the 2009 influenza pandemic, particularly severe criticism was voiced from some European quarters that health authorities and the WHO over-reacted in their response to the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic of 2009 25 . Others argued that the prior experiences with SARS-CoV and H5N1 justified a robust response to the influenza A(H1N1pdm09) pandemic in 2009 22,23 . For instance, in Singapore, where SARS-CoV caused 238 infections, 33 deaths, and reduced annual GDP by 1% 26 , there was a strong governmental response, with over 8,000 contacts of SARS-CoV cases quarantined 27 .Singapore's health authorities used similarly robust measures during the influenza pandemic in 2009, and initially mandated isolation of confirmed cases, quarantining of exposed individuals, and temperature screening in hospitals, public places and ports of entry 28 . This was in spite of the paucity of evidence that such measures would make any difference to the overall course of the pandemic.Since public acceptance is vital for many outbreak response policies to have the intended effect, public health decision making must go beyond accurate assessments of the severity of a threat and what measures might be effective against it. It has to calibrate policy to the public's willingness to accept the trade-offs associated with a given response to the outbreak, and a framework is needed for assessing this while recognizing the diversity of views between and within populations as to what they value. This framework must be able to accommodate a diversity of scenarios on the key characteristics of the threat, and the suite of public health interventions available.Public health policy makers have several constituencies, but chief among these is the populace on whose behalf they make decisions. Yet, while tolerance and potential impact of interventions can (and should be) be assessed through surveys 29 , when it comes to pandemic preparedness, it is remarkable how little is known about what interventions the general population actually wants their governments to undertake. This gap is especially noteworthy due to the considerable personal burden imposed by To this end, we conducted a 'conjoint' discrete choice experiment to explore the Singapore public's willingness to accept certain containment and mitigation strategies under various outbreak scenarios, spanning a range of infection and fatality rates. Specifically we assess three broad questions: (i) Howinformed are the public about infectious disease outbreaks and the effectiveness of different interventions? (ii) How much do the public support interventions-quarantine, isolation of contacts, school closure and mass screening-that restrict civil liberties in an outbreak? (iii) How consistent are overall preferences for intervention policies throughout the population? Are there subgroups whose preferences are in opposition to the majority? We hypothesised that the population would be broadly supportive of interventions that restricted their civil liberties, but that they might be averse to monetary impacts of those interventions. Our work was motivated by the past vulnerability of Singapore to a diversity of emerging infectious disease threats such as Nipah virus in the 1990s 31 , to SARS-CoV in 2003 32 , Chikungunya in 2008 33 , pandemic influenza A(H1N1pdm09) in 2009 34 and the Zika epidemic in 2016 35 , and its perceived vulnerability to future threats, given its location at the centre of South EastAsia where various highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza continue to spread, its role as a transport hub, its highly urbanized environment and its tropical climate, which permits year round transmission of many viruses 36 . These results are hence intended to allow policy makers to identify policies which will have high levels of public support and are hence expected to translate into high levels of compliance, while exemplifying a method that can be used to address the same questions in different settings.This survey was fielded in Singapore between November 2012 and February 2013 by a market research company contracted by the authors. The sampling frame was based on a list of households obtained from the Singapore national database of dwellings and continued until 500 responses with written informed consent were obtained, which required 1,196 households to be contacted (yielding an unadjusted response rate of 41.8%). Respondent eligibility could not be determined in 41 households.",
