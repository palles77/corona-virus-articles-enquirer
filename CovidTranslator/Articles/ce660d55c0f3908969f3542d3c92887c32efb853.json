In this study, an analytical method using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high resolution gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC-HRMS) was developed to measure dioxins and chlorinated derivatives from triclosan in the presence of active chlorine in seawater matrix. Formation yields of dioxins and chlorinated triclosans were assessed at different initial precursor concentrations under dark and UV light irradiation conditions. Results showed that triclosan was rapidly transformed to its chlorinated derivatives, i.e. tetraclosans and pentaclosans, of which the formation yields peaked after 1 h of reaction. UV light was the key factor to promote the formation of dioxins. With the same initial triclosan/active chlorine ratio, the highest yield of dioxins was observed with lower initial concentrations of triclosan under UV irradiation. Five dioxins, including 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, and 2, 3, 7, were identified and quantified. 2, 3, 7, , the most toxic dioxin, was firstly reported as the phototransformation product of triclosan in aquatic solution. Results presented here are useful for a comprehensive understanding of the fate and toxicity of triclosan in contaminated waters.",

It is suspected that a large amount of household disinfectants and antiseptics containing triclosan were used after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 due to the need to against SARS coronavirus [1] . Being an anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agent, triclosan has also been included in a wide range of pharmaceutical and personal care products since then [2] . This leads to the discharge of a large amount of triclosan in densely populated cities such as Hong Kong, via domestic sewage effluent. Studies have revealed that triclosan would degrade to dioxins when exposed to sunlight in wastewater and seawater [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . It has been detected not only in rivers and lakes in Hong Kong [8] [9] [10] , but also in the human serum of Hong Kong residents [11] , indicating a widespread triclosan exposure in the region.",

Long term exposure of triclosan could also promote liver fibrogenesis and tumorigenesis in mice, and the mechanism of triclosan-induced mouse liver toxicity may be relevant to human [13] . One of the main concerns about the environmental fate of triclosan is the formation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins through photo-degradation [14, 15] . It is commonly known that dioxins are potent multisite carcinogens, and of all the dioxin congeners, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (2, 3, 7, is the most toxic [16, 17] . Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the potential adverse human health effects resulting from the long-term exposure to triclosan and its photo-transformation products, e.g. dioxins, could be even more severe than that expected from the triclosan-only exposure.",

In another study conducted by this group, solid state triclosan and its three above-mentioned chlorinated derivatives were exposed to sunlight on a glass plate for 18 h, and all these above-mentioned dioxins including 1,2,3,8-TeCDD were determined [20] . In the subsequent photo-transformation studies of triclosan, 2,8-DCDD was identified as one of the major transformation products in aqueous environments through a photochemical cyclization reaction [5] [6] [7] [21] [22] [23] . However, none of these studies reported 2,3,7,8-TeCDD as the transformation product of triclosan in the environment.",

Obviously, more laboratory studies on their aqueous photo-transformation and chlorination chemistry are needed to comprehensively investigate their roles in the formation of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in aquatic environments, especially in the presence of chlorine. In this study, a sample preparation method using acidic silica gel/acidic alumina/florisil columns was developed to extract the trace amount of dioxin derivatives from samples solutions containing triclosan and its chlorinated derivatives. The enriched dioxin derivatives were then quantitatively analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high resolution GC-high resolution MS (HRGC-HRMS). Using this developed analytical technique, we are not only able to characterize dioxins and chlorinated triclosans from the transformation of triclosan in the presence of active chlorine in seawater mixture, but also investigated their formation yields and possible formation mechanisms and pathways under both dark and UV irradiation conditions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to identify 2,3,7,8-TeCDD as the aquatic photo-transformation product of triclosan in the presence of active chlorine. This indicates potential adverse human health effects could be caused by the long-term exposure to triclosan and its transformation products in the aquatic environment.",

The experiment was performed at room temperature (about 25\u2103) and one electric fan was used to cool down the temperature inside the reactor. Seawater collected from Tai Po Harbor in Hong Kong was filtered and used as the matrix solution, because our previous study showed that it contains very low level of triclosan and no photo-transformation products were detected in it [9] . Given the wide use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) as a disinfectant/bleaching agent in daily life and its presence in environmental waters, NaOCl was chosen as the free chlorine precursor in this experiment. Free chlorine stock solutions were prepared using purified grade NaOCl (Acros Organics, New Jersey, USA). The concentration of total active chlorine in the sample solution is the sum of [HOCl] and [OCl \u2212 ], and it was measured by the DPD/FAS titrimetric method. Total triclosan includes triclosan and phenolate-triclosan. Given the pKa values of HClO and triclosan are 7.5 and 7.9 respectively, and the pH of seawater matrix was between 7.5 and 8.4, the predominant active chlorine and triclosan species got involved in the experimental system were HClO and phenolate-triclosan.",

The limit of detection (LOD) was defined as the concentration of the analyte required to produce a signal with amplitude of at least 3 times of the baseline noise (S/N \u2265 3). The LODs of tricolsan and dioxins were found to be within the range of 0.44-1.16 pg\u00b7mL \u22121 for GC-MS analysis and 0.032 to 0.11 pg\u00b7mL \u22121 for HRGC-HRMS (Table S1 ), which were well below the levels of these compounds observed in the water samples.",

The photo-degradation products of triclosan in seawater were first treated by liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed by GC-MS in full scan mode. As shown in Fig.1 , many products were detected in the triclosan photo-transformation experiment, including several dioxins and chlorinated triclosan derivatives. Three tetraclosans, i.e. 5-chloro-2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)phenol (tetraclosan 1), 5,6-dichloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol (tetraclosan 2), and 4,5-dichloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol (tetraclosan 3), and two pentaclosans, i.e. 4,5-dichloro-2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)phenol (pentaclosan 1) and 4,5,6-trichloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol (pentaclosan 2) were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the previously reported data [19, 20, 25, 29] and their retention times relative to other known compounds in the GC chromatograms. Several dioxins, such as 2,8-DCDD, 2,3,7-TrCDD, 1,2,8-TrCDD, were also detected by GC-MS. However, for 2,3,7,8-TeCDD (43.4 min) and 1,2,3,8-TeCDD (43.8 min), their retention times were close to that of tetraclosan 2 (43.2 min). Since the concentration of tetraclosan 2 was much higher than these two TeCDDs, they were buried underneath the huge peak of tetraclosan 2 and could not be seen in Fig. 1 . Therefore, further cleanup of the sample using the tandem acid silica gel/acidic alumina/ florisil SPE columns was performed to remove triclosan and its chlorinated derivatives. The dioxin products were then identified and quantified using both GC-MS and HRGC-HRMS. . The former was determined as 2,3,7-TrCDD by comparing to the authentic standard and the latter (Figs. S1B and S2B), was identified as 1,2,8-TrCDD, which was also reported by Kanetoshi et al. [19, 20] . The two tetracholorodibenzo-p-dioxins, 2,3,7,8-and 1,2,3,8-TeCDDs, were clearly observed in the cleaned sample, with their retention times and mass spectra well matched those of the standards (Figs. S1C and S2C) .",

As mentioned earlier, dioxins were often considered as the photo-transformation products of triclosan. Our finding suggested that under weak base (NaOCl) condition, triclosan could be transformed to dioxins in the presence of excessive active chlorine even in dark. However, their formation rates were rather slow and the formation yields of dioxins decreased with increasing number of chlorine substitutes. As shown in Fig. 3, 2,8 -DCDD could be formed through a slow cyclization reaction of triclosan under this condition. Contrary to dioxins, much higher levels of chlorinated triclosan derivatives were observed in the system. Almost all of them reached their highest concentrations at 120 min, and gradually decayed as reaction continued for 64 days (Table 2) . Several studies have reported the production of tetraclosan 2 and 3 and pentaclosan 2 from aquatic triclosan chlorination. These three chlorinated triclosan derivatives were proposed to be formed via bimolecular electrophilic substitution of triclosan and their formation was kinetically favorable [24, 25] . Results shown in Table 2 confirmed that these three chlorinated triclosans were the major degradation products of triclosan in dark in the presence of free chlorines. Besides, small amounts of tetraclosan 1 and pentaclosan 1 were also detected and the formation pathways of all measured chlorinated triclosans were proposed in Fig. 4 [3, 32] . Similar to triclosan, these chlorinated derivatives may also undergo a slow cyclization reaction in dark, which led to the formation of TrCDD and TeCDD in the system (Fig. 3) .",

With the same initial concentrations of triclosan and free chlorines, much more dioxins were formed under UV radiation and all of them, including 2,3,7,8-TeCDD were detected as the photo-transformation products of triclosan, given enough reaction time. Among the measured dioxin products, TrCDDs were the most abundant, followed by DCDD and TeCDDs. Concentrations of almost all dioxins increased with increasing reaction time, except for 2,8-DCDD, which peaked after 120 min of radiation and then gradually decreased as reaction continued for 16 h. This demonstrated that 2,8-DCDD was the first generation product from the photolysis of triclosan and it would further degrade to form the higher generation products. One of the possibility was 2,8-DCDD could generate a biradical intermediate upon photochemical excitation, which led to the production of dihydroxy dichlorinated biphenyls and lower chlorinated phenoxyphenols [33] .

It is interesting to note that with the same initial triclosan/active chlorine ratio, a higher yield of dioxins was observed in the experiment with lower concentrations of triclosan and free chlorines. Given that the chlorination reactions of triclosan were kinetically favorable, this phenomenon was probably due to the higher possibility for triclosan to undergo chlorination, instead of photolysis when a higher level of active chlorines was present in the system (Fig. 4) [34] .",

We also proposed that 2,3,7,8-TeCDD and 1,2,3,8-TeCDD were the 3 rd generation products from the transformation of triclosan through the direct photolysis of pentaclosan 1 and 2, respectively ( Fig. 4) [33] . Therefore, it was not surprising to observe that TrCDD had the highest formation yield of all three types of dioxins and TeCDD had the lowest. It was worth noting that the formation yield of pentaclosan 2 was about a thousand times higher than that of pentaclosan 1 under the same experimental conditions (Table 2) . Similarly, a much lower yield of tetraclosan 1 was observed than those of tetraclosan 2 and 3. This indicated that the pathway to form 2,3,7,8-TeCDD was minor, compared with those pathways to form TrCDD and 1,2,3,8-TeCDD. However, no significant difference was observed between the yields of 1,2,3,8-TeCDD and 2,3,7,8-TeCDD (Table 1) . This indicated that another photo-transformation pathway might exist for 2,3,7,8-TeCDD. Overall, the formation yields of total dioxins were rather low, which was below 1.2% under the tested conditions. As a result, a logarithmic function between the yield of dioxins and reaction time was observed (Figs. 3A, 3C and 3D) .",

            "text": "The formation yields of all chlorinated triclosans reached their maximum values after 60 min of reaction and then gradually decayed as reaction continued (Fig. 6 ). As shown in Fig. 6B , the formation yields of tetraclosans were about the same under dark and light conditions, which indicated that light was not the key factor to promote the formation nor transformation of these compounds (Fig. 4) . However, for pentaclosans, their total formation yield was much lower under UV irradiation than that in dark. This indicated that photolysis was an important pathway for the decay of pentaclosans, which might be more significant than the further chlorination of these compounds. This is because pentaclosans possess higher pKa values than that of triclosan (pKa = 7.9-8.1) [35, 36] . In the weak basic solution, a smaller fraction of them was in the phenolate forms, and therefore less reacted with active chlorines to get further chlorinated. Besides TeCDDs, other photo-transformation products of pentaclosans could be dihydroxy polychlorinated biphenyls and lower chlorinated phenoxyphenols [33] , although they were not monitored in our study. It was interesting to note that the formation yields of tetrachlosans and pentaclosans were almost the same under the two photolysis experiments. Obviously, it was the initial triclosan/active chlorine ratio but not the initial concentrations of these two precursors that really influenced the production of chlorinated triclosans from triclosan under UV irradiation.",

Both UV light and the initial concentrations of triclosan and active chlorine played important roles in the photo-transformation of triclosan to dioxins. Higher yield of dioxins was observed in the experiment with lower concentrations of triclosan and free chlorines and TrCDDs were found to be the most abundant dioxin products. On the other hand, the formation yields of chlorinated triclosans from triclosan was mainly influenced by the initial triclosan/active chlorine ratio, and UV light promotes the transformation of these compounds to dioxins, including the most toxic 2,3,7,8-TeCDD. Possible formation mechanisms of dioxins and chlorinated triclosan derivatives from the transformation of triclosan under both dark and UV irradiation conditions were proposed. Results from this study suggest that the transformation products of triclosan could be even more toxic and persistent in the environment than itself. More public awareness should be paid to the potential adverse human health effect resulting from the long-term exposure to triclosan and its transformation products in environmental waters.",
