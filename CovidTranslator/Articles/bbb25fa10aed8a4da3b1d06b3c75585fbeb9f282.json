These challenges include coordination between different agencies, as well as between different levels of government (local, provincial, national), which is a hallmark of risk communication, before, during, and after an emergency. However, in China, a top-down command system drives emergency response, such as the response typically observed during floods. 8 This approach has provided a successful model for emergency response in China, but the limited interaction between agencies and levels of government at other times limits the effectiveness of prevention and response activities.",

Further, the public in general has not been viewed as a partner, something that can improve the public's response to risk messaging. 5 Increasing coordination among government agencies and involving the public as a partner can result in improvements to emergency response. This process to improve risk communication also includes understanding some of the common misconceptions about disasters, including fears of mass panic, concerns with motivating people to act (such as for an evacuation), and understating the resiliency of those affected by a disaster, all of which can negatively influence risk communication efforts. 11 Emergency planners must recognize the nature of risk perception and how populations actually respond during an emergency. Evidence shows that when people are treated as partners in the process (with fairness, honesty, and respect), those people are more likely to appropriately react and respond to the risk messages being communicated. 12 The Fukushima nuclear crisis in 2011 provides a stark reminder of how important it is to understand and engage your audience when attempting to communicate risk. The majority of the Japanese public was only expected to be exposed to very low doses of radiation, but that did not change the fact that accurate information should still have been provided. 13 In the days after the crisis a lack of accurate information made the situation worse, providing further evidence that adequate planning is required to provide effective risk communications during an emergency. 13 Public perception can also change over time or after a significant event, as supported by research in China before and after the Fukushima nuclear crisis. Surveys administered to residents living near a nuclear power plant before and after the Fukushima nuclear crisis showed significant changes in the perception of risk with regard to nuclear power, demonstrating the need to continually assess and understand the target audience and to make appropriate changes to risk communication messaging. 14 A previous assessment in China demonstrated that the public responded better to messages that were crafted by public health workers trained in risk communication and that contained risk communication principles. 15 These findings provided justification to continue enhancing risk communication in China and routinely evaluate those efforts.",

The law states that only the NHFPC or provincial department of health can release information related to disease epidemics and other public health emergencies. Therefore, if an administrative health department or provincial CDC identifies information related to an outbreak or other health emergency, it is not permitted to immediately release such information and must wait for the NHFPC or provincial department of health to do so. They are only permitted to release general recommendations and information, such as monthly reports, but nothing specific to a newly identified situation. This approach can result in critical delays in providing information to the public.",
