The disease is endemic in many regions, such as Africa, Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Central Asia. 1 Ixodid ticks, especially those of the genus Hyalomma, are both a reservoir and a vector for the virus. The CCHF virus (CCHFV), a Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae, has been isolated from 30 species of ixodid tick. 2 Numerous domestic and wild animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep, small mammals, rodents, and birds, in which the infection is mainly asymptomatic, serve as amplifying hosts for the virus. 3 There is no specific treatment or vaccine against CCHF and it is considered an emerging arboviral zoonotic disease in many countries, possibly due to increased vector bionomics and climate change.",

Despite the rapidly growing incidence of the disease, there are currently no accurate data on the burden of the disease in the region due to the different surveillance systems for CCHF used in these countries. Moreover, there is no definitive preventive and control strategy for CCHF owing to the fact that many aspects of the disease, such as the maintenance and transmission of the virus and the pathogenesis of the disease in humans, remain poorly understood. 4 In an effort to increase our understanding of the epidemiology and risk factors for the transmission of CCHFV in the WHO EMR, and to identify current knowledge gaps that are hindering effective control interventions, a sub-regional meeting was organized in Muscat, Oman from December 7 to 9, 2015. This article summarizes the outcomes of that meeting concerning current knowledge of the disease in the region and the future directions for research and control.",

            "text": "Historical evidence points to the probable description of CCHF by a physician in Tajikistan in 1100 AD in a patient with haemorrhagic manifestations. 2, 5 In recent times, the disease was first recognized during an outbreak in Crimea in 1944; however, it later became evident that the causative agent was identical to a virus isolated from a patient in Congo in 1956, and the name CCHF was adopted. 1 The disease is endemic in many regions, such as Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. 1 The known distribution of CCHFV covers the greatest geographic range of any tick-borne virus and there are reports of viral isolation and/or disease from more than 30 countries across four regions: Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Mauritania, Nigeria, South Africa, Senegal, Sudan), Asia (China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India), Europe (Russia, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, Spain), and the Middle East (Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE)). 6 The geographic distribution of CCHF coincides with that of ixodid ticks, particularly those of the genus Hyalomma. In Europe, Hyalomma marginatum is the main CCHFV vector, while Hyalomma asiaticum appears to be the principal vector in Asia. In 2006, H. marginatum was detected for the first time in the Netherlands and in southern Germany. 7, 8 Additionally, CCHFV was reported for the first time in India in January 2011, linked to Hyalomma anatollicum ticks. 9 Given the wide distribution of the Hyalomma vector, the numerous animals that can serve as hosts, and the favourable climatic and ecologic conditions in several European countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, it is possible that the incidence of CCHF may increase geographically over the region in the future. Hyalomma ticks favour dry climates and arid types of vegetation, in areas with abundant small and large mammals that can support haematophagy and the different stages of the tick life-cycle. Environmental factors (such as climate) and human behaviour are critical determinants for the establishment and maintenance of CCHF endemicity within an area. Humans may modify the risk of CCHFV transmission through changes in land use, recreational activities, and movement and trade of infected livestock. 10 Characterized by fever and haemorrhage and often with nonspecific prodromal symptoms, CCHFV infection can be difficult to distinguish clinically from other causes of undifferentiated febrile illness and other viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs). It has a case fatality rate ranging from 5% to 80%. 11 Humans are infected by the bite of or by crushing an infected tick against bare skin. The infection can also be acquired by percutaneous and permucosal routes, through contact with animal blood or tissues. The possibility of aerosol transmission has been suspected in a few instances in Russia, but no definite evidence exists. 12, 13 Only one study has suggested possible sexual transmission of CCHFV, 14 but further research is needed to study the persistence of CCHFV in the body fluids of survivors. Livestock and abattoir workers, as well as individuals involved in backyard slaughtering in endemic areas, remain at an increased risk of infection due to the risk of occupational exposure.",

The lack of early diagnosis poses the highest risk of nosocomial transmission to health care personnel, where transmission due to splash and needle-stick injuries has occurred in the absence of adequate personal protective equipment. 19 Geographic distribution and epidemiology of CCHF in the Eastern Mediterranean Region",

In some countries, the incidence of CCHF has been increasing steadily in recent years. 21 Moreover, serological studies among livestock have identified the presence of the disease in Egypt, Somalia, and Tunisia. The disease is reportedly endemic in Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan, particularly in the areas bordering these countries where frequent movement of nomads with their animals is concentrated. Trade in animals and animal skins within Pakistan, and between Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan, is thought to play a major role in the spread of CCHFV among people who handle animals or their skins, slaughter infected animals, and/or come into close contact with ticks or CCHF patients.",

            "text": "CCHFV is endemic and widespread in Afghanistan, with 5-50 human cases reported every year. The first case was reported in 1998. 22 The most severe outbreak of CCHF reported to date occurred in 2008, between July 10 and October 22, in the city of Herat in the western region: 30 human cases were reported, including nine deaths (proportion of 30%). 23 A cross-sectional seroprevalence survey conducted during this outbreak showed a CCHF IgG prevalence of 11.2% among livestock-owning households. Surveyed livestock showed a very high IgG prevalence (75.0%), underscoring the risk of exposure for people having frequent contact with cattle. 24, 25 In Iran, antibodies to CCHFV in sheep and cattle were first detected in 1970. 26 However, the first confirmed human case of CCHF was diagnosed in Iran in August 1999, when a patient died of severe gastrointestinal bleeding at a hospital in the southwest part of the country. 27 The transmission of CCHFV is most commonly associated with exposure to the blood or viscera of infected livestock. [28] [29] [30] Tick bites also account for significant transmission in humans. 27 Since 1999, CCHF has been reported in 26 of the 31 provinces of Iran, with the greatest numbers of cases in Sistan and Baluchestan, Isfahan, Fars, Tehran, Khorasan, and Khuzestan. Only five provinces (Mazandaran, Ardabil, Ilam, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, and Alborz) have not reported human infections, but at least two of these are known to have cattle and ticks harbouring CCHFV. 31, 32 Nosocomial infection with CCHFV has been reported during some outbreaks in the country. 33 After the establishment of a comprehensive CCHF surveillance programme for humans and animals in Iran, a total of 3817 suspected human infections were reported between 2000 and 2015, of which 1068 were laboratory-confirmed; the case fatality rate was 14%. The detection of IgG in livestock revealed that 35.8% of 5842 sera were positive for CCHFV IgG. Sistan and Baluchistan Province, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, showed the highest infection rate in the country. 34 In Pakistan, CCHF was first reported in Rawalpindi in 1976 and since then there has been a biannual surge of CCHF cases in the country. 35 Pakistan is an endemic country and has the fourth highest number of cases of CCHFV infection in Asia, after Turkey, Russia, and Iran. 23, 36 Cases usually appear between March and May and again between August and October. Several outbreaks of the disease have been reported in the country, spread over a wide geographic area. Baluchistan, Karachi, and Rawalpindi are the most affected regions. 20, 21, 36 Nosocomial outbreaks continue to occur in the country despite the dissemination of information regarding preventive measures among medical staff.",

A total of 10 cases were reported from this outbreak in Kordofan. Serosurveys also showed CCHFV infection in eight patients for whom serum samples were available. 16 Exposure of cattle to CCHFV and the recognized potential risk factors associated with disease were confirmed by a serosurvey of CCHFV in cattle. This study indicated a prevalence rate of 7% CCHFV IgG in cattle in the North Kordofan region. 38 Among the Gulf countries, 4% of serological samples tested in two hospitals in Kuwait between December 1979 and October 1982 were positive for CCHFV. 39 No human cases have been reported in the country so far. CCHFV infection was recognized for the first time in Oman in 1995, when the disease occurred in three unrelated cases and a subsequent case occurred in August 1996. 40 One study of individuals who kept animals revealed that 30.3% of non-Omani citizens and 2.4% of Omani citizens were CCHFV antibody-positive. 40 In the summer of June 2011, the first case of CCHF for 15 years was observed in Oman. 41 In October 2014, a total of 18 human cases, including one death, were reported across a number of Omani governorates.

            "text": "CCHF was first reported in the United Arab Emirates (UEA) in 1979, when six cases were reported among the staff of a hospital in Dubai. 45 An outbreak of CCHF occurred during 1994-1995 with 35 human infections. A molecular investigation showed that this outbreak was multisource from Pakistan, Madagascar, and Somalia, possibly due to the importation of infected livestock from these areas. 46 Subsequently, 35 clinical CCHF cases were reported in 1994, 47 and between January 1998 and October 2013, another five cases and two deaths were reported from the UAE. 23 In Middle Eastern countries, a seasonality of CCHF has been detected in relation to Eid-al-Adhathe Muslim Festival of Sacrifice. This festival occurs annually during the Hajj (the annual pilgrimage to Mecca) and is an important Eid celebration for Muslims around the world. During the festival, Muslims sacrifice animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, or camels. Generally Muslims slaughter the animals themselves. The dates in the Islamic calendar for Eid-Al-Adha move forward by 10 days each year according to the Gregorian calendar. In the past, Eid-al-Adha has occurred in the autumn or winter months, but in the next 10-15 years, the festival will occur in the summer months when animals are more likely to be viraemic and infectious for CCHFV, since ticks are more likely to be or to have recently been feeding on these animals. This may lead to an increase in the number of CCHFV infections as a result of careless practices during the slaughtering of animals, inadequate knowledge of the disease, and the dissemination of CCHFV through uncontrolled animal movements in and between countries. 14 In a survey in Tunisia conducted in 2014, of the 181 febrile patients, only five showed high IgM titres suggesting recent exposure to CCHFV. 48 Among 38 slaughterhouse workers, two had IgG anti-CCHFV responses, yielding a seroprevalence of 5.2%. No CCHFV was detected in ticks or sera. 48 In Egypt, 49, 50 Syria, and Somalia, 40 CCHFV-specific IgG has been confirmed or detected in animals; however, there has been no evidence of viral infection in humans. In Morocco, CCHFV nucleic acid has been detected in ticks removed from migratory birds. 51 No data are available for the remaining countries of the region -Bahrain, Djibouti, Lebanon, Libya, occupied Palestine territory, Qatar, and Yemen.",

So far Africa 2 (clade II) has not been reported in the WHO EMR. 52 In 2016, a CCHF patient infected with an AP92-like strain (Europe 2), which was originally associated with Greece (clade VI), died in the north of Iran. [53] [54] [55] Recent studies have revealed a new strain (Iran-Kerman/22), which shows unique S-segment phylogenies and which constitutes a unique clade (provisionally identified as clade VII). 56 Recombination in the S-segment of CCHFV has also been reported in Iran. 57 In Sudan, another study identified the circulation of multiple CCHFV lineages in the Kordofan region. 58 The broad genetic diversity of CCHFV in Iran reflects the variety of viruses found in neighbouring countries. Iran shares the Asia 1 strain with Pakistan and Afghanistan, Asia 2 with Central Asia, Europe 2 with Greece, and Europe 1 with Turkey. 59, 60 Transmission mode Competent vectors, especially Hyalomma spp ticks, are distributed widely throughout the region. Disease transmission is common via tick bite or exposure to the blood or viscera of infected livestock. Nosocomial infection is also reported in some of the countries in the region, such as Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, Afghanistan, and the UAE. Although sexual transmission was suggested in one study, further studies are necessary to investigate CCHFV persistence in the body fluids of survivors, notably semen. Similarly studies are required to study the clinical course of CCHF in pregnant women, as well as pregnancy and infant outcomes, fertility in women who have conceived after CCHF, and viral persistence in pregnancy-related body fluids and breast milk.",

Low levels of awareness concerning CCHF symptoms at the early stages of the disease, especially at the primary care level and in hospital departments for non-communicable diseases, has led to clinical diagnostic mistakes, inappropriate case management, and poor infection control measures. A key problem here is that the surveillance case definition for human infection of CCHF is not standardized, 4,7 and different endemic countries use different case definitions. This represents a major gap and may contribute to the varied mortality rates across countries. Some countries, for example, only report patients with severe disease and bleeding at a late stage, which results in artificially very high mortality rates, while others have more sensitive systems for early case detection, even when clinical symptoms of haemorrhage are not apparent, resulting in lower mortality rates. 23 Thus, there is a need for consensus in establishing a standard case definition for CCHF. An algorithm for early identification and diagnosis of cases would be of great value.",

However, specific IgM and IgG antibodies appear late in the course of infection (5-7 days after the onset of symptoms) and in some circumstances may never be detected. The presence of CCHFV in the blood of a patient can be diagnosed early by detecting viral RNA using RT-PCR. 52 Unfortunately, the CCHFV RNA RT-PCR diagnostic test is most commonly performed in reference laboratories . In consequence, diagnostic reports may take 3-5 days or even longer to become available. Given the fact that early diagnosis of CCHF is of paramount importance for infection control and to establish early effective symptomatic treatment, there is an urgent need to develop a simple rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or point-of-care nucleic acid test (NAT) for CCHFV. Ideally these tests should be based on the detection of specific CCHF nucleic acids or antigens. The use of accurate and simple-to-use diagnostic assays would enhance early diagnosis and case detection in the primary care setting. In this context, it would be useful if a range of CCHFV-positive samples from the affected countries could be collected and stored in accessible biobanks in order to facilitate the development and validation of point-of-care RDTs and NATs for CCHFV infection. Such RDTs would be used at the point of care and would help with the rapid control of human CCHFV infection.",

Generally this includes the basic management of symptoms with intravenous fluids and blood products (platelets, fresh frozen plasma). There is evidence that early diagnosis and prompt management of the symptoms of cases with supportive treatment results in a better clinical outcome. 61 Currently, there is no approved antiviral treatment for CCHF. Ribavirin has been used by a number of countries for treatment. Although some studies have shown it to be effective at inhibiting viral replication of CCHFV in vitro and in vivo and it is approved by the WHO for the treatment of CCHFV infection, the clinical efficacy of ribavirin in humans remains contested and discussions are mired by inadequate study designs and sample sizes. The majority of studies have been in the form of case reports and small observational studies and there is a lack of large placebo-controlled, prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs). [62] [63] [64] Furthermore, studies that have used meta-analyses of such observational cohort data have characterized the quality of evidence as very low and concluded that uncertainty remains regarding the efficacy of ribavirin. 65, 66 A more recent study focusing on oral or intravenous ribavirin treatment in CCHF patients showed no effect on viral load or disease progression. 67, 68 Additionally a systematic review from Turkey recently determined that the treatment of CCHF patients with ribavirin over the years 2002 to 2015 did not benefit these patients. 69 Meanwhile, other reports have illustrated the efficacy of ribavirin if administered in the early stages of the diseasewithin 1-2 days from the onset of symptoms. 70 When administered within the 1-2-day window, ribavirin was found to be effective in reducing the case fatality rate of mild cases. 71 The recommended doses of ribavirin for the treatment of CCHF are based on clinical experience; there is no reported ribavirin dose-finding study for the treatment of CCHF. Since most published articles regarding the efficacy of ribavirin are reporting observational retrospective studies, there is a need for an RCT for efficacy studies in order to evaluate the use and dose of ribavirin for treating CCHFV infections in humans. Studies to determine viral load and the pathogenic and immunological responses at various clinical stages of the disease are also needed in order to develop a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CCHF disease in humans.",
