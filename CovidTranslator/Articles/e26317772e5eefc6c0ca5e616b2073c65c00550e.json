However, after years of hard work, the important role of intensivists, as a coordinator during patient evaluation and treatment, has gradually been recognized and respected by other specialties. Junior physicians interested in critical care training can choose to be intensivists after they fi nish 3 or 4 years of fellowship training in surgery or internal medicine. However, the traditional specialties often still assume responsibility for or 'ownership' of patients, as well as have a desire to treat critically ill patients, as refl ected by the fact that the proposal for setting up a critical care society under the Chinese Medical Association (CMA) was rejected in 1996.",

Epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, of Streptococcus suis in 2005, and of avian infl uenza, as well as the Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008, caused extreme anxiety in the public due to the vulnerability of the general population, the high communicability of the diseases, and the high case fatality rate. Th erefore, intensivists were often convened by the government to be involved in crisis management very early [6] . Th eir ability to coordinate, cooperate, and communicate with regard to both patient management and policy-making was well demonstrated during daily work, and recognised by the general public and healthcare authorities. As a result, critical care medicine was offi cially recognized as a specialty of clinical medicine in 2009 [7] .",

We used the search terms 'intensive care unit' or 'intensive care' or 'critical care unit' and 'survey' , and found only eight relevant papers concerning critical care resources in mainland China [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] that were published within the past decade (Table 2) . Unfortunately, none of these eight papers selected a representative sample of ICUs in China. Table 2 summarizes data from these eight papers [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , in addition to those of the China Critical Care Clinical Trial Group (CCCCTG) [16] . Based on the above data, we made a rough estimation that, in mainland China, ICU beds might account for 1.8% (interquartile range 1.3% to 2.1%) of total hospital beds [8] [9] [10] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . In 2008, the Ministry of Health reported that there were a total of 2,882,862 beds in 19,712 hospitals in China [3] . Th erefore, we estimate that there were 51,891 (37,477 to 60,540) ICU beds in China in 2008, corresponding to 3.91 (2.82 to 4.56) ICU beds per 100,000 population, with 217 hospital beds per 100,000 population. Th is fi gure is comparable to that of the United Kingdom (3.5 ICU beds per 100,000 population), which was the lowest of eight countries in North America and Western Europe [17] .",

Although access to state-of-the-art advances might be available during national and international conferences, basic knowledge and skills are inadequately, and sometimes incorrectly, taught in many hospitals. For the past 5 years, the CSCCM has dedicated itself to promoting professional education with regard to basic knowledge and skills in critical care medicine. Th e CSCCM successfully organizes a Fundamental Critical Care Support course, a Funda mental Disaster Management course, and a Multiprofessional Critical Care Review Course, with support from the SCCM. In 2007, the CSCCM endorsed the Basic Assessment and Support Intensive Care course, and promoted the course in mainland China. Nine provider courses have been organized until November 2009, with more than 220 participants. However, an advanced training program is still under development, and the number of trainees is very limited compared with the large number of intensivists in mainland China.",
