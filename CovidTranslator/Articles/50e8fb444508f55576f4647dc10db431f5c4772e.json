Our methodology allows a quantification of the metabolic differences between different species from a broad range of families and even kingdoms. This quantification is then applied in order to reconstruct phylogenetic trees for sets of various organisms.",

The algorithm filters isosenzymes, or other repeated reactions, and may add missing reactions to a given pathway using a probabilistic criterion based on the comparison of the organism's pathway with the same pathway in other organisms.

One is the metabolic network build-up from the chemical reactions contained in an organism's metabolism. In this network, each metabolite represents a node (or vertex), and each link (or edge) is associated with a pair of nodes if their respective metabolites are connected as a substrate and product by some reaction. The second kind of network is the complete weighted network where each vertex represents an organism and each edge connecting two nodes is weighted by the parameter measuring the metabolic distance between the organisms' metabolism (note that this will be a complete network, where all vertices are connected to all others). In order to distinguish clearly the two networks in the text, we will talk about nodes and links for the metabolic network while for the organisms' network we will use the terms vertices and edges. As for the notation, we use capital letters (N, V, E) for the network, nodes, and links in the metabolic networks and curly letters (N \u201a V\u201a E) for the network, vertices, and edges in the organisms' network. In the metabolic network we will use roman lowercase letters for indices representing single metabolites in sums, while for the organisms network we use Greek letters for the indices representing single organisms.",

Here, V A stands for the set of nodes of A, and E A stands for its set of links. A metabolic model comprises a set of chemical reactions. Each chemical reaction associates a set of substrates with a set of products. For constructing the network, first we define the set of nodes V A as the set of compounds in A (metabolites present in the model), assigning a node to each metabolite. The chemical reactions in the model will define the links of the network. If two metabolites appear as a substrate and as a product, respectively, in a chemical reaction, a link connecting the correspondent nodes is added to the network. A typical metabolic model of a prokaryote, with around 1000 metabolites and the same number of chemical reactions, becomes through this process a nondirected connected network with 1000 nodes and approximately 3000 links.",

This weighting of p AyB,i with the inverse of deg(v i ) will reduce the importance of very connected metabolites (hubs) that are common to most organisms and adds weight to specific metabolites that might be particular for a branch in the tree of life, helping in this way to differentiate the branches.

PCC 6803 (syn), Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (syf), Synechococcus elongatus PCC6301 (syc), Clostridium beijerinckii (cbe), Burkhoderia cenocepacia J2315 (bcj), Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 (eco), Thermotoga maritima (tma), and Yersinia pestis KIM10 (ypk). In Figures 3 and 4 we present the two phylogenetic trees that we have constructed. In the first tree, the only organism displaced in relation to what is expected from standard methods of phylogenetic tree reconstruction is the tma. In both trees mge (and mpm in the second one) diverges from other organisms at the beginning of the tree. This happens because of their minimalistic genomes, with only a couple hundred metabolites in their metabolomes. As a result, when compared with an organism without a reduced genome with almost a thousand metabolites, several hundred metabolites will not have a correspondent one, increasing hugely the value of a in the calculation of the parameter f, and therefore distancing these organisms from the rest. The problem with these parasitic organisms has been noticed elsewhere (Fukami-Kobayashi et al., 2007) , but unfortunately the solution found in this article did not yield better results in our present study. One should keep in mind that the present approach only considers genes (and proteins) associated with metabolic reactions and moreover, considers only the existence/absence of the enzymes (reactions). Our work yields results that are very close to the tree of life, in spite of using only a subset of all genome's information. It was not our intention to build trees that would address properly minimal organisms' phylogenies, but to prove the feasibility of building those trees using only reactome data. In any case, for the second study we used organisms from very different origins in the evolutionary history, and we found that the method is able to separate bacteria, archea, and eukaryotes. Different strains of the same species also appear closely related and share branches with organisms from the same family and order.",

From this process one obtains an ensemble of N t values of f for the comparison (one from each version of the organism in the knock-out ensemble), from which one calculates its average and standard deviation. This standard deviation is treated as an indicator of the sensibility of the parameter (as a function of the number of knock-outs). We performed this sensibility analysis for four organisms (syn, syf, eco, and mge) with ensembles of sizes N t = 500 for n K = 5, 10, 50, and 100. The results are shown in Tables 5 through 8. These four organisms have been chosen to observe the sensibility in the comparison between very similar organisms (syn and syf), more distant ones (syn and eco), and very different ones (syn and mge).",

Since the distance parameter is based on metabolic models, one relies in the genome annotations for each organism and any annotation is usually faulty. One may miss enzymes or wrongly annotate existing ones. The models used in this study have been automatically generated from a database constructed from information downloaded from the KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) , and since the beginning of this study the databases have been updated and most models have to be changed as well. The ''knockedout'' models used for the sensibility parameter analysis simulate such imperfect annotations: one might consider the situation with n K = 5 as the model constructed from a well-annotated genome, while the case with n K = 100 is the model resulting from a very poor annotation. One can see that when only a few enzymes might be missing from the annotation, the error in the parameter can be expected to be less than 1%, except for the case of the minimalistic genomes like the parasitic mge, that has an error more than five times bigger than the other organisms. This error increases as the number of knock-outs increase, but it keeps below 5% even for 100 knockouts (or missing enzymes), except again in the case of the mge, but even for the mge it is below 10%. This shows that the methodology is robust and that one works here with an uncertainty of less than 5% in most of the cases.",
