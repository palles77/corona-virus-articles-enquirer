In cases where two or more inventors submit patent applications claiming the same invention, an interference may be declared. Interference is the process by which the US Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO; Washington, DC, USA) determines which of the applicants was the first to invent and diligently reduce the invention to practice. More than half of these are resolved in favor of the inventor who was the first-to-file, raising questions about whether this unique system is worth retaining 1 . Interferences are relatively rare. For the period 1998-2002, an average of four interferences were declared for every 10,000 patent applications filed.",

Patents have been issued for genes in which mutations are associated with these disorders (except for chronic myelogenous leukemia). There are several patents on one gene in cystic fibrosis, and various patents on multiple genes implicated in colon cancers and in spinal muscular atrophy. Given the rarity of interferences, we were surprised to find in this small sample that patents on the genes in two of these cases (cystic fibrosis and factor V Leiden) had been involved in interferences.",

Less well known are the close competitions for discovery of genes for cystic fibrosis and familial breast and ovarian cancers, both of which involved numerous groups. In the latter case, in the mid-1990s, multiple patents on closely related discoveries were issued to Oncormed (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and Myriad Genetics (Salt Lake City, UT, USA) on BRCA1 (ref. 7) . Myriad and their collaborators at the Universities of Utah (Salt Lake City) and Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA, USA) similarly raced against the Institute of Cancer Research (Sutton, UK) and Duke University (Durham, NC, USA) on BRCA2, with US patents being issued to both and potentially overlapping patents pending in Europe. More recently, the discovery by two different research groups in 2001 of the gene associated with rare familial dysautonomia also may well result in an interference, because each group filed a patent application on the gene 8, 9 .",

First, without taking any credit away from the scientists so engaged, gene discovery has become ordinary. Many share necessary intellectual know-how, and success is predicated upon the ability and luck in identifying, soliciting and studying the 'right' families and groups. Second, as in other scientific fields, these discoveries build upon knowledge contributed by others, reflecting the codependent, but competitive, environment of science 10 . Molecular biology is data intensive, requiring the development of technologies (e.g., faster sequencers and gene chips) and sharing of large databases. The field is relatively young, and the rate of discovery may still be increasing. Given the large body of expertise in molecular biology and the large volume of information now available, there may be a flood of downstream discoveries and developments resulting from the sequencing of the human genome and a concomitant increase in competition and the volume of interferences in the near future.",

But the biotech industry is strongly dependent upon patents, and the high costs of resolving interferences are clearly seen as justified. In the two cases we studied, there were three nonprofit research institutions and one firm involved, and two of the nonprofit institutions licensed the patent applications to firms that bore the costs of the interferences. This is consistent with an earlier survey of licensing and technology transfer executives in which we found that nonprofit research institutions often seek at a minimum to cover the costs of patent prosecution in their licensing of gene sequence patents 11 .
