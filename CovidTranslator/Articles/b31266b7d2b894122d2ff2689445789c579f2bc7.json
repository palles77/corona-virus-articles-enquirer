Previous phylogenetic analyses based on sequence alignments show that SARS-CoVs form a new group distantly related to the other three groups of previously characterized coronaviruses. In this paper, a geometric approach based on the Z-curve representation of the whole genome sequence is proposed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses. The evolutionary distances are obtained through measuring the differences among the three-dimensional Z-curves. The Z-curve is approximately described by its geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors, which indicate the center position and the trend of the Z-curve, respectively. Although some information is lost due to the approximate description of the Z-curve, the phylogenetic tree constructed based on these parameters is consistent with those of previous analyses. The present method has the merits of simplicity and intuitiveness, but it is still in its premature stage. Because the phylogenetic relationships are inferred from the whole genome, instead of some individual genes, the present method represents a new direction of phylogeny study in the post-genome era.",

            "text": "An intuitive method is proposed to infer the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses in this article. Historically, Cork et al. proposed a three-dimensional representation of genomic sequences, called the Wcurve (Wu et al., 1993) . Since then, the W-curve has been used to analyze genomic sequences and study the phylogeny of bacteria (Cork, 2003; Cork and Toguem, 2002) . Instead of the sequence alignment, we adopt a geometric method based on the Z-curve of the whole genome. The Z-curve is a three-dimensional space curve constituting the unique representation of a given DNA sequence in the sense that each can be reconstructed given the other Zhang, 1991, 1994) . Based on the Z-curve method, a coronavirus-specific gene-finding system ZCURVE_ CoV has been developed , and the software is especially suitable for gene recognition in SARS-CoV genomes. The system is further improved by taking the prediction of cleavage sites of viral proteinases in polyproteins into consideration (Gao et al., 2003) . Here we use the differences between the three-dimensional space curves as the foundation to derive the phylogeny of coronaviruses. The key problems are what parameters should be used to describe a curve and how to determine evolutionary distances among organisms based on a group of curves. In this paper, we use a series of parameters, such as the geometric center and the covariance matrix to reflect the center position and the distribution pattern of a curve, respectively. The result shows that SARS-CoVs form an independent group, which is consistent with previous analyses.",

Table 2 The geometric center and three eigenvectors of the Z-curve for each of the 24 coronavirus genomes a i Abbreviation (i) The parameters of the Z-curve for each genome. Based on the Z-curve, any genome can be represented by a three-dimensional space curve composed of N nodes corresponding to every base position denoted by x n , y n , z 0 n where n = 1,2, . . . , N (Figs. 1A-C). To describe its characteristics, we calculate the following parameters. The first is the geometric center of all the n nodes",

From the coordinates and the trends in Figs. 1A-C, we can see that the Z-curves of TOR2 and BJ01 are almost the same while that of BCoV is significantly different from both of them, indicating that the former two have close phylogenetic relationship, whereas the relationships between the former two and the latter are more distant.

Group I includes HCoV-229E, TGEV, and PEDV and group II contains BCoV, BCoVL, BCoVM, BCoVQ, MHV, MHV2, MHVM, MHVP, etc. All the viruses in these two groups are mammalian viruses. Group III contains only avian viruses, of which only the genome of IBV has been completely sequenced. Many researchers have analyzed the phylogenetic relationships among coronavirus genomes based on the 3C-like proteinase, polymerase, the structural proteins S, E, M, and N, respectively (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . Their results indicated that SARS-CoVs are not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronaviruses and form a distinct group (group IV) within the genus Coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . As shown in Fig. 3 , four groups of coronaviruses can be seen from the phylogram. The SARS-CoVs appear to cluster together and form a separate branch, which can be distinguished easily from other three groups of coronaviruses. IBV, belonging to group III, is situated at an independent branch, whereas the TGEV, PEDV, and HCoV-229E, which belong to group I, tend to cluster together. In another branch, the group II coronaviruses, including BCoV, BCoVL, BCoVM, BCoVQ, MHV, MHV2, MHVM, and MHVP tend to cluster together. First, group I and group II, which are all mammalian viruses, cluster together forming a bigger group. Second, this group joins group III, which contains only avian viruses, to form a much bigger group. Finally, SARS-CoVs join them and result in the phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 3 . The resulting monophyletic clusters agree perfectly with the established taxonomic groups. To validate the current method, a set of random sequences were used as a control. We generated 100 random sequences meeting the requirements in the method. Each time a phylogenetic analysis was done using 25 sequences including one random sequence and the 24 genomes. Consequently, 100 phylogenetic trees were obtained. Ninety-eight out of the 100 trees showed that the random sequence formed a distinct group without disturbing the other four groups. Only two of the random sequences disturbed the four groups, suggesting that the current method is solid with respect to the situation that a random sequence is added.",

As can be seen from Fig. 3 , the distance between the SARS-CoVs and all the others is the greatest. We supposed that the precursor of SARS-CoV may have existed in some hosts and developed separately for many years. Grigoriev found that the mutational patterns in SARS-CoV genome were strikingly different from the other coronaviruses in terms of mutation rates (Grigoriev, 2004) . Phylogenetic analysis based on codon usage pattern suggested that SARS-CoV was diverged far from all the three known groups of coronavirus (Gu et al., 2004) . The overall level of similarity between SARS-CoVs and the other coronaviruses is low . We suppose that this is due to different evolution paths. The isolation of SARS-CoV-like virus in Himalayan palm civets indicates a route of interspecies transmission. We hypothesize that some events such as the nucleotide deletion or mutation in some important genes of the precursor may have resulted in the change of host range.",

Now phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments is well developed. Sequence alignments are always based on some special genes or some conserved fragments (Saitou, 1996) . Such analysis can be done at both the amino acid level and the nucleotide level. To overcome the biases caused by individual genes or genome segments, it is valuable to develop methods of molecular phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequences. Being different from the sequence alignment method, the current method is a geometric approach which is based on measuring the differences of Z-curves of whole genomes, including coding and non-coding sequences. There is no need to search for similar sequences. Probably, the most remarkable advantages of the present method is its simplicity and intuitiveness. The result shows that four groups exist in the genus Coronavirus. Note that group I (HCoV-229E, TGEV, and PEDV) and group II (BCoVM, BCoVL, BCoVQ, BCoV, MHVM, MHV2, MHVP, and MHV) cluster together forming a bigger group firstly. Second, this group joins group III (IBV) to form a much bigger group. Finally, SARS-CoVs join them and result in the phylogenetic tree shown here. Also note that the resulting monophyletic clusters agree perfectly with the established taxonomic groups.",

Phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments is usually done on the most conservative part of a gene. These fragments are usually coding sequences, especially the sequences coding for catalytic sites or the core of proteins, because they tend to be more evolutionarily conserved. It was said by a virologist that people could not simply assume that a virus can be represented by its polymerase (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTV/). A virus must be viewed as a whole. Non-coding sequences also play an important role in the virus, so do the less conserved genes. In addition, analyses based on different genes may lead to different results. Consequently, by using complete genomes one can avoid choosing which genes to be aligned. Therefore methods that are based on the whole genome are likely to be more objective. Recently, a kstring composition approach was proposed to analyze prokaryote phylogeny based on the whole proteome and satisfactory results were obtained (Qi et al., 2004) ; however, such analysis must rely on the annotation information. In contrast, the complete genome sequence is the only input of the current method; neither the annotation information, nor any adjustable parameters are needed. It is noteworthy that the current method is performed automatically without any human intervention.",

The Z-curve contains all the information that the corresponding DNA sequence carries. Many characteristics of a genome with biological meaning can be observed from the corresponding Z-curve, such as the replication origins and genomic islands for some bacterial and archaeal genomes . We can inspect a genome in an intuitive way regardless of the gene content and gene order, even though the sequences are of different lengths. If the Zcurves of two species show similar pattern even though the genomes have different lengths, one may infer that they are evolutionarily close organisms, and vice versa. In this paper, we use the geometric center and the eigenvectors to describe the pattern approximately. Although this is only a rough approximation, it represents just an attempt to apply the Z-curve method to the phylogenetic analysis and the results obtained agree well with previous analyses.",

Phylogenetics analysis is based on the differences among the three-dimensional Z-curves. In this paper, the 24 genomes under study all belong to the same genus Coro-navirus. Additionally, the differences of length among genomes are not very large. If the genomes under study have much farther phylogenetic relationships, and the differences in length are considerably large, the present method may not work. Consequently, cautions must be taken when using the present method to study the phylogeny of organisms with far evolutionary distances. In addition, unlike the estimation based on comparison of orthologous genes, the Z-curve approach is also sensitive to genome rearrangements: a single large-scale inversion can change the form of Z-curve drastically. Therefore, the method presented here is considerably limited in the cases of genome rearrangements. In addition, as mentioned above, the three-dimensional Z-curve is approximately depicted by a few parameters, such as the geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors. Consequently, information contained in the Zcurve is lost considerably in so doing. It is reasonable to suppose that the more information is extracted from the Z-curve, the more accurate result can be gained. Therefore, the current method can be improved if new and more effective algorithms are proposed to extract information contained in the Z-curves. In summary, although the present method has some advantages, it is still in its premature stage. The method may not be applied to some general cases, therefore the applications of it are considerably limited at present.",
