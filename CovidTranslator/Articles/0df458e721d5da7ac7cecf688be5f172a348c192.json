Of the more than 80 million people who travel from industrialized to developing nations, between 20% and 70% report some illness associated with their travel. [2] [3] [4] A small proportion, between 5% and 19%, of those who develop a travel-associated illness seek medical attention either during or immediately after travel.

GeoSentinel sites are located on 6 continents and collect clinician-based surveillance data on travel-associated disease from more than 30 locations. TropNet Europe has 68 member sites, which contribute surveillance data for travel-associated illness in Europe. A case definition for travel-associated illness is a patient has who crossed an international border within the past 10 years and presents for a presumed travel-related illness. 5 This definition encompasses a very broad set of clinical conditions, including dermatologic disease, injury, tuberculosis, and chronic diarrhea.

Most patients in this group were middle-aged men, and most people in the study group had traveled for tourism, on business, or to visit friends and relatives. These individuals (those visiting friends and relatives) constitute a high-risk group because they are much less likely than tourist travelers to receive prophylaxis, and tend to use fewer preventive measures. Consequently they are almost 9 times more likely than other groups to require inpatient treatment when they return with febrile complications of travel. 9 Most individuals with fever after travel present within 1 to 3 weeks after returning home. These presentations, considered acute and subacute, are within the direct purview of the emergency medicine specialist. Among those in whom a definitive diagnosis is reached the majority have malaria, acute diarrheal disease, acute respiratory tract infections, or dengue fever (Fig. 1) . 8 More than 35% of patients presenting with a febrile syndrome after travel do not receive a definitive diagnosis, even in the hands of trained experts, which highlights the importance of a structured diagnostic approach. One of the key principles in approaching the presentation of fever in the returning traveler is a thorough understanding of epidemiology as it applies to the individual's circumstances. Most patients present with undifferentiated and nonlocalizing systemic febrile syndromes, so the clinical decision-making process and the diagnostic algorithm should reflect the likelihood of acquiring a specific disease based on regional morbidity, host-pathogen interaction, and the clinical assessment. Accordingly, the following 3 key areas are discussed in the next section of this review:",

Several diagnoses, and their empiric therapies, can be guided by an understanding of regional risk. 10 GeoSentinel data, collected from 17,353 patients who traveled to 230 countries between June 1996 and August 2004, demonstrate significant regional differences in proportionate morbidity for 16 of 21 broad syndromic categories, including systemic febrile syndrome. 5 In the context of systemic febrile illness, destination-specific variations in proportionate morbidity are stark (Fig. 2 dengue fever has a fairly broad global distribution. EuroTravelNet data from 17,228 patients show similar patterns of distribution (Fig. 3) . 11 Data from 1842 febrile returned travelers in Belgium demonstrated that 91% of all imported malaria cases were from sub-Saharan Africa, all cases of enteric fever were from Asia, and dengue was nearly evenly split between Asia and the Americas. 12 Data from Australia found 6-fold higher rates of malaria in itineraries that included Africa, 13-fold increases in dengue for itineraries that included Asia, and high rates of malaria among visitors to Oceania. 13, 14 Although a thorough understanding of destination-specific proportionate morbidity rates is important, other considerations must be incorporated into the assessment process. Generally speaking, geographic trends correlate with the diagnosis in roughly one-third of febrile patients returning from developing nations; the other two-thirds have undifferentiated fever and other diagnoses.",

            "text": "The importance of obtaining a detailed travel history cannot be overstated in the evaluation of the febrile traveler. Determination of possible infectious exposures and their associated incubation periods can be particularly helpful in ruling out causes of fever. For example, a fever that began more than 3 weeks after a traveler returned home is very unlikely to be caused by dengue, rickettsial disease, or viral hemorrhagic fever; it is much more likely to be caused by malaria (particularly the forms caused by Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium ovale) if the infection was acquired abroad. Careful attention to the exposure history, immunization status, and use of malarial chemoprophylaxis can be very helpful in establishing a diagnosis. In a series of 2071 fever episodes from 1962 patients in Europe, the majority (78%) presented within 1 month after return from travel. 15 GeoSentinel data for 6957 patients presenting with fever found that after malaria, the most common specific infections causing systemic febrile illness were dengue, enteric fever, and rickettsioses, all of which have short to medium incubation periods (<21 days). 8 Incubation periods for common infectious agents are presented in Table 2 . Whereas most infections in travelers have incubation periods of less than 21 days, several can manifest more than 30 days after return (eg, malaria, tuberculosis, hepatitis, filariasis). Furthermore, patients might spend several weeks to months overseas and then present within a short time after returning home with infections that were acquired months earlier. The most common infection presenting more than 30 days after exposure is P vivax malaria (25% of patients with this infection in the United States present after 30 days). 16 The emergency physician who is evaluating a traveler with a febrile illness should inquire about the following topics:",

Because a large proportion of diagnoses will remain in the scope of \"cosmopolitan infections,\" a practical approach to the workup of patients with imported disease is warranted. Initial assessment should include evaluation for common local causes of fever. Given that no source will be identified in one-third of patients and that a cosmopolitan cause will be identified also in about one-third of patients, it is the remaining third that is the focus of the imported disease workup.

Of these, P falciparum poses the highest risk for severe disease and complications while P vivax constitutes the bulk of chronic and recrudescent disease. Transmission occurs through the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito, with multiple species responsible for transmission. Life cycles involve both hepatic and hematologic stages; the intraerythrocytic stages account for the clinical spectrum of disease. The minimum incubation period for P falciparum is 6 days, with most clinical symptoms developing between 9 and 14 days after exposure (median 12) days. 34 Incubation periods for P vivax and P ovale are significantly longer, ranging from 8 days to several months. The majority of cases of P vivax infection present within 2 months after exposure; however, cases of P vivax and P ovale have presented several years after exposure, which likely constitutes disease recrudescence.",

Thick peripheral blood films have an advantage of allowing more red blood cells to be examined per high-powered field, and therefore have increased sensitivity in comparison with thin films, which are used primarily for parasite speciation. The sensitivity of individual thick smears is variable, and depends on smear preparation and the technical experience of laboratory personnel. In recent years, malarial rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been introduced into clinical practice for antigen detection. Similar to other point-of-care tests, RDTs are fairly simple to use and numerous brands are available worldwide. In the United States, only one RDT has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, namely the BinaxNOW Malaria Test kit, which is 97% sensitive for all species of malaria and 100% sensitive for P falciparum. 37 Many laboratories find this test to be superior to microscopic diagnosis, particularly when smears are performed infrequently. Other rarely used diagnostic strategies include the quantitative buffy coat technique, which allows centrifugation and separation of parasitized from unparasitized cells to facilitate parasite detection, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect parasite DNA. Regardless of the diagnostic strategy used, it is important that diagnosis should never supersede empiric treatment when severe P falciparum infection is suspected.",

As it stands, the CDC recommends parenteral quinidine for severe malaria. Quinidine remains available and effective, and should be considered first-line until parenteral artemisinin therapy is made available. 41 Therapy with quinidine should be combined with doxycycline or clindamycin, and a 7-day course should be completed. For cases of uncomplicated malaria, 3 options exist in the United States. Most patients with uncomplicated disease should receive either atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone), artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) or oral quinidine plus doxycycline. The CDC maintains a 24-hour hotline and updated online treatment guidelines, which should be referenced when treating patients with imported malaria.

The more severe syndromes were thought to be rare in returning travelers, as they are associated with repeated infection; however, up to 16% of cases reported to the CDC between 2006 and 2008 were classified as DHF/DSS. 47 Progression to the more serious spectrum of DHF/DSS is marked by coagulopathy and increased vascular permeability. 48 Hemorrhagic manifestations include easy bruising, bleeding at venipuncture sites, and a positive tourniquet test. On the third to seventh day of illness, often as the fever subsides, changes in vascular permeability may lead to edema, effusions, and the circulatory collapse that marks DSS. Risk Fever in the Returning Traveler factors for developing more severe disease are poorly understood; however, individuals with a history of dengue infection are more likely to develop DHF/DSS (OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.4-17.7). 49 Low platelet counts correlate with increased bleeding (OR 3.1, 95% CI 0.95-10.7), and an elevated aminotransferase concentration is associated with progression to DHF (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2-10.0). 50 The initial diagnosis of dengue fever is clinical, typified by fever and constitutional symptoms in individuals returning from endemic areas. Laboratory features suggestive of dengue infection include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated levels of liver enzymes. DHF (mortality rate 10%-20%) is defined as the triad of: Thrombocytopenia (<100,000 platelets) Hemorrhagic manifestations Objective evidence of plasma leakage (hematocrit increase >20%, hypoproteinemia, or evidence of effusions) DSS (with a mortality rate of up to 40%) is characterized by hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90%) or a narrow pulse pressure (<20 mm Hg). Patients with DHF/ DSS warrant admission to a high level of care, as profound hemodynamic shock may rapidly ensue. Leukopenia (<5000 cells/mL) coupled with thrombocytopenia also warrants admission of patients with suspected dengue infection. Serologic diagnosis relies on acute and convalescent serum titers, with convalescent samples drawn 3 weeks after infection.

When these disseminate to cause systemic illness, they are collectively called enteric fever. Infection typically occurs via an oral-fecal route and comes from contaminated food and water, most commonly where standards of personal and environmental hygiene are low. In 2000, enteric fever affected 21.6 million people and claimed 216,500 lives. 52 The burden of disease is highest in south central Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa (>100 cases/ 100,000 people per year), and moderately high in the rest of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Oceania (10-100 cases/100,000 people per year). 53 Enteric fever accounts for 2.9% of diagnosed causes of fever in returned travelers, and 14.1% among travelers returning from the Indian subcontinent. 5 Two typhoid vaccines are available: the single-dose Vi vaccine (55%-72% effective) and the 3-dose Ty21a vaccine (33%-96% effective). 53 Typhoid fever has an incubation period of 7 to 18 days. Affected individuals invariably present with fever. The bacteria initially invade the intestinal mucosa and then pass from the lymphatics to the bloodstream, where they replicate and cause systemic illness. The fever often starts as low grade and then proceeds \"stepwise\" to become persistent and high grade by the second week. Headache (typically dull and frontal), abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea, and cough are common symptoms, and can be confused with malaria. Classically, \"rose spots\" (2-3-mm blanching, pinkred macules) appear early in the course of the disease, but they appear only briefly and are often difficult to detect except in light-skinned persons. 17 The Faget sign (relative bradycardia during high fever) has been described in association with typhoid fever, but is rarely seen in clinical practice.",
