A Granger causality test is performed following the cointegration approach to reveal the direction of causality between economic growth and tourism expansion. Test results indicate a long-run equilibrium relationship and further a bi-directional causality between the two factors. In other words, in Taiwan, tourism and economic development reinforce each other. A discussion follows and managerial implications are identified based on the empirical findings. r",

Global tourism receipts were 475.8 billion in US dollars (US$) for 2000 and 462 billion US$ for 2001. Tourist spending, as an alternative form of exports, can contribute to the balance of payments through foreign exchange earnings and proceeds generated from tourism expansion and can represent a significant income source for a national economy (Balaguer & Cantavella-Jorda, 2002) . Foreign exchange earnings from tourism can also be used to import capital goods to produce goods and services, which in turn leads to economic growth (McKinnon, 1964) . Other economic benefits derived from tourism activity include tax revenues, employments and addi-tional sources of income (Archer, 1995; Belisle & Hoy, 1980; Davis, Allen, & Consenza, 1988; Durbarry, 2002; Khan, Seng, & Cheong, 1990; Uysal & Gitelson, 1994; West, 1993) . It is generally assumed that tourism expansion should have a positive contribution to economic growth.",

After conducting a standard Granger (1969) causality test, the authors further found that tourism affected Spain's economic growth in one direction, thereby supporting the tourism-led growth hypothesis. Although the authors mentioned that the tourism-led growth hypothesis is not specific to developing countries, it was not clearly stated that the theory could be applicable to all countries. Dritsakis (2004) examined the impact of tourism on the long-run economic growth of Greece using a similar method. One cointegrated vector was found among GDP, real effective exchange rate and international tourism earnings from 1960 to 2000. Granger causality tests based on Error Correction Models indicated that there is a strong Granger causal relationship between international tourism earnings and economic growth, a strong causal relationship between real exchange rate and economic growth and simply causal relationships between economic growth and international tourism earnings and between real exchange rate and international tourism earnings. In sum, his study supports both tourism-led economic development and economic-driven tourism growth.",

After Balaguer and Cantavella-Jorda's (2002) work, Oh (2005) counter-argued that the existence of the tourism-led growth hypothesis in Spain may be attributed to the fact that Spain is one of the world's top recipients of international tourist revenues. Tourism earnings in Spain comprise approximately 5.9 percent of its GDP (World Tourism Organization, 2000) . The author used South Korea as a destination country for comparison. Although South Korea and Spain are both developing countries, the tourism industry in South Korea is not as strong as Spain. For example, value-added revenue derived from tourismrelated activities accounts for 3.5 percent of South Korea's GDP (Bank of Korea, 2002) . In his study, the cointegration analysis indicated no long-run link between tourism receipts and economic growth in South Korea over the period from 1975 to 2001. He further found an economic-driven tourism growth instead of a tourism-led economic growth, thereby implying that in South Korea, economic growth led tourism expansion rather than tourism expansion causing economic growth.",

Empirical studies have reported the mixed results regarding a causal relationship between exports growth and economic expansion. For example, Shan and Sun (1998) showed a reciprocal relationship between international trade (exports growth) and economic development in China, whereas Marin (1992) demonstrated a unidirectional influence of exports growth on economic expansion in industrialized and developed countries such as Japan, UK, US, and Germany.

The monthly series of TOUR were available from January 1971 to July 2003. Because GDP data were quarterly based, the quarterly TOUR was calculated using the monthly TOUR. To match the time period with TOUR, the quarterly GDP was chosen from the first quarter of 1971 to the second quarter of 2003. The annual series of TOUR were available from 1956 to 2002. For the same reason, the annual GDP data were selected beginning from 1956 to 2002. Then, TOUR and GDP data were transformed by the use of natural logarithms (LTOUR and LGDP) to ease interpretation of coefficients. Coefficients in the log function indicate a percentage change in a dependent variable given a percentage change in an independent variable. The time trends of seasonally unadjusted data of LGDP and LTOUR are plotted in Fig. 1 . seasonal pattern or structural change in LGDP and LTOUR. 3 The empirical examination of the financial or macroeconomic data based on various time horizons can provide different results because information about a certain period is spread over many previous time periods and not all information about the future becomes publicly known over a short period of time (Fama & French, 1987; Fama, 1990; Timmermann, 1994) . Therefore, quarterly and yearly data using different time periods were chosen to ensure consistent empirical evidences regarding a relationship between tourism expansion and economic growth in Taiwan",

Results of both ADF and PP tests for stationarity are reported in Table 2 .

Most foreign firms were not allowed in the Korean market until South Korea became wide open in the mid 1990s after joining the WTO (World Trade Organization).

No strict travel regulations have ever existed in Taiwan. The reason for this may be explained by one distinctive difference in the economic system between the two nations. Small and medium-sized companies play a key role in Taiwan whereas large conglomerates lead South Korea (Feenstra, Yang, & Hamilton, 1999) . In South Korea, it is perhaps sufficient for a few selected people such as key managers in the trading division of large corporations to have a privilege to travel abroad. However, in Taiwan, many small independent entrepreneurs may have to make international business trips. If strict travel rules are given to these ordinary people who own such companies, their businesses will be hampered and further national economic growth will be influenced negatively.

Major economic benefits derived from tourism activity include foreign exchange earnings, employments, and income (Archer, 1995; Belisle & Hoy, 1980; Davis et al., 1988; Durbarry, 2002; Khan et al., 1990; Mill & Morrison, 2002; Uysal & Gitelson, 1994; West, 1993 ). The results of previous studies seem to be based on the assumption that tourism activity will affect the local or national economy positively. Despite the belief in tourism-led economic development, not many studies have empirically investigated a causal relationship between tourism and economic growth. Oh (2005) argued that it is necessary to investigate the hypothesis in numerous destination countries for the purpose of generalization. This study was conducted to contribute to the body of literature in respect to Taiwan.",

The Spanish data showed that tourism growth caused economic development in one direction (Balaguer & Cantavella-Jorda, 2002) ; Greece had a bi-directional causality between international tourism earnings and economic development (Dritsakis, 2004) ; and the South Korean data revealed a one-way relationship from economic growth to tourism expansion (Oh, 2005) .",

In addition to these factors, the degree of dependence on tourism, tourism destination life cycle, and the level of economic development may be considered as some other determinants. In future studies, tourism researchers may want to compare multiple countries using the above variables as intervening factors between economic development and tourism activity and draw a concrete conclusion as to tourism-led economic growth theory.",
