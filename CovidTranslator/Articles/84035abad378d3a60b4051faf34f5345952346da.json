The overall incidence varies from 30 to 50% and non-infectious causes occur in one-third to one-half of these. We reviewed pulmonary complications in 369 consecutive patients who received a partially T-celldepleted myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic SCT at our institution between 1993 and 2003. All patients were treated uniformly with cyclophosphamide followed by total body irradiation. Control subjects were matched on sex, underlying diagnosis, age, type of transplantation and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-serostatus. Sixty-one patients (16.5%) developed pulmonary complications. Twentyone patients (5.7%) developed infectious pneumonia. Forty patients developed non-infectious complications which were further subclassified as bronchiolitis obliterans (3.5%), bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (0.5%), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (0.8%), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (5.5%) or mixed etiology (0.5%). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) Xgrade II was significantly more common in pulmonary patients than in the controls (36/61 versus 22/61 patients, P \u00bc 0.02). There was no significant difference in the incidence of chronic GVHD (P \u00bc 0.09). CMV reactivation was significantly more frequent in patients with lung injury (P \u00bc 0.02). Median survival was 41 weeks for the pulmonary patients and 350 weeks for the controls (P \u00bc 0.001). Altogether, the incidence of pulmonary complications is low after T-cell-depleted SCT and is associated with acute GVHD and CMV reactivation.",

Whereas infectious diseases of the lung predominated in previous years, the increased use of prophylactic antibiotics has shifted the spectrum towards non-infectious causes. Traditionally, pulmonary toxicities were observed to range from 30 to 50%, 1-3 but more recent studies report a diverse and generally lower incidence. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Unfortunately, these trials did not apply a uniform definition of non-infectious pulmonary complications. The best-characterized early onset lung injury after SCT is diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), whereas bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) and bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP) occur later in the post transplant period. The most common complication is the idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), which is defined as evidence of widespread alveolar injury in the absence of lower respiratory tract infection 15 and may develop in the early but more commonly in a later setting. Additional, less frequently encountered forms of pulmonary toxicity are the periengraftment respiratory distress syndrome and delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome.",

Epithelial cell apoptosis, the classical GVHD histopathology finding, is not a consistent finding in IPS. 34, 35 However, as Cooke et al. 36 pointed out, epithelial cell apoptosis is not a requirement of GVHD pathology, and lung biopsies may be difficult to interpret because of nonspecific changes occurring, for example, during mechanical ventilation and suboptimal biopsy specimens owing to the risks associated with the procedure.",

In addition, in an allogeneic study using a low T-cell dose (0.2-1.0 \u00c2 10 5 /kg), 6.4% of patients died of IPS, while none of them developed significant GVHD. 13 Yet novel insights come from the growing experience with non-myeloablative SCT. Recently, it was shown in a group of 53 patients that the rate of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity was low after non-myeloablative conditioning without irradiation: infectious pneumonia occurred in nine patients, two patients developed IPS and no cases of DAH or BO were encountered. 10 The overall incidences of acute GVHD grade I/II, grade III/IV and extensive chronic GVHD were 19, 19 and 11%, respectively. Another report demonstrated that reduced-intensity conditioning decreased the incidence of BO, whereas chronic GVHD was not a risk factor. 38 Moreover, nonmyeloablative patients experienced a significantly lower rate of lung function decline after SCT than myeloablative patients. 39 Both the intensity of the conditioning regimen (conventional versus non-myeloablative) and the occurrence of severe acute GVHD (grades III-IV) were prognostic for the development of IPS in a multiple regression analysis. 7 In our large cohort, patients with pulmonary complications and controls were comparable with respect to well-known risk factors for lung injury, and acute GVHD Xgrade II was significantly related with pulmonary toxicity. There was no difference in the incidence of acute GVHD between patients with infectious and those with non-infectious pulmonary complications. We could not identify viral respiratory tract infections as a risk factor for progression to lung injury. Interestingly, we noted an association between pulmonary complications and CMV reactivation, which is not among previously reported risk factors. Therefore, the role of CMV reactivation and the effect of prophylaxis or pre-emptive therapy on the development of pulmonary complications deserve further evaluation.",
