In the present study, we investigated the stability of chicken yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) specific to TGEV by measuring the remaining activity by ELISA. The results showed that the IgY was stable between pH 4 and pH 11. In the incubation with pepsin at pH 4 and pH 6, about 90% and 100% of the IgY activity remained, respectively. IgY activity could remain approximately 80% at 60\u00b0C for 30 min, suggesting that pasteurization can be applied to sterilizing the product. The stability of IgY at 25\u00b0C and freezing-thawing treatment indicated that the IgY was easy to be conserved. These results highlight the attractive potential application of IgY as the antibodies of oral administration for treatment of TGEV infections.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious viral disease of swine characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. The causative agent has been demonstrated to be porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) . For piglets at the age of younger than two weeks, nearly 100% of them die when exposed to virulent TGEV (Pensaert, 1984; Saif and Wesley, 1999) . TGE is of considerable economic importance to large swine-breeding units. Since swine are born without immunoglobulin, the presence of TGEV-specific antibodies in the colostrum and milk of the sows is critical for the survival of the piglets (Tuboly and Nagy, 2001) . This suggests that oral administration of specific antibodies is effective in preventing intestinal infection. However, oral administration of antibodies is prohibitively expensive when large amounts of antibodies are required (Shin et al., 2002) . Therefore, it is important to search for effective methods as alternatives to maternal antibody for treatment of TGEV infections.",

In the previous study, we produced IgY against TGEV and investigated its immunoprophylactic effect in neonatal pigs (Zuo et al., 2008) . Oral administration of the IgY antibodies has been demonstrated to reduce piglets mortality dramatically. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of IgY as an alternative method against TGEV in piglets by investigating its stability.",

Fig. 4 Pepsin stability of IgY Note: IgY was treated with pepsin at pH 2, 4, and 6 for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h. Remaining activities after the treatments were measured using ELISA and were expressed as a percentage of the initial activity. Fig. 5 Trypsin stability of IgY Note: IgY was treated with trypsin at pH 7.5 for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h. Remaining activities after the treatments were measured using ELISA and were expressed as a percentage of the initial activity. mammals serum was significantly affected by freezing and thawing (Na et al., 1998) . The result achieved in this test suggested the particular character of IgY.",

The results showed that the IgY was stable between pH 4 and pH 11. When we tested the stability toward pepsin and trypsin, it was demonstrated that the IgY stay active when incubated with pepsin at pH 4 and pH 6 and showed a broad stability to trypsin. These results indicated that IgY could increase in its resistant to the gastric acid of piglets and the digestion of pepsin and trypsin, and it could be used as the antibodies for oral administration. IgY activity could be remained approximately 80% at 60\u00b0C for 30 min, suggesting that pasteurization can be applied to sterilize the product. The stability of IgY at 25\u00baC and freezing-thawing treatment indicated that the IgY was easy to be conserved. All these encouraging results together with its higher productivity and effectiveness would make the IgY be a novel approach to the management of TGEV infection in piglets.",
