It is possible that a staff member was ill with HRV species C the week prior to patient care and was shedding virus after the symptoms resolved. Adults with symptomatic HRV can shed virus for at least a week after infection, but it can persist up to 2-3 weeks in some adults. 8 Another possibility of transmission could have occurred from the young family member of patient 2. The sibling could have either had an asymptomatic infection or the family neglected to tell the staff that the child was feeling ill. Children <4 years old have had asymptomatic rates of infection range from 12%-32%. 9,10 Because patient 1 was in an isolette, this is a less likely scenario. Alternatively, HRV species C may have been spread through inanimate surfaces. HRV is able to survive for hours to days on environmental surfaces. 11 However, there are very few items that are shared between 2 neonates in the NICU.",

Both patients exhibited signs and symptoms within a day of each other and tested positive on the same day, making it most likely that they were exposed by a single source. Exposure by a symptomatic or asymptomatic family member is less likely because family members of infants did not directly interact with the other infant. An inanimate object was also unlikely because the infants were not mobile, and no other infants in the NICU were found to have HRV species C at that time.",
