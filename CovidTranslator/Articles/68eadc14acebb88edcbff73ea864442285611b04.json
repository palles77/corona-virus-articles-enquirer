Their evolution is related to human evolution and vice versa , resulting in an equilibrium in which both are able to coexist, sometimes without consequences for human health. However, the crossing over of the species barrier by some pathogens can have devastating consequences in terms of infections, public health and mortality. Several factors have highly impacted the spread of viral zoonoses throughout the world. Increasing globalization, increased mobility, changes in demography, environmental determinants such as ecologic and climatologic infl uences, and intense farming have increased the potential for transmission of pathogenic viruses between animals and humans (Kuiken et al ., 2005 ; Osterhaus, 2001 ) . Human and livestock populations have increased globally, causing closer contact between animals and humans. The human impact of changes in ecology and climate, together with faster transportation between countries and regions (faster than the incubation period of most of the infectious diseases), have accelerated the emergence or re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens. 'Emergence' means either the appearance of a newly evolved or a newly recognized pathogen, or the appearance of a known existing pathogen in a geographic area where it has never been found before. 'Re-emergence' is used to refer to pathogens whose presence is already recognized in a given area but which have increased in incidence (locally or globally, as for pandemics) or for pathogens which have seen their potential to cause severe infections in humans increase due to a shift in their ecology allowing, for example, the crossing of barriers from wildlife to domestic animals (as in the case of avian infl uenza) (Cutler et al ., 2010 ) .",

Military manoeuvres have always been a source of epidemics since soldiers can be brought into new environments with different infectious zoonosis (Haggett, 1994 ) .

People started exploring by sea and looking to discover new worlds. Columbus not only discovered the New World; he and other explorers also played a signifi cant role in the emergence of infectious diseases. By the time the ships arrived at the New World, diseases such as measles, tuberculosis and infl uenza were widespread throughout Europe. Explorers from infected urban areas brought diseases to the Americas, where they killed thousands of people who had mostly evolved from a very small gene pool and had no immunity to the infectious agents. So when the explorers arrived several epidemics occurred, the fi rst ones always being the most severe. For instance, the population of central Mexico fell by an estimated one-third in the decade following contact with Europeans and one-third to half of the local population of Santo Domingo died following smallpox infection which then spread to other areas in the Caribbean and the Americas. The explorers also paid a high price for discovering the New World, as they became infected with tropical diseases that were not indigenous in Europe.",

These two factors have also contributed to the emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases and to the spread of zoonotic diseases that would otherwise have been confi ned to local areas. Advances in technology have speeded up transportation, increasing the global mobility of people, and allowing faster trade in products and services that can be obtained rapidly from anywhere in the world. Every day, around the world, more than 1.4 billion people cross international borders in aeroplanes. According to the World Tourism Organization, in 2011 a total of 980 million people crossed international borders worldwide, an increase of 4.4% compared to 2010, and it is estimated that by the year 2020 that number will increase to more than 1.5 billion (see Fig. 20 .1 ). Other means of transport carry millions of people, with cruise ships transporting 47 million passengers per year (Wilson, 2003 ) . Today it is possible to travel to virtually any part of the world in a time period that is shorter than the incubation period of most infectious disease agents. Therefore, the traveller acts as a transmitter, a sentinel and a courier of infectious diseases. Wilson ( 2003 ) states that 'the traveller can be seen as an interactive biological unit who picks up, processes, carries and drops off microbial genetic material. A traveller can introduce potential pathogens in the absence of signs and symptoms.' Thus, human travel and migration have major consequences for the spread of infectious diseases worldwide.",

Many different factors -economic, social and political -have caused the human population to start migrating from rural areas to more urban ones. The number of big cities has increased, especially in developing countries where the population has risen steeply. The rapid growth of cities is often related to rapid and unplanned urbanization which can result in the deterioration of air and water quality, inadequate sanitation facilities and services, and the overuse of water resources (Moore et al ., 2003 ) . The burden of infectious disease in developing countries with rapid urbanization rates is extremely high, due to both overpopulation and pollution (Crompton and Savioli, 1993 ) . Closer contact between reservoir hosts also results from overpopulation, which then creates a potential risk of the crossing over of species (Haggett, 1994 ) . In developing countries, access to sanitation in urban areas lacking municipal water supply is still restricted, so people often use common water sources that are faecally contaminated (Moore et al ., 2003 ) . The rapid and uncontrolled growth of population in urban areas and the extension of agricultural areas to new environments precipitate the risk of the emergence or re-emergence of an infectious disease.",

Globalization is responsible for an increase in global trade. Through global trade, human pathogens, insect vectors, and their intermediate animal hosts can be disseminated throughout the world. Trade in food raw materials in the globalized world is increasing each year. Animals can be reared and fresh produce grown, and both can be shipped thousands of kilometres from place of origin to point of consumption (Tauxe, 1997 ) . Again, advances in technology have enabled mass production, mass processing and a better food distribution network, making it feasible for food grown in one location to be processed somewhere else and consumed in multiple destinations. As a consequence, unwanted micro-organisms can be transported from one place where they are endemic to another where they may adapt and cause major outbreaks of infectious diseases (Wilson, 1995 ) . Vector insects can also be transported along the distribution chain, adapt to a new environment and infect humans through direct contact or by having an amplifying animal host which then can contaminate environmental waters (see Fig. 20 .2 ).",

Several emerging or re-emerging zoonotic viral diseases fall into the second category. Despite research and diverse institutional efforts to eradicate viral diseases such as poliomyelitis and smallpox, many infectious diseases, including several caused by emerging or re-emerging zoonotic viruses, are still uncontrolled and far from being eradicated or understood. Some previously known agents have become more infectious due to alterations in disease patterns (e.g.,Oropouche virus or Chikungunya virus). Others, such as Nipah and Hendra viruses or SARS-Coronavirus, were not discovered and described until very recently, and have a high pathogenic potential (Manojkumar and Mrudula, 2006 ) . They are associated with encephalitis (Nipah virus, tick-borne encephalitis), haemorrhagic fevers (Hantavirus), fl u-like signs (avian infl uenza) and respiratory disease (SARS-Coronavirus). , 1999 ) . Infections as a result of the consumption of contaminated dairy products were fi rst identifi ed in the European part of Russia between 1947 and 1951. In these situations, whole families were being infected. This is contrary to what was observed when the transmission was from tick bites, where only single persons but not the whole family were infected. Research has proven that this form of disease was associated with the consumption of goat's milk containing infectious TBE viruses (Korenberg and Pchelkina, 1975 ; Popov and Ivanova, 1968 ) . Later reports also demonstrated the transmission of TBE virus through the consumption of non-pasteurized milk from sheep and cows (Gres \u00ed kov \u00e1 et al. , 1975 ; Leonov et al. , 1976 ) . The clinical manifestations resulting from an infection with TBE virus are well-known and a wide range of symptoms can be observed. The Far-Eastern subtype presents a monophasic progression, whereas the European is biphasic (Dumpis et al ., 1999 ; Gritsun et al ., 2003 ) . The incubation period of a TBE virus infection is 7 to 14 days. In the biphasic course, symptoms in the prodromal stage can be mistaken for 'fl u, with non-specifi c moderate fever and myalgia, accompanied by high fever and vomiting (Gritsun et al ., 2003 ) . In the European subtype, this is often succeeded by an asymptomatic period lasting 2 to 10 days. The disease can then progress to the nervous system, advancing to the second stage, which is characterized by the development of high temperatures and acute central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. Acute TBE is characterized by encephalitic symptoms in a high percentage of infected persons, ranging from 45% to 56% (Haglund and G \u00fc nther, 2003 ) . Several symptoms may be observed, including mild meningitis and severe meningoencephalomyelitis, which progress 5-10 days after the remission of the fever. The acute febrile period correlates with the presence of the viraemia. In the second stage, the virus infects the CNS, where it replicates, resulting in the infl ammation, lysis and dysfunction of the cells (Dumpis et al ., 1999 ) . The second stage of illness can range from 2 to 20 days. During convalescence, problems with concentration and memory, sleep disturbances, and headache following mental or physical stress have been reported.",

Even though AI viruses are considered specifi c to given species and rarely cross the species barrier, since 1959 AI viruses subtypes H5, H7, and H9 have managed to cause sporadic human infections (INFOSAN IFSAN, 2004 ) . H5N1 highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) was fi rst isolated from a domestic goose in Guangdong, China in 1996, followed by an outbreak in the live bird markets in Hong Kong the following year. It was during this outbreak that the fi rst human infection occurred and by the end of 1997, 18 people were hospitalized with six of the cases being fatal. Several other H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in humans have been reported since 2003,the probable cause being close contact with contaminated birds (CDC, 2006 ; WHO, 2006 ) . Surveillance data have reported the detection of H5N1 HPAI virus in imported frozen duck meat, and both on the surface of and inside contaminated eggs (Beato et al ., 2009; Harder et al ., 2009 ; Tumpey et al ., 2002 ) . However, although there is experimental evidence that the ingestion of uncooked poultry blood or meat has transmitted the H5N1 HPAI to carnivorous animals, there is no direct established link between the consumption of contaminated poultry products and human infection (CDC, 2007 ; WHO, 2005; Writ. Comm. Second WHO Consult. Clin. Aspects Hum. Infect. Avian Infl uenza A Virus, 2008) . Contaminated matrices such as water, and poultry faeces used as fertilizers or fi sh feed, have been suspected to be the source of transmission of H5N1 HPAI viruses when no direct contact with poultry or poultry products existed Kandun et al ., 2006 ) . Human-to-human transmission of AI virus is relatively low but has occurred in Thailand (2004), Vietnam (2004 ), Azerbaijan (2006 ), Indonesia (2006 ), Egypt (2007 , and Pakistan (2007), generally after one member of the family has been in direct contact with infected poultry or other infected humans (CDC, 2006 ; Ungchusak et al ., 2005 ; WHO, 2008 ) .",

It was reported that the sister of this patient had also died of a similar illness just two weeks before, suggesting an existing predisposition to this type of disease . As is observed for seasonal infl uenza virus, infection of the CNS appears to be rare (Morishima et al ., 2002 ) . The clinical pathway of an infection with H5N1 HPAI virus usually involves a rapid progression to the lower tract, at which point the patient needs to be mechanically ventilated (Beigel et al ., 2005 ; Chotpitayasunondh et al ., 2005 ; Tam, 2002 ; Tran et al ., 2004 ) . Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has also been associated with the progression to respiratory failure. Several other clinical manifestations of multi-organ failure have been diagnosed, with cardiac and renal dysfunction, pulmonary haemorrhage, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and pneumothorax (Beigel et al ., 2005 ; Chotpitayasunondh et al ., 2005 ; Gilsdorf et al ., 2006 ; Ungchusak et al ., 2005 ) .The mean time between onset and hospitalization was 4.6 days (median of 4.0 days), ranging from 0 to 22 days (WHO, 2008 ) . An increase in the case fatality rate was directly correlated to time from illness onset to hospitalization: 12% for 0 days, 47 and 55% for days 1 and 2, respectively, and over 70% for 4-6 days (WHO, 2008 ) .",

Further analyses suggest that Bat-SCoVs and SARS-CoV have been evolving independently, presumably in bat hosts, for a long time (Ren et al ., 2006 ) . In addition to masked palm civets and bats, other animal species might have been involved in the evolution and emergence of SARS-CoV. At least seven animal species can harbor SARS-CoV in certain circumstances, including raccoon dog, red fox, Chinese ferret, mink, pig, wild boar, and rice fi eld rat . In conclusion, it is likely that another outbreak of SARS-CoV or a similar Coronavirus may occur in the future.

The fi rst step in control of any disease is surveillance. The characteristics and transmission patterns of the virus, along with the understanding of vectors and animal reservoirs, and the environment and epidemiology of the disease, have to be fully considered when control and prevention measures are defi ned. A better understanding of the epidemiology of the diseases associated with wildlife as reservoirs, including the virulence of the agents and their routes of transmission, would contribute to improving eradication measures for such scourges. In addition, better sanitary conditions, including proper treatment and release of human waste, improvement in public water supplies, proper personal hygiene methods and sanitary food preparation, are of extreme importance in control measures. Improved diagnostics and prophylaxis require research deep inside the molecular biology of each virus. A clear knowledge of the migration pattern of birds and the diseases they transmit would help to prevent outbreaks of emerging viruses such as H5N1 HPAI. The emergence and re-emergence of viral zoonoses must unite the efforts of two scientifi c fi elds that are currently working separately: public health and veterinary studies. Better, highly sensitive and faster detection techniques, including molecular biology methods such as genomics and proteomics working side-by-side with more conventional methodologies, would enable identifi cation of emerging or re-emerging viruses. Rapid detection would facilitate the timely application of therapeutic/prophylactic/preventive measures. Proper vaccination campaigns can help decrease the incidence and spread of infectious diseases. Travellers should obtain information from the appropriate institutions, such as government medical advisory bodies and local health authorities, about the risks they incur, the prophylactic treatments available and the do's and don'ts while visiting a different country with a different environment and potential hazards. Medical institutions and the media should work together to disclose more knowledge on emerging or re-emerging diseases, the transmission routes, and the prophylactic measures available. Public awareness regarding the handling of wild animals in exotic markets and better food handling and cooking procedures would also help prevent outbreaks from occurring.",

Nipah virus was the aetiological agent responsible for a large outbreak in humans in Malaysia during 1998 and 1999 and for fi ve subsequent outbreaks in Bangladesh between2001  (Chua et al ., 2000Hsu et al ., 2004 ). The island fl ying fox, a fruit bat, ( Pteropushypomelanus ) is the primary reservoir for this virus where it persists in low numbers(Chua et al ., 2002 ), and it has emerged via domestic animal amplifi er hosts. Nipah virus has the ability to replicate uncontrollably in pigs, causing respiratory and/or neurological diseases leading ultimately to death(MohdNor et al ., 2000 ). The effects on humans of infection by Nipah virus can range from an asymptomatic infection to fatal encephalitis. The incubation period can vary from four to 45 days. The fi rst stage of the infection is the development of fever, headache, sore throat, myalgia, and vomiting, similar to common 'fl u. The infection can then evolve to dizziness, altered consciousness, drowsiness, and some neurological signs indicating acute encephalitis. Moreover, some infected people can also exhibit severe respiratory problems and atypical pneumonia. The most severe cases develop encephalitis and seizures that progress in 24-48 hFig. 20.2 Most common routes of transmission of infectious diseases between animals and humans. The three main subtypes of TBE virus are the European, Siberian,and Far-Eastern (Ecker et al ., 1999 ). TBE is a vector-borne infectious disease transmitted by the bite of the ticks Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes persulcatus (eastern Europe). Infections related to the consumption of infected unpasteurized milk and cheese made from such milk have also been reported (Dumpis et al .",
