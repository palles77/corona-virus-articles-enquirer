Human sera reacting in the DID test neutralized the infectivity of the bovine coronaviruses to indices of 2.5 to ~> 5. Nineteen of 40 DID-negative, heat-inactivated sera had neutralizing indices of 1 to 3.0. Human serum with neutralizing and DID antibodies produced juxtanuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence identical to that of bovine immune serum in cells infected with the bovine coronavirus. Antibodies in human and bovine sera interacted with the peplomeres of the bovine coronavirus, matting and bridging them, when present in excess, and facilitated formation of large viral aggregates when present in equivalent concentrations. Complement added to the virus-antibody complexes did not alter specifically the morphology of single, antibody-laden viral particles or viral particles in aggregates. Evidence of the transmission of coronavirus from experimentally inoculated calves to man, with ensuing gastroenteritis, was found by electron microscopic tracing of the coronavirus and its virus-antibody complexes.",

Intestinal infections of man with cornaviruses were demonstrated repeatedly by electron microscopy, but the significance of this infection as a cause of human enteric disease remains unsettled [1, 2, 16] . Sharpe and Mebus [17] detected antibodies neutralizing infectivity of an enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus in sera of human subjects. Subsequently, antigenic relationships were found by direct and indirect immunofluorescence between the human coronavirus strain 0C43, an enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus, the type 3 mouse hepatitis virus, and the 67N hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine [ 13 ] . Kaye and coworkers postulated that the occurrence of antibodies to 67N in human sera may derive from heterologous antibody response during naturally occurring 0C43 infections [9] .",

From the murine coronavirus A59 it is known that the glycoprotein E2 induces the formation of neutralizing antibodies [20] . The general experience that viral glycoproteins are strain-specific antigens could favor the assumption that the same coronavirus strain, which has a stable antigenic structure [18] , may infect either species. Accordingly, the extent of the antigenic relationship between OC43 and the bovine coronavirus has to be defined further. It is of interest that calf sera commercially available for cell culture contained antibodies having high neutralizing activity for the L9 strain [18] .
