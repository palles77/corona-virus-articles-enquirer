[6] [7] [8] [9] HRVs are phylogenetically classified into three species: HRV-A, HRV-B, and the recently discovered HRV-C. All three species have been associated with acute respiratory illness. Although inpatient studies suggest that HRV-C may be more frequently associated with serious disease, 5, 10 studies performed in outpatient settings show no clear association of HRV species with disease severity. 2, [11] [12] [13] While many HRV genotypes have been sequenced, the epidemiology and clinical significance of specific HRV genotypes are poorly characterized.",

            "text": "Of 121 samples positive for HRV/EntV by FilmArray and negative for HRV by HRV LD-PCR, 13 were EntV positive by EntV LD-PCR. Degradation of low levels of HRV RNA during storage and freeze/thaw cycles could account for discordant results in the remaining samples. We were not able to assess the role of HRV viral load in the discrepant results, since the FilmArray assay does not provide viral quantitation. It is also possible that FilmArray may have a higher sensitivity to detect HRV/EntV compared to the LD-PCR assays. While two studies have found that FilmArray was more sensitive for detection of HRV than the investigators' laboratory-developed assays, the authors of these studies did not investigate if the samples detected by FilmArray were enteroviruses. 32, 33 Another study by Renaud et al., utilizing similar methods reported in this paper, demonstrated that FilmArray had decreased sensitivity for HRV compared to HRV LD-PCR when testing nonclinical samples. 16 Our study is limited by the failure to collect samples throughout the entire year. HRV is a major pathogen in fall months and we were unable to assess the impact of HRV during this period. Studies suggest that HRV is most prevalent from fall to spring and causes more severe disease in the winter. 2, 4, 5, 34 Further, we sequenced only a subset of samples with higher viral loads. Therefore, our sequencing results do not reflect the full spectrum of strains that may be present over a year and may be biased towards strains that produce higher viral loads.",
