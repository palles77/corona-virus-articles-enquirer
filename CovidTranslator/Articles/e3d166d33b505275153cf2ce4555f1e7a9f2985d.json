            "text": "The IS911 bacterial transposable element uses \u060a1 programmed translational frameshifting to generate the protein required for its mobility: translation initiated in one gene (orfA) shifts to the \u060a1 frame and continues in a second overlapping gene (orfB), thus generating the OrfAB transposase. The A-AAA-AAG frameshift site of IS911 is flanked by two stimulatory elements, an upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence and a downstream stem-loop. We show here that, while they can act independently, these stimulators have a synergistic effect when combined. Mutagenic analyses revealed features of the complex stem-loop that make it a low-efficiency stimulator. They also revealed the dual role of the upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence as (i) a stimulator of frameshifting, by itself more potent than the stem-loop, and (ii) a mandatory determinant of initiation of OrfB protein synthesis on an AUU codon directly preceding the A6G motif. Both roles rely on transient base pairing of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence with the 3 end of 16S rRNA. Because of its effect on frameshifting, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is an important determinant of the level of transposase in IS911-containing cells, and hence of the frequency of transposition.",

While the sites utilized are intrinsically shift prone, the proportion of ribosomes that shift frames is most of the time greatly enhanced by recoding signals embedded in the mRNA; the frameshifting is programmed. Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) commonly leads to the synthesis of a product encoded by two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). In some cases, especially with \u03e91 shifts, the function is regulatory. However, in most cases, including the product of the programmed ribosomal \u03ea1 frameshifting (PRF-1) analyzed in this work, special features of the novel transframe-encoded product are what is important.",

            "text": "The richest known source of programmed \u03ea1 frameshifting sequences is the bacterial transposable insertion element (IS), especially that of the IS3 family (10, 16, 28 ; see the IS Finder database [http://www-is.biotoul.fr]). Most members of the IS3 group contain only two consecutive and partially overlapping genes (orfA and orfB) (Fig. 1) . With IS3 elements, frameshifting is utilized to synthesize a transframe product (the OrfAB protein) possessing the transposase activity required for mobility (28, 36) . An interesting example is provided by IS911. 5\u0408 adjacent to its frameshift site, IS911 has an initiation codon that permits synthesis of some OrfB products on its own ( Fig.  2A) . This initiation codon is AUU, which is only known to be used for this purpose elsewhere for bacterial initiation factor 3 (IF3) and pcnB synthesis (6, 42) and a tiny number of eukaryotic genes (20) . The 5\u0408 stimulatory upstream Shine-Dalgarno (SD)-like sequence (SD B ) for the IS911 AUU initiator also serves as one of the stimulatory recoding elements for frameshifting by ribosomes that had initiated far upstream at the orfA initiator. The SD B is 11 bases 5\u0408 from the shift site, a very similar distance to that between the internal SD sequence and the shift site for Escherichia coli dnaX frameshifting (Fig. 2B ) (23) , which is utilized to synthesize an additional DNA polymerase subunit. Earlier data provided evidence that, at this spacing, an rRNA-mRNA interaction stimulates \u03ea1 frameshifting (1, 23) , and this model is more thoroughly investigated in the present work.",

It gave an apparent frameshifting frequency of about 10% \u03ee 2% when measured by pulse-labeling.

To carry out a comparative analysis of the dnaX and IS911 cassettes, four mutants were generated for each ( Fig. 2A and B): an in-frame construct (100% reference) ( Fig. 2A and B, lane 6), a Shine-Dalgarno minus mutant (GGAG changed to CCUC) ( Fig. 2A and B, lane 3) , a stem-loop deletion ( Fig. 2A and B, lane 4), and a combination of the last two changes ( Fig.  2A and B, lane 5). Frameshifting frequencies were then assessed by protein pulse-labeling. This experiment corroborates the expected greater efficiency of the dnaX signal and provides information on the nature of the concerted action of the two stimulators. Removing both stimulators leads to a low level of recoding (1.3% and 0.6%) ( Fig. 2A Whereas the two SD sequences have similar effects, the dnaX stem-loop structure, though having a lower calculated \u232cG 37\u00b0C (standard Gibbs free energy of formation at 37\u00b0C) than its IS911 counterpart (\u03ea16.2 versus \u03ea20.2 kcal/mol), is a 3.4times-more-potent stimulator of frameshifting. In IS911, association of the SD (4.2-fold stimulation by itself) and the stemloop (2.5-fold by itself) leads to a 20-fold stimulation. This is about two times more than would be expected if they were acting according to a simple multiplicative model in which the joint effect is equal to the product of the two individual factors. In dnaX, the concerted action of the SD (4.3-fold stimulation by itself) and the stem-loop (8.5-fold stimulation by itself) results in a 45-fold stimulation of frameshifting (i.e., 1.23 times more than 4.3 multiplied by 8.5). In conclusion, with both frameshift signals, the joint effect of the two stimulators clearly departs from a simple multiplicative model. There is either moderate (1.23-fold for dnaX) or significant (2-fold for IS911) synergy.",

When the Y-shaped structure is reinforced by suppressing all mismatches in the 3 stems (Fig. 3,  m219) , there is a 3-fold increase in frameshifting. However, it remains slightly less efficient than the dnaX structure (Fig. 2B ), while requiring pairing over a longer RNA segment. In a second set, loop 2 of IS911 (AUAAU) ( Fig. 2A) was positioned above a continuous stem of various lengths, from 6 to 15 bp (Fig. 3, m223 to m226) . The shorter of these (m223; 5 G-C pairs) is already two times more efficient than the original structure. Bringing it to 9 and 12 pairs (m224 and m225; mostly G-C pairs) increases its efficiency progressively, but adding 3 more pairs does not (m226). With 12 pairs, frameshifting reaches a maximum level of nearly 80%, which is higher than the 58% produced by the dnaX signal. In a third set, either stem 2 or stem 3 was deleted, resulting in a single extended stem, with one unpaired base on each side, ending with loop 1 or loop 2 (m217 and m218). Both are better stimulators than the original design and are equivalent to the dnaX region. Finally, stem 1 was kept constant but capped by loops of various lengths (5, 14, or 32 nucleotides chosen so as not to form any significant structure by Watson-Crick pairing). The construct with the shorter loop, m220, is about 5 times more active than the wild type (51% versus 10.5%). Thus, stem 1, though having an unpaired U, is a rather strong stimulator when associated with a short loop. Increasing the loop to 14 nt reduces frameshifting moderately (m221; 38%). Extending the loop to 32 nt (i.e., close to the length of the two branches in the wild-type structure) results in a major drop in frameshifting, down to a value 3 times lower than that with the original structure (m222; 3.7%).",

Moving them closer or further downstream reduces their effectiveness (8, 22, 23) , sometimes with implications for frameshift directionality (29) . A similar analysis carried out on the IS911 signal shows that it follows the common rule (Fig. 4A) . The original spacing of 6 nt is clearly better for \u03ea1 frameshifting than either 0, 12, or 18 nt. AUU initiation also is sensitive to spacing, but in a different way. The farther the structure is, the better initiation fares; there is a 6.5-fold difference between the extremes (1.7% versus 11.1%).

With the exception of the first two (no SD sequence or 3 consecutive matches), these changes, even to a potentially better SD sequence, have only a minor, if any, effect on frameshifting and initiation. Changing the SD B to a less-efficient version, aAuGGAaa (which does not affect the amino acid sequence), reduces both frameshifting and initiation 7.1-and 6.5-fold (Fig. 5A, lanes 10 and 11, m235 versus m201) , respectively. Substitution by a totally non-SD sequence, aAuccuca, led to a further reduction in frameshift product synthesis and a total disappearance of the AUU-initiated product (Fig. 5A,  lane 9, m202) . In a third set of constructs, six other SD variations were tested (Fig. 5A, lanes 16 to 21) . The first two have 4 (m240; UcAGGAaa) and 6 (m241; UAAGGAaa) consecutive matches, respectively; they both display a severe reduction in initiation and a moderate but significant (3-and 2-fold) reduction in frameshifting. The four others correspond to the aAuGGNGG series (the capitalized nucleotides are Those which have Watson-Crick pairing potential with the CCUC Cuua end of 16S RNA). Among them, only aAuGGcGG, and to a lesser extent aAuGGuGG, are affected in initiation and, less severely, in frameshifting. These results confirm that SD B has a dual role of frameshift stimulator and essential element for AUU initiation. They also provide hindsight on tolerance of SD B to sequence variation. As is, SD B is optimal for frameshifting and for initiation. Both roles rely on the ability of SD B to pair, at least partly, with the CCUCCUUA sequence at the 3\u0408 end of 16S RNA. Further evidence for that was obtained using \"specialized\" ribosomes (47), i.e., ribosomes in which the terminal sequence of 16S RNA has been mutated to GGAGGUUA (see Materials and Methods). These ribosomes initiate only on messages in which SD sequences are modified to restore the possibility of pairing, partially or totally; consequently, the optimal SD sequence becomes UAACCUCC instead of UAAGGAGG This SD change was introduced into pAN127 in front of lacZ to generate vector pOFX305 (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). In addition, it proved necessary to change the AUG start codon to AUU in order to render initiation strictly SD dependent (otherwise, in this context at least, the AUG codon is sufficient to promote initiation). IS911 frameshift regions, modified in the SD B region, were then cloned into pOFX305. Frameshifting frequency was determined by a \u2424-galactosidase assay, using an in-frame construct as a reference (m297). The results indicate that frameshifting is correlated with the extent of pairing between SD B and the 3\u0408 ends of specialized ribosomes. It ranges from 30.6% (m298; perfect match of 8 nucleotides) to 7.7% (m299; 5 matches, 4 of which are consecutive, like in the wild-type IS911 region) and goes down to 2.5% when there is no significant pairing (m300).",

Since the equivalent SD sequence in the IS911 signal has a dual function, it was important to perform a similar analysis, taking into account this specificity. The SD B to shift motif spacing is 11 nucleotides (Fig. 1 and 2A) . It was either reduced to 5 or 8 nt (by removing nucleotides between the SD sequence and the AUU codon) (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 3) or increased up to 35 nt (Fig. 5B , lanes 5 to 9) by inserting nucleotides between the AUU codon and the A-AAA-AAG motif. Reduced spacing negatively affects both frameshifting and initiation. Increased spacing, while keeping constant the SD B -AUU interval, diminishes frameshifting notably only above 17 nt. Meanwhile, AUU initiation undergoes a progressive increase and reaches a stable level of 12%, with a spacing of 23 or more nucleotides. Thus, the SD B region of IS911 is optimally positioned to stimulate frameshifting. The SD B -to-AUU spacing is close to the optimal SD-AUG initiator distance (41) . However, proximity to the branched stem-loop impairs initiation, whereas presence of the AUU codon does not affect frameshifting (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 and 6) .

A more detailed study of the effect on frameshifting of the distance between the stimulatory SD B and the A-AAA-AAG motif was carried out in view of an intriguing finding revealed by a comparative analysis of 355 transposable elements of the IS3 family. Among these, 56% have an SD-like sequence preceding a potential frameshift site (16) . In order to compare the position of the SD sequence, we calculated for each IS the \"corrected spacing\" (41) between the SD and the frameshift motif (Fig. 6A) . The corrected spacing for initiation is the number of nucleotides between the ribosomal P site, which contains the AUG start codon, and the last 3\u0408 nucleotide of the SD, the one paired to (or in apposition to, if not complementary) nucleotide 1535 of 16S RNA: thus in the two mRNA examples shown in Fig. 6A , the corrected spacing is 8 nt, even though the two SD sequences are not identical. By analogy, we define the corrected spacing for \u03ea1 frameshifting as the distance between the P site occupied by the XXZ codon of an X-XXZ-ZZN shifty heptamer (i.e., AAA in the example of Fig. 6A ) and the last 3\u0408 nucleotide of the SD sequence, the one paired to (or in apposition to, if not complementary) nucleotide 1535 of 16S RNA. For example, the two mRNAs shown in the middle part of Fig. 6A have the same spacing of 11 nt. We first carried out a search of initiator SD sequences in front of E. coli ORFs (Fig. 6A, bottom) : it appears that most ORFs have an SD sequence located 3 to 11 nt upstream of the start codon, with a preferred spacing of 6 nt. The same search performed on the IS frameshift regions revealed a strikingly different pattern (Fig. 6B, top) : there is a marked preference for a discrete number of spacings with a phasing of 3 nt. The highly prevalent corrected spacings (86%) are 8, 11, and 14 nt. Such a strong bias among IS suggested either (i) that the phasing of an SD sequence with a shift site could be important FIG. 6 .

The bottom diagram shows the distribution of corrected spacers upstream of the proposed start codon of 2,928 E. coli genes (see Materials and Methods). (B) The top diagram shows the corrected spacing for SD sequences upstream of potential frameshift motifs present in 198 IS3 family members.

We therefore carried out a more complete analysis by increasing the corrected SD spacing by one nucleotide at a time, from 5 to 20 nt, using the IS911 and dnaX frameshift regions (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The results presented in the middle and bottom panels of Fig. 6B show that there is in both cases a gradual increase and then a steady decrease in frameshifting frequency. The maximum is for a spacing of 10 nt for dnaX and around 10 to 12 nt for IS911. Thus, this lack of correlation between the prevalent spacings in the IS and any peculiarity in frameshifting frequency invalidate the hypothesis that SD phasing with respect to the shift site is important. To explore the second possibility, we carried out an analysis of codon usage around the frameshift motif in 355 selected IS3 family members (see Materials and Methods). Among those with an upstream SD, there is a clear bias for a glutamic acid GAG codon, constituting the core of a good SD sequence, as the fourth (10%), fifth (39%), or sixth (17.5%) codon upstream of the XXZ codon of the X-XXZ-ZZN motif; note that, when GAG is preceded by an NNG codon or followed by a GNN codon, the result is an SD sequence with a corrected spacing of 8, 11, or 14 nt (Fig. 6A ). In the IS without SD, a glutamic acid codon is also nearly as frequent at the same three positions (10%, 39%, and 21%), but it is more often encoded by GAA rather than GAG (5.6%, 17%, and 1.2%). In conclusion, the preferred positions for frameshift-stimulating SD sequences in the IS3 family most likely reflect a constraint for glutamic acid in that region of the OrfA and/or OrfAB proteins.",

Reducing the stimulatory capacity of SD B (this study) or of the branched stem-loop (39) brings a similar diminution of transposition frequency. Thus, the level of frameshifting directly determines the level of transposition. Obviously, transposition has to be kept within a certain range to ensure maintenance of the element without deleterious effects to its host. To do so, IS911 evolved toward a compromise by joining an upstream SD sequence, inherently as efficient as that of dnaX, to a downstream stem-loop structure barely stimulatory by itself. SD B , an optimally designed and positioned frameshift stimulator. Our analyses of variations in the sequence and position of SD B suggests that the critical factors for maximal frameshift stimulation are (i) 4 consecutive interacting nucleotides from the core GGAGG sequence (Fig. 5) and (ii) the SD sequenceto-motif distance (Fig. 6) . Thus, the wild-type SD B of IS911 appears optimal according to these two criteria. The main difference between SD sequences used for regular initiation and those used for frameshifting stimulation is positioning relative to the ribosomal P site. The preferred and functionally optimal corrected spacing for initiating SD sequences in E. coli is 6 nt (Fig. 6A) (11) . For frameshifting, the optimal spacing is around 9 to 12 nt (Fig. 6B) . The purpose of the anti-SD-SD interaction is to position the initiation codon in the P site. A longer-than-optimal spacing (when the XXZ codon of an X-XXZ-ZZN motif is in the P site) should therefore tend to push the mRNA so as to reduce the anti-SD-SD helix to P-site distance and thus stimulate frameshifting in the minus direction. This raises an interesting possibility which remains to be investigated: in the case of IS911 and dnaX, where corrected spacing is, respectively, 5 and 4 nt longer than optimal for initiation, can the readjustment of the mRNA position be more than one nucleotide?",

The reason for that is at the protein level, namely, the presence of a leucine zipper motif in the region 5\u0408 of the shift site (19) . The three preferred SD spacings correlate with the presence of a glutamic acid residue (GAG or GAA codon) positioned to interact with a positively charged residue located on the parallel \u2423-helix of the coiledcoil motif (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Thus, many IS sequences exploited this constraint by using a GAG codon to specify glutamic acid and by adding an upstream NNG triplet or a downstream GNN triplet to obtain a strong GGAG or GAGG frameshift stimulatory SD sequence.",

Use of AUU as a start codon for the OrfB protein by IS911, and possibly by a few other IS, is intriguing since it is only known to be used elsewhere in bacteria for this purpose by the IF3 gene and the pcnB gene. At high levels of IF3 there is little, if any, IF3 translation initiation, whereas at low levels the opposite pertains (42) . Use of an AUU initiator by IS911 likely modulates the OrfB level. This was shown with the wild-type construct (m201) and a pair of strains (an infC \u03e9 strain and a derivative containing the infC19 mutation impairing the ability of IF3 to prevent AUU initiation). We indeed observed that AUU initiation is increased 3-fold in the infC mutant, whereas frameshifting is unaffected (data not shown). Determining whether there is regulatory significance for IS911 of IF3 influencing OrfB product synthesis awaits knowledge of its function. However, AUU may not have been selected as the initiator for IS911 orfB because of an advantage conferred by IF3 regulation. The dual use of SD B for initiation and frameshifting is likely, for spacer reasons, responsible for the initiator and shift site being adjacent. The first base of the shift site is A, which, with a 5\u0408-adjacent AUG or GUG, would introduce a UGA stop codon in frame 0. This would lead to premature termination of orfA and prevent synthesis of the frameshift product. AUUA does not generate a 0 frame stop codon (Fig. 1) .",

Synthesis of an orfB product was shown for IS150 (52) , IS3 (44) , and IS3411 (30) . Sequence analysis of the other members of that group suggests that it should occur in at least 20% of them (16) . In most cases where OrfB is made, as illustrated by IS3 (44) , or is likely to be made (as judged from sequence analysis), its synthesis proceeds via translational coupling. The stop codon of the upstream gene orfA overlaps with the orfB initiator codon. Even though the function of the OrfB protein remains elusive, the frequent conservation of its expression suggests that it must play a role in transposition, but perhaps only in certain physiological conditions or for a particular type of recombination event (this protein, as the full-length OrfAB transposase, contains an integrase-related domain [15] ). In the case of IS3, OrfB was shown to enhance the inhibitory activity of OrfA on OrfAB-mediated transposition (45) . Analyses carried out using E. coli with IS911 showed that it is dispensable for the known types of transposition events and that its overexpression cannot affect these reactions or replace the OrfAB frameshift product (37) .",

Similarly, the IS911 stem-loop, at the wild-type distance of 13 nt from the 3\u0408 end of the AUU codon, is partially inhibitory for initiation ( Fig. 4 and 5B) . Decreasing the spacing further reduces initiation by 2-fold, whereas increasing it to 19 and 25 nt augments initiation up to 4-fold. In contrast, the branched stem-loop stimulates frameshifting by about 2.5-fold at the wild-type distance of 6 nt from the 3\u0408 end of the shift site. When positioned 6 nt closer or farther, it loses its frameshifting stimulation capacity. When initiation occurs on the IS911 mRNA, the AUU codon is in the P-site and the branched stem-loop is close to, and perhaps just abutting, the entrance to the mRNA channel of the ribosome. On the contrary, when the AAA and AAG codons of the shift motif are in place for frameshifting (i.e., in the P and A sites, respectively), the structure, being 4 nt closer to the ribosome, must be engaged in the entrance of the mRNA tunnel, wedged into the aperture lined by proteins S3, S4, and S5 (54) and about 1 nt away from the ribosomal helicase active site (48) . The operating distance of the stem-loop is therefore not the same for inhibition of initiation and frameshifting stimulation. One reason could be that the stem-loop acts on an initiating ribosome (and perhaps only on the 30S subunit) in the former case, while it acts on an elongating ribosome in the latter case; one possibility is that it interferes with binding of initiation factors and another is that it may hamper binding of the 50S subunit (46) .",

While it is clear that the two stimulators of IS911 (as well as those of dnaX) can act independently, they also have a synergistic action when both are present (Fig. 2 ). This suggests their concerted action occurs during the same step of the translation elongation cycle. Even if the step in question still is a matter of debate (26) and if the exact molecular mechanism of their action is not known, they likely both act on the realignment of the mRNA within the ribosome. The SD, trapped by the anti-SD sequence for more than one elongation cycle (Fig. 6) (22) , probably pushes the mRNA forward (as explained above in the section on SD B ). The stem-loop, when brought to the proper distance by translocation (5 to 7 nt from the ribosomal A site) (24) , likely becomes transiently blocked within the entrance of the mRNA tunnel, thus inducing tension in the message segment inside the ribosome (9, 18) . One way to interpret the synergy is that after the anti-SD-SD pairing forms and translocation continues, the resulting conformational change makes the ribosome more sensitive to the stimulatory effects of the 3\u0408 structure blocked at or very near the unwinding site (48, 54) . In the case of the dnaX stimulators, the synergy is apparently less important than with those of IS911 (Fig. 2B) . The dnaX stimulators, being similar to those of IS911, likely possess a similar synergistic potential. As suggested in the previous section, this potential is probably counterbalanced by frameshift-limiting ribosomal features, the efficiency of which increases with that of frameshifting.",

This study, together with a recent comparative analysis of 355 transposable elements from the IS3 family (16) and previous analyses of a few cases (13, 25, 30, 36, 44, 50, 52) , highlight the modular architecture and the high flexibility in design of PRF-1 regions of bacterial origin. By the choice of the mandatory frameshift motif, and of the nature and position of the optional upstream and downstream stimulators, a wide range of frameshifting frequencies is probably attained. The outcome of \u03ea1 frameshifting is the generation of protein diversity through rather simple signals (e.g., synthesis of two proteins out of one gene in dnaX and synthesis of up to three proteins out of two genes in IS911); thus, one would expect it to be widespread. However, most known examples of bacterial programmed \u03ea1 frameshifting are found in bacteriophages or transposable elements (2) , and intriguingly, dnaX still remains the only clear example of a housekeeping gene using \u03ea1 frameshifting for its expression. At a time where over a thousand complete bacterial genomic sequences are available, a thorough search of candidate genes using this mode of expression still remains to be carried out to determine whether or not this strong bias is indeed biologically significant.",

The standard deviation for frameshifting (or AUU initiation) frequency was \u03ee7% on average. Sequence analyses. In order to determine the position of initiating SD sequences among E. coli K-12 ORFs, a script for the Perl language (v.5.10.0 from ActiveState) was devised to extract from the genome sequence (GenBank accession number U00096) 30 nucleotides 5\u0408 of the start codon of each ORF. A second script was used to look for SD sequences (the search was restricted to the following SD sequences: NGAGG, GGAGH, HAGGAHN, NGGGG, GGGGH, NGTGG, and GGTGH where the rightmost base correspond to the last base of the GGAGG consensus core SD sequence) and to calculate the corrected spacing of each (see Fig. 6A and Results) (41). A similar analysis was carried out on 198 elements of the IS3 family possessing a potential frameshift stimulatory SD sequence upstream of a frameshift motif (Fig. 6B). For codon analysis, a segment of 39 nucleotides (nt) from the frameshift region (30 nt upstream of the ZZN codon of the motif and 6 nt downstream) was retained for each of the 355 selected IS. Sequences were formatted with a Perl script to separate codons and were then entered into a Microsoft Excel table to allow sorting and calculation of the codon frequency at each position. Potential RNA secondary structures were assessed with the RNAstructure v.5.1 software (40).",
