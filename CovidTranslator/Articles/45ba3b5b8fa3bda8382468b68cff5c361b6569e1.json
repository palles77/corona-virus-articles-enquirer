            "text": "Despite the fact that there had been multiple small outbreaks of Ebola Virus Disease, when a large outbreak occurred in 2014 there were no vaccines or drugs available for use. Clinical development of multiple candidate vaccines was then initiated in parallel with attempts to contain the outbreak but only one vaccine was eventually tested in a phase III trial. In order to be better prepared for future outbreaks of known human pathogens, platform technologies to accelerate vaccine development should be employed, allowing vaccine developers to take advantage of detailed knowledge of the vaccine platform and facilitating rapid progress to clinical trials and eventually to vaccine stockpiles. This review gives an example of one such vaccine platform, replication-deficient simian adenoviruses, and describes progress in human and livestock vaccine development for three outbreak pathogens, Ebola virus, Rift Valley Fever Virus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.

Deleting the E1 gene from the adenoviral genome and supplying it in trans from the cell line used to produce the adenoviral vector allows replication-deficient recombinant viruses to be produced, with the novel gene of interest inserted at the E1 locus. However the inherent immunogenicity of adenoviral vectors makes them more suited to use as vaccine vectors, and the ability to drive expression of the vaccine antigen intracellularly after vaccination results in the induction of both T cell and humoral responses to the antigen. Human adenoviruses are highly immunogenic in mice and other species but as many humans have previously been infected by common human adenoviruses such as AdHu5, anti-vector antibodies generated after the initial infection can neutralise a vaccine based on the same adenovirus, thus reducing immunogenicity. In contrast, the level of neutralising antibodies to simian adenoviruses is very low in human populations, and a number of differ-ent replication-deficient vaccine vectors such as ChAd3, ChAd63 [1] and ChAdOx1 [2] have now been developed from simian adenoviruses.",

            "text": "Between 1976 and 2013 the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 24 localised outbreaks of Ebola virus disease involving a total of 1716 cases, with a fatality rate of between 25% and 90%. No drugs or vaccines were available to treat or prevent this devastating infectious disease. Outbreaks were contained by contact tracing and quarantine [3] . Vaccine development had begun, and by 2014 two different viral vectored vaccines had shown protective efficacy against a high dose Ebola virus challenge in non-human primates (NHP) and were being prepared for clinical development. These were a replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector, ChAd3 [4] , and a replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [5] , each expressing the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus from either the Zaire or Sudan species. Additionally a replicationdeficient human adenovirus 5 vaccine was protective in the same NHP challenge model [6] but in a clinical trial, pre-existing immunity to the vaccine vector resulted in variable immune responses to the Ebola glycoprotein [7] , with the result that the ChAd3-vectored vaccine, with very low pre-existing immunity to the vaccine vector was the preferred option for further clinical testing. The ChAd3-vectored vaccine had already been manufactured in preparation for a clinical trial, and commencement of the first phase I study was accelerated. A phase I trial of a ChAd3vectored vaccine against hepatitis C had already been completed [8] , and the safety and immunogenicity data from that study were used to support rapid regulatory and ethical review of the Ebola vaccine which was then tested in a series of phase I studies [9] [10] [11] . By the end of 2014 several trials had produced safety and immunogenicity data and discussions on the location and design of an efficacy study were underway. However the first efficacy trial, of the VSV-vectored vaccine which by that time had also been tested in several phase I trials, did not begin until April 2015 by which time the number of cases had markedly declined. The VSV-vectored vaccine proved to be highly effective [12] , but there was no opportunity to test efficacy of the ChAd3-vectored vaccine. A subsequent comparison of total IgG and neutralising antibody responses to each vaccine revealed strikingly similar immunogenicity [10] , making it likely that the ChAd3-vectored vaccine would be equally protective, but less reactogenic than the VSVvectored vaccine. Thus, following an outbreak of a disease which resulted in 28,616 known cases and 11,310 deaths, lasting from the first case in December 2013 to the end of virus transmission in June 2016, and for which two vaccines were well advanced in pre-clinical development and preparation for clinical trials before the outbreak began, it was only possible to test efficacy of one of these vaccines in the declining months of the outbreak.",

The WHO has announced a priority list (see Table 1 ) for which measures (diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines) should be developed in advance of any further outbreaks. Vaccine development should encompass pre-clinical testing, preferably determining vaccine efficacy in a suitable animal model, and phase I clinical trials can be completed to assess safety and immunogenicity, where possible comparing immune responses to known correlates of protection in animal models. Vaccine stockpiles could then be produced, with plans for an efficacy trial put in place in readiness to test the vaccine for efficacy as soon as an outbreak occurs. However vaccine development is a slow process, typically taking 10-15 years to achieve vaccine licensure, at considerable cost. For emerging pathogen vaccines, employing platform technologies to develop vaccines against multiple diseases could save considerable amounts of time and money in the efforts to protect the world against novel pathogens. Replication-deficient simian adenovirus-vectored vaccines are already in development for all of the pathogens on the WHO priority list as well as others, and progress on two of them is summarised below.",

Virus transmission between susceptible hosts occurs via numerous mosquito species but humans can also acquire infection from handling contaminated animal fluids or tissue [14] . Following its first isolation in 1930 in Kenya [15] , RVF virus has spread throughout much of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, causing recurrent outbreaks of human and livestock illness [14] . Disease in livestock is characterised by high rates (>90%) of neonatal mortality and abortion in pregnant animals [13] . In humans RVF presents as an acute selflimiting febrile illness but severe manifestations can also occur, including haemorrhage and encephalitis, with high (>30%) case fatality rates [16, 17] . However, RVF is probably under-reported and its true burden remains unknown. For instance, miscarriage in pregnant women has only recently been identified as a possible outcome of RVF infection [18] , underscoring the need for better surveillance in areas that are endemic for RVF transmission.",

Severe or fatal infections occur in older adults who are to some extent immunocompromised [29] . This population may not make strong immune responses following vaccination, and it would be necessary to vaccinate large numbers to prevent further cases. Vaccinating camels to eliminate the infection in the Middle East would prevent human exposure, but will likely require government intervention since the disease in camels is mild and does not appear to result in economic losses to the camel owners. Vaccination of imported camels would need to be maintained, and in the short-term vaccination of those occupationally exposed to camels, or healthcare workers, may be beneficial to prevent further human to human spread. The burden of disease in African countries where MERS seropositive camels have been found is not yet understood. This presents a complex series of public health problems, which will be difficult to solve. The ability to employ a well-characterised platform technology for both camel and human vaccine development would result in some reduction of the complexity.",

By selecting a small number of platform technologies to use it will be possible to plan all aspects of vaccine manufacturing and clinical develop-ment with advance knowledge of the expected thermostability, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of vaccines against multiple different diseases. Prior knowledge of the safety of a given vaccine platform technology in adults, children, infants, older adults and HIV positive individuals will aid in the design and conduct of vaccine trials to be conducted rapidly when an outbreak occurs. In some cases, parallel development of a veterinary and human vaccine could result in deployment of the veterinary vaccine to control the animal reservoir of disease and prevent human exposure at the same time as preparing a stockpile for use in humans should an outbreak occur. Additionally, when the next previously unknown pathogen emerges, the options for rapid vaccine development, the steps to be taken, the facilities to be used and the time needed to prepare doses for human use will be far better understood.",

For vaccines against pathogens that typically cause small outbreaks, such as Rift Valley Fever virus, it may be necessary to seek regulatory approval based on safety and immunogenicity in humans, plus efficacy in a relevant animal species, but the requirements for this approach have not yet been agreed with regulatory authorities. Once again, the use of a platform technology will be advantageous as vaccine safety data from the clinical use of all vaccines using the same platform will be relevant.",
