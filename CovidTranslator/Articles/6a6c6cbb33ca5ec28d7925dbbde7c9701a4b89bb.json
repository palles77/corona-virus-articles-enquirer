            "text": "The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic affected over 30 countries, 1 mainly in Asia and Northern America, and involved more than 8000 probable cases and more than 700 deaths worldwide. 2 New cases were reported in 2004. 3 Several hospital outbreaks occurred, affecting both patients and healthcare workers. 4, 5 It has been suggested that healthcare workers who are exposed to SARS patients can be infected with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), regardless of the intensity of exposure. 6 This has alerted the global infection control community. Management of infected patients consisted of isolation and strict respiratory and contact precautions. 7 A case-control study among 241 non-infected and 13 infected staff members with documented exposure to 11 index SARS patients suggested that wearing a face mask is the most important infection control tool, followed by appropriate hand hygiene, 8 suggesting that droplets and hands play a major role in transmission of SARS-CoV. Hands may be contaminated by patient excretions or contact with contaminated surfaces. From the inanimate environment, nosocomial pathogens can be transmitted to hands quite easily. 9 SARS-CoV has been described to persist on surfaces for up to 96 h. 10 In another study, dried SARS-CoV retained its infectivity for as long as six days, indicating a relatively strong survival ability. Only after nine days in a dried state did SARS-CoV completely lose its infectivity. 11 Results of a cohort study among visitors of a hotel suggested that environmental contamination should be considered as a possible source of infection. 12 The Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany has recommended the use of disinfectants that have complete virucidal activity including the spectrum of non-enveloped viruses. 13 The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that standard disinfectants should be effective against SARS-CoV, 14 but experimental evidence is not available to date. This is why we have investigated the activity of various disinfectants against SARS-CoV.",

Four were alcohol-based hand disinfectants: Sterillium, based on 45% iso-propanol, 30% n-propanol and 0.2% mecetronium etilsulphate; Sterillium Rub, based on 80% ethanol; Sterillium Gel, based on 85% ethanol; and Sterillium Virugard, based on 95% ethanol. All alcohol-based hand rubs were tested without dilution. Three products were surface disinfectants: Mikrobac forte, based on benzalkonium chloride and laurylamine; Korsolin FF, based on benzalkonium chloride, glutaraldehyde and didecyldimonium chloride; and Dismozon pur, based on magnesium monoperphthalate. The surface disinfectants were tested at the recommended concentration for the recommended application time at which they have been shown to have bactericidal and yeasticidal activity, as well as sufficient efficacy in tests under practical conditions. 15 The instrument disinfectant Korsolex basic, based on glutaraldehyde and (ethylenedioxy) dimethanol, was included due to the possible transmission of SARS-CoV by flexible bronchoscopes. The product was tested at the recommended concentration and application time that has been shown to have bactericidal and yeasticidal activity, as well as sufficient efficacy in tests under practical conditions. 15 Test procedure Viruses and cells SARS-CoV isolate FFM-1 16 was obtained from the sputum of a patient hospitalized with a diagnosis of probable SARS in the Isolation Unit of Frankfurt University Hospital, Germany. SARS-CoV were grown in Vero cell cultures (African green monkey kidney, ATCC no. CCL-81). The maintenance medium consisted of minimum essential medium (MEM) without fetal calf serum (FCS) and containing 100 IU/mL of penicillin and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin. Virus stock was stored at K80 8C. Infectious virus titres were calculated as described by K\u00e4rber 17 and Spearman, 18 and determined as 50% tissue culture infective doses. Different virus stocks were used for the experiments. The initial log 10 virus titres were between 8.93G0.25 and 9.30G0.38. In accordance with WHO recommendations, all work involving infectious SARS-CoV was performed under biosafety level (BSL)-3 conditions in a BSL-3 facility.",

The organic loads used were 0.3% albumin, 10% FCS, and 0.3% albumin with 0.3% sheep erythrocytes. Immediately after incubation for defined periods of time at RT, the mixture was diluted 1:10 with ice-cold MEM and put into an ice bath to avoid an extension of the effective incubation period. Serial 10-fold dilutions with ice-cold MEM were performed to assess virus titres as described above. For each dilution step, eight wells containing suspended cells were inoculated. After three to four days of incubation at 37 8C in an CO 2 incubator, cells were microscopically examined for virus-specific cytopathogenic effects. All tests were performed in triplicate, and for each experiment, a virus control containing MEM instead of disinfectant was included ('control titration').",

The mean RF with the instrument disinfectant was R3.3, SD 0.5, which is nearly tenfold below the results of the other disinfectants, due to initial virus titre which was tenfold lower. The results of the controls (data not presented) showed that the termination controls had nearly the same titre as the 'control titration'.

Alcohols have been described to have immediate, very good activity 22 against many different enveloped viruses such as orthopoxvirus, 23,24 influenza A virus, 23,24 herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, 24 Newcastle disease virus, 25 togavirus, 26 hepatitis B virus [27] [28] [29] and human immunodeficiency virus. 24, 30, 31 Our finding with SARS-CoV is therefore in line with previously reported data against many other enveloped viruses. The use of alcohol-based hand rubs after contamination of the hands with SARS-CoV, e.g. by respiratory secretions during patient contact, should be effective to prevent further transmission of SARS-CoV by healthcare workers' hands.",

That is why the disinfection of surfaces provides additional safety to control the spread of SARS-CoV from inanimate surfaces in an outbreak situation. The three tested surface disinfectants were all effective against SARS-CoV at the concentration and exposure time recommended for routine disinfection of surfaces. 15 The recommendation is derived from experimental evidence which includes bactericidal and yeasticidal activity in suspension tests, and which provides sufficient efficacy under practical conditions. 15 This spectrum of activity appears to include SARS-CoV. prEN 14476 allows surface disinfectants to be tested at exposure times of 5 and 15 min, as well as 30 and 60 min. Shorter times are more relevant to the exposure times used in practice for surface disinfection (i.e. before drying), and are usually achieved with higher concentrations of the surface disinfectant. Especially in critical areas such as paediatric intensive care, a higher concentration of surface disinfectants provides more safety and is preferable. 32 One instrument disinfectant was tested against SARS-CoV. Patients with SARS may require a bronchoscopy. The flexible endoscope will be processed after use and must not spread the virus to any other patient. Different approaches to achieve optimum results during reprocessing flexible endoscopes are currently debated worldwide, [33] [34] [35] [36] but the minimum spectrum of activity for an instrument disinfectant has not yet been defined. We were able to show that a standard instrument disinfectant achieved sufficient activity against SARS-CoV using the recommended concentration and exposure time, 15 indicating that SARS-CoV is quite easily inactivated.",

Against other enveloped viruses, an ethanolbased hand rub was also described to be effective under different types of organic load. 24 Against the feline calicivirus (FCV), however, there was a significant influence of the type of organic load on the efficacy of 70% ethanol and 70% iso-propanol; FCS did not impair the efficacy against FCV but the presence of albumin or sheep erythrocytes significantly reduced the efficacy of the alcohols. 37 Our data indicate that sufficient activity against SARS-CoV can be expected with the tested disinfectants, regardless of the type of organic load.
