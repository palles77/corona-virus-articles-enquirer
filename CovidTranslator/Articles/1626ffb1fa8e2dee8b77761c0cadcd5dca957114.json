            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses of positive-sense polarity. Their genomes range from approximately 26 to 32 kb in size [16] . The family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales is divided into the four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Bats are the projected host reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are thought to be the host for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses [18] . The two betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), were transmitted by civet cats and camels, respectively, to humans, but they have shown limited capacity for adaptation to humans [16] . Some CoVs can be transmitted to different animal species, and subsequently adapt to and be maintained in the new host, because they can exploit or share a variety of host cell surface molecules or other undefined factors [16] . The species Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes acute diarrhea, dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets [9] . For the last four decades, since the first appearance of PEDV in 1977, PEDV infection has resulted in significant economic losses in the European, Asian and US swine industries. PEDV has been found only within the pig population, indicating that the virus might have adapted only to pigs [9] . The species Porcine deltacoronavirus belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus. Porcine deltavoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel enteropathogenic CoV infecting pigs and was previously reported in birds [10] . PDCoV was first identified in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012 [18] and the associated enteric disease was first reported in US swine only in early 2014 [17] . However, the origin of PDCoV infection in pigs and also the sudden emergence and route of introduction of this virus in the US remains unclear [10] . PDCoV may have only partially adapted to pigs and still retain some potential to infect different animal species, particularly poultry or other livestock, which can often have frequent contact with pigs in small-scale, backyard farms in the US. Therefore, our aim was to determine whether calves are susceptible to infection with either the newly emerged PDCoV or the swine enteric CoV, PEDV. Fecal virus shedding, seroconversion and histopathology were evaluated in gnotobiotic (Gn) calves orally inoculated with PDCoV or PEDV. The PDCoV OH-FD22 virus was isolated and then serially passaged five times (P5) in LLC porcine kidney (LLC-PK) cells (ATCC CL-101) [2] . The virus was orally inoculated and propagated in a 9-day-old Gn pig. The viral RNA titer of OH-FD22-P5 used as inoculum in the intestinal contents (ICs) was 9.0 log 10 genomic equivalents (GE)/ml. The wild-type US PEDV strain PC21A, propagated in a Gn pig [7] , was also used in this study. All ICs were negative for other enteric viruses, such as rotavirus groups A-C, by PCR/RT-PCR [6] .",

Calves #1-4 were inoculated orally with 9.0-9.6 log 10 GE of the OH-FD22-P5, and calves #5-7 were inoculated orally with 10.2-12.5 log 10 GE of the PC21A (Table 1) . After viral inoculation, we monitored clinical signs daily. Diarrhea was assessed by scoring fecal consistency as follows: 0=solid; 1=pasty; 2=semi-liquid; 3=liquid, with scores of 2 or more considered diarrheic. Calves #1 (PDCoV) and #5 (PEDV) were monitored for long-term clinical signs and virus shedding until post-inoculation day (PID) 16-17. The other inoculated or mock-infected calves were kept for short-term studies and were euthanized for histopathological examination at acute to mild stages (PIDs 3, 8 or 9) of viral infection (Table 1) .",

Fecal PDCoV RNA titers, ranging from 7.2 to 8.4 log 10 GE/ml, peaked at PID 2 (calf #2), PID 3 (calf #1), or PID 4-6 (calf #3) ( Table 1) . Calf #1, was followedup long-term and had prolonged viral RNA shedding until PID 16 (Fig. 1) . The highest fecal PDCoV RNA titer of calf #1 was at PID 3 (8.4 log 10 GE/ml), and the titers decreased progressively thereafter (Fig. 1) . On the other hand, none of the Gn calves inoculated with PEDV shed detectable PEDV RNA in the feces at PIDs 1-9 (calves #6 and #7) and PIDs 1-17 (calf #5). The negative control (calf #8) did not shed detectable PDCoV or PEDV RNA in the feces during the experiment. Nasal swab or serum samples collected from PDCoV-inoculated calf #1 were also tested by qRT-PCR. Serum samples were collected at PIDs 3 and 15, and nasal swab samples were collected at PIDs 2, 6, 9, 13, and 16. No PDCoV RNA was detected in the serum (\\3.6 log 10 GE/ml) and nasal swab (\\5.3 log 10 GE/ml) samples tested at the time-points indicated. IFA showed that calf #1 had serum IgG antibodies (titer of 1,024) against PDCoV OH-FD22 at PID 16, indicating seroconversion. Large numbers of IF-stained cells were consistently observed when PDCoV-infected LLC-PK cells were incubated with the serum diluted 1:4 to 1:1,024 (Fig. 2) . No PDCoV-specific IgG antibodies were detected in the prebled serum samples of calf #1 and negative control calf #8 (Fig. 2) . In PEDV-inoculated calf #5, there were no detectable PEDV-specific IgG antibodies in the serum samples at PID 0 and PID 17 (Fig. 2) . Light microscopy analysis revealed that none of the PDCoV-or PEDV-inoculated calves had major histological changes in the intestine. Additionally, by IF, no PDCoV or PEDV antigen-positive cells were observed in the small and large intestinal tissues of PDCoV or PEDV-inoculated Gn calves, while the intestinal tissues (mainly villous enterocytes) of PDCoV or PEDVinfected Gn pigs were found to be positive for PDCoV or PEDV antigen in earlier studies [6, 8] .",

These observations are similar to a previous report showing that, human SARS-CoV strain Urbani, prior to its adaptation to mice (MA105 strain), replicated in the lungs of young mice, as indicated by their lung homogenates testing positive by qRT-PCR. However, the Urbani strain-inoculated mice did not show any clinical signs, but only mild histological lesions with low expression of viral antigens [13] . In our study, there were no detectable fecal viral RNA shedding, virus-specific serum IgG antibody responses, histological lesions, and clinical disease in Gn calves orally inoculated with the PEDV strain PC21A (ICs of wild-type PEDV-infected Gn pigs) [6] . For the past 40 years, PEDV has been found only within pigs, indicating that PEDV may have only adapted to pigs [9] . In contrast, PDCoV may not yet be completely adapted to pigs, and the disease caused by PDCoV has emerged only 2-3 years ago. PDCoV-infected pigs appeared to shed less PDCoV RNA and had a lower peak of viral titer in the feces, compared with experimental PEDV infections [7, 11] , suggesting that there is a lower replication of PDCoV in the intestine of pigs, possibly due to its incomplete adaptation to pigs.",

However, DCoVs were detected previously in rectal swabs of small mammals, such as Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers, in live-animal markets in China, in 2005-2006 [1] . The helicase and S genes of the CoVs isolated from the wild small mammals were closely related to those of PDCoV [18] , suggesting that a potential interspecies transmission event may have occurred leading to DCoV transmission between wild small mammals and pigs. However, further studies are needed to define the potential role of small mammals as an intermediate host of PDCoV and the mechanisms of interspecies transmission of DCoVs between small mammals and domestic pigs or wild birds. Our data also support the Fig. 1 Persisting fecal viral RNA shedding of calf #1 inoculated with PDCoV strain OH-FD22-P5, but without diarrhea. Calf #1 was inoculated orally with 9.6 log 10 GE of the gnotobiotic pig-passaged OH-FD22-P5. It was monitored for long-term clinical signs and virus shedding at PIDs 1 to 16. Rectal swabs were collected daily throughout the experiment. The PDCoV fecal shedding titers were determined by qRT-PCR. The dotted line indicates the detection limit (4.6 log 10 GE/ml) of the qRT-PCR potential ability of the newly emerged PDCoV to infect another animal species, such as cattle [16] . However, our study did not demonstrate PDCoV's ability of direct interspecies transmission between pigs and cattle.",

Based on our data, it is possible that interactions between PDCoV S protein and the host cell receptor or co-receptor binding may occur in the bovine intestine, whereas this may not be the case for PEDV S protein. The major cellular receptors of PEDV and PDCoV in pigs are unknown [10, 14] . The CoV S proteins can be divided into two functional subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 is involved in the receptor recognition and binding via the N-terminal or C-terminal virus receptor binding domains. Therefore, proteolysis between S1 and S2 is a critical determinant for CoV tropism and pathogenesis. The CoV S proteins can be cleaved by different animal proteases [15] . The extent of cleavage of PEDV and PDCoV S proteins might differ in the bovine intestine, possibly depending on their adaptation to the bovine intestinal environment; for example, exogenous proteolytic enzymes of bovine origin may influence PEDV or PDCoV S proteinhost cell receptor binding. However, these assumptions should be verified by further studies.",

There were also no PDCoV RNApositive nasal or serum samples from PDCoV-inoculated calf #1, indicating that PDCoV infection may be limited to the intestine, similar to PDCoV infections in pigs [10] , although PDCoV-infected pigs also showed viremia (viral RNA in serum) [10] . Our study did not identify which type of cells in the intestines of inoculated calves could be the target for PDCoV replication, resulting in fecal shedding. Our IF staining experiments identified PDCoV antigen-positive cells in intestinal tissues from PDCoV-infected Gn pigs used as positive controls. Similar to the GIII.2 bovine norovirus (CV186-OH strain) that was shown to cause fecal virus RNA shedding in infected Gn calves, but in the absence of histological lesions or viral antigen/RNA in the intestine [5] , PDCoV did not induce major histological changes in the intestine of Gn calves, such as necrosis of intestinal epithelium or villous atrophy. This result is also in line with data showing no PDCoV-positive cells in the intestinal epithelium. Based on these observations, PDCoV may have infected the intestine of calves as an attenuated virus that does not cause clinical disease and histological lesions, with low levels of viral antigen detected in enterocytes in inoculated animals. Nevertheless, our study did not clearly rule out an abortive infection with limited PDCoV replication in calves.",
