            "text": "The gastrointestinal microbiota is extremely important for human and animal health. Investigations into the composition of the microbiota and its therapeutic modification have received increasing interest in human and veterinary medicine. Probiotics are a way of modifying the microbiota and have been tested to prevent and treat diseases. Probiotics are proposed to exert their beneficial effects through various pathways. Production of antimicrobial compounds targeting intestinal pathogens, general immune stimulation, and colonization resistance are among these mechanisms. Despite widespread availability and use, scientific, peer-reviewed evidence behind commercial probiotic formulations in horses is limited. Additionally, quality control of commercial over-the-counter products is not tightly regulated. Although promising in vitro results have been achieved, in vivo health benefits have been more difficult to prove. Whether the ambiguous results are caused by strain selection, dosage selection or true lack of efficacy remains to be answered. Although these limitations exist, probiotics are increasingly used because of their lack of severe adverse effects, ease of administration, and low cost. This review summarizes the current evidence for probiotic use in equine medicine. It aims to provide veterinarians with evidence-based information on when and why probiotics are indicated for prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal disease in horses. The review also outlines the current state of knowledge on the equine microbiota and the potential of fecal microbial transplantation, as they relate to the topic of probiotics.",

Alterations in the equine intestinal microbiota are associated with acute colitis, equine grass sickness, and laminitis. 4, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Over the last decades, most studies have focused on hind gut fermentation processes related to fiber digestion, lactic acidosis and laminitis, and were conducted using culture-dependent or molecular methods. 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] A thorough understanding of the composition of the equine microbiota could not be reached because of the technical limitations of these methods. Recent advances in culture independent microbial identification and bioinformatics have opened doors towards understanding the composition of the intestinal microbiota. 4 ,23-26 The information obtained from these studies so far is based on small numbers and has statistical limitations because of different analyses of the data.",

            "text": "The microbiota is unique for each horse, but certain phyla predominate in all healthy animals. 4, 23 Firmicutes is the predominant phylum in feces accounting for 46-70% of identified sequences. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, and Spirochaetes constitute between 0% and 15% each. 23, 27 Substantial shifts in the phylum level occur in horses with gastrointestinal disease. Healthy horses have a greater abundance of Actinobacteria and Spirochetes whereas diarrheic horses have a greater abundance of Fusobacteria. 4 There is also relatively greater abundance of the order Clostridiales in healthy horses as compared to diseased horses, suggesting their importance for the health of the equine gastrointestinal tract. 4 Interestingly, there was no difference in the relative abundance of Lactobacillales between healthy and diseased horses. The order Lactobacillales contains the majority of lactic acid-producing bacteria (LAB) commonly used as probiotics. 4 Despite these data, the gut microbiota remains difficult to interpret because of its complexity. There is difficulty in differentiating cause and effect, poor understanding of the function of different components of the microbiota and problems assessing interaction of the microbiota with the horse. A detailed review of the composition of the equine microbiota in health and disease is beyond the scope of this article and can be found elsewhere. 5 Microbial composition and function are known to change along the gastrointestinal tract with changes in the most dominant phyla accounting for the major differences. 24, 28 In one study, the most dominant phyla of the large intestine were Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes, whereas in the ileum Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominated. 24 The core microbiota of different regions differed not just in composition, but also in abundance. 27 For clinical cases and in a research setting, fecal samples are mostly obtained. Biologically relevant differences likely exist among compartments of the gastrointestinal tract, complicating research, interpretation, and clinical applications.",

There currently are no approved probiotics for horses. Alternatively, probiotics can be classified as a dietary or feed supplement 'generally regarded as safe' (GRAS). In the latter case, they do not need to go through the process of drug approval. The producers are responsible for providing an expert opinion on why the product should be considered as GRAS. The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) of the FDA then can approve or reject this status (www. fda.gov.com). Although the FDA has regulatory responsibility, the ultimate responsibility lies with the manufacturing company. The FDA only requires that supplements be labeled in a truthful and not misleading manner. Labels need to be reviewed by the CVM before marketing. The labels need to contain information to identify the feed additive and details on its safe and effective use. Expressed or implied claims that a feed additive can be used to cure, treat, or prevent disease may identify intent to offer the product as an animal drug and are not allowed. However, CVM permits the use of meaningful 'health' information on the label of some animal feed products. For example, 'gastrointestinal health' claims on horse feed fall under this policy (www.fda.gov.com). Consequently, in North America, there are numerous probiotic products for use in horses on the market that can be obtained over the counter, and claim to benefit the horse in various ways. However, peer-reviewed published studies proving the efficacy of these products are limited, or in most cases lacking.",

The most recent FAO/WHO guidelines state that potential probiotic strains should be able to survive the gastric environment, have antimicrobial properties, adhere to mucus and epithelial cells and have properties to be able to withstand the rigors of production. 30 Not all LAB have probiotic properties, and even different strains of the same species can have different properties making it necessary to evaluate probiotics on a strain basis. 31 Both bacteria and yeast are used as microbial feed additives ( Table 1 ). The bacteria that comprise commercial probiotics constitute <1% of all intestinal microorganisms in total. Depending on the species and the segment of the gastrointestinal tract evaluated, their relative abundance can be much higher. 4, 27 Many probiotics for horses are designed to target the large colon of the horse where many diseases occur. The most commonly used genera for probiotics, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterococci, are not the most abundant species in the large colon of the horse. 4, 24, 27 This observation suggests that these species have less influence on the gastrointestinal health of horses. The approach of using lactobacilli or other LAB as probiotics, mainly used in humans and small animals, might be futile in horses. The focus of probiotic studies should be placed on other more abundant species. Studies investigating the effect of abundant bacterial species, such as members of the Clostridia class, are lacking to date. These classes could theoretically have a better effect than current probiotic strains.",

Technical instability of a bacterial strain is important for commercial production. This is often a limiting factor, but by evaluating strains already in commercial production this limitation can be overcome. 37 Antibiotic resistance is an important selection criterion for bacterial strains intended for use as probiotics. Transferrable resistance genes present in a probiotic bacteria's chromosome or on plasmids may be transferred horizontally to the indigenous flora and to opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. Thus, ideally, probiotics should not harbor potentially transferable resistance genes, especially those conferring resistance traits of high clinical relevance. Because most probiotic strains are members of the human or animal indigenous flora, the presence of antibiotic resistance determinants must be systemically evaluated. 38 In Europe, all probiotics on the market undergo an evaluation of their resistance gene content before they are considered for the QPS standard followed by potential marketing of a product (www.efsa.europe.eu). In North America, such a regulation is not currently in force.",

Generally, host-specific strains are believed to be able to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of the indigenous host for longer periods of time. Indeed, colonization of the adult equine gastrointestinal tract with L. rhamnosus LGG of human origin was shown to be poor. 46 After a 5-day course of probiotic administration at 3 different dosages (1 9 10 9 , 1 9 10 10 , 5 9 10 10 ), fecal recovery in 21 adults was shown to be 71%, 29%, and 86% after 24 h for each dose, respectively. After 48 h, the probiotic was recovered from the feces of 14%, 14%, and 56%, whereas 3 days after administration only 1 horse in each of the lower 2 dosage groups remained positive. Fecal recovery was longer in foals where the probiotic could be recovered up to day 9 after administration in some foals. 46 This suggests that the immature gastrointestinal flora of foals could facilitate probiotic survival. Additionally, foals and adults showed a lack of dose response, making it difficult to determine an ideal dose to use. 46 Similar results were obtained when administering Saccharomyces boulardii. 47 After administration of 10 9 10 9 cfu/g to 3 horses and 20 9 10 9 cfu/g to 2 horses for 10 days, fecal samples were negative for S. boulardii on day 20. On day 5, all horses had viable S. boulardii in their feces. 47 Similarly, S. cerevisiae has been shown to survive but not colonize the ceca and colons of horses. 17, 48, 49 This indicates that any beneficial effect of probiotics might not continue beyond the period of administration, making long-term or repeated treatment a necessity.",

The effects include fortification of the intestinal barrier by maintaining tight junctions, supporting survival of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and their growth, and induction of IgA and b-defensin production, resulting in suppression of growth of pathogens as well as systemic and local anti-inflammatory effects. 51 Anti-inflammatory effects can be achieved by the modification of cytokine production by IECs and effects on cells of the innate immune system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. 52 Probiotics and their products influence T reg cells, the subset of T-cells that plays an important role in the down-regulation of misdirected immune responses. Some probiotics are able to induce production of T reg cells, thereby exerting anti-inflammatory properties. 53 Although probiotics often exert an anti-inflammatory action, certain probiotic bacteria also can up-regulate inflammatory mediator production 54 and increase adhesion of pathogens. 55 Within the intestinal wall, B-cells differentiate into plasma cells and secrete IgA antibodies. These then are transported into the lumen and are important for mucosal-associated immunity. Certain probiotic strains are able to influence IgA production. [56] [57] [58] Systemically, probiotics can influence immunoglobulin production by altering systemic isotype profiles. 54 Probiotics have diverse effects on the immune system. Such effects can be stimulatory or inhibitory depending on the biological features of individual probiotic strains. Most of the above studies, assessing the effects of probiotics on the host, have been conducted using human or laboratory animal cell lines, but equivalent studies are lacking for horses. Given the conservation of the immune system across all species, it is likely that similar effects would occur in horses.",

This indicates that the bedding could have been the reason for the allergic reaction. 72 The effect of probiotics in foals is likely to be different from that in adult horses because of major difference in gastrointestinal microbiota composition. 78 Although several published studies demonstrate safety of commercially available and self-made probiotics in foals, 74, 79 there are also reports on adverse enteric effects. 75 A self-made probiotic product containing Lactobacillus pentosus isolated from a healthy foal was evaluated for its ability to prevent neonatal diarrhea. 75 In a preliminary study, this probiotic was administered to 9 healthy foals and no adverse effects were seen. 74 When the probiotic was administered to healthy neonates in a clinical placebo-controlled field trial, the treatment group showed increased incidence of diarrhea and need for veterinary intervention. 75 Although it is unclear why these foals developed diarrhea, the immature microbiota of the foals could have allowed overgrowth of LAB, resulting in osmotic imbalances and diarrhea.

In addition to the confounding factor of additional treatments, the number of cases was low, with only 7 horses per group. 47 Saccharomyces boulardii also was assessed as an adjunctive treatment in horses affected with antimicrobial-associated enterocolitis in a randomized placebocontrolled clinical trial involving 12 horses. 77 No significant differences were observed between groups for occurrence of normal fecal consistency or cessation of watery diarrhea. Also, days to improvement in attitude, resolution of leukopenia, appetite, normal heart rate, normal respiratory rate, normal temperature, duration of stay in hospital, survival to discharge, and occurrence of secondary complications was not different between groups. The authors postulated that the lack of efficacy could be attributable to a lack of colonization by S. boulardii because the fecal samples of some horses were negative for S. boulardii. 77 Although this study was influenced by fewer confounding factors and evaluated more clinical parameters compared to the previously described study, 47 the number of cases was low and adjunctive treatment was variable among horses, making interpretation of the results difficult.",

Five clusters of gastrointestinal diseases were evenly distributed between treatment groups but no differences in Salmonella shedding rates were found between treatment groups. The overall shedding rate was 21%. Prevalence of postoperative diarrhea, duration of antimicrobial therapy, and duration of hospitalization were not statistically different between the groups. 76 In a later placebo-controlled randomized trial, the effects of a multistrain commercial probiotic (Table 1) on Salmonella shedding, prevalence of diarrhea, leukopenia and fever were evaluated in colic cases with various underlying diseases. 81 Ninety-six horses were enrolled and received probiotics or placebo once daily for up to 5 days. The overall shedding rate for Salmonella was 9%, and no differences were observed in shedding rates or clinical parameters between probiotic-and placebo-treated groups. 81 Despite successful randomization in this study, there were limitations. The overall number of horses shedding Salmonella was small (n = 10). The numbers of horses that developed diarrhea, fever and leukopenia were not reported and neither was antimicrobial administration. These limitations could have greatly influenced the multivariate analysis performed in the study. Additionally, fecal samples were taken at irregular, arbitrary intervals, and given that Salmonella shedding can be intermittent, some cases might have been missed. 50, 72 Additionally, both studies used a commercial product that was not tested to assess the actual content claimed on the label.",

Inclusion criteria for cases cannot be determined from the provided information and the starting point of 'poor fecal consistency' as well as the endpoint 'improved' were not defined and were subjective. In 2 studies, 1 with healthy horses only and 1 with 'abnormal' horses, microbiological analysis was performed. An increase in the number of coliforms and a decrease in the number of Clostridium and Bacillus spp. in the treated horse were noted. Although this would indicate an effect of the probiotic on the microbiota of these horses, for the reasons described above, cultures have inherent technical limitations to assess the microbiota. It is unclear whether the changes that were noted actually represent beneficial effects on the intestinal microbiota. This is particularly true given recent studies that have indicated clostridia are important components of the intestinal microbiota, and decreases in this group actually may not be desirable. 4",
