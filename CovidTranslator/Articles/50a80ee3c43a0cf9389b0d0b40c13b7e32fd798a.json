Of the validation group, 60 patients (group A) were confirmed as having cases of SARS, and the other 172 (group B) patients tested negative for SARS. The total points of the scoring system for SARS at initial presentation were significantly higher in the SARS group (median 9; range 6 to 11) than in the non-SARS group (median 4; range 3 to 7; P<.001).

The history of exposure and associated symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, myalgia, diarrhea, and rigor were recorded. All patients were completely evaluated in isolated facilities at an emergency department (ED) within 3 hours and underwent CBC count (with a differential count), clotting profiles (prothrombin time, activated partial-thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio), and biochemical measurements. In addition, chest radiographs were obtained. Throat swab, sputum, or both were collected for Gram's stain and screening tests for common viruses, notably influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus. Legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigen testing were also examined. Final diagnosis of SARS was documented by the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan after polymerase chain reaction and paired serum for coronavirus antibody were measured. With positive polymerase chain reaction, positive paired serum, or both, the patients were confirmed as having SARS. Patients considered probable cases according to the WHO criteria were admitted, and the others were disposed to be isolated at home for 10 days. Convalescent serum was obtained during admission for the former patients and at 14 days at our clinics for the latter patients. Anyone who had clinical deterioration during home isolation was immediately transported back to the hospital by ambulance. The protocol was approved by our institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained.",

A patient with chest radiographic findings of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexplained respiratory disease resulting in death with autopsy results demonstrating the pathology comparable with SARS is considered a probable case. Although the WHO has provided the guidelines for SARS control and some diagnostic tools such as polymerase chain reaction, 6, 7, 9 indirect fluorescent antibody, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody are being developed, 9 there are still many clinical difficulties in diagnosing the disease quickly. For example, the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction is still uncertain, and the antibody titer may be detectable at the 10th to 21st day after the onset of SARS. 9 It is a difficult issue for emergency physicians to detect patients with SARS specifically if there is neither a reliable history of exposure nor a rapid diagnostic tool.",

Our report revealed that the WHO criteria for probable cases had only 44% specificity for patients who met the WHO criteria for suspected cases. This means there ought to be at least 2.3-fold reservation of isolated facilities and medical costs if all probable cases were admitted to hospitals. The average expenditure for each case to complete the workup for the scoring system for SARS was approximately US$200 in our series, whereas the medical cost during admission was US$1,100 per day. Although the total expenditure of completing the scoring system for SARS for our 232 validating patients was approximately US$46,400, the method saved at least 72 unnecessary admissions or US$1,108,800 (if the average duration of admission was 14 days). In addition, the rapid screening tests for common viruses and legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigen testing in our protocol were mainly for confirmation of the final diagnosis to establish the validity of the scoring system for SARS. Our primary objective was to develop a scoring system that used only common laboratory and radiographic examinations available at most EDs instead of other rapid tests. In other words, if no rapid screening tests were available, the scoring system still worked well.",
