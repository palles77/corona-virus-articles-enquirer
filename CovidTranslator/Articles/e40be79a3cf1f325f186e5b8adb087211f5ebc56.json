If an outbreak of a novel form of influenza occurs, a major worldwide pandemic is predicted because humans would not have immunity against this virus. To take effective countermeasures against new pandemics, investigation of past pandemics is essential.",

Spanish influenza was the largest pandemic, and Japan was seriously affected. Despite abundant public records related to Spanish influenza, few primary documents, such as medical records, remain in Japan. Recently, medical records from the early 20th century were found in the depository of the International Medical Center of Japan (IMCJ) Hospital, Tokyo. We used these records to investigate the clinical characteristics of Spanish influenza. To help prepare coun-termeasures, we investigated the outbreak situation, clinical findings, and outcomes of Spanish influenza in the Japanese military during 1918-1920.",

Cases diagnosed as pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and influenza were classified as respiratory infectious diseases. Although records of patients with tuberculosis were found, we excluded them from this study. In the 10-month period from January to October, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) monthly numbers of patients with pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and influenza were 10.9 \u00b1 6.5, 10.0 \u00b1 3.6, and 1.8 \u00b1 4.1, respectively (22.7 \u00b1 9.6 for all 3 illnesses).

The number of influenza patients suddenly increased to 109 in November, and 9 of them died (8%). Because our information about these 109 patients was found only in the hospitalization registries (the patients' medical records were not found), we could not identify their clinical symptoms. However, it can be assumed that the hospital experienced the first wave of Spanish influenza in November 1918.

These records covered 2 years (1919 and 1920), but most cases of clinical influenza were concentrated in May-November 1919. All 132 cases were in infantrymen 19-49 years of age (mean \u00b1 standard deviation 22.7 \u00b1 4.1 years); 47% had been farmers before entering the military, and 72% had no recorded medical histories. The initial symptom was sudden fever in 116 patients (94%), headache in 101 (81%), chills in 92 (74%), cough in 86 (69%), general malaise in 60 (48%), appetite loss in 56 (45%), pharyngalgia in 45 (36%), arthralgia/myalgia in 33 (27%), and vomiting/diarrhea in 27 (22%). On admission, reddish pharynx was noted in 105 (85%), coated tongue in 95 (77%), thoracic rale in 71 (57%), facial flush in 24 (19%), and conjunctival congestion in 16 (13%). The period from onset to admission was 4.7 \u00b1 3.9 days (range 0-24 days), the duration of hospitalization was 14.8 \u00b1 12.0 days (range 3-79 days), and the death rate was 6.0% (8/132). A comparison of 124 patients who survived and 8 who died is shown in the Table. In the patients who died, body temperature and pulse rate were higher at the time of hospital admission, and thoracic rale and an \"agonized facial expression\" (a painful expression as reported by Japanese doctors) were observed in many patients. The death rate was higher in patients who had digestive symptoms, but the difference was not statistically significant. In fatal cases, the patients died an average of 13.9 days after symptom onset and 7.1 days after admission.",

The nucleotide sequences of these genes have been determined, and the viral characteristics have been reported (7, 8) . However, the only method that can clarify the pathophysiology of Spanish influenza is investigation of the medical records at the time of the pandemic. Thus, the discovery of medical records and hospitalization registries of the Spanish influenza pandemic is useful. Although we studied only patients in Japan, studying patients in the Japanese Army Garrison hospital in Russia may provide a clue to the conditions of the influenza outbreak in that region. Many theories exist as to the source of Spanish influenza, but the first reported case in the United States likely occurred in March 1918 (3) . After that, it spread worldwide through 1920. Of the 1.8-2.0 billion persons in the world at that time, 600 million were affected and 20-40 million died from this disease (9) . In Japan, 23 million persons were affected, and 390,000 died. The first wave occurred in Japan in August 1918, and many cases were reported in Tokyo in mid-October (10, 11) . Hospitalization registries of the Tokyo First Army Hospital showed a sudden increase in admissions for influenza in November 1918; this outbreak may have been the beginning of the Spanish influenza pandemic in Japan.",

Initial symptoms were fever, headache, chills, and cough, and their frequency was not different from those of patients with seasonal or ordinary influenza.

The mean age of the population investigated was 22.7 years. Persons 20-30 years of age had the highest death rate and this may have been the reason for the overall higher death rate. The cause of a high death rate in young persons is unclear, but it may have been related to poor immunity because they had not previously been exposed to influenza virus.
