Inactivation procedures with Triton X-100 0.1% and/or heat are currently recommended, but have unknown effects on the accuracy of serological testing. Furthermore, virus inactivation by Triton X-100 0.1% was shown to be ineffective in serum. This study aimed to demonstrate virus inactivation in serum by Triton X-100 1% and maintained accuracy of serological testing. Methods: A panel of 19 serological tests was run on patient serum samples after treatment with Triton X-100 1%, 0.1%, and 0.1% \u00fe heat inactivation at 60 C for 1 h. Mean differences between measurements (bias) were calculated applying the BlandeAltman method. To determine effectiveness of virus inactivation, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) was spiked into medium containing 90% or 1% serum, and treated with Triton X-100 0.1% or 1%. Infectious titres were then determined on Vero cells. Results: Serological measurements showed good agreement between controls and samples treated with Triton X-100 0.1% and 1%, with an estimated bias of 0.6 \u00b1 9.2% (n \u00bc 258) and e0.1 \u00b1 18.6% (n \u00bc 174), respectively. Discordant qualitative results were rare. Conversely, heat inactivation alone and combined with Triton X-100 0.1% triggered a bias of 17.5 \u00b1 66.4% (n \u00bc 200) and 37.9 \u00b1 79.8% (n \u00bc 160), respectively. Triton X-100 1% completely inactivated HSV-1 in 1% and 90% serum while Triton X-100 0.1% failed to do so in 90% serum. Conclusions: Unlike heat inactivation, Triton X-100 1% enabled accurate serological testing and completely inactivated HSV-1 in serum. This simple method could allow safe routine serological diagnostics in high-risk patients. M.M. Remy, Clin Microbiol Infect 2019;25:907.e7e907.e12",

Triton X-100 is a non-ionic surfactant which can disrupt the lipid membrane of enveloped viruses without affecting proteins. It is therefore widely used in combination with tri-(N-butyl)-phosphate (TnBP) for solventedetergent inactivation procedures of plasma products for transfusion [6] . Besides, Triton X-100 0.1% has been successfully evaluated for haematology and clinical chemistry [7e10] and for malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) [11, 12] . Accuracy of immunoassays after Triton X-100 treatment of serum was only partially assessed in 1988 and no decrease in sensitivity was reported [13] .",

Concerning detergents, complete inactivation of HIV was achieved with 0.2% of Triton X-100 [13] whereas EBOV treatment with 0.1% of Triton X-100 led to incomplete inactivation with a 4 log infectivity reduction [22] . Besides, it has been recently claimed that the inactivation potential of Triton X-100 0.1% was annulled in serum [10] . Inactivation tests were indeed performed on EBOV and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in 0.98%, 9.8%, or 98% serum, and viral inactivation by Triton X-100 only succeeded in medium with less than 10% serum, suggesting that some factors in serum interfere with detergent effects. In practice, Triton X-100 concentration is often increased to 1% to ensure a higher level of safety although no inactivation data support this choice. It thus remains to be determined if a higher concentration of Triton X-100 can overcome efficiency issues in serum.",

Qualitative results were assessed for each sample and a false result rate (FRR) was calculated by computing false-negative and falsepositive results compared with controls for each test.

This remains, however, to be tested especially for EBOV, which is a rather stable virus [2, 3] . Preliminary results of EBOV inactivation with Triton X-100 1% for 20 min are promising [27] . Other proven inactivation methods such as the combination of Triton X-100 and heat against EBOV [2, 14, 28] are unfortunately not compatible with serological diagnosis and should be limited to molecular diagnosis. Moreover, although this combination allowed detection of EBOV-specific IgG and IgM [14] , our study suggests that inactivation procedures used for EBOV serology should be further evaluated and compared to inactivation with Triton X-100 alone.",

The initial step of adding detergent to the serum sample does however require trained personnel, rigorous safety practices, and a biosafety cabinet of level 2. Triton X-100 has a long history of usage in diagnostic procedures; nevertheless, it is unknown if high concentrations of detergent could potentially affect routine laboratory analysers. Another limitation to the broad usage of Triton X-100 consists in environmental concerns. This reagent will soon be forbidden in Europe because of its endocrine disruption effects in aquatic organisms [29] . Restricted usage for well-defined procedures and appropriate waste treatment solutions will most probably still be possible in future. Ecofriendly alternatives such as lauryldimethylamine N-oxide (LDAO) [30] have been shown to exhibit effective virus inactivation in a broad range of protein concentrations but need further evaluation with different viruses and conditions.

Influence of serum concentration on the chemical inactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Reduction in HSV-1 titres in samples containing either 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 90% human serum after treatment with 0.1% or 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Controls received an equivalent amount of PBS. Before titration, samples were filtrated through 100-kDa membranes to remove residual Triton X-100. Unfiltered PBS controls are shown to account for eventual virus loss through the filter. TCID 50 /ml titres presented as mean \u00b1 SD were determined in three independent experiments with 4-8 replicates per experiment.
