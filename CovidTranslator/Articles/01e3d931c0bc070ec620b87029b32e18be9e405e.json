Experience with the 2001 anthrax attack and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic suggest that there is limited willingness to accept such drugs and that minority groups may respond differently from others. We conducted 148 intercept interviews in the metropolitan Washington, DC, area, examining 2 hypothetical scenarios: a new respiratory virus and public exposure to high levels of radiation. Findings provide insights into key factors that affect whether diverse members of the public comply with recommended protective actions like taking emergency authorized vaccines. These insights can help improve how public health practitioners communicate during uncertain times.",

It may be possible to encourage more people to adhere to recommended protective behaviors by ensuring that messages cover areas that members of the public wish to hear about, that the messages are communicated by trusted spokespeople through widely accessed sources, and that trust in the lead organizations is promoted and maintained. 13 Crisis and emergency risk communication differs from standard risk communication in that a decision is made within narrow time constraints, the decision may be irreversible, the outcome may be uncertain, and the decision may be made based on incomplete information. 14 The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2001 anthrax attacks, and other CBRN threats have illustrated the challenges of communication in emergency situations, including high uncertainty, nearly impossible time constraints, and high public anxiety. 15,16 Indeed, evidence from the 2001 anthrax attacks suggests that inadequate crisis and emergency risk communication can reduce trust and credibility. 17 Successful communication begins with accurate information delivered in a timely, empathetic, and open way. This establishes trust in a message source and the credibility of a message. 14 In 2011, the office of the Associate Director for Communication at CDC convened a national panel to define and identify best practices for crisis and emergency risk communication: explain what is known at the time about an event's impact on human health; explain what is not known about the threat to human health; explain how or",

Those efforts have included policy changes that enable the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to quickly evaluate and authorize such medical countermeasures in a declared public health emergency and to communicate this approval, along with partner public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In a nationwide Harris Poll of 2,232 US adults surveyed between January 14 and 20, 2015, 92% understood the FDA's roles and responsibilities. 6 Of that 92%, 57% of adults rated the FDA as doing an ''excellent/pretty good'' job, while the remaining 43% rated the FDA as doing an ''only fair/poor'' job. According to the Harris Poll, the trend in the FDA's positive ratings decreased by 5% since the first year of the study in 2000, but an overall 3% increase occurred between 2009 and 2015. This overall increase in positive FDA ratings is supported by other similar surveys. 7 Additionally, critics disagree about whether the FDA is too risky or too risk-averse when making drug approval decisions. 8 In a more recent poll that specifically measured public opinions on the FDA's role in the safe and timely approval of new medical treatments, nearly 6 out of 10 Americans opposed changing safety standards to allow for faster approval of new prescription drugs and medical devices, while roughly 40% favored speedier FDA action. 9 These results provide information on how the public balances their priorities between speed and safety in the approval of new medical treatments. In the context of an emergency, it may suggest greater public concern about EUAs and medical countermeasures. Therefore, in an emergency, in which the FDA would work closely with the CDC and other agencies on decisions and communications about necessary countermeasures, communication with the public will need to clearly articulate the risks and benefits associated with proposed EUAs and medical countermeasures.",

Focusing on the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Quinn and colleagues were the first to examine public acceptance of taking a vaccine or drug under an EUA. 10 Results showed that 63.5% of 1,469 respondents would not accept a new vaccine that had not been approved through the standard process. There was greater willingness to accept Tamiflu, which was an approved drug authorized under EUA for unapproved uses, with 54% indicating willingness to take the drug. In both cases, African Americans were least likely to accept the medical countermeasure. Quinn et al also examined public acceptance of an unapproved EUA drug, Peramivir, an antiviral drug used to treat influenza, in a hypothetical medical crisis situation, finding that 48% of 2,042 respondents indicated that they would probably or definitely take the drug. 11 Needing more information and the use of the term experimental were impediments to acceptance for all groups. An important conclusion from these 2 studies is that trust in the FDA is important for EUA acceptance and that particular care must be taken to ensure that patients and their families receive adequate and understandable information about the medical countermeasure.",

The Pew Research Center released a comprehensive report in 2015 stating that fewer than 3 in 10 Americans have expressed trust in the federal government in every major national poll conducted since July 2007-the longest period of low trust in government in more than 50 years. 22 In a crisis, the degree to which one trusts the source of an emergency recommendation significantly affects compliance. 23 For example, trust in government agencies was found to be a powerful predictor of vaccine intention and compliance, which could be translated to the context of EUA acceptance in a crisis situation. 16, 24, 25 Additionally, uncertainty, concerns about equity, agency disagreements, and mixed messaging can diminish trust in public health agencies. 26 The more that people trust their government or the communicating official, the better they are able to handle fear in uncertain situations. 27 Most important, the willingness of a member of the public to engage in preventive or emergency behaviors depends on the risk communicator's preexisting organizational reputation, people's past and present relationship experience with the communicating organization, and the credibility of the organization's advice. 25 Without trust, communicating uncertainty in a crisis situation becomes almost impossible.",

This may be because the uncertainty communication literature in relation to crises is sparse. Lachlan and colleagues define uncertainty as ''an inherently uncomfortable state, and information seeking is a common cognitive strategy when that uncertainty is directly related to a perceived threat.'' 27(p39) Uncertainty arises throughout public health emergencies including: who or what caused the emergency; how many lives have been lost and the extent of infrastructure damage; what members of the public can do to protect themselves; and when the emergency will be over. 28 Available research has identified a relationship between public trust levels in emergency information sources and the level of crisis uncertainty experienced, but with so much variation existing among crises, it is difficult to know how to effectively communicate crisisrelated uncertainties to the public. 6, 27, 29 When public health agencies disagree on recommendations, as was the case in the 2001 anthrax attacks, uncertainty and conflicting opinions can create even more confusion. To mitigate this uncertainty about conflicting government guidance, having an open forum can foster trust and enhance people's abilities to make informed decisions, ultimately reducing uncertainty. 17 Additionally, by directly addressing uncertainty early in a crisis, the government may be able to influence the public's acceptance of future changes in understanding and behavioral recommendations. 16 These kinds of situational updates can help ensure effective communication-all while maintaining credibility in public health agencies. 30 ",

As single-item measures do not lend themselves to traditional reliability measures, the instrument was evaluated by several public health experts external to the project's data collection for face validity.

A sample openended question reads, ''What remaining questions do you have regarding this information?''

Prior research also found that participants were somewhat likely to accept a vaccine or drug under EUA. 6 However, findings here about a multi-modal distribution indicate that additional persuasive communication likely is needed during an emergency beyond the initial factsheet to those who are completely noncompliant. Future research is needed to determine what factors may motivate people from noncompliance to compliance. It may be possible to encourage compliance through ensuring that messages cover topics of most interest to members of the public. 13 This study found that those topics include more information about the countermeasures (eg, side effects, medicine testing, approval process) and the emergency itself (eg, cause of the outbreak, when did the emergency begin, is the emergency real). Some participants also wanted more information about disease transmission. Others wanted more information about how emergency information is transmitted. We were surprised that we found no significant difference in perceived risk of the 2 hazards-an infectious disease and a radiation exposure.

Prior research linked high public anxiety to crisis and emergency risk communication. 15, 16 This study emphasizes just how strong the public's negative emotions are when it comes to risk communication about medical countermeasures. However, it is unclear whether the negativity found in this study is about the countermeasure itself, the public health emergency, the underlying risks the countermeasure seeks to address, or the government itself. This high negativity presents significant challenges for FDA communication about medical countermeasures, suggesting that any campaign will need to be more extensive and require more exposures in order to foster positive attitudes toward the medical counter-measure and its adoption.

From this finding several conclusions can be drawn. First, if a single untailored message is used to communicate about medical countermeasures, messages likely should avoid fear appeals. Second, future research could identify what makes medical countermeasure messages persuasive to different target audiences. Here we found that the 2 least persuasive factors, and thus the worst predictors of compliance, were government trust and information clarity. Recall that trust, when treated as a dependent variable, was predicted by racial/ethnic identity. However, when trust is an independent predictor of positive behavioral outcomes, the relationship becomes even more complex. From this finding we can deduce that medical countermeasure messages cannot rely on government agencies' credibility or public trust, as extensively argued in prior research. 13, 14, 16, 17, 24, 25 These messages also are unlikely to be persuasive if they rely on a clear argument that the medical countermeasure is necessary for public health to motivate compliance. Additional research is needed to identify what discrete message characteristics are most persuasive for motivating public compliance for medical countermeasures. Here we only tested persuasiveness as a global construct and found it was the strongest predictor of compliance.",

It is possible that these findings are related to a socially desirable response effect. People in relatively powerless positions, like minorities or economically repressed individuals, learn and use an adaptive strategy of agreeing with statements in order to maintain a ''good face'' and avoid psychological distress. 40 Socially desirable responses have been long investigated, 41 with recent work noting the common nature of the effect in various powerless groups. 42 Further research is needed to explore whether the differences found here are real differences or differences caused by a socially desirable response effect. Furthermore, future research should explore what other factors might affect how diverse audiences respond to medical countermeasure communication, including economic status and employment.",
