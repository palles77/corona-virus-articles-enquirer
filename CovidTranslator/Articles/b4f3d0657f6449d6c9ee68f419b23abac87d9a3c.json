Because of overcrowding in the emergency department on that day, he remained there for 27 min, without there being any suspicion of MERS, and was then, upon his own request and after cancelling his hospital registration, moved to another hospital, where he was identified as the sixth confirmed MERS case in South Korea on 28",

On 28 May 2015, we received a report from the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that this index patient was positive for RT-PCR for MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). At that point, we were concerned about possible nosocomial transmission from the patient. An epidemiological investigation of all HCWs who had been in contact with the patient was immediately initiated via emergency department security closed circuit television to identify all HCWs who had been in contact with the index patient. We identified a total of 31 HCWs in the emergency department during his 27-min stay. Of these 31 HCWs, nine were classified as having been within 3-6 feet of the patient. These nine HCWs were quarantined at home and monitored for 14 days. If fever or respiratory symptoms developed, RT-PCR for MERS was immediately performed by the KCDC. One individual became symptomatic. Sera were collected from the other eight HCWs approximately 3 weeks after their exposure to the index patient. Serum from the symptomatic HCW, who was finally diagnosed with MERS by RT-PCR performed in the KCDC, was collected approximately 6 weeks after his exposure to the index patient upon his recovery from MERS.",

            "text": "The KCDC guidelines define close contact as being within approximately 6 feet of the patient, or within the room or care area, 'for a long time' [2] . However, this time definition is somewhat vague. Actually, the initial KCDC MERS control guidelines described close contact as staying within 6 feet of the patient for >1 h [5] . This time period of 1 h is rather arbitrary, but the government released this figure for practical reasons. However, data on the minimal requirements for defining close contact and length of contact are limited. We show that a 10min stay and 2 min of talking within 3-6 feet of a severely ill patient with MERS is enough for the transmission of MERS-CoV. We assume that the initial idea that a 'relatively long time period' was required for the transmission of MERS-CoV, which guided the initial investigation of close contacts of the first case imported into South Korea, may have been responsible for the initial failure of contact-tracing in the KCDC response. Our data for the minimal duration of contact with HCWs for the transmission of MERS-CoV will be important for developing guidelines describing more specific behaviours and times for the definition of close contact. Some argue that the security guard who acquired MERS-CoV could have been infected from some other unknown source. A relatively long incubation period (13 days) may increase this possibility. However, he did not work on 28 May, owing to being off-duty, and he was quarantined at home from 29 May, and so had no opportunity for contact with other sources. Actually, two patients experienced transmission from the index patient (sixth confirmed patient); one is the security guard in our hospital and the other is a family member [3] . This family member also had the same incubation period (13 days). This suggests that low viral shedding from the index patient might result in a long incubation period.",
