Employing cystic fibrosis respiratory epithelial cells, here we show that drugs AZT and ciprofloxacin (CPX) act as acidotropic lipophilic weak bases and confer in vitro effects on intracellular organelles similar to the effects of CQ. These seemingly disparate FDA-approved antimicrobials display a common property of modulating pH of endosomes and trans-Golgi network. We believe this may in part help understand the potentially beneficial effects of CQ/HCQ and AZT in COVID-19, and that the present considerations of HCQ and AZT for clinical trials should be extended to CPX.",

            "text": "The novel SARS-CoV-like virus, 2019-nCoV (CoV2), related to SARS-CoV but distinct form it, was identified as the causative agent of the current, 2019-2020 outbreak of viral pneumonia that started in Wuhan, China, which spread to all permanently inhabited continents. The human-to-human spread of CoV2 has resulted in a runaway global pandemic, causing a disease termed COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 pandemics is escalating at an alarming rate with 649,904 infected, as of this writing, and 15,835 deaths just in Italy and Spain with a combined 9.6% mortality rate in these disproportionately affected countries away from the epicenter of the initial epidemic 6,7 . COVID-19 threatens worldwide populations based on its pernicious combination of long incubation times coupled with exceptional spreading potential, and significantly high morbidity and mortality. The reproductive number R0 initially estimated to be 2.2-2.7 8, 9 according to some estimates may possibly reach 4.7-6.6 10 . There is an urgent public health need to understand CoV2 as a virus, COVID-19 as a disease, and COVID-19 as a frightening epidemiological phenomenon. The world is literally scrambling to develop countermeasures, including therapeutics aiming to lessen disease severity and to come up with prophylaxes including vaccines. Recently, two FDA approved drugs, chloroquine (CQ) and azithromycin (AZT), have shown therapeutic effects in in COVID-19, using viral loads as endpoints in compassionate use/initial clinical trials associated with life-threatening pulmonary complications 11 . This work began at the time when a major progress has been made in understanding the key properties of the anomalous ion conductances across cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory epithelia, with defects in chloride transport via the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR, and in sodium transport via the epithelial sodium channel ENaC 12 . Certain drugs have proven useful in treating pulmonary disease in CF, such as AZT, an antibiotic that has been a staple of clinical management of CF 13, 14 . CF patients treated with AZT benefit 14 in several aspects of lung function, have decreased rate of exacerbations, and experience improved quality of life [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , albeit the magnitude of these benefits may vary 20 . As an antibiotic, the mechanism of AZT in CF might be expected to be killing of bacteria, yet the tissue levels of this macrolide do not reach the necessary anti-pseudomonal concentrations in the lungs to provide an easy explanation for its benefits. Whereas several studies propose effects of AZT on bacterial biofilms 21 , there is compelling evidence that host-mediated effects of this macrolide are just as important since: (i) AZT has beneficial effects in CF, even before 19 Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization 22 occurs; and (ii) AZT protects the bronchial epithelium during P. aeruginosa infection independently of its antimicrobial activity 23 . Thus, AZT confers a previously undefined and antibioticindependent benefit that is both documented in CF clinical trials [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] and routinely observed in CF management. However, a subsequent study provided a cautionary note for prolonged AZT's use in CF since it, like chloroquine, inhibits autophagy 24 , which is involved in control of mycobacteria 25 .",

We tested the effects of AZT on CF respiratory epithelial cells in the absence of bacteria or microbial innate immunity agonists. Among the tests employed, we examine the pH of intracellular organelles since prior studies [27] [28] [29] [32] [33] [34] [35] have indicated that these organelles display subtly increased acidification in CF respiratory epithelial cells. Of further relevance, unlike most other macrolides that show little benefit in CF 14 , AZT possesses two weak base functional groups with pKa of 8.2 and 8.6 (Fig. 1A) . The pH of the lumen of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and recycling endosomes (RE) in CF lung cells were measured by ratiometrically applying an intracellular pH-sensitive probe, pHlourin GFP 36 . The pH sensitive GFP was fused to TGN38 or cellubrevin thus localizing the pHluorin GFP to the lumen of the TGN or RE 36 in CF respiratory epithelial cells 35 34 . Primary CF bronchial epithelial cells treated with AZT displayed correction of the previously reported TGN and RE hyperacidifcation [27] [28] [29] [32] [33] [34] [35] (Fig. B-G) . Treatment of IB3-1 (CF cells) with either 100 \u00b5M (for 1 h) or 1 \u00b5M AZT (for 48 h), led to a correction of TGN pH from 6.2 \u00b1 0.1 (control) to 7.1 \u00b1 0.1 or to 6.7 \u00b1 0.2 ( Fig. 1C) , comparable to the pH of 6.7 \u00b1 0.1 within the TGN of S9 cells (CFTR-corrected IB3-1 cells). In primary CF bronchial epithelial cells (Fig 1D) , AZT treatment corrected their TGN pH from 6.1 \u00b1 0.2 to 6.7 \u00b1 0.1 (Fig 1D) . Of note is that the absolute concentration of AZT was not critical for the effect at equilibrium, as expected from the extracellular sink of an acidotropic agent accumulating in acidified compartments by being protonated and trapped within the organellar lumen.",

Based on our findings that AZT corrects acidification of TGN in CF cells, we investigated whether AZT affected the undersialylation of aGM1 and reduced bacterial adherence to CF lung epithelial cells. It has been proposed that undersialylation and reduced binding of cholera toxin was one of the evolutionary drivers for the emergence of CFTR mutations in human populations, and that this can be explained at least in part by hyperacidification of the TGN and the resulting suboptimal distribution or activity of sialyltransferases and other glycosylating enzymes in this organelle 29, 39 . CF and normal cells were grown for 14 days postconfluency, followed by 48 h treatment of the monolayers with 1-100 \u00b5M AZT. The monolayers were assayed for binding of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) conjugated to fluorophore FITC (CTB binds preferentially to sialylated glycoconjugates) (Fig.  3A ). Using binding of CTB to S9 cells (CFTR-corrected IB3-1 cells) as 100%, and binding to IB3-1 cells (CF) as 0%, treatment of IB3-1 monolayers with 1-100 \u00b5M AZT increased CTB-FITC binding to levels that approached that of the non-CF S9 cells (Fig. 3A) . As with the TGN-38 pH correction, the effect of AZT on the correction of CTB binding was concentration independent, as expected from accumulation of an acidotropic agent and its intraorganellar trapping once it is protonated.",

We tested the effect of AZT on IL-8 release under basal conditions and upon stimulation with P. aeruginosa DNA. Treatment of CF-cells with 1 to 100 \u00b5M AZT reduced basal IL-8 secretion by almost 70 % (Fig. 3E) . Stimulation of IL-8 production by addition of P. aeruginosa DNA led to a 5-fold increase of IL-8 secretion (unstimulated = 55 pg IL-8 / 100 \u00b5g protein vs. DNA stimulated = 240 pg IL-8 / 100 \u00b5g protein).

As with the other assays, concentration of AZT in the medium was not critical to obtain effects although longer pre-incubation times (e.g. 24-48 h for 1 \u00b5M AZT vs. 1-4 h for 100 \u00b5M AZT) were needed at lower concentrations. It is important to note that this behavior is in support of the AZT action as a weak base that accumulates in acidified intracellular organelles, which act as a sink for trapping AZT upon its protonation. In addition, the effect of AZT on basal RANTES levels 45 was measured and AZT reduced RANTES secretion (Fig. 3G) .",

We have reported that TGF-\u03b2 generated by CF respiratory epithelial cells is increased compared to normal cells and that treatment with the weak base CQ can correct TGF-\u03b2 release 27, 33 . When AZT was tested, it too reduced TGF-\u03b2 (Fig. 4A) . We have reported that the elevated TGF-\u03b2 in CF cells is caused by increased furin activity in the intracellular organelles of CF respiratory epithelial cells 27 . Hence, we tested whether AZT affected the furin inbalance. When CF cells were incubated with 100 \u00b5M AZT, production of active furin was normalized in CF cells, on par with CQ treatment and on level with the CFTR-corrected S9 cells (Fig. 4B) . These results indicate that correcting organellar pH with AZT normalizes the excessive processing and activation of furin in CF cells. In summary, AZT benefits in CF that cannot be explained by its direct antibiotic activity are due to its physical-chemical action as a weak base, normalizing organellar function and cell-autonomous responses of CF respiratory epithelial cells.",

Furthermore, our previous studies of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitiors show similar effects, and these may also be further tested. 30 The alterations of pH in organelles of the secretory pathway, especially TGN 31 , may alter glycosylation of both the receptors for CoV2, such as ACE2, which binds the spike protein, and glycosylation of CoV2 proteins during their biogenesis and assembly. Importantly, coronavirus M proteins govern viral budding at the ERto-Golgi intermediate compartment but penetrate deeper into the Golgi apparatus 54 , and among the pathogenic CoVs, at least the MERS CoV M protein possesses TGN localization signals 55 . The effects of chloroquine have been observed with other viruses including HIV gp120 glycosylation defect and loss of infectivity 56, 57 as well as HSV arrest of noninfectious parties in the TGN 58 . Our studies here show that CF respiratory epithelial cell normalization is based on a neutralization of the pre-existing pathologically hyperacidified compartments due to the underlying CF disease, resulting in normalization of glycosylation in CF respiratory epithelial cells. We postulate here that the acidotropic and neutralization effects of AZT, CPX and CQ in normal cells would result in vectorially similar pH shifts away from optimal for the function of enzymes within the secretory pathway that would also alter glycosylation.",

            "text": "The alterations of pH in organelles of the endosomal pathway may have effects on host proteases acting upon the CoV2 Spike protein to execute its cleavage necessary for virus entry. The inhibition of viral entry in recent cellular systems is best achieved with a combination of camostat mesylate (an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease) plus E-64d, an inhibitor of lysosomal cathepsins 59 . It has been noted that CoV2, unlike SARS-CoV, possesses a novel furin cleavage site within its Spike protein 60 . Our studies here show that AZT can reduce furin activity that is abundantly present in respiratory epithelial cells. Multiple proteases are proposed to cleave CoV2 Spike, including TMPRSS2 59 (which also acts on SARS-CoV 61-63 ), furin 60 , and lysosomal hydrolases 59 . This warrants consideration of a more general approach to their inhibition, such as altering pH, rather than focusing solely on a specific host protease. We propose that the drugs studied here, CQ, AZT and CPX, may modulate these aspects of host-pathogen interactions and virus infectious cycle, with immediate compassionate use in the clinic or in controlled clinical trials. A validation of the effects of CPX in COVID-19 patients would enable the utilization of this drug to alleviate likely shortages in HCQ and AZT. CPX is a part of the US Health and Human Services Strategic National Stockpile 64 , which can be mobilized during regional or national emergencies.",
