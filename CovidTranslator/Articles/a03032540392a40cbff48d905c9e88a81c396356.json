Diagnosis of farm animals and laboratory animals is useful for early isolation of the infected individuals and prevention of the spread of infection. Immune-based tests have long been the principal means of diagnosis of these infectious diseases. On the other hand, the demand for genetic diagnosis has risen because of its high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility [1] [2] [3] . Genetic analysis methods include real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 1 PCR sequence, TaqMan PCR, invader assay, PCR restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP), allele-specific primer (ASP) PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and DNA chip-based technology.",

This technology can be used for gene expression monitoring, mutation, polymorphism, and phenotypic analysis and has become an indispensable tool in biology, biotechnology, and drug discovery [6] . However, because general fluorescence-based DNA chip methods require expensive devices and involve complicated operations, their use is largely limited to research. With regard to infectious diseases, the ability to test many samples for several genes would be advantageous. As for a general DNA chip, because one chip corresponds to one sample, it is unsuitable for multisample processing. To analyze multiple samples simultaneously, a DNA chip that physically separates a reactive part has been reported [7, 8] . But there are disadvantages in that large-scale device remodeling is necessary and the chip becomes more expensive owing to its larger size.",

The principle of the electrochemical DNA chip has been described previously [11] . This method is simple and inexpensive because it requires no labeling step and large and expensive equipment is unnecessary. Therefore, it is suitable for genetic diagnostics. Moreover, in exploiting an advantage of this method, namely that it is easy to develop an automatic system, we have developed a miniature system, Genelyzer, that can be used at the bedside and for on-the-spot examination [12] . In this study, a multisample detection system that combines this electrochemical DNA chip and tag insertion primer was developed mainly for diagnosis of infectious diseases. A feature of this method is the use of a tag for sample identification. In the first application, a screening chip for the detection of Helicobacter species that are the most common contaminants in laboratory rodents was developed [11] .",

The standard plasmids were used for determination of the detecting condition of this method. Genomic DNAs were extracted from 150 cecal samples of mice. The method for DNA extraction from the cecum by phenol/chloroform and isoamylic alcohol (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) consisted of the addition to each sample of 1 ml of lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 65 lg proteinase K/ml, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate), followed by incubation in a water bath at 50\u00b0C overnight. Subsequently, the lysate was washed with a mixture of phenol/chloroform and isoamylic alcohol (25:24:1), and the supernatant aqueous phase was recovered by a final washing using chloroform (Nakalai Tesque). Absolute ethanol (Junsei Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) was added to the solution, which was then centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000g. The precipitated DNA was washed with 75% ethanol, and DNA was resuspended in 300 ll of TE buffer (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan).

This figure assumes the case where the target nucleic acid, such as bacteria and the virus to be detected, exists in sample 1 and 3 but does not exist in sample 2. First, the primers that insert a different tag sequence in each sample are prepared. Second, the amplification reactions are performed independently in each sample using these primers. In samples 1 and 3, when the tag insertion primer binds to the target nucleic acid, the tag part causes the loop out and the amplification reaction can proceed. Then amplification products in which a part of the sequence is different in each sample can be obtained. The F2 region, between the F2 and F1 regions (F2-F1), the B2 region, and between the B2 and B1 regions (B2-B1) of the LAMP products are partially single-stranded loop [15] . Therefore, when the tag part is inserted into the F2 or B2 region of the LAMP primer, the tag part is introduced into the singlestranded loop portion of the amplification product. Finally, the target sample in which the amplification products from each sample are mixed is detected by the DNA chip. The target sequence that hybridized with the probe is designed to include both the tag part and the F2-F1 or B2-B1 region.",

As shown in Fig. 2 , the tag was inserted 3, 6, and 9 bases from the 3 0 end of the F2 region, and the tag numbers 2, 3, and 4 were exam- ined. Two kinds of tag sequence were prepared for each design, and 1000 copies/reaction of the Hh and Hp plasmids were used. As shown in Table 1 , amplification reaction could be conducted for all primers inserted into the 9 bases from the 3 0 end of the F2 region. For primers inserted into 6 bases from the 3 0 end, tag numbers 3 and 4 showed unstable amplification, although tag number 2 showed amplification. For primers inserted into 3 bases from the 3 0 end, all primers showed unstable amplification. Second, the sensitivity of the tag insertion primers was evaluated. The primers that inserted five tags (1.CTG, 2.GGA, 3.CCT, 4.TCC, and 5.ATC) into 9 bases from the 3 0 end of the F2 region and the primer without tag insertion were prepared, and 10, 100, and 1000 copies/reaction of Hh, Hb, Ht, Hp, and Hm plasmids were used. As a result, amplification was confirmed for all primers and all 1000 copies/reaction plasmids. For 10 and 100 copies/reaction plasmids, all primers showed unstable amplification. The sensitivity of the five tag primers was almost the same as that of the primer without tag insertion. In addition, primers that inserted tag numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 into 9 bases from the 3 0 end were examined using 1000 copies/ reaction of Hh and Hp plasmids, and tag numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8 (all except 9) could be amplified. Primers that inserted tag number 3 into 7 and 8 bases from the 3 0 end were also examined using 1000 copies/reaction of Hh and Hp plasmids, and both primers could be amplified. These results indicated that the tag introduc- (F1c + F2) , BIP (B1c + B2), F3, and B3. In addition, the amplification period can be shortened by optionally using a primer called a loop primer, LPc. FIP primer hybridizes to F2c in the target nucleic acid and initiates complementary strand synthesis, and then F3 primer hybridizes to F3c in the target nucleic acid and initiates strand displacement DNA synthesis, releasing an FIP-linked complementary strand. When F1c and F1 that exist in the FIP-linked complementary strand bind, the F2 region and F2-F1 region become a single-stranded loop. Similarly, the B2 region and B2-B1 region become a single-stranded loop. In this multisample detection DNA chip, first, the primers that insert a different tag sequence in each sample are prepared. Second, the amplification reactions are performed independently in each sample using these primers. In samples 1 and 3 where the target nucleic acid exists, when the tag insertion primer binds to the target nucleic acid, the tag part causes the loop out and the amplification reaction can proceed. Then amplification products in which a part of the sequence was different in each sample can be obtained. Finally, the target sample in which the amplification products from each sample are mixed is detected by the DNA chip. tion products can be obtained by optimizing the tag insertion position and tag number.",

Simultaneous detection of more samples will become possible by increasing the kinds of tag sequence and optimization of tag insertion position and tag number. The advantages of this method are as follows. First, the cost per sample can be drastically lowered through multisample detection by one DNA chip. Second, this method does not require any configuration change for the equipment and the DNA chip. Third, there is no false-positive detection by the nonspecific reaction of primers that sometimes occurs in LAMP reaction. Fourth, genotyping and species identification can be analyzed according to the application. The target sequence selected for this study was a common region between Helicobacter species for screening use. There is a relatively specific region between each species in the vicinity of this target sequence (Fig. 2) . So, if this specific region is set as a target sequence, nearly every species can be identified. Moreover, with the expansion of this method, two or more target nucleic acids can be detected simultaneously by multiplex amplification. We are now developing the DNA chip for multisample detection that identifies several infectious canine diseases such as parvovirus, distemper virus, and enteric coronavirus. In addition, with a view to eventually offering a lineup of automatic systems, we have developed a roll-type system that detects 24 cassettes by automatic operation and a fully automatic system that includes the nucleic acid extraction and amplification. The roll-type system was developed for examination centers and has given satisfactory results with this developed Helicobacter detection DNA chip. The combined technology of the electrochemical DNA chip for multisample detection and the automatic systems is expected to contribute to infectious disease diagnosis in the near future.",
