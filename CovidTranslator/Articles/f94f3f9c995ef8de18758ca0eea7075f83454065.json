Methods: Online pandemic plans from national, provincial and territorial government websites were reviewed to identify: plans for children and families, and psychosocial and ethical issues. A survey was administered to gather participants' perspectives on the needs in pediatric planning, as well as important elements of their organizations' and regions' pandemic plans. A thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative survey responses. Results: The majority of existing plans did not adequately address the unique needs of pediatric populations, and mainly focused on medical and policy concerns. Several gaps in plans were identified, including the need for psychosocial supports and ethical decision-making frameworks for children and families. Similarly, survey respondents identified parallel gaps, in their organization's or region's plans. Conclusions: Although many plans provide guidelines for medical and policy issues in pediatrics, much more work remains in psychosocial and ethical planning. A focus on children and families is needed for pandemic planning in pediatrics to ensure best outcomes for children and families.",

            "text": "The impact of pandemic H1N1 (2009) has raised public awareness of the threat of a severe influenza outbreak, as the Public Health Agency of Canada, provincial, and territorial bodies continue to bolster their contingency plans. In 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) revealed gaps in Ontario's emergency response capability, and highlighted the need to prepare for future epidemics. The effects of this outbreak resulted in a total of 251 probable cases and 43 deaths in Canada [1] . SARS heavily impacted the health care system in Ontario and in affected areas across the globe. Recent memories of this outbreak, coupled with the threat of pandemic H1N1 (2009) warn of the impacts of a major outbreak in Canada. Accordingly, planning has become a pressing issue for stakeholders in government, industry and community. While the exact timing, pattern and impact of a future pandemic is unknown [2, 3] , in Canada an influenza pandemic could result in as many as 10.6 million people (35%) who become clinically ill, 138,000 (0.5%) who require hospitalization, and up to 58,000 deaths (0.2%) [4] . Such concerns have become a high profile public health issue, and fears of a potential global pandemic continue to grow. Governments, policy makers, and health care providers (HCP), are planning for future pandemics, in part, based upon the lessons learned from SARS. Health Canada [5] has identified gaps in the response to SARS that should influence current policies and planning. For example, there is still a need to address ethical concerns during a pandemic, for instance, governments may be required to infringe upon civil liberties to ensure infection control, and policy makers need to establish frameworks for decisionmaking to allocate scarce health care resources [6] . A lack of coordination and communication, the poor management of resources, and the absence of a clear leadership structure within organizations and government also had a detrimental effect on the effort to control the SARS outbreak [6] [7] [8] .",

            "text": "In an effort to learn from SARS and to prepare for a future pandemic, the Government of Canada has released the \"Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Sector\" [4] . Similarly, the majority of provincial and territorial governments have also released their regional plans [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] (see Table 1 for selected features of pandemic plans in various jurisdictions). These documents guide health planning and responses at provincial and local levels. Government plans cover topics ranging from influenza surveillance, to the distribution of antiviral supplies, to communication and information dissemination. Although these plans are designed to protect all Canadian citizens, there continues to be a lack of dialogue or guidance to address the specialized needs of a pediatric population. Children may require specialized supplies, medications, and treatment. They also require additional supervision and family support [27] . Additionally, pandemic planning for children and families is often addressed locally, with little coordination among the various levels of planning [28] . This continued neglect of pediatrics, both by policy makers and researchers in pandemic planning, is problematic, as difficulties associated with psychosocial concerns or ethical decision-making are magnified for HCP, children and families [29] . In this paper, we present both provincial and territorial policy statements as they relate to pediatrics based on a website review of plans. We also present the qualitative results from a survey administered to pediatric pandemic planning practitioners and policy makers. The goal of the project is to assess the comprehensiveness of existing pandemic plans in Canada and to identify what professionals identified as important and needed in pediatric plans. ",

As such, the literature about ethics in pandemic planning focuses primarily on adult care [30] [31] [32] . Thompson and colleagues have identified general values to guide care and policy for pandemic planning. These values include: the duty to provide care, equity, individual liberty, privacy, proportionality, protection of the public from harm, reciprocity, solidarity, stewardship, and trust [30] . Although these values are central to ethical planning and decision-making, many may be interpreted differently in pediatrics. For example, individual liberty does not apply to children in the same way as adults. Compared to adults, children lack autonomy and parents must advocate and make health care decisions on their child's behalf. Due to the lack of literature on this topic, policy makers must individually interpret the ethical issues in pediatric care. As such, policy makers who strive to maintain ethical care in pediatrics should be guided by ethical values, and stay aware of the needs of children and families. In this paper, participants identify situations where such ethical policy making must be implemented.",

Based upon qualitative analyses of survey data, participants have provided important and useful feedback on the needs and essential elements in a pediatric pandemic plan, the importance of listening to children and families, the need for communication with stakeholder groups, and factors resulting in under-developed or missing plans. Unfortunately, however, not all recommendations from participants are currently being implemented in provincial and territorial plans. This is exemplified in the congruence between what respondents felt were essential plan elements and the elements they identified as missing from their organizational or regional plans. There are clear and notable gaps in pediatric planning, both in terms of elements reported as missing by participants in their organizations' or regions' pandemic plans and in the parallel gaps in the provincial, territorial and national policy documents that were reviewed. For example, a lack of psychosocial and ethical policies in planning for pediatric care were identified as major gaps by survey respondents, and confirmed by our policy review. These discontinuities in identified key elements, and existing policies, point to the need for consideration of children and families at all levels of the planning process. Moreover, this lack of pediatric specific considerations is noted in the perceptions of survey respondents who indicated that children do not have unique needs in the event of a pandemic and in the lack of policies across provinces and territories pertaining directly to the care of children and families. To address the needs of this population effectively, the authors suggest the incorporation of pediatric plans within broader provincial, territorial and national plans.",

Likewise, BC is an example of a province with relative wealth, and a high population density in urban areas, for instance, BC reported the third highest population growth among the provinces during 2007 (14.9 per 1000) to reach a population of 4,414,000, one of the more populated provinces in Canada [33] .

These issues and concerns were also supported by survey respondents, who are experts in pediatric care and pandemic planners, qualified to note such gaps in contingency plans. To overcome these gaps, a focus on the unique needs of children and families is required, while support and resource redistribution to less advantaged provinces and territories is needed to ensure the health and well-being of all Canadians. Consideration of the factors that influence pandemic preparedness (such as population density, affluence, relative isolation, and available resources) may be helpful to inform research and policy decisions. Finally, the dissemination of information online, especially via government websites, is essential to communicate with the public during a pandemic. In brief, the findings presented here provide important suggestions to guide pandemic planning in pediatrics, in the hope that a pandemic response can ensure the safety of Canadians.",
