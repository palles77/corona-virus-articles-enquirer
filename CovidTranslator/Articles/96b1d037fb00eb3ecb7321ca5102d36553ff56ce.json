Dirofilarias are natural parasites of a great variety of animals and, with the exception of D. immitis, live in the subcutaneous tissue of their hosts, produce circulating microfilariae, and are transmitted by mosquitoes (2) . The principal reservoir of D. repens is the dog. Humans are accidental hosts with patent infections being extremely rare. Differential diagnoses of HSD include neoplasia and other granulomatous diseases, and a definitive diagnosis usually requires surgical removal and examination of a granuloma.",
