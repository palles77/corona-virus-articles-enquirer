The response to the Swine flu pandemic has been ambivalent, both on the societal (political) and the scientific level. While some scientists warned against potential massive loss of human lives and urged for immediate and large-scale vaccination, others accused them of unnecessary scaremongering, arguing that the pandemic would not be that severe. The lab-created virulent Avian flu virus e which has been created in order to 'fight' a potential Avian flu pandemic e sparked a fierce debate on the dual-use risks of such a pre-emptive strategy. This article involves an analysis of the medical-political response to these recent viral threats using Peter Sloterdijk's immunological framework as diagnostic tool. In his trilogy Spheres Sloterdijk uses immunological concepts to analyse and assess the contemporary biopolitical situation. It shows how drawing a parallel between the functioning of the biological immune system and \"immune responses\" on sociopolitical level enables to assess and reconceptualise biosecurity.",

By drawing on recent insights in the functioning of the biological immune system it is shown how a One-Health approach that incorporates a broader and nuanced \"immunological\" repertoire could act as counter-measure against \"autoimmune\" responses in biosecurity.",

By the 1970s it had become common to believe that infectious diseases were declining and would be soon eliminated through medical progress. This optimistic view appears to have been na\u00efve. In recent decades the world has been confronted with an ever-increasing number of novel or re-emerging infectious diseases, some of them causing true pandemics. Striking examples were the emergence of Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the early 1980s and the more recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Zanetti and Zappa, 2010) . It has been widely accepted in modern science that new viral strains will emerge and continue to pose challenges to public health and the scientific communities of future societies (Cohen, 2000; Medina and Garcia-Sastre, 2011; Sassetti and Rubin, 2007) .",

In his 'Immunology of Spheres', Sloterdijk uses immunological concepts to analyse and assess the current biopolitical situation. He draws a parallel between the immune system on the biological level and immune systems on socio-political and cultural level. By building on this analogy between the biological immune system and \"immune responses\" on socio-political level, this article shows how an immunological framework can be fruitful for grasping (assessing and reconceptualising) biosecurity. This mode of inquiry into problematisations of biosecurity is that of a second-order observer (Rabinow) (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, p.12) . The analysis will be illustrated with quotations from Nature and Science articles (News and Opinion articles & Editorials) that deal with these two threats. The 'Sloterdijkean' analysis will be supplemented with the views of the American cultural critic Susan Sontag (1933e2004) , notably her notion of apocalyptic discourse as reflected in her commentary on the AIDS pandemic in the late 1980s (notably in AIDS and its Metaphors, 1988) .",

Biosecurity measures sometimes risk evolving into \"autoimmune\" responses. Autoimmunity is a biological concept that refers to an immune response directed against a body's own cells and tissues. In its metaphorical use as diagnostic tool, autoimmunity refers to a situation in which the protective measurements are more destructive than the original threats themselves and immunisation becomes a major threat to social (political) life itself. In the final part, it is shown how a One-Health approach could mitigate and act as counter-measure against the tendency towards \"autoimmune\" responses (whether caused by virological research, industrial animal agriculture or other institution). It will be shown how on the biological level the immune system does not simply operate as 'defence army' against all possible intruders of the body. Whether a virus or a microbe is 'seen' as something that must be attacked and destroyed is very depended upon the context in which the immune reaction takes place. Immunological processes like tolerance ('silence' of the immune system upon encounter of a pathogen) and autoimmunity have proven that the immune system is far more complicate than a protective army against destructive invaders (Tauber, 2008, p.272) . In this article, it is defended that such biomedical insights on the functioning of the immune system enable to assess and reconceptualise biosecurity.",

They defend us from looming threats coming from outside and create an ambiance, a place that humans can inhabit and that allows them to live their life in the immensity of the world. Humans are beings that have built and build caves, houses, villages, cities, nation-states, cultures, world-views etc., which act as immune systems or immune responses against possible threats from the outside world. This capacity to build protective spheres is not restricted to material environments such as villages, cities and, eventually, the metropolises of today, but it also involves protective ideological and symbolical structures such as metaphysical and religious views.",

Sloterdijk's notion of 'explication' is akin to Heidegger's notions of 'unveiling' [Entbergung] , which for both of them constitutes the core of science and technology. Sloterdijk refers to the 20th century as the \"age of explication\" [Explikationszeitalter] (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.228) . In this century, science and technology have developed rapidly. From the time of Pasteur and Koch onwards, for example, human beings suddenly had to take explicit measures to protect themselves against the thus far unknown microbes. Sloterdijk shows how new knowledge also results in the corollary explication (and thus perception) of new risks and threats. Indeed, in Sloterdijk's view, 'immunisation' (as cultural phenomenon, including its biomedical forms) has nowadays become a focus of concern, due to forces of globalisation. This is illustrated by a profound desire for protection by means of insurances, security measures, vaccines, and so on. However, these 'immunisation' measures simultaneously (and paradoxically) entail a growing sense of more and deeper insecurity, which, in its turn, entails more and more emphasis on immunisation and so on. In the following, Sloterdijk's immunological framework will be operationalised. The Sloterdijkean concepts of 'immunisation' and 'explication' of Sloterdijk will be applied as diagnostic tool to analyse and problematise the biosecurity measures taken in response to successively the Swine flu pandemic and the Avian flu threat. However, this article extends Sloterdijk's immunological framework. It also employs other immunological concepts, such as the notion of autoimmunity. By drawing a more complete and precise parallel between the functioning of the biological immune system and \"immune responses\" on socio-political level some contemporary biosecurity measures are further assessed and problematised. In the third part, it is shown how a One-Health approach could 'cure' some of the 'pains' (i.e. \"autoimmune\" responses) of contemporary biosecurity.",

It then killed up to 50 million people worldwide (Nabel et al., 2011) . Accordingly, in several scientific articles the severity of the threat (and the 'immunisation measures' considered necessary) was stressed by referring to the dreadfulness of this 1918 pandemic of the Spanish flu (Barry, 2009) . Following the threat and these premonitions, an \"immunisation response\" erupted, not only on the biomedical scene (development and distribution of vaccines and antiviral medicines) but also at the societal level (public health measures; surveillance, quarantine, hygiene, etc.).",

            "text": "On the one hand, virology in general enables the emergence of an effective biological immunisation response, such as in the H1N1 case. Virological research has revealed the genetic characteristics of H1N1, its transmissibility, etc. in order to make informed decisions on how to control and counteract the virus's spread (Hayden, 2009 ). On the other hand, virological research obviously increases our knowledge about viruses, about their genes, their virulence, their interaction with hosts, and their spread. This progressive understanding has also made us more aware of the potential new risks we are exposed to. This ambivalent effect of virological research is captured nicely by the following quote from Nature: \"The boost in research spending on epidemiological modelling and laboratory studies has enabled scientists to understand the H1N1 virus in record time, prepare to manufacture vaccine faster, make more informed decisions on how to intervene in the virus's spread, and understand and share information on its genetic characteristics\" (Hayden, 2009, p.756) . In this phrase, it is suggested that our increased knowledge will boost our immunisation response. In the following quote, however, the basic ambivalence already becomes more apparent: \"If researchers know the key genetic regions that facilitate reassortment, surveillance efforts could watch out for H5N1 of H1N1 viruses with changes in those regions, ones that might be on the verge of dangerous reassortments\" (Maher and Butler, 2009, p.157) . In other words, increased knowledge about the Swine flu genes might result in the discovery of an even more dangerous and virulent 'reassortment' of the virus. Reassortment, or gene mixing, refers to the exchange of segments of the viral genome of two distinct virus strains as a result of simultaneous infection of a single cell by two distinct influenza viruses. This can result in the generation of a novel influenza virus strain, and it is believed that most human pandemic viruses actually arose in this way (Medina and Garcia-Sastre, 2011) .",

On the contrary, increased knowledge about Swine flu has resulted in the emergence of new and previously unknown threats, the threat of an even more virulent virus. This new disconcerting knowledge involves what Sloterdijk refers to as 'collateral damage' (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.200 ). If new diseases or new viral strains are discovered, the feelings of security or comfort (among both experts and the public) will not increase. The opposite is actually more true, there is an increase of uneasiness or distrust because of the increased awareness of new potential risks in society (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.198e201 ). This is a paradigmatic example of what could be termed the 'immunisation paradox', the idea that \"immunisation measures\" result in the concomitant 'explication' of previously unknown risks and threats and feelings of insecurity, which entail more and more emphasis on immunisation.",

Secondly, new knowledge about viruses and new techniques, for example the technique of 'resurrecting' former (now extinct) viruses such as the 1918 flu virus, actually creates new forms of risk associated with the technology itself. Although a fully reconstructed virus might gain a better understanding of the virus and thus be instrumental in fighting the next pandemic, there is nonetheless a risk of accidental or intentional release (bioterrorism) of the virus from the lab (Beck, 2002; Bubnoff, 2005; Interlandi, 2010) .

There have definitively been casualties: the most seriously affected involved relatively young people, and one quarter of the seriously afflicted patients had no pre-existing underlying disease (Butler, 2009; Osterhaus, 2010 ). Yet, the downside of the lack of virulence of H1N1 and the relative mildness of the pandemic is that many countries were left with a stockpile of unused H1N1 vaccines. As a result, in hindsight, many governments have been criticised for squandering taxpayers' money on supplies that were not needed. Several critics have been prompting accusations that the WHO has been guilty of scaremongering and exaggerating the Swine flu threat and accordingly have accused scientists and the WHO of 'over-reacting'. Moreover, these critics point to partnerships between the virologists involved and drugs companies providing the vaccines (Butler, 2010a; Cohen and Carter, 2010 ; Editorial Nature, \"Lessons from a pandemic\", 2010).",

The concept of autoimmunity has its origins in the biomedical sphere and indicates -in simplified terms e a situation in which the immune system operates so powerfully, that it produces detrimental effects for the body it is supposed to safeguard. When used as a metaphor for socio-political responses, autoimmunity refers to a situation when the striving for immunisation or self-protection becomes more damaging to the life e the veins and tissues e of society than the original threat. In that case, the protection of life, the effort to exclude any intrusion from the outside may become obsessive to such an extent that it risks destroying not only the alleged enemy outside, but first and foremost the social 'body' it is meant to protect, i.e., society.",

He warns for an imminent pandemic of a viral (flu) strain. The exact moment it will strike is yet uncertain but the fact that a pandemic will strike sooner or later is something to be expected (Osterhaus, 2010) . Many virologists such as Osterhaus justify their warnings against a pandemic by saying that we always should 'expect the unexpected' (Butler, 2009, p.21; Weiss and McMichael, 2004, p.S75; Howard and Fletcher, 2012, p.10 ). This rhetoric is comparable to the rhetoric on AIDS described by Susan Sontag in AIDS and its Metaphors (1988), which seems to be aimed at accustoming us with \"the intermittent awareness of a monstrous, unthinkable e but we are told quite probable e pandemic catastrophe\" (Sontag, 1988 p.88) . Such taste for worstcase scenarios seems to reflect the constant need to master fear of what is felt to be out of control (1988, p.87) . The warning 'expect the unexpected' entails a situation in which constant fear is provoked, rather than fear of a specific disease at a specific moment; as such, it produces a kind of sustained state of fear. Sontag (1988) has argued how it seems that in modern society, the end is believed to be near, but this is a \"long-running serial\", a protracted condition rather than a terminal event. It is a state that always looms but never happens (Sontag, 1988, p.88 ; see also Fitzpatrick, 2003 Fitzpatrick, , p.1310 . As she puts it, it is not \"Apocalypse Now,\" but rather \"Apocalypse from now on\" (Sontag, 1988 p.88) . It seems that virologists who warn for the looming threat of viruses and pandemics try to make the pandemic catastrophe a key element of our \"ordinary horizon of expectations\". In contemporary society, the state of concern has become interminable (Cooper, 2008a,b; Fitzpatrick, 2003) , which can be regarded \"an autoimmune pathology\", or as Sontag puts it: \"an unparallelled violence that is being done to our sense of reality, to our humanity\" (Sontag, 1988 p.88) .",

Viral infections are particularly difficult to eradicate because viruses adapt continuously to their environment by mutation, recombination or gene reassortment (Morens et al., 2004) . Furthermore, globalisation promotes the emergence and spread of new infections and pandemics (Zanetti and Zappa, 2010) . Accordingly, virologists state that \"yet at the end of the day, making predictions about this new H1N1's next move is a mug's game. There's nothing more predictable about flu than its unpredictability\" (Cohen, 2009a, p.997) . When, where and how the next catastrophe will strike remains uncertain, disaster is always incubating and one can only speculate (Ewald, 2001) . Accordingly, the inescapable elusive and uncertain characteristics of viral threats call for drastic and immediate \"immunisation measures\". Some virologists argue that H2N2 looms and could re-emerge in a similar way as H1N1 did. Accordingly, they urge for a \"pre-emptive\" vaccination strategy against this potential threat (Nabel et al., 2011; St\u20ac ohr, 2010 ). Yet, such pre-emptive strategies are likely to generate their own incalculable dangers and incorporate autoimmunitary aspects, as will be shown in the next section.",

In Life as Surplus (2008), Cooper points out that what is radically new about this doctrine is that the US authorised itself to use pre-emptive action against a threat that is not so much imminent as emergent; \"a threat whose actual occurrence remains irreducibly speculative, impossible to locate or predict\" (Cooper, 2008b, p.124) . In recent decades, newly emerging infectious diseases, but also bioterrorist threats, such as the anthrax attacks of 2002, induced a shift in the approach to disease from classic public health (managing known diseases) to preparedness practices (developing the capacity to respond to yet unknown potentially catastrophic biological events (Lakoff, 2008;  pp.14, 33e60)).",

In view of a potential future Avian flu pandemic, two groups of scientists (one led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Tokyo and the University of WisconsineMadison, and one led by Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands), have created mutant H5N1 Avian influenza variants that can be transmitted between ferrets, which are a good proxy for how flu behaves in other mammals, including humans (Herfst et al., 2012; Imai et al., 2012) . To date, however, H5N1 viruses have very scarcely been transmitted between humans. Nevertheless, as H5N1 viruses continue to evolve and infect humans, the viral experts concerned warn for the fact that variants of H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential, including Avianehuman reassortant viruses, might emerge (Kawaoka, 2012) . In this specific case, the doctrine of preemption implies that we need not only to mobilise against currently circulating viruses, but against a potential emergence of a possible disease, in this case a transmissible mutant version of the Avian flu, which (as far as one knows) does not exist yet. This could be regarded as a form of 'anticipatory evolution' (Bacher et al., 2002) .",

Moreover, the pre-emptive strategy also involves \"autoimmunitary\" aspects: although the studies were aimed at finding ways to prevent a devastating Avian influenza pandemic (to engineer a cure), they involved the creation of a novel, more transmissible Avian flu virus. Thus, this simple act seemed to enhance the chances of a pandemic, owing to either a lab accident or intentional release by terrorists. Nature also warns against the dangers (the \"autoimmunitary\" aspects) of this development by arguing that one should keep in mind that public health services are currently not equipped to mitigate a H5N1 pandemic, either accidental or intentional, due to the (worldwide) limited abilities to manufacture and distribute vaccines (Editorial Nature, 2012; Cohen, 2009b) .",

There is an increased demand for public health preparedness to focus not only on interventions against known recorded viral strains but on generic measures that would be effective against yet unknown, not recorded but theoretically possible viral strains (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, p.12e16) . The idea behind pre-emption is to intervene in the conditions of emergence of the future, before one may be besieged by nature's own act of emergence (Cooper, 2008a, p.91) . In the case of the mutant Avian flu, virologists make use of exactly that argument. Professor John Oxford from Barts and the London School of Medicine says, \"The biggest risk with bird flu is from the virus itself. We should forget about bio terrorism and concentrate on Mother Nature\" (Walsh, 2011, p.1) . In similar vein, Osterhaus argues that the bigger danger is that \"nature will do the first job\" (quoted from Check, 2005, p.406) . Similarly, Fouchier and De Jong (virologists) claim that \"nature is the biggest terrorist\" (Carvajal, 2011, p.A28; Visser, 2012, p.1) . Their argument clearly states that virologists should be allowed to pre-emptively 'attack' nature, before nature itself will 'attack' us.",

Medical technology can also pose a risk and unintentionally introduce and spread infectious diseases. Drug-resistant microbes, contaminated equipment or biological medicines produced from animal-cell substrates can also present an inherent potential for introducing new infections (Weiss and McMichael, 2004) . All these factors cause patterns of infectious diseases to change globally and on a massive scale. This illustrates how human health obviously cannot be separated from planetary conditions in general, i.e. from our total planetary 'health', including the health status of its animate and inanimate environment (see also, Canguilhem, 1989) . We live in interdependent existence with the totality of the living and non-living world. Accordingly, today we understand that the concept of the microbe as the single cause of infection (as Koch has postulated) is inadequate and incomplete, because it ignores the influence of the host, the milieu, and the social and physical environment (Budd et al., 2009; Weiss and McMichael, 2004; Wilson, 1995) . Next to all fundamental viral research, we should pay at least as much attention to the ecological and climatological factors such as increased global population, increased travel, intensive animal farming and food production, global climate change, prophylactic doses of antibiotics and other drugs, and so on (Rappuoli, 2004) .",

            "text": "In immunology, a similar development towards more attention for the context (of immune responses) can be traced. In the 19th century, immunology began as a study on how a host organism reacts to pathogenic injury and how it defends itself against microbial incursion (Tauber, 1999, p.459) . In that pathological context, immunology came to be defined as the science that discriminates between self and non-self (other) (Tauber, 1994) . In recent decades, processes such as immunological tolerance ('silence' of the immune system upon the encounter of a pathogen) and autoimmunity have pointed immunologists to the fact that the immune system is far more complex than simply a 'defence army' against destructive invaders (Tauber, 2008, p.272) . It appeared that the immune system does not attack and destroy all invading pathogens, but includes a more nuanced and diverse repertoire. Immunologists increasingly recognise the importance of the 'context' of immune reactivity (Tauber, 2008 (Tauber, , 2012 . Whether a virus or microbe is 'seen' as 'enemy' is dependent upon the context in which the immune reaction takes place. It appears that an antigen (that which elicits an immune response) is not a priori 'non-self' or the 'enemy', but only attains its 'meaning' within a particular context. In other words, immune responses are not based on intrinsic foreignness, but rather on how the immune system perceives an antigen (of the virus) in the larger context of the body's economy (Tauber, 2000, p.241 ). The immune system is thus in constant 'dialogue' with surrounding tissues and the exterior. In that way, the immune system determines what is to be protected and healed and what is foreign, and thus must be attacked and destroyed (Tauber, 2000 (Tauber, , 2008 .",

The contextual scheme of immunology should be transposed to the level of \"immunisation measures\" involved in biosecurity. Parallel to the immune system, which appears to be far more complex and nuanced than a destructive army, the \"immune responses\" involved in biosecurity should be more nuanced and complex and take into account the context in which they take place. \"Immunisation measures\" that do not take into account the context in which they are applied do not only risk developing into \"autoimmune\" responses but they are also less effective (Bingham and Hinchliff, 2008, p.174e193 ). This context thus not only involves the climatological and ecological factors involved in the emergence of viral threats (as emphasised by \"ecological virologists\" or \"evolutionary virologists\" (Cf. Suttle, 2007; Galama, 2010; Varela et al., 2009; Wilson, 1995) , but also the political context and socioeconomic conditions (Bingham and Hinchliff, 2008, p.174e193 ). Thus, a One-Health approach will not only prevent \"immunisation responses\" evolving into \"autoimmune\" responses but also increases the effectiveness of biosecurity measures. A One-Health approach that incorporates a broader and more nuanced \"immunological repertoire\" than aggressive counter-proliferation not only acts as counter-measure against autoimmunitary tendencies but might also vitalise e in the words of Sloterdijk e the \"mental immune status of our enlightened society\" (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.196 ).",

It has been argued how viral research potentially brings about 'collateral damage', through the explication of formerly unknown risks, for example the emergence of a more virulent reassortment of the virus. Given important characteristics of viruses such as their invisibility, their unpredictability, and their capacity to mutate quickly, virologists are bound to caution that despite immunisation measures, viral threats are always looming. This further promotes the shift to preparedness in public health, including a practice of pre-emption. The lab-bred mutant Avian flu is a paradigmatic example thereof. However, such strong defensive (and preventive) \"immunisation measures\" risk evolving into \"autoimmune\" responses. In the context of this article, \"autoimmune\" responses involve a situation in which protective measures (against a viral threat) are more destructive for society than the original viral threat itself.",

The \"autoimmune\" aspects of the lab-bred Avian flu involve not only the creation of new viruses, but also psychological damage by creating a permanent state of fear. More importantly, as long as virologists regard 'nature as the biggest bioterrorist', the worrisome entanglement between the protection of biological life (immunisation) and war including its \"autoimmunitary\" effects will be furthered rather than contested.",

From the perspective of One-Health, the 'other' whether a virus or anything else is not a priori the enemy that has to be 'fought' and 'defeated'. The biological immune system does not simply operate as 'defence army' but mediates aggressive as well as cooperative (tolerant) interactions (Tauber, 2008) . More importantly, whether a virus or microbe is 'seen' as 'enemy' is dependent upon the context in which the immune reaction takes place. It appears that an antigen (that which elicits an immune response) is not a priori 'other' or the 'enemy', but only attains its 'meaning' within a particular context. In other words, immune responses are not based on intrinsic foreignness, but rather on how the immune system perceives an antigen (of the virus) in the larger context of the body's economy (Tauber, 2000, p.241) . Analogously, the \"immune systems\" on socio-political level involved in biosecurity should also include a broader and more nuanced \"immunological repertoire\". On the socio-political level not all viruses need to be (pre-emptively) 'fought'. A One-Health approach that involves such attention for the context in which (socio-political) immune reactions take place is needed.",
