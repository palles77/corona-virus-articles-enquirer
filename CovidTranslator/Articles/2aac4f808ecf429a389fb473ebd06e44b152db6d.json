This study aimed at describing the epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection, clinical aspects of the disease and the determinants of survival. Methods: The medical records of Prince Mohamed Bin Abdulaziz Hospital were reviewed between April 2014 and December 2015 to identify admission and discharge with MERS-CoV. Patient's characteristics, epidemiologic and clinical data and laboratory results were extracted and described. Logistic regression analyses were used to model the determinants of the survival of these patients. Significance of the results were judged at the 5% level. Results: 249 confirmed cases were admitted mostly in August (20.48%) and September (14.86%) of the year 2015. A third (39.36%) reported contact with an index case, developed the disease after 6.2 days and continued to shed the virus for 13.17 days on average. The case fatality rate was 20.08%. Independent predictors of being discharged alive among confirmed cases were younger age (OR A = 0.953), breathing ambient air (OR A = 8.981), not being transferred to the ICU (OR A = 24.240) and not receiving renal replacement therapy (OR A = 8.342). These variables explain 63.9% of the variability of patients' status at discharge. Conclusion: MERS-CoV spread from human-to-human as community acquired and nosocomial infection. The study identified high risk patients in need for special medical attention in order to improve patients' outcome.",

Most of the confirmed cases in this study presented with symptoms of respiratory tract infection including fever, cough and shortness of breath rather than gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Almost all admitted patients were isolated in a room with negative pressure (93.17%) or in a single room (5.22%) to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection.

Ahmed [30] noted the recent decrease in mortality rate among confirmed MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia and attributed the improvement of patients' outcome to the adopted prevention and control policies as well as the attention given to case management. The severity of MRS-CoV ranges from mild to fatal illness [20] and can progress rapidly to severe respiratory distress and death [32, 33] . Respiratory distress was noted in a proportion of MERS-CoV patients at the time they presented to the emergency department; 14.06% Table 3 Probability of being discharged alive among confirmed MERS-CoV cases admitted to PMAH (2014-2015) in relation to their demographic characteristics and clinical status. were on mechanical ventilation and 30.52% were breathing through oxygen mask.

These diseases tend to affect older patients resulting in lower immunity which in turn leads to severe MERS-CoV infection and lower likelihood of survival as shown by this study and previous ones [23, 36] . In fact, younger age independently predicted survival after controlling for the effect of co-morbidities as well as other determinants of survival. The higher probability of survival among younger patients was also reported by Saad et al. [25] and others [22, 23] . Previous studies attributed the low risk of mortality from MERS-CoV among healthcare workers to the fact of being younger [32] and healthy with no history of any co-morbid conditions [32] . Also, their awareness of the risk of exposure may have prompted them to seek early diagnosis and treatment.",

The accumulation of MERS-CoV cases over the period of 21 months provided a unique opportunity to describe the epidemiologic pattern, clinical aspects and outcome of the disease in Riyadh region. The data compiled from the electronic medical records was used as well to estimate the case fatality rate and to identify the predictors of survival. This information may be used by healthcare providers to identify high risk patients in need for special medical attention in order to improve patients' outcome and survival. Nonetheless, the study has a number of limitation inherent to the retrospective charts review. As hospital charts are mainly used for the clinical management and follow up of cases, epidemiologic data necessary for the description of cases in relation to person, place and time were either missing or incomplete. The data provided incomplete information pertinent to the exposure to potential human and animal source of infection, incubation period of the disease as well as period of communicability.",
