Areas that are challenged by limited traditional forage resources commonly have greater grain crop production, resulting in greater availability of crop residue and by-products, particularly from ethanol production (Klopfenstein et al., 2008; Zulauf, 2016) . Research has shown that dry-lot management of cows is a viable alternative to traditional pasture cow-calf production systems (Loerch, 1996; Jenkins et al., 2015; Warner et al., 2015a) , especially using low quality residues and energydense by-products. A simulated economic analysis of an alternative production system suggests that using corn residue grazing as a component of a semi-confined cowcalf production system could reduce production costs of total confinement and provide a competitive alternative to traditional pasture cow-calf production (Warner et al., 2015b) .",

Feed was delivered as a TMR once daily in concrete fence-line feed bunks (0.9 m of linear space per cow-calf pair). Dry matter offered increased by 0.45 kg monthly throughout the experiment to account for increasing intake of the growing calves. In yr 1 and 2, the amount of DM offered ranged from 11.6 to 13.4 kg/d. During yr 1 and 2, cows fed in the dry-lot were gaining BW and BCS and were not at maintenance. To correct for the BW and BCS gain, the amount of DM offered to cows in the dry-lot was reduced to a range of 11.1 to 12.9 kg/d during yr 3.",

The amount of supplement needed to meet the energy requirements of a cow-calf pair grazing corn residue was calculated using estimated residue intake of a pair (Meyer et al., 2012) and estimated digestibility values of corn residue throughout the grazing period (Wilson et al., 2004) . Cow-calf pairs grazing corn residue were supplemented daily in bunks (0.9 m of linear space per pair) with dried distillers grain-based cubes (Table 2 ) at a rate of approximately 2.4 kg (range of 1.7 to 3.2 kg) of DM per pair daily, increasing monthly to account for increased calf requirement and intake. The amount supplemented was initially targeted to provide an equivalent energy intake to that of the dry-lot pairs. However, in yr 3, supplementation to cows on cornstalks was held constant while the DM offered to cows in the dry-lot was reduced. If snow cover prevented grazing, additional supplemental feed was fed to grazing pairs. In yr 2, approximately 77 kg (DM) of ammoniated cornstalks were fed per pair at ENREC.",

The completion of the cornstalk grazing period coincided with weaning of all calves. Cow BW and calf BW were recorded over 2 consecutive days at trial initiation and completion to determine changes in BW from November to April. A trained technician at each location evaluated BCS (Wagner et al., 1988 ; 1 = emaciated; 9 = obese) of cows at trial initiation and completion. Before being weighed at trial initiation, all cow-calf pairs on both treatments were limit fed a common diet for a minimum of 5 consecutive days to reduce weight variation due to gastrointestinal tract fill (Watson et al., 2013) . At trial completion, cows and calves were separated and again limit fed a common diet in the feedlot, to ensure gut fill was similar for both treatments, for a minimum of 5 d before being weighed. Cattle were weighed in the morning on 2 consecutive days before feeding (water not withheld), and those 2 weights were averaged to achieve an initial and final BW, respectively. Cows were exposed to Simmental \u00d7 Angus bulls (1 bull:10 cows on average because 2 bulls were assigned to each paddock after trial initiation) beginning approximately September 25 and September 26 each year with a 73-and 74-d breeding season at ENREC and PREC, respectively. Cows received prebreeding vaccinations for protection against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea (types 1 and 2), parainfluenza-3, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Bovi-Shield Gold FP5 In vitro analysis of corn residue collected from each location was conducted to determine residue quality. Within location, fields were divided into 6 replications for sampling. This was done before harvest before the field was divided into paddocks for grazing. Ten consecutive whole corn plant samples harvested above the anchor root were collected from the 6 sampling sites just before grain harvest. Plant samples were separated into individual plant components (husk, leaf blade, and leaf sheath). Plant components were then composited within replication and ground through a 1-mm screen using a Wiley Mill (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ). Each location was analyzed separately. Composite samples were then analyzed for in vitro OM digestibility in 2 runs using the Tilley and Terry (1963) method modified by the inclusion of 1 g of urea/ mL of buffer (Weiss, 1994) . A set of forage (grass and corn residue) standards with established in vivo values were included in each run to develop regression equations that allowed for the comparison between runs (Geisert, 2007) . Triplicate samples from each plant fraction and standard were weighed into 100-mL in vitro tubes. Rumen fluid was collected from 2 donor steers fed a 30% concentrate diet. McDougall's buffer was mixed with rumen fluid to form inoculum, which was added to each tube. In vitro tubes were then incubated in a 39\u00b0C water bath for 48 h and swirled every 12 h. Following 48 h of incubation, fermentation was ceased by adding 5 mL of 20% hydrochloric acid and 3 mL of 5% pepsin to each tube. Tubes remained in the water bath for an additional 24 h and were then frozen immediately following removal. Contents from each tube were filtered through Whatman 541 filter paper, rinsed with distilled water, and dried in a 100\u00b0C oven for 12 h to determine DM. Filters were then placed in a muffle furnace at 600\u00b0C for 6 h to determine ash and OM (AOAC International, 1999; method 4.1.10). Digestible organic matter (DOM) was calculated by multiplying the in vitro OM digestibility and percent OM of the original residue sample.",

Due to differences in regional availability of corn residue, leased acres for corn residue grazing were priced at $12/0.41 ha and $17/0.41 ha for ENREC and PREC, respectively, which corresponded to $0.20 (ENREC) and $0.30 (PREC) per pair daily. Grazing yardage expenses associated with animal care, fencing, and supplementing was charged at $0.20 per cow-calf pair per day. At ENREC, cows that had been wintered on cornstalks were fed an additional 1.6 kg of feed for 75 d after weaning to compensate for BW and body condition losses incurred throughout the winter grazing period. Therefore, an additional feed cost was charged to CS cows at ENREC. The cost of additional feed was determined by multiplying the total amount fed over 75 d by the diet cost. Calf prices were collected from Schulz (2017) to determine 10-yr average prices received for weaned calves. To account for the lighter weaning weight of CS calves observed at both locations, a price slide of $17.23/45 kg was used to determine the price received for weaned calves.

In the present experiment, the loss in BCS for cows wintered on cornstalks implies that the amount of energy provided was less than anticipated. An overestimation of the quality, residue intake, or both may explain the reduced performance of cows grazing cornstalks. More supplement might be needed to maintain BCS while grazing cornstalk residue.

These data suggest that the energy provided to cows in limit-fed systems may be underestimated or the energy required by confined cows is overestimated. This is difficult to adjust because the NRC model (NASEM, 2016) does not predict this outcome for the cow limit fed a nutrient-dense diet. However, Shike et al. (2009) reported maintaining BCS when limit feeding (1.7% BW) confined, lactating cows diets containing up to 75% dried distillers grains or wet corn gluten feed. Furthermore, we do not know the separate intakes of the cows and calves in either the dry-lot pairs or the stalk-grazing pairs, and the NRC models do not have requirements for pairs. Therefore, we cannot realistically estimate the efficiency of use of energy by either the cows or the calves. Performance of calves is presented in Table 4 . Calves at PREC were approximately 10 d older than calves at ENREC at the onset of the cornstalk grazing period. Similar cow-calf production effects were observed at both locations. Initial calf BW was not significantly different between treatments (P \u2265 0.08). Calves wintered in the dry-lot had greater ending BW and BW change compared with calves grazing cornstalks (P \u2264 0.04). Likewise, calves wintered in the dry-lot had greater ADG and BW per day of age compared with calves grazed on cornstalks (P \u2264 0.03). The observations of this experiment are in agreement with those of Griffin et al. (2012) , who also reported similar weaning weights and ADG for June calves grazed on cornstalks and weaned in April.",

In vitro analysis of the corn residue from each location was conducted to determine whether residue quality was related to the apparent differences in performance of the pairs grazing cornstalks. In vitro OM digestibility and DOM of corn residue from ENREC and PREC are presented in Table 5 . Assuming cattle consume residue (husk, leaf, and sheath) in the same proportion as it is produced on the plant (18% husk, 55% leaf, and 27% sheath; Gardine et al., 2017) , DOM of consumed residue in the current experiment was 42.6 and 55.7% at EN-REC and PREC, respectively. The 13.1% unit difference in DOM of corn residue observed between locations may explain variation in cow-calf performance. A partial budget of incorporating winter cornstalk grazing into a semi-confined cow-calf production system indicated that grazing cow-calf pairs on corn residue was a more profitable system compared with year-round confinement. Sulc and Tracy (2007) also suggested integrating crops and livestock, particularly through residue grazing, improves economic sustainability for crop and livestock operations. A partial budget using data from ENREC (Table 6 ) suggested that winter grazing cow-calf pairs on corn residue resulted in a greater net profit of $112 per pair compared with feeding cow-calf pairs in the dry-lot over the winter. At ENREC, grazing cornstalks saved the system $216 per pair (additional cost \u2212 reduced cost). Because the calves wintered on cornstalks at ENREC were 49 kg lighter at weaning compared with calves wintered in the dry-lot, income was decreased by $104 per calf. The dry-lot cows gained weight and were likely overfed, which would increase the cost slightly. Cows that grazed stalks lost weight and were fed extra feed during the subsequent dry-lot phase before calving at a cost of $20 (Table 6) . Cows were at similar BW before calving. A partial budget for PREC (Table 7) indicated that grazing pairs on cornstalks over the winter resulted in $92 greater net profit per pair compared with cow-calf pairs fed in the dry-lot. By grazing cow-calf pairs on cornstalks at PREC, $175 (additional cost \u2212 reduced cost) was saved compared with feeding in the dry-lot. The 37-kg-lighter weaning weight of calves wintered on cornstalks compared with calves fed in the dry-lot resulted in $83 less income per calf. Overall, the decrease in production cost more than offset reduced performance of calves wintered on cornstalks at both locations.",
