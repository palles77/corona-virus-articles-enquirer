The hurdles encountered include refrigeration, transport, and the need for health professionals to administer the vaccine, all which have led to higher cost. All of the shortcomings of traditional vaccinations have become a deterrent in our effort to improve world health standards. In order to ameliorate these problems, alternative vaccination routes such as oral, nasal, or buccal offer new hope. Among the alternative routes, the oral route is preferred as a result of its advantages over the other routes.",

They also serve as an alternative to the needle phobic, including young children and the elderly. More importantly, oral vaccines are capable of inducing both mucosal and systemic immunity. Recent studies have suggested that in order to produce a more effective vaccine, both systemic and mucosal immunity has to be induced. 2 Nevertheless, the oral delivery of proteins and vaccines faces major physiological barriers such as the acidic environment in the stomach and the enzymatic environment throughout the intestine, as well as formulation challenges such as stability and targeting issues.",

Proteins and peptides are formed by binding of various amino acids. There are 20 naturally occurring amino acids, and they differ only in their side chains. Proteins contain more than 50 amino acids, whereas peptides contain fewer than 20 amino acids. The four levels of protein structures are primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The primary structure includes the sequence of covalently bonded amino acids, and it is dictated by the sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Secondary structures consist of a-helixes, b-sheets, random coils, b-bends, and small loops of the polypeptide chain. The tertiary structure of proteins includes the overall packing in space of various elements of secondary structures, and quaternary structures represent the specific associations of separate protein chains that form a well-defined structure. 5 The primary structure of protein dictates its folding process. Generally, the overall shape is spherical with polar groups on the surface and hydrophobic groups buried in the interior. The fold structure of proteins is stabilized by both noncovalent and covalent forces. These forces include disulfide bridges between cysteine residues, hydrogen bonding, salt bridges between ionic groups, and hydrophobic interactions between side chains of amino acid residues.",

In order to successfully formulate a protein, its stability and bioactivity must be maintained over its shelf life (1.5 to 2 years) and until it reaches the intended target. Any subtle changes in the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure will lead to physical instabilities such as denaturation, aggregation, precipitation, and adsorption. In addition, hydrolysis, deamidation, oxidation, disulfide exchange, b-elimination, and racemization will lead to chemical instability of proteins. Hence, all of these degradation pathways need to be avoided during the formulation process, and a strategy to minimize the probability of their induction should be in place. These strategies include reducing thermal stress by using the lowest temperature possible while spray drying and storing the protein at 4\u00b0C at pH 5.0 to 7.0. Harsh chemicals such as strong acids, bases, and organic solvents will disrupt the higher order structure of proteins, so their use should",

Microparticles are bead-like particles with a diameter greater than 1.0 mm, and they are mostly spherical in shape. Microparticulate delivery systems have been used for a wide range of drugs, including neoplastic agents, vaccines, inactivated bacteria, proteins, and peptides. [7] [8] [9] The matrix of microparticles can be categorized into two classes; monolithic and reservoir. In the monolithic matrix the active agent is dispersed homogeneously within the polymer matrix, whereas in the reservoir matrix the drug is surrounded by the polymer matrix in the mononuclear or polynuclear state (core). The monolithic matrix has the advantage of avoiding the risk of dose dumping due to the rupture of the membrane of the reservoir matrix. Drug release from a monolithic matrix may depend on the solubility of the drug in the matrix, as well as on the porosity and tortuosity of the polymer network. 10 The microparticulate delivery system offers the ability and flexibility to allow it to be formulated into sustained or controlled-release systems with organ or tissue targeting capability. Microparticles have been shown to selectively target drugs to an organ or diseased site. 11, 12 Microparticles also possess the ability to sustain or control the release of various drugs. 13 Additionally, microparticles act as immunological adjuvants in light of the fact that they are particulate in nature. 14 Furthermore, stealth microparticles can be produced with the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG), thus enabling the chemical attachment of PEG chains to a broad range of substances. This pegylation process increases the half-life of circulation, improves drug solubility and stability, and reduces immunogenicity. 8 Conventional chemotherapy in cancer treatment has been widely used in the clinic but it is associated with significant systemic toxicity and the bigger problem of reoccurrence of the tumor. Immunotherapies have been recently developed to boost the immune system to detect cancer and prevent its reoccurrence, thus improving the patient's quality of life. This chapter talks about a few immunological strategies and cancer vaccines that have been researched and could be potential therapies in the future.",

Intestinal Peyer's patches are the predominant sites for oral administration. 15 In the case of particles, the uptake depends on various factors such as size, charge, and hydrophobicity. 16, 17 For oral delivery, it has been reported that particles of size less than 5 mm with positive charge and a hydrophobic nature can preferentially enter the Peyer's patch of the small intestine. 18 Orally delivered vaccines, especially particulate antigens, are recognized and sampled by microfold (M) cells in Peyer's patches. This is followed by transport of the particles to underlying follicles and to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells and macrophages. These APCs can phagocytose the particles, process them, and present them on both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (through cross priming) and MHC class II molecules; as a result, both T and B cells can be triggered, as shown in Figure 5 The major hurdle in oral delivery is protecting the active biological entity from acidic and enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. Another obstacle to be considered while designing an oral vaccine or biologic is the probability of oral tolerance. 21 Low particle uptake and gastric degradation products of antigens can cause oral tolerance. One of the ways to avoid these issues is to formulate microparticles with enteric coating polymers.",

Oral delivery of vaccine antigens or biologics using such polymeric microparticles offers remarkable advantages over others such as induction of mucosal as well as systemic immune response, protection of antigen from gastric degradation, prolonged presentation of antigen to the immune system, and obviation of the need of vaccine adjuvants because microparticles themselves can act as self-adjuvants. 3, 14 Strategically designed particulate delivery systems incorporate enteric polymers to protect the biological entity from harsh gastric conditions and to target ligands to enhance its uptake from M cells of the Peyer's patches in the small intestine. M cells, or microfold cells, act as sampling ports for any foreign entities encountered in the small intestine. These M cells house various dendritic cells and immune cells. For oral vaccines, particles are sampled by M cells, processed by dendritic cells or antigen-presenting cells, and presented on MHC class I or class II molecules. The antigens are further recognized by the immune cells in the vicinity, leading to the cascade of an immune response as shown in Figure 5 .1. The immune response also includes a humoral response by plasma B cells that leads to production of antibodies and their class switching. The role of B cells has been debatable in the past, but a recent study by Mahmoud et al. 23 showed that humoral immunity is important in addition to cell-mediated immunity in the prognosis of cancer. Thus, this route can trigger both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to various cancer vaccines or biologics. The use of microparticles for cancer therapies and the delivery of biologics via the oral route are discussed further later in this chapter.",

Similarly, the rectal, vaginal, and ocular sites offer advantages over the oral route but at the same time have poor patient compliance.

This is similar to stratified squamous epithelia found elsewhere in the body as it has a basal cell layer and a number of differentiating intermediate layers. The epithelial layers increase in size and become flatter as they travel from basal to superficial layers. 3 The turnover time for the buccal epithelium has been estimated at five to six days, 35 which is probably representative of the oral mucosa as a whole. The oral mucosal thickness varies depending on the site. The buccal mucosa measures at 500 to 800 mm, whereas the mucosal thickness of the hard and soft palates, the floor of the mouth, the ventral tongue, and the gingivae measures at about 100 to 200 mm. The composition of the epithelium also varies depending on the site in the oral cavity. The mucosae of areas subject to mechanical stress (the gingivae and hard palate) are keratinized similar to the epidermis. The mucosae of the soft palate, sublingual, and buccal regions, however, are not keratinized. 35 The keratinized epithelia are relatively impermeable to water. In contrast, non-keratinized epithelia, such as the floor of the mouth and the buccal epithelia, do not contain acylceramides and only have small amounts of ceramide. 36, 37 They also contain small amounts of neutral but polar lipids, mainly cholesterol sulfate and glucosyl ceramides. These epithelia have been found to be considerably more permeable to water than keratinized epithelia. [35] [36] [37] ",

Hence, buccal immunization can help to elicit both mucosal and systemic immunity. 38, 39 Etchart et al. 40 reported that immunization with DNA injected into the buccal mucosa of mice induced a measles virus hemagglutinin-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte response in the spleen. It was also seen by Lundholm et al. 41 that pDNA administered to the oral cheek of mice using a jet injection induced production of immunoglobulin A (IgA), signifying a mucosal immune response.

Since the latter part of the 20th century, pulmonary delivery has been used for the local delivery of drugs for diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but more recently it is also being considered as a viable alternative for the systemic delivery of both small and large molecules. 43 Biologics are most certainly replacing conventional small molecule drugs as the therapy for the future. Their potency and specificity give them an edge, making them more popular with pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries. However, there are challenges associated with their delivery because of their inherent properties such as high molecular weight, hydrophilicity, and instability, which is why they are predominantly administered by parenteral routes so as to ensure their direct entry into systemic circulation. In order to improve their patient compliance, many non-invasive routes of delivery are being explored, and pulmonary delivery is one of them. 44 Pulmonary delivery has emerged as a promising alternative because of the unique anatomical features of the lungs. The lungs provide a large absorptive surface area (up to 100 m 2 ), an extremely thin (0.1 to 0.2 mm) absorptive mucosal membrane, and excellent vascularization, but it is challenging to incorporate the drug in a formulation that will deliver it to such a depth in the lungs that will permit permeation of the drug into blood circulation. The respiratory system is equipped with a series of filters designed to protect the lungs from undesirable environmental material and to keep the lungs clean. This factor must be taken into consideration for a particular therapy to be sufficiently effective. Low efficiency and a large variability have been the major factors that have prevented this route of administration from gaining complete acceptance. Some of the factors that affect the deposition of the drug in the alveolar regions of the lung are uptake by alveolar macrophages and proteolytic degradation.",

Irrespective of the type of drug being delivered (small molecule or large molecule), the above factors have to be considered when preparing a formulation for pulmonary delivery. 45 Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) have been traditionally used for the delivery of measured doses to the lung and are commonly used to deliver drugs to the lung for the treatment of diseases such as asthma or COPD. Another commercially available system, the AERx \u00ae Pulmonary Delivery System by Aradigm uses a bolus of aerosol particles that can be delivered at a certain time during inspiration. The bolus is produced by a piston that empties a small liquid reservoir into the inhalation air. Other devices, including the AKITA \u00ae inhalation system (Activaero) and the ProDose\u2122 system (Profile Therapeutics), also use the bolus inhalation technique to deposit particles in the lungs. The bolus delivery technique can help to increase particle deposition in the lungs. Nectar Therapeutics, along with Pfizer, came up with Exubera \u00ae for the inhalable delivery of insulin for the treatment of diabetes. This form of insulin was expected to replace all forms of injected insulin but the product lasted on the market for only little over a year after being introduced in September 2006. It was soon recalled, as it was cost ineffective and provided the same efficacy as injected insulin. Since then, a number of other companies (e.g., MannKind Corporation, Aerogen, Dance Biopharm) have been attempting to develop a form of inhalable insulin that is less expensive to produce than Exubera.",

As a result, two active immunotherapy agents, sipuleucel-T and ipilimumab, have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of prostate cancer and melanoma, respectively. GVAX \u00ae cellular vaccine (Cell Genesysis, Inc.) is another active immunotherapy agent that targets prostate cancer and has been well studied in various clinical trials. van den Eertwegh et al. 58 studied the combination of two active immunotherapy approaches (GVAX and ipilimumab) for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Whereas GVAX is designed to amplify the antitumor response specific to prostate cancer cells, ipilimumab contributes to T-cell activation. Thus, the authors presented the possibility of augmenting antitumor T-cell activity in two different ways.",

There are many potential sources of tumor antigens, including purified or synthesized tumor cell surface molecules, which may be peptides or proteins, cells or lysates derived from fresh or cryopreserved autologous tumor samples (actually a mixture of normal and malignant cells), and cells or lysates of allogeneic or autologous tumor cell lines. There are a variety of methods by which tumor antigens can be presented including as purified antigen, via heat shock proteins, in viruses or DNA, by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, or as the idiotypes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been selected by their tumor antigen recognition.

This chapter touches upon some of the research carried out in our laboratory on oral microparticulate vaccine or biologics delivery. It had long been assumed that if cancer vaccines could elicit a strong enough immune response they could overcome tumor-induced immune suppression, but after poor clinical results for so many promising vaccines it is now being realized that immunogenicity is not enough. In addition to a strong vaccine, tumor-induced immunosuppression must be actively reduced, and this may be achieved through combination with the arsenal of chemotherapy agents already in use. 73 In a Phase III trial for sipileucel-T (Provenge \u00ae , Dendreon Corporation), the first autologous vaccine consisted of activated dendritic cells comprised of granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) approved by the FDA for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. This vaccine included a large proportion of antigenpresenting cells, which were infused back into the patient to stimulate antitumor T-cell responses. 74 The results showed higher median overall survival compared to placebo-treated patients, resulting in a 22% relative reduction in the risk of death, but it failed to show benefit in progression-free survival, and tumor regressions were rare. 60, 61 This is an example of a personalized vaccine.",

Preliminary clinical trials suggest that administering a therapeutic vaccine followed by ipilimumab enhances immune responses and tumor reduction in prostate and ovarian cancers as well as melanoma. 80 Similarly, in the transgenic murine prostate cancer model, a tumor shrinkage effect was observed with combination therapy of whole cell GM-CSF-secreting vaccine (GVAX) and lowdose cyclophosphamide one to two days before immunization with vaccine alone. This effect was associated with a reduced Treg population in the tumor and its lymph nodes, as well as stimulation of dendritic cell activity. 81 Apart from chemotherapy and vaccine combinations, novel antibodies targeting certain cancers may also be used in conjunction with certain cancer vaccines and anticancer drugs.

The vaccine formulation consisted of meningococcal CPS polymers (Serogroup A) and/or adjuvant (kdtA) encapsulated in albumin-based biodegradable matrix microparticles that mimic the chemical conjugation process of CPS to a protein carrier, thus enhancing antigen uptake via albumin receptors and eliciting a T-cell-dependent immune response. 8, 12 The ability of the CPS-loaded microparticles to induce cytokine and chemokine release from macrophages was investigated in an in vitro cell culture model of THP-1 human macrophage-like cells. Dose-dependent release of TNF-a ( Figure 5. 3) from THP-1cells exposed to meningococcal CPS-loaded microparticles, but not empty microparticles, was observed. The cytokine release reflects the recognition and immunostimulatory activity of the polysaccharide antigen in the microparticle matrix. Taken together, the data suggested that CPS-loaded microparticles are recognized by macrophages and the encapsulation in BSA matrix did not hamper the immunostimulatory activity of CPS.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses cause a highly contagious disease in the human respiratory tract, such as the nose, lungs, and throat. Symptoms of influenza infection are fever, sore throat, headache, cough, and fatigue. 92 During the influenza epidemic of 1918 the deadly virus killed approximately 50 million people globally. 93 In 2009, a new strain of influenza virus (H1N1) emerged and spread quickly throughout the world, causing the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. There are two types of influenza vaccines: the \"flu shot\" and the nasal-spray flu vaccine. 92 Flu shots contain inactivated influenza virus, while the nasal-spray flu vaccine (FluMist \u00ae ) is made with live attenuated flu viruses. Oral administration is a potential route for vaccination because there is no need for trained medical personnel for administration, thus leading to increased coverage of vaccination, as seen in case of oral polio vaccination. 94 Development of a novel influenza oral vaccine will have a significant impact on improving public health. 95 In one case study, microparticulate vaccine was developed by using inactivated influenza (A/PR/34/8 H1N1) virus as an antigen, which was incorporated into a polymer matrix (Eudragit \u00ae S). 96 For in vivo testing, BALB/c mice were immunized with two doses within a three-week interval. Serum samples was analyzed and proved that microparticulate vaccine enhanced antigen-specific antibodies ( Figure 5.5) . Also, these mice were challenged with heterologous influenza viruses, and the results showed a significant induction level of protection via this technology. 96 Another trend of developing influenza vaccine is to minimize the number of doses. One innovative approach is to broaden protective efficacy by using the extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) antigen, which is common among influenza A viruses. 97 This group replaced the hyperimmunogenic region of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium flagellin (FliC) with four repeats of M2e (4.M2e-tFliC) and fused it to a membrane anchor from influenza virus hemagglutinin to establish a membrane-anchored fusion protein.",

The results proved the DNA vaccine is a promising platform for transdermal delivery via microneedles to induce specific antibodies for in vitro and in vivo studies. 104 Recently, a nine-valent vaccine in HPV (HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) has been proposed for better protection against HPV infection and cervical cancer. 105 If the nine-valent vaccine induces immunity as strong as that of Gardasil \u00ae or Cervarix \u00ae , world incidence rates could be dramatically reduced. 105 In summary, many novel approaches for alternatives of HPV vaccines have been proposed to improve efficacy and reduce costs. Various routes of administration have been tested along with different types of antigen including protein, peptide, DNA, and virus-liked particles. A variety of adjuvants was incorporated with antigen to stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses against HPV infection and cervical cancer.",

In recent years, investigators have focused on using these platforms to improve several aspects of vaccine delivery. Particulate vaccines offer a distinct advantage over antigen solutions themselves. They protect the antigen from the in vivo environment, improve uptake of the antigen, reduce the number of doses for primary immunization, and can be used to target specific cell populations for enhanced efficacy. 108 Several studies in our laboratory have proved the efficacy of oral microparticulate systems to elicit immune response against tumors. [109] [110] [111] The mechanism of immune system activation by the oral route is explained in the earlier section of this chapter. Our laboratory has also explored several targeting ligands that target M cells in order to enhance site-specific uptake of microparticles. Microparticles are formulated using the spray-drying technology with enteric polymers that fall under the Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) category classified by the FDA. Preliminary studies in our laboratory evaluated the efficacy of a microparticulate whole cell lysate vaccine of TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells as a prophylactic cancer vaccine therapy. It was observed that tumor growth was significantly retarded in vaccinated mice compared to the control group. 111 Recently, Chiriva-Internati et al. 112 isolated and tested AKAP-4 as a target for prostate cancer-specific immunotherapy. Our lab is currently exploring the efficacy of therapeutic oral microparticulate vaccines for prostate cancer. Preliminary studies indicate that AKAP-4 along with a whole cell lysate microparticulate vaccine system could efficiently induce antitumor immune responses, leading to a significant reduction in tumor growth in vivo.",

The mucosal route of entry and initiation of primary immune response is well established where pathogens and other invasive microbes enter the host system via regions in the small intestine. Bernadette et al. 128 described a study wherein they formulated a novel prophylactic oral microparticulate vaccine composed of whole cell lysate for melanoma using the spray-drying technique. Surface morphology of microparticles evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the particles had a spherical surface with a size distribution of around 1 to 2 mm (Figure 5.8) . They used an M-cell targeting ligand called aleuria aurantia lectin (ALL) that improved the uptake into the Peyer's patches of the small intestine. The results suggested that melanoma antigen microparticles were able to significantly increase the antibody titers in the mice for groups containing the lectin ligand in comparison to the other groups involved in the study. The serum IgG response of orally immunized mice with AAL ligand in the vaccine was compared with the oral group without I. NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES AAL and showed a significant increase in serum IgG titer. The results of the tumor challenge study showed that the group vaccinated with AAL-associated microparticles showed the highest level of protection against tumor development. Thus, in the future, when designing oral particulate vaccines, AAL may be incorporated in the formulation as the targeting ligand.",

According to the data from the CDC, each year around 20,000 women in the US are diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 15,000 women sadly die each year due to ovarian cancer. The major reason for high mortality is that in more than 70% of women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with advanced disease. 130 Many vaccines have made it to the clinical trials but most of them have not progressed beyond Phase I/II studies. Although antigen-specific responses are obtained using various approaches of immunization, there is a lack of consistency in the benefits. 131, 132 Here, we discuss an oral vaccination with microparticles containing the ovarian cancer antigens that can prevent or retard ovarian cancer growth. A murine ovarian cancer cell line, ID8, was used as a source of antigens as it correlates closely to human ovarian cancer cell lines in signaling pathways and results in development of tumor in mice models similar to human ovarian cancer. 133 Whole cell lysate, which is a very promising approach, provides a pool of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) which include both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells.

Thus, both the subtypes of IgGs indicate that a mixed Th1 and Th2 type response was generated in the vaccine-only group. But, a Th2 type response was triggered among the interleukin group. This difference could be attributed to the effect of interleukins on the Peyer's patches which has been previously reported as a strategy for increasing the immune response for oral vaccine. Similar studies were carried out by Marinaro et al. 135 where IL-12 was given orally to mice immunized with oral tetanus toxoid and cholera toxin.

Another feature of the formulations developed is their sustained-or controlled-release properties achieved by employing different combinations of polymers. This feature can be tailored to achieve desired release profiles by adjusting the compositions of the polymers used. In light of the fact that proteins are very sensitive to any subtle changes in their microenvironment, therefore, the stability of encapsulated proteins must be evaluated. To achieve that, the physicochemical characteristics of the formulations developed were analyzed using bioactivity assays, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), particle sizes analyzers, and the Zetasizer.
