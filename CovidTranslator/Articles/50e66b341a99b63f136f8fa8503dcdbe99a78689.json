Here, we report a feasibility study for producing the nontoxic B subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB) via chloroplast transformation of tobacco. Stable site-specific integration of the LTB gene into chloroplast genome was confirmed by PCR and genomic Southern blot analysis in transformed plants. Immunoblot analysis indicated that plant-derived LTB protein was oligomeric, and dissociated after boiling. Pentameric LTB molecules were the dominant molecular species in LTB isolated from transgenic tobacco leaf tissues. The amount of LTB protein detected in transplastomic tobacco leaf was approximately 2.5% of the total soluble plant protein, approximately 250-fold higher than in plants generated via nuclear transformation. The GM1-ELISA binding assay indicated that chloroplast-synthesized LTB protein bound to GM1-ganglioside receptors. LTB protein with biochemical properties identical to native LTB protein in the chloroplast of edible plants opens the way for inexpensive, safe, and effective plant-based edible vaccines for humans and animals.",

            "text": "The expression and delivery of recombinant protein antigens as edible vaccines is attractive because of the numerous advantages that it offers, such as low production cost, easy administration and storage (Giddings et al., 2000) . The chances of acquiring mucosal immunity against infectious agents that enter the body across a mucosal surface are also increased with edible vaccines (Tacket et al., 1998) . However, the use of subunit vaccines for oral delivery has been resisted * Author for correspondence E-mail: mskyang@moak.chonbuk.ac.kr because of the obvious likelihood of protein degradation in the gut. Recently, transgenic plants have been investigated as an alternative means of producing and delivering vaccines. Indeed, Norwalk virus capsid protein (Tacket et al., 2000) , transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus glycoprotein (Tuboly et al., 2000) , hepatitis B surface protein (Kong et al., 2001) , and foot and mouth disease virus VP1 (Dus Santos et al., 2002) have been successfully expressed in plants. The quantity of plant tissue constituting a vaccine dose must be of a practical size for consumption. However, the level of protein expression achieved in plants is as low as 0.01% and rarely exceeds 0.40% of the total soluble proteins (TSP) (Haq et al., 1995; Gomez et al., 1998; Richter et al., 2001; Mason et al., 2002) . Thus, a high level of expression in plants is critical (Stoger et al., 2002) . A dramatic increase in the recombinant protein yield can be achieved using chloroplast transformation, especially in tobacco, since a leaf cell contains as many as 100 chloroplasts with up to 100 plastid DNA copies each, for a total of approximately 10,000 genome copies per cell. The Bt Cry2Aa2 operon contributed 45.3% of the TSP (De Cosa et al., 2001) and CTB at 4.1% of TSP (Daniell et al., 2001) when they were expressed in tobacco leaf chloroplasts. In other plant chloroplasts, the aadA gene was expressed at 1% of TSP in tomato (Ruf et al., 2001) and 5% of GFP expressed in potato chloroplasts (Sidorov et al., 1999) . Therefore, transgenic plastids are ideal expression factories for high-yield protein production (Bock, 2001) , and it will be possible to express chloroplast transgenes in edible crops, for use as edible vaccines.",

            "text": "Transformation of the plastid genome (plastome) has several more advantages over nuclear transformation. Since plastids in most agronomically important plant species are maternally inherited, field management of transplastomic plants may be simpler, because pollen-mediated outcrossing is not a problem (Daniell et al., 1998; Scott & Wilkinson, 1999; Lutz et al., 2001) . Additionally, multiple genes can be introduced and expressed by polycistronic operon expression in a single plastid transformation event (Staub & Maliga, 1995) . Since the foreign gene is integrated by homologous recombination, the location of transgene insertion is predictable, and there are no position effects, as normally experienced with random insertion of transgenes in nuclear transformation (Svab et al., 1990) . Lastly, gene silencing has not been reported in plastids; therefore, transgene expression is stable in the progeny of transplastomic plants.",

            "text": "Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) causes severe watery diarrhea due to the production of one or more enterotoxins. One of these is a high-molecular weight heat-labile toxin (LT), which is immunologically and physicochemically related to cholera toxin (CT) (Clements & Finkelstein, 1979; Clements et al., 1980) . Each molecule has one 27 kDa A subunit, which has toxic ADP ribosyl transferase activity, and a pentamer of 11.6 kDa B (binding) subunits, which are noncovalently linked into a very stable doughnutlike structure. LT and CT bind via specific interactions of the B subunit pentamer with the GM1-ganglioside present on the intestinal epithelial cell surface. Both heat-labile enterotoxin (LTB) and CTB function as adjuvants for co-administered antigens (Dickinson, 1996; Elson, 1996) as well as immunogens (Clements & Finkelstein, 1978; Gilligan et al., 1983) . When recombinant LTB (rLTB) was expressed in Bacillus brevis and administered intranasally to mice with diphtheria toxoid (D T ), it substantially stimulated production of D T -specific serum IgG antibody and induced moderate D T -specific mucosal IgA antibody responses in the nasal cavity and lung, suggesting that purified rLTB is a promising immuno-adjuvant for mucosal immunizations (Kozuka et al., 2000) . It has been shown that recombinant multimers of the B subunits of LT and CT can be produced successfully in potato and that they are immunogenic when taken orally by animals Lauterslager et al., 2001) and humans (Tacket et al., 1998) . However, LTB formed less than 0.01 and 0.19% of TSP when expressed in the nucleus of tobacco (Haq et al., 1995) and potato (Mason et al., 2001) , respectively. High expression of LTB in plants is necessary for its use as an edible vaccine. This paper reports the efficient high expression of LTB in tobacco chloroplasts and its binding to GM1-ganglioside in order to investigate the functional pentameric structure.",

Primer sets 1F-1R, 3F-3R, and 4F-4R were designed to confirm incorporation of the foreign gene into the chloroplast genome at the directed site by homologous recombination. The rationale for this strategy is that there can be no PCR product unless there is site-specific integration, because one primer binds to the native chloroplast genome adjacent to the point of integration and the second primer to the aadA or LTB gene. In addition, the primer set 2F-2R was used to confirm the integration of the LTB gene in tandem with the aadA gene. Therefore, the PCR products in the DNA of all five independent plants using different primer sets (1.65 kb (1F-1R), 2.8 kb (3F-3R), and 1.7 kb (4F-4R) fragments) confirmed site-specific integration in the chloroplast genome. As expected, there was no PCR product in the wild-type tobacco DNA. The transformed tobacco lines showing sitespecific integration according to the PCR product were further analyzed using Southern blot hybridization to verify site-specific integration and to establish copy number. In the chloroplast genome, there are BglII sites upstream from the 16S rRNA gene and downstream from the trnA region, which generate a 4.47 kb fragment when digested with BglII. A transformed chloroplast genome has a foreign gene cassette inserted between the trnI and trnA regions, which increases the size of the BglII fragment to 6.17 kb. Total DNA from each clone and wild-type tobacco were digested with BglII, and the blot was hybridized with a trnI-trnA probe (0.81 kb) labeled with 32 P-dCTP using a DNA labeling system (Prime-a-Gene Labeling System, Promega). The tissue transformed with pMY-CH-LTB showed the expected 6.17 kb fragments, reflecting the presence of the transgene (Figure 2) . The 4.47 kb fragment was found in the wild-type plant, which does not contain a transgene. In transgenic plants, the 4.47 kb fragment was not found, suggest-ing that homoplastomy has been achieved. From this result, it is assumed that genetic stability of transplastomic plants requires homoplastomy .",

Based on the absorbance measurement used to determine GM1 binding, the LTB protein expression by the two transplastomic plant lines was also very similar. The strong binding efficiencies of plant LTB for GM1 indicate that plant-derived LTB subunit binding to GM1 is cooperative (Schon & Freire, 1989; Merritt et al., 1994 ).",

(1998) fed the transformed potato plants to mice, and found that the LTB in potato tubers stimulated strong serum and mucosal antibody responses against LTB and provided partial protection against oral challenge with LT. Therefore, they demonstrated that the LTB expressed in plants has the potential to be used as an edible vaccine. The production of oligomeric LTB protein in edible plants may induce mucosal and systemic antibodies in mammals at levels sufficient to provide protective immunity against an ETEC challenge after feeding on transgenic plant tissues. It has been reported that the production of LTB in transgenic potato tubers at the level of 0.01% of TSP is sufficient to elicit both systemic and mucosal antibody production in mice, demonstrating the in vitro toxin-neutralization capability of oral immunization (Haq et al., 1995) . However, it may be desirable to increase antigen expression levels to create more effective plant-based oral vaccines for larger animals and humans.",

The chloroplast-synthesized CTB bound to the intestinal membrane GM1-ganglioside receptor, indicating correct folding and disulfide bond formation of CTB pentamers. Another protein that has been expressed in tobacco chloroplasts is human somatotropin (hST), which is used clinically; hST contributed more than 7% of TSP and was expressed in a biologically active, disulfide-bonded form in tobacco chloroplasts (Staub et al., 2000) .",

Moreover, the expression level may be underestimated, because the band larger than 45 kDa seen in the Western blot analysis (Figure 3(A) ) results from aggregates of oligomers in plant extracts (Daniell et al., 2001) . The chloroplast-synthesized LTB showed a strong affinity for GM1-ganglioside, suggesting that the LTB conserved the antigenic sites for binding and proper folding of pentameric LTB structure. This proves the feasibility of using plastids to express pharmaceutically useful proteins. The LTB expression in the tobacco chloroplasts did not affect growth rates, flowering or seed setting, and we could not morphologically distinguish between the transplastomic and wild-type plants in the greenhouse. This result agrees with the previous report (Daniell et al., 2001) in which transplastomic tobacco plants expressing CTB gene had no pleiotropic effects compared to wild-type plants.",
