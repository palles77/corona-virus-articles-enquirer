The goal was to estimate net income and losses (nationally, and by hospital type) of a response of filling unused hospital bed capacity proportionately and postponing elective admissions (a \"passive\" supply response). Methods. Epidemiologic assumptions were combined with assumptions from other literature (e.g., staff absenteeism, profitability by payer class), Census data on age groups by region, and baseline hospital utilization data. Hospital discharge records were available from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Hospital bed capacity and staffing were measured with the American Hospital Association's (AHA) Annual Survey. Results. Nationwide, in a scenario of relatively severe epidemiologic assumptions, we estimated aggregate net income of $119 million for about 1 million additional influenza-related admissions, and a net loss of $37 million for 52,000 postponed elective admissions. Implications. Aggregate and distributional results did not suggest that a policy of promising additional financial compensation to hospitals in anticipation of the surge in flu cases was necessary. The analysis identified needs for better information of several types to improve simulations of hospital behavior and impacts during demand surges.",

Those models and new parametric assumptions in 2009 generated a range of estimates for infection in a given region along with the implied levels of demand for care that exceeded normal utilization of hospital resources (U.S. Centers for Disease Control [CDC] 2011a,b) . The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential financial impacts of the predicted demand surge on hospitals of various kinds. Two outcomes of interest were projected: net income (or loss) from additional influenza cases accepted and losses from postponing profitable elective admissions.",

Meltzer, Cox, and Fukuda (1999) estimated economic impact of vaccination-based interventions to support priority setting. They estimated the age distribution of those infected and the rates of hospitalization by age, based on experience in three pandemics in the 20th century. The U.S. Health and Human Services Pandemic Influenza Plan (2006) recommended that hospitals defer elective admissions to increase their capacity to treat influenza patients in the event of a surge in demand. However, there were neither specific regulations in place to enforce that recommendation nor a plan for financial incentives to encourage or facilitate it. Lim et al. (2004) and Wu, Yang, and Wu (2004) found that deferrals of elective admissions during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viral outbreaks in Toronto and Taiwan, respectively, resulted in hospitals losing net revenue, at least in the short term. Matheny, Toner, and Waldhorn (2007) estimated that an influenza outbreak in the United States similar to the one that occurred in 1918 could result in an \"average\" hospital losing more than $350,000 because of deferred cases and increases in uncompensated care. Questions could be raised about the assumptions of that study, which, as we note below, highlights the importance of continued research on the capacity of the U.S. health care system and the likely response of different health care \"actors\" (e.g., hospitals, physicians, nurses, and payers) to disasters and other surge events.",

However, hospitals differ in baseline capacity and staffing, occupancy rate, the flow of elective admissions, diagnostic case mix, and payer mix. Hospitals of any particular size or type that are already operating at a relatively high capacity utilization would not be as easily able to accept a surge of new cases as would other hospitals in their peer group. Microsimulation models can find a new market solution for all hospitals and the population according to some equilibrium criterion, despite substantial variety in hospital types, capacities, and baseline conditions. Microsimulation is appropriate when individual actors can behave differently, but their combined responses generate feedback loops that affect all actors. An iterative method can be designed to find a new equilibrium for each market or regional area.",

Specifically, this is defined as a proportional response by each hospital to meeting the area's excess demand, depending on the hospital's unused capacity plus capacity freed up by postponing elective admissions. Some hospitals could reach an upper limit on feasible utilization. (That idiosyncratic limit is unknown to the analyst and must be assumed.) For a large enough increase in demand, the entire area may use up its total available capacity and therefore special arrangements would have to be made for treatment outside of the usual sources of acute care (and thus outside of the model for this analysis). Indeed, in the case of the 2009 H1N1 epidemic, alternative sites of care were under active consideration by a federal interagency group, the Council on Emergency Medical Care, representing the relevant civilian and defense departments. For this analysis, we used an iterative model to spread excess hospital demand in a proportional manner during each iteration, subject to constraints. If every hospital postponed elective admissions in the assumed way, then after the surge, each hospital would presumably be able to admit the patients it deferred. However, there would also be a temptation for a hospital to act as a \"free rider\" by not postponing elective admissions and even proceeding to accept elective admissions that were postponed at other hospitals. No attempt to prevent free riders was assumed in our model. If the simulated results on net financial impact under a range of the assumptions in the simulation were found to be modest, then a potentially costly compensation program to discourage free riders-with possible problems of its own-could be avoided.",

The NIS sample is designed to be a 20 percent stratified sample of U.S. acute care, community hospitals, retaining all discharges of each sampled hospital. The strata for random sampling are defined by Census region, hospital bed size, urban/rural location, teaching status, and ownership/control of the hospital (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 2009a).

For each Census region and hospital type, we first estimated a potential reduction in usable bed capacity based on staff absenteeism. Then we calculated the percentage increase in new cases (demand) for the region. Then the proportional assignment of patients to a hospital was calculated based on its share of unused bed capacity plus elective admissions. That comprised the first-round assignment of patient encounters to hospitals. During the first round, some patients may not be placed in hospitals and some hospitals may reach their usable inpatient capacity limit. All unplaced patients from the first round were then assigned in a second round to those hospitals with remaining capacity. The series of assignments then proceeded iteratively until either all patients were placed, or all hospitals were at capacity with some patients unplaced. We assumed that if there were unplaced cases at the end, they would be cared for, but at alternative sites of care outside community hospitals. For each hospital, the payer and cost of influenza cases accepted, and elective cases postponed, determined the estimated short-term profit or loss impact of H1N1 for that hospital. Financial impact was aggregated by hospital type within region, as well as nationally.",

But a hospital could eventually reach its lower limit constraint on unused capacity, Z h , with no remaining postponable elective admissions. At the end of the first-round calculation, the sum of all cases that could not be accepted by their first hospital, divided by the remaining total capacity was R 2 . The second round of calculations applied the R 2 proportion to the available capacity of each hospital with remaining capacity. Again, if some hospitals could not accept their assigned cases, the process continued with a third round and so forth. Eventually, either all flu cases for the region were assigned to a hospital, or all hospitals reached their constraint on capacity utilization with some flu patients unassigned to a hospital. At this new equilibrium, for each hospital the number of flu cases was known, the number of postponed elective admissions was known, the cost of such cases was known in 2007 dollars, and the payer mix for elective and for flu patients at the hospital was known. Therefore, for each hospital the net income or loss from additional flu patients, and the losses from postponed elective patients could be calculated. Table 1 provides some baseline national data to illustrate key variables that play a role in the simulations. The actual data in the simulations were at the regional or individual hospital level. Section (a) of the table illustrates occupancy rates of acute care, community hospitals by hospital type. It is clear from the occupancy rates that, on average, there was a substantial amount of unused inpatient capacity in the U.S. health care system, and also that the two categories of larger hospitals tended to run at higher occupancy ratios. Section (b) of the table shows how much of the baseline occupancy was utilized for elective admissions-between one fifth and one third of total occupied capacity for all but the smallest hospitals. An examination of these cases revealed that 56 percent were nonemergency admissions with major procedures using the operating rooms (e.g., spine and disc procedures, hip or knee joint replacements, coronary artery bypass or angioplasty procedures, hysterectomy, insertion of pacemaker, open prostatectomy, etc.). Another 24 percent of these admissions involved minor therapeutic or diagnostic procedures, and 16 percent were medical, not involving therapeutic or diagnostic intervention codes. The classification of major or minor procedures used the diagnosisrelated group for the case, with software downloadable from the HCUP User Support website.",

Section (d) provides data on the payer breakdown for elective and flu cases. Interestingly, the proportion of uninsured inpatient cases was not much greater for flu cases than for elective admissions. Elective cases were much less likely to be Medicaid beneficiaries who tend to generate losses. Profitability by payer, together with the average cost of different types of admissions at a particular hospital, determined the calculated net income or losses for individual hospitals. Table 2 shows that a high percentage of absenteeism could potentially decide which hospitals would have to postpone more elective admissions to accept the proportional burden of new flu cases. With a 20 percent reduction in FTE staff, the average FTE/bed in each category would not be brought down to the previous lower cutoff point. Of course, with a skewed distribution of FTE/bed the behavior of the average might not show that a substantial number of hospitals would be brought down to the cutoff point and their number of usable beds would fall. Clearly, with a 40 percent reduction, a hospital at the previous average of FTE/bed would have to make a substantial reduction in usable beds.

The largest increases in occupancy were projected for medium-sized hospitals and large nonteaching hospitals.

Therefore, other simulation runs were not reported. The results in Table 3 from a national perspective can be linked to several key influences and assumptions. First, the increase in number of flu cases, driven by national epidemiologic assumptions, represented only a 2.9 percent increase in total admissions demanded compared with baseline. This was not large in relation to the unused bed occupancy in the medium size, and large, nonteaching hospitals combined (Table 1) . Second, the net income percentage over cost for any patient depended only on the patient's payer. Additional influenza patients were more likely to be Medicaid patients than were elective cases, but Medicaid and self-pay were together only about one third of the extra flu cases and therefore did not result in an overall loss for flu patients. Clearly from section (d) of Table 1 , flu patients were less profitable than elective cases that were postponed, but they did generate a positive net income on average and relatively few elective cases were postponed. There were a number of substantial limitations in this microsimulation that must be highlighted. In most cases they represent a challenge for better data resources and research on decision making in hospitals. One fundamental issue is the accurate measurement of capacity. The acute care bed capacity measured by AHA attempts to capture beds that are \"set up\" and usable, but the counts give rise to occupancy rates that are suspiciously low. If it is possible that the bed count is accurate, patients in a semiprivate room greatly appreciate the other bed being usually empty. However, is there actually sufficient staff readily available for handling patients in both beds, or do hospitals plan to raise and lower staff overtime and temporary staffing flexibly with occupancy? In the latter case, the marginal cost of additional occupants could be greater than the baseline average cost per case.",

If a higher percentile cutoff was used, more beds would have been removed from available capacity and more elective admissions would have been postponed.

It is reasonable to suppose that hospitals with fewer ICU beds, regardless of total unused routine beds, would be constrained to accept fewer flu cases and would postpone more elective surgeries. The use of ICU beds was not measurable for hospitals in many of the states participating in HCUP. We were able to examine ICU utilization data for a dozen states which collect standardized detailed charge information for each hospital stay. An investigation of data on ICU bed utilization compared with data on ICU capacity from the AHA did not yield plausible baseline occupancy rates (the results were too low).

There was no quantitative evidence on this managerial issue. Our advice from a small number of experts was to expect a highly nonlinear response, that is, that available beds would have to be very low before any elective cases would be deferred. Therefore, we set the trigger at a fairly low percentile of unused capacity. For example, in the category of large, nonteaching hospitals, the 10th percentile cutoff of unused capacity implies 17 percent of total capacity (data not presented above). This is similar to the average occupancy rate for elective cases, shown for that category in section (b) of Table 1 . A lower trigger could be argued on the basis of the advice we received. A higher trigger could result in somewhat more postponement of elective admissions. However, in view of the high unused capacity in relation to the 2.9 percent increase in admissions, the higher trigger would likely make little difference in the current results. Some emergency planners would make assumptions sensitive to the etiology and duration of demand surge (i.e., no notice, short term, long term, localized vs. widespread geographic impact).

The study exposed numerous challenges related to lack of information in the literature on hospital response to surge-notably, the likely responses to absenteeism during an epidemic, special capacity constraints for resources such as intensive care beds, levels of occupancy at which elective admissions would be postponed, and cost increases to meet a demand surge. Illustrative results of a relatively severe scenario did not support an argument for promising some kind of compensation for losses incurred, and such payment policies were not adopted. of the authors and do not reflect the policies of federal or state governments or private associations supplying data used in the study.",
