Although the study of ribavirin as an antiviral drug has been justly focused its effects on the virus, an important set of recent studies examined how host cells may react to RBV exposure. One study revealed dramatic variations in the accumulation of RBV in seven different cell lines [15 ] . The authors showed that while uptake of RBV by the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1 and 2) is similar for all cell types, the levels of intracellular RBV in seemingly resistant cells like BHK21, A549 and Vero are noticeably lower than those in BSRT7, HeLa, 4T1 or HEp2. Importantly, these profiles correlate with the lack of antiviral efficacy against VSV and Sendai virus. The authors concluded that the ability of a given cell type to metabolize RBV may determine which of RBV's antiviral effects will be at play. In the case of the hCoV-EMC coronavirus, a lack of sensitivity to interferon-a2b and RBV is also observed in Vero cells, while LLC-MK2 cells are more responsive [16 ] . Interestingly, RBV-responsive Huh7.5 cells passaged in the presence of ribavirin develop resistance phenotypes that correlate with reduced RBV uptake and/or processing. Furthermore, reduced uptake develops in PBMC of healthy donors treated for 1 week with RBV, and in the PBMC of HCVinfected patients receiving ribavirin-interferon combination therapy [17 ] .",

Although the study of ribavirin as an antiviral drug has been justly focused its effects on the virus, an important set of recent studies examined how host cells may react to RBV exposure. One study revealed dramatic variations in the accumulation of RBV in seven different cell lines [15 ] . The authors showed that while uptake of RBV by the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1 and 2) is similar for all cell types, the levels of intracellular RBV in seemingly resistant cells like BHK21, A549 and Vero are noticeably lower than those in BSRT7, HeLa, 4T1 or HEp2. Importantly, these profiles correlate with the lack of antiviral efficacy against VSV and Sendai virus. The authors concluded that the ability of a given cell type to metabolize RBV may determine which of RBV's antiviral effects will be at play. In the case of the hCoV-EMC coronavirus, a lack of sensitivity to interferon-a2b and RBV is also observed in Vero cells, while LLC-MK2 cells are more responsive [16 ] . Interestingly, RBV-responsive Huh7.5 cells passaged in the presence of ribavirin develop resistance phenotypes that correlate with reduced RBV uptake and/or processing. Furthermore, reduced uptake develops in PBMC of healthy donors treated for 1 week with RBV, and in the PBMC of HCVinfected patients receiving ribavirin-interferon combination therapy [17 ] .",

A lack of clear and direct inhibitory/mutagenic effects of RBV on HCV in vivo is thought to be a question of physiological concentrations of the drug or an issue of sampling the wrong compartment (blood versus liver). However, in recent studies, RBV was found to induce significantly more G-to-A and C-to-U transitions, a genetic signature that is indicative of ribavirin-induced mutagenesis [25 ,26] . Whether the effect is sufficiently strong to be of benefit is not yet determined. For other clinical infections, RBV monotherapy remains the treatment of choice. For example, in transplant patients treated for hepatitis E infection, RBV therapy ensures a sustained virologic response in most patients as a firstline, or as a second and prolonged, therapy [27] . It is also a well-tolerated option to treat respiratory syncytial virus infections in immunocompromised patients [28] . As the only antiviral treatment against Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, it appears to be beneficial when administrated early, with decreased severity and fatality rates [29] . In a preliminary study, combination treatment was also shown to be effective against rhinovirus (RV) in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, who are more susceptible to RV infections [30] . To explore an intervention strategy for the recently identified b coronavirus isolate hCoV-EMC/2012, treatment of rhesus macaques with RBV alone reduced virus replication. In combination with interferon-a2b, treatment was even more effective and permitted lower doses that are in line with clinical use [31] . Finally, RBV was shown to have protective potential against lethal hantavirus pulmonary syndrome after intranasal exposure of hamsters to Andes Virus, where the presence of live virus was reduced or abolished in serum [32] .",

For HCV, ribavirin resistant mutations in the NS5A protein were first described using a replicon system [40] . More recently, resistant populations were isolated by serially passaging J6/JFH1 virus in RBV, which present dozens of mutations throughout the genome that could be responsible, including in the RdRp, but the precise determinant is not known [41] .

A dozen variants in different residue positions of Coxsackie virus B3 polymerase, and several variants of the same RdRp residue of chikungunya and Sindbis virus, are more sensitive to base analog mutagens because of their reduced polymerase fidelity, further confirming the mutagenic affect of RBV on RNA viruses [37,46 ,47] . In the case of coronaviruses (CoV) a hyper-sensitive ExoN-mutant has generated interesting data in recent years. Given that coronaviruses have the largest RNA genomes, they would expectedly be hyper-sensitive to RNA mutagens such as RBV;",

It appears that in many cases, this pleiotropic compound is simply being true to its pleiotropic nature. A significant recent advance, and complication, toward this goal is the variability observed between cell types and tissues in RBV uptake and metabolism, that could impact the efficacy of a drug being administered with one mechanism in mind, while another mechanism is ultimately at work. Future research requires a better validation of these mechanisms depending on the cell system used, especially in the case of HCV.",
