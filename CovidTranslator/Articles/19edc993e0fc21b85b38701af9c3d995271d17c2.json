Lethargy , anorexia, depression, dehydration, vomiting, and diarrhea are the most common signs. 1. The most severe clinical signs are seen in dogs <4 months of age because of their lack of protective immunity and increased number of rapidly dividing cells. 2. The clinical course ranges from 4 to 7 days. C. Diarrhea is often profuse and hemorrhagic, and vomiting may be intractable. D. Fever and leucopenia are common initially, but hypothermia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and endotoxic shock occur terminally with septicemia, which may develop within 48 hours in a fulminant infection. E. Certain breeds have increased susceptibility, including the rottweiler, Doberman pinscher, American pit bull terrier, German shepherd dog, Labrador retriever, and Alaskan sled dog breeds. F. Most adult dogs infected with parvovirus have subclinical disease. G. Puppies infected in utero or perinatally (<8 weeks) can develop myocarditis that may progress to cardiomyopathy and sudden death. H. Other complications include thrombosis (from DIC), erythema multiforme, hypoglycemia, and septicemia. II. Canine coronavirus A. Infection is via the fecal-oral route, signs are uncommon in adult dogs, and they are generally mild and selflimiting in weanling puppies.",

B. When submitting bacterial cultures of fecal material, submit individual samples in media appropriate for each organism suspected. 1. Diagnosis of campylobacteriosis is best made by culture of the organism from fresh feces placed into anaerobic transport media. 2. Diagnosis of salmonellosis is best made by culturing the organism; however, caution is advised, as Salmonella spp. are isolated from healthy dogs without diarrhea. C. The signifi cance of culture results is based on the signalment, history, other test results for viral and parasitic agents, histopathology (if the diarrhea is chronic), and presence of toxin (if it is a toxin-secreting species). D. Defi nitive diagnosis of C. perfringens is diffi cult because detection of endospores (fecal cytology), toxin formation (by ELISA), or the gene for clostridial enterotoxin production (by PCR) are all associated with falsepositive and false-negative results. 1. Presumptive diagnosis is made by increased numbers of spores or a positive fecal enterotoxin in the presence of diarrhea. 2. The best way to diagnose clostridial diarrhea is fi nding clostridial enterotoxin in feces by ELISA or PCR, in a dog with acute diarrhea (Marks and Kather, 2003) . E. Identifi cation of pathogenic E. coli requires either specifi c typing for known pathogenic strains or demonstration of toxin production. III. Bacterial enteritis may occur secondary to viral infection (e.g., parvovirus). IV. Toxin assays are available for identifi cation of the presence of toxin in fecal material from C. diffi cile, C. perfringens, and certain E. coli, and are used to determine whether these organisms are responsible for the clinical signs. V. Fecal cytology helps identify the type of enteritis (presence of infl ammatory cells, type of cells, number and type of bacteria), determine its severity (presence or absence of RBCs, epithelial cells, leukocytes), and in some cases identifi es the cause (e.g., seagull-shaped bacteria characteristic of Campylobacter or Helicobacter spp. H.

Perform multiple fecal fl otations (more than three) using different fl otation media (salt, sugar, zinc sulfate [ZnSO 4 ]), and different methods (direct examination, cytology of fecal smears, Baermann's). 1.

Diarrhea caused by clostridial overgrowth and enterotoxin production is suggested by fi nding enterotoxin in the feces using an ELISA assay (Marks and Kather, 2003) . 3. Cryptosporidia spp. are diffi cult to identify because their extremely small oocysts require special microscopy, so an assay for the toxin is the best diagnostic approach. 4.

            "text": "A. Trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) 1. The TLI assay is a species-specifi c assay for the pancreatic acinar cell enzymes, trypsinogen and trypsin. 2. Normal serum TLI of dogs is 5.2 to 35 mg/L and of cats is 12 to 82 mg/L. 3. Serum TLI is unaffected by small intestinal disease, but is markedly low in dogs or cats with exocrine pancreatic insuffi ciency. 4. Elevated levels correlate poorly in dogs and only moderately well in cats with acute pancreatitis. 5. Serum is collected following a fast for 6 to 12 hours. B. Serum vitamin concentrations (folate and cobalamin) 1. Decreased levels of folate occur with severe proximal or diffuse small intestinal disease. 2. Increased folate levels are observed in animals on parenteral supplementation, and in dogs with exocrine pancreatic insuffi ciency or with antibiotic responsive enteritis. 3. Increased levels of folate are also present in hemolyzed blood samples from leakage of the vitamin from RBCs. 4. A cobalamin defi ciency refl ects ileal disease, exocrine pancreatic insuffi ciency, or may occur in the presence of antibiotic responsive enteritis (dogs). 5. Elevated levels of cobalamin have unknown clinical signifi cance, but may occur with excess parenteral supplementation. 6. Assays for both cobalamin and folate must be validated and normal values established for each species. a. Samples are collected after a 6-to 12-hour fast and stored in darkness, because cobalamin is light sensitive. b. Because serum vitamin concentrations can be low in animals with both exocrine pancreatic insuffi ciency and small intestinal disease, simultaneous serum TLI assay is recommended. 7. Cats may be more susceptible to cobalamin defi ciency because of their increased need for cobalamin. C. Measurements of intestinal permeability 1. Tests of intestinal permeability are used to noninvasively determine the presence of intestinal mucosal damage from gluten enteropathy, acute gastroenteritis, IBD, neoplasia, and other diseases. 2. The standard test uses the probe 51 Cr-labeled EDTA; however, the marker is not suitable for use in private clinical practice or many referral practices. 3. Other tests use two sugars, one disaccharide (cellobiose, lactulose) and one monosaccharide (mannitol, rhamnose) to determine intestinal permeability by measuring the amount excreted in urine and expression of the results as a ratio. D. d-Xylose absorption test 1. It has a very low sensitivity for small intestinal disease. 2. It is impractical and cumbersome to perform in most clinical settings and is not recommended. E. Tests for antibiotic responsive enteritis (previously referred to as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) 1. Increased serum folate and decreased serum cobalamin levels are suggestive but not specifi c for the problem. 2. Serum unconjugated bile acids increase 10 to 20 times in affected dogs, but an assay is not yet commercially available. 3. At this time, the best diagnostic test is culture of intestinal contents to quantitate bacterial numbers, and isolate known or potential pathogens. a. Recent evidence indicates that this method is inadequate for identifi cation of bacterial numbers and species in the intestinal tract (Suchodolski et al., 2005) . b. DNA technology may be the most reliable and accurate means of identifying and enumerating the wide variety of bacterial species colonizing the intestinal tract, but is only available at research laboratories. IV. Imaging studies are indicated, but may give nonspecifi c results and are used to rule out other diseases. A. Survey abdominal radiography is often normal. B. Upper GI contrast studies may reveal foreign bodies, masses, intestinal obstruction or intussusception, and gastric or intestinal ulcers (see Chapter 4). C. Abdominal ultrasonography is used to detect changes in echogenicity of abdominal organs and bowel thickness or irregularities, for identifying lymphadenopathy or other intraabdominal masses, and for obtaining biopsies and aspirates. V. Endoscopic examination permits direct visualization of the mucosa and provides an opportunity to obtain multiple samples for cytology, biopsy, and culture. A. In animals with weight loss or chronic diarrhea, samples for biopsy are obtained from multiple sites (stomach, duodenum, ileum, colon). B. Properly obtained biopsies include submucosa and intact mucosa in the proper orientation (i.e., carefully uncurled and lying fl at on a biopsy sponge to maintain orientation).",

When identifi ed, correct the primary cause of the enteropathy (i.e., administer immunosuppressive therapy for IBD and lipogranulomatous lymphangitis or antifungal therapy for histoplasmosis). II. The most important aspect of dietary therapy is to feed a low-fat, highly digestible diet to minimize fat malabsorption and lymphatic leakage (Zoran, 2003) . A. A homemade diet is often the best choice for dogs with severe PLE that have a selective appetite, because it can be formulated to include ultra-low-fat content, novel protein, and highly digestible carbohydrate sources. 1. One example consists of no-fat cottage cheese, egg whites, or turkey breast as the protein sources, and boiled potatoes (without the skins) or well-cooked white rice as the carbohydrate sources. 2. Initially, no other fat source is added, but eventually, a small amount of oil (corn oil) must be added to provide essential fatty acids in the diet. B. Commercially available, ultra-low-fat (<3 g/100 kcal fat) diets may be adequate in less severe cases. 1. The lowest fat, commercially available diet that is not also a high-fi ber diet is Royal Canin Low Fat. 2. Hydrolyzed diets also may be well tolerated, but they are not all low in fat. 3. Purina Veterinary Diets H/A has the lowest fat content of the commercially available hydrolyzed diets. C. In dogs that are unable to eat (vomiting, severe diarrhea) nutritional support via total parenteral or partial parenteral nutrition may be needed, especially in dogs that are severely cachetic and edematous. D. If hypoproteinemia is severe, but the animal is able to eat, low-fat elemental diets (e.g., Vivonex) may be used instead of or in addition to commercial diets.",

Unvaccinated kittens with peracute infection have a high morbidity and mortality rate from severe leukopenia and anemia, and may be found dehydrated, hypothermic, and comatose within 12 hours of onset.VI. Feline enteric coronavirus (FEC) and FIP virusA. Infections with enteric coronavirus are most often subclinical, especially in adult cats, but may cause mild, self-limiting diarrhea and fever in young or immunocompromised cats. B. Clinically apparent FEC infections are most common in kittens 4 to 12 weeks of age. C. FEC is nearly ubiquitous, especially in colonies, and inapparent infection is common. D. Clinical signs in cats infected with FIP virus are Both dogs and cats exhibit a neutrophilia during the recovery phase. B. Distemper virus in dogs causes leukopenia from lymphopenia.1. Blood smears may show reactive lymphocytes and occasionally viral inclusion bodies in red blood cells (RBCs) or neutrophils. 2. Thrombocytopenia may also occur, but varies in intensity. C. CCV, FEC, rotavirus, and other enteric viruses do not usually cause signifi cant changes in the hemogram. D. FIP is usually associated with a nonregenerative ane-",

Finding Clostridium spp. spores (safety pin-shaped organisms) in large numbers (>5 per high-power fi eld) is not an important consideration in the diagnosis of clostridial enterocolitis. B. The mere presence of spores does not indicate they are secreting toxin and causing the diarrhea (Marks and Kather, 2003). VI. Hematological or biochemical changes may be nonspecifi c; however, signifi cant leukocytosis or leukopenia is suggestive of bacterial causes. VII. In dogs or cats with diseases of high mortality (e.g., hemorrhagic colibacillosis, salmonellosis, Tyzzer's disease), diagnosis is often based on postmortem examination. Diagnosis I. Viral enteritis: especially in puppies and kittens II. Severe intestinal parasitism in puppies in and kittens III. Toxin-induced enteritis IV. Dietary indiscretion and other nonspecifi c enteritis V. Extraintestinal causes of diarrhea Treatment and Monitoring I. Supportive care is essential to replace lost fl uids and electrolytes, and to correct acid-base disturbances from moderate to severe diarrhea. A. In animals that are not vomiting and have only mild signs, oral replacement fl uid therapy is usually adequate (see Viral Infections earlier in this chapter). B. If vomiting is present, institute appropriate IV fl uid therapy. C. Do not use motility-modifying agents, because re moval of the bacterial toxins and infl ammatory mediators is enhanced by the diarrhea. D. Intestinal protectants are occasionally benefi cial in dogs with mild disease to decrease effects of the toxins and reduce infl ammation. 1. Consider bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) at 1 to 2 mL/kg PO TID to QID. 2. Pepto-Bismol is not recommended in cats owing to the risk of salicylate toxicity. II. Antibiotic therapy is indicated, especially if the pathogen is defi nitively identifi ed; however, antibacterial therapy is controversial for animals with Campylobacter spp. or Salmonella spp. infections when there are no systemic signs of disease. A. Give ampicillin 10 to 22 mg/kg IM, SC, or IV TID to QID for Salmonella spp., or Clostridium spp. infections. B. Administer amikacin 6 to 8 mg/kg IM, IV SID alone for Salmonella spp., Helicobacter spp., Yersinia spp., and Campylobacter spp. infections, or in combination with cephalothin for systemic salmonellosis. C. Use trimethoprim-sulfadiazine 15 mg/kg SC, PO BID for elimination of salmonella carrier states and treatment of yersiniosis. D. Give erythromycin 20 mg/kg PO BID (dogs) and 10 mg/kg PO TID (cats) for Campylobacter spp. and Helicobacter spp. infections. E. Substitute, if necessary, newer generation macrolides,such as azithromycin (5 mg/kg PO SID) for erythromycin (fewer side effects). F. Clindamycin 5 to10 mg/kg PO BID may also be effective against Clostridium spp. G. Metronidazole at 5 to 15 mg/kg PO BID is used for bacterial overgrowth and clostridial enterocolitis.",

These include Pythium insidiosum, Lagenidium spp., other Zygomycetes, and Prototheca zopfi i (Grooters, 2003). B. P. insidiosum is a water-borne pathogen belonging to the class Oomycetes that causes cutaneous or GI disease in tropical or subtropical regions. C. Pythiosis is more common in dogs than in cats and causes only cutaneous infections in cats. D. Lagenidiosis is primarily observed in dogs and is associated with cutaneous disease unless it becomes disseminated and systemic signs develop. E. The primary zygomycosis associated with GI disease in dogs or cats is mucormycosis caused by Mucor spp., Rhizopus spp., or Absidia spp. F. Prototheca zopfi i is a blue-green algae capable of causing GI and other organ disease in dogs. III. Candida albicans: opportunistic infection IV. Aspergillus spp. A. GI involvement is part of disseminated disease. B. It is a rare disease and is more common in dogs (especially German shepherd dogs) than in cats. Pathophysiology I. H. capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus, having both infective and tissue stages. A. The free-living mycelial stages (macroconidia and microconidia) live in the soil and are the source of infection. B. Once in the body, microconidia are converted into the yeast form in the tissues, are then engulfed by macrophages, and initiate intracellular replication. II. Pythiosis is the most clinically important miscellaneous organism.A. Pythium spp. differ from true fungi in producing motile, fl agellate zoospores, and having cell walls that contain cellulose, no chitin, and very little ergosterol. B. The infective stage is released into warm water environments and likely causes infection by encysting in the GI mucosa. C. Pythiosis causes granulomatous infl ammatory lesions that may form masses and obstruct the GI tract, or may cause diffuse infi ltrative granulomatous enteritis. D. Lesions are most frequently observed in the stomach and duodenum, but may involve any segment of the small intestine, with the ileocolic junction another common location. III. Lagenidium spp. infections typically cause cutaneous or subcutaneous draining nodules in dogs, but the disease may disseminate to other body systems. IV. Candida spp. invade and proliferate in the GI tract following prolonged antibiotic therapy, or when the normal GI fl ora are altered by disease or dysfunction. V. Disseminated aspergillosis may infi ltrate the small intestine, but only when there is severe immunodefi ciency or immunosuppression. Signs I. Histoplasmosis A. Chronic weight loss, anorexia, and large bowel diarrhea(tenesmus, hematochezia, mucus, urgency)  are the most common clinical signs in dogs with primary GI histoplasmosis. B. With small intestinal involvement, the diarrhea is either profuse and watery or bloody. C. With systemic involvement, fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, icterus, anemia, ascites, cough, and dyspnea are often observed. D. Histoplasmosis is more common in young (<4 years) Infections are more common in male, large-breed dogs living in tropical or subtropical regions. C. Cutaneous forms of pythiosis are less common than GI forms in dogs, but skin disease is more common in cats. D. Signs of systemic illness can occur with pythiosis, but only after development of intestinal obstruction or perforation.",
