The cost and risk of R&D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vaccines in the event of an outbreak.",

New threats persist, including the recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus COVID-19 emerging from Wuhan, China (4) Government leaders face formidable decisions about the provision of health security measures against outbreaks of these threats. Global actors are seeking to diminish the danger that these pathogens pose to the wellbeing of nations, regions, and the world. Given the range of potential biological threats, their unpredictability, and the limited resources available to address them, policymakers must necessarily prioritize their readiness efforts based on limited knowledge. All too often, they are forced to choose between priorities, and construct so-called limited lists of treatments, using testimony from teams of experts to inform these decisions. As history has shown, however, this approach leaves society vulnerable to unforeseen outbreaks. Therefore, a more rational approach is to develop a broad portfolio of vaccines in a coordinated manner, mitigating the future risk posed by unpredictable outbreaks of these diseases.",

            "text": "As the world becomes more globalized, urbanized, and exposed to the effects of climate change, the danger of infectious diseases has become an even greater concern (9), as emerging and re-emerging strains become more diverse, and outbreaks become more frequent. While distinct from the emerging infectious diseases, influenza serves as the best example of the destruction that viruses with pandemic potential can inflict on the modern world. As a baseline, avian influenza outbreaks in the U.S. since late 2014 have caused economy-wide losses estimated at $3.3 billion domestically, and have significantly disrupted trade (10) . The 1918 influenza pandemic, however, is estimated to have infected 500 million people and killed 3-5% of the world's population. In 2006, Dr. Larry Brilliant stated that 90% of the epidemiologists in his confidence agreed that there would be a large influenza pandemic within two generations, in which 1 billion people would sicken, 165 million would die, and the global economy would lose $1 to $3 trillion (11) (see Supplementary Materials for further discussion). Controlling EIDs before they have the chance to reach comparable scale represents a significant opportunity to prevent similar loss. few economic incentives for manufacturers to develop preventative vaccines for EIDs, due to the high costs of R&D and the uncertain future demand. Even if protection against these emerging diseases were immediately achievable with existing technology, development costs are significant (12) , as they are for any pharmaceutical development program. Pronker et al. (13) estimate that it costs between $200-900 million for a new vaccine to be created. Failure to gain approval also poses a substantial risk, as successful passage through clinical trials only occurs 6-11% of the time (13, 14) . Regulatory challenges are particularly prominent in EID vaccine development, as viable candidates are rarely available for distribution during outbreaks, making safety and efficacy testing difficult. As a result, vaccine development for EIDs has been reactive and technologically conservative (15) .",

These assets subsequently serve as collateral, and their future cash flows service the debt incurred to acquire them, paying the interest and principal of the issued bonds.

The securitization of vaccine research enables investors to reduce their risk of financial loss to a scale that is not readily achievable under current financing mechanisms, as they can invest in many vaccine projects at once, thus increasing the likelihood of at least one success. The normalization of returns created by the construction of an asset portfolio permits the issuance of debt, which allows fixed-income investors to gain exposure in a space that is traditionally too risky to represent a compelling opportunity for investment. The ability to issue debt is critical, because bond markets have much greater access to capital than does venture capital or the private and public equity markets. This allows the megafund to raise enough funding to purchase an array of assets and reach its critical threshold of diversification.",

To determine the returns generated by such a portfolio, we assumed a 15-year period of exclusivity and a 10% cost of capital to calculate the NPV of future cash flows upon approval in year 5. This value must be weighed against the possibility of total loss if the vaccine project fails. An assessment of the megafund's returns therefore requires estimates of the probabilities of success of each of the 141 vaccine candidate projects as well as the pairwise correlation of success of all possible pairs of assets. The probabilities of success are based on estimates of the compounded probabilities of advancement from preclinical testing to vaccine approval. The probability of development through phase 2 of a vaccine at the start of preclinical testing is 32%, based on the transition probabilities provided by CEPI (1 practical assumptions to project revenue. In this model, we assumed that the prophylactic regimen would consist of a single dose of vaccine. The probability of disease outbreak was estimated based on historical outbreaks per disease, while regimen demand was projected using historical outbreak size, potential for pandemic spread, and an assessment of relative clinical severity. These demand parameters were determined respectively by case estimates from documented outbreaks, referencing the Woolhouse assessment for pandemic potential, and comparing the clinical presentation and prognosis for each disease (26, 27) . A perceived demand multiplier was assigned based on Woolhouse classification and clinical severity on a five-step scale ranging from mild to severe. The average number of cases and the perceived demand multiplier were used to calculate the number of regimens sold in an outbreak year for each disease. This product, the expected chance of outbreak in a given year based on historic outbreak data, and the expected selling price per vaccine regimen were used to subsequently calculate the annual expected revenue for each disease. The price per regimen was estimated based on whether the disease in question typically affected high-, medium-or low-income countries. The expected price per regimen for each income level was informed by CDC, GAVI, and PAHO vaccine pricing data, respectively (28) (29) (30) . Please see Supplementary Materials for additional details. The simulated investment performance of an EID vaccine portfolio as a function of the commercial potential of each individual vaccine project is provided in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 2 (please see Supplementary Materials for more information on how returns were calculated). The commercialization potential of these vaccines is consistently very poor, orders of magnitude lower than what would be required to make them commercially viable.",

However, for an NPV of $1 billion, the vaccine portfolio becomes marginally profitable, and at $10 billion, it is highly profitable. These results suggest that many of the model parameters would have to change drastically for the portfolio to be profitable. In fact, holding all else equal, simply breaking even would require selling vaccines at approximately 100 times the price assumed in our simulations. Megafunds are, of course, not the only business model through which vaccines can be developed. Traditionally, large pharmaceutical companies have incorporated vaccine programs into broader and highly diversified portfolios of therapeutics across many indications. To explore this possibility, we estimated the impact on risk and reward of incorporating the EID vaccines portfolio into a hypothetical pre-existing and profitable ",

In a guarantee structure, a government agency promises to absorb the initial losses on the portfolio to a predetermined amount, shielding private-sector investors from substantial negative returns. For example, a guarantee on 50% of the portfolio's principal improves the expected annualized return in the base case scenario from \u221261.1% to \u221212.6% (see Table S11 in the Supplementary Materials). While this negative-expectedreturn scenario is still unlikely to attract investors, expected returns can be further increased using mechanisms such as advance market commitments and priority review vouchers. The guarantee structure-in combination with other existing revenue-boosting mechanismshas the potential to transform a financially unattractive portfolio of EID vaccine candidates into one that could realistically attract private-sector capital. Finally, we consider a subscription model under which the largest governments around the world would purchase subscriptions to EID vaccines on behalf of their constituents. To fund the cost of pursuing 141 vaccine targets at $250 million per target (for a total of $35.25 billion), suppose that the governments of the G7 countries agreed to pay a fixed subscription fee per capita over a fixed amortization period to cover this cost. How much would this subscription fee be? For an amortization period of 5 years, and an estimated total G7 population of 770,063,285 (as of 2016, according to the World Bank (31)), and a cost of capital of 10%, the per capita annual payment to cover the total cost of $35.25 billion is $12.08 per person per year. If we extend the amortization period to 10 years, the subscription fee declines to $7.45 per person per year. Table 4 contains the per capital subscription fees as a percentage of the annual per capita healthcare expenditure of each G7 country and as expected, the cost is trivial for all countries, ranging from a high of 0.59% for Italy to a low of 0.15% for the US using a 5-year amortization period.",

Due to the inherent unpredictability in the scale and timing of outbreaks, the future demand for a specific EID vaccine is typically unclear. An additional factor is geopolitical. Diseases that are traditionally found in only a few, lower-income countries may not attract as many R&D dollars because generating a return on investment is more difficult in those limited markets (25, 38) . While wealthier governments might issue purchase agreements to assure vaccine sponsors of returns (38), these commitments are more difficult to secure for EIDs in lower-income countries or those undergoing economic hardship. However, an increasing number of stakeholders are realizing the danger of this dynamic for low and high-income countries alike, as under epidemic outbreak conditions, diseases like Zika and Ebola have the potential to spread much further than their traditional locales. The Ebola outbreaks in West Africa in 2014 demonstrate how the absence of vaccine demand prior to an event may result in a tragic loss of life and a regional economic setback. It is a significant concern that years after those outbreaks, the demand for Ebola vaccines remains limited and uncertain, allowing gaps in preparedness to persist (39) (40) (41) .",

As a result, if EID vaccine candidates are to be developed, continued private-public cooperation will be imperative, and novel approaches to engage and attract capital will be needed. While bond markets are capable of providing access to substantial amounts of capital to help vaccine development efforts, the resources available to the public sector have great potential as well (43) . In 2015, the U.S. spent $9,990 per person on healthcare (44) . If we assume that there are 300 million Americans, just 1.25% of this amount of spending would yield $37.46 billion dollars, greater than the projected $35.25 billion it would take to fund the entire EID portfolio of vaccines. While achieving such an allocation of funding would hardly be as simple as this calculation suggests, this thought experiment illustrates that encouraging the development of vaccines that protect against EIDs of pandemic potential is well within the means of the global public and private sector stakeholders, if there is public support and political will. In fact, there is evidence to indicate that people expect and would support further protection from these threats (45) .",

Vaccine developers under this model would most likely sell subscriptions to governments, building upon existing infrastructure, such as the U.S. government's biodefense and pandemic preparedness programs. To balance the concern that nonsubscribers may require vaccine regimens with the objective of encouraging subscription ahead of outbreaks, a tiered pricing scheme rewarding early adoption could be implemented. A private subscription model should also be explored, however, as it would enable individuals, communities, and corporations to take greater ownership in preparedness.

For example, the first Kremer Prize of \u00a350,000 was awarded in 1977 for the invention of the \"first substantial flight of a human-powered airplane\" (7) . While some experts believe that this approach might create sufficient incentives for research and development in less commercially attractive diseases (8, 9) , there is substantial difficulty in applying this structure to EID vaccines, as the prize pool would have to be large enough to offset the high development costs. As a result, several experts have proposed market-based approaches instead (10, 11) . Most recently, a prize model has been proposed to incentivize the development of novel antibiotics to address the increasing global problem of antibiotic resistance (12) . Importantly, the price is delinked from the volume of sales (as with U.S. government acquisition programs), a key issue for EIDs, where volumes are often insufficient to drive viable markets (13) .",

Such vouchers can be used by the company for the accelerated review of another, potentially more lucrative asset, or sold to another firm for review of one of their own assets. Extending this program to medical countermeasures has been under consideration for years (1) , and the U.S. 21st Century Cures Act expanded the scope of the program to MCMs for material threats (e.g., smallpox), now including Ebola and Zika (14, 15 ). An analysis by Berman and Radhakrishna suggests that these vouchers have tremendous value, with one selling for as much as $350 million on the open market (16) . However, their value may be waning as more become available, as acquisition prices have decreased over the last few years (15) . Even so, the idea has garnered significant attention, and a European equivalent overseen by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been proposed (17) .",

This concept is similar to the advance purchasing commitments that the U.S. government can make under Project BioShield for MCMs up to eight years in advance of their licensure (18) . Advance market commitments allow vaccine developers to assess the potential demand for their product if approved, and provide some guarantee of expected compensation for their efforts. Levine et al. (10) describe how such a structure would operate. Essentially, stakeholders from wealthy countries would agree to pay a certain price per dose for a successful vaccine against a target disease, subsidizing the amount that a poorer country would pay, should the development project prove successful. While the risk of scientific failure would still be present, some of the potential demand and revenue would be quantified before the project would be undertaken, serving as encouragement to prospective developers. However, this approach assumes that wealthier entities will still be interested in purchasing vaccines for relatively rare diseases that might not have a direct impact on their constituents (19) unless a significant outbreak emerges.",

            "text": "Though all the EIDs studied are a significant threat to human health, each disease presents itself with different symptoms and a unique prognosis. These differences in presentation and outcome may affect the way in which the public responds to outbreaks. We rate each disease by clinical presentation and mortality rate as mild, mild-moderate, moderate, moderatesevere or severe in Table S6 , and assign a corresponding multiplier in Table S7 . The multipliers in Table S7 were informed by recent developments about a promising new vaccine candidate for Ebola. According to the most recent reports, Merck has promised to produce 300,000 doses of the vaccine (53), while the 2015 outbreak totaled approximately 30,000 cases (54) . Given the severity of clinical symptoms and high mortality rate associated with Ebola infection, we assign a multiplier of 10 to our \"severe\" category of diseases, and adjust our multiplier accordingly based on clinical severity. While each of these diseases has the potential to cause severe illness, some are asymptomatic in most patients, and thus less likely to elicit high demand for a resulting vaccine. In assigning ratings, we also assumed that the potential for certain sequelae will increase demand for certain vaccines; while the presentation of Zika is generally mild, the possibility of birth defects resulting from infection in pregnant women will likely boost the demand for this vaccine, increasing its relative rating. The price per dose of vaccine was estimated by taking the average of prices listed in the CDC Adult vaccine price list 2016 (55); UNICEF's 2016 product menu for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (56) ; and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) expanded program of immunization vaccine prices for 2016 (57) . These three averages serve as our vaccine price for high, low, and middle income countries respectively. We then use these to price each vaccine based on the income level of the countries most likely to have an outbreak of a particular disease. (The endemic country/disease/pricing per dose pairings are listed in Table S8 below.) It should be noted that we took a conservative stance on pricing in our model, opting to model the lower income country price for diseases that have historically emerged in nations with differing ability to pay. Our pricing is also likely conservative due to our inclusion of each vaccine on each menu in our mean calculations, including older vaccines that are apt to be produced and sold at lower cost than new vaccines.",
