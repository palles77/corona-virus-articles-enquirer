Even prior to this pandemic the high prevalence of burnout, the complex causes, and critical consequences had been widely reported (1, 2) . Many institutional and individual interventions have been advocated to address burnout and promote wellness including decreased workload, improved work schedules and EHR, mindfulness (including MBSR) and personal coaching (1, 2, 3) . The need for effective strategies and tools is only increasing as both individuals and institutions navigate the current anxiety and uncertainty.",

In our experience, both physicians and managers hunger for skills and strategies to help successfully navigate their increasingly complex worlds. In particular, physicians long to serve their patients and practices with energy and inspiration, and have some semblance of balance in their lives. In our experience physicians especially enjoy highly actionable tools that require minimal time to learn and implement, a.k.a. \"micro-practices.\" \"Micro-practices\" only require a few seconds to a few minutes to implement. Those that connect with an already existing activity offer a special appeal and ease, such as a moment for mindfulness when using hand sanitizer (4). Hand hygiene-now a constant routine in and out of the hospital--is a continual opportunity for self-awareness and self-management. It can be an opportunity and invitation to focus on one's breath, center one's mind and body, and visualize the kind of presence, empathy and calmness one would like to bring to the next patient and the next moment. It's also an opportunity to self-connect-am I well hydrated? Hungry? Carrying an unreasonable emotional or mental vestige from the last patient or the last news update? Quick micro-practices like these are potentially possible even for the busiest radiologist or other health care provider.",

For example, when I notice that I'm feeling \"upset,\" is it anger? Concern? Exhaustion? Such naming aids self-awareness and self-management. This \"name it to tame it\" practice, to paraphrase Dr. Dan Siegel, has supportive fMRI research; it has been show to shift brain activity from the amygdala, the emotional center of the brain, to the higher order thinking area of the brain, specifically the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. In so doing it can help bring calm and ease (5) . Helpful lists of the range of human feelings are readily available and can help facilitate this process (6).",

This quick practice can aid well-being (7). Sexton and Adair studied a similar practiced called \"Three Good Things\" (3GT) in healthcare workers including physicians, PAs, nurses, and administrative staff. They found that a 15 day practice of recording 3 good things had significant positive benefits on self-reported happiness, burnout, work-life balance, and depression (8) . Extending gratitude practices into groups, such as starting meetings by giving kudos for recent efforts, can also help stimulate positive emotions and positive relationships among team members. Clearly many good things are happening in the midst of all the stress and swirl-the dedication of so many, kindness and consideration for those most at risk, and emotional support. To help us survive, our minds are biased to notice risks and danger; consciously noticing the good can help bring balance and calm.",

There seems to be an important element of \"Oh, I'm not alone with these challenges\" that spontaneously arises. They see, and hear, that others they know and respect face similar circumstances and stresses. While learning about these micro-practices, they also gain practical tips from their colleagues' hard earned wisdom and experience. One radiologist reported how she tracks her tension level during a busy work day. If the level is high and she gets a flurry of questions from technologists, she has learned to pause and consciously respond with the statement, \"I just need a minute.\" This simple phrase gives her time to settle and then offer a more connecting response, rather than a reflexive reaction. The technologists have come to know the short wait is well worth the few extra seconds of time.",

Given diaphragmatic breathing is low cost, self-administered, non-pharmacological, and highly portable, it is easy to try (provided no prohibiting health conditions exist). Further study is needed better define its mechanism, efficacy, and the minimal time needed for positive benefits.
