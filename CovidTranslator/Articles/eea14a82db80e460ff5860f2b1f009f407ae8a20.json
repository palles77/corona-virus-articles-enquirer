            "text": "Avian coronaviruses, including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), are important respiratory pathogens of poultry. The heavily glycosylated IBV spike protein is responsible for binding to host tissues. Glycosylation sites in the spike protein are highly conserved across viral genotypes, suggesting an important role for this modification in the virus life cycle. Here, we analyzed the N-glycosylation of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of IBV strain M41 spike protein and assessed the role of this modification in host receptor binding. Ten single Asn-to-Ala substitutions at the predicted N-glycosylation sites of the M41-RBD were evaluated along with two control Val-to-Ala substitutions. CD analysis revealed that the secondary structure of all variants was retained compared with the unmodified M41-RBD construct. Six of the 10 glycosylation variants lost binding to chicken trachea tissue and an ELISA-presented \u24232,3-linked sialic acid oligosaccharide ligand. LC/MS E glycomics analysis revealed that glycosylation sites have specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes. Overall, the glycosylation patterns of most variant RBDs were highly similar to those of the unmodified M41-RBD construct. In silico docking experiments with the recently published cryo-EM structure of the M41 IBV spike protein and our glycosylation results revealed a potential ligand receptor site that is ringed by four glycosylation sites that dramatically impact ligand binding. Combined with the results of previous array studies, the glycosylation and mutational analyses presented here suggest a unique glycosylation-dependent binding modality for the M41 spike protein.",

Alternative site Asn-36 was conserved 50% of the time, and one or both Asn-33 and Asn-36 was present in 94% of the sequences. Site Asn-57 was conserved at 73%.

Recently, Zheng et al. (14) studied extracted spike proteins and mutant viruses with Asn-to-Asp (asparagine to aspartate) and Asn-to-Gln (aspara-gine to glutamine) mutations at 13 predicted glycosylation sites in the S protein of the Beaudette IBV strain (14) . Their results indicate that glycosylation at some sites on the Beaudette S1-RBD was important for viral fusion and infectivity, which may include host recognition. However, the Beaudette strain is a cell culture-adapted strain, is nonvirulent in chickens (15) , and does not bind chicken tissues known to be important for infectivity (11) , making it difficult to extrapolate these results to clinically relevant IBVs.",

Systematic deletion of each glycosylation site and histochemical analysis of each variant revealed which of the 10 glycosylation sites affect the binding of IBV S protein to host epithelial tissue. Site occupancy analysis by LC/MS E indicated that at least 9 of 10 predicted N-glycosylation sites in the M41-RBD domain are glycosylated. Analysis of site occupancy and signature N-glycan patterns at each site in combination with single glycosylation site deletions provided insight toward the biological relevance of each of those sites in binding to host tissue receptors. Overall, our data confirm that N-glycosylation plays a critical and likely unique role in binding of the IBV spike domain to its host tissue receptors.",

Recombinantly produced glycovariant RBD proteins migrated with the same electrophoretic mobility as unmodified M41-RBD (Fig. 1) . The RBD proteins were evaluated by CD spectroscopy to assess similarity to the WT secondary structure. WT M41-RBD, all 10 glycosylation-site variants, and two nonglycosylation variants, V57A and V58A, were analyzed for secondary structure differences at 25\u00b0C. Thermal melts were performed on each construct from 25 to 95\u00b0C followed by full scans collected at 95\u00b0C and again at 25\u00b0C after the melt. Overlays of all the CD spectra can be found in Fig. S2 . Visually, all spectra at all temperatures follow the same curve. The N85A spectra were generated at higher protein concentrations but aligned well to CD spectra of all other variants when normal-ized to the percent of maximum signal. Likewise, all the proteins had analogous broad melting curves suggesting the proteins were similarly stable. Protein folding was reversible for all proteins, with comparable recovery rates (see CD-25\u00b0C-aftermelt-normalized in Fig. S2 ). Dichroweb (16) was used to calculate the percent of \u2423-helix, \u2424-strand, turn, and unordered portions of the protein in the initial 25\u00b0C spectra to estimate secondary structure differences between the proteins (Fig. 2) . The percent of \u2423-helix varied with the extremes being unmodified RBD and N145A. N145A exhibited 19.5 \u03ee 0.3% \u2423-helix character as compared with WT, which has 31.6 \u03ee 2.4%. Interestingly, N145A gave a very strong signal in the histochemical assay ( Fig. 3A ) and had the most notably different released glycans' signature compared with the other constructs. We conclude that all proteins maintained a very similar structure and therefore suggest that single N-glycosylation sites are by themselves not indispensable for protein folding or stability.",

Over 100 glycan compositions were identified ranging from high-mannose glycans to large complex ones. Nearly half of the glycans contained at least one and up to three sialic acid molecules in all samples. The most intense glycoforms clustered in five groups with increasing amounts of complexity as reflected by the number of N-acetyl glucosamines (HexNAcs). These include high-mannose, complex, and hybrid forms as follows: I, Hex 5-9 HexNAc 2 (high mannose); II, NeuAc 0 -1 Hex 5-6 dHex 0 -1 HexNAc 3 (complex and hybrid); III, NeuAc 0 -2 Hex 5 dHex 1 HexNAc 4 (complex); IV, NeuAc 0 -1 Hex 6 dHex 1 HexNAc 5 (complex); and V, NeuAc 2 Hex 7 dHex 1 HexNAc 6 (complex). High-mannose glycans were less abundant in unmodified M41 than in variant RBDs. The N194A, N219A, and N229A variants contained diminished amounts of the group V high-mass complex glycans. The N145A variant was the most atypical with less defined clustering in the common clustering regions of the spectrum and higher abundances in spectral regions where compositions had less Hex and more HexNAc overall. For instance, cluster IV was shifted from glycans with 6 hexoses (NeuAc 0 -1 Hex6 dHex 1 HexNAc 5 ) to glycoforms with 3-4 hexoses (NeuAc 0 -1 Hex3-4 dHex 1 HexNAc 5 ). More abundance was observed in regions containing 6 HexNAc residues (NeuAc 0 -2 Hex 3-6 dHex 1 HexNAc 6 ). To better understand the difference between N145A and the other constructs, we calculated the monosaccharide percent mass and average mass for each construct. The average mass percent for glycans across all released glycan pools was Hex (45.8%), HexNAc (42.0%), dHex (5.0%), and NeuAc (7.2%). The N145A construct had the lowest amount of Hex (38.6%) and the highest amounts of HexNAc (46.0%) and NeuAc (9.8%). The former two were 2 S.D. or greater from the mean (see Table S2 ). This indicates that the N145A construct likely had shorter, more branched, and more highly-charged glycans on average than the other constructs. Two other variants had values more than 2 S.D. from the mean. N229A (normal binding) was most abundant in Hex (53.6%) and least abundant in HexNAc (37.5%) and dHex (3.8%), probably due to its higher high-mannose content. N246A (normal binding) had the lowest amount of NeuAc (3.6%). This is perhaps a reflection of the missing sugars in this variant because site Asn-246 in ",

The interaction at site D involved both sugar-protein and sugar-sugar contacts, and in some docking runs, the interaction was completely sugar-sugar. Site D is in the center of a circle of glycosylation sites that showed altered binding profiles when mutated; N59A, N85A, and N160A lost the ability to bind, whereas N145A gave a very strong signal in the histochemical assay. Of note, no ligands docked in the site at the top of the galectin fold where many structural homologs of M41 are thought to bind sugars, such as the bovine coronavirus RBD (19) . For comparison, we docked Neu5Ac(\u24232-6)Gal(\u24241-3)GlcNAc (\u2424-OMe) against the crystal structure of the bovine RBD.

CD analysis demonstrated that both secondary structure and stability were similar across all the RBD constructs indicating the proper fold was likely retained for all. Globally, percent abundances of sialylated glycans differed across mutants, but the differences were not associated with loss of binding. For example, 51 and 20% of the glycans in binding mutants N145A and N246A, respectively, and 46 and 51% of the glycans in the nonbinders N126A and N160A, respectively, were sialylated (summed from Fig. 4) . By comparison, 40% of the glycans in the unmodified RBD construct were sialylated. On a site-specific basis, some glycosylation sites had more sialylation than others (Table S1 ). On average, each of glycosites Asn-126, Asn-194, Asn-229, and Asn-246 were sialylated at least 50% of the time. Sites Asn-229 and Asn-246 were in the less-ordered region of the protein Figure 5 .

Loss of Asn-126 in the M41 RBD abrogates binding to trachea tissue. Although ablation of Asn-126 diminishes ligand binding, our docking study gave no evidence that this is the sialyl ligand-binding site in M41. Evaluation of the charge distribution in the proposed binding sites indicates that the bovine site is negatively charged, whereas the negative charge in the same region in M41 is sparse (Fig. 7) .

Rotavirus protein VP4, for example, binds sialic acid in a groove between the \u2424-sheets of the sandwich (20) . The clustering of five of six required N-glycosylation sites suggests the location of the ligand-binding site may be on the right of the galectin fold as shown in Fig. 5 . Our docking experiments studying 17 possible oligosaccharide ligands to M41 were not conclusive in terms of binding energies but did identify four potential saccharide-binding regions (Fig. 6) . Docking also demonstrated that glycosylation affects binding in silico because one potential site (site A; see Fig. 6 ) lost favor, whereas another one, site D, dramatically gained favor when the protein was glycosylated. Site D is in the center of three glycosylated asparagines required for binding (Asn-59, Asn-85, and Asn-160), and one whose loss results in a very strong histochemical signal and has a protein-wide effect on glycosylation with increased sialylation (Asn-145) . In addition, the site D region is negatively charged (see Fig. 7A ) like the proposed sialyl ligandbinding site on the bovine protein (Fig. 7B) (19) . All the ligands that interacted with site D were sialylated and included the glycan that bound in our ELISA studies. Interestingly, carbohydrate-carbohydrate contacts were detected in the RBD-ligand interactions at site D. This is an intriguing result because carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions, although not common, have been reported between nonfucosylated antibodies and their receptor, in cell-cell adhesion interactions, between tumor antigens, and between bacterial receptors and mucin (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . A literature search did not uncover any reported carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions between virus and host. Although our docking study must be evaluated in the context of the higher root mean square deviations typical of EM structures, and the inexactness of modeled oligosaccharides, results suggest that a combination of carbohydratecarbohydrate and carbohydrate-protein interactions should be considered in the binding mechanism.",

Based on occupancy data, at least nine sites were glycosylated in the recombinant M41-RBD. Deletion of individual glycosylation sites had little effect on secondary structure, but it did have some effect on overall glycosylation profiles of some variants, especially N145A. Some differences can be expected because one site, with specific glycans, is lost from each variant, thus mildly altering overall profiles. In silico docking suggests that glycosylation may guide ligand binding. Especially intriguing is site D, where glycosylation is required for in silico docking at that site. The interaction of M41 IBV with sialyl ligand may prove to be a unique interaction involving both carbohydrates and protein. Further investigation is warranted.",

However, spontaneous deamidation of unmodified Asn to Asp can also occur. 18 O-Water, which results in mass shift of 2.984 Da, was used to ensure calculated percent occupancy was not skewed due to spontaneous deamidation. This experiment allows for examination of both spontaneous and enzymatically catalyzed deamidation, and therefore, accurate estimations of percent occupancy of glycosites can be determined.

All glycosites in the M41 EM structure were occupied except Asn-246; however, Asn-246 was occupied in our data and was populated accordingly. All glycosites were glycosylated in the new PDB file based on best evidence from our MS data. The coordinates of M41-RBD without glycans, M41-RBD with modeled glycans, and bovine RBD (PDB code 4H14) were used in docking experiments. A virtual library of 17 oligosaccharides representing a variety of binding epitopes was created based on the CFG array version 4.2 (see Fig. 6 for a list). Raw models of the oligosaccharide ligands were created with the AMBER tool tleap (www.ambermd.org) 3 utilizing the GLYCAM06 force field (35), then energy minimized using YASARA (36) . Dock screening of the library was performed with the YASARA implementation of Autodock Vina (37) with default parameters. A molecular dynamics simulation with explicit water (TP3) but with fixed coordinates for the backbone atoms was run on the glycosylated M41 RBD model to allow the amino acid side chains to accommodate the added glycans and to find low energy conformations. Two models were extracted from the glycosylated MD RBD run at 5 and 10 ns, which were used for dock screening with the virtual library.",
