There is currently great interest in determining what molecular features of pathogens are detected, and how these features are sensed by the innate immune system. A better understanding of the fundamental principles of how immune responses are stimulated is critical for the design of more effective vaccines, adjuvants, and immune therapeutics.",

Several distinct nucleic acid sensors have been described and have been found to be distributed to distinct subcellular locations and exhibit distinct specificities for different nucleic acid ligands. A common theme is that nucleic acid sensors tend to induce expression of type I IFN genes and, thus, appear to be particularly important for initiating immune responses to viruses.",

It has been suggested that these pathogens trigger the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, but neither the host sensors nor the bacterial ligands that trigger cytosolic induction of type I IFNs by these pathogens have been identified. Intriguingly, evidence from L. monocytogenes suggests that bacterial multidrug efflux pumps are required for induction of type I IFN , and raises the possibility that a small molecule substrate of these pumps, rather than DNA, is the bacterial trigger of type I IFN gene expression.",

            "text": "Nucleotide second messengers are critical transmitters of signaling in all living things. cAMP is used by bacteria and eukaryotes alike, whereas certain nucleotide second messengers are unique to bacteria. For example, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) is a key regulator of the stringent response in bacteria (Srivatsan and Wang, 2008) . Another nucleotide second messenger, cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP), is a relatively recently appreciated cyclic ribonucleotide (Ross et al., 1987) synthesized by bacteria from two GTP precursors that are hydrolyzed and ultimately circularized via 5\ue039-to-3\ue039 monophosphate linkages. The bacterial diguanylate cyclases that synthesize c-di-GMP all contain a characteristic GGDEF domain, whereas the phosphodiesterases that specifically degrade c-di-GMP to pGpG contain an EAL domain. The GGDEF domain, and presumably c-di-GMP, appears to be limited to Bacteria (Galperin et al., 2001) and is not found in Archaea or Eukarya. c-di-GMP appears to play complex roles as a second messenger in most bacterial species, and regulates diverse processes, such as motility, biofilm formation, and virulence gene expression (Tamayo et al., 2007) . The molecular mechanisms by which c-di-GMP regulates these biological processes in bacteria are only beginning to be understood. It appears that c-di-GMP is capable of specific binding to regulatory proteins containing the PilZ protein domain (Cotter and Stibitz, 2007) . The PelD protein of P. aeruginosa is an additional non-PilZ-containing c-di-GMP sensor protein (Lee et al., 2007) .",

One early report demonstrated that 50 \u00b5M of exogenous c-di-GMP inhibited growth of human colon cancer cells (Karaolis et al., 2005a) without toxicity against normal kidney cells. Two additional reports have indicated that c-di-GMP can function as an adjuvant. One group demonstrated a highly significant (>200-fold; P < 0.001) induction of anti-ClfA IgG2a titers when mice were vaccinated with ClfA and c-di-GMP as compared with vaccination with ClfA alone (Karaolis et al., 2007a) . Another group found a similar induction of anti-\ue062-Gal titers when c-di-GMP was used as an adjuvant (Ebensen et al., 2007) . Both groups also found increased T cell responses in mice injected with c-di-GMP. Karoalis et al. (2007a) also showed that c-di-GMP has immunostimulatory effects in vivo and in vitro on innate cell populations, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, 7, 8, and 9 are transmembrane nucleic acid receptors that reside in intracellular compartments, where they detect endocytosed or autophagocytosed nucleic acids Medzhitov, 2007) . TLR7, 8, and 9 all require the signaling adaptor MyD88 to initiate downstream signaling, whereas TLR3 requires the signaling adaptor TRIF. Thus, MyD88 \ue032/\ue032 Trif \ue032/\ue032 double-knockout cells are deficient in signaling through all known TLRs that sense nucleic acids (Hoebe et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2003) .",

Cytosolic RNA appears to be sensed by two RNA helicase-containing proteins, RIG-I and Mda5 (Yoneyama et al., 2004) . Interestingly, RIG-I and Mda5 do not perform redundant functions and appear to respond to distinct classes of viruses (Gitlin et al., 2006; Hornung et al., 2006; Kato et al., 2006; Pichlmair et al., 2006; . Signaling by RIG-I and Mda5 requires a common adaptor molecule called MAVS (also known as IPS-1, Cardif, or VISA; Kawai et al., 2005; Meylan et al., 2005; Seth et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2006) . MAVS recruits the TBK1 kinase that phosphorylates and activates the IRF3 transcription factor. Other transcription factors such as ATF2/c-Jun and NK-\ue06bB form a coordinated DNA-bound complex with IRF3, and are together required for robust activation of the IFN-\ue062 promoter (Maniatis et al., 1998; Panne, 2008) .",

The results indicated that the transcriptional profile of cells stimulated by cytosolic c-di-GMP was very similar to the transcriptional profile of cells stimulated with cytosolic DNA. Induction of type I IFNs and known type I IFN-inducible genes dominated the transcriptional response, but other genes (e.g., Il6, Cd86, and Cxcl9) were also strongly induced ( Fig. 1 F and Table S1 ). Although the transcriptional profiles of cells stimulated with c-di-GMP and DNA were highly similar, a small number of genes were reproducibly preferentially induced by c-di-GMP as compared with DNA (e.g., HtrA serine peptidase 4 and claudin 23; Table S1 ).

To rule out a role for TLRs in sensing of c-di-GMP, we tested responses in Myd88 \ue032/\ue032 Trif \ue032/\ue032 double-knockout macrophages, which are deficient in all TLR signaling (Yamamoto et al., 2003) . Both wild-type and Myd88 \ue032/\ue032 Trif \ue032/\ue032 macrophages showed a robust induction of IFN-\ue062 after c-di-GMP stimulation (Fig. 2 A) . As expected, the Myd88 \ue032/\ue032 Trif \ue032/\ue032 macrophages did not respond to LPS (Fig. 2 A) . These results indicated that TLR signaling is not required for responsiveness to c-di-GMP, and are consistent with c-di-GMP signaling via a cytosolic surveillance pathway.",

IRF3 activation requires phosphorylation by the TBK1 kinase, which leads to IRF3 dimerization and nuclear translocation (Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Sharma et al., 2003; Hemmi et al., 2004; McWhirter et al., 2004; Perry et al., 2004) . To address whether TBK1 is required for activation of type I IFN by c-di-GMP, we tested including monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes. c-di-GMP induced dendritic cell maturation and led to the production of various cytokines and chemokines, including TNF, IL-1\ue062, IP-10, Rantes, and CXCR4 (Karaolis et al., 2007a) . However, c-di-GMP did not stimulate induction of type I IFNs by plasmacytoid dendritic cells.

The partial requirement for Irf7 may reflect a c-di-GMP responses in Tbk1 \ue032/\ue032 macrophages (Fig. 2 B) . We observed very little IFN-\ue062 induction by c-di-GMP in cells lacking Tbk1, suggesting that TBK1 is required for c-di-GMP signaling. We also observed that Tbk1 is required for the induction of IFN-\ue062 by pdA:dT ( Fig. 2 B) , in agreement with a recently published report (Miyahira et al., 2009) . Although the data indicate a key role for Tbk1 in the response to c-di-GMP, it is formally possible, albeit unlikely, that Tbk1 protein rather than Tbk1 kinase activity is required for the response. We also tested the requirement for the TBK1related kinase Ikbke (also called IKK\ue0ab or IKK-i), which plays (Jiang et al., 2005) using recombinant IFN-\ue062 as a standard. *, P < 0.01 as compared with transfected c-di-GMP (Student's t test).

(C) Bone marrow macrophages were transfected with 3.3 \u00b5g/ml of the indicated molecules (or overlaid with 100 ng/ml LPS), and transcription of the IFN-\ue062 gene (Ifnb) was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, with normalization to ribosomal protein rps17 message. n.d., not detectably induced above background (lipofectamine alone). *, P < 0.001 as compared with unstimulated cells (Student's t test). (D) As in C, but transcription of the IFN-\ue0615 gene was assessed. n.d., not detectably induced above background (lipofectamine alone). *, P < 0.01 as compared with unstimulated cells (Student's t test). (E) c-di-GMP, treated or untreated with snake venom phosphodiesterase, was transfected at 3.3 \u00b5g/ml into B6 bone marrow macrophages and analyzed after 6 h for IFN-\ue062 production by bioassay, as in A. *, P < 0.02 as compared with c-di-GMP treatment alone (Student's t test). Results in A-E are representative of at least three independent experiments. Data are means \u00b1 SD (n = 3). (F) Bone marrow macrophages were transfected with poly dA:dT (DNA) or with c-di-GMP. Total RNA was isolated after 6 h of stimulation. Probes were amplified and hybridized to whole-transcriptome spotted MEEBO microarrays. Each dot represents a single gene, and its position is determined by its induction in response to DNA (x axis) or c-di-GMP (y axis). Most genes lie on the diagonal, indicative of similar induction ratios by both treatments. Selected highly induced genes are labeled. Two independent microarray experiments gave similar results.",

The DNA molecules capable of provoking cytosolic responses are double stranded and >25 deoxyribonucleotides in length Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006a) . In contrast, c-di-GMP is composed of two guanosine ribonucleotides (not deoxyribonucleotides) in an unusual cyclic conformation. c-di-GMP also lacks features consistent with recognition by RIG-I or Mda5, such as 5\ue039triphosphate, polyuridine, or double strandedness . Therefore, we considered whether distinct sensors might be responsible for triggering responses to DNA/RNA and c-di-GMP, and if so, whether the responses could be distinguished in certain cell types. macrophage cell line stably transfected with an NF-\ue06bB luciferase reporter. We observed activation of the NF-\ue06bB luciferase reporter by transfected c-di-GMP (Fig. 3 C) . Both the gel shift and reporter assays showed that the activation of NF-\ue06bB by transfected c-di-GMP was not as strong as observed with transfected pdA:dT and pI:C. The subtle difference in NF-\ue06bB induction between cytosolic DNA and c-di-GMP may suggest that there are distinct signaling components upstream of NF-\ue06bB in the two pathways. Nonetheless, we concluded that transfected c-di-GMP is capable of activating NF-\ue06bB. The relatively low levels and late time course of NF-\ue06bB induction by c-di-GMP (as compared with induction by LPS), as well as the fact that we transfected c-di-GMP into cells, may explain why NF-\ue06bB induction was not previously observed in response to c-di-GMP (Karaolis et al., 2007a) .",

Given the marked chemical dissimilarities among DNA, RNA, and c-di-GMP, it is perhaps not surprising that these nucleic acids appear to be recognized by different sensors. Indeed, we favor the idea that there are multiple cytosolic sensors for nucleic acids leading to induction of type I IFNs. The specificities of these various sensors will require further dissection. For example, although DAI knockout cells still responded to c-di-GMP, it remains formally possible that DAI is just one of several redundant sensors for c-di-GMP.

Other related small nucleic acid compounds such as GTP, cGMP, ppGpp, and pGpG did not trigger transcriptional induction of type I IFNs (Fig. 1) . In addition, c-di-GMP that was hydrolyzed by snake venom phosphodiesterase did not induce type I IFN (Fig. 1) . However, our results cannot eliminate the possibility that a metabolite of c-di-GMP, rather than c-di-GMP itself, is the true molecular moiety that is sensed in the cytosol. Elimination of this possibility awaits identification of the c-di-GMP sensor and biophysical or crystallographic characterization of its binding to c-di-GMP. Our results also cannot eliminate the possibility that c-di-GMP triggers type I IFN expression indirectly, for example, by stimulating the synthesis of a host ligand that functions as the \"true\" proximal trigger of type I IFN gene expression. It is also possible that c-di-GMP acts \"pharmacologically\" by disrupting host physiology in a way that results in type I IFN expression. Moreover, because the signaling triggered by c-di-GMP and cytosolic DNA are very similar, it is possible that the c-di-GMP pathway is a branch off of the DNA-sensing pathway rather than a fully independent pathway. However, even if these alternative models are correct, our data indicate that the pathway downstream of c-di-GMP contains at least some novel components and is at least partially independent of known cytosolic or TLR signaling pathways.",

The mechanism by which these pathogens induce type I IFN resembles that of c-di-GMP: in all cases, type I IFN induction is independent of MyD88/Trif and TLRs, requires TBK1 and IRF3, and (with one exception; unpublished data; Opitz et al., 2006) is independent of the cytosolic RNA-sensing pathway. It is widely assumed that bacterial DNA, perhaps released after bacterial cell lysis, is the relevant ligand that triggers type I IFNs in response to pathogens. There are no data that eliminate or confirm this possibility, as sensors required for IFN induction in response to cytosolic bacteria have not yet been reported. However, it is noteworthy that in all cases, induction of type I IFNs by cytosolic bacteria requires expression of an auxiliary secretion system, namely the ESX-1 system of M. tuberculosis, the Francisella pathogenicity island-encoded 2007a). Serum was collected from immunized mice 2 wk after a single intraperitoneal injection. Mice immunized with HSA alone did not mount a significant antibody response to HSA. In contrast, mice injected with HSA plus c-di-GMP produced variable but significant titers of HSA-specific IgG1 antibodies, confirming that c-di-GMP can function as an adjuvant in vivo. Importantly, our preliminary data indicated that the adjuvant effect of c-di-GMP depended on IRF3/7, as antibody responses in Irf3/7 \ue032/\ue032 mice immunized with HSA and c-di-GMP were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced as compared with immunized B6 mice (Fig. 6 C) . Further studies will be required to establish the mechanism by which c-di-GMP functions as an adjuvant, but our results are consistent with a recent report indicating that the IRF3/7 kinase, TBK1, is required for adaptive immune responses in a DNA-vaccine model (Ishii et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "It has been well established that innate immune responses are initiated in response to certain microbial ligands that are evolutionarily conserved and that can be distinguished from selfligands. Nucleic acids appear to be a favored target of immune recognition, and are sensed by a variety of endosomal and cytosolic sensor proteins. The cyclic dinucleotide c-di-GMP is a bacterial second messenger that exhibits several characteristics that are desirable in an immunostimulatory ligand: it is produced by numerous species of bacteria, it is a critical regulator of bacterial physiology, and it is not similar to host molecules. Indeed, several previous reports have demonstrated that c-di-GMP can provoke potent immune responses when injected in vivo into mice (Karaolis et al., 2005a; Karaolis et al., 2005b; Karaolis et al., 2007a; Karaolis et al., 2007b) . However, the mechanism by which c-di-GMP stimulates immune responses remained unclear. Our data provide evidence that c-di-GMP is sensed by a novel cytosolic immunosurveillance pathway. Responsiveness to c-di-GMP is independent of TLRs that monitor the extracellular/endosomal compartments and is strongly potentiated by transfection of c-di-GMP into the host cell cytosol. Moreover, c-di-GMP provokes a transcriptional response highly reminiscent of that triggered by the cytosolic presence of DNA or RNA, and involves activation of TBK-1, MAP kinases, and the IRF-3 and NF-\ue06bB transcription factors. Thus, we propose that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol.",

Known nucleic acid sensors include Mda5 and RIG-I, which sense viral RNA and signal via MAVS, as well as DAI, a putative sensor of DNA that signals independently of MAVS. Based on the finding that most cell types, including MEFs, can still respond to DNA in the absence of DAI (Ishii et al., 2008) , it has been proposed that an additional DNA sensor must exist and that MEFs express both of these sensors . Our results now suggest that there is at least one additional nucleic acid sensor in the cytosol, because we find that MEFs do not B.

Cell-culture supernatants from stimulated cells were overlayed on top of ISRE-L929 IFN reporter cells (Jiang et al., 2005) and incubated for 4-6 h (96-well plate). The reporter cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) for 5 min at room temperature, mixed with firefly luciferin substrate (Biosynth), and measured on a luminometer (LmaxII 384 ; MDS Analytical Technologies). Levels of type I IFN were calculated from a standard curve using recombinant mouse IFN-\ue062 (R&D Systems). secretion system of F. tularensis, the Dot/Icm system of L. pneumophila, or the MdrM multidrug efflux pump of L. monocytogenes. It is tempting to speculate that a small, bacterially derived molecule such as c-di-GMP could be transported or leak through these secretion systems. It has not yet been possible to test this idea directly because all of these bacterial species encode numerous c-di-GMP synthases, and a strain lacking all c-di-GMP synthesis has not been reported. In any case, interpretation of these experiments would be complicated by the fact that c-di-GMP plays important regulatory roles in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. Nevertheless, our results with synthetic purified c-di-GMP suggest that in addition to DNA, c-di-GMP is a candidate for a conserved molecule unique to bacteria that is responsible for triggering transcription of type I IFN genes. In light of a recent report that bacteria appear to be able to synthesize c-di-AMP (Witte et al., 2008) , it is interesting to consider whether additional nucleic acids produced specifically by bacteria might also trigger host immunosurveillance pathways. Non-nucleic acid small molecules, such as the drug DMXAA, also appear to be able to stimulate the TBK1-IRF3 axis (Roberts et al., 2007) . Indeed, there may be multiple redundant pathways for cytosolic sensing of bacteria. Collectively, the available evidence suggests that host cells may sense a wider array of bacterial ligands than was previously appreciated.",

The potency of DNA vaccines appears to derive from their ability to stimulate the TBK1 and innate cytosolic DNA-sensing pathways . Thus, our demonstration that a synthetic nonself non-DNA molecule such as c-di-GMP can stimulate an in vitro and in vivo innate and adaptive immune response (Fig. 6 ) similar to that induced by DNA, without similar autoimmune or mutagenic risks, suggests that c-di-GMP might have valuable application as a small-molecule adjuvant.

            "text": "Accepted: 10 July 2009 ELISA. Levels of Rantes protein in supernatants from bone marrow macrophages were measured using the Rantes DuoSet Elisa kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Microarray analysis. Macrophage RNA from 10 6 cells (6-well dishes) was isolated using the Ambion RNAqueous kit (Applied Biosystems) and amplified with the Ambion Amino Allyl MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Microarrays were performed as previously described (Leber et al., 2008) . In brief, spotted microarrays using the MEEBO 70-mer oligonucleotide set (Illumina) were printed at the University of California, San Francisco Center for Advanced Technology. Microarray probes were generated by coupling amplified RNA to Cy dyes. After hybridization, arrays were washed, scanned on a GenePix 4000B Scanner (MDS Analytical Technologies), and gridded using SpotReader software (Niles Scientific). Analysis was performed using the GenePix Pro 6 and Acuity 4 software packages (MDS Analytical Technologies). Two independent experiments were performed. Microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession no. GSE16943.Cell fractionation, immunoblotting, and gel shift assays. For analysis of MAP kinase activation, whole-cell extracts were prepared from 2 \u00d7 10 6 bone marrow macrophages stimulated for the times indicated in the figures and lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with 50 mM NaF, 2 mM NaVO 3 , 25 mM \ue062-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM PMSF, and 1\u00d7 Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). For analysis of IRF3 nuclear translocation, nuclear extracts were prepared from 2 \u00d7 10 6 bone marrow macrophages stimulated for the times indicated in the figures using NE-PER nuclear extraction reagent (Pierce), supplemented with 1\u00d7 Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, using the manufacturer's protocol. Protein levels were normalized using the micro-BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and separated on 10% NuPAGE bis-tris gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and immunoblotted with various primary antibodies. Whole-cell extracts were probed with anti-p38 MAP kinase, anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182), anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/ Tyr204), anti-SAPK/JNK, and anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK(Thr183/Tyr185) antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology. Nuclear extracts were probed with anti-IRF3 and anti-lamin B (FL-425 and M-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). For EMSA, nuclear extracts from stimulated bone marrow macrophages were incubated with a 32 P end-labeled NF-\ue06bB probe (5\ue039-GAT-CAGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3\ue039). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by native gel electorophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Anti-p65 (C-20) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.In vivo experiments. C57BL/6 or Irf3/7 \ue032/\ue032 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 nmol of chemically synthesized c-di-GMP. For analysis of innate immune responses, mice were sacrificed and analyzed 18-36 h after injection, as indicated in the figures. Serum was collected and tested for IFN as described above. Splenic NK cells were assayed ex vivo for production of IFN-\ue067 in response to YAC-1 target cells, as described previously (Joncker et al., 2009) . For antibody responses, mice were injected with 25 \u00b5g of endotoxin-free HSA (Sigma-Aldrich) mixed with 200 nmol c-di-GMP or saline. 2 wk after injection, mice were bled and serum IgG1 specific for HSA was measured by ELISA.Online supplemental material. Fig. S1 shows production of Rantes in response to c-di-GMP in wild-type, Myd88 \ue032/\ue032 Trif \ue032/\ue032 , Tnfr1 \ue032/\ue032 , Tbk1 \ue032/\ue032 Tnfr1 \ue032/\ue032 , Mavs \ue032/\ue032 , Irf1 \ue032/\ue032 , Irf3 \ue032/\ue032 , Irf5 \ue032/\ue032 , Irf 7 \ue032/\ue032 , and Ifnar \ue032/\ue032 bone marrow-derived macrophages.
