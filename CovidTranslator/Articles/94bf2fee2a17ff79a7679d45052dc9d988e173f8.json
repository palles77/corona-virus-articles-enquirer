The feline practitioner often finds the inclusion of transfusion therapy in his or her management plan. Transfusion therapy is not a new practice option; however, developments in the field of transfusion medicine in the last 10 years have increased the availability of transfusion products. Identification of donors, recognition of infectious disease, and collection of blood components are areas that have advanced significantly, which makes the use of blood products a reasonable and commonplace therapeutic strategy for the feline practitioner. As the science of transfusion medicine has progressed, the concern for safety of blood products has moved to the forefront. Areas related to safety of a blood product include donor evaluation, record keeping, infectious disease screening, advanced storage techniques, and recognition of transfusion reactions.",

First, concerns were related largely to defining the science responsible for transfusion compatibility. Second, efforts shifted toward the standardization of blood product production. Finally, the industry has turned interest toward quality assurance and control. The AIDS pandemic in the early 1980s led to an extensive review of human blood component evaluation and screening. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees human blood supply in the United States. Groups such as the American Association of Blood Banks have developed extensive certification programs to ensure quality control and safety in the human blood supply. 1 The United States government does not regulate the animal blood supply. However, two organizations are now in existence for the purpose of self-regulating the industry and furthering the science of veterinary transfusion medicine: The Association of Veterinary Hematology and Transfusion Medicine (http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/ org-AVHTM) and The American Association of Veterinary Blood Banks (http://www.aavbb.org).",

            "text": "Safety of blood supply is related to careful donor evaluation, thorough record keeping, extensive infectious disease screen-ing, intensive quality assurance for storage and transport, and avoidance of transfusion reactions. Evaluating safety of the feline blood supply reveals some unique features. The size of the average domestic cat makes \"borrowing\" technology from human transfusion medicine difficult. For larger companion animals, veterinary blood bankers have utilized blood collection techniques and systems used in the human industry. The total blood volume (325 ml) of the average 10-pound cat is less than the total volume of a standard human collection set (450 ml). Therefore FDA-approved, closed-system collection sets are not available for use with feline donors. Use of an open system for collection, most commonly a 60-ml syringe and butterfly catheter, can lead to bacterial contamination of the end product. Coincidentally, bacterial contamination with Serratia marcescens in feline units is the only published incident of external contamination of transfusion products in the veterinary literature. 2 The feline donor may not be a willing volunteer. This unwillingness frequently adds the necessity for chemical restraint through sedation or anesthesia; most veterinarians who collect whole blood units from cats use anesthesia. Ketamine and diazepam continue to be a routine choice for restraint during blood donation. Concerns for the donor's ability to maintain a normotensive state during the procedure have led to exploration of other types of sedation or anesthesia. Isoflurane gas anesthesia may be used to avoid hypotension associated with most intravenous anesthetics. The presence of these drugs and stress-induced cytokines in the end product must be considered. Traditionally, safety of blood products has been limited to monitoring the \"out-of-body\" experience of the product from donor to recipient. 3 These issues surrounding the donor add an additional layer to the safety concerns that a feline blood banker must evaluate and resolve.",

Once again, because of the lack of direct information about the donor, biochemical screening before use is recommended. A complete blood count is a necessity.

The path that the unit has taken from donor to recipient is documented completely, including storage and transport at any intermediate processing or holding facility. In addition to the paper trail, aliquots of the blood components produced are maintained at the principal facility of production to provide the opportunity for testing, if requested. 6 If records are digitalized, paper copies are maintained for the life of the blood product plus 6 months past the expiration date. For example, feline packed red blood cells expire 28 days after collection and separation. Paper copies are maintained for 7 months. If records are solely paper based, copies are held for 5 to 10 years. 3",

            "text": "The drive to produce blood components rather than whole blood for cats has led to the introduction of several novel ways to provide a closed sterile system for use in feline blood banking. Giger 4 describes the use of a sterile docking device and a pediatric quadruple bag system. Using the human pediatric quadruple bag system, 150-ml bags with CPDA-1 are iso-lated and attached in a sterile manner to 19-gauge butterfly catheters. This provides a sterile closed system that may be used either as a gravity flow collection device or as a vacuum collection system. 4 The sterile docking device used in this technique is cost prohibitive to most veterinary practices. A semiclosed sterile system with onsite addition of CPDA-1 through an injection port has been designed by commercial blood bankers (Figure 57-1) . Use of this system has provided a costeffective means to collect feline blood by syringe or gravity flow and minimize the risk of external bacterial contamination of the blood product. Both systems use polyolefin or polyvinyl chloride as a base. Packaging in plastic allows for the sterile separation from whole blood to components. Glass is not considered a safe medium for blood storage because of its breakability and its inability to accommodate sterile component processing. Storage of product often is not considered a high priority by most practitioners, but when performed incorrectly, the recipient is placed at great risk for non-immune-related transfusion reaction. 7 Temperature, packaging, and appropriate handling during holding and transport periods are very important when trying to avoid storage lesion in blood. Storage lesion is defined as damage to the blood product during its \"out-of-body\" experience. Indications of storage lesion may include hemolysis, increased or decreased pH, increased ammonia, and/or increased electrolytes. See Table 57 -1 for details regarding proper storage of common feline blood components. 8, 9 Records of daily temperature are maintained for each storage device. Records also should document mode of transport and condition of the product before and after transport. Documented variations from standard operating procedure exclude the product from normal use. The end user should be made aware of any variation from standard to allow appropriate modifications of product use.",

The following recommendations were made for cats. Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus status should be evaluated by standard ELISA techniques, detecting antigen and antibody respectively. Evaluation for feline coronavirus is not recommended, because of the lack of correlation between antibody level and disease status. Mycoplasma haemofelis and Mycoplasma haemominutum are evaluated by microscopic slide evaluation and polymerase chain reaction (see Chapter 63).

More severely affected individuals may demonstrate signs of secondary infection, hemolysis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, or even death. Non-immune-related transfusion reactions are caused by circulatory overload, hemolysis resulting from storage lesion, bacterial contamination, hypothermia, and hypocalcemia. Rarely, pulmonary thromboembolism may occur post-transfusion as a non-immune-related reaction.
