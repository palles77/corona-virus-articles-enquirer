The frameshift involves a phenylalanyl-tRNA shifting into the + 1 frame at the sequence UUU-U/C. The shift does not occur if the in-frame phenylalanine codon UUU is replaced by UUC. The level of frameshifting is higher in dense cultures and is not dependent on phenylalanine starvation. In the wild-type argI gene this frameshifting event would be an error, leading to a truncated, non-functional protein. Therefore, it is unlike the numerous examples of required frameshifting events that have been described in other genes.",

Some of these errors cause \"premature termination\", the production of truncated protein, and have been termed errors in processivity (Jorgensen and Kurland 1990) . One type of processivity error is a ribosomal frameshift. Frameshifts in a typical mRNA lead to truncated proteins because after the frameshift the ribosome will encounter previously out-of-flame termination codons.",

First, of course, the truncated protein must be detected. A further problem is to determine exactly where the error occurred, since frameshifts at one of several different contiguous codons will yield a very similar product. A further problem will be to determine whether the truncated protein resulted from a frameshift or some other processivity error, such as ribosomal drop-off. To circumvent these problems, many studies have exploited suppression of frameshift mutations, and the error rate in translocation seems to vary widely (for review see Parker 1989 Parker , 1992 . However, at most codons and contexts the average frequency of a translational frameshift error must be below 10 .4 in order to make full-length protein from long mRNAs.",

However, for the most part this has come not from analyzing errors, but rather from studying transcripts from specific genes that require ribosomal frameshifts in order for a functional protein to be produced. These frameshifts, termed 'programmed frameshifts to distinguish them from frameshifting errors, range in efficiency from a few percent to over 50% (for review see Atkins et al. 1990; Jacks et al. 1988; Parker 1989 Parker , 1992 . Programmed frameshifting seems to depend on two components within the mRNA: a site of action and a stimulatory signal (Gesteland et al. 1992) . The site of action is known as the \"shifty site\" and shifting itself involves certain \"slippery tRNAs\". The stimulatory signal differs considerably among different types of programmed frameshifts, but it seems likely that in all cases the signal involves a ribosomal pause site.",

            "text": "In Escherichia coli a ribosomal frameshift is required to synthesize release factor 2 from the chromosomal gene prfB (Craigen et al. 1985; Craigen and Caskey 1986) , and to synthesize the 7 subunit of DNA polymerase III, one of two products of the dnaX gene (Blinkowa and Walker 1990; Tsuchihashi and Kornberg 1990; Flower and McHenry 1990) . In the case of the prfB mRNA, the stimulatory signal involves an in-frame termination codon, which is preceded by a Shine/Dalgarno-like sequence, both of which are important (Weiss et al. 1987; Curran and Yarus 1988; Weiss et al. 1988 ). The shifty site itself involves only CUU-U, which a tRNA Leu reads in the 0 frame and then shifts to the + 1 frame to read UUU. Frameshifting in the transcript of the dnaX gene involves the heptanucleotide sequence A-AAA-AAG, which is followed by a stem-loop. This frameshift involves simultaneous slippage of two tRNAs on the ribosome from the 0 to the -1 frame at this site (Tsuchihashi and Brown 1992) . The efficiency of the shift depends on the fact that the sole tRNA LyS species in E. coli has a stronger affinity for AAA than AAG (Tsuchihashi and Brown 1992) . This mechanism is very like that programming the -1 frameshifting observed in retroviruses (Chamorro et al. 1992 ; for reviews see Atkins et al. 1990; Parker 1992) . Secondary structure in the mRNA is the stimulatory signal for this type of frameshifting (Brierley et al. 1989) and may well be involved in ribosomal pausing (Tu et al. 1992) .",

Because amino acid starvation induces ribosomal frameshifting as well as missense errors, it seemed possible that the context effect we saw with missense errors was the indirect result of a starvation-induced, context-specific frameshift error. Frequent frameshifting at a phenylalanine codon at a particular position in the argI mRNA would lower the probability of detecting a missense error at the same position.",

The cells were pelleted, resuspended in cold buffer (100 mM TRIS-HC1, pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyI fluoride), and broken by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the soluble extract was diluted with 50 mM TRIS-HC1, pH 7.3, to approximately 4 mg/ml total protein. The extract was then loaded onto a ProtoSorb lacZ adsorbent immunoaffinity column (Promega) and fusion protein eluted as recommended by the manufacturer. The eluted protein was dialyzed extensively against distilled water, lyophilized, and then subjected to automated Edman detgadation using an Applied Biosystems Model 477 protein sequencer at the Biotechnology Center of the University of Illinois. Each cycle was analyzed by an on-line amino acid analyzer. Figure 1A shows the sequence of the mRNA at the beginning of argI, a gene encoding one of the ornithine transcarbamylase isozymes of E. coll. In our previous studies we have found that leucine misincorporation occurs at a high frequency at position 8 of ornithine transcarbamylase during phenytalanine starvation, but not at position 3 (Precup et al. 1989 ). Therefore, a number of different fusions of this region to tacZ were made in order to determine whether ribosomal frameshifting occurred at or near the codon at position 3. Ribosomal frameshifting can be detected in a particular region by fusing a frameshift window in different frames to a reporter gene (Weiss et al. 1987 . To detect frameshifting the window is constructed so that the ribosome enters it in a frame different than that of the reporter gene. The 5' end of the window constructed for this study was the initiation codon of argI. The 3' end of the window is a termination codon in the same frame as that of the entering ribosome. Therefore, the ribosome must shift at some place between the initiation codon and this in-frame termination codon in order for active /%galactosidase to be produced.",

The underlined bases are those that differ from the wild-type transcript. The in-frame termination codon in pCFP2-4 is shown in italics. The sequences before the parentheses also correspond to one strand of the oligodeoxynucleotides used to construct these plasmids. The other strand was offset to give the overlaps necessary for an EcoRI compatible end at the 5' end and a BamHI compatible end at the 3' end. The AGC following the parentheses is an in-frame codon from the lacZ gene found on the vector pSKS107 normal fusion protein because the frameshifted product would have three fewer basic amino acid residues than the 0-frame produce (see Fig. 3 ). However, in order to determine precisely where the frameshift occurred it was necessary to sequence the protein produced by pCFP4. Therefore, the fusion protein was isolated from a strain carrying pCFP4 and analyzed by automated Edman degradation. The residues determined by this analysis are shown in Fig. 3 . Note that although this sequence is consistent with a + 1 frameshift at the sequence U U U -U, it is also consistent with a + 1 frameshift at the sequence GGG-U, or a simultaneous frameshift. Such a simultaneous shift by tRNAs occupying both the P-site and the A-site of the ribosome would be similar to the mechanism of frameshifting at the heptanucleotide sequences found in retroviruses, but in the opposite direction. In order to establish more precisely the mechanism of the frameshift in argI, constructs were made that were similar to pCFP4, but with changes in the bases in and around the frameshift site. These constructs, and the results we obtained by assaying figalactosidase levels in strains containing them, are shown in Fig. 4 . The results are perfectly consistent with a + 1 slippage of a Phe-tRNA Phe reading the codon U U U to either an overlapping U U U codon (pCFP4 and 9) or an overlapping U U C codon (pCFP8). Changes that would prevent normal pairing by this tRNA in either the 0 frame or the + i frame abolish frameshifting ( p C F P 5 , 6 and 7). A change in the upstream G G G codon that should similarly effect slippage by a Gly-tRNA has no effect (pCFP9).",

The + 1 shift we observed seems to involve the slippage of Phe-tRNA Phe from one U U U codon to another at the sequence UUU-U. The shift also occurs at the sequence UUU-C, but does not occur at a measurable frequency if U U C is used as the in-frame phenylalanine codon, nor if the sequence is changed to UUU-A (see Fig. 4 ). The data indicate that base-pairing between the codon and the anticodon must be maintained at each position after the shift. Further, changing the G G G codon upstream from the shifty site to a G G C had no effect. This would indicate that the mechanism of frameshifting does not involve simultaneous slippage of two tRNAs as has been ob- Fig. 2A -D Autoradiograms of two-dimensional gels containing proteins from strains with the fusion plasmids. Strains of JK601 each containing a different plasmid were grown in minimal medium and isopropyl-~-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to 1 mM when the cell density was approximately 4 x 108 cells/ml. After 120 rain the ceils were labeled with [3~S]t,-methionine for 5 rain and harvested. Extracts were prepared and proteins separated by twodimensional gel electrophoresis as described in Materials and methods.

However, the codon U U C was not checked in any other construct. Therefore, it is conceivable that when this codon is found in the mRNA there is a -1 frameshift, or some other unexpected translational event, such as ribosome drop-off. The level of\"spontaneous\" frameshifting we observed (from 2% to well over 10%) seems extraordinarily high considering that there is no evidence that this is anything other than an error. If this frameshift occurs in normal argI mRNA, termination will take place only a few codons downstream. There are no arginine codons in either reading frame that could conceivably be used to control the frequency of frameshifting or stimulate the ribosome to shift back into the correct frame. Therefore, there is no reason to believe the shift Fig. 4 Frameshift assays using plasmids with mutations at or near the frameshift site.

Shown below this are two possible translational products. The upper sequence is the peptide that would be obtained if the ribosome did not shift reading frames after initiation. The next sequence is that that would be obtained if the ribosome made a + 1 shift at the U U U codon.

Since this kind of processivity error could have very serious consequences for the cell, it will be important to determine the nature of such sites and what controls the frequency of frameshifting at them. Although it is clear what the shifty site is in the case of these argI-lacZ constructs, it is not at all clear what represents the stimulatory site. This frameshift does not involve ribosomal pausing at a stop codon or at a hungry codon. The U A U codon following the shifty site is read by a reasonably abundant tRNA in E. coli (Ikemura 1981 ) and, therefore, pausing at a rarely used codon, which can lead to frameshifting (Belcourt and Farabaugh 1990; Xu and Boeke 1990) , also does not seem to be involved. There does seem to be an increase in the frameshifting when cells are grown to high density (see Table 1 ). Some types of translational errors, including frameshifting, are known to be sensitive to the metabolic state of the cell (Bogosian et al. 1990) .",

Using computer analysis, we have examined both the wild-type argI mRNA and the mRNA from the argI-lacZ fusion for possible secondary structure (note that every little of the argI mRNA is contained in the argI-lacZ fusions and even this has several point mutations). In neither case is there a possible stem-loop structure immediately following the slippery site, although in both cases extensive secondary structure is possible in this general region of the mRNA (results not shown). The stimulatory site for frameshifting at the overlapping phenylalanine codons in gene 10 of T7 may involve complex structure in the mRNA rather than a simple secondary structure (Condron et al. 1991b ) Further analysis will be required before it is possible to understand the mechanism that stimulates the high-level, but apparently erroneous frameshift that occurs in the argI mRNA.",
