We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy. The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of Covid-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the Error Function, that is, the integral of a normal, Gaussian distribution. We have then used such a function to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available. We then found a statistical prediction for the day in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs, corresponding to the flex of the fit, i.e., to the change in sign of its second derivative (that is the change from acceleration to deceleration) as well as of the day in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached. We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations in the attempt to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above-mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease of the number of daily positive cases. Although, official data have been used, these predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach, since those predictions are based on statistical approach and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues (such as medical, social distancing, virologic, epidemiological, etc.) or models of contamination diffusion.",

Incidentally, such behavior is similar to the behavior of the incubation time of the seasonal influenza 4 . By positive cases we mean the positive cases actually diagnosed plus, for future days, the positive cases that we expect to be diagnosed. In fact it is well known among the virologists that the actual number of positive cases is much higher than the diagnosed ones 5 . However, it is assumed the diagnosed cases are a good statistical representation of the entire population of the positive cases. In Fig. 1 , we report the result of our fit of the cumulative diagnosed positive cases in China. We have then applied such a CDF to study the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy, in the attempt to possibly, statistically, predict the peak in the number of daily positive cases and the possible date of a substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases. Finally, in section 4 we have performed a number of Monte Carlo simulations to get a more robust prediction of both the date of the peak in the number of positive cases each day and the date after which the number of new positive cases is below a certain threshold.",

According to this fit, the flex, i.e. the point where the second derivative of the fit is becoming negative, that is the difference between two successive daily positive cases becomes negative, or in other words the point where there is a deceleration in the number of positive cases, is reached at March, 25, 2020.

The first one is to fit the cumulative diagnosed positive cases in Italy using data from the beginning, February 15, 2020 (included) to March 16, 2020 (included), then from February 15, 2020 to March 17, 2020 and so on, until March 26, 2020 (included), thus getting 11 evaluations of the date of the flex. We then evaluated the standard deviation of these 11 points and we obtained a 1-sigma standard deviation of 3 days. The date of the flex has a quasi oscillating behavior whose amplitude is decreasing by increasing the final date of the analysis, i.e., increasing the number of points used in the fit. The 2sigma (95.5% probability) and 3-sigma (99.7% probability) uncertainties in the day of the flex are then 6 days and 9 days respectively. In regard to the date of a substantial reduction in the number of cumulative positive cases in Italy (below 100 cases), the standard deviation is 6 days (68.2% probability), 12 days (95.5% probability) and 18 days (99.7% probability).",

However, the diagnosed cases are considered to be a representative sample of the population (i.e. of the total number of positive cases, which by the way is unknown). To get an estimate of the uncertainty in each daily number, we applied the following heuristic approach. We have assumed a measurement uncertainty in the total positive cases equal to 10% of each daily number (Gaussian distributed). the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Then, for each of the 150 simulations, the residuals (corresponding to the cumulative positive cases of days) were fitted with a four parameter function of the type of the Gauss Error Function and we then determined the date of the flex with such fitted function for each simulation. Using the fitted function we also determined the date at which the number of daily positive cases will be less than a certain threshold that we have, for example, chosen to be 100. Finally we calculated the standard deviation of these 150 simulations. In Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 , we report the values (red dots) and the mean (horizontal line) of the Monte Carlo simulations respectively for the date of the flex and for the date of a substantial reduction in the number of daily positive cases. Using = 41 days (i.e., the number of daily diagnosed positive cases up to March 26, 2020), we thus obtained a standard deviation (1-sigma) of 1 day for the date of the flex and of 2.3 days for the date in which a substantial reduction of the daily cases would be below 100. This result corresponds to a probability of 68.2% that the date of the flex will be at a certain date plus or minus 1 day and that the date of a substantial reduction of the number of cases will be at a certain date plus or minus 2.3 days. A 2-sigma standard deviation will give a more robust probability of 95.4% of the day of the flex and of the day of a substantial reduction in the number of cases. The 2-sigma values correspond to plus or minus 2 days for the day of the flex and plus or minus 4.6 days for the day of a substantial reduction.",
