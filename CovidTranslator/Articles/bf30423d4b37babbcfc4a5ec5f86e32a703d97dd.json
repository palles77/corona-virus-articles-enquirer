Given the fact that most existing models cannot comprehensively depict heterogeneities (e.g., the population heterogeneity and the distribution heterogeneity) and complex contagion patterns (which are mostly caused by the human interaction induced by modern transportation) in the real world, a theoretical model of the spread of infectious diseases is proposed. It employs geo-entity based cellular automata to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in a geographical environment. In the model, physical geographical regions are defined as cells. The population within each cell is divided into three classes: Susceptible, Infective, and Recovered, which are further divided into some subclasses by states of individuals. The transition rules, which determine the changes of proportions of those subclasses and reciprocal transformation formulas among them, are provided. Through defining suitable spatial weighting functions, the model is applied to simulate the spread of the infectious diseases with not only local contagion but also global contagion. With some cases of simulation, it has been shown that the results are reasonably consistent with the spread of infectious diseases in the real world. The model is supposed to model dynamics of infectious diseases on complex networks, which is nearly impossible to be achieved with differential equations because of the complexity of the problem. The cases of simulation also demonstrate that efforts of all kinds of interventions can be visualized and explored, and then the model is able to provide decision-making support for prevention and control of infectious diseases. cellular automata, infectious disease, modeling, geographic information systems, spatial weighting function",

            "text": "Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi, and can spread, directly or indirectly, from one person (or animal) to another. A serious infectious disease might cause mass deaths, social panics, or even a national crisis. Some examples of infectious diseases are the Black Death during the middle fourteenth century, the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002, and more recently, the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) [1] . In order to prevent and control infectious diseases, the study of mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases is an important issue in epidemiology. Through scientifically modeling the spread of an infectious dis-ease, some key factors that disclose the mechanism of the spread of the disease can be found out and the effect of some interventions (e.g., therapy, isolation, immunization) on the spread of the disease can be evaluated. Modeling infectious diseases using differential equations has been a popular approach. In differential equation models, the population is generally divided into three classes: Susceptible, Infective, and Recovered. The Susceptible refers to those healthy individuals who are susceptible to a certain infectious disease and are likely to be infected with the disease. The Infective refers to the individuals under infection. The Recovered refers to those who are recovered from infection with the disease and are contemporarily or permanently immune to the disease. To characterize the varying infection force of an infected individual, the infection period of a disease is further divided into three phases: incubation, when the individual is already infected and infectious but presents no symptoms; proper infection, when the individual is infectious and shows the symptoms; and latency, when the infected individual is not infectious anymore but still has the symptoms [2] . Two basic differential equation models were extensively studied. One is SIR model for modeling the infectious diseases that confer immunity to the infected individuals after recovery (e.g., measles, chickenpox, mumps, HIV, and poliomyelitis). The other is SIS model for modeling the infectious diseases that do not confer immunity to the infected individuals after recovery (e.g. meningitis, plague, venereal diseases, and malaria). Some other differential equation models are more or less adapted from SIR or SIS, such as SIRS, SEIRS and so on [3] . These models all assume that the population under study is homogeneous and the interaction among individuals is equiprobable. These assumptions are unrealistic, which are also the intrinsic drawbacks of these differential equation models, because the local characters are neglected in these models [4] . They do not include variable susceptibility of individuals, and cannot handle the complicated boundary and initial conditions [5] . Furthermore, these models are all adimensional, i.e., they can depict the changes of the number of all classes of individuals in time, but not in space.",

            "text": "Some types of methods are developed to deal with the heterogeneous characteristics. Spatial infectious disease models and Cellular Automata (CA) models are two outstanding types of them. In essence, spatial infectious disease models [6] are composed of a system of differential equations and understandably have the common shortcomings as differential equation models. However, CA models are a new kind of computational techniques for simulating the real world, introduced first by Von Neumann [7] . At first, they were mainly used for simulation of physics systems. In recent years, many researchers from all kinds of fields have had an increasing interest in them thanks to the development of the computer techniques. Some authors have applied CA to model infectious diseases [1, 2, 5, 8, 9] . They basically construct the CA based on differential equation models. By that way, some epidemiological features of an infectious disease can be expressed more directly. Moreover, CA simulation can present visual results that enable us to ascertain some key features of the spread of an infectious disease through experiment and observation. In most existing studies, CA models use cellular space that is generated by equably dividing the research area into regular lattices. And in those studies, the classic neighbor patterns, such as Moore and von Neumann neighbors, are applied and the transition rules of the CA are derived from the relevant differential equation models. These, however, have some shortcomings. First of all, the classic neighbor patterns are not suitable for some special diseases while they are suitable for characterizing the spread of some infectious diseases. SARS is one of the typical examples. The spread of SARS shows the small world characteristic [10] which is completely different from the behavior expressed by the classic neighbor patterns. On the other hand, the real background space where diseases spread comprises irregular geographical regions (which generally have different sizes and shapes), so it is also not suitable to impersonate physical geographical regions using regular lattices.",

It has some limitations with respect to the cellular shape, the neighbor pattern, and the transition rule, which constrains its ability to simulate the real world. To overcome these drawbacks, some researchers have studied the theories and applications of geographical CA [11, 12] . In this paper, we employ a geo-entity based CA model [13, 14] , which defines physical geographical regions as cells. In addition to the consideration of the epidemiological characteristics of infectious diseases (e.g., effective contact rate, recovery rate, and the varying infection force), we pay more attention to the influence of contagion patterns on the spread of infectious diseases. Two typical kinds of contagion patterns are explored. One is the local contagion good for portraying local diffusion and the other is the global contagion, which is potentially likely to express the contact behavior of infectious diseases on complex networks [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The cases of simulation for the two situations are also presented and analyzed. It has been shown that the results are reasonably consistent with the spread of infectious diseases in the real world. The model is supposed to model dynamics of infectious diseases in complex networks, which is nearly impossible to be achieved with differential equations because of the complexity of the problem. The additional cases of simulation also demonstrate that efforts of all kinds of interventions can be visualized and examined, and then the model is able to provide decision-making support for prevention and control of infectious diseases.",

Every cell is further divided into subclasses by the states of individuals. The state of every subclass will dynamically change with time. Here we assume, for a certain disease, its phases' average times are fixed. T i , T p , T l , and T r denote the average times of the incubation, proper infection, latency, and immunity respectively (unit: day). Thus, we define the state set which each subclass may go through as P={0, 1, 2,\u2026, T i +T p +T l +T r }. The subclass with state 0 consists of the individuals susceptible to the disease. The subclass with state 1 consists of the individuals on the first day of incubation, state T i +1 on the first day of proper infection,\u2026, and state T i +T p +T l +1 on the first day of immune. When the state of a subclass is T i +T p +T l +T r , which means that the individuals with the state are on the last day of the immune phase, the state of the subclass should be changed to 0 at the next step of time. Every subclass will go through each state in the state set orderly except that they are cured during the infection period. If the subclass is cured during the infection period, it will directly enter into the first day of the immune phase, i.e. its state should be changed to T i +T p +T l +1.

It suffers from the assumption of mass action, or the homogenous interaction between populations. A lot of efforts are required to relax the assumption. The paper proposes to embed CA model under SIR framework; a new effort has been made to revise SIR model and the study on the simulation and real-world cases shows that work. In this paper, a theoretical model of infectious diseases is introduced. It incorporates two main heterogeneities: population heterogeneity and distribution heterogeneity which relax the assumption of homogeneity. It employs geo-entity based CA considering physical geographical regions as cells. The model incorporates two categories of parameters (the BECR and the cured rate) that may express man's interventions, through which the evaluation of the control effect (e.g., therapy, isolation, immunization) is executable.",

            "text": "In the proposed model, the parameter correlation factor c ij reflects the force of the external interaction between region i and region j. Quantifying the variable reasonably is crucial for effective simulation of an infectious disease. A spatial weighting function is a set of rules that assign values or \"weights\" to every pair of locations in a study area and it is appropriate for quantifying the correlation factors. Based on spatial weighting functions, some new neighbor patterns can be applied in the model, which are different from those used in the classic CA and supposed to more reasonably depict the spatial interaction of infectious diseases. Consequently, the model is applicable for not only the diseases with local contagion but also ones with global contagion (e.g., SARS, Foot and mouth disease and Avian Influenza). The model has some advantages over the classic CA. It can couple cells with geographical phenomena closely. Thus, the incorporation of region related parameters, such as various attributes for geographical regions, spatial weighting functions and so on, becomes more direct and convenient. According to the model, a simulation program is developed in GIS. For two typical contagion patterns: the local contagion and the global contagion, some results of simulation are obtained. And the results show that the model is adaptable for modeling the complicated phenomena of the spread of diseases in real world, which is nearly impossible to be achieved with differential equations because of the complexity of the problem. Fur-thermore, the model couples visualization with complexity and is supposed to effectively simulate the dynamics of infectious diseases on complex networks which is unreachable with either the classic CA or analytical complex networks. In this paper, the cases of simulation considering isolation and quarantine are also presented, which demonstrate several sensible uses of the model in control and prevention of infectious diseases. The case study of Beijing SARS also shows that the simulation results of the model are in good agreement with the real disease data, which in a sense explains the applicability of the proposed model. Through visualizing and examining efforts of all kinds of interventions, the model can provide decision-making support for prevention and control of infectious diseases.",
