To further characterize the earliest apoptotic signaling events, here we treated cells with an antibody specific to the MHV receptor prior to and during virus infection or with an antibody specific to MHV spike protein following virus binding. Both treatments blocked virus infection and apoptosis, indicating that virus-receptor binding is necessary but not sufficient for the apoptosis induction. Furthermore, virus infection significantly increased the formation of the \"death-receptor complexes\" consisting of Fas, Fasassociated death domain and procaspase-8, but did not induce the complexes involving the tumor necrosis factor receptor and its associated death domain, demonstrating the specific activation of the Fas signaling pathway. Moreover, virus infection did not alter the abundance of the individual proteins of the complexes, suggesting that the activation of the Fas signaling pathway was at the post-translational level. Treatment with a Fas/Fc chimera, which blocks Fas-Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis, inhibited the formation of the complexes and blocked the activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis in MHV-infected cells. It also inhibited the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the activation of caspase-9. These results demonstrate that oligodendrocyte apoptosis is triggered by MHV infection during cell entry through the activation of the Fas signaling pathway.",

            "text": "Apoptosis is an important biologic process that regulates homeostasis, tissue development and the immune system (Nijhawan et al., 2000; Roulston et al., 1999; Wyllie, 1980) . Initiation of apoptosis usually follows cascades of signaling events or apoptotic pathways upon receipt of a variety of apoptotic signals. The most common apoptotic pathway is the \"death\" receptor-mediated signaling pathway, which involves interactions of apoptotic factors with cell surface molecules such as Fas (CD95)/Fas-ligand (Susin et al., 1997) and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)/TNF. Activation of the Fas or TNFR signaling pathway facilitates the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as Fas-associated death domain (FADD) or TNFRassociated death domain (TRADD) proteins, which in turn recruit initiator caspases (such as caspases-8/10) to form a \"death-receptor complex\" or \"pre-apoptosome\" (Hsu et al., 1996) . The procaspases in the pre-apoptosome undergo cleavage to form active caspases. Activation of initiator caspases further activates effector caspases (i.e., caspases-3/6/7), ultimately leading to apoptosis (Cohen, 1997; Hsu et al., 1996; Nijhawan et al., 2000; Strasser et al., 2000) . Another well-characterized apoptotic pathway is the mitochondria-mediated pathway, which can be activated by either extracellular or intracellular death signals (Strasser et al., 2000; Vaux et al., 1988) . Activation of the mitochondrial pathway triggers cytochrome c release, which then interacts with Apaf-1. The cytochrome c/Apaf-1 complex in turn activates the initiator caspase-9 and subsequently the effector caspase-3, leading to apoptosis (Cohen, 1997) .",

            "text": "Apoptosis can be triggered by diverse intrinsic and extrinsic signals, including virus infection. Many viruses have the ability to induce apoptosis in the host cells, which is one of the cytolytic properties of viral infections. Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an enveloped RNA virus that can infect rodents and cause enteritis, hepatitis and central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Depending on the genetic background of the virus strains and the host, the CNS diseases caused by MHV infection can vary significantly, ranging from acute fatal encephalitis to persistent infections with or without chronic demyelination (Stohlman et al., 1999) . The precise mechanism of CNS demyelination caused by MHV infection is not known, although experimental evidence strongly suggests that the immune components play an important role in initiation and progression of a robust CNS demyelination disease following MHV infection (Dandekar and Perlman, 2002; Fleming et al., 1993; Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Wang et al., 1990; Wu et al., 2000; Wu and Perlman, 1999) . In addition, apoptotic oligodendrocytes have been detected in the vicinity of demyelinating lesions of MHV-infected mice and rats (Barac-Latas et al., 1997; Schwartz et al., 2002; Wu and Perlman, 1999) . We previously observed that cultured rat oligodendrocytes were susceptible to MHV infection but that MHV replication was severely restricted (Liu et al., 2003) . Moreover, infection of the oligodendrocytes by MHV resulted in apoptotic cell death and the apoptosis was caspase dependent (Liu et al., 2003) . Subsequently, we found that the mitochondrial signaling pathway and caspase-8 were also activated by MHV infection (Liu et al., 2006) . However, the upstream signal(s) that triggers the caspase-8 activation and apoptosis has not been determined.",

To test these possibilities, we treated cells with a monoclonal antibody (termed CC1) specific to the MHV receptor (Dveksler et al., 1991) during the 1-h infection and then determined its effect on apoptosis induction. We first determined the virus titers following treatment of cells with the CC1 antibody. The result confirmed the effectiveness of the CC1 antibody treatment in blocking virus infection as evidenced by a decrease of approximately 4 log 10 in virus titer (Fig. 1A) . In a parallel experiment, when apoptosis was measured by propidium iodide (PI) staining, sub-G0/G1 cells were 19.1% and 18.3% for the live-and UV-inactivated viruses, respectively, in CC1 antibody-treated samples. These results were similar to that in CC1-treated and mock-infected cells (18.4%). However, in mock-treated and virus-infected samples, more than 60% of the cells were apoptosis-positive (Fig. 1B) . Similar results were obtained from annexin V staining (Fig. 1C) . These results indicate that the virusreceptor interaction is required for the induction of apoptosis.",

As discussed in the introduction, there are two major apoptotic signals, the Fas/FasL and the TNFR/TNF, at the cell surface. To determine whether these apoptotic pathways are triggered by MHV infection, we analyzed by Western blot the abundance of the proteins that can potentially form into a pre-apoptotic complex. The results showed that the amounts of Fas, FADD, caspase-8 and TRADD were virtually unchanged following virus-infection at 24 h p.i. as compared with those of mockinfected cells (Figs. 3A and B) , indicating that MHV infection did not activate the Fas or TNFR signaling pathway at the transcriptional and translational levels. We then performed coimmunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an antibody specific to one of the components and detected the interacting partners with antibodies to the other components in Western blot analysis. Interestingly, significantly (> 3-fold) more FADD and Fas were co-immunoprecipitated by the antibody specific to caspase-8 in both live-and UV-inactivated viruses-infected cells at 24 h p.i. as compared to those of mock-infected cells (Figs. 3C and F). Similarly, more caspase-8 protein (\u22483-fold) was coprecipitated by the antibody specific to FADD in virusinfected cells than in mock-infected cells (Figs. 3D and F) . In contrast, the amount of TRADD that was co-immunoprecipitated by the caspase-8 antibody remained similar in virusinfected and mock-infected cells (Figs. 3E and F). These results indicate that MHV infection increased the formation of the Fas/ FADD/pro-caspase-8 complex but not the TNFR/TRADD/procaspase-8 complex, suggesting the specific activation of the Fas signaling pathway by MHV infection. In addition, to determine the kinetics of the activation of the Fas signal pathway, we Cells were mock-treated or treated with the anti-MHV receptor antibody CC1 at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and were infected with MHV in the presence of the CC1 antibody for 1 h.

We found that caspase-8 was significantly activated by both liveand UV-inactivated viruses at 24 h p.i.

When the cells were treated with the caspase-8 inhibitor, the percentage of sub-G0/G1 cells decreased to 31% and 32.3%, respectively, for cells infected with live-and UV-inactivated viruses, but it was still significantly higher than that for mock-infected cells (10.5%). The differences between each group were statistically significant (p < 0.01). A similar result was obtained when the cells were stained with annexin Vat 12 h p.i. (Fig. 5C ). These results indicate that MHVinduced apoptosis of oligodendrocytes is mediated at least in part through the activation of caspase-8. The data also indicate that the activation of caspase-8 is most likely mediated during virus entry and does not require viral replication since both liveand UV-inactivated viruses were capable of activating the caspase-8 and inducing apoptosis to a similar extent.",

Similarly, the number of sub-G0/G1-phase cells decreased significantly in virus-infected cells (from 65.1% to 29.4% for live-virusinfected cells and from 64.9% to 28.1% for UV-inactivated virus-infected cells) following the chimera treatment (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6B) . There was also a slight decrease in cell numbers in sub-G0/G1 phase for mock-infected cells (from 13.9% to 8.1%, Fig. 2B ), which may suggest that spontaneous apoptosis of oligodendrocytes can also be inhibited by Fas/Fc treatment.

We have begun to address this issue in the current study by determining which events in the virus life cycle trigger the Fas signaling pathway. Because infection with UV-inactivated virus can activate apoptosis (Liu et al., 2003 ; this work), it is most likely that events during virus entry trigger the apoptosis. Therefore, we have specifically sought to determine whether the initial step of virus entry (i.e., virus-receptor binding), the second step (i.e., virus-cell fusion) or both trigger the observed apoptosis. We employed two complementary approaches. The first was to use a neutralizing antibody to the viral receptor. Treatment of cells with the receptor antibody demonstrated that virus-receptor binding was necessary for triggering the apoptosis but that receptorantibody binding did not induce apoptosis since uninfected At 24 h p.i., caspase-8 activity in the cell lysates was detected with a caspase colorimetric protease assay kit using specific substrates as described in Materials and methods. The caspase-8 activity from virusinfected cells was expressed as means \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments and as fold increase over that from mock-infected control, which was set as 1-fold.

This interpretation is supported by the second experiment in which apoptosis was also blocked by a neutralizing anti-spike protein antibody even though the virus was pre-bound to the receptor (Fig. 2) . This suggests that receptor binding alone is not sufficient for the apoptosis induction. Therefore, the second step (i.e., fusion) is likely involved in triggering the apoptosis. Consistent with this interpretation is our previous finding that when the endosomal pH was elevated by ammonium chloride, chloroquine or bafilomycin A1, all of which do not block virus-receptor binding but block virus-endosomal membrane fusion for the pH-dependent mutant MHV, OBLV60 (Gallagher et al., 1991) , apoptosis was inhibited (Liu et al., 2003) . In addition, the neutralizing antibody was shown to also inhibit virus-cell fusion (Fleming et al., 1983; Ramakrishna et al., 2003) . Taken together, these findings suggest that the virus fusion during entry likely initiates the apoptotic signal, i.e., Fas activation. However, the mechanistic detail of this activation remains to be further investigated.",

Furthermore, we have identified that Fas is the most upstream apoptotic signal that is activated by MHV infection. This conclusion is supported by three pieces of evidence. First, the activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis following MHV infection were blocked by treatment of cells with an inhibitory soluble receptor (Fas/Fc chimera) prior to and during virus infection (Fig. 6) . Second, there was a significant (> 3-fold) increase of the death receptor complexes consisting of Fas, FADD and procaspase-8 following MHV infection, which were completely blocked by treatment of cells with the Fas/Fc soluble receptor (Figs. 3 and 4) . The death receptor complexes began to increase at 12 h p.i. (Fig. 3G) , at which time point apoptosis began to be detectable, albeit at a low level (Liu et al., 2003) . Third, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytoplasm or the activation of caspase-9 caused by MHV infection was prevented by treatment of cells with the Fas/Fc soluble receptor (Fig. 7) . These findings thus establish that the Fas activation is the primary apoptotic signal triggered by MHV infection. Interestingly, although caspase-8 can be usually activated by both Fas and TNFR, the TNFR signal pathway did not appear to be activated by MHV infection. In no instance was an increased amount of TRADD detected in the death receptor complexes by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3) . Thus, it appears that MHV infection specifically activates the Fas signaling pathway in the oligodendrocytes. It is noted that the relatively high background of the pre-apoptotic complexes in mock-infected cells shown in Figs. 3 and 4 was likely due to two chief reasons. First, the total protein amounts for each sample in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment were > 20 times higher than those used in the Western blot alone (see Fig. 3A ). It is very likely that if a much lower amount of the proteins were used for immunoprecipitation, the background protein complexes for the mock-infected cells would be below the detectable level. Second, terminally differentiated CG-4 oligodendrocytes usually undergo apoptosis at a low level (below 20%), which may contribute to the background complex formation. Nevertheless, the increase in the amount of the Fas/FADD/caspase-8 complexes following virus infection was significant under the same experimental conditions.",

            "text": "We previously reported that the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was triggered in part through the activation of caspase-8 and the cleavage of Bid, but it was also in part independent of the caspase-8 pathway (Liu et al., 2006) . The latter conclusion was based on the finding that cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activity were only partially inhibited by the treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor (Liu et al., 2006) . Here we showed that treatment with the caspase-8 inhibitor also only partially blocked the apoptosis induced by virus infection (from \u2248 75% to \u2248 35% annexin V-positive), which was still much higher than that in mock-infected, untreated cells (\u2248 17% annexin V-positive) (Fig. 5C ). However, higher concentrations of the caspase-8 inhibitor, which completely inhibited the caspase-8 activity, did not significantly increase the effectiveness on inhibiting apoptosis (data not shown). Thus, it is possible that MHV-induced apoptosis is via both caspase-8dependent and -independent pathways. This may be explained in part by the results that show that treatment of cells with the Fas/Fc soluble receptor exerted greater inhibitory effect on apoptosis (\u2248 70% reduction) than that with the caspase-8 inhibitor (\u2248 55% reduction) when apoptosis was measured with annexin V staining at an earlier time (at 12 h p.i.) (compare Fig.  6C with Fig. 5C ). This may suggest that the activation of the Fas signaling pathway not only activates the caspase-8 pathway but also some other downstream pathways. Although we have not yet examined the other pathways, one candidate pathway that can be potentially triggered upon Fas activation is the Daxx. Like FADD, Daxx binds to the death domains of Fas and activates a FADD-independent death pathway that involves the stress-activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (Yang et al., 1997) . Phosphorylated JNK can either activate p53 or inhibit Bcl-2, leading to apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway. This or UV-inactivated virus (UV-V) or mock-infected (Mock) and were either untreated (\u2212) or treated with the Fas/Fc chimera. At 24 h p.i., cells were harvested and the cytosolic (cytosol.) and mitochondrial (mito.) fractions were separated by differential centrifugation using cytochrome c release assay kit as described in Materials and methods. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected by Western blot analysis. Cytochrome c was detected in Western blot with a cytochrome c-specific antibody included in the kit. The amount of each protein band was quantified by densitometric analysis with the UPV software. The efficiency of release of cytochrome c from mitochondrial fraction into cytosolic fraction was expressed as a ratio of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction to mitochondrial fraction (C:M) shown at the bottom of the panel. (B) Inhibition of caspase-9 activity by the Fas/Fc chimera. Cells were infected with MHV and treated with the Fas/Fc chimera as described in panel A. At 12 h p.i., caspase-9 activity in the cell lysates was detected with a caspase colorimetric protease assay kit using specific substrates as described in Materials and methods. The caspase-9 activity from virus-infected cells was expressed as means \u00b1 SD from three independent experiments and as fold increase over that from mockinfected control, which was set as 1-fold. may explain why the caspase-8 inhibitor cannot completely block the translocation of Bax and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway induced by MHV-infection (Liu et al., 2006) . Such a possibility warrants further investigation.",

During the initiation of virus infection, the spike proteins interact with MHV receptor, which then induces cleavage and conformational change of the spike protein, leading to fusion between viral envelope and cytoplasma membrane. The fusion and/or post-fusion events trigger the activation of the Fas apoptotic signaling pathway by a yet undefined mechanism. Activation of the Fas signaling pathway facilitates the recruitment of FADD and procaspase-8 into the death receptor complexes, leading to activation of the caspase-8. Activation of caspase-8 further activates the effector caspases, leading to apoptosis and the cleavage of Bid. Cleaved Bid then translocates to mitochondria, leading to the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which in turn leads to the release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-9. The activation of caspase-9 further activates the effector caspases, leading to apoptosis and the mitochondria via a positive feedback mechanism. MHV infection of oligodendrocytes may also activate an alternative, minor (Daxx \u2192 JNK \u2192 p53 \u2192 Bax \u2192 mitochondria) pathway following the activation of Fas, although much of this pathway remains to be established experimentally. It is worth noting, however, that the findings from in vitro-differentiated CG-4 cell lines might not faithfully reflect on the in vivo situation, which requires further testing in animals.",

Under a conditional culture medium, CG-4 cell maintains its undifferentiated progenitor phenotype indefinitely (Liu et al., 2003) . Under a defined culture condition, CG-4 cells differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes as evidenced by the appearance of myelin basic protein (Liu et al., 2003) . Mature oligodendrocytes are susceptible to MHV infection. However, virus replication was severely restricted in the mature oligodendrocytes; only < 1% of the cells exhibited strong expression of viral antigens at 24 h p.i. (Liu et al., 2003) . Mature oligodendrocytes were thus used for virus infection throughout this study. The mouse astrocytoma DBT cells (Hirano et al., 1974) were cultured in Eagles Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) and used for virus propagation and virus plaque assay (Liu et al., 2003) . Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM was obtained from Dr. Michael Lai's laboratory (University of Southern California School of Medicine). All virus preparations were purified through sucrose cushion and the virus titer was determined by plaque assay on DBT cells as described previously (Liu et al., 2003) . A multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 was used throughout this study. Caspase-8 inhibitor (2-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-CH2F) was purchased from CalBiochem and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Its cytotoxicity was determined in oligodendrocytes and a non-cytotoxic concentration was used for all subsequent experiments. The recombinant rat Fas/Fc chimera (Cat.# 2159-FA, R and D Systems, Inc.) was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and was used at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml. A monoclonal antibody specific to MHV receptor CC1 was kindly provided by Dr. Kay Holmes (University of Colorado at Denver) (Dveksler et al., 1991) . Monoclonal antibodies to MHV spike protein J2.6 and J7.2 were a gift of Dr. John Fleming (University of Wisconsin at Madison), and their properties were characterized as described (Fleming et al., 1983; Ramakrishna et al., 2003) .
