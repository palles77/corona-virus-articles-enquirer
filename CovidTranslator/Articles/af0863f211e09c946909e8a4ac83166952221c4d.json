This year was to be the \"super year\" for sustainability, a year of strengthening global actions to accelerate the transformations required for achieving the 2030 agenda. We argue that 2020 can and must be a year of both. Thus we call for more utilisation of the health-emergency disaster risk management (Health-EDRM) framework to complement current responses to COVID-19 and the patent risk of similar phenomena in the future. To make our case, we examine current responses to COVID-19 and their implications for the SFDRR. We argue that current mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, as outlined in the SFDRR, can enhance responses to epidemics or global pandemics such as COVID-19. In this regard, we make several general and DRRspecific recommendations. These recommendations concern knowledge and science provision in understanding disaster and health-related emergency risks, the extension of disaster risk governance to manage both disaster risks and potential health-emergencies, particularly for humanitarian coordination aspects; and the strengthening of communitylevel preparedness and response.",

Moreover, SDG 3 is devoted to \"good health and well-being\", with an emphasis on \"early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks\" (UN, 2015) . For its part, the Paris Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report highlights that climate change exacerbates health risks including pandemics (see e.g. [4, 5] ). The recently edited book by Chan and Shaw [6] on Public Health and Disasters is timely since it highlights the progress and importance of the Health-EDRM framework adopted by the WHO in 2019. Health-EDRM refers to the \"systematic analysis and management of health risks, posed by emergencies and disasters, through a combination of (1) hazard and vulnerability reduction to prevent and mitigate risks, (2) preparedness, (3) response and (4) recovery measures\" (WHO 2019). Health-EDRM is thus an umbrella term, which the WHO uses to refer to the broad intersection of health and disaster risk management (DRM). It also comprises such areas as emergency and disaster medicine, bolstered health systems and resilience, disaster risk reduction, humanitarian response, and community health resilience [7] .",

We examine ongoing efforts to respond to COVID-19 and these efforts' implications for the Sendai Framework. Our analysis reveals specific areas of rapid response to COVID-19. But we find lamentably few actions by DRRrelated organisations, in spite of the SFDRR's call for building resilience to biological hazards. Moreover, the current WHO-led coordinated response reveals little implementation of the WHO Thematic Platform for Health-EDRM adopted in 2019. Existing mechanisms and strategies for disaster resilience, such as those detailed in the SFDRR, offer concrete means to respond effectively to epidemics and even global pandemics such as COVID- 19 .

The UNDRR asked national disaster management agencies to continue with the development of their preparedness and response capacities to include health emergencies as a top priority, alongside earthquakes, floods, storms and other natural hazards (UNDRR, 2020). It also highlighted the importance of silo-breaking in disaster prevention and management, notably the silos between disaster management and health workers. The UNDRR reiterates that the Sendai Framework emphasizes the need for resilient health systems and the integration of disaster risk management into health care provision at all levels. After all, Sendai turns the focus from disaster response and management to preparedness, surveillance and disaster risk management in the health context (UNDRR, 2020). Yet it is not clear whether COVID-19 is leading to collaboration between the WHO and the UNDRR. We appraise the speed and scale by which COVID-19 response funds are made available. International funding organisations, regional government bodies and private entities have proposed major financial measures. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) made $50 billion in loans available to deal with the coronavirus, including $10 billion of zero-interest loans to the poorest IMF member countries (IMF, 2020). The EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a \u20ac25 billion coronavirus investment fund for the health care sector, labour market and SMEs (EU, 2020). The World Bank Group increases COVID-19 Response to $14 billion to help sustain economies and protect jobs. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) announces $6.5 billion initial response to COVID-19 pandemic (ADB, 2020). The UN announced $15 million dollars from the UN's Central Emergency Fund to help fund global efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, particularly vulnerable countries with weak health care systems (UN, 2020). It is important to note that in the SFDRR, investment and finance are at the core of Sendai Framework, in terms of the resilience investment needed for countries and communities.",

The EU has established a common European response to the outbreak of COVID-19, focusing on public health sectors and socio-economic impact particularly mobility and economy in the European Union (EU, 19th March 2020). Italy is the most severely impacted country in the EU. The EC support for the Sendai Framework identifies health as one of the issues interlinked with DRR (EC Web, 2020). Yet it is unclear whether the EU response to COVID-19 features coordinated involvement by DRR-related agencies and mechanisms. The opportunity for integration may be possible through the Integrated Political Crisis Response (IPCR). The IPRC provides a flexible crisis mechanism for supporting the presidency of the Council of the European Union in dealing with major natural or man-made crosssectorial disasters, as well as acts of terrorism. The IPCR works through common Monitoring and Information-sharing (EU, 2016).",

The ASEAN was established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand, with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) by Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. The ASEAN now includes 10 member countries and coordinates regional action. Concerning COVID-19, ASEAN has issued ASEAN Health Sector Efforts in the Prevention, Detection and Response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (ASEAN, 2020). Guided by the ASEAN Post-2015 Health Development Agenda (APHDA) and its Governance and Implementation Mechanism (GIM), the ASEAN Health Sector Cooperation deployed and operationalized the established and existing health mechanisms for technical exchanges, information sharing, and updates on policy-related measures in responding to COVID-19. ASEAN specialised agencies involved are the ASEAN Emergency Operations Centre Network for public health emergencies (ASEAN EOC Network), ASEAN Senior Officials for Health Development (SOMHD) of ASEAN and China, Japan and Republic of Korea (Plus Three Countries), and ASEAN BioDioaspora Regional Virtual Centre (ABVC) (ASEAN, 2020). There is no indication that the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre) is involved in the ASEAN's response to COVID-19. AHA Centre is an inter-governmental organisation which aims to facilitate cooperation and coordination among ASEAN Member States and with the United Nations and international organisations for disaster management and emergency response in ASEAN region. Leadership is beyond the mandate of the AHA Center (see https://ahacentre.org/about-us/). But its plethora of existing mechanisms can and should be used. These mechanisms include the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), the Standard Operating Procedure for Regional Standby Arrangements and Coordination of Joint Disaster Relief and Emergency Response Operations (SASOP), the ASEAN Joint Disaster Response Plan (AJDRP), the Disaster Emergency Logistics System for ASEAN (DELSA), the Emergency Response and Assessment Team (ERAT), the ASEAN Regional Disaster Emergency Response Simulation Exercise (ARDEX), ASEAN-ERAT (ASEAN-Emergency Response and Assessment Team) and the AHA Centre Executive (ACE) Programme (REF). Globally, the ASEAN region is one of the most vulnerable to disasters, and the AHA Center has been praised for its role in strengthening DRM in the region (e.g. [9, 10] ). These competencies surely ought to be deployed in addressing the rapid emergence of COVID-19 as well as building resilience against a repeat.",

India's Prime Minister initiated the conference, calling upon SAARC leaders to work collectively to fight the spread of the pandemic in the region. India called for the creation of a COVID-19 Emergency Fund, with voluntary contributions from all Member States. India itself pledged US$ 10 million as an initial contribution. There is no further information available. To be sure, SAARC developed a Comprehensive Framework on Disaster Management and Disaster Prevention in 2005 and established a number of SAARC centres, chiefly the SAARC Centre for Disaster Management and Preparedness (SDMC) to implement the framework. Yet progress to build the DRM capacities of South Asian states through regional cooperation has been slow (Brookings-LSE, 2015).

Complex issues of governance and strict regulation complicated the initial response, leading to a wide spread of the COVID-19 among the passengers and crew. Subsequently, COVID-19 began being reported in persons returning to Japan from abroad, mainly from China. The Hokkaido region is particularly affected. An epidemic cluster approach has marked the Japanese government's response, limiting testing. A strict government response followed, including school closures from early March, telework from home, flexible working time to avoid crowded trains, and an epidemic cluster approach. Communities and people followed this \"request\" from the government (which was not compulsory) apparently limiting the spread of COVID-19 and the number of deaths. Thus, the combination of government request and strong selfdiscipline within people and communities has evidently led to desirable results. The dedicated website http://japan.kantei.go.jp/index.html provides timely updates from the Prime Minister, with Japan having passed two packages of small business loans, one $4.6 billion package in February, and a $15 billion one on March 11, 2020.",

These methods can be utilised for COVID-19 risk assessment. In addition, the health sciences should be more involved in the community of disaster risk management, to advance our understanding of outbreaks and pandemics, the health impacts of all hazards, and improve data collection [15] . Science is recognised especially in modelling disease spread, data on affected people, and the rush for vaccines. Open data, Open Science and Open Map are being advocated. Existing spatial and remote sensing capacity for disaster can be used for mapping pandemics. The UN-SPIDER (Spacebased Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response) knowledge portal recognises epidemics as a source of hazard. The existing regional tsunami early warning systems can also be tasked for healthrelated emergencies. The systems include the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC); the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System (IOTWS); and the North Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and connected Seas (NEAMTWS). There is strong recognition for integration on DRR and CCA and appropriate adaptation can greatly reduce the health burden resulting from climate change and disasters [16] . The Sendai Framework takes an interconnected and pluralistic approach to understanding risk (UNDRR, 2019). The nature of current risks is complex and systemic, and can also be compound, interconnected, infracting and cascading risks [17] . Natural, technological and biological hazard disasters can occur in these fashions, as shown in the triple disasters of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant failure in March 11, 2011 in Japan. Countries like Japan, or Indonesia, despite having to respond to current COVID-19, they also need to be ready should an earthquake or tsunami occur.",

The economic fall-out from COVID-19 appears to be profound, at least $20 trillion in a few short weeks, and may exceed the 2008-2009 Great Recession. The direct costs of COVID-19 travel bans, social distancing, and other responses are merely one aspect. Far more devastating is the uncertainty that has gripped capital markets. Declining economic activity and large drops in capital markets have a mutually reinforcing impact, undermining the capacity of heavily indebted businesses and households to cover their debts. Uncertainty is the primary driver of such crises, and stems in large measure from lack of close coordination and science-based decision-making. Were there more certainty, households, investors and other economic agents would be less inclined to panic. COVID-19 appears certain to become a very costly lesson that DRR does indeed save many more multiples in avoided costs than its initial investment. An additional point in this regard is that health is a critical infrastructure. The resilience of critical infrastructure is well identified in DRR literature (e.g. [18, 19] ). Resilience is fostered not just by sciencebased decisions and coordination, but also via redundancy to ensure buffer capacity when a particular system collapses [20] . Disaster-illiterate economic policy tends to see redundancy as inefficiency. But in order to cope with COVID-19 and alleviate -if not prevent -future emergencies, supply chains for at least some critical items need to be more local. In tandem, governments and private businesses will have to broaden their crisis planning to ensure timely availability of items essential to limiting pandemic risks.",

Introduction: SFDRR and Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (Health-EDRM) COVID-19 has rapidly morphed into an unprecedented health, economic and geopolitical crisis. It surely underscores the imperative of accelerating the integration of multiple global policy frameworks, not least those at the centre of the 2030 Agenda. Prior to the emergence of COVID-19, the UN Secretary General had positioned 2020 as the \"super year\" for action on sustainability (UN, 2020). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and the New Urban Agenda, alongside the SFDRR were all adopted in 2015-2016. March 18th, 2020 marks the fifth anniversary of implementation of the 2015-2030 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR).",
