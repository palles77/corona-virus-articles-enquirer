Six and twelve hours after inoculation, before diarrhea, extensive specific viral immunofluorescence and viral particles on electron microscopy were seen in villus but not crypt enterocytes in jejunum, mid-intestine, and ileum. At 24 and 40 hr, when diarrhea was most severe, immunofluorescence was patchy; villus blunting (P < 0.001) and increased crypt depth (P < 0.001) were observed by light microscopy in all segments; radioautographically labeled enterocytes showed accelerated migration and shortened life span; and cells on villi were deficient in sucrase activity (P < 0.001) and",

At the height of diarrhea, when enterocyte turnover is maximal, the epithelium consists predominantly of immature virus-free cells which have migrated to the villi in a relatively undifferentiated state.",

' -s The present experiments used an immunofluorescence technique to determine the timing and extent of viral invasion during the course of experimental TGE infection. These findings were related to the development of functional and structural abnormalities in the small intestinal epithelium. When administered to young pigs under standardized conditions, we found previously that the TGE virus consistently caused diarrhea beginning at about 18 hr, peaking at 40 hr after which it subsided.1.2 .\u2022 Pensaert et al. have shown invasion of the epithelium within 6 hr and shedding of infected cells within 24 hr. 7 We suspect that the im- ",

Groups of animals were killed at intervals of 6-144 hr after infection and intestine taken from 3 sites-proximal jejunum (5-15 cm from ligament of Treitz), mid small intestine (10 cm around midpoint), and ileum (5-65 cm from ileocecal sphincter). In'the first study at 6, 12, 24, 30, 40, 72 , and 144 hr, we examined epithelial viral immunofluorescence (IF) and mucosal structure at all three sites and measured sucrase and thymidine kinase activities in isolated villus cells from the ileal segment. Viral TGE antigen was detected by direct IF, using a fluorescein-conjugated porcine anti-TGE globulin (used for IF diagnosis of field cases, and kindly donated by Dr. A. Gagnon, University of Guelph). Specificity was tested by twostage inhibition using TGE-inoculated and noninfected Ileal villus enterocytes were isolated selectively with a vibration technique that excludes crypt cells,'o and the presence of intact crypts was confirmed by microscope examination of tissue after the isolation procedure. For enzyme analyses, cells were homogenized and stored at -20\u00b0C for assays of thymidine kinase and sucrase activity.' In the second study, enterocyte migration in proximal jejunum and ileum was measured by autoradiography. Piglets were injected with [3H]thymidine (0.3 /LCi/g) , and subgroups were killed 6, 12, or 24 hr later so that migration of labeled cells could be measured in relation to mucosal structure. Migration was studied during three stages of the disease (0-24, 36-60, and 120-144 hr) and compared with control data, using six-eight piglets for each study period. Samples of intestine from each site were oriented on wax, fixed in Bouin's reagent for 12 hr, transferred to 95% alcohol, and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections ( Coded sections were examined with a calibrated eyepiece by one person, who selected from each section (excluding areas over Peyer's patches) 10-30 longitudinally well-oriented crypt-villus columns with the lumen in continuity. Crypt-villus column height and the distance of foremost labeled cells (FLC) from crypt base were measured; in addition, to allow for changes in column height, the mean position of FLC was expressed as a percentage of column height. Migration rates were expressed as change in position of FLC per hour, and the mean enterocyte transit time (time taken for label to reach the villus tips) was calculated for each stage of the disease. Results were analyzed with Student's t-test. Analyses of enzyme data were based on the assumption of a logarithmic distribution for the data, and the results were expressed as antilogarithms.",

In both jejunum and ileum, mean distance from crypt base was significantly greater than the corresponding control measurement 6 hr after labeling in the TGE-infected groups studied at 36 and 120 hr after infection (P < 0.001). In those given label 36 hr after infection, the foremost label at 6 and 12 hr was significantly further from the crypt base than in those studied earlier (0-24 hr) and later (120-144 hr) in the disease (P < 0.001, respectively); in fact, at this stage of the disease the label had reached the tips of villi within 24 hr of injection. When FLC position was expressed as a percentage of column height, allowing for ob- served changes in column height, similar differences were observed in both segments ( Table 3) . As indicated in the table, these data are reflected in the migration rates, expressed as distance traveled by the foremost-labeled cell per hour. In TGE, migration rates greatly exceeded control values, particularly in the 36-60 hr infected group (TGE, 16.7 and 12.7 vs. control, 8.9 and 7.0 J.L/hr in jejunum and ileum, respectively). The estimated time taken for foremost labeled cells to reach the villus tips was markedly reduced in both jejunum and ileum during TGE, related both to a significant increase in migration as previously indicated, and to a significant reduction in total crypt-villus column height at certain stages of infection (Table 3) . For example, the enterocyte transit time or life span was 55 hr in control jejunum, compared with 18 hr for cells labeled 36 hr after infection in TGE. During this study period, the measurements of column height were all significantly less than control measurements (P < 0.001).",

Because the virus is absent from the epithelium of the resulting mucosal lesion, we assume that the infected cells have been shed at that stage, replaced by relatively undifferentiated enterocytes as judged by structural and enzymatic criteria, and not reinfected by virus. As others have noted,7 villus cells seem particularly susceptible to invasion by the TGE virus. Many factors could be involved in this apparent resistance of less differentiated crypttype enterocytes to virus invasion. On electron microscopy, we observed viral particles actually traversing intact microvilli of mature epithelial cells; perhaps a brush-border receptor is synthesized as enterocytes differentiate in the course of their migration from crypt to villus tip.",

The pathogenesis of this proliferation is unknown, but a negative feedback from mature villus epithelium has been postulated in normal mucosa.\" As the replacement enterocytes migrate, they have a shortened life span and at the peak of disease fail to differentiate fully. The findings of defective differentiation and shortened life span strongly support the concept that, at the height of diarrhea, the renewed epithelium in TGE consists predominantly of immature cells.1.4\u00b77 Clearly, the abnormalities in transport function which reflect an alterated balance between immature crypt and mature villus cells cannot be attributed directly to the presence of virus. Several acute viral intestinal infections affecting the young of various species appear to follow the sequence just outlined for TGE, with invasion and desquamation of mature villus cells, leading to a mucosal lesion and to diarrhea coincident with epithelial regeneration. These include coronavirus enteritis of dogs '3 and calves\" and rotavirus enteritis of piglets,\"5 lambs,'6 and calves.17 Our recent experience with human rotavirus enteritis induced in pig-lets!8 leads us to believe that a similar sequence of events may occur in the human condition. Because this epithelial response is central to the pathogenesis of diarrhea caused by viral invasion, factors that influence mucosal renewal such as age, drugs, and nutrition '9 . 2o may be significant determinants of recovery from these diseases.",
