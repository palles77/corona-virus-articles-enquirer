C57BL/6N mice (7-week-old) were divided into four groups. Each group composed of control, dextran sodium sulfate-treated (DSS), C. rodentiuminfected (CT), and DSS-treated and C. rodentium-infected (DSS-CT) mice. The DSS group was administered 1% DSS in drinking water for 7 days. The CT group was supplied with normal drinking water for 7 days and subsequently infected with C. rodentium via oral gavage. The DSS-CT group was supplied with 1% DSS in drinking water for 7 days and subsequently infected with C. rodentium via oral gavage. The mice were sacrificed 10 days after the induction of C. rodentium infection. The DSS-CT group displayed significantly shorter colon length, higher spleen to body weight ratio, and higher histopathological score compared to the other three groups. The mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interferon (INF)-\u03b3 were significantly upregulated; however, those of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were significantly downregulated in the DSS-CT group than in the control group. These results demonstrated that a combination of low DSS concentration (1%) and C. rodentium infection could effectively induce inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. This may potentially be used as a novel IBD model, in which colitis is induced in mice by the combination of a chemical and a pathogen.",

Due to their simplicity in induction and reproducibility, the chemically induced murine intestinal inflammation models developed using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, oxazolone, acetic acid, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used (Randhawa et al., 2014) . Especially, the DSS-induced IBD model is widely used because of its simplicity and similarities with human IBD (Kim et al., 2012; Chassaing et al., 2014) . DSS is a water-soluble, negatively charged, sulfated polysaccharide, with molecular weight ranging from 5 to 1,400 kDa (Chassaing et al., 2014) . The molecular weight of DSS is an important factor in the induction of colitis in mice and rats, and most severe colitis results from the use of ~40-50 kDa DSS (Hirono et al., 1983; Axelsson et al., 1996; Kitajima et al., 2000) . Generally, DSS at a concentration of 2-5% is administrated after dissolving it in drinking water, which produces either acute or chronic colitis depending on the experimental protocol (Chassaing et al., 2014) . Administration of DSS results in symptoms like loose stool, diarrhea, bloody feces, body weight loss, mucosal ulceration, and shortening of the colon and rectum (Kwon et al., 2005) . In DSS-induced colitis, cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 were upregulated (Randhawa et al., 2014) .",

Enteropathogenic Escherichia (A) Forty mice were divided into four groups (10 mice/group) and pretreated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), or normal drinking water for 1 week, and subsequently inoculated with C. rodentium or fresh LB broth. The mice were sacrificed 10 days after the induction of C. rodentium infection. (B) The body weight was measured every day and was plotted as the percentage of the initial body weight of the mouse. The data are expressed as the mean (** P < 0.01, compared to the control and DSS groups).",

Whereas both EPEC and EHEC are poorly pathogenic in the mouse intestinal epithelial cells, C. rodentium is a much better A/E-lesion-forming pathogen compared to E. coli. C. rodentium infection results in the depletion of goblet cells, crypt cell hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and significant intestinal barrier disruption in mouse models (Luperchio and Schauer, 2001; Mundy et al., 2005) . C. rodentium-infected mice develop various pathologies depending on their age, genetic background, diet, and indigenous microbiota (Mundy et al., 2005) . C. rodentium infection in the suckling and immunodeficient mice results in the development of colitis, characterized by diarrhea, rectal prolapse, and other clinical signs including retarded growth, listlessness, dehydration, and mortality (in severe cases) (Luperchio and Schauer, 2001; Ryu et al., 2016) . In contrast, the infection in adult mice is subclinical and self-limiting, resulting in considerably less morbidity or mortality (Maaser et al., 2004) . Therefore, it is difficult to induce colitis using C. rodentium in adult mice.",

            "text": "Although numerous colitis models induced using DSS have been developed, susceptibility to DSS depends on the species of animal used. In mice and rats, colitis develops primarily in the colon; however, in guinea pigs, the lesions develop mainly in the cecum (Okayasu et al., 1990; Iwanaga et al., 1994; Hoshi et al., 1996) . Additionally, the symptoms of colitis also vary according to the molecular weight of DSS used (Chassaing et al., 2014) . Acute or chronic colitis is usually induced by continuous administration of 2-5% DSS for 4-9 days or by cyclic DSS treatment (Kwon et al., 2005; Per\u0161e and Cerar, 2012) . We used both, a chemical and a pathogen, to induce murine colitis. Unlike previous studies, we treated mice with a very low dose (1%) of DSS and C. rodentium. Thus, in this study, we established a novel model for IBD induced using both DSS and C. rodentium. IBD is becoming increasingly prevalent and affects about 90-300 per 100,000 people worldwide (Casati and Toner, 2000) . Although it occurs at any age, the peak age for the on-set of IBD is 15 to 30 years. The symptoms of IBD include chronic uncontrolled inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, which can affect all parts of the gastrointestinal tract (Andres and Friedman, 1999; Hanauer, 2006) . However, the mechanism by which DSS induces colitis has not yet been elucidated. Interestingly, various studies have shown that DSS administration induces toxic effects on the colonic epithelium, causes alteration of the luminal bacterial flora, and activation of T cell-, B cell-, and macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses (Okayasu et al., 1990; Yamada et al., 1992; Ohkusa et al., 1995) . The clinically significant pathogenic strains EPEC and EHEC, have also been linked to IBD. EPEC and EHEC are known to induce A/E lesions, which intimately attach to the apical host cell membrane of the cecal and colonic epithelium, thereby forming a non-invasive pedestal-like structure (Eckmann, 2006) . However, mice are not susceptible to EPEC and EPEC infections. C. rodentium, an A/E pathogen, is the causative agent for transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia, a naturally occurring disease in mice (Luperchio and Schauer, 2001; Mundy et al., 2005) . Oral C. rodentium infection in mice causes transient colonization of the cecum, progresses to the distal colon 2 to 3 days after infection, and peaks after 1 week. Subsequently, the infection gets cleared over the next 2-3 weeks (MacDonald et al., 2003; Eckmann, 2006) . C. rodentium-induced typhlitis or colitis is difficult to induce in adult mice and some mouse strains, which are resistant to C. rodentium infection (Simmons et al., 2002) .",

Following pretreatment with 1% DSS and infection using 1.6 \u00d7 10 9 CFU of C. rodentium, a successful IBD model was not established because 60% mice died (Supplementary data Fig. S2 ). In this study, we successfully developed a colitis model using 7-week-old C57BL/6N adult mice.

Hypertrophy of spleen, hyperplasia, and shortening of the large intestine have been observed in the TLR2-deficient mice infected with C. rodentium (Gibson et al., 2008) . Consistent with the previous reports, in the DSS-CT group, the spleen to body weight ratio significantly increased and colon length significantly shortened compared to the other three groups. Disrupted cell morphological characteristics were observed in the C. rodentium-infected mice, with loss of goblet cells, mucosal hyperplasia, and dramatic infiltration of inflammatory cells into the mucosa and submucosa (Luperchio and Schauer, 2001) .",

            "text": "Histopathologically, loss of crypts, infiltration of inflammatory cells into the mucosa and submucosa, submucosal edema, erosion, and ulceration have been observed in murine colitis induced by DSS (Kitajima et al., 2000) . Consistent with the previous observations, significant depletion of goblet cells, mucosal hyperplasia, and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in the mid and distal colon regions of the DSS-CT group mice compared to the mice in the other three groups. These results suggested that C. rodentium infection, following administration of DSS, causes morphological alterations in the colon. IFN-\u03b3, predominantly produced by the T and natural killer (NK) cells, acts as mediator for macrophage activation and immunological responses (Flynn et al., 1993) . Both TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 are proinflammatory cytokines that have diverse biological effects, including cytolysis, cytotoxicity, immunoregulation, cellular proliferation, and antiviral responses. Thus, their action further worsens the disease condition (Yu et al., 2009) . IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine predominantly produced by the monocytes, macrophages, and other cells including the type 2 T helper cells and B cells (Moore et al., 2001) . Interestingly, IL-6, which is primarily produced by the T cells, B cells, monocytes, and PMNs, acts as a pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine during immune responses (Scheller et al., 2011) . The mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1\u03b2 in the colon were significantly higher in the C57BL/6 mice with colitis that was induced using 2 or 2.5% DSS compared to the untreated control group mice (Ouyang et al., 2012; Sang et al., 2016) . Contrary to the previous studies, the mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 in the spleen did not change in the 1% DSS group; however, the mRNA levels of IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1\u03b2 dramatically decreased in the 1% DSS group compared to the levels in the control group. This may be due to the concentration of DSS used and duration of its administration. In our colitis model induced using both DSS and C. rodentium, the mRNA expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 were significantly higher in the DSS-CT group than in the other three groups. In contrast, the mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly lower in the DSS-CT group than in the control and CT groups. These data showed that low concentration of DSS, and not C. rodentium infection, inhibited the expression of cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-10. However, in our novel model, increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, namely TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, was due to C. rodentium infection. These results suggested that in our colitis model, the immunological balance between pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines was maintained. Thus, this was a novel animal model of IBD. In summary, we administrated a low concentration (1%) of DSS to 7-week-old adult mice for 7 days, and subsequently infected them with C. rodentium via oral gavage. The mice showed less body weight gain, shortened colon length, increased spleen weight, and severe histopathological lesions (including depletion of goblet cells, mucosal hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell infiltration). The expression levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 increased, and those of IL-6 and IL-10 decreased in the DSS-CT group compared to the control group. In conclusion, a novel murine IBD model was effectively developed by the combination of low concentration (1%) of DSS and C. rodentium infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrated the induction of colitis in mice using the combination of a chemical and a pathogen.",
