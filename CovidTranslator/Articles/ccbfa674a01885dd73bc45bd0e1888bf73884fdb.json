            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have been reported in more than 50 countries and territories since 2015 (1), with more than 3,000 confirmed infections in fetuses (2) . ZIKV, a positive-stranded RNA virus, can transmit via mosquito vectors, sexual contact, and blood transfusion (3) (4) (5) . The virus typically causes asymptomatic infections in adults, but can cause severe fetal sequelae when infection occurs during pregnancy. ZIKV infection of pregnant women is associated with fetal abnormalities -collectively referred to as the congenital Zika syndrome (6) -that are characterized by a spectrum of developmental defects in the human fetus, including microcephaly, decreased brain tissue and structural abnormalities, limb contractures, as well as neurological sequelae. While much of the attention has been focused on the biology of the ZIKV and its mosquito vector, the immunologic complexity of pregnancy and placental immune responses to ZIKV have been largely ignored. Currently, there is no specific treatment for ZIKV infection. Although there are more than 50 candidate ZIKV vaccines and antibodies being developed (7) (8) (9) , their use in pregnant women is still pending completion of clinical trials and FDA approval. Moreover, the preventive and therapeutic strategies are virus specific, and targeted toward the virus itself, and in some cases still do not mitigate adverse perinatal outcomes (10) . Although ZIKV infection can have direct effects on fetal tissues, there is evidence that the long-term perinatal and neurologic sequelae are associated with increased inflammation and dysregulation of the placenta (11) (12) (13) .",

            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy causes significant adverse sequelae in the developing fetus, and results in long-term structural and neurologic defects. Most preventive and therapeutic efforts have focused on the development of vaccines, antivirals, and antibodies. The placental immunologic response to ZIKV, however, has been largely overlooked as a target for therapeutic intervention. The placental inflammatory response, specifically IL-1\u03b2 secretion and signaling, is induced by ZIKV infection and represents an environmental factor that is known to increase the risk of perinatal developmental abnormalities. We show in a mouse model that maternally administrated IL-1 receptor antagonist (IRA; Kineret, or anakinra), following ZIKV exposure, can preserve placental function (by improving trophoblast invasion and placental vasculature), increase fetal viability, and reduce neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring. We further demonstrate that while ZIKV RNA is highly detectable in placentas, it is not correlated with fetal viability. Beyond its effects in the placenta, we show that IL-1 blockade may also directly decrease fetal neuroinflammation by mitigating fetal microglial activation in a dose-dependent manner. Our studies distinguish the role of placental inflammation during ZIKV-infected pregnancies, and demonstrate that maternal IRA may attenuate fetal neuroinflammation and improve perinatal outcomes. (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .Increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, from ZIKV-infected cells might contribute to cell death (19, 20) . Furthermore, IL-1\u03b2 is elevated in the serum of nonpregnant ZIKV-infected patients (7, 21) . Whether IL-1\u03b2 is upregulated in the placenta following ZIKV infection remains unknown and formed the basis of the current study.",

These observations provided the foundation for our investigation of the role of IL-1 signaling in maternal ZIKV-induced fetal brain injury and its potential as a therapeutic target to prevent or attenuate congenital Zika syndrome. We hypothesized that therapeutic agents that target inflammation, e.g., through antagonism of IL-1 signaling, could mitigate placental inflammation and long-term adverse perinatal outcomes.",

We (13) and others (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) have demonstrated that systemic inoculation of virus (i.e., intraperitoneal/subcutaneous) does not result in transplacental (i.e., vertical) transfer of ZIKV in immunocompetent mice, in part because ZIKV does not antagonize the IFN response in mice as it does in humans (26) . To circumvent this problem in mice, several models have been developed to study ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy in mice, including deletion or depletion of type I IFNs (28, (31) (32) (33) , development of humanized STAT2 mice (26) , and direct inoculation into the female reproductive tract (13, (34) (35) (36) . In the present study, immunocompetent dams were infected in utero with ZIKV to systematically evaluate the impact of ZIKV on the placental inflammatory responses and test the efficacy of maternally administered IRA in reducing placental inflammation, placental dysregulation, and the subsequent adverse neonatal outcomes. Finally, we tested the direct effects of exogenous IRA on perinatal microglial infection and proliferation in vitro. Collectively, we show that IRA treatment inhibits microglial activation in the perinatal brain both directly and indirectly through preservation of trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling in the placenta.",

Because ZIKV infection induces peripheral IL-1\u03b2 secretion in nonpregnant ZIKV-infected humans and mice (38) , we sought to determine whether ZIKV infection during pregnancy could similarly upregulate IL-1\u03b2 as well as other proinflammatory mediators in the placenta. Using multiplexed arrays, we measured the mRNA expression of 96 immune-related genes and observed that Il1\u03b2 mRNA expression, but not expression of other proinflammatory cytokines, was upregulated in the placenta 6 hours after in utero ZIKV inoculation (P < 0.05, Student's t test, Figure 2A and Supplemental Table 1 ; supplemental material available online with this article; https:// doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.122678DS1 ). At 6 hpi, the concentration of IL-1\u03b2 was also significantly increased in ZIKV-infected placentas as compared with placentas from mock-inoculated dams (P < 0.05, Student's t test, Figure 2B ). The induction of IL-1\u03b2 in placenta was transient, as these changes were less pronounced at 48 hpi (Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 1A ). Peripherally, in the maternal spleen, there was no increase in the concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 at 6 hours following intrauterine ZIKV inoculation ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that in this model, IL-1\u03b2-mediated inflammation was occurring locally in the placenta. To determine whether the ZIKV-induced increase in placental IL-1\u03b2 required replicating virus, dams were inoculated with inactivated ZIKV and placentas were collected 6 hpi. Live, but not inactivated, ZIKV caused an increase in placental IL-1\u03b2 concentrations (Supplemental Figure 1B) , illustrating that virus replication is necessary to induce IL-1\u03b2 in the placenta.",

Consistent with previous results ( Figure 1F ), fetal viability was significantly reduced in ZIKV-compared with mock-inoculated dams 48 hpi (P < 0.05, \u03c7 2 , Figure 2D ); in contrast, the viability of fetuses from IRA-treated ZIKV-infected dams significantly improved as compared with ZIKV-infected dams (P < 0.05, \u03c7 2 , Figure 2D ). The ZIKV-induced reduction in fetal viability was reversed by coadministration of IRA not only at 3 hpi, but at 1 or 24 hpi, suggesting that there is an extended window of opportunity for treatment (Supplemental Figure 1C) .",

IHC of placental trophoblasts (cytokeratin) and endothelial cells (vimentin) was utilized to assess the effect of IRA treatment on placental development. Compared with PBS-treated, ZIKV-infected dams, IRA administration during ZIKV infection significantly improved the migration of trophoblasts into the mesometrial triangle (P < 0.05, 1-way ANOVA, Figure 3 , A and B). There were abundant trophoblast cells around or at the decidual spiral arteries in placentas from mock-infected dams (Supplemental Figure 2 , white arrows) (39, 40) . ZIKV infection reduced the appearance of trophoblasts in the spiral arteries, whereas treatment of ZIKV-infected dams with IRA increased the amount of trophoblast cell invasion into the decidual spiral arteries (Supplemental Figure 2 ). The density of trophoblasts within the placental labyrinth was also markedly increased following IRA treatment of ZIKV-infected dams (P < 0.05, 1-way ANOVA, Figure 3 , A and B). Similarly, placental vascularity, as measured by the density of vimentin staining, was increased by IRA administration to ZIKV-infected dams (P < 0.05, 1-way ANOVA, Figure 3 , D and E). Taken together, these data illustrate that by reducing placental inflammation with IRA, ZIKV-induced placental dysfunction is mitigated despite the presence of ZIKV RNA ( Figure 2C ).",

The contribution of placental immune responses to ZIKV has been largely ignored. We and others (11) hypothesize that the placental inflammation during ZIKV infection may contribute significantly to adverse perinatal outcomes, and should be considered in therapeutic approaches for ZIKV and other infections that cause congenital defects during pregnancy. The maternal inflammatory response represents an environmental factor that is known to increase the risk for childhood and developmental diseases (51, 52) , such as autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, as well as cognitive and motor deficits (53) (54) (55) . Although ZIKV infection has direct effects on fetal tissues, we show that placental inflammation is also a major contributor to adverse perinatal outcomes following in utero ZIKV infection. In our murine model, intrauterine infection with live, replicating ZIKV caused an acute increase in placental concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, but not of other proinflammatory cytokines, that was associated with fetal demise. Blocking IL-1\u03b2 signaling improved trophoblast invasion and placental vascularity, fetal viability, and neurobehavioral measures in the offspring. ZIKV is not the only exposure that causes IL-1\u03b2mediated inflammation during pregnancy. Previous studies employing intrauterine LPS have established that IL-1\u03b2-mediated inflammation in the maternal compartment and placenta predicts the extent of fetal neurotoxicity and long-term adverse perinatal sequelae (56) (57) (58) (59) . Furthermore, IL-1 receptor blockade with IRA decreases activation of neuronal NOS (nNOS), cortical neuronal cell death, and perinatal brain injury, all of which occur with exposure to intrauterine inflammation (25, 60, 61) . Intraperitoneal injections of murine recombinant IL-1\u03b2 (rIL-1\u03b2) during E15-E17 of gestation result in neurologic sequelae (62), consistent with ZIKV (the present study) and LPS (56, (63) (64) (65) , illustrating that elevated IL-1\u03b2 during pregnancy is a significant mediator of adverse perinatal outcomes.",

Essential to the development of the placenta is sufficient invasion of trophoblasts. Insufficient trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling are associated with many pregnancy disorders, including preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction (66) . In the present study, maternal ZIKV infection significantly delayed the invasion of trophoblasts into the mesometrial triangle of the placenta at a critical time during placental development (i.e., E10.5). Similarly, placental vascular development was dysregulated by in utero ZIKV infection, as evidenced by a significant decrease in endothelial cell density. This disruption to the normal placental architecture may have affected the anchoring of the placenta into the uterine wall and the nutrient exchange between the dam and fetuses, which are necessary for fetal development (67, 68) .",

In addition, ZIKV infection causes acute placental inflammation, including secretion of IL-1\u03b2 (21) . Regardless of the cell type that produces IL-1\u03b2, studies have further shown that inflammatory responses, including IL-1\u03b2 secretion, are involved in placental dysregulation (i.e., the delay of trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling) (59, 71, 72) . While maternal treatment with IRA did not reduce ZIKV replication in the placenta, it significantly preserved placental function by increasing trophoblast invasion and improving vascularity, which is necessary for maternal-fetal communication. Furthermore, we found that the placental ZIKV RNA copies did not correlate with fetal survival, suggesting that the presence of ZIKV was not a significant factor in the trophoblast invasion. In contrast, data from the current study illustrate that the virus-induced and IL-1\u03b2-mediated immune response may be a major factor associated with fetal brain injury, as it allowed more virus to translocate through the inflamed placenta. Thus, ZIKV infection may damage the fetus directly or indirectly through placental dysregulation and inflammation.",

Although ZIKV is detectable in the fetal brain (20, 81) , we have shown that ZIKV is undetectable in the neonatal brain (13) . Despite a lack of replicating virus in the neonatal brain, neurologic abnormalities, including altered neurobehavioral outcomes, are observed into adolescence. In the CNS, microglia are a target for ZIKV (13, 82) and express the IL-1 receptor (83) . In vitro, IRA treatment improved the proliferation of primary microglia exposed to ZIKV infection. In vivo, at P0 (13) and P5 (the present study), microglial density was increased in the brains of offspring exposed to ZIKV in utero, which was associated with an altered behavioral phenotype. We hypothesize that the continuous activation of microglia after birth may contribute to long-term neurodevelopmental deficits in the offspring (82) . Our data support that placental inflammation, in particular IL-1\u03b2 activity, during pregnancy underlies prolonged microglia activation because maternal IRA treatment reduced microglia activation in the brains of ZIKV-exposed offspring; therefore, neurobehavioral abnormalities in pups that were observed following placental inflammation may have been caused either by replicating viruses or nonreplicating inflammatory stimuli.",

Despite having an intact immune system, a limitation with our model is that in an effort to bypass the peripheral immune responses, we inoculate mice into the uterine horn, which is not a natural route of infection but does require virus to traverse the placental barrier. Future studies must examine inflammatory immune responses during pregnancy in humans to confirm that IL-1\u03b2 is elevated and could serve as a therapeutic target for treatment during ZIKV or other congenital infections.",

The steps that need to be taken for these findings to be applied in the clinic are studies evaluating the safety of application during pregnancy, including doses, timing, and long-term effects. These translational studies will have a significant impact on perinatal medicine by enhancing the current understanding of the role of placental inflammation in the pathogenesis of fetal congenital diseases, and by testing the feasibility and implications for in utero immunomodulatory agents. In addition to ZIKV, other neurotrophic flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Powassan virus, cause adverse placental and fetal outcomes when infection occurs during pregnancy (89) . ZIKV may serve as an excellent model for many congenital infections that cause long-term perinatal injury and for which there currently is no cure.",

For intrauterine injection, the inoculum was divided equally into 4 injections delivered into the uterine myometrium, opposite the placenta, and between the gestational sacs of the first 5 fetuses closest to the cervix of one uterine horn. The contralateral uterine horn was not manipulated. Routine closure was performed after injections, and dams were returned to individual cages for recovery. Investigators were not blinded to the treatment group assignments. Mice were randomly selected to be euthanized by CO 2 exposure followed by cardiac exsanguination at either 6 or 48 hpi, or after delivery at P5, P9, or P18, depending on the experimental design. At the time of euthanasia, the total number of viable and nonviable fetuses was quantified for each pregnant dam. Fetal viability was determined as the percentage of fetuses within the inoculated uterine horn for ZIKV-and mock-infected dams that were viable. Small or discolored fetuses or the absence of a fetus at an implantation site were counted as nonviable. Maternal spleens, placentas, and fetuses were collected from each dam for determination of viral burden by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), TCID 50 assay, and IHC.
