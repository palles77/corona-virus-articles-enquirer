For example, veterinarians traditionally view biosecurity as the set of management practices to protect animals -livestock or others of economic value -against microbial threat, some of which may be inadvertently introduced by humans. Preventing influenza in pig farming and tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) among elephants in zoological parks are two illustrations [1] . \"Biosecurity\" takes on an entirely different meaning in international political agreements such as the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1975, where it refers to measures to prevent the research and development of microorganisms or their products for hostile purposes [2] . And it is not too far a reach to think of biosecurity as the prevention of infectious disease -and specifically communicable infectious disease -in humans [3] .",

Many (if not most) laboratorians are unaware of the historical origins of biosecurity. Perhaps of greater importance is that laboratory officials and researchers working with dangerous pathogens may be na\u00efve to the origins in the law of the now lengthy list of operational biosecurity requirements, obviously of practical relevance in the day-to-day functions of research facilities. The key pieces of legislation that have mandated these requirements were responses to events such as bioterrorism threats in the late 1990s and the downing of the World Trade Center buildings in 2001 as we shall see in more detail shortly.",

These rules are revised at intervals, sometimes on a regular basis and also when new laws are passed. We will summarize the processes by which agencies with HHS and USDA -typically the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) -interpret the will of Congress (via laws that have been proposed, debated and passed), formulate proposed regulations, solicit comments from individuals and entities likely to be affected, and then disseminate final rules. Beyond the legislation itself, the president may issue directives: these include executive orders or \"EO\"s, which have the full force of the law and must be published in the Federal Register (FR); and administrative orders such as memorandums, determinations, notices, which have the same legal effect but do not have a publication requirement in the FR and may therefore be \"born classified.\" All of these may prompt executive agencies (such as HHS and USDA) to craft new rules as well. Several biosecurity-relevant EOs will also be reviewed.",

Thus, over the past few decades there have also been several key reports from professional organizations, ad hoc groups and government-sponsored panels that have had a dramatic influence on biosecurity practice. Their importance goes beyond mere operational standards for laboratories. Rather, documents such as those produced at the ground-breaking Asilomar Conference in 1975 [8] through the recent publications of National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) and the Federal Experts Security Advisory Panel have set in motion an inclusive process for scientists in and outside of government to recommend revision of biosecurity requirements that reflect research priorities involving naturally occurring organisms and (regrettably) those which might be used in bioterrorism. Because of their importance to laboratorians these reports will also be summarized.",

The now famous \"Select Agent and Toxin List\" (SATL) is perhaps the most visible result of the regulatory framework that applies to many biological laboratories and we will show its development over the past decade-and-a-half in detail. In so doing, we hope to foster involvement of thoughtful scientists in formulating policy. After all, bench scientists often have far more familiarity with cutting-edge research and experience with laboratory practices than most officials in the executive branch of government tasked with enacting far-reaching legislation.",

            "text": "In the mid-nineteenth century a series of \"International Sanitary Conferences\" were held in Paris, Vienna, Constantinople, Washington, Rome and Dresden with the goal of interrupting recurring epidemics of three diseases recently arrived or reappearing in Europe and North America: cholera, plague and yellow fever (each disease entity had a clinical pedigree and its epidemiologic characteristics roughly described, though all were without known cause). Over the course of 14 meetings starting in 1851 and ending in 1938, participants from the medical and diplomatic communities debated the origins of these diseases and the preventive actions that could be taken to \"protect [people] and control\" biological agents. This was the naissance of biosecurity in its most straightforward sense, and in retrospect is surprising given that the germ theory of disease was, at that moment in history, barely being formulated and understood. Absent that theory, early on in the Sanity Conferences, physicians and diplomats representing about a dozen countries from the United States to Russia argued over the effectiveness of quarantine and the very nature of what is now recognized as infectious disease. Anthony Perrier of Great Britain declared at the first gathering that cholera was not \"communicable\" and that \"contagion is not a fact, but a hypothesis invented to explain a number of facts that without this hypothesis would be inexplicable\" [9] . Offering no better explanation himself, Perrier went on to note that his colleagues \"persisted in the routine path of practices that are outmoded, useless and ruinous to commerce and harmful to public health in that instead of enlightening the peoples on the true means of guaranteeing themselves against epidemics, they inspire on the contrary a false sense of security that prevents them from taking the only sanitary precautions that can offer real guarantees.\" Perrier did not at this juncture specify what might constitute those \"guarantees.\" This is perhaps the first association of the words \"security\" and \"public health\" in the setting of (then unknown) infectious diseases. Remarkably enough, less than 80 years after Perrier's confusing admonitions, the origin and routes of transmission for all three diseases had been identified and effective preventive practices put into routine use -\"biosecurity\" by any other name. As the Sanitary Conferences continued to meet, in December 1907 representatives decided to formalize the forum into the \"Office International d'Hygi\u00e8ne Publique\" (OIHP), ultimately subsumed into the League of Nations at the end of World War I. It became known as the League's \"Health Organization\" and produced an astonishing body of work including outbreak control and mitigation (with locales that ranged from Europe to ports in the Far East), nutrition (across the age spectrum from infants to adults), standards for medications, vitamins, antitoxins and vaccines, epidemiology of cancer (of a variety of organs) and even building construction guidelines to name but a small portion of their work [10] . The OIHP continued to operate until 1946 when the nascent World Health Organization (WHO), today's premier international health security institution, subsumed its functions [11] .",

'Laboratory biosecurity' refers to institutional and personal security measures designed to prevent the loss, theft, misuse, diversion or intentional release of pathogens and toxins\" [12] .

There are currently 26 committees in the House 4 and 24 in the Senate. 5 With rare exception, each committee has several subcommittees (as of this writing a total of 94 subcommittees in the House and about 70 in the Senate), and subcommittees often have overlapping jurisdiction, so several may hold hearings on a given bill simultaneously. Thus, only a minority (around 15%) of introduced bills are reported out of committee for vote on the floor of House and Senate, and few bills escape the committee process without substantial rewriting of the original proposed text based on the decisions of committee members after listening to witnesses at hearings, or taking into account the views of their constituents. And even after surviving this process, the senior leadership of the House and Senate each decide whether or not they will, in fact, allow a bill to come up for floor debate at all. Should a bill pass both houses in something other than identical form -as often occurs when one house makes amendments to a bill originating in the other body -a \"conference committee\" must reconcile the differences. If (as is not unusual) a dozen or more subcommittees from each house have been involved in discussing the bill, more than a hundred members may appear at the conference committee (or \"conference\" for short) meetings.",

Briefly the official publications (date and FR volume and page) bringing the terms of the law into effect were: Throughout the 2\u00bd-year period -which also included a public meeting in late 2002 -about 150 written comments were received by officials at the CDC and many more at APHIS (the agency within and designated by USDA to implement the requirements of the legislation). Although most of the suggestions submitted by commenters were rejected by the agencies, some clarifications and changes were made to the proposed rules as a result. An additional outcome was a re-organization of 42 CFR 73 to make its structure similar to analogous rules promulgated by the USDA that appeared in 9 CFR 121. 17 Thus, there are three legislative milestones that have largely defined biosecurity as practiced in laboratories in the United States: The Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 establishing the first SATL and reporting and archiving requirements for transfer of those agents (later put into effect by the CDC acting on behalf of the Secretary of HHS); the US PATRIOT Act of 2001, defining possession of a biological weapon as a crime, and also \"restricted persons\" who may not possess or transfer any biological agent -that is, not merely \"Select Agents\" that can cause disease; and PHSBRA that required a biennial review of the SATL by both the Secretary of HHS and the Secretary of Agriculture, and also mandated security requirements for access to listed agents, including background checks (a \"Security Risk Assessment\") of laboratory researchers and designated RO, performed by the FBI and ultimately approved by the Attorney General.",

Noting that local institutions were already successfully screening individuals who might work with select agents (and based on the very few applications rejected by the Department of Justice in the Security Risk Assessment Program), the Board counseled against a \"formal, national Personnel Reliability Program\" as it might have \"unintended and detrimental consequences\" for scientific research. Instead the Board suggested that individual institutions should work to enhance a \"culture of responsibility and accountability\" in combination with education on biosecurity issues within professional societies. The Board also recommended reducing the list of select agents or stratifying them further by risk, which was in fact taken up by EO 13546 in 2010.

Since the comments received by an agency can be quite extensive, they may overwhelm the ability of individuals reviewing them to do so within the 30-or 60-day comment period.

It appears clear that biosecurity rule-making has, in the recent timeframe, become very complex and may extend over several years, involving as it does a wide variety of Congressional mandates and the need to solicit comments from researchers in academia and industry working with dangerous pathogens. Whether or not the plethora of regulations will result in actually strengthening biosecurity remains to be seen. 23 Professionals in the field are not always successful in changing the initial draft of an agency's proposed rules. In this particular episode of rule-making, 30 comments were received \"from researchers, scientific organizations, laboratories and universities\" (see 77FR 61056, dated October 5, 2012, accessible at: http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-10-05/pdf/2012-24434.pdf). Most of the recommendations for changes in the proposed rule were rejected by, in this case, the Department of Agriculture, but the rationale for each rejection was specifically addressed. In other cases, recommendations from comments are more frequently incorporated into the Final Rule. advice and guidance to the CDC Director and \u2026 Director of Laboratory Safety\" [29] .

            "text": "What might the future bring?As of the time of this writing, there have been two recent events that are likely to result in yet more oversight of biosecurity practices in the United States.On June 6, 2014, CDC researchers working in the Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology (BRRAT) laboratory transferred samples of B. anthracis (Ames strain) from a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) suite to a BSL-2 lab on the belief that neither viable vegetative cells nor spores were in the samples as they had been subjected to an inactivation process before being moved. However, at least some of the samples were not sterile, potentially risking infection in CDC personnel, although subsequent investigation revealed this possibility to be \"highly unlikely\" [25] . This breech of biosafety practice was announced on July 19, 2014 [26] .Further, on July 8, 2014 the CDC reported that several vials labeled \"variola\" (variola virus is the causative agent of smallpox) had been found at a cold storage facility operated by the Food and Drug Administration on the campus of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland [27] . Subsequent testing performed at the CDC confirmed the presence of viable virus in two of six vials. 24 By international agreement, all variola virus is to be kept in secure storage at two laboratories: at the CDC in Atlanta and at the State Research Center for Virologic Research in Koltsovo, Russia, and is technically \"owned\" by the WHO, which must approve all experiments involving its use. While such news was not wholly surprising -variola had turned up in at least two European laboratories since the WHO required destruction of the virus or transfer to the official WHO repositories -it did raise the question of accountability for extraordinarily dangerous pathogens in the United States.Also, in January 2014 at the CDC's Influenza Division laboratory in Atlanta, a sample of low-pathogenic avian influenza type A (subtype H9N2) was contaminated with a highly pathogenic avian influenza type A (subtype H5N1) with \"subsequent shipment of the contaminated culture to an external high-containment laboratory.\" Although there were no apparent adverse effects, the episode clearly posed a risk to individuals in the receiving laboratory (and perhaps others who handled the material before it was shipped). Many new review procedures and oversight processes were put into place (presumably at substantial cost) at the CDC [28] .These episodes were more than an embarrassment for the NIH and CDC. Since the CDC provides the staff to carry out inspections at facilities registered to hold Select Agents and Toxins, most researchers would probably assert that the CDC has a special responsibility to uphold all biosafety and biosecurity regulations. The head of the BRRAT resigned. Perhaps even worse, the United States was in violation of a critical international agreement intended to prevent the reintroduction of variola into the human population.At the end of July, CDC Director Frieden announced the formation of an external advisory group comprised of leading researchers and biosecurity experts to \"provide",
