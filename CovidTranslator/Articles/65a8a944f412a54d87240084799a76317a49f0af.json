In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that interactions that occur between distantly positioned RNA sequences within these genomes can mediate important viral activities. These long-range intragenomic RNA-RNA interactions involve direct nucleotide base pairing and can span distances of thousands of nucleotides. In this Review, we discuss recent insights into the structure and function of these intriguing genomic features and highlight their diverse roles in the gene expression and genome replication of positive-strand RNA viruses.",

Such long-range interactions were first reported for positive-strand RNA bacteriophages in the 1990s 8- 11 and, since then, have been discovered in various positive-strand RNA viruses that infect eukaryotes [4] [5] [6] [7] . All of the long-range interactions that have been characterized so far involve Watson-Crick RNA base pairing, and they often include sequences that are positioned in loop regions or in internal bulges within RNA structures. In this Review, we focus on the burgeoning field of interactions that span large distances, that is, \u22651,000 nucleotides, and we discuss how these interactions modulate viral processes. In particular, we focus on: the regulation of translation initiation by 3\u0374 cap-independent translational enhancers (3\u0374 CITEs) and internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs); translational recoding events, including ribosomal frameshifting and stop codon readthrough; genome replication; and sgm-RNA transcription. We then consider the possible roles and regulatory mechanisms of such interactions and discuss how they function in the complex context of viral RNA genomes. Last, we discuss outstanding questions that will determine the future directions of research into long-range intragenomic RNA-RNA interactions.",

These positive-strand RNA genomes lack both 5\u0374 caps and 3\u0374 poly(A) tails and instead rely on 3\u0374 CITEs for protein translation. Several different structural classes of 3\u0374 CITE have been uncovered, including a 68 nucleotide RNA stem-loop 15 and more complex multihelix pseudoknot 16, 17 or tRNA-shaped structures 18, 19 . Most 3\u0374 CITEs function by binding to the ribosome-recruiting eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex via one or both of its eIF4G and eIF4E subunits 15, 16, [20] [21] [22] , whereas others bind directly to ribosomal subunits 23, 24 . Thus, 3\u0374 CITEs can recruit ribosomes by either direct or indirect means. Despite their structural and functional diversity, 3\u0374 CITEs share a common relative position near to, or within, the 3\u0374 UTRs of viral genomes. Paradoxically, this 3\u0374-proximal position places them, and the recruited translational machinery, at the opposite end to the site of translation initiation. Consequently, many of these viruses use long-range RNA-based interactions to relocate 3\u0374 CITEs that are bound to the translational machinery to positions that are close to their cognate 5\u0374 UTRs.",

The importance of this interaction for viral translation was confirmed by compensatory mutational analysis, whereby disruption, and then restoration, of base-pairing potential by substitutions correlated with low and high levels of translational activity, respectively 25 . Similar functional base-pairing interactions between 5\u0374 UTRs and 3\u0374 CITEs have also been shown for different members of the genus Tombusvirus, including maize necrotic streak virus (MNeSV), carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) and tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) 15, 22, [26] [27] [28] , as well as for saguaro cactus virus of the genus Carmovirus 29 . These findings have led to a general model for 3\u0374 CITE activity, in which simultaneous binding of the 3\u0374 CITE to both the eIF4F complex and the 5\u0374 UTR enables the eIF4F-mediated recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the 5\u0374 end 15, 16, 21, 25, 27, 30 (FIG. 2a) . In vitro studies with the MNeSV 3\u0374 CITE have confirmed the formation of the proposed tripartite 5\u0374 UTR\u22123\u0374 CITE-eIF4F complex and its requirement for efficient ribosome recruitment to the 5\u0374-proximal start codon 15 .",

Accordingly, both direct and indirect modes of ribosome recruitment probably occur in PEMV. However, unlike the PTEs that have been identified in other viruses 29 , the PTE in PEMV does not interact with the 5\u0374 end of the viral genome 16 . Instead, the adjacent kl-TSS engages in a long-distance interaction with a 5\u0374-proximal hairpin, thereby uniting the terminal regions 31 (FIG. 2b) . The specific contribution of each of the 3\u0374 CITEs to the PEMV translational process remains to be fully determined; however, it is clear that the kl-TSS-mediated long-range interaction could be beneficial to the activity of both of the 3\u0374 CITEs by repositioning them close to the site of translation initiation.",

In vitro, this 3\u0374 UTR participates in two long-range interactions with the 5\u0374 UTR -one with the IRES and the other with a 5\u0374-terminal S-region that is involved in genome replication 33 (FIG. 2c) . Although the specific sequences involved were not identified, the interaction of the 3\u0374 UTR with the IRES was found to be independent of its interaction with the S-region, and the two interactions could not form simultaneously. Therefore, the detected contacts could potentially modulate both translation and genome replication. Negative regulators of viral IRES activity have also been identified. The genome of the pestivirus classical swine fever virus (CSFV) lacks both a 5\u0374 cap and a 3\u0374 poly(A) tail, and the 3\u0374 UTR inhibits the translational activity of the IRES in the 5\u0374 UTR 34 . The negative regulatory sequence that affected IRES activity was mapped to a 3\u0374-terminal RNA hairpin that ends with CGGCCC-OH.

IRES activity is downregulated by a long-range RNA-RNA interaction [35] [36] [37] that occurs between the apical loop of helix IIId in the IRES and a bulge in an essential 3\u0374-proximal cis-acting replication element in the coding region of the non-structural protein 5B (NS5B), which is known as 5BSL3.2 (REF. 35 ) (FIG. 2e) . Interestingly, the same 5BSL3.2 bulge sequence also mediates genome replication by interacting with a nearby upstream sequence located around nucleotide 9110 (FIG. 2e) . Since the two interactions are equally probable in a thermodynamic context 41 , shifting of the conformational equilibrium between the two interactions could regulate viral translation and genome replication 39, 41, 42 . In addition, there is both genetic and structural evidence that the terminal loop of 5BSL3.2 base pairs with the 3\u0374 SL2 element, which is an RNA element that is located in the 3\u0374 UTR and is involved in genome replication [39] [40] [41] 43 (FIG. 2e) .

In addition, in the plant viruses BYDV and red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV; genus Dianthovirus), the efficient -1 frameshifting that produces their viral RdRps requires base pairing between their proximal stimulatory RNA structures and complementary sequences that are located ~4,000 and ~2,500 nucleotides downstream, respectively 47, 48 .

This process is catalysed by a virally encoded RdRp and is assisted by viral and host proteins. The initiation of negative-strand synthesis involves the RdRp accessing the 3\u0374 terminus of a genome, and RNA sequences and structures that facilitate this are usually located near to the 3\u0374 end. However, there is compelling evidence that RNA elements that are considerably distal to 3\u0374 ends can also influence the efficiency of complementary strand production 51, 52 . shows coding regions as cylinders. p39 and p60 correspond to proteins of 39 kDa and 60 kDa, respectively, which are encoded in two separate ORFs in different reading frames. p39 is produced when no ribosome frameshifting occurs. However, when a -1 frameshift occurs near the very 3\u0374 end of the p39 ORF, ribosomes are shifted into the p60 reading frame and translate the p60 ORF as a carboxy-terminal extension of p39. The resulting frameshift protein is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is approximately 99 kDa. Frameshifting is stimulated by a long-range interaction (double-headed arrow) between a bulge in an RNA structure that is near to the frameshift site and the terminal loop of a 3\u0374-proximal stem-loop. Interacting sequences are shown in green. b | Linear representation of the carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) RNA genome, which shows readthrough translation of its RdRp. Ribosomes that initiate at the 5\u0374 end of the genome normally terminate at the stop codon at the end of the p36 ORF, producing a protein of 36 kDa. Translational readthrough of the p36 stop codon produces a C-terminally extended readthrough protein of 95 kDa (p95), which is the viral RdRp. Readthrough requires base pairing between the proximal readthrough element (PRTE) that is located near to the stop codon and the 3\u0374-proximal distal readthrough element (DRTE). The DRTE 3\u0374 sequence is associated with one of two mutually exclusive RNA conformations. The SL-T conformation facilitates readthrough and prevents genome replication, whereas the alternative conformation, which contains SL-2, promotes replication and inhibits readthrough. These two conformations thus represent a type of RNA switch that probably coordinates translation and replication.",

An alternative mechanism for the production of sgmRNAs involves the premature termination of the viral RdRp during negative-strand synthesis of the genome. This results in the generation of a 3\u0374-truncated negative-strand that is then used as a template for the synthesis of positive-strand sgmRNA s 1,80 (FIG. 5b) . Premature termination is facilitated by an RNA attenuation signal in the positive-strand genome, which is formed by a base-paired RNA segment that is located just upstream of the sgmRNA start site. This signal functions as a physical 'roadblock' that induces polymerase termination. Notably, the attenuation signals that promote the transcription of sgmRNA1 and sgmRNA2 in TBSV are formed by long-range interactions that involve activator and receptor sequences, which are known as AS1-RS1 and AS2-RS2, respectively 80,81 (FIG. 5b) .

A sequence that is located in the central region of its larger genome segment interacts with two different downstream sequences, one of which is located more than 1.4 kb away and is positioned directly in front of the sgmRNA transcription start site 85 . The double-stranded RNA structure that forms ahead of the initiation site is probably functionally comparable to the attenuation signals in TBSV. It has also been proposed that another bisegmented virus -the dianthovirus RCNMV -uses a premature termination mechanism for transcription 86 . However, for RCNMV, the attenuation signal forms in trans between two complementary sequences that are located separately in the RNA1 and RNA2 genome segments. During infections, the increase in the concentrations of the two genome segments promotes the formation of this bimolecular interaction, which, in turn, activates sgmRNA transcription. Accordingly, it was proposed that this interaction provides a concentration-dependent mechanism to temporally synchronize the transcription of the capsid protein-encoding sgmRNA with the accumulation of the two genomic segments that are co-packaged 86 .",

These include the relocalization of bound proteins to a distal genomic location (for example, repositioning 3\u0374 CITE-bound factors near to 5\u0374 termini or repositioning 5\u0374-proximally bound RdRps near to 3\u0374 termini), the generation of a bipartite RNA platform for the assembly of protein complexes (for example, the RII-RIV RNA platform that is used for tombusvirus replicase complex assembly), the colocalization of two RNA elements that require proximity for function (for example, TRS elements involved in RdRp repriming in coronavirus transcription) and the formation of RNA structures that directly regulate a viral process (for example, the double-stranded attenuation signals that direct the premature termination of RdRps during sgmRNA transcription). In some cases, the need for a long-range interaction is clear, such as in relocating proteins; however, in other cases, the requirement is less obvious. For example, the attenuation signals that are involved in sgmRNA transcription in tombusviruses can be functionally replaced by local RNA hairpins, which indicates that the long-distance interactions are not essential 83 . Interestingly, some viruses that are related to tombusviruses (for example, carmoviruses and necroviruses) use local, rather than long-range, transcription-attenuation signals [87] [88] [89] . Thus, the differences that are observed could simply reflect the random nature of the emergence of local versus long-range interactions during virus evolution. Nevertheless, long-range interactions may provide yet-to-be discovered regulatory advantages that could be mediated via genome-level RNA rearrangement.",

            "text": "Long-distance base-pairing interactions can be regulated by several mechanisms. The most basic strategy is to modulate the stability of the base-paired region by altering the composition and/or number of nucleotides that are involved. The presence of competing RNA structures provides an additional mechanism, which is exemplified by the RNA switches that regulate the interactions that are required for translation and/or replication in HCV 40 , replication in DENV 68 and readthrough in CIRV 50 (as described in the previous sections). Furthermore, long-range interactions might also be regulated by proteins that could facilitate or prevent the formation of an interaction and/ o r destabilize or stabilize an interaction. In line with such concepts, the flavivirus core protein and NS3 helicase have been shown to facilitate circularization in vitro 63, 64 , and it seems probable that proteins also modulate some of the interactions in other systems. Interactions can also be mediated by several different contacts, as has been reported for flavivirus circularization [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] , and this suggests that cooperative effects and different regulatory mechanisms for individual contacts could also have a role 60 .",

Alternatively, if some of the proposed cis-interactions do actually occur in trans, as has been suggested 70 , then genome abundance would clearly be an additional mode of control (as has been proposed for sgmRNA transcription in RCNMV 86 and for frameshifting in SARS-CoV 49 ).

Accordingly, proper coordination of these interactions must be essential for their function. This regulation would be particularly relevant for viruses that have multiple long-range interactions,",

The TBSV genome structure also revealed the presence of differently sized domains (small domain (sD), blue; medium domain (mD), orange; and large domain (lD), green), and the large domains (which are 500-2,000 nucleotides long) correspond to different coding regions.

Thus, genomes must be dynamic and able to adopt alternative conformations, which would be influenced by the intrinsic features of the RNA and its environmental context. Indeed, the structure of the viral genome is likely to be distinct during different steps of the viral life cycle -for example, when the genome is encapsidated, has just been released from its capsid, is being translated, is being replicated or transcribed or is undergoing packaging. Other events, such as co-replicativ e 5\u0374-to-3\u0374 folding of the genome during its synthesis, would also influence initial and ultimate structures and the ability to form different long-range interactions 10 .

These studies are now possible, owing to technical advances, such as high-throughput SHAPE structural mapping (selective 2\u0374-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension structural mapping) 91, 92 . This chemical probing method provides information about nucleotide flexibility at each position in an RNA, which positively correlates with the likelihood that a residue is single-stranded in the structure. The SHAPE reactivity data can be incorporated into a thermodynamic-based RNA secondary structurepredicting program as a pseudo-free energy parameter to improve model prediction 91, 92 .

            "text": "These viruses have evolved to integrate long-range interactions within their genomes in a manner that provides them with mechanisms to regulate a diverse array of viral functions. Indeed, it is quite remarkable that these relatively simple interactive structural features are able to carry out such a broad range of structure-based functions. Importantly, these interactions provide the viruses with a unique opportunity for regulation that is linked to genome structure; this, in turn, may provide benefits in addition to those of local RNA elements. Many important advances have been made in understanding the structure and function of long-range interactions. Unfortunately, not all interactions are amenable to the available investigative methodologies. For example, interactions that are transient or that require special conditions in order to form may be difficult to detect biochemically and interactions that have unknown, functionally relevant, alternative base-pair partners may be intractable to genetic techniques, such as compensatory mutational analyses. Regardless of the challenges, the interactions that are supported by both biophysical and genetic evidence should be viewed as having increased credibility. For the future, additional research and technological advances are needed to expand on existing findings and to clarify open questions; for example, it will be crucial to determine the detailed structures of different interactions and to establish how these structures influence activity. Other important challenges will be to identify the dynamics and energetic barriers of transitions and folding pathways. In addition, future research is needed to determine the regulatory advantage of long-range interactions, how these interactions are integrated and coordinated within viral genomes and whether any of these interactions occur in trans. Moreover, it will be crucial to investigate the possible involvement of viral and/or host proteins in regulating interactions and how the cellular environment affects interactions. An increased understanding of longrange interactions will also help to determine whether such interactions are plausible targets for antiviral therapies. Finally, another area for future consideration extends beyond viral contexts to cellular messages: how common are functional long-range RNA-RNA interactions in cellular mRNA biogenesis and function? A limited number of recent reports suggest that these structures can indeed participate in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing 96 as well as in the control of eukaryotic 97 and bacterial 98 mRNA translation. Consequently, the phenomenon that is observed in viruses may foreshadow a similar prevalence and diversity of functional long-range RNA-RNA interactions in cellular mRNAs. ",
