            "text": "Motivation: An important aspect of infectious disease research involves understanding the differences and commonalities in the infection mechanisms underlying various diseases. Systems biology-based approaches study infectious diseases by analyzing the interactions between the host species and the pathogen organisms. This work aims to combine the knowledge from experimental studies of hostpathogen interactions in several diseases to build stronger predictive models. Our approach is based on a formalism from machine learning called 'multitask learning', which considers the problem of building models across tasks that are related to each other. A 'task' in our scenario is the set of host-pathogen protein interactions involved in one disease. To integrate interactions from several tasks (i.e. diseases), our method exploits the similarity in the infection process across the diseases. In particular, we use the biological hypothesis that similar pathogens target the same critical biological processes in the host, in defining a common structure across the tasks. Results: Our current work on host-pathogen protein interaction prediction focuses on human as the host, and four bacterial species as pathogens. The multitask learning technique we develop uses a taskbased regularization approach. We find that the resulting optimization problem is a difference of convex (DC) functions. To optimize, we implement a Convex-Concave procedure-based algorithm. We compare our integrative approach to baseline methods that build models on a single host-pathogen protein interaction dataset. Our results show that our approach outperforms the baselines on the training data. We further analyze the protein interaction predictions generated by the models, and find some interesting insights.",

Newly emerging viral diseases, such as swine H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bacterial infections, such as the recurrent Salmonella and Escherichia coli outbreaks not only lead to wide-spread loss of life and health, but also result in heavy economic losses. To better navigate this landscape of infectious diseases, it is important to not only understand the mechanisms of individual diseases, but also the commonalities between them. Combining knowledge from related diseases will give us deeper insights into infection and host immune response, will enhance our ability to comprehend new diseases and lead to efficient development of therapeutics.",

Databases like PHI-base (Winnenburg et al., 2008) , PIG (Driscoll et al., 2009) , HPIDB (Kumar and Nanduri, 2010) , PHISTO (Tekir et al., 2012) aggregate host-pathogen protein interactions from several small-scale and high-throughput experiments via manual literature curation.

(2010) show how various bacterial cyclomodulins target the host cell cycle. The study by Mukhtar et al. (2011) on plant pathogens, in particular, Arabidopsis concludes that pathogens from different kingdoms deploy independently evolved virulence proteins that interact with a limited set of highly connected cellular hubs to facilitate their diverse life cycle strategies. Figure 1B illustrates an example depicting the commonality in various bacterial species, where they are targeting the same biological pathways in their human host.",

Another line of work in PPI prediction (Xu et al., 2010) uses the Collective Matrix Factorization (CMF) approach proposed by Singh and Gordon (2008) . The CMF method learns models for multiple networks by simultaneously factorizing several adjacency matrices and sharing parameters amongst the factors. Xu et al. (2010) use these ideas in their transfer learning setting, where the source network is a relatively dense interaction network of proteins and the objective is to infer PPI edges in a relatively sparse target network.

The goal is to achieve performance benefits for all the tasks involved. This paradigm of building joint models has been applied successfully in many areas including text mining, computer vision, etc. Because bioinformatics datasets often represent an organism, a natural notion of a 'task' is an 'organism'-for example, the work by Widmer et al. (2010) uses a multitask learning approach for splice-site prediction across many organisms. They use phylogenetic trees to incorporate similarity between organisms (i.e. tasks).

A natural way to determine similarity is to check if proteins known to interact in one dataset have homologous proteins that are also interacting in another dataset. Such pairs of proteins, also called 'interologs', are defined as a quadruple of proteins A, B, A 0 , B 0 , where A $ B (interaction) and A 0 $ B 0 . Further, A, A 0 are homologs and B, B 0 are also homologs. The number of such interologs existing between the four datasets is shown in Table 2 . To compute homologs of a protein, we used BLASTP sequence alignment with an e-value cutoff of 0.1. As evident from Table 2 , there are few interologs across the bacterial PPIs. None of the high-throughput datasets have an interolog in the small-scale S.typhi dataset. This seems to indicate that interolog-based approaches to compute task similarity are not relevant here. The phenomenon governing the similarity of these host-pathogen interactions is probably at a much higher level, rather than at the level of individual proteins. We explore one such possibility-the 'commonality hypothesis'.",

The overall performance of all methods on this dataset is twice as good as that on the others. We believe that the difference in the nature of the datasets might explain the above observations. While the S.typhi dataset comprises small-scale interaction studies, the other datasets come from high-throughput experiments. Owing to its smaller size, it has less variance making it an easier task. This dataset is also likely to be a biased sample of interactions, as it comes from focussed studies targeting select proteins. The coupled learner (Coupled) performs slightly worse than Indep. This is explained by the fact that Indep. has more flexibility in setting the regularization parameter for each task separately, which is not the case in Coupled. It is interesting to note that the independent models that use the pathway matrices P s and P t as features (i.e. Indep-Path) show a slightly worse performance than the Indep. models that do not use them. This seems to suggest that the cross-task pathway similarity structure that we enforce using our regularizer has more information than simply the pathway membership of proteins used as features.

Each bootstrap sampling experiment consists of the following procedure: we first make two random splits of 80 and 20% of the data, such that the class ratio of 1:100 is maintained in both. The training set is then constructed using a bootstrap sample from the 80% split and the test data from the 20% split. A total of 50 models are thus trained and evaluated.

The sizes of the various intersections are shown in Figure 5 . Seventeen pathways are commonly enriched across all four tasks. One hundred four pathways are enriched across the three high-throughput datasets, which is a significant fraction of the total number of pathways considered. This result indicates that the bias produced by our regularizer does produce predictions satisfying the commonality hypothesis. Table 6 shows some of the common enriched pathways. The 'Integrin alpha IIb beta3 (IIb 3) signaling' pathway is enriched only in B.anthracis and Y.pestis in the training data. However, in the predictions it is enriched in all four bacterial datasets.
