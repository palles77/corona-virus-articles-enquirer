            "text": "Ring vaccination can be a highly effective control strategy for an emerging disease or in the final phase of disease eradication, as witnessed in the eradication of smallpox. However, the impact of behavioural dynamics on the effectiveness of ring vaccination has not been explored in mathematical models. Here, we analyze a series of stochastic models of voluntary ring vaccination. Contacts of an index case base vaccinating decisions on their own individual payoffs to vaccinate or not vaccinate, and they can also imitate the behaviour of other contacts of the index case. We find that including imitation changes the probability of containment through ring vaccination considerably. Imitation can cause a strong majority of contacts to choose vaccination in some cases, or to choose non-vaccination in other cases-even when the equivalent solution under perfectly rational (non-imitative) behaviour yields mixed choices. Moreover, imitation processes can result in very different outcomes in different stochastic realizations sampled from the same parameter distributions, by magnifying moderate tendencies toward one behaviour or the other: in some realizations, imitation causes a strong majority of contacts not to vaccinate, while in others, imitation promotes vaccination and reduces the number of secondary infections. Hence, the effectiveness of ring vaccination can depend significantly and unpredictably on imitation processes. Therefore, our results suggest that risk communication efforts should be initiated early in an outbreak when ring vaccination is to be applied, especially among subpopulations that are heavily influenced by peer opinions.",

Ring vaccination involves identifying infectious index cases and vaccinating their close contacts to prevent them from being infected (Greenhalgh 1986; Muller et al. 2000) . Ring vaccination tends to be more efficient and more effective than UMV for preventing outbreaks when (1) outbreaks are localized, (2) infected individuals and their exposed contacts can be rapidly identified, and (3) the vaccine induces an immune response rapidly enough for contacts to be protected before they can become infected.",

Ring vaccination was credited as the strategy that culminated the eradication of smallpox (Hopkins 1988) . One of the earliest applications of ring vaccination was in Nigeria, when a smallpox outbreak developed among a religious sect. Faced with limited resources and vaccine supplies, staff learned to isolate infected individuals and identify and vaccinate their contacts, leading to successful containment of the outbreak (Hopkins 1988; Strassburg 1982) . In the case of smallpox, the vaccine can prevent both infection and disease in persons who have already been infected, meaning that ring vaccination could be particularly effective despite delays in identifying index cases. For pandemics of novel emerging pathogens, ring vaccination may likewise be an optimal strategy if there are not sufficient vaccine supplies to mount mass vaccination campaigns.",

            "text": "Because ring vaccination involves reaching a relatively small number of individuals, the success or failure of ring vaccination can depend strongly on stochastic effects. The debate about whether to include stochastic effects in infection transmission models is long-running (Lloyd- Smith et al. 2005) . Often the average of many realizations of a stochastic model is identical to what would be predicted from a deterministic model, in which case the primary advantage of the stochastic model is to provide an estimate of variability. However, in other situations the average of many stochastic realizations may differ from the prediction of the equivalent deterministic model or there may be other important qualitative differences. For instance, if the number of secondary infections per index case is modelled as a negative binomial distribution, a stochastic modelling approach can predict more frequent extinctions, and rarer but more severe outbreaks, than a deterministic modelling approach (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Similarly, network models have been used to demonstrate that a wide range of outbreak sizes and outbreak probabilities caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are possible even for the same R 0 , highlighting the role of underlying contact networks (Meyers et al. 2005) .",

Conversely, there have been a number of mathematical models of ring vaccination that do not explicitly incorporate behaviour considerations (Greenhalgh 1986; Muller et al. 2000; Kretzschmar et al. 2004; Kaplan 2004) . However, relatively little work has focussed on behavioural effects and ring vaccination per se Bauch 2009a, 2009b) . Some of these previous models have assumed that individuals adopt new strategies through an imitation process, where individuals base their vaccinating decisions partly on the experiences or opinions of other individuals in the population. Empirical studies confirm the common knowledge that the opinion of the healthcare provider is important determinant of vaccine uptake (Smith et al. 2006) . However, empirical studies also find that peer opinion has a very large influence on individual vaccinating decisions (Merrill et al. 1958; Streefland et al. 1999; Sturm et al. 2005; Rao et al. 2007) . For example, Merrill et al. (1958) found that vaccinating decisions of mothers in California were influenced by their peer groups. Sturm et al. (2005) review Merrill et al. (1958) and other more recent publications documenting the strong roles of peer group opinion and social norms in vaccinating decisions. An empirical study analyzing perceptions of vaccination on real-world social networks likewise found that peer opinion is an important determinant of perceive value of vaccination and vaccinating behaviour, to the point that \"students coordinate their vaccinating decisions with their friends\" (Rao et al. 2007 ). Hence, imitation processes appear to be an important mechanism in individual vaccination decisions.",

We incorporate stochasticity since stochastic effects can be important determinants the success or failure of ring vaccination. The vaccinating choices of the index case's contacts therefore determine whether or not ring vaccination will be successful. The particular question of interest is whether models that include stochastic effects and imitation processes have qualitatively different predictions from a model that is deterministic, and/or does not include imitation processes.",

In the \"distributed stochastic model\", this stochastic model is further extended by drawing parameters for vaccine and disease risks for each individual from probability distributions, meaning that contacts of the index case can have different payoff functions, leading to different decisions. Finally, for \"the distributed stochastic model with imitation\", the distributed stochastic model is extended by including an imitation process between contacts of the index case.

For instance, for low infection risk, none of the contacts of the index case vaccinate since P V < P N , and thus the average value of R is 2.3. However, for the cost of infection r inf > 0.25, P V > P N , all of the contacts vaccinate and the mean value of R becomes approximately 1 (Fig. 2a) .

The mean value of R is constant on either side of these thresholds for the plots of mean R versus r inf and r vac because these parameters influence vaccinating behaviour but not the probability that a susceptible or vaccinated person becomes infected.

The resulting mean value of R is plotted against the mean parameter values for r inf , r vac , \u03b5, and \u03c9 from the lognormal distribution (Fig. 2) . The model predictions are qualitatively different from the simple stochastic model. Primarily, the thresholds in r vac , r inf , and \u03b5 appear to be \"smeared out\" relative to the simple stochastic model, because heterogeneity in the sampled parameter values means that the payoff functions for individuals are also variable. Therefore, in general there is no parameter value for which either P V > P N or P V < P N is true for all individuals. In general, for any given mean parameter value, P V > P N will hold for some individuals and P V < P N will hold for others. However, as the mean parameter values change, so does the mean behaviour: the mean value of R increases for increasing r vac and \u03c9, because vaccination becomes less favourable as the perceived vaccine risk and the incubation period increase (Fig. 2b, d) . In contrast, the mean value of R decreases for increasing r inf and \u03b5, because vaccination becomes more favourable as the disease risk and vaccine efficacy increase.",

This effect is not surprising because a higher transmission rate implies a greater number of secondary transmissions, even when vaccination is taken up and provides some reduction in secondary cases. However, what is more interesting is that the relative magnitude of the two peaks in the distribution of number vaccinated changes as p is increased: when p = 0.05 most individuals do not vaccinate, whereas when p = 0.2, most of them do (i.e., the relative size of the two peaks in the distribution of vaccinators is switched in the case for p = 0.05 compared to p = 0.2). An increase in p increases the probability of eventually becoming infected and thus experiencing disease penalties, hence vaccination becomes attractive for higher p, at least at these parameter values. This switch is again observed in the distribution of the number of secondary infections: when p = 0.05, the peak corresponding to more secondary infections (i.e., less vaccination) is larger, indicating that in most realizations, the majority of contacts do not vaccinate and the number of secondary infections increases.

The introduction of semi-connectedness can change the results significantly for certain values of connectedness. For the special case of no connectedness (n = 0), the case of the distribution stochastic model without imitation is recovered and distributions are unimodal (results not shown). For n = 3, there was likewise little impact and the distributions remained unimodal (results not shown). For cases of intermediate connectedness (n = 12 and n = 25), the results change significantly (Fig. 6) . The distribution of the number of vaccinators is no longer bimodal but becomes a highly skewed unimodal distribution with a high variance. The variance increases as the strength of imitation \u03ba increases. This spreading effect occurs because in the semi-connected case, individuals are sampling a small proportion of the total number of contacts of the index case and, therefore, the average attractiveness of vaccinating versus not vaccinating is more highly variable than in the fully connected case, giving rise to greater variation in the level of vaccine adherence overall. Although the bimodality disappears, the greater variance still supports the conclusion that adding imitation can increase the variability in the predicted vaccine adherence, relative to the case of the distribution stochastic model without imitation.

In contrast, decreasing r vac below the baseline value creates a unimodal distribution representing dominant vaccinating behaviour. However, for the transmission probability p, the distribution remains bimodal across a broad range of parameter values before collapsing to a unimodal distribution. This is because p appears in both the payoff to vaccinate and the payoff not to vaccinate ((5) and (6)).

In the distributed stochastic model, we also developed an extension where the parameter values constituting the payoff functions were sampled from a lognormal distribution for each individual, resulting in heterogeneous payoff functions.

As a result, there are threshold parameter values at which all contacts of the index case switch from vaccinator to non-vaccinator or vice versa. The effect of sampling parameter values from lognormal distributions for each individual (i.e., the distributed stochastic model) is to moderate this effect and remove the thresholds, since each individual can have a different payoff. Consequently, mixed outcomes are possible where some contacts vaccinate and some do not. Adding imitation to the model has little effect on the mean and variability of the number of secondary infections at the parameter values tested. However, even when the mean and variability do not change very much, the distribution of the number of secondary infections and number of vaccinators can become bimodal at certain parameter values when imitation is strong (for the assumption of fully connected contacts of the index case). This occurs because individuals adopt whichever strategy appears to be favourable to the majority. For some stochastic realizations the apparently favourable strategy is vaccinating, whereas for others it is not vaccinating. The consequence is that ring vaccination can be highly successful under some realizations (when imitation causes most contacts to vaccinate), but can completely fail under other realizations of the same parameter values (when imitation causes most contacts not to vaccinate), resulting in failure to contain the outbreak. This occurs despite the average outcome being the same as for the model without imitation. If the contacts are semi-connected instead of fully connected, the distribution of the number of vaccinators is no longer bimodal but it remains very broad, with many possible outcomes for the same mean parameter values.",

Similarly, it has been shown how opinion formation in social networks can lead to pockets of susceptibility, ensuring the persistence of infection despite high vaccine coverage even when homogeneous mixing models predict that the infection should already be eliminated (Salathe and Bonhoeffer 2008) . Here, we have shown how imitation behaviours can exacerbate such differences in situations where ring vaccination is employed, by making the contacts of an index tend to behave in similar ways. As a result, there is a parameter regime where, for approximately the same input parameter values, vaccinating is a dominant strategy in some realizations and non-vaccinating is a dominant strategy in others. Even for parameter regimes where either vaccinating or non-vaccinating is always favoured, imitation has the role of ensuring greater homogeneity in vaccination decisions than would occur under purely rational behaviour.",

Here, we opted for a simpler approach that did not model the full network but rather just the contacts of the index case. This model has the advantage of being much easier to analyze than network models; it has the disadvantage of not capturing the full network-this is relevant to imitation processes in ring vaccination since contacts of the index case may imitate individuals who are not contacts of the index case. One rationale for only modelling the contacts of the immediate case is that if ring vaccination fails for the contacts of a single index case, it will likely fail in more complex situations where the infection has already started to spread through the social contact network. However, this may not be the case in clustered networks where the possibility of containment is determined not only by edge-wise transmissibility but also by the structure of the emerging cluster of infections (Keeling 1999; Bauch 2005) . Thus, an important limitation of our model is that it does not describe the links between contacts of the index case. We also did not capture changes in the contact structure in response to the appearance of symptoms in the index case (Zanette and Gusman 2008) or other interventions such as antiviral drugs.",

Typically, these models have considered interventions such as vaccination, contact precautions, and antiviral drugs and have implicitly assumed that the uptake of these interventions can be set at any level desired. Our model shows that the success of containment through ring vaccination can be highly variable in cases where the uptake cannot be guaranteed by the public health authorities, such as when the contacts of the index case are free to choose whether or not to vaccinate and in cases where contacts also tend to be influenced by the vaccination decisions of other contacts. Under some circumstances, these imitation processes can lead to a failure of ring vaccination. Therefore, early action to counter the possible emergence of vaccine exemption in epidemiologically important peer groups during an outbreak may be warranted. Our findings suggests that risk communication should also be thought of as an important public health intervention during a disease outbreak and that it should be likewise be applied in a timely fashion at the start of an outbreak.",
