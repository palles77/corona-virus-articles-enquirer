Most of these studies are interested in describing gene diversity, but a potential application within virome studies is to determine which human viral pathogens are most prevalent in a given environmental matrix. The major limitation to method extension toward human viral identifications is that post-sequencing bioinformatics protocols for analyzing viromes are in nascent stages of development and require careful consideration to produce the high quality virome annotations required for pathogen identification. Viruses do not contain ubiquitous genetic elements such as the 16s rRNA encoding genes (Rohwer and Edwards 2002) , hence, virome studies must sort and assemble sequences that could come from any location on the viral genome. Unresolved virome construction and annotation concerns include uncertainty about the optimal sequence read length for identification, as well as appropriate use of databases and database search programs. An additional limitation is the unknown sequencing depth required to reach the rare human viruses amidst the ubiquity of bacteriophages in the environment .",

To improve sequence analysis methods, we conducted an in silico study of 10 known human viral pathogen genomes with the aim of decreasing errors in annotating next generation sequencing reads as pathogenic viral nucleic acids. As a demonstration, viral DNA and RNA (cDNA) extracted from sewage sludge residuals resulting from municipal wastewater treatment (termed biosolids) were sequenced using 454 Life Sciences pyrosequencing technology. We then applied the optimal annotation schemes identified by the in silico study to describe the diversity and abundance of viral pathogens, and to determine the sequencing depth required to portray this viral pathogen diversity. Biosolids are ideal for demonstrating virome pathogen recovery as this waste stream originates from the solids residuals of wastewater treatment plants serving up to one million people, their pathogen content is not well documented (Gerba et al. 2002; Viau and Peccia 2009) , and growing public opposition to the land application of biosolids as a soil conditioning product has initiated an expressed desire for comprehensive viral pathogen surveys in biosolids (NRC 2002) .",

This E-value threshold was based on precedent set in prior virome studies (Zhang et al. 2005; Lopez-Bueno et al. 2009; Rosario et al. 2009 ), and also from an evaluation of annotating 100 nt adenovirus sequence segments using an E-value of either 10 \u22123 or 10 \u22125 .

First, smaller, more focused viral databases resulted in less incorrect classifications than the larger databases (Figure 1 ). Viral databases resulted in less total error in 87 of 90 search scenarios conducted. Secondly, the amino acid-based search program, BLASTx, produced a greater amount of total errors than the nucleotide-based search programs, BLASTn and tBLASTx, when comparing both the complete and virus only databases. For example, when using 200 nt artificial reads and the virus database, BLASTx percent errors averaged 355 times greater than BLASTn errors and 35 times greater than tBLASTx errors. Results from BLASTn and tBLASTx were statistically indistinguishable for total errors using the viral databases at read lengths of 200 nt (P= 0.367). Third, increasing read length either maintained or reduced the number of errors in all scenarios considered. When read length was increased from 100 nt to 200 nt, the tBLASTx overall error decreased five times to 0.13%, while average error for 400 nt reads was decreased to 0.0015%. Finally, the number of errors was extremely dependent on the type of virus (Table  S2) . BLASTx-nr total errors ranged from 7.4% for norovirus to 94.5% for rotavirus for 100 nt reads. Total error rates in rotavirus were high end outliers to the other genome sequences due to the high similarity of genome sequences between human and animal rotaviruses.",

            "text": "Use of the viral database with either BLASTn or tBLASTx search programs and read lengths greater than 200 nt is recommended for annotating human pathogen diversity in environmental virome sequences. This recommendation is, however, specific for the goal of pathogen identification and differs from the common practice of using BLASTx for annotating functional genes and nonpathogenic viruses in previous metagenome studies (Breitbart et al. 2002; Angly et al. 2006; Vega Thurber et al. 2008; Djikeng et al. 2009; Lopez-Bueno et al. 2009; Coetzee et al. 2010) . Here, the BLAST search program tBLASTx was used to annotate human pathogens from the biosolids virome. Higher error rates in the translated nucleotide to amino acid BLASTx searches are likely due to the presence of noncoding viral genome regions in queries. Searches conducted by tBLASTx include nonprotein encoding regions that are left out of BLASTx searchers. Although the percent errors associated with the nucleotide to nucleotide BLASTn searches were statistically indistinguishable to those associated with the translated nucleotide to translated nucleotide tBLASTx searches, the latter offers advantages associated with amino acid conservation that are not included in BLASTn searches. This amino acid conservation advantage is demonstrated in the biosolids virome sequencing effort where a BLASTn search of the viral nucleotide database yielded only 8,726 sequence identifications compared to the total of 51,925 sequences identifications using tBLASTx. Finally, and in addition to decreased computational time, advantages of the focused virus database are that it does not include similar sequences from non-target organisms that may be deposited into full databases and thus results in lower ambiguity than the full NCBI database. Physical separation of virus sized particles and destruction of free DNA and RNA during sample preparation ensure that the gene sequences produced were of viral origin and obviate the need for annotation using databases that contain additional, nonviral, nucleic acid sequences.",

Coronavirus is recognized as a major cause of the common cold (Falsey et al. 2002) and 95% of humans are infected with parechovirus within two to five years of age (Joki-Korpela and Hyypi\u00e4 2001) . Commonly used enterovirus qPCR primers do not include parechovirus, thus this virus's presence has not been reflected in previous qPCR enterovirus monitoring (Wong et al. 2010) . Although commonly enumerated in class B biosolids (Gerba et al. 2002) , enteroviruses were not detected by this study. TTV also circulates in healthy individuals with an estimated worldwide prevalence of 80%, and researchers have suggested its use as a fecal indicator (Bendinelli et al. 2001; Griffin et al. 2008 ). Both Aichi virus and parechovirus have been identified by a sequencing efforts in reused wastewater (Rosario et al. 2009 ), providing support for their presence in wastewater residuals. Among viral agents described that do not have environmental exposure routes, herpes virus may be carried by as much as 90% of the population (Arbuckle et al. 2010 ).",

Obtaining a more unbiased view of virus diversity through virome production is labor intensive and costly. Given limited database size and the inherent genetic similarity between host specific viruses, some level of classification error may always be present. An example of this is the unexpected identifications by this sequencing effort of Variola virus (Table S3 ). Since smallpox (Variola virus) has been eradicated worldwide since 1980 it is likely that these identifications are from some other member of the family Poxviridae. While the results indicate that some form of Poxviridae are present, these known ambiguities highlight the need to accompany virus metagenome-based pathogen identifications with more in depth, confirmatory analysis. The ability to distinguish host specificity was demonstrated in our in silico study, however, this may not extend to all viruses. These limitations suggest that rather than applying massively parallel sequencing as the only form of virus detection, a more appropriate approach for using virus metagenome information is to describe the viral pathogen diversity of a class of environmental samples (e.g. class B biosolids) in order to efficiently guide quantitative and confirmatory analysis of selected agents of interest.",

An annotation approach specific for pathogen identification is described that delineates appropriate BLAST programs (tBLASTx, BLASTn), databases (viral-only database) and required sequence lengths (>200nt) to achieve less than 1% error in viral pathogen classification. Several viruses not previously identified in biosolids, including coronavirus, herpes virus, TTV, and parechovirus, were identified and ranked as highly abundant compared to adenoviruses. These results indicate the importance of obtaining an unbiased view of viral pathogen diversity as a guide for subsequent cell culture and specific quantitative PCR investigations required to fully understand biosolids pathogen content.",
