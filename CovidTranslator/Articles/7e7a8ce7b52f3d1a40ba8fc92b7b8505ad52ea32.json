Daily intravenous infusions of HBOC (1.95, 3.90, or 5.85 g/kg/day) during gestational days (GDs) 6-18 in Sprague-Dawley rats caused fetal mortality, reduced birth weight, and malformations. Subsequent single-day infusions (5.85 g/kg/day) showed that developmental toxicity was limited to GDs 7-9 when histiotrophic nutrition via the inverted visceral yolk sac (invVYS) is essential. Histiotrophic nutrition is receptor-mediated endocytosis of bulk maternal proteins and subsequent lysosomal degradation providing amino acids and other nutrients for embryonic growth. Controls for protein content, oncotic properties, and hemoglobin content indicated that toxicity was due to hemoglobin. Rat whole embryo cultures verified HBOC interference with invVYS transport capacity and resultant deficient embryonic nutrition. These mechanisms of action are not expected to impact human development based on differences in VYS morphology and function, although a complete understanding of early human embryonic nutrition is lacking.",

Initial experiments examined developmental toxicity resulting from a dose of HBOC-201 (1.95 up to \u223c6 g/kg/day) chosen to represent multiples of the highest proposed human dose to be given in one day. HBOC-201 was infused during gestational days (GDs) 6-18, a treatment period that encompasses major organogenesis in the rat. This treatment was associated with embryolethality and a high malformation rate in the initial experiments; further experiments in pregnant rats were performed in order to identify specific sensitive periods during organogenesis when HBOC-201 infusion produces the most pronounced developmental toxicity. Additional studies were performed in order to investigate whether changes in osmotic pressure, properties of the HBOC-201 component not related to hemoglobin, and/or an increase in oxidative stress were underlying factors that might explain or exacerbate the observed toxicity. Because developmental toxicity was only present when dams were intravenously infused with HBOC-201 during the GD 7-9 ranges, a period when the inverted visceral yolk sac (invVYS) provides the primary source of embryonic nutrition, supplementary experiments in whole embryo culture were conducted to determine if HBOC-201 interferes with the normal endocytotic functions of the invVYS in the rodent.",

The animals were then removed from the incubator, placed in a restrainer, and connected to an infusion pump administering saline at a rate of approximately 1 mL/min via the indwelling cannula. Simultaneously, blood was slowly withdrawn using a heparinized, temporary indwelling catheter (24 gauge), placed in the lateral tail vein. During blood withdrawal, the tail was stroked in a caudal direction to assist blood flow. The target blood withdrawal volume was 10-15 mL at a rate of approximately 1 mL/min. The total amount of infusate given to HBOC-201-treated and control animals through the indwelling catheter was three times the total volume of withdrawn blood. Infusion occurred in two phases. The first phase was 46 mL/kg HBOC-201 administered at a rate of approximately 0.2 mL/min over an approximate one-hour infusion period. The volume of the first phase of infusate was recorded. The second phase was made up of saline infused at a rate of 1 mL/min until the total volume of saline plus phase 1 infusate totaled three times the volume of blood that had been withdrawn from the tail vein. Control animals received saline only in both phases of infusion. After the rats had been removed from restraint they were returned to their cages, and reconnected to their tethering system.",

The following is an overview of the assay with slight modifications. Conceptuses were rinsed and transferred to a drop of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM), two conceptuses per 250 L drop. Conceptuses were dissected in the drop, releasing the extra-embryonic fluid (EEF) contained in the invVYS and amnion into the drop, which was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube. The EEF also contains a small amount of conceptal blood that leaks into the collection fluid. The invVYS were placed in cold 0.1% Triton X-100. Previous experimentation has confirmed that no significant amounts of intact FITC-albumin, FITC bound to peptide fragments, or other forms of solubilized FITC reach the embryo proper during this procedure. The embryos were, therefore, discarded and not included in the subsequent analyses. The invVYS were sonicated and 20 L taken from each sample for protein determination by the method described by Bradford [11] as modified by Harris et al. [14] . Proteins were precipitated from the EEF, invVYS, and 250 L media samples by adding 750 L of 6% trichloroacetic (TCA) to each. To determine the total FITC-albumin in the 20 L media samples, protein was solubilized using 750 L of 6% TCA containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Samples were refrigerated overnight for 15 h to fully precipitate or solubilize protein, respectively, and then centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min, to remove the supernatant (which contains acid soluble albumin fragments). One milliliter of 500 mM Tris buffer and 150 L of 1 N NaOH were added to the acid-soluble supernatant and the samples (approximate pH of 8.8) were quantified on a Perkin-Elmer Model LS 5 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer, 495 nm excitation, 520 nm emission, 10 nm slit widths and scale 8. One hundred-fifty mL of 1 N NaOH was added to the pellets which contain acid insoluble albumin. The pellets were allowed to dissolve at room temperature for about 1 h. One milliliter of 500 mM Tris, 250 L of 0.1% Triton X-100, and 750 L of 6% TCA were then added to these acidinsoluble pellets, and the solubilized material was analyzed for fluorescence.",

In comparison to saline controls, HBOC-201 infused dams in all dosage groups exhibited a reduction in maternal weight gain. One female in the 5.85 g/kg/day HBOC-201 treated group was euthanized on GD 8 due to overt discomfort, and another female in this group was found dead on GD 15.

The absence of statistical significance with regard to pairwise comparisons between HBOC-201 versus saline is both a function of the small number of litters and also the reduced intensity of the fetal examinations. In screening studies, complete evaluations of fetuses (which would include visceral and skeletal examinations in a definitive study) are typically not performed. However, because developmental toxicity includes alterations in fetal weights in addition to malformations, it is possible to obviate the statistical issues by combining the fetal weight data from the four-day span of GD 6-7 to GD 10-11 (the time period that precedes the full functioning of the chorioallantoic placenta). The comparison for potential developmental toxicity of the combined GD 6-10 hetastarch-treated and HBOC-201-treated groups includes a total of 23 litters in each treatment group, with a total of 332 fetuses from hetastarch-treated dams and 318 fetuses from HBOC-201-treated dams. The hetastarch fetuses (3.69 \u00b1 0.42 g) were significantly heavier than those in the HBOC-201 group (3.27 \u00b1 0.32 g) when analyzed by Dunnett's test (p \u2264 0.05). This analysis demonstrates a developmentally toxic effect of treatment that was not related to the osmolality of the HBOC. Because fetal weight is considered the most sensitive endpoint of developmental toxicity, this shows that during the pre-chorioallantoic placenta period, HBOC-201 fetuses experienced developmental toxicity even though external malformations were observed only during treatment on GDs 6-9.",

The chorioallantoic placenta of the rat develops from the ectoplacental cone which begins to become vascularized on the fetal side by allantoic arteries during GD 11 [17] . Prior to that time, however, the tissue of the ectoplacental cone develops sinusoids that become filled with maternal blood. This diverts some of the volume of maternal blood away from the invYSP, as shown by the detailed microsphere data of Buelke-Sam et al. [18] . This reduction in flow to the invYSP is likely sufficient to have reduced the impact of HBOC on that membrane to the extent that only fetal body weight was affected.",

            "text": "To determine whether the maternal and developmental toxicity observed following HBOC-201 infusion could be attributed to a change in oncotic pressure, rats were hemodiluted and infused with 46 mL/kg (6 g/kg) HBOC-201 or 46 mL/kg saline on GD 9 ( Table 3 ). The data indicate that maternal weight gain from the day of infusion until euthanasia (GD 9-20) was markedly lower in hemodiluted dams infused with HBOC-201 (42 \u00b1 31.7 g) compared to hemodiluted dams infused with an equivalent volume of saline (80 \u00b1 20.8 g). Because net body weight gain (weight gain minus the weight of the gravid uterus) in the HBOC-201 group was similar to the saline control group, the lower maternal weight gain was attributed to the high rate of embryolethality and lower fetal body weights observed in the HBOC-201 group. Other overt signs of maternal toxicity, observed only in hemodiluted dams infused with HBOC-201, included reddened body areas and red urine. Additionally, the mean number of viable fetuses (5.6 \u00b1 5.48 g compared to 11.3 \u00b1 5.35 g) and the mean fetal weight (2.7 \u00b1 0.84 g compared to 3.5 \u00b1 0.40 g) in the HBOC-201 group were lower than in the saline-infused controls. The mean litter percentage of external malformations in the HBOC-201 group was \u223c62% while no external malformations were observed in fetuses born to hemodiluted animals infused with saline. Malformations consisted primarily of microphthalmia and cephalocele. In a second hemodilution study, hemodiluted dams were infused with saline, hetastarch, or 6 g/kg PBH on GD 9. This is the same dosage of HBOC-201 used in the first hemodilution study. Maternal and developmental toxicity data associated with these groups are presented in Table 4 . Neither maternal nor developmental toxicity was observed in the hemodiluted animals infused with saline or hetastarch. However, hemodiluted dams infused with PBH gained significantly less weight (52 g \u00b1 32.7 g) from the day of infusion until euthanasia (GD 9-20) than hemodiluted dams infused with saline and hetastarch; 126 \u00b1 38.2 g and 110 \u00b1 17.9 g, respectively. Because net body weight gain in the PBH group was similar to the saline control group, the lower maternal weight gain was attributed to the high rate of embryolethality and lower fetal body weights observed in the PBH group. Overt signs of maternal toxicity in the hemodiluted group infused with 6 g/kg PBH were similar to those observed in the HBOC-201 treatment group. PBH infusion of hemodiluted dams led to a reduction in the number of viable fetuses, as well as a reduction in fetal weights. In litters from hemodiluted animals the mean number of viable fetuses per litter and mean fetal weights were reduced after infusion with PBH, but not after infusion with saline or hetastarch. The mean litter percentage of external malformations was increased (75.1 \u00b1 35.46%) in hemodiluted dams infused with 6 g/kg PBH, whereas the incidence of external malformation was very low in fetuses of hemodiluted dams infused with saline and hetastarch. The malformations observed in the PBH group fetuses consisted primarily of microphthalmia and hydrocephaly. Thus, HBOC-201 and PBH resulted in similar teratogenic profiles, indicating that the hemoglobin component of HBOC-201 is essential to the observed toxicity.",

Investigation to define the timing of embryotoxicity revealed that malformed fetuses were observed after maternal infusion with HBOC-201 primarily on GDs 8 and 9. This time period coincides with the appearance and early functioning of the rat invVYS during GD 7 [17] . Additionally, the rather abrupt disappearance of malformations in exposed litters after GDs 10-11 was concurrent with the development of the chorioallantoic placenta of the rat, which becomes well established during GD 11. Because the histiotrophic mechanism for transport of nutrients and other cargoes by the invVYS differs from that of the chorioallantoic placenta, which works by countercurrent exchange of substances between closely apposed maternal and embryonal circulations [19] [20] [21] , and because the adverse embryonic effects were not produced after the chorioallantoic placenta was fully functioning, the embryotoxic effects appear to be related to impaired invVYS function. The FITC-albumin uptake and DNA content studies also indicate that early exposure of embryos to HBOC-201 impaired the endocytotic capacity of the invVYS.",

Much of the Hb toxicity is due to perturbed redox balance as the ferrous ion (Fe II ) in the heme moiety is oxidized to ferric ion (Fe III ) in the presence of oxygen, generating a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxide (reviewed in [2, 25, 26] ). Young embryos, however, exist in a hypoxic state until the establishment of the uteroplacental circulation and subsequent oxygen enrichment by forming the chorioallantoic placenta. These two temporally distinct gestational milestones increase physiologic exchange of nutrients and gases between mother and the embryo. As the amount of oxygen reaching the embryo increases, the morphology of embryonic mitochondria changes to handle the increased oxygen exposure efficiently and without toxicity [27, 28] . If the effects of HBOC were due to the creation of ROS, it would be expected that the effects on the embryos would increase concomitantly with elevated oxygen levels reaching the embryo subsequent to establishment of the chorioallantoic placenta. In this case, however, the adverse effects on embryos decreased after the chorioallantoic placenta was formed, suggesting that the Hbassociated toxicity is not due to ROS.",

First, the lack of developmental toxicity in the hetastarch control group demonstrates that the developmental toxicity is not merely the result of an imbalance in oncotic pressure, but must be due to a separate property of the polymer or the hemoglobin component of HBOC-201. Second, the lack of developmental toxicity after infusion of the human serum albumin indicates that the developmental impact is not due to high protein concentrations added to the maternal blood volume. Third, the hemodilution experiments investigated the possibility that the developmental toxicity could have been secondary to anemia or an increase in the circulating blood volume of the pregnant rats. Fetal outcomes in hemodiluted rats that were infused with HBOC-201, however, did not differ substantively from fetal outcomes of the non-hemodiluted rats. Together, these controls indicate that the developmental toxicity is not the result of increased oncotic pressure caused by increased blood volume or the colloidal properties of HBOC-201. Fourth, the developmental toxicity resulting from infusion of PBH shows that the effects caused by HBOC-201 are associated with the large molecular weight protein, hemoglobin.",

If this is indeed the mechanism of action of HBOC-201 in the rodent, differences in the anatomy and function of the vestigial human VYS suggest that these mechanisms may not be relevant in human development. Like all eutherian mammals, humans possess a well-defined yolk sac during early postimplantation development and organogenesis [33] . The yolk sac endodermal epithelium is polarized and, similar to other epithelia, will endocytose nutrient materials from the VYS lumen, especially during the first trimester prior to full activation of placental function [34] [35] [36] [37] . Unlike the rodent, human yolk sac membranes never become directly apposed to the chorion (the outer most embryonic membrane within which the conceptus resides) or the maternal uterine wall or uterine lumen [16, 20, 33, 38] . This means that the human yolk sac membrane does not function as a placenta in the sense of being able to transfer nutrients between maternal and conceptual circulations [39] . Furthermore, the human yolk sac does not invert to encompass the embryo which means that materials originating from human blood (such as HBOC) first must diffuse or be actively transported into the spherical yolk sac lumen prior to being endocytosed by the polarized yolk sac endothelium. The yolk sac remains small relative to the size of the developing, major organogenesis stage embryo [33, 38] , suggesting that that the surface area available for transport in human embryos is small compared to that of rodents. Based on these considerations, we believe that it is unlikely that interference with human VYS function will contribute to hemoglobin embryotoxicity.",

Because rodents and lagomorphs rely on inverted yolk sac during early gestation, they are inappropriate models for assessing the developmental toxicity of molecular substances such as HBOC-201 that may poison the invVYS. Among commonly used experimental models used in safety testing, nonhuman primates and dogs do not have inverted yolk sacs [20, 40] . Studies with non-human primates are lengthy, expensive, and pose ethical issues for use in general safety tests. However, there is a substantial amount of experience in using dogs in safety assessment studies for other disciplines and a significant body of general toxicological and physiological information has been developed [41, 42] . Thus, developmental toxicity studies performed in a canine model ( [43] submitted companion paper) could verify that the developmental toxicity of HBOC-201 in the rat is indeed due solely to poisoning of the invVYS.",
