            "text": "A persistently-infected neuroblastoma culture [Neuro-2A(JHMV)] was established with the murine hepatitis virus JHM [MHV-JHM]. After t00 days of passage, the endogenous virus [Neuro-2A(JHMV)end] released by this culture was unable to induce the syncytia typical of MHV-JHM and the endogenous virus was not temperature-sensitive. The Neuro-2A (JHMV) culture was cured of virus production by passage under neutralizing antibody [Neuro-2A (JHMV)Ab]. The Neuro-2A (JHMV) and the Neuro-2A (JHMV)Ab cultures were as susceptible to heterologous infection with mengovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus as the uninfected Neuro-2A culture. However, the Neuro-2A(JHMV) and Neuro-2A(JHMV)Ab cultures were partiMly resistant to homologous superinfection by MHV-JHM and the closely related MHV-A59. Virus related to MHV-JHM was rescued from the antibody-cured cells by cell fusion. The synthesis of MHV-JHM specific antigens by Neuro-2A (JHMV) cells, Neuro-2A (JHMV)Ab cells and 17C1-1 cells infected by Neuro-2A(JHMV)end was studied by SDS-PAGE. The genomic RNAs of MHV-JHM and Neuro-2A(JHMV) end were compared by o]igonucleotide mapping. The results of the protein and RNA studies indicated that the genome of Neuro-2A(JHMV)end was substantially modified from the genome of MHV-JHM, but the modifications did not significantly alter the molecular size of the virM-specific proteins. 22*",

Several attempts were made to rescue virus from the antibody-cured cells by cocult4vation with 17C1-1 cells. At various times after initiation, the cocultures were tested for viral antigen by immunofluorescence and for virus multiplication by plaque assay and end-point dilution assay. No viral antigens or infectious viruses were detected. When the Neuro-2A(JHMV)Ab cells were fused to 17C1-1 cells with polyethylene glycol, focal lysis was observed in 3 to 4 days in 3 trials (fusions were done at 174, 195 and 209 days after the Neuro-2A (JHMV)Ab line was established). Infectious rescued virus was detected by the endpoint dilution assay. The yield of virus obtained from the 3 trials was in the range of i0~ to 104 IU per 106 cells. Several plaque assays were attempted at 33 \u00b0, 37 \u00b0 and 39\u00b0C to detect infectious rescued virus. The assays were observed daily for 7 days. No plaques were observed at any of the temperatures tested. The reason for this is not known. No infectious virus was detected in parallel unfused cultures. Two clones of rescued virus obtained were recloned by the end-point dilution method. The rescued virus was designated Neuro-2A (JHMV)res.",

These RNAs formed a nested set of 6 subgenomic sized RNAs in addition to the genomic sized RNA as determined by oligonucleotide mapping. The genomic sized RNA was designated RNA-1. The subgenomie species were designated RNA-2 to RNA-6 in order of decreasing size. At least. 6 differences were observed in the oligonucleotide patterns of MHV-JHM and Neuro-2A(JHMV)end (Fig. 5) . One spot (arrowhead 1) was present in the Nenro-2A(JHMV)end genome, but not in the MHV-JHM genome. This probably represents an alteration in the oligonucleotide indicated by arrowhead 2 in the MHV-JHM genome. Arrowheads 2---6 indicate oligonucleotides detected in the MHV-JHM genome, but not in the Neuro-2A (JHMV)end genome. We have determined that oligonucleotide 2 was from the 5' region of RNA-3, oligonucleotides 3 and 4 were from the 5' region of RNA-1, and oligonucleotides 5 and 6 were from the 5' region of RNA-2. SIDD~:LL et al. (22) demonstrated that I~NA-3 codes for the precursor to the glycoprotein E 2. Others have implicated the E2 protein in MHV-induced cell fusion (3, 8) . Thus, the modification in the t~NA-3 portion of the genome which codes for E 2 may result in the syn(--) phenotype.",

The efficiency of plating (EOP), the ratio of the virus titer at 39 \u00b0 C to the virus titer at, 33 \u00b0 C, of Neuro-2A(JHMV)end was 1.06 compared to 0.93 for MHV-JHM. To determine if multiplication was ts, i7Cl-1 cells were acutely infected with the endogenous virus or MHV-JHM and incubated at 33 \u00b0 or 39\u00b0C for 16 hours. The virus yields were determined by plaque assay at 33 \u00b0 C. The ratio of the yield of the acute infection at 39 \u00b0 C to the yield at, 33 \u00b0 C was 0.86 for Neuro-2A(JHMV)end as compared to 0.39 for MHV-JHM. To further confirm these results, 25 clones of this stock of endogenous virus were selected by plaque assay and tested for temperature sensitivity at 39 \u00b0 and 33 \u00b0 C. All of the clones had efficiencies of plating between 0.2 and 5.0. MHV-JHM had an EOP of 0.93. These data indicate that the endogenous virus was not significantly ts.",

The MOI of the mengovirus and VSV was varied from 0.1 to10 PFU/ml. The yields obtained did not vary as a function of MO[ (data not shown). To further test for the presence of interferon in the Neuro-2A(JHMV) culture, supernatant Neuro-2A(JItMV) culture fluid obtained at 190 days postestablishment was layered onto monolayers of DBT ceils overnight. The monotayers were then infected with 20 PFU of VSV per dish in duplicate and overlaid with medium containing agarose. The VSV plaques were counted at 32 hours PI. There was no difference in yield between the control cultures (no supernatant cell culture fluid) and the experimental cultures. No plaques due to endogenous virus were evident at the time that the VSV plaques were read. The susceptibility of the cultures Neuro-2A(JHMV) and Neuro-2A (JHMV)Ab to homologous infection by MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 was determined. Limited syneytia and lysis typicM of an acute infection by MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM in 17Cl-1 cells were observed in the Neuro-2A parent culture. However, CPE was not, observed at any time in either the Neuro-2A (JHMV) or Neuro-2A (JHMV) Ab cultures. Paradoxically, the yield of virus obtained from superinfected cultures (Table l) suggest that these cultures may not be resistant, to superhffection by MHV-JHM or MHV-A59. To further investigate this observation, virus released by the Neuro-2A(JHMV) cells infected by MHV-JHM or MHV-A59 was cloned by plaque assay. Fifteen clones were tested from each infection.

The Neuro-2A (JHMV) Ab culture was assayed at 132, 146 and 157 days after antibody curing. Cells(1 to 1.57< 106)were seeded into 6-well cluster dishes and incubated at 37 \u00b0 C. The monolayers were washed once with DME-2 and infected with 0.2 ml of the indicated virus. The MOI of MHV-JttM and MHV-A59 was 0.t PFU/cell, and of VSV and mengovim~s was 1,0 P_FU/cell. The dishes were incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 24 hours and the virus was titrated by plaque assay. The results are expressed as the mean and standard deviation of independent determinations b The endogenous virus titer is representative of the amount of virus released by the cells when mock-infected, The sensitivity of the assay is 10 PFU/10 6 cells. c The yield of virus obtained in these infections was silw-ilar to the amount of endogenous virus released by the cells when mock infected. It was not possible to reliably differentiate between the yield due to endogenous virus and the yield due to superinfection by plaque size. Fifteen clones were isolated from each infection and tested for the ability to form syneytia. All were negative suggesting that the released virus was endogenous virus (17C1-1) were acutely infected by each clone and the CPE monitored by phase-contrast microscopy. No syncytia were observed in any of the clonal infections at any time. These results suggest that the virus yielded was endogenous virus, not progeny virus due to the superinfecting MHV-JHM or MHV-A 59.Inter/erence with MH V MultiplicationSupernatant cell culture fluids were collected from the persistentlyinfected culture Neuro-2A (JHMV) at 190 days postestablishment. Dilutions of the supernatant fluids were tested for the ability to interfere with the multiplication of MHV-JHM or MHV-A59 in 17 C]-I cells (data not shown). No interference in the multiplication of standard virus was detected. In addition, 2 different pools of Neuro-2A(JHMV)end (isolated at 196 days and 220 days postestablishment) were serially passaged 5 times in L2 cells without dilution. The MOI of the first passage was 0.3 PFU per cell.Aliquots of each serial passage were saved and subsequently assayed for the ability to interfere with the multiplication of standard MHV-JHM in L2 cells and t7Cl-1 cells. Although the titers of the virus yields declined approximately 50 fold during serial passage, no interference with the multiplication of MHV-JHM was detected by plaque assay. These results indicate that defective-interfering particles were not present in the persistently-infected culture or selected for during multiplication in L2 cells. The mechanism for the decrease in titer of the Neuro-2A(JHMV)end during serial undiluted passage is currently under investigation.",

The results shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the MHV-JHM specific proteins were present in the Neuro-2 A (JttMV) culture, but absent in the Neuro-2 A (JHMV)Ab or Neuro-2A cultures.

The MHV-JHM specific antigens synthesized in the acute infection of 17 C1-1 cells by MHV-JHM and Neuro-2A (JHMV)end appeared similar.
