However, many pilgrims may not be aware of MERS-CoV and other infection diseases in Saudi Arabia. For instance, a study among French pilgrims showed that only 64.7% of them were aware of MERS-CoV (Gautret P, et al., 2013) . Nevertheless, subsequently, there have been fresh sparks of MERS-CoV early this year with consequent wider media coverage; therefore, we conducted this survey to explore Australian pilgrims' awareness of MERS-CoV and knowledge about the transmission of common respiratory infections.",

Vaccinees were invited to participate in a questionnaire-based survey while they were waiting in the observation room, before or after the receipt of vaccines. Following a short briefing about the study, informed consent was obtained from each participant who agreed to join the survey; knowledge about respiratory infections was assessed using a 13-point questionnaire. Pilgrims' demographics, previous Hajj attendance and history of chronic medical conditions were also collected. Pilgrims completed the surveys themselves; however, research team members helped those who were unable to complete the questionnaires themselves. Ethics approval was obtained from Hunter New England Research Ethics Committee (HREC reference number 13/05/3.05).",
