The numbers of those affected are rising and as countries start reporting fresh cases every day, there is widespread panic and anxiety related to an unknown illness. Even though the mortality rate is far lesser than its earlier congeners Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), this is not enough to allay the fear of getting affected in millions (Velavan and Meyer, 2020) . Apart from countries like China, South Korea and Iran suffering huge economic losses, there are burden of strict quarantine measures, restrictions to travel, and heavy screening and monitoring. Added to this is the plethora of misinformation circulating in the social media that add to the anxiety about the illness. Misinfodemics is the term used for misinformation contributing to the spread of illness and that is quite prevalent for COVID-19 (Gyenes and Mina, 2018) . In spite of clear guidelines by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people resort to wrong methods of treatment thus neglecting the precautionary measures, contributing even more to the spread. Added to this is marginalization and stigmatization arising out of this fear of an unknown infection.",

            "text": "As researchers all over toil hard for an effective anti-viral and vaccine against COVID-19, the psychological impact of the illness is largely neglected. Pandemics like this, are not just a medical phenomenon; they tend to affect quality of life in an individual and as a whole, causing social dysfunction. Stigma, xenophobia, mass hysteria and panic are the common offshoots. As the global prevalence increases, people start hoarding medical supplies, isolate themselves physically, restrict social interaction and enter into a constant state of health-anxiety even over mild conditions that can mimic the illness, like common cold (Duan and Zhu, 2020) . People with mental illness are especially vulnerable to these effects, as are the health-care workers in hospitals and laboratories, the volunteers and social service personnel and those quarantined for prolonged duration. Recent literature states that even though online and at-site psychological services have been initiated in China, the lack of sensitization and training in mental health often adversely affect the performance and health outcome of the medical staff there (Chen et al., 2020) .",
