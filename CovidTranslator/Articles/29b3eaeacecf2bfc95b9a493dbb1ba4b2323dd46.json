The transmission characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be similar to those of pandemic influenza and will likely facilitate further global spread [2] . During this early phase of a potential pandemic, it is critically important to obtain reliable estimates of the overall case fatality ratio (CFR), i.e., the proportion of all (asymptomatic and symptomatic) infected cases that will die as a result of the disease. Such estimates will help anticipate the expected morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 and provide critical information for the planning of health care systems in countries that face an epidemic.",

A crude CFR of 2.3% was estimated based on 1,023 deaths out of 44,672 confirmed cases reported until February 11, 2020 [5] . So-called \"crude estimates\" of CFR from the reported numbers of confirmed cases and deaths are difficult to interpret due to the likely under-ascertainment of mild or asymptomatic cases and the right-censoring of cases with respect to the time delay from illness onset to death. Some analyses attempted to correct for right-censoring of deaths, leading to an estimate of CFR of 7.2% (95% confidence interval: 6.6%-8.0%) for Hubei province using a competing risk model [6] . Using data on exported cases and correcting for right-censoring of deaths occurred in China, another team reported a CFR estimate of 5.3% (95% confidence interval: 3.5%, 7.5%) among confirmed cases [7] . Finally, another team reported a CFR of 18% (95% credible interval: 11-81%) among cases detected in Hubei, accounting for the delay in mortality [8] . The same study provided adjusted estimates of the overall CFR based on data from the early epidemic in Hubei and from cases reported outside China at 1% (95% CI: 0.5%-4%). With the objective of correcting all listed biases, we fitted a dynamic transmission model to reported data of confirmed cases and deaths in Hubei [9] and obtained adjusted and age-specific estimates of the overall CFR of COVID-19 among both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the Hubei province until 11 February 2020.

Early January 2020, a novel coronavirus (subsequently named SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causal agent of the epidemic [11] . In a first phase of the epidemic, human-to-human transmission occurred at a high rate in Wuhan and other areas of the Hubei province, leading to an exponential growth of incidence ( Figure 1A ). On 20 January, Chinese authorities implemented strict control measures in the Hubei province, including contact tracing aimed at identifying , treating and isolating cases and quarantining contacts, extension of holidays, temperature checks before accessing public areas, cancellation of mass gatherings and the promotion of extreme social distancing [10] . Three days later, a cordon sanitaire was imposed, with strict traffic restrictions. From 27 January, the daily incidence of cases by disease onset started plateauing, then decreased. The Chinese CDC published a description of the epidemiological characteristics of cases reported until 11 February 2020, including the age distribution of cases and deaths reported up to this point in China, that we applied to Hubei ( Figure 1B ).",

We stratified the population by 10-year ranges, leading to 9 age classes (0-9 years old, ..., 80 years old and more). After an incubation period of 5.6 days [12] , 49% of infected people develop symptoms and become infectious [13] while the remaining remain asymptomatic and do not transmit the disease further. This proportion of 49% of symptomatic was estimated by testing every passenger on the Diamond Princess ship ( Figure 1C ). We then fixed the time from onset to removal to 2.9 days [14] . These parameters are identical across all age classes. Figure 2 : Schematic description of the COVID-19 transmission model. We considered five compartments for each age group k: susceptible S k , exposed E k , symptomatically infected I k , asymptomatically infected A k , and removed R k . The cumulative incidence of symptomatic cases is recorded in compartment C k , from which we compute the daily incidence of reported cases J k and the daily incidence of deaths D k . Model parameters: transmission rate \u03b2, incubation rate \u03c4 , probability of symptomatic infection \u03c8, removal rate \u00b5, reporting rate of symptomatics \u03c1 k (by age group), probability of death k among symptomatics (by age group), and delay from disease onset to death \u03b3 (discretized by day).",

Under our assumption regarding the distribution of the delay between disease onset and death, the model predicts a total of 2,441 deaths (95%CrI: 2,225-2702) among all people infected before 11 February. This results in an adjusted CFR of 1.6% (95%CrI: 1.4-1.8) among all people infected by COVID-19 in Hubei during that period. Moreover, our adjustment leads to sensible modifications of the age-specific CFR (Table 1) . Compared to the crude CFR, the adjusted CFR is even lower in the younger age classes (0-59 years old) but higher in people aged 60 and more.",

(1) Our results depend on the central assumption that the cause of the deficit of reported cases among younger age groups is a surveillance bias and does not reflect a lower risk of infection in younger individuals. The reason for this age shift is unknown [10] . Retrospective testing for COVID-19 of samples from influenza-like-illness surveillance found no positive test among children, but the sample sizes were small (20 per week including both adults and children) [10] . Uneven age distributions in the risk of infection can be attributed to immunological features, such as the lower circulation of H1N1 influenza in older individuals due to residual immunity [17] . An immunological explanation of the opposite phenomenon, with a lower susceptibility of younger individuals, seems unlikely, and there is no indication of pre-existing immunity to COVID-19 in humans [10] . Different contact patterns could play a role in a limited outbreak, but not in such a widespread infection, especially as household transmission seems to play a major role [10] . The last explanation that we assume here is that younger individuals, when symptomatic, have milder symptoms that decrease the probability of seeking care and being identified.",

The proportion of symptomatic infections has been estimated to 58% (95% confidence interval: 33-83) in a small sample of cases exported to Japan [19] . During the outbreak on the ship \"Diamond Princess\", nearly all individuals were tested regardless of symptoms, leading to an average proportion of symptomatic infections of 49% in a sample size of 619, which was used in the present study [13] . Still, uncertainty about the proportion of symptomatic infections will remain until a large retrospective seroprevalence study is conducted in the general population, and our results are dependent on this estimate. Additionally, the dichotomization of infection into asymptomatic and symptomatic is a simplification of reality; the infection with SARS-CoV-2, will likely cause a gradient of symptoms in different individuals depending on age, sex and comorbidities [10] . The proportion of asymptomatic infections might show an age-dependent structure.",
