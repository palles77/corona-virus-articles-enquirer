The N protein gene has been cloned into a yeast expression vector pPIC9, transformed into Pichia pastoris strain GS115 and induced for expression by methanol. SDS-PAGE and Western blot showed that the N protein was expressed at a level of 3 mg/ml of culture medium. Characterization by mass spectrometry, circular dichroism and fluorescence luminescence assays showed that the expressed N protein displayed a \u2424-sheet secondary structure in solution and it is stable in the pH range between 5.0 and 8.0. The P. pastoris-expressed N protein is believed to more closely resemble native SARS N protein than the bacterially expressed N protein.",

It is confirmed that there was indeed N protein expression in the culture supernatant (Fig. 1B ). To test the expression level of the N protein, time course experiments indicated that there was a direct relationship between band intensity and methanol induction time. The N protein expression level reached 3 mg/ml of culture medium. It showed a steady increase of the N protein expression over the methanol induction time (Fig. 1C) .",

The P. pastoris expression system is one of the promising methods for the production of expressed proteins, although at present limited viral proteins have been expressed using this system (Cereghino and Cregg, 2000) . We have cloned the SARS-CoV N gene into the P. pastoris expression vector pPIC9 and achieved efficient expression of the N protein to a level of 3000 mg/l, which is higher than the formerly reported eukaryotic-expressed N protein (526 mg/l; Liu et al., 2004) . In addition, different methods including MS, CD, FL were used to characterize this eukaryotic-expressed N protein. The E. coli-expressed N protein was obtained previously in our laboratory and a polyclonal antibody against this N protein was obtained from rabbit (data not shown). Using the polyclonal antibody raised against bacterially expressed N protein, the yeast-expressed N protein was detected (Fig. 1B ). The N protein expression level reached its peak at 84 h postmethanol induction (Fig. 1A) . This is consistent with the report by Liu et al. (2004) . The MW of the expressed N protein was estimated to be 46.8 kDa. The slight difference in the MW could be due to post-translational modifications or computational errors. The MS results showed complete matching of amino acid sequence from 46% of the trypsindigested peptides. These digested peptides, ranged in size from 0.8 to 2.4 kDa, were sequenced (Fig. 2B ) and the largest peptide sequenced has 36 amino acids ( Fig. 2A) . This is in accordance with the published amino acid sequence of the N protein (Ruan et al., 2003) .",
