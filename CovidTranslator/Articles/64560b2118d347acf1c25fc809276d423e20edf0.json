In this study, two PEDV isolates with similar growth kinetics were successfully propagated in Vero cells. Complete genome sequence analysis showed that they have a 49nt deletion in the ORF3 gene and were classified into Group 1, the same group that includes the classical CV777 strain. Recombination analysis revealed that the event had occurred in the ORF1a gene, at 3596-6819 nt, among the two PEDV isolates and the CV777 and DR13 strains. During their continuous propagation, 14 nonsynonymous mutations occurred in the spike (S) gene of strain JS-2/2014 between generations G5 and G90, but there were no changes between G90 and G100. We assumed that strain JS-2/2014 might be attenuated by the 90th generation. Piglets orally fed with JS-2/2014 G90 showed no clinical symptoms, and no virus was detected in the feces and nasal fluid. In conclusion, JS-2/2014 was successfully identified by screening, was attenuated after propagation in Vero cells, and may serve as a candidate virus for vaccine preparations.",

Further comparison indicated that the S1 genes from our two PEDV isolates were conserved, with amino acid identities of 99.4-99.8%. Nevertheless, they had obvious variation, relative to the domestic PEDV strains isolated before 2014, with amino acid identities of 89.6-91.3%. Analysis of the ORF3 genes revealed 99.2% homology in the encoded amino acid sequence between JSLS-1/2014 and JS-2/2014 isolates, whereas with other strains it reached 100% (e.g., AH/HF/2015, HeB/2015/121, and HLJ/ QQHR/2015). This meant that there is a certain degree of variation between our two PEDV isolates even though their identity is high. In addition, a 49nt sequence was found to be deleted in the ORF3 gene in our two PEDV isolates -a feature also found in the attenuated strains DR13, HLJBY, AH-M, and JS2008. This deletion is a typical characteristic of cell-adapted PEDV strains [17] . On the other hand, the ORF3 gene of other domestic PEDV strains isolated in recent years is intact in the same way as CV777.

            "text": "virus's escape from preexisting immunity. Thus, periodic vaccine updates may be required to ensure sufficient efficacy against emerging virus variants [28] . In the present study, our data revealed that there is little variation in the S gene among the two PEDV isolates, and that they are most similar to the attenuated DR13 strain. To further explore the role of the S gene in virulence, the JS-2/2014 strain was successively cultured, and S gene variation during cultivation was analysed. Of note, we found that there were three amino acid mutations between JS-2/2014 G5 and JS-2/2014 G20, six between JS-2/2014 G20 and JS-2/2014 G50, and five between JS-2/2014 G50 and JS-2/2014 G90. It is worth noting that the amino acid variations between JS-2/2014 G5 and JS-2/2014 G50 were also identified in the DR13 attenuation process. This finding indicates that these missense mutations in the S gene may be related to viral pathogenicity. Furthermore, animal experiments confirmed that piglets orally fed JS-2/2014 G5 (10 6 TCID 50 ) had mild diarrhea and long-term excretion. On the other hand, piglets challenged with JS-2/2014 G90 (10 6 TCID 50 ) appeared asymptomatic, with no virus detected in the feces and nasal fluid, indicating that G90 was attenuated and therefore is potentially safe for vaccine preparations. Moreover, recombination analysis confirmed that this strain has a high probability of being recombined with CV777 and DR13. Most recently, the CH/HNQX-3/14 strain was reported as a CV777 and DR13 strain recombinant with the highly virulent CHN/ ZMDZY/11 strain. Not surprisingly, this strain was detected on a swine farm that is located in the same province as the CHN/ZMDZY/11 strain; both CV777 and DR13 PEDV vaccines were used on this farm [29] . Therefore, it is possible that the virulence-enhanced CV777 and DR13 strains had been present in some areas, resulting in virus recombination.",

The results showed that the plaque morphological features of strains JSLS-1/2014 and JS-2/2014 were similar.
