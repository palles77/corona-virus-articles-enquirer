Subjects in the zinc and placebo groups were evenly matched with respect to sex, race/ethuicity, allergy test status, and age. Overall symptom duration waz significantly less in the zinc group than in the placebo group (mean, 3.8 days vs 6.1 days). The mean severity rating for all symptoms was lower in the zinc group than in the placebo group; this difference, however, was not statistically significant. Allergypositive subjects who used zinc had a statistically significant shorter duration of nasal symptoms than allergy-negative subjects (3.5 days vs 7.6 days). In conclusion, we propose that zinc acetate lozenges may significantly shorten the duration of common cold symptoms and relieve symptoms associated with allergies.",

            "text": "The common cold is the most frequent infection in all age groups in the United States.' About $5.5 billion are spent annually on colds in the United States, yet only about 50% of the people with colds spend money treating them. It is estimated that in the United States more than 1 billion colds occur each year, of which 110 million are disabling; the result is about 300 million days of restricted activity, about 60 million lost days of school, and about 50 million lost days of work. 2 Although it is well recognized that most colds are caused by rhinoviruses, at least $37.5 million worth of antibiotics were prescribed for the common cold in 1994 in the United States.3 This acute respiratory disorder can be induced by more than 200 types of viruses, mainly human rhinoviruses. Other cold viruses infect people at varying times of the year; they include coronavirus, influenza virus, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackievirus, parainfluenza virus, picornavirus, paramyxovirus, adenovirus, and echovirus.4*5 Viruses are usually contagious during the first 3 days of symptoms. 6 Rhinoviruses, which can cause cold symptoms year-round, have been implicated in most cases. More than 100 distinct rhinoviruses exist, making it impossible to produce a useful vaccine. Recent literature offers little support for the use of antihistamines to treat symptoms of the common cold.7 Review of six major studies on vitamin C supplementation gave no evidence that high-dose vitamin C supplementation decreases the incidence of the common cold. 8 In 1974, it was reported that zinc ions inhibit rhinovirus replication.g Since that observation, numerous studies have assessed the efficacy of zinc, given as oral lozenges, for the treatment of common cold symptoms. The effect of zinc lozenges on the duration of common cold symptoms has been inconsistent, perhaps due to different formulations of the zinc. In his Handbook for Curing the Common Cold, Eby\" discusses in great detail his understanding of how zinc ions work. It has been proposed that zinc ions interfere with rhinovirus protein cleavage, protect plasma membranes, attach to the surface of the rhinovirus, and interfere with the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (I&W-l), the docking point for rhinoviruses on the surface of nasal epithelial cells. In 1984, Eby et al\" conducted the first clinical trial using zinc gluconate lozenges and demonstrated that zinc shortened the duration of common cold symptoms. The second clinical trial,\" conducted by the Medical Research Council Common Cold Unit in Salisbury, England, also demonstrated a shorter duration of common cold symptoms when zinc lozenges were used. A recent randomized, doublemasked, placebo-controlled study13 of zinc lozenges at The Cleveland Clinic demonstrated a significantly reduced duration of symptoms of the common cold. Some clinical studies, 1p18 however, showed no improvement in cold symptoms when zinc lozenges were used.",

The mean duration of nasal drainage symptoms by treatment group and al- lergy test status is shown in Table IV . ANOVA showed that the mean duration of nasal drainage symptoms was significantly lower in the zinc group (4.2 * 0.4 days, n = 39) than in the placebo group (6.6 * 0.7 days, n = 38) (F = 10.3; df = 1,73; P = 0.002). However, ANOVA also showed a significant interaction effect between treatment group and allergy status group (F = 4.5; df = 1, 73; P = 0.037). This difference was even more pronounced in allergy-positive subjects (3.5 f 0.5 days in the zinc group vs 7.6 f 1.1 days in the placebo group) than in allergy-negative subjects (4.7 * 0.5 days in the zinc group vs 5.5 * 0.8 days in the placebo group). This finding suggests that persons positive for allergies are more responsive to zinc than allergy-negative persons for relief of nasal drainage symptoms. ANOVA showed no significant differences for any of the symptoms, regardless of the number of days the symptoms existed before entering the study, between treatment groups and allergy status groups. DISCUSSION The results of this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study suggested that using zinc acetate lozenges significantly reduced the duration of common cold symptoms. This study, although descriptive, also demonstrated that all symptoms resolved significantly more quickly in the zinc group than in the placebo group. The mean severity rating was lower in the zinc group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, the mean duration of nasal drainage symptoms in the zinc group was shorter in allergy-positive subjects than in allergy-negative subjects.",

The lozenges used in this study contained 9 mg of zinc in a tablet base of agglomerated dextrose and no other water-soluble ingredients, and they dissolved in the mouth in about 15 minutes.

Approximately 300 enzymes are known to require zinc for their activities. Zinc deficiency in humans is widespread and more prevalent in areas where the population subsists on cereal proteins. Clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency include growth retardation, hypogonadism in males, neurosensory disorders, cell-mediated immunologic dysfunctions, increased maternal morbidity, and premature delivery. Zinc deficiency also adversely affects the proliferation, regulation, and maturity of lymphocytes.26 E.J.PETRUSETAL. The relationship of zinc and the common cold has been well reviewed.\" Most colds are caused by rhinoviruses. 27 Korant et al9 determined that zinc ions inhibit rhinoviral replication and the cleavage of rhinovirus polypeptides. Khinoviruses have been found to bind with ICAM-1, a receptor found on nasal epithelium. It has been proposed2' that zinc ions complex with ICAM-l-binding sites and prevent the rhinovirus from attaching to the nasal tissue, a point briefly mentioned by Korant et al9 in 1974 . If zinc-blocked viruses do not infect nasal tissue cells to replicate, the infectious process would be interrupted and the duration of the cold would be markedly shortened. Zinc is also believed to act as a protease inhibitor in its effect against rhinovirus infections. Other common cold-causing viruses inhibited by zinc ions include herpes simplex Virus29 and coxsackievirus.3o",

With regard to the effect of zinc on allergies, mast cells have been implicated as mediators of type I allergic reactions and common cold symptoms by causing tissue redness, inflammation, nasal congestion, release of mucus from goblet cells, nose and throat pain, tickling and itchiness, and, indirectly, coughing and sneezing. Mast cell-derived reactions result when histamine, heparin, prostaglandins, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis, and various vasoactive amines are released from granules on the surface of mast cells, possibly including kinins. One product of mast cell-induced inflammation in response to rhinoviral infection is fever.l' The inhibitory effect of zinc on histamine release from mast cells is attributed to its action on the stabilization of mast cell membrane.35 Zinc ions were found to stabilize cell plasma membranes and prevent induced histamine and vasoactive amine release from tissue mast cells.3\" It has been observed that unsequestered zinc ions (4 to 20 mM) are released from mast cell granules during inflammation, suggesting a common linkage between allergies and common colds. 37 Marone et a13s believed that zinc is a competitive antagonist of histamine release from human basophils, and they suggested that zinc compounds might be considered for the treatment of allergic disorders.3s Pasternak3' proposed that cell membrane stabilization by Zn2' was the likely mechanism of action in the treatment of common colds with lozenges releasing positively charged zinc ions.",
