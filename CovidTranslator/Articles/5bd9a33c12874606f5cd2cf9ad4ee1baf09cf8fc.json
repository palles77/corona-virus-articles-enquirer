            "text": "Category A arenaviruses as defined by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) are human pathogens that could be weaponized by bioterrorists. Many of these deadly viruses require biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment for all laboratory work, which limits traditional laboratory high-throughput screening (HTS) for identification of small molecule inhibitors. For those reasons, a related BSL-2 New World arenavirus, Tacaribe virus, 67-78% identical to Jun\u00edn virus at the amino acid level, was used in a HTS campaign where approximately 400,000 small molecule compounds were screened in a Tacaribe virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) assay. Compounds identified in this screen showed antiviral activity and specificity against not only Tacaribe virus, but also the Category A New World arenaviruses (Jun\u00edn, Machupo, and Guanarito). Drug resistant variants were isolated, suggesting that these compounds act through inhibition of a viral protein, the viral glycoprotein (GP2), and not through cellular toxicity mechanisms. A lead compound, ST-294, has been chosen for drug development. This potent and selective compound, with good bioavailability, demonstrated protective anti-viral efficacy in a Tacaribe mouse challenge model. This series of compounds represent a new class of inhibitors that may warrant further development for potential inclusion in a strategic stockpile.",

The S RNA segment encodes the major structural proteins, nucleocapsid protein (NP) and a precursor envelope protein (GPC) encoding two envelope glycoproteins (external GP1 and transmembrane GP2) (Beyer et al., 2003; Froeschke et al., 2003; Kunz et al., 2003; Lenz et al., 2001) , and the L RNA segment encodes the RNA polymerase protein L and an 11 kDa protein, Z protein, with putative regulatory function (Bowen et al., 1996) . GP1 and GP2, which form the tetrameric surface glycoprotein spike, are responsible for virus entry into targeted host cells. The Arenaviridae family has been divided into two groups according to sequence-based phylogeny. The 'Old World' group, endemic in Africa, includes the human pathogens lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus and Lassa virus. The 'New World' group, endemic in Latin America, is divided into three clades. Clade B includes in addition to Tacaribe and Amapari viruses, the Category A human pathogenic viruses Jun\u00edn (Argentine hemorrhagic fever), Machupo (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever), Guanarito (Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever), and Sabi\u00e1 (Brazilian hemorrhagic fever). These Category A viruses are capable of causing severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in humans.",

A number of in vitro inhibitors of arenavirus replication have been reported in the literature (Candurra et al., 1996; Glushakova et al., 1990; Petkevich et al., 1981; Wachsman et al., 2000; Rawls et al., 1976) with modest activity and significant toxicity. Ribavirin is the only compound that has shown partial efficacy against some arenavirus infections, but with a high level of undesirable secondary reactions (Enria and Maiztegui, 1994) . Ribavirin is a nonimmunosuppressive nucleoside analogue with broad antiviral properties (Jahrling, 1997) . Ribavirin has been shown to reduce mortality from Lassa fever in high-risk patients (Jahrling, 1997) . Treatment of viral hemorrhagic fever currently consists primarily of supportive care (Enria and Maiztegui, 1994; Garcia et al., 2000; Leifer et al., 1970) . The only arenavirus hemorrhagic fever for which studies have been undertaken toward development of a vaccine has been Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) caused by Jun\u00edn virus. A live-attenuated vaccine, called Candid 1, has been evaluated in controlled trials among agricultural workers in AHF-endemic areas, where it appeared to reduce the number of reported AHF cases with no serious side effects (Enria et al., 1999) . It is not known if the Candid 1 vaccine would be useful against other arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers. Tacaribe virus is a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) New World arenavirus (NWA) that is found in clade B and phylogenetically related to the Category A NWA (Jun\u00edn, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabi\u00e1) . Tacaribe virus is 67-78% identical to Jun\u00edn virus at the amino acid level for all four viral proteins. In order to screen for inhibitors of NWA a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for virus replication was developed using Tacaribe virus as a surrogate for Category A NWA. A 400,000 small molecule library was screened using this HTS assay. A lead series was chosen based on drug properties and this series was optimized through iterative chemistry resulting in the identity of a highly active and specific small molecule inhibitor of Tacaribe virus with selective activity against human pathogenic NWA (Jun\u00edn, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabi\u00e1). This molecule demonstrates favorable pharmacodynamic properties which permitted the demonstration of in vivo anti-arenavirus activity in a newborn mouse model.",

An enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to evaluate the antiviral effect of compounds against CMV (MRC-5 cells) and LCMV (Vero cells). All of these assays were carried out in the appropriate media containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Ninetysix-well cell culture plates were seeded 24 h before use with 1.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well (Vero), 2.2 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well (HEp-2 and MA104), and 4.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well (MRC-5). For compound susceptibility testing, compounds (solubilized with 100% DMSO) were added to duplicate wells at final concentrations of 50, 15.8, 5, 1.6, 0.5, 0.16, 0.05, 0.016 , and 0 M. The final concentration of DMSO in the assays was 0.5%. Virus stocks were titrated in a separate experiment to determine the concentration that resulted in 90% destruction of the cell monolayer (CPE assay) after 3 days (HSV-1, Rotavirus and vaccinia) or 4 days (SARS-CoV, RSV, Tacaribe virus, Candid 1 vaccine virus and Amapari virus) or the concentration that generated an ELISA signal of 2.5 at an optical density of 650 nm (OD 650 ) after 3 days (LCMV) or 4 days (CMV). These pre-established dilutions of virus (250 pfu for Tacaribe virus) were added to wells containing serial dilutions of compound. Uninfected cells and cells receiving virus without compound were included on each assay plate. In addition, reference agents, when available, were included on each assay plate (gancyclovir for HSV-1 and CMV, Sigma #G2536; ribavirin for LCMV and RSV, Sigma #R9644; rifampicin for vaccinia virus, Sigma #R3501). Plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C and 5% CO 2 for either 3 days (HSV-1, Rotavirus, LCMV, Vaccinia virus) or 4 days (Tacaribe virus, Amapari virus, Candid 1 virus, SARS-CoV, RSV, and CMV). HSV-1, SARS-CoV, Rotavirus, Vaccinia virus, RSV, Tacaribe virus, Amapari virus, Candid 1 vaccine virus infected plates were processed for crystal violet staining while plates infected with CMV and LCMV were processed for ELISA analysis. For crys-tal violet staining, the plates were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. After rinsing and drying, the optical density at 570 nm (OD 570 ) was measured using a Microplate Reader. For ELISA analysis, the medium from the LCMV and CMV-infected plates was removed and the cells were fixed with 100% methanol (Fisher, CAS #67-56-1, HPLC grade) for 20 min at room temperature. The methanol solution was removed and the plates were washed three times with PBS. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by the addition of 130 l of Superblock Blocking Buffer (Pierce #37515) for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. The blocking agent was removed and the wells were washed three times with PBS. Thirty microliters of a 1:20 dilution of LCMV nuclear protein (NP) specific monoclonal antibody (generous gift of Juan Carlos de la Torre, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) or 30 l of a 1:200 dilution of CMV (protein 52 and unique long gene 44 product) specific cocktail monoclonal antibodies (Dako, #M0854) in Superblock Blocking Buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20 was added. Following 1 h incubation at 37 \u2022 C, the primary antibody solution was removed and the wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Forty microliters of goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated monoclonal antibody (Bio-Rad #172-1011) diluted 1:4000 (LCMV) or 1:400 (CMV) in Superblock Blocking Buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20 was added to the wells and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. The secondary antibody solution was removed and the wells were washed five times with PBS. The assay was developed for 15 min by the addition of 130 l of 3,3 ,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma #T0440) to quantify peroxidase activity. The OD 650 of the resulting reaction product was measured using a Molecular Devices Kinetic Microplate Reader with a 650 nm filter. Antiviral activity against Tacaribe virus was evaluated by three methods: CPE assay, plaque reduction, and virus yield inhibition assay. For the HTS CPE assay, Vero cells were plated at 80% confluency on 96-well plates. Test compounds (80 per plate) from the library were added to wells at a final concentration of 5 M. Tacaribe virus was then added at a virus dilution that would result in 90% CPE after 5 days (multiplicity of infection [MOI] approximately 0.001) from a seed stock of 1 \u00d7 10 10 pfu/ml (10% of final volume). Plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C and 5% CO 2 for 5 days, then fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The extent of virus CPE was quantified spectrometrically at OD 570 using an Envision Microplate Reader. The inhibitory activity of each compound was calculated by subtracting from the OD 570 of test compound well from the average OD 570 of virus-infected cell wells, then dividing by the average OD 570 of mock-infected cell wells. The result represents the percent protection against Tacaribe virus CPE activity conferred by each compound. \"Hits\" in this assay were defined as compound that inhibited virus-induced CPE by greater than 50% at the test concentration (5 M). Hits that possessed chemical tractability were further evaluated for their inhibitory potency. The inhibitory concentration 50% (EC 50 ) values were determined from a plot of the compound inhibitory activity following the CPE assay across eight compound concentrations (50, 15, 5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.15, 0.05, and 0.015 M). All determinations were performed in duplicate.",

While no virus was titrated from the dialyzed bag originally incubated with drug, more than 300 pfu of virus was titrated from the DMSO vehicle dialyzed bag (data not shown). No drug was biologically detected in the dialysis bag originally containing 5 M of drug as measured by the incapability of the virus plus drug dialyzed mixture to inhibit freshly added Tacaribe virus (300 pfu). These data suggested that ST-336 binds intact virions with a very slow dissociation constant. In the second experiment (Fig. 3) , Tacaribe virus was incubated in a test tube with 5 M of ST-336 or DMSO. Serial 1:10 dilutions were performed and for some samples ST-336 was added as a specified dilution representing the concentration of drug expected following sample dilution. As virus and compound are diluted with media, the compound concentration will reach a concentration without an inhibitory effect, unless the compound was capable of binding to virus. Test virus without compound in the initial tube was also diluted in media and compound concentrations corresponding to that found in the tubes where virus and compound were diluted together was added to each virus dilution. Titration on Vero cells showed that ST-336 present in excess in the initial tube was carried over for two additional 1:10 dilutions through specific virus binding and inhibits virus infection. Whereas when drug was added at a specified dilution virus was not inhibited to the same degree as virus diluted with drug (data not shown). These data suggest that ST-336 binds with at least a slow K off to intact protein present on Tacaribe virus. ",

Based on the time of addition experiments, it was suspected that the viral glycoproteins might be the target of ST-336. The entire glycoprotein precursor GPC region of the S segment was sequenced. Sequence analysis was performed on four wild type isolates (WT#1-4) and four ST-336 DR isolates derived from drug selection applied to each corresponding parental wild type isolate (DR#1.1 from WT#1, DR#2.1 from WT#2, DR#3.1 from WT#3 and DR#4.1 from WT#4). The sequence analysis showed that the GPC gene from the four parental wild type isolates had identical sequences. When compared to the GPC sequences of four drug resistant variants, each possessed a single nucleotide change that in all cases resulted in an amino acid change. Fig. 4A shows the location of each of the mutations which are located in or around the transmembrane domain of GP2. The sequence alignments of the region of the GP2 containing the changes is presented in Fig. 4B . The single change in DR#1.1 was at amino acid position 418 (I418T), in DR#2.1 at amino acid 416 (T416N), in DR#3.1 at amino acid 433 (S433I) and in DR#4.1 at amino acid 436 (F436I). I418 is similarly conserved (I or L, but never a T) in all clade B New World arenavirus, while T416 is conserved among all clade B NWA. F436 is similarly conserved with one exception; Amapari virus encodes a leucine at position 436. This change in Amapari virus may explain its lack of susceptibility to ST-336. I418, T416, S433 and F436 lie near the N-and C-terminal limits of the putative transmembrane domain of GP2, a region known to play a vital role in enveloped virus fusion (Bagai and Lamb, 1996; Harman et al., 2002; Jeetendra et al., 2003; West et al., 2001; Yao and Compans, 1995) . Taken together, these data suggest that amino acid changes in arenavirus GP2 at either position 416, 418, 433 or 436 are sufficient to confer reduced susceptibility to ST-336 and are consistent with the proposed fusion inhibition mechanism suggested by virological experiments.",

For the Category A agents, the experiments require BSL-4 containment. However, in an effort to obtain an initial readout, a Tacaribe virus challenge model in newborn mice was established. In preparation for this study, PK and tolerability experiments were performed with ST-294 in newborn mice prior to conducting an efficacy trial. Newborn (4-day old) BALB/c mice were dosed IP with 10 mg/kg of ST-294 and blood samples were collected for analysis. Relative to in vitro antiviral concentrations required to inhibit Tacaribe virus CPE (EC 50 = 66 ng/ml), mean plasma concentrations in newborn mice were well above this level for prolonged periods of time (>15\u00d7 through 8 h and 6\u00d7 at 24 h after dosing, data not shown). In this model the drug is delivered via the IP route due to the difficulty of performing multiple oral gavages on newborn mice. To test tolerability, newborn mice were given IP dosages ranging from 0 to 100 mg/kg/day of ST-294 for 5 days. Dosages of 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days were well tolerated by the newborn mice as there were no clinical signs of toxicity and the mice gained weight at the same rate as the control mice (data not shown). This highest tested concentration of ST-294 of 100 mg/kg/day was used in a Tacaribe animal efficacy study. Fig. 6 . Effect of ST-294 in newborn mice challenged with Tacaribe virus.

The addition of the difluoromethoxy group in ST-294 gave this compound increased S9 stability, but did not reduce antiviral activity.",

Ribavirin does not cross the BBB in adult species; however the extent that ribavirin can cross the barrier in newborn mice is unknown. Also the drug levels and half-life of this drug candidate given IP in newborn mice is not as good as oral dosing in rats so serum levels and compound getting to the brain may have compromised the ability to obtain complete protection in this model. The more appropriate animal models for hemorrhagic fever caused by arenaviruses are in guinea pigs and non-human primates where the virus replicates predominantly in the spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow causing hemorrhagic diathesis. Guinea pig models are well established for Jun\u00edn, Machupo, and Guanarito virus diseases, and represent the best small animal model for evaluation during preclinical studies (Hall et al., 1996; Peters et al., 1987) . Guinea pigs infected with pathogenic strains of Jun\u00edn virus develop a fatal disease akin to human AHF (Weissenbacher et al., 1982) .",

For HIV therapy, entry inhibitors have recently raised great interest because of their activity against multi-drug resistant viruses. A new antiviral against HIV was recently approved by the FDA called enfuvirtide. Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) is a potent fusion inhibitor that blocks formation of the six-helix bundle and thus prevents membrane fusion (Kinomoto et al., 2005) . Enfuvirtide has been successful in improving the virological and immunological response in treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients (Oldfield et al., 2005) . There are several other compounds that counter HIV entry that are in different developmental stages, among them: (1) the attachment inhibitor dextrin-2-sulfate; (2) the inhibitors of the glycoprotein (gp) 120/CD4 interaction PRO 542, TNX 355 and BMS 488043; (3) the co-receptor inhibitors subdivided in those targeting CCR5 or CXCR4 (Castagna et al., 2005) . The success of enfuvirtide and others in the development pathway are proof that virus entry inhibitors can be used to treat viral diseases in humans.",

Since virus infection can be completely inhibited at concentrations in the nanomolar range, the target for ST-294 would seem to be both accessible and extremely sensitive to reagents that disrupt its role in the infection process. Therefore, it will be important to further define the mechanism involved in ST-294 mediated inhibition.",
