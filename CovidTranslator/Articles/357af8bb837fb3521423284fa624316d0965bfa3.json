            "text": "Case summary This work describes the diagnosis and successful treatment of a 2-year-old domestic cat infected with Leishmania species and presenting fever, and ulcerative and nodular skin lesions after being treated for pyodermatitis for 1 year without clinical improvement. After anamnesis the cat was submitted to a complete clinical examination. Blood was collected for determination of haematological and biochemical parameters, detection of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and Leishmania amastigotes. Fine-needle aspiration puncture from the skin nodules was also performed. After definitive diagnosis the animal was treated and followed up over a 2 year period. The animal tested negative for FIV-specific antibodies, FeLV antigen and feline coronavirus RNA. Leishmania amastigotes in the skin nodules were confirmed by cytology and molecular diagnosis. Treatment was initiated with allopurinol, resulting in a slight clinical improvement. Thus, N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate was added and administered for 30 days, with complete closure of the ulcerative lesions in the hindlimbs requiring a surgical approach. Close monitoring of the patient in the following 24 months indicated that combined therapy was safe and clinical cure was achieved without further relapses or side effects. Relevance and novel information Considering the increasing number of feline leishmaniosis cases and the inconsistent results of most therapeutic protocols described in the literature, the use of new approaches, especially in refractory cases, is essential. Although the use of allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate is off-label in cats, in this case the combination treatment was followed by an extensive analytical monitoring, supporting their safety and effectiveness.",

            "text": "The occurrence of feline leishmaniosis (FeL) has increased worldwide, revealing a possible role of cats in leishmaniosis epidemiology. Better accuracy of laboratory techniques has improved the diagnosis of this disease, and changes in ecosystems over the last few years associated with the use of repellents on dogs might play a role in sandflies' altered feeding patterns in urban areas, leading to infections in other mammalian hosts. [1] [2] [3] Worldwide epidemiological surveys of Leishmania species causing feline asymptomatic infection and FeL have been reported. 4, 5 In Europe, Spain had the first described FeL case in 1932. 6 Some authors claim that low prevalence of FeL in endemic areas may be related to a natural resistance to the parasite in cats. 7 Moreover, the number of clinical cases may be underestimated, leading to few reports and lack of information by clinicians and owners. Although Portugal is an endemic country for canine leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum, there are few published clinical reports of FeL, with the first description of it in 1994 in Sesimbra, followed by others in Porto and Lisbon. [8] [9] [10] Despite occasional reports of ocular and visceral disease, dermatological, mucocutaneous/mucosal presentations and lymph node enlargement are the most frequent clinical features. [11] [12] [13] [14] Clinical suspicion is based on history, clinical signs and clinicopathological abnormalities. Diagnosis is confirmed with parasitological and serological methods. 15 A long-term administration of allopurinol (10-20 mg/kg q12h or q24h) is the most recommended treatment protocol for FeL, 10, 11, 15 however, similarly to dogs, recurrence can occur if the infection is not cleared. Some authors have reported a good clinical response using N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate monotherapy (5-100 mg/kg or 375 mg/cat q24h SC or IM under different protocols). 8, 15 This study aims to describe the treatment of a recurring clinical case of FeL in a cat receiving combined therapy (allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate).",

About 20-25 skin nodules measuring 2-10 mm in diameter were distributed on the outer pinnal surfaces ( Figure 1a ) and orbital regions (Figure 1b ). Most of them were observed on the pinnae, where they gathered with coalescing patterns. Differential diagnosis was pyodermatitis, allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, neoplastic disease or A complete blood count and biochemical profile were used to evaluate the clinical status of the cat before treatment, after treatment and at all follow-up examinations. Urinalysis and urinary protein: creatinine ratio were evaluated 6 months after treatment. Haematological and biochemical values were within the reference intervals. Serum protein electrophoresis showed an albumin: globulin ratio, but a slight hypergammaglobulinaemia was evident ( Table 1 ).",
