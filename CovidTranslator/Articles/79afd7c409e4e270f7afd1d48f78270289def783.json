To investigate transmission dynamics and then determine control methodology, we took epidemic in Wuhan as a study case. Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, the existing models are based on the common assumption that the total population follows a homogeneous spatial distribution, which is not the case for the prevalence occurred both in the community and in hospital due to the difference in the contact rate. To solve this problem, we propose a novel epidemic model called SEIR-HC, which is a novel epidemic model with two different social circles. Using the model alongside the exclusive optimization algorithm, the spread process of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city is reproduced and then the propagation characteristics and unknown data are estimated. Furthermore, the control measures implemented in Wuhan are assessed and the control methodology of COVID-19 is discussed to provide guidance for limiting the epidemic spread.",

A prime cause is the difficulty in obtaining the reliable data for the required data is patchy, delayed, and even wrong [1, 2, 5, 6] . The second cause is that the epidemic transmission scarcely occurs in the absence of interventions. Life activities and travel, which are tightly linked to the spread of infection, make the case more complex. The last but not least reason is that there are too many incidences, which cannot be ignored anyhow, happened in hospital where the contact rate is entirely different from that in the community. All of those pose difficulties for the general epidemic models to work. Additional problem encountered here is related to optimal estimation of the parameters of the epidemic model [8] .",

In 1866, Farr [12] mathematically described the cattle-plague epidemic by means of curve fitting method. In 1889, P. D. En'ko presented a discrete-time model in which the population consists of infectious individuals and susceptible individuals [13] . In 1906, Hamer [14] proposed that the incidence depends on the product of the densities of the susceptibles and infectives. The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model was formulated by Martini in 1921 [15, 16] . In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick [17] investigated the SIR model in a homogeneous population by using differential equations and discovered that the epidemic course would inevitably be terminated once the density of population becomes smaller than a critical threshold. Stone et al. [18] analyzed the rationale of the pulse vaccination strategy with the SIR model. The SIR model is ideally suited to describe the process of virus spread. However, it is not always congruent with epidemic course. Some infections do not confer any long lasting immunity.",

In this model, the population is divided into four classes of individuals: susceptibles, exposed individuals, infectives and recovered individuals. Such an epidemic model is known as the SEIR model.

In our baseline scenario, we estimate that the outbreak would be over before Apr 15, 2020 , and the total of infectives no longer increases by Mar 15, 2020. At the same time, the total number of removed individuals would reach 111383 finally (as shown in Fig. 7(a) ). Among them, the number of hospital staff members would be up to 2950, which is likely to be slightly more than the reported cases due to asymptomatic infection. The number of the infected individuals in Wuhan on Jan 25, 2020, is estimated to be 46029, which is less than the count 75815 estimated by Wu et al [7] . The number of infectives on Jan 30 is 35962 (2.52% difference to 36880), which is much higher than 20767 (the number of the infected individuals estimated by Nishiura et al [5] ). Number of infectious hospital staff members on Feb 11 is equal to 1241 (11.87% difference to 1022).",

It can be observed from Fig. 10(b) that, as a result of a large number of inbound travellers every day, the accumulative total of the infectives can be even more than permanent resident population.

With the model, the spread process of COVID-19 is reproduced clearly even without enough observation data. The latent period, infectious period and basic reproduction number of COVID-19 are estimated to be 4.19, 12.53 and 7.90, respectively. Obviously, COVID-19 is highly transmissible. The outbreak in Wuhan is anticipated to be over before Apr 15, 2020 . The total number of removed individuals would reach 111383 finally. Among them, the number of hospital staff members would be up to 2950.",
