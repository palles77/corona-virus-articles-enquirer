The historical focus of immigration and international public health has tended to be on contagious diseases of epidemic potential such as trachoma, syphilis, tuberculosis, and, recently, HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). However, there has been a recent shift in attention to the personal health risks associated with immigration and other infectious and non-infectious diseases. Table 19 .2 presents some of the clinical screening issues for healthcare providers working with defined migrant populations. With globalization of economies and trade, rapidity of interregional transportation, and increasing international population mobility for temporary and permanent relocation, healthcare professionals will increasingly need both to recognize imported clinical syndromes and to be sensitive to quiescent conditions of both personal and public health significance when dealing with migrants.",

Increasingly in high-health service regions with low prevalence of any poor health indicators and excellent local public health programs, migrants and other mobile populations are becoming the Continued \"at risk\" populations. Many of the factors impacting on adverse health outcomes in migrants are amenable to screening, and there are effective interventions for health promotion or disease prevention. High-risk populations of migrants, including refugees, workers, adopted children, victims of torture, and trafficked individuals, may require specialized medical care as well as specifically designed screening based on medical and sociological assessment of their needs. Professional healthcare providers, health educational, training, and professional societies, and governments and nongovernmental agencies will be challenged to develop policies and programs to respond to this emerging and dynamic challenge to address the health needs of internationally mobile populations.",
