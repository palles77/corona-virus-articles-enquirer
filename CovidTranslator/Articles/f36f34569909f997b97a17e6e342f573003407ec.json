Here we demonstrate by a battery of morphological and biochemical assays that HCV induces the accumulation of autophagosomes in cells without enhancing autophagic protein degradation. This induction of autophagosomes depended on the unfolded protein response (UPR), as the suppression of UPR signaling pathways suppressed HCV-induced lipidation of the LC3 protein, a necessary step for the formation of autophagosomes. The suppression of UPR or the suppression of expression of LC3 or Atg7, a protein that mediates LC3 lipidation, suppressed HCV replication, indicating a positive role of UPR and the incomplete autophagic response in HCV replication. Conclusion: Our studies delineate the molecular pathway by which HCV induces autophagic vacuoles and also demonstrate the perturbation of the autophagic response by HCV. These unexpected effects of HCV on the host cell likely play an important role in HCV pathogenesis.",

These double-membrane vesicles, also known as autophagosomes, subsequently fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes for the degradation of their contents for recycling (1). Many genes that are important for autophagy have been identified. Among them is LC3 whose covalent linkage to phosphatidylethanolamine by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like protein Atg7 is necessary for the formation of autophagosomes (2).",

In this system, the HCV JFH1 RNA or its derivative was transfected into human hepatoma cells to direct the replication and release of infectious HCV particles, which could then initiate the next round of infection. In this report, we use this HCV RNA transfection/infection system to study HCV-host interactions. Our results indicate that HCV induces the accumulation of autophagosomes by activating UPR. However, HCV does not enhance autophagic protein degradation. Importantly, this induction of autophagosomes enhanced HCV replication. The persistent induction of the UPR and the perturbation of the autophagic response likely play an important role in HCV pathogenesis.",

The GND mutant RNA served as a negative control, as it cannot replicate and is rapidly degraded in transfected cells. By performing electron microscopy, we found that HCV JFH1 induced the accumulation of membrane vesicles with the morphology of autophagosomes ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ), which were rarely observed in GND RNA transfected cells ( Supplementary Fig. 1B ). To investigate whether HCV could indeed induce the accumulation of autophagosomes, we established stable Huh7.5 cells that expressed the GFP-LC3 fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 1 , cells transfected by the GND RNA displayed no detectable HCV core protein signal and in general a weak and diffused cytoplasmic signal of the GFP-LC3 fusion protein (panel a). In contrast, most of the cells transfected by the JFH1 RNA stained strongly for the HCV core protein with most of them (approximately 80% at day 5 post-transfection) also displaying bright and punctuate GFP-LC3 signal (panel b). At a higher magnification, many of the core protein signals were often found to be circular, which is consistent with previous reports that the core protein is associated with lipid droplets. Importantly, the GFP-LC3 signals were also often found to be circular, consistent with their localization on autophagosomal membranes (panel c). Circular GFP-LC3 signals were also observed when JFH1 cells were stained for the HCV NS5A protein ( Supplementary  Fig. 2 ).",

As shown in Fig. 2A , although little LC3-II could be detected in mock transfected cells or cells transfected with the GND mutant RNA, a significant amount of LC3-II was detected in cells transfected with the JFH1 RNA. The ability of HCV to induce the lipidation of LC3 is not limited to the HCV JFH1 isolate, as shown in Fig. 2B , a similar result was observed in Huh7 cells harboring a high replication level of the subgenomic HCV RNA replicon derived from the genotype 1b Con-1 virus (10).",

To investigate whether HCV could also enhance autophagic protein degradation, we analyzed the degradation rate of long-lived proteins in cells. Huh7.5 cells were metabolically labeled with 3 H-leucine for twenty-four hours followed by the chase of another twenty-four hours to allow the degradation of labeled, short-lived proteins. Cells were then rinsed and incubated in fresh media in the presence and absence of bafilomycin A1 (BAF), a vacuolar ATPase inhibitor that suppresses the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes (13) . The protein degradation rate was determined by measuring the amount of TCA-soluble radiolabel released into the medium per hour. The overall protein degradation rates and those sensitive to BAF and hence mediated by autophagy are shown in Fig. 3A and 3B, respectively. As shown in the figures, nutrient starvation, which induces autophagy and served as the positive control, increased both overall and BAF-sensitive protein degradation rates. Interestingly, HCV JFH1 did not increase, but rather slightly reduced, overall and BAF-sensitive protein degradation rates. These results suggested that, although HCV JFH1 was able to enhance the accumulation of autophagosomes, it did not enhance autophagic protein degradation. To further confirm this observation, we analyzed the p62/SQSTM1 protein level in cells. The p62/ SQSTM1 protein binds to LC3 and is degraded by autophagy (14) . As shown in Fig. 3C , there was a continuous increase, albeit small, of the p62/SQSTM1 protein level in cells during the first 24 hours after the transfection of the HCV RNA. In contrast, nutrient starvation reduced the p62 level by approximately 65%. These results again indicated that HCV JFH1 did not enhance autophagic protein degradation.",

Bright GFP puncta (i.e., autophagic vacuoles) were detected in a large fraction of cells that were nutrientstarved (Fig. 4) . Nearly half (colocalization coefficient 0.43) of these GFP puncta were also positive for LysoTracker-red. In contrast, when HCV cells were also analyzed, the fraction of GFP-LC3 puncta that was also positive for LysoTracker-red was significantly lower with a colocalization coefficient of only 0.14 (p<0.005).

Since ER stress has been shown to induce autophagy (19, 20) , we decided to investigate whether HCV could induce the accumulation of autophagosomes via the induction of ER stress. We first examined whether HCV could induce ER stress during productive replication. ER stress, which is caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, can activate the UPR via three different sensors: PERK, ATF6 and IRE1 (21) . As shown in Fig. 5A , HCV induced the phosphorylation of PERK and its downstream effector eIF2\u03b1, which in turn led to the increased expression of ATF4, CHOP/GADD153 and the protein chaperon GRP78. We then examined the effect of HCV on IRE1, which, upon its activation, induces the splicing of the xbp1 mRNA to stimulate the expression of UPR target genes (21) . Splicing of xbp1 mRNA was assayed by RT-PCR: the unspliced RNA generates a 442-bp product that can be digested by the restriction enzyme Pst1, whereas the spliced RNA generates a 416-bp Pst1-resistant product (22) . As shown in Fig. 5B , the spliced xbp1 RNA was easily detectable in cells transfected with the JFH1 RNA but not in cells transfected with the GND RNA or in untransfected cells. As a positive control, we treated na\u00efve Huh7.5 cells with DTT, a chemical that causes protein misfolding and ER stress (22) . As expected, this treatment induced the splicing of xbp1 mRNA in Huh7.5 cells (Fig. 5B) .",

These observations indicated that ER stress could induce autophagy in Huh7.5 cells. To test whether HCV JFH1 indeed induced the accumulation of autophagosomes via the induction of ER stress, we treated HCV JFH1 cells with siRNAs directed against PERK, IRE1 and ATF6. As shown in Fig. 7A , two different siRNAs directed against PERK reduced significantly the PERK protein level in HCV JFH1 cells. In contrast, a control siRNA had no effect on the total PERK protein level. The suppression of PERK function by the siRNAs was confirmed by the observation that the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, a substrate of PERK, was reduced by PERK siRNAs (Fig. 7A) . Neither the control siRNA nor the PERK-specific siRNAs affected the total eIF2\u03b1 protein level in HCV JFH1 cells. We then examined whether the suppression of PERK expression by siRNA would affect the lipidation of LC3 by HCV. As shown in Fig. 7A , while the LC3-II level was not affected by the control siRNA, it was significantly reduced by the PERK siRNAs. These results indicated a critical role of PERK in the autophagic response induced by HCV.",

As shown in Fig. 8A , the siRNAs directed against PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 reduced the HCV RNA level by approximately 80%, 98% and 80%, respectively, as compared with HCV RNA levels in cells treated with the control siRNA. These results indicated that ER stress and likely also autophagosomes played a positive role in HCV RNA replication. To confirm the role of the autophagosomes in HCV RNA replication, we conducted additional knockdown experiments using siRNAs directed against LC3 and Atg7. The LC3 siRNA reduced both LC3-I and LC3-II protein levels, whereas the Atg7 siRNA reduced the Atg7 protein level and the LC3-II level (Fig. 8B) . The LC3 siRNA and the Atg7 siRNA also reduced the HCV RNA level by approximately 70% and 55% in JFH1 cells (Fig.  8A) , confirming a positive role of autophagosomes or the pathway leading to its accumulation in HCV RNA replication.",

Our results demonstrated that HCV also induces the accumulation of autophagosomes in its host cells ( Fig.  1 and 2) . The ability of HCV to induce autophagosomes is not limited to the genotype 2a HCV JFH1 strain, as this induction was also observed in Huh7 cells harboring the genotype 1b Con-1 virus subgenomic RNA replicon (Fig. 2B) . While this manuscript was in preparation, it was also reported that the HCV genotype 1a virus could induce the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (24) . Thus, the ability of HCV to induce autophagosomes is shared by HCV strains across different genotypes. Interestingly, however, although HCV JFH1 was able to induce autophagosomes, it was not able to enhance autophagic protein degradation (Fig. 3) . This lack of enhancement of autophagic degradation by HCV is apparently due to the inefficient fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 4) .",

Our results demonstrated that HCV induced the accumulation of autophagosomes via the induction of ER stress ( Fig. 5 and  6 ). This induction of autophagosomes involved all three arms of the UPR (Fig. 7) , as the suppression of any of these three pathways suppressed the lipidation of LC3, an essential step for the formation of autophagosomes. This observation is interesting, as it indicated that the target genes activated by these different signaling pathways must work in concert with one another to induce autophagy. ER stress can enhance autophagy in Huh7.5 cells (Fig. 6) . However, the autophagy activated by HCV is incomplete, as autophagic degradation is not increased (Fig. 3) . It is likely that HCV factors and/or other signaling pathways activated by HCV perturb the maturation of autophagic vacuoles (Fig. 4) .",

Thus, our results indicated that ER stress and the autophagic pathway play a positive role in HCV replication. It does not appear likely that HCV uses autophagosomes as sites for virion morphogenesis, as the HCV core protein and autophagosomes do not colocalize (Fig. 1B) .
