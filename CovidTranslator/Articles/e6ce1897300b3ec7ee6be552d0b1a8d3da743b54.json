            "text": "Despite the availability of numerous gene fusion systems, recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli remains difficult. Establishing the best fusion partner for difficult-to-express proteins remains empirical. To determine which fusion tags are best suited for difficult-to-express proteins, a comparative analysis of the newly described SUMO fusion system with a variety of commonly used fusion systems was completed. For this study, three model proteins, enhanced green florescent protein (eGFP), matrix metalloprotease-13 (MMP13), and myostatin (growth differentiating factor-8, GDF8), were fused to the C termini of maltose-binding protein (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), thioredoxin (TRX), NUS A, ubiquitin (Ub), and SUMO tags. These constructs were expressed in E. coli and evaluated for expression and solubility. As expected, the fusion tags varied in their ability to produce tractable quantities of soluble eGFP, MMP13, and GDF8. SUMO and NUS A fusions enhanced expression and solubility of recombinant proteins most dramatically. The ease at which SUMO and NUS A fusion tags were removed from their partner proteins was then determined. SUMO fusions are cleaved by the natural SUMO protease, while an AcTEV protease site had to be engineered between NUS A and its partner protein. A kinetic analysis showed that the SUMO and AcTEV proteases had similar K M values, but SUMO protease had a 25-fold higher k cat than AcTEV protease, indicating a more catalytically efficient enzyme. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SUMO is superior to commonly used fusion tags in enhancing expression and solubility with the distinction of generating recombinant protein with native sequences.",

            "text": "The lack of efficient methods to express structurally diverse proteins in Escherichia coli is a major obstacle in structural genomics. In fact, the Southeast Collaboratory for Structural Genomics (SECSG) reports that only 22.9% of proteins they have expressed in E. coli have been soluble (1463 soluble proteins of 6397 expressed; as published on the SECSG Web site 08/11/2005). Numerous technological advancements have vastly improved recombinant protein expression in E. coli, including the development of strong promoters (Studier and Moffatt 1986) , coexpression with chaperones and foldases (Ikura et al. 2002) , and the use of protein fusions. Protein fusions have been particularly successful at enhancing the expression and solubility of recombinant proteins. Fusion systems are characterized by their ability to enhance protein expression, reduce proteolytic degradation of the recombinant protein, improve protein folding, solubility, and simplify purification and detection. A variety of structures have been used as fusion motifs, including maltose-binding protein (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), thioredoxin (TRX), NUS A, ubiquitin (UB), and SUMO (Table 1 ; Pryor and Leiting 1997; Wang et al. 1999; De Marco et al. 2004 ). There is nothing in common among these fusion proteins in terms of molecular weight, structure, or function, with the exception of Ub and SUMO, which share a common structure (Bayer et al. 1998 ). As such, predicting which fusion tag will enhance the solubility of a difficult-to-express protein remains empirical. Some comparison studies have been completed; however, none have examined the ability of the newly described SUMO fusion system to enhance expression and solubility in comparison to other commonly used tags (Davis et al. 1999; Wang et al. 1999; De Marco et al. 2004) . SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) , an ,100residue protein, modulates protein structure and function by covalent modification of target proteins in eukaryotes (Johnson and Blobel 1999; Melchior 2000; Tatham et al. 2001) . The SUMO pathway is highly conserved in eukaryotes and notably absent in prokaryotes. Yeast has a single SUMO gene (SMT3), while three genes have been described in vertebrates (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3) (Kawabe et al. 2000) . The three human SUMOs are highly homologous, with human SUMO-1 sharing 50% sequence identity with human SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 (Muller et al. 1998) , and human SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 sharing 87% sequence identity with each other (Melchior 2000) . SUMO shares 47% sequence identity with human SUMO-1. Although the overall sequence identity between SUMOs and Ub is ,18%, structure determination reveals that they share a common three-dimensional structure that is characterized by a tightly packed globular fold with b-sheets wrapped around one a-helix (Bayer et al. 1998) .",

The enzymes involved in cleaving SUMO fusions, the SUMO proteases, have been extensively studied. Hochstrasser and Li demonstrated that the yeast SUMO proteases, Ulp1 and Ulp2, remove SUMO from proteins and play a role in progression through the G 2 /M phase and recovery of cells from check point arrest, respectively Hochstrasser 1999, 2000) . Ulp1 and Ulp2 cleave the C-termini of SUMO (-GGATY) to form a mature SUMO (-GG) and also deconjugate it from the side chains of lysines within modified proteins. The sequence similarity of the two enzymes is restricted to a 200-amino-acid sequence called ULP domain that contains the catalytically active region. The three-dimensional structure of the ULP domain from Ulp1 has been determined in a binary complex with SUMO (Mossessova and Lima 2000) . It is interesting to note that SUMO proteases are not related to the deubiquinating enzymes (DUBs), but are distantly related to adenoviral processing protease Hochstrasser 1999, 2000) .",

            "text": "One distinguishing feature of the SUMO fusion system is the ability of its associated SUMO protease to cleave a variety of fusion partners with remarkable fidelity and efficiency (Malakhov et al. 2004) . Traditional gene fusion systems require engineered cleavage sites, which are recognized by the proteases and are positioned between the fusion tag and the protein target. Proteases that have been used to cleave fusion tags include tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (Carrington et al. 1989 ), factor Xa, or thrombin protease (Jenny et al. 2003) . A major drawback to the use of engineered cleavage sites and traditional proteases is the generation of non-native N-terminal amino acids. Many structural and therapeutic proteins require specific N-terminal amino acids for biological activity (e.g., chemokines). Cleavage by traditional proteases results in the retention of several amino acids, which are downstream from the cleavage site and required for protease recognition. For example, thrombin will cleave the sequence LVPRGS at the arginine residue, resulting in an N-terminal extension of the target protein by two amino acids (GS) (Jenny et al. 2003) . Those proteins that require a specific N terminus for biological activity, half-life, or structural stability, will not be successfully expressed using gene fusions with traditional proteases. However, direct fusion of the recombinant protein to the C terminus of SUMO results in the production of protein with the desired N-terminal amino acid. In addition, when using traditional gene fusion systems, if the target protein or fusion tag contains the cleavage recognition sequence, the target protein will also be cleaved (e.g., erroneous cleavage of the NUS A tag has been observed when using Factor Xa) (Davis et al. 1999) . The SUMO protease recognizes the tertiary structure of SUMO, and as such, does not cleave erroneously within the target protein.",

The kinetic parameters K M and k cat for AcTEV and SUMO protease were determined using the NUS A-eGFP and SUMO-eGFP substrates, respectively ( Table 2 ). The generated data were fit to the Michaelis-Menton equation using nonlinear regression (R 2 values were equal to 0.97 and 0.99 for the SUMO protease and AcTEV plots, respectively) (Fig. 4) . The apparent K M of AcTEV for the NUS A-eGFP fusion (6.3 mM) is very similar to that of SUMO protease for the SUMO-eGFP fusion (3.3 mM), but its k cat (0.028 sec -1 ) is ,25-fold less than that of SUMO protease (0.782 sec -1 ), resulting in an enzyme with ,25 times lower catalytic efficiency. The K M and k cat values obtained for AcTEV are not similar to what has been previously reported (Nallamsetty et al. 2004 ). This is most likely due to the choice of substrates, as previous studies have been completed using peptide substrates with canonical recognition sites. The SUMO protease does not recognize a linear sequence like AcTEV, and as such, a full fusion construct had to be utilized for comparison purposes. It is expected that lower K M and higher k cat values would be obtained for the peptide substrate than for the full fusion construct. ",

GDF8 was chosen, as recombinant expression in E. coli would greatly facilitate research efforts aimed at exploiting this potentially useful therapeutic target. Previous attempts to express GDF8 in E. coli have been hampered by poor yields, solubility, and lack of biological activity, and therefore, GDF8 is considered to be a difficult-to-express protein (Thomas et al. 2000; Taylor et al. 2001) . Similarly, MMP13 is generally considered a potential therapeutic target and a difficultto-express protein (Pathak et al. 1998; Hardern et al. 2000) . Although only a limited number of proteins were assayed for this study, patterns do emerge as to which tags are best for enhanced expression and solubility, especially for the difficult-to-express proteins used. In general, His 6 tag afforded little to no enhanced expression. MBP was also observed to have little impact on expression, and did not enhance expression at all for the difficult-to-express proteins in this study (MMP13 and GDF8). Both the Ub and GST tags did provide mild enhancement of expression; however, the recombinant protein was mostly contained within the inclusion bodies.

SUMO and Ub have highly homologous, rapidly folding structures (Khorasanizadeh et al. 1996) . It may be that the tight, rapidly folding soluble structure of SUMO provides a nucleation site for the proper folding of C-terminally fused partner proteins. Indeed, expression of alternative configurations of the fusion (i.e., eGFP-SUMO) was not enhanced in E. coli (data not shown). The 55-kDa NUS A fusion tag also facilitates solubility of partner proteins. NUS A, a hydrophilic tag, was identified in a screen for E. coli proteins that have the highest potential for solubility when overexpressed (Davis et al. 1999) . Protein expression levels are dependent on the stability of their mRNA, where degradation plays an important role controlling the levels of unstable transcripts (Arechaga et al. 2003) .",

In the present study, the best tags for enhanced expression and solubility (SUMO and NUS A) were further examined for the ease at which they are removed by their respective proteases (SUMO and AcTEV). Both AcTEV and SUMO proteases had similar affinities to their substrates. However, they differed dramatically in terms of catalytic efficiency (k cat ), with SUMO protease being ,25 times more efficient than AcTEV. In addition to being more catalytically efficient, SUMO protease also has the advantage of recognizing the tertiary structure of SUMO and not a linear amino acid sequence like AcTEV. This characteristic prevents the SUMO protease from erroneously cleaving within the target protein, and thus, SUMO protease behaves as a universal protease, suitable for nearly every substrate. In addition, direct fusion of the target protein to SUMO allows for the generation of recombinant protein with native N-terminal sequences. Taken together, these data suggest that the SUMO fusion system may be ideal for the soluble expression of proteins that have been impossible using traditional gene fusions.",
