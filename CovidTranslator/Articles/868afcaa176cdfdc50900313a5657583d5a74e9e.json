The genome of PorCoV HKU15 OH1987 comprised 25,422 nt (GenBank accession no. KJ462462). The genome organization and the transcription regulatory sequence motif 5\u2032-ACACCA-3\u2032 of PorCoV HKU15 OH1987 are the same as those reported for PorCoV HKU15-155 (1) . Similar to the BLAST search results of partial N and M fragments, the BLAST search of the whole genome of the PorCoV HKU15 OH1987 showed 99% nt identity to PorCoV HKU15-155. BLAST search of the spike gene of PorCoV HKU15 OH1987 showed 99% nt identity to PorCoV HKU15-44. These results confirmed that the coronavirus detected was a deltacoronavirus.",

In addition, the phylogenetic trees constructed by using the amino acid sequences of the spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein showed that the OH1987 virus clustered with HKU15-155 and HKU15-44 ( Figure 2 ); this finding is in agreement with that in a previous study (1) . The OH1987 virus differs from HKU15-155 in the spike gene at nt 19469 and in the noncoding region at nt 25044; a 3-nt insertion is present at each location, making the whole-genome sequence of the OH1987 virus 6 nt longer than that of HKU15-155. The 2 insertion sites of the virus are identical to those of the HKU15-44 strain of porcine deltacoronavirus. However, the genome of OH1987 virus is 1 nt longer than that of HKU15-44 because of the insertion site at nt 25263, located in 3\u2032 untranslated region. Of interest, strain OH1987 was most closely related to HKU15-155 when whole-genome sequence was used for phylogenetic analysis ( Figure  1 ), but strain OH1987 was more closely related to HKU15-44 when phylogenetic analysis of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein was performed ( Figure 2 ). On basis of the partial genome sequence, strain OH1987 was also closely related to a deltacoronavirus found in the Asian leopard cat (the whole-genome sequence is not available in GenBank).",

Further investigation is needed to determine whether infection with PorCoV HKU15 results in disease in pigs and if the virus was responsible for the clinical disease observed in outbreaks on the 5 Ohio farms in this study. In addition, surveillance should be conducted in other US states to define the distribution of the virus among the US pig population. Moreover, whole-genome sequence analysis should be performed for other strains from different locations to determine whether the virus was introduced into the United States by a single entry or by multiple entries.
