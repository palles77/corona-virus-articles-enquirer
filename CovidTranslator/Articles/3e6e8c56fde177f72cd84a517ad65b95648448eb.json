The calves were killed and autopsies performed 7 days after the first virus challenge. The BRSV isolate used induced tracheitis, bronchitis and atelectasis in infected calves. The only virus which could be isolated from the lungs of the calves was BRSV. In addition, Mycoplasma bovirhinis was isolated from the lungs or/and trachea of two calves. The clinical and histopathological findings, as well as the detection of BRSV antigens by immunofluorescence in the epithelial cells of lung and trachea, and the reisolation of the virus from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of all inoculated calves, provided confirmation of successful infection with BRSV.",

            "text": "Laboratory animals, which have been used extensively to study the pathogenesis and immunopathogenesis of RSV infections, have certain disadvantages. Firstly, they are not naturally infected by RSV, therefore the cotton rat model of HRSV infection does not produce clinical signs [13] . Secondly, there is a large variation in the results, i.e. between ferrets and cotton rats [14, 15] . Furthermore, the laboratory animals do not allow the introduction of methods of lung function testing in vivo, Because of the similarities between HRSV and BRSV and their respective diseases, cattle are the best natural host model available for studying the pathogenic mechanisms of RSV infections. Also, the BRSV infection in calves is thought to be a more appropriate model for human RSV infection of children than human RSV infection of laboratory animals because calves, as well as human infants, may become infected by RSV even in the presence of passively derived antibodies. Moreover, the calf model allows extensive lung function studies in vivo, which are currently under way. In most cases a combined intranasal/ intratracheal infection route was successful in producing respiratory tract disease and lesions [16, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, an appropriate validation of the effects of such severe artificial infections is difficult, because it may reflect little of what occurs under natural conditions. The spread of HRSV may occur by close contact with direct inoculation of large droplets or by self-inoculation after touching contaminated surfaces, but the infection did not occur if the particles had to travel distances of 2 or more metres [22] .",

The BRSV titer was determined in a titration assay with immuno enzymatical detection. Briefly, 87 104 BT cells in 100/~1 of medium were seeded into the wells of a 96 well tissue culture plate. The appropriately diluted virus suspensions in medium (100 #1) were added.

            "text": "The gross and histopathological changes of calf No. 1 which had been infected with BRSV 375 without animal passage were restricted to the lower respiratory tract and resemble the typical picture of BRSV infection. Two previous studies of experimental BRSV infections in which a combination of exposure routes (intranasal and intratracheal) was used led to similar results [17, 19] . The observation that areas of lobular consolidation were found in all lung lobes was in agreement with the observation of others [16] . However, the virus exposure did not produce extensive areas of lobular consolidation and such pneumonic proportions of the total pulmonary surface area as described in previous studies [16, 19] . Emphysema and edema have also been described in field reports and in experimental BRSV infections [16, 17, 19] but were not observed in the present investigation. On the other hand, severe bronchitis and tracheitis were common findings in all calves infected with the reisolated virus. This indicates that reisolated BRSV was capable of inducing tracheitis. The reason for this variation in pathological lesions seems to be the restoration of pathogenicity of the reisolated virus due to animal passage. The presence of passive antibodies failed to prevent infection and disease caused by BRSV [19] . In the present study all calves possessed serum antibodies to BRSV prior to experimental infection. In comparison with results in a previous report [33], the frequency of virus recovery obtained after inoculation of BAL fluid specimens into BT cells was very high. These results lead to the conclusion that colostrum feeding did not influence the possibility of reisolating BRSV. The studies of Belknap et al. [16] have demonstrated similar results in calves. In contradiction to the findings of others [18] , in our study an increase of antibody titres was not observed.",

            "text": "Viruses other than BRSV were not identified in any of the calves by viral isolation or HA testing. The need for microbiological examination of the respiratory tract was underlined by the isolation of bacteria. Pasteurella spp. were detected only in nasal swabs and not in the lower respiratory tract. This reflects that, in spite of the adverse effects caused by the aerosol infection, Pasteurellas were not able to spread to the lower respiratory tract. The isolation of Mycoplasma bovirhinis in nearly all nasal swabs of calves was not surprising. In a recent study the ubiquitous M. bovirhinis was isolated from nasal swabs of 23 out of 35 (66%) healthy calves [34] . Secondary infections with M. bovirhinis were observed in calves No. 1 (lung and trachea) and 5 (trachea), but electron microscopic and histological examinations did not reveal lesions typical of mycoplasmal pneumonia in our study. The detection of BRSV by immunofluorescence test in bronchiolar epithelium and in a few alveolar cells, as well as in cellular debris within the lumina of the pulmonary airways, the isolation of the virus from the BAL fluids of all calves and the gross and histological findings indicate that the disease in the experimentally infected calves was produced by BRSV alone. Based on the obtained data, the described model of an artificial RSV infection is suitable for further investigations. Thus, this model can be used to clarify pathogenetic aspects of the RSV infection including changes in lung function and mechanisms of airway responsiveness. Furthermore, on the basis of this model new vaccines and immunization schemes can be studied in the future.",
