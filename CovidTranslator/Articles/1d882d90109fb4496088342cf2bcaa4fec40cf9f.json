However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, postkala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: >85% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were <300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were <4 months for 90% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL.",

VL, also known as 17 kala-azar, is a lethal sandfly-borne parasitic disease targeted 18 for elimination as a public health problem (<1 case/10,000 19 people/year at subdistrict/district level depending on the 20 country) in the Indian subcontinent (ISC) by 2020 (9). PKDL 21 is a non-lethal skin condition that occurs after treatment 22 for VL in 5-20% of cases in the ISC, and less frequently in 23 individuals who report no history of prior VL (8, 10). It is 24 characterised by skin lesions of di ering severity and parasite 25 load, ranging from macules and papules (least severe, lowest 26 load) to nodules (most severe, highest load) (11). We estimate 27 the relative contributions of di erent disease states (VL, PKDL 28 and asymptomatic infection) to transmission, and quantify the 29 rate of spread of infection around infected individuals in space 30 and time by reconstructing transmission trees.

PKDL has therefore been recognised as a major 49 potential threat to the VL elimination programme in the ISC 50 (10), which has led to increased active PKDL case detection. 51 Nevertheless, the contribution of PKDL to transmission in 52 field settings still urgently needs to be quantified. 53 Although the incidence of asymptomatic infection is 4 to 54 17 times higher than that of symptomatic infection in the 55 ISC (21), the extent to which asymptomatic individuals con- (Fig. 1A) .

We assess the contribution of di erent infectious 172 groups to transmission in terms of their relative contribu-173 tion to the transmission experienced by susceptible individuals 174 ( Fig. 2A and Fig. S17 ). The contribution of VL cases was 175 fairly stable at around 75% from 2002 to the end of 2004 176 before decreasing steadily to 0 at the end of the epidemic, 177 while the contribution of PKDL cases increased from 0 in 178 2002 to \u226573% in 2010 (95% CI: 63, 80%) (Fig. S17) . Only a 179 small proportion of the total infection pressure on susceptible 180 individuals, varying between 9% and 14% over the course of 181 the epidemic, was estimated to have come from asymptomatic 182 and pre-symptomatic individuals. Reconstructing the Transmission Tree. By sampling 1,000 193 transmission trees from the joint posterior distribution of 194 the transmission parameters and the unobserved data (as de-195 scribed in Materials and Methods), we can build a picture of 196 the most likely source of infection for each case and how infec-197 tion spread in space and time. Fig. 3 shows the transmission 198 tree at di erent points in time in part of the south-east cluster 199 of villages. Early in the epidemic and at its peak (Figures 3A 200 and 3B), most new infections were due to VL cases. Towards 201 the end of the epidemic, some infections were most likely due 202 to PKDL cases and there was some saturation of infection 203 around VL cases (Fig. 3C) . The inferred patterns of trans-204 mission suggest that disease did not spread radially outward 205 from index cases over time, but instead made a combination 206 of short and long jumps around cases with long durations of 207 symptoms and households with multiple cases. . Arrows show the most likely source of infection for each case infected up to that point in time over 1,000 sampled transmission trees, and are coloured by the type of infection source and shaded according to the proportion of trees in which that individual was the most likely infector (darker shading indicating a higher proportion). Asymptomatic infections are not shown for clarity. S/A = susceptible or asymptomatic, E = pre-symptomatic, I = VL, R = recovered, D = dormantly infected, P = PKDL (see SI Text).

In 370 reality, asymptomatic individuals do not mix homogeneously 371 with susceptible individuals as they are generally clustered 372 together around or near to VL cases (25, 28), who are much 373 more infectious and therefore more likely to infect suscepti-374 ble individuals around them, even if they are outnumbered 375 by asymptomatic individuals. Asymptomatic infection also 376 leads to immunity, and therefore local depletion of suscep-377 tible individuals around infectious individuals. Hence, for 378 the same relative infectiousness, the contribution of asymp-379 tomatic individuals to transmission is much lower when spatial 380 heterogeneity is taken into account.",

Superficially, this appears to conflict 386 with preliminary results of xenodiagnosis studies in which 387 asymptomatic individuals have failed to infect sandflies ac-388 cording to microscopy (44). However, historical (12, 45) and 389 experimental (46) data show that provision of a second blood 390 meal and optimal timing of sand fly examination are criti-391 cal to maximizing sensitivity of xenodiagnosis. These data 392 suggest that recent xenodiagnosis studies (11, 44), in which 393 dissection occurred within 5 days of a single blood meal, may 394 underestimate the potential infectiousness of symptomatic 395 and asymptomatic infected individuals. Occurrence of VL in 396 isolated regions where there are asymptomatically infected 397 individuals, but virtually no reported VL cases (27, 47), also 398 seems to suggest that asymptomatic individuals can generate 399 VL cases. However, it is possible that some individuals who de-400 veloped VL during the study went undiagnosed and untreated, 401 and that we have inferred transmissions from asymptomatic 402 individuals in locations where cases were missed. We will in-403 vestigate the potential role of under-reporting in future work. 404",

            "text": "56 tribute to transmission is still unknown (22, 23). What is 57 clear is that asymptomatic infection plays a role in transmis-58 sion through generating herd immunity, since a significant 59 proportion of asymptomatically infected individuals develop 60 protective cell-mediated immunity against VL following infec-61 tion, as measured by positivity on the leishmanin skin test 62 (LST) (24-27). Several studies have shown that asymptomatic 63 infection is spatiotemporally clustered (25, 28), and therefore 64 immunity is also likely to be spatially clustered, but so far no 65 transmission models have accounted for this (23). Since most 66 surveillance data and data from epidemiological studies does 67 not contain information about numbers of asymptomatically 68 infected individuals over space and time (e.g. from longitudinal 69 serological testing), accounting for the role of asymptomatic 70 infection in transmission at the individual level represents a 71 substantial missing data problem. The endemic nature of the 72 disease and high asymptomatic infection potential mean that 73 it is necessary to infer initial infection statuses for individuals 74 without symptomatic disease, unlike for many epidemic dis-75 eases where individuals can be assumed to be susceptible or 76 are known to have been vaccinated. Coupled with the long and 77 variable incubation period of VL (lasting anywhere between 78 weeks and years but typically 2-6 months (29, 30)) and lack 79 of data on the flight range of the P. argentipes sandfly vector, 80 these factors make inference of spatiotemporal transmission 81 of VL particularly challenging. 82 By combining data from a recent xenodiagnosis study in 83 Bangladesh (11) with the geo-located data on incidence and 84 duration of symptoms of VL and di erent forms of PKDL 85 from the community study in Bangladesh, and fitting it to 86 an individual-level spatiotemporal VL transmission model, 87 this study provides the first detailed insight into the changing 88 roles of VL, PKDL, asymptomatic infection and immunity 89 in transmission over the course of an epidemic, and the first 90 estimates of numbers of secondary cases and infections gen-91 erated by individual VL and PKDL cases.

We estimated the parameters in the 492 transmission model, \u25ca = (-, -, ', \", p), the unobserved infection 493 times of VL cases and infection and recovery times of asymp-494 tomatic individuals, and individuals' unobserved initial statuses 495 by sampling from the joint posterior distribution of \u25ca and the 496 missing data X given the observed data Y (months of birth, mi-497 gration, and death; VL and PKDL onset and recovery times; etc.), 498 P(\u25ca, X|Y) \u00c3 L(\u25ca; Y, X)P(\u25ca), where L(\u25ca; Y, X) denotes the com-499 plete data likelihood and P(\u25ca) is the prior distribution for \u25ca, using a 500 Bayesian data augmentation framework (see SI Text for full details). 501 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used to obtain 502 the joint posterior distribution by iteratively sampling from the 503 posterior distribution of the parameters given the observed data 504 and current value of the missing data, P(\u25ca|Y, X), and the poste-505 rior distribution of the missing data given the observed data and 506 the current values of the parameters, P(X|Y, \u25ca) (52). Relatively 507 uninformative Gamma distributions were used for the priors for the 508 transmission parameters (-, -, ' and \"), and a relatively informative 509 conjugate Beta prior was used for the incubation period distribution 510 parameter p based on a previous estimate of the mean incubation 511 period and its uncertainty (30) (see SI Text for further details). 512 Once the posterior distribution of the parameters and missing 513 data had been obtained from the MCMC, 1,000 samples were 514 drawn from the posterior distribution and the posterior predictive 515 distributions of infection sources for all infectees derived for each 516 sample. These were used to draw an infector for each infectee to 517 reconstruct the transmission tree. Thus we obtained a set of 1,000 518 possible transmission trees that accounted for uncertainty in the 519 parameter values, infection times, infection sources and individuals' 520 initial statuses. The mean distance from each infector to their 521 infectees and time from their onset to the infections of their infectees 522 was calculated for each tree, and then averaged over all trees in 523 which that individual was an infector to obtain distributions of mean 524 distances and times to infectees across all infectors (Figures 4A and 525 4B). The posterior predictive distributions of infection sources were 526 also used to estimate the number of secondary infections for each 527 asymptomatic individual, VL case and PKDL case (Figures 4C, S18 528 and S19B), and the time-dependent e ective reproduction number 529 (Fig. S19C).530 Model Simulations. We implemented a simulation version of the 531 transmission model (full details in SI Text) to assess the ability of 532 the model to reproduce the observed data and to investigate the 533 counterfactual impact of di erent hypothetical interventions against 534 PKDL on VL incidence. One hundred samples of the parameters 535 and individuals' infection statuses in December 2002 were drawn 536 from the posterior distribution obtained from the MCMC and 100 537 simulations of the model run for each sample starting from January 538 2003 (at which point all but one of the paras had had at least 539 1 VL case since January 2002), to give 10,000 realisations of the 540 epidemic under \"normal\" interventions. This process was then 541 repeated with PKDL infectiousness set to zero (to simulate no 542 development of PKDL), and then again with the mean duration 543 of PKDL infectiousness halved (to simulate more rapid detection 544 and treatment of PKDL), and the percentage di erence in the total 545 number of cases in each \"alternative-intervention\" simulation from 546 that in each \"normal-intervention\" simulation calculated. 547 Ethical Approval.

However, unlike in our previous 79 study, we allow the possibility of transmission between individuals in di erent paras (hamlets). The reason for this is that 80 surveying of neighbouring paras was more complete in the two clusters of paras in the present study, and thus some minimum 81 inter-para household distances were less than intra-para household distances and within the maximum reported flight range 82 of P. argentipes sandflies (a few hundred metres (14-17)), so transmission between neighbouring surveyed paras may have 83 occurred.84Infectiousness over time. There is relatively little data available on the infectiousness of individuals in di erent L. donovani infection states over time. We therefore assume that the infectiousness of individuals remains constant within each state and 86 individuals in the same state have the same probability of passing on infection, such that an individual's infectiousness over 87 time takes the form of a step function(Fig. S1B). The relative infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals compared to VL 88 cases, h4, is assumed to take a fixed value between 0 and 0.02 based on estimates from previous modelling studies (3, 4, 18) 89 and preliminary results from xenodiagnosis studies that have so far not found infection in flies fed on asymptomatically infected 90 individuals (19).

This simplifies the estimation of recovery times for initially asymptomatically infected134 individuals (see Model for initial status of non-symptomatic individuals below) in the MCMC algorithm as it means that the 135 probability that an initially asymptomatically infected individual remains infected for a further t months is the same as if they 136 were infected in month 0 regardless of when they were infected. 137 Dormant infection duration.

Unlike for the incubation 141 period, we take 0 months to be the minimum duration of dormant infection, since two VL cases developed PKDL in the same 142 month as they were treated for VL, and one had simultaneous VL and PKDL.

In order to account for the uncertainty in the parameter estimates due to the missing asymptomatic 229 infection and recovery times, we need to estimate which individuals were asymptomatically infected during the study and 230 when they were infected, as part of the MCMC algorithm. To do this, we assign every non-symptomatic individual j in231 the population an asymptomatic infection time and recovery time pair, (Aj, Rj) oe {Vj, Vj + 1, . . . , Wj \u2260 1, T + 1} \u25ca {Aj + 232 1, Aj + 2, . . . , Wj \u2260 1, T + 1}, where asymptomatic infection and recovery before the study is labelled as (Aj, Rj) = (0, 0), 233 asymptomatic infection before and recovery during/after the study is labelled as (Aj, Rj) = (0, s), (s oe {1, . . . , T + 1}), and 234 no asymptomatic infection before or during the study is labelled as (Aj, Rj) = (T + 1, T + 1). Posterior distributions for the 235 asymptomatic infection and recovery time pairs are then estimated in the MCMC algorithm by proposing moves for these 236 pairs and accepting/rejecting them based on the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. The posterior distribution for 237 which non-symptomatic individuals were asymptomatically infected during the study can be estimated from the proportion of 238 time in the MCMC chain each individual spends in states other than (T + 1, T + 1). Since every non-symptomatic individual 239 has an infection and recovery time pair, with a finite set of possible values, the dimension of the model remains fixed and 240 reversible jump MCMC (RJMCMC) is not required. We note, however, that the algorithm described below for updating the 241 asymptomatic infection and recovery time pairs is equivalent to a classical RJMCMC algorithm in which only individuals that 242 are asymptomatically infected before or during the study have asymptomatic infection and recovery times and the number of 243 asymptomatic infections varies as asymptomatic infection times are added or removed in the steps of the algorithm (31-34). 244 As in the RJMCMC algorithm, the likelihood can be higher in the initial iterations of the chain than the value it ultimately 245 converges to in our approach since the number of asymptomatic infections in the likelihood changes as the number of pairs 246 corresponding to asymptomatic infection before or during the study changes, despite the fixed dimension of the parameter 247 space. 248 In order to sample e ectively from the posterior distribution of the asymptomatic infection and recovery times, we need 249 to use a proposal distribution that allows us to e ciently navigate the very large space of possible asymptomatic infection 250 and recovery time pairs. We therefore use the running estimate of the total infection pressure on each individual, averaged 251 over the history of the MCMC chain, to propose new asymptomatic infection times for non-symptomatic individuals. The 252 proposal distribution for individual j at the kth iteration of the MCMC chain thus consists of the probabilities of them being 253 asymptomatically infected at each time point according to the mean infection pressure on them at time t from the previous 254 samples in the chain, \u2044",

We block update the transmission parameters in step 1 of the algorithm above using a combination of the 'Accelerated Shaping' and 'Accelerated Scaling' algorithms described in (36). The AcceleratedShaping algorithm is a generalised version of the adaptive random walk Metropolis algorithm ofHaario et al. (37), which uses 420 the running estimate of the covariance matrix of the posterior distribution of the parameters from the MCMC chain in the 421 multivariate normal proposal distribution to automatically tune the proposal covariance matrix to make e cient proposals.422The Haario algorithm uses a fixed initial guess for the covariance matrix for a certain number of iterations at the start of the 423 chain and then the estimate of the covariance matrix from the whole history of the chain after that, including the initial values 424 and the burn-in, which can lead to slow convergence of the chain due to the sensitivity of the covariance estimate to outliers.425The Accelerated Shaping algorithm instead begins adapting straight away and removes early iterations of the chain from the 426 running estimate of the covariance matrix at a rate slower than it includes new iterations. This helps to ensure that the chain427 converges to the posterior mode quickly even if the initial guesses for the parameter values and covariance matrix are relatively 428 poor. 429 Ifk is the vector of the values of the transmission parameters at the kth iteration, then the proposal forat the (k + 1)th 430 iteration is given by 431 -\u00d5 k+1 = N (k , 2.38 2 c 2 k k+1 /n -) [22] 432 where k+1 and nare the running estimate of the covariance matrix and dimension of the posterior density for -, and c k 433 is a scaling constant that is tuned to achieve e cient mixing (see below). To discard early iterations at a slower rate than 434 new ones are included, a non-decreasing sequence of integers is used, f (that f (0) = 0 and f (k + 1) = f (k) or 435 f (k + 1) = f (k) + 1 for all k, and k+1 for k > 0 is defined as 436 k+1 =",

However, the mean times between infector onset and VL-infectee infections are much greater for PKDL whilst a similar intervention radius around new VL/PKDL cases of \u2265500m may be su cient to capture most secondary VL cases, the time window within which interventions need to be performed to prevent secondary cases is much narrower for VL cases than PKDL cases.",

Since we infer the unobserved infection times of VL cases and asymptomatic individuals as part of the MCMC algorithm, we can calculate the probability that each individual was infected by another individual conditional on their estimated infection month. Using these probabilities, we can then estimate the numbers of secondary infections generated by each infectious individual. The mean numbers of secondary infections per VL case and per PKDL case (Fig. 4C) show large variation, ranging from 0.4 to 28.3 for VL and 0.2 to 57.3 for PKDL (see Fig. S18 for the posterior distributions of the number of secondary infections generated by each VL and PKDL case), and are overdispersed, with shape parameters for fitted gamma disindicates that some cases generate far more secondary infections than others, a phenomenon known as 'super-spreading', of secondary infections for asymptomatic individuals are much lower, ranging from 0 to 0.87.

This is the hypothetical maximum proportion of VL cases that could be averted by preventing any PKDL, e.g. if there was a vaccine available that could prevent progression to PKDL (36). However, even if the mean duration of infectiousness of PKDL had only been halved (from 17.8 months to 8.9 months)-which represents a more realistically achievable target in the near future through improved active case detection-the simulations suggest the total number of VL cases would have been 9% lower (95% CI: -15, 29%).Fig. 4.

It is also the first study to combine infectiousness data from xenodiagnostic studies with geo-located VL and PKDL incidence data, and to use this to reconstruct transmission trees of the spread of VL through a community and estimate individual-level numbers of secondary infections.Our results support the conclusion that PKDL poses a significant threat to the VL elimination programme in the Indian subcontinent. Whilst VL cases drive transmission when VL incidence is high during the peak years of an epidemic, the contribution of PKDL to transmission increases as VL incidence decreases and PKDL prevalence increases in the downward phase of an epidemic. This mirrors the current situation in Bangladesh and India, where VL incidence has of PKDL cases suggest PKDL prevalence is higher than VL prevalence in some areas (19, 37).In the study area in Bangladesh the contribution of PKDL311 (in terms of contribution to new symptomatic infections) grew from close to 0% in the upward phase of the epidemic in 2002-2005, to approximately 55% at the end of the epidemic in 314 2010. In light of the current low VL incidence and considerable numbers of PKDL cases being reported in much of the Indian subcontinent, this suggests that measures need to be taken to ensure all PKDL cases are detected and treated in 318 order to maintain reduced transmission. This will require improvements in both active PKDL case detection, e.g. through comprehensive long-term follow-up of VL cases, and diagnostic tests and algorithms and treatment regimens for PKDL 322 (17, 38, 39).",

Model simulations suggest that incidence of VL could be reduced by faster detection and treatment of PKDL cases, e.g. by nearly 10% by halving the average duration of PKDL infectiousness, and by a quarter if it were possible to prevent PKDL altogether.The spatiotemporal patterns of transmission inferred from reconstructing the transmission tree suggest that infection makes both short and long jumps in space within each infection generation rather than spreading radially outward from index cases in a wave. This is consistent with findings from a spatial analysis of occurrence of VL cases around index cases of short and long distances (from tens to hundreds of metres) from the closest index case for secondary VL cases diagnosed close together in time.

PKDL cases can either resolve following treatment or naturally, whereupon they enter the recovered class. We assume that recovered individuals do not return to being susceptible, i.e. cannot be reinfected, irrespective of whether they have recovered from VL, PKDL or asymptomatic infection. It is still uncertain whether individuals can become reinfected with L. donovani parasites, particularly asymptomatically infected individuals. Most previous modelling studies have assumed or concluded that individuals can be reinfected (2-4), but have not accounted for spatial variation in transmission and available evidence suggests that repeat episodes of VL are relatively rare and are due to relapse not reinfection (5-7).For each individual i in the study population, we define Vi = max(0, Bi, IM i) and Wi = min(T + 1, EM i, Mi) as their times of entry into and exit from the study area respectively.
