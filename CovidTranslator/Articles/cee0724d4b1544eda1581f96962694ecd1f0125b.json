Virus plaque-reduction assays, PCR and RT-PCR analysis indicated that both drugs inhibited cell infection by PrV.

GL is active against herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and SARS coronavirus (Arase et al., 1997; Baba and Shigeta, 1987; Crance et al., 1994; Hoever et al., 2005; Ito et al., 1987 Ito et al., , 1988 Lin, 2003; Numazaki et al., 1994; Pompei et al., 1979; Sato et al., 1996; Utsunomiya et al., 1997) . Diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) is derived from the glycyrrhizin modified in the two carboxyl groups at the 6 and 6 position ( Fig. 1) . DG is more stable, soluble and has more significant bioactivities than GL. Lithium salts have been used as therapeutic substances for the treatment of 'gout and rheumatic gout', 'Bright's disease', epilepsy, syphilis, acute mania and depressive episodes (Skinner et al., 1980) . The effect of lithium salts on the replication of herpes simplex virus and vaccinia virus was documented (Skinner et al., 1980; Ziaie and Kefalides, 1989) . Recently, it was reported that lithium chloride inhibits infectious bronchitis virus, an RNA coronavirus in cell culture and such inhibition was due to a cellular rather than virucidal effect (Harrison et al., 2007) .",

PrV is a useful model organism for exploring herpesvirus biology. In swine and cattle, PrV infection can cause Aujeszky's disease (AD), which is one of the List B diseases of the Office international des \u00e9pizooties (OIE). Although pig is the natural reservoir for the virus, PrV has a broad host range and can infect most mammals and some avian species (Klupp et al., 2004) . In susceptible species, PrV infection is often lethal and infected animals may die from central nervous system disorders (Tirabassi and Enquist, 2000) . PrV infection poses a severe threat to animal husbandry and the development of effective antiviral agents is one important strategy to decrease the occurrence of PrV infection in addition to vaccination.",

Both drugs used in this study inhibited the virus-induced cell apoptosis, although some cells with early apoptosis were not affected by the drug treatment. We also investigated the cell apoptosis at 48 hpi, which gave the similar results with that at 12 hpi. It has been reported that point mutations in the ATP binding site of PrV US3 protein kinase prevented Bad phosphorylation and cell survival after apoptosis appearance and p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK signaling were involved in PrV apoptosis (Deruelle et al., 2007; Yeh et al., 2008) . The mechanisms regarding the effect of both drugs on apoptosis pathways are under investigation. Our flow cytometry analysis also suggested that LiCl had a more significant effect than DG in terms of their inhibitory activity against cell apoptosis. The microscopic scoring of fluorescent samples and the flow cytometric data indicated a similar reduction trend in cell apop-tosis by the addition of the drugs, however, there was difference in the degree of reduction of apoptosis. This discrepancy might be attributed to the difference from the both methods per se, such as criterion, cell status, system error, etc. The PCR results showed that the amplified amount of PrV gD gene was decreased with the increasing drug concentration, manifesting that both drugs appear to reduce the viral genome load via an unresolved mechanism. The RT-PCR results suggested that the compounds interfered with the viral gD gene. It is possible that the observed anti-apoptotic effect of DG and LiCl during PRV infection is indirect and due to the reduced virus replication caused by the drugs. Our future work will further try to elucidate whether the inhibition of PrV infection by LiCl is attributed to its direct virucidal effect or to its inhibitory activity against the replication of PrV.",

Our data showed that the pre-treatment of the viruses with DG inhibited the cell infection by PrV in a dose-dependent manner.

Like LiCl, DG showed a good inhibitory effect on cell apoptosis, after incubation of the drug with viruses. These data indicate that PrV infection induces cell apoptosis and addition of drugs also results in fewer apoptotic cells during PrV infection.",
