Proteases are not only involved in protein destruction, but also in activation, growth, cell division, differentiation, migration, signalling and other cellular processes. In addition, many viruses use cellular or viral proteases for various purposes, such as activation of their surface proteins or membrane fusion. Consequently, specific protease inhibitors are attractive drug candidates (TABLE 1) . Although the different specificities of proteases have been used during recent years to assess their activities in vitro, their actions have been difficult to determine under more-or-less physiological conditions. Proteases can be divided into a number of classes: the serine, aspartic, cysteine, threonine and metalloproteases. This classification scheme basically refers to the amino acid or metal that catalyses the nucleophilic attack on the substrate's peptide bonds. Enzymes with proteolytic activities have frequently evolved to carry out important tasks, which has resulted in large and divergent families of proteases. These often unrelated enzymes differ in many respects, but one characteristic unites them: they hydrolyse peptide bonds and thereby cut proteins into small pieces or a few distinct fragments. It is precisely this chemical reaction that allows the design of probes to selectively monitor protease activities.",

Proteins can be singled out for a number of reasons, including signs of malfunctioning or misfolding 1 . Although the vast majority of proteins face destruction when old and expired, a substantial fraction of newly synthesized proteins undergoes a similar fate 2,3 , possibly because they fail to adopt a proper conformation 4 . Because misfolded proteins tend to aggregate, the rapid recognition and degradation of such aberrant proteins is crucial for the survival of the cell 5, 6 . Moreover, in many cases the destruction of proteins is crucial for the correct control of cellular regulatory switches. In this case, their degradation is not a result of malfunctioning, and is in fact determined by specific spatially and temporally controlled signalling events 7 .",

Only proteins, which are specifically recruited to the proteasome, and subsequently unfolded and threaded into the core, can be degraded by this complex. The proteasome generally recognizes substrates by the presence of a poly-ubiquitin chain conjugated to an internal lysine residue of the substrate 38 or, less commonly, conjugated to the free amino terminus of the substrate 39, 40 . Proteins are modified by the addition of these polyubiquitin chains by specific ubiquitylation enzymes 41 that physically interact with degradation signals (such as misfolded domains, small motifs or post-translational modifications) that are detected in the substrate 42 . A crucial observation regarding protein processing was that the degradation signals that target proteins for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation behave as MODULAR DOMAINS 42 . These domains can often be functionally transferred to other proteins. With the identification of fluorescent proteins in jellyfish 43 and soft corals 128 , the possibility emerged of using fluorescent protein substrates resembling authentic protein substrates of the proteasome instead of the small fluorescent peptides commonly used in in vitro assays. that can be reused in the synthesis of new proteins. Endocytosed proteins do not usually enter the cytoplasm but are instead directed to lysosomal compartments (FIG. 1) . In the lysosomes, another group of proteases, the cathepsins 11 , degrades the internalized protein into pieces. These fragments are subsequently reduced to single amino acids by lysosomal aminopeptidases like TPP-I and dipeptidyl peptidase-II (DPP-II) 9 . Given the broad substrate specificity of the proteasome and cathepsins, these proteases have to be compartmentalized to prevent the random degradation of 'innocent bystanders' . This is achieved by placing the active sites of the proteases within large multisubunit complexes, in the case of the proteasome, or within lysosomes, in the case of cathepsins. In addition to these broadly acting proteases, there are other proteases involved in many more specific processes, such as blood clotting 12 , apoptosis 13 , extracellular matrix degradation 14 , cleavage of transmembrane proteins 15 and precursor processing in the secretory pathway 16 .",

And this is yet another one, but one describing a timely issue: how can protease activity be monitored in vivo? Given the chemistry of proteases, various fluorescent substrates have been designed during the past few years to test their activities as well as the effects of drug-mediated inhibition of these systems in cells or animals. Understanding the physiology of proteolytic processes inside the living organism is of crucial importance in assessing the roles of proteases in diseases and for developing drugs that target these systems.",

In the case of the UFD substrate, an N-terminal ubiquitin moiety fused to the GFP open reading frame functions as the acceptor for poly-ubiquitin chains (FIG. 4b) . Stack and co-workers showed that insertion of multiple UFD signals could further accelerate protein turnover and facilitate the degradation of alternative reporters, such as \u03b2-lactamase or luciferase, which remained stable on insertion of a single UFD signal 48 . (with fluorigenic peptide substrates) and the functional status of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (with the GFP reporters) revealed that cells contain a large excess of proteasomal activity 44, 50 , which is probably required to instantly clear misfolded proteins under stress conditions 59 .

As anticipated, the tissues of these mice did not emit GFP fluorescence despite the presence of reporter-encoding transcripts in all tissues analysed. The injection of proteasome inhibitors into these mice resulted in a dramatic increase in fluorescence intensities of affected tissues. In another animal model, a UFD bioluminescence reporter-expressing human cell line was implanted in nude mice.

They used a synthetic non-toxic and nonimmunogenic co-polymer that had previously been tested in clinical trials 89 and that was composed of a poly-lysine backbone, which was stabilized through the conjugation of multiple polyethylene glycol side chains. Fluorophores were coupled at a high density to these backbones 80 . Identical fluorophores will interfere with each other and increase their relaxation times when excited, similar to normal FRET pairs (FIG. 3d) . Although the mechanism is not fully understood, this results in quenching unless the fluorophores are diluted by degradation. Indeed it was found that the emission signal was efficiently quenched in the intact co-polymer, rendering it almost non-fluorescent, whereas in vitro cleavage of the probe considerably increased emitted light 88 . To measure the fluorescence in living animals a dye was used that is excited with near-infrared light, which because of its long wavelength will hardly be scattered or absorbed by the tissue. This NIRF probe was expected to function as a general molecular probe for the lysosomal proteases that are able to cleave the poly-lysine backbone. Activation of the probe could be followed in cells, and inhibitor experiments confirmed that lysosomal cysteine and serine proteases were primarily responsible for activation of the NIRF reporter in cell lines 88 . Using xenotransplantation of human tumours in nude mice, it was shown that the NIRF probe was predominantly taken up and activated in the tumour tissues, possibly as a consequence of their relatively permeable neovasculature 90, 91 . With the non-invasive near-infrared reflecting imaging technique, small tumours containing cleaved NIRF probes could be identified at a maximal tissue depth of 1 cm 90 .",

The lysosomal cathepsins are essential to the turnover of proteins that reach the lysosomal compartment from the extracellular space (by endocytosis), the secretory pathway (by sorting) or the cytosol (by autophagy) and have more subtle regulatory functions in MHC class II antigen presentation 81 . Lysosomal proteases are believed to be involved in diseases such as cancer, inflammation, autoimmune disorders, atherosclerosis and several genetic disorders 82 . It has been shown that these proteases can participate in the destruction of the extracellular matrix surrounding tumours, which is an important prerequisite for tumour invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis 83 . However, because most cathepsins have important roles in lysosomal protein turnover, caution should be taken in inhibiting these enzymes, as impairment of cathepsins can result in lysosomal storage diseases. More specialized lysosomal proteases, such as cathepsin S, which is expressed in the immune system and assists in MHC class II antigen presentation, are also important drug targets. In fact, selective inhibitors of cathepsin S have been developed 84, 85 , and have been shown to prevent autoimmune responses in a mouse model of Sj\u00f6gren syndrome 85 (TABLE 1) .",

This will be possible only when the donor/acceptor pair are separated by a very short distance (<100 \u00c5). This is usually one-quarter or less of the light wavelength used to excite the donor fluorophore. Because it is acting at such a short distance, the principle of energy transfer is not by emission of a photon that is captured by the acceptor fluorophore, but merely electromagnetic energy transfer as a result of dipole moments. FRET efficiency is highly dependent on distance and decays with distance, as formulated in Forster's law 124 .

Induction of apoptosis in cells expressing this fusion protein resulted in a loss of the FRET signal between the BFP donor and GFP acceptor as a consequence of caspase-3 activation. A major drawback of the BFP-GFP FRET pair is that the BFP donor is excited by ultraviolet light, which causes considerable cellular damage and is therefore far from optimal for studies with living cells. Several new spectral variants, based on modified GFP or fluorescent proteins from other sources, have been generated during the past few years 106 . Ultraviolet excitation is avoided in the more recent caspase-3 FRET probe, in which the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) are combined 107 (FIG. 5b) . By changing the connecting peptide sequence between the CFP-YFP combination, the FRET probe was converted to a probe specific for the initiator caspase-8 (REF. 108 ). In this study, another advantage of the modular composition of the FRET probes was exploited. Instead of introducing a small cleavage site, larger protein fragments can be inserted because the probe is basically composed of three independent modular domains. In this reporter, the caspase-8 target, BH3interacting domain death agonist (BID), was used to generate a functional YFP-BID-CFP reporter (FIG. 5c) 108 .",

Recently, reporters for caspase-3 have been constructed by combining GFP and YFP, which do not suffer from these limitations 109 (FIG. 5d) . Optical filters cannot separate the largely overlapping excitation and emission spectra of these proteins and therefore energy transfer is difficult to quantify by sensitized emission FRET. An alternative quantitative method is fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), which can measure energy transfer between probes with overlapping or even identical spectra 109 . FLIM measures the effect of two closely located fluorophores on the relaxation time of the donor and acceptor, which is a consequence of FRET. Like FRET, FLIM decays rapidly with distance and is detectable when the fluorophores are within 10-100 \u00c5 of one another. Using pulsed light sources, changes in the relaxation time can be determined. Although energy Because the lysine composition of the co-polymer is important for the in vivo stability of this probe, the specificity cannot be changed by modifying the aminoacid sequence of the co-polymer itself. Instead, a strategy was used in which the fluorophores were connected to the copolymer backbone on peptide stalks conjugated by an isopeptide linkage to the lysine backbone. By changing the amino-acid sequence of the peptide stalk into protease cleavage sites, the probe could be converted into a substrate for specific proteases without losing in vivo stability. With this approach, specific NIRF reporters were generated for cathepsin D 93 and MMP-2 (REFS 94, 95) . In vivo imaging of tumour-bearing mice after probe administration could be used to discriminate between tumours expressing low or high levels of the selected proteases 90, 93, 94 . More recently, similar probes were used for imaging lymph nodes in living mice 96, 97 . Not only can these reporters be helpful for the detailed evaluation of the effect of potential drugs on lysosomal and extracellular proteases in vivo, they might also aid early diagnosis of tumours or atherosclerotic lesions, at least when imaging techniques will allow visualization of these probes deep in tissue.",

The stabilization or destabilization of the GFP reporter as a consequence of caspase activity could be quantified in living cells by flow cytometric or fluorimetric analyses 110 .

The HIV-1 genome encodes an aspartic protease that is essential for the generation of infectious virus particles 112 . The development of drugs that target this protease has been a successful endeavour, resulting in drugs such as ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir (Crixivan; Merck), nelfinavir (Viracept; Agouron/Pfizer) and lopinavir (Kaletra; Abbot Laboratories) (TABLE 1) . HIV-1 protease inhibitors are now routinely used as part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a regime that can efficiently control HIV replication in patients 113 . Because HAART can successfully suppress but not eradicate the virus in patients, ongoing viral replication often results in the emergence of inhibitor-resistant viral strains 114 . There is therefore a need for novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors, as well as diagnostic tests to identify and anticipate inhibitor-resistant strains.",

The presence of HIV-1 protease is toxic for cells, which is not surprising considering that this protease has broad specificity and cleaves many cellular substrates 115, 116 . Two considerations were taken into account when designing a GFP-based reporter for HIV-1 protease. First, the protease must be released from its precursor to become fully active; and second, the presence of fully active protease is toxic for cells. By generating an artificial precursor composed of GFP and the HIV-1 protease, a simple but robust reporter was made based on these two characteristics 117 . Transient transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding this non-toxic GFP-HIV-1 protease construct typically results in very low GFP levels, as cells that express this precursor will die because of the presence of the processed and fully active protease. The administration of different inhibitors to cells transfected with these reporters resulted in a dose-dependent increase in GFP fluorescence, due to accumulation of the unprocessed, non-toxic GFP-HIV-1 protease precursor.

An interesting difference between following in vivo degradation of designed substrates, as compared with in vitro assays with purified components, is that the designed substrates, which are analogous to genuine substrates, can be subject to multiple cleavage events. For example, it has been shown that degradation of the GFP-based substrates for the ubiquitin-proteasome system can also be influenced by inhibitors of unrelated serine proteases that are apparently directly or indirectly involved in this proteolytic system 123 . The FRET caspase reporters and NIRF cathepsin reporters are also subject to cleavage by several caspases 88, 107 . Although this might complicate the interpretation of the cleavage events, it reflects the in vivo situation of substrates and might aid the identification of novel proteases and unanticipated connections between proteolytic systems.",

The HIV-1 protease inhibitors exemplify the successful approach of targeting viral proteases, and presently much effort is put into the development of similar compounds inhibiting proteases of other life-threatening viruses, such as the proteases of hepatitis C virus 118 Reits and co-workers used an indirect approach to monitor intracellular protein degradation in living cells. They followed the activity of a peptide transporter that is involved in antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules 120 . They showed that a GFP-tagged TRANSPORTER ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIGEN PROCESSING (TAP) could be used to indirectly monitor the generation of small peptide fragments by intracellular proteases 2 . Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) techniques 121 to visualize TAP diffusion in the ER membrane, it was shown that TAP diffuses rapidly when inactive, and slowly when in the process of pumping peptides. These differences in mobility probably reflect differences in shape or radius, as predicted by modifications of the Einstein-Stocks formula, in which diffusion is correlated with ln(1/r), where r is the radius of the protein in the membrane 121 . Recording of the mobility of TAP in living cells has been used to show that a large portion of peptides are generated from proteins that are immediately degraded after translation, to visualize the contribution of influenza infection to the intracellular peptide pool 2 and to visualize the effect of \u03b3-irradiation on intracellular peptide degradation (E. Reits and J. N., unpublished results). The disadvantage of this technique is that it is rather complicated; TRANSPORTER ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIGEN PROCESSING (TAP).

Recycling of intracellular and internalized proteins. Proteins present in the cytosol and nucleus are degraded by the proteasome into peptide fragments that are further degraded by TPP-II, TOP, LAP and other peptidases into single amino acids. Internalized proteins are transported to the lysosomes, where cathepsins, TPP-I, DPP-II and other proteases digest the proteins to single amino acids. Not shown in this scheme are the more dedicated proteases, as discussed in the text. DPP, dipeptidyl peptidase; LAP, leucine aminopeptidase; TOP, thimet oligopeptidase; TPP, tripeptidyl peptidase.",

Coupling of a degradation signal (DEG) to GFP will result in targeting of the GFP for ubiquitylation followed by proteasomal degradation. Degradation of the GFP substrate results in loss of fluorescence. b | Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) fluorophore peptide substrate. A FRET peptide substrate contains a donor and acceptor fluorophore with spectral overlap. When the FRET probe is intact and excited with the optimal wavelength for the donor, acceptor fluorescence will be emitted at the expense of donor fluorescence. Cleavage of the FRET probe results in separation of donor and acceptor fluorophores and increased emission from the donor with a concomitant loss of acceptor fluorescence. c | Quenching with fluorophore/quencher pair in peptide substrate. Small peptide fragments containing a fluorophore and a corresponding quencher will be essentially non-fluorescent. After cleavage, when the quencher is spatially separated from the fluorophore, the fluorophore will emit fluorescence. d | Quenching with identical fluorophores in peptide substrate. Two identical fluorophores will quench each other. Principle as in b. e | FRET fluorescent proteins. With CFP and YFP as donor and acceptor fluorophore, respectively. Principle as in b.
