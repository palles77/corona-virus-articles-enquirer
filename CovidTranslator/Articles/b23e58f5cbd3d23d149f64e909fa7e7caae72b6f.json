            "text": "The aim is to diagnose COVID-19 earlier and to improve its treatment by applying medical technology, the ''COVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp)\" based on the Internet of Things. Terminal eight functions can be implemented in real-time online communication with the ''cloud\" through the page selection key. According to existing data, questionnaires, and check results, the diagnosis is automatically generated as confirmed, suspected, or suspicious of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection. It classifies patients into mild, moderate, severe or critical pneumonia. nCapp can also establish an online COVID-19 real-time update database, and it updates the model of diagnosis in real time based on the latest real-world case data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, nCapp can guide treatment. Front-line physicians, experts, and managers are linked to perform consultation and prevention. nCapp also contributes to the long-term follow-up of patients with COVID-19. The ultimate goal is to enable different levels of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment among different doctors from different hospitals to upgrade to the national and international through the intelligent assistance of the nCapp system. In this way, we can block disease transmission, avoid physician infection, and epidemic prevention and control as soon as possible. The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) was detected in Wuhan at the end of 2019 in cases of unexplained pneumonia. 1,2 The 2019-nCoV, which is a new coronavirus strain that has never been previously reported in humans, 3, 4 has aroused concern. On February 8, 2020, 2019-nCoV-induced pneumonia was officially named as novel coronavirus pneumonia in China. 5 On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization named the disease caused by 2019-nCoV as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 6 The number of patients with COVID-19 has rapidly increased, with nearly 80,000 reported cases currently. The virus is transmitted mainly through infected respiratory droplets and on close contact with the infected person. The incubation period can be as long as 2 weeks or even longer, and it is highly contagious. 7 The main target organ is the lung. Some patients with severe infection gradually develop respiratory failure, even acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, and ultimately death. 8, 9 Therefore, it is important to identify, report, isolate, and treat individuals at the early stages of the disease to control its spread. However, the current diagnosis of COVID-19 is mainly dependent on viral nucleic acid testing. The accuracy of current nucleic acid testing is approximately 30-50%. A large number of suspected or suspicious cases may be missed, which is not conducive to the isolation and treatment of patients. 10 The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China promulgated the ''Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Pneumonia of COVID-19 (Interim Version 5)\", 11 which proposed clinical diagnostic criteria based on chest imaging, and proposed Version 6. 12 However, considering the different levels of diagnosis and treatment among doctors in different regions and hospitals, some cases are still missed or misdiagnosed, especially when the nucleic acid test has a negative result. Additionally, patients suspected of having this disease have not been identified in the interim version. A study conducted at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York 13 revealed that changes observed in computed tomography (CT) can precede the detection of nucleic acid tests in some patients. To control this epidemic in various regions, it is important to appropriately manage patients suspected of having the disease, immediately identify and isolate the source of infection, cut off the transmission route, and prevent viral transmission from these potential patients or virus carriers. Therefore, we have formulated consensus version 1 by convening clinicians with rich clinical experience, clinicians supporting front-line work in Wuhan, and biomedical, statistical, and information technology engineers through the Internet. 14 We aimed to apply the COVID-19 Intelligent Diagnosis and Treatment Assistant Program (nCapp) based on the Internet of Things (IoT) medical technology to conduct clinical work during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially for outpatients, and quality control (QC) will assist the diagnosis and treatment, and achieve early identification, isolation, and treatment of patients with COVID-19. This consensus is appropriate for different specialists at all levels of hospitals and even managers at all levels of hospitals, local community development corporations, and public health centers. This will enable them with intelligent assistance to work in the timely discovery, isolation, and management of patients who are confirmed, suspected, and suspicious to have the disease through the nCapp.",

Hence, we have revised the consensus based on these valuable opinions and published it in English to meet more requirements. The IoT was originally referred to as radio-frequency identification technology and equipment combined with the Internet based on the agreed communication protocol to achieve intelligent management of item information. Today, this concept has been expanded and deepened, that is, the use of communication technologies such as local networks or the Internet to connect sensors, machines, people, and things to achieve the connection between people and things, things and things, people-oriented informationization, and remote control and intelligent management. The most basic functional feature of the IoT is ''ubiquitous connectivity.\" Its three basic processes are comprehensive perception ? reliable transmission ? intelligent processing. The application of the IoT to medicine is referred to as the medical IoT (MIoT), [15] [16] [17] [18] which aims to establish a decision-oriented big data analysis model supported by information technology such as communication, electronics, biology, and medicine.",

To avoid missed diagnosis, these suspected patients should be isolated and monitored until a confirmed or excluded diagnosis is established in the designated hospitals. The patients' body temperature should be normal for more than 3 days, and the respiratory symptoms should improve significantly. During the treatment, superior doctors and high level hospitals are well informed about the patients' status by using nCapp. Doctors can continue the original treatment which focuses on relieving symptoms from fever and cough. In case of treatment difficulties, doctors can request for the assistance of a cloud expert link to interact with experts or front-line experienced physicians online. 14 ",
