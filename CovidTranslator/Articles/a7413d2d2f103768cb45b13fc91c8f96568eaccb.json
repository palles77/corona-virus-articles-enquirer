Here we sought to develop new G-quadruplex ligands to be exploited as antiviral compounds by enhancing binding toward the viral G-quadruplex structures. We synthesized naphthalene diimide derivatives with a lateral expansion of the aromatic core. The new compounds were able to bind/stabilize the G-quadruplex to a high extent, and some of them displayed clear-cut selectivity toward the viral G-quadruplexes with respect to the human telomeric Gquadruplexes. This feature translated into low nanomolar anti-HIV-1 activity toward two viral strains and encouraging selectivity indexes. The selectivity depended on specific recognition of LTR loop residues; the mechanism of action was ascribed to inhibition of LTR promoter activity in cells. This is the first example of G-quadruplex ligands that show increased selectivity toward the viral G-quadruplexes and display remarkable antiviral activity.",

G4 structures may significantly vary, both in terms of strand stoichiometry (forming both inter-and intramolecular structures) and strand orientation/topology. The presence of K + cations specifically supports G4 formation and stability. 4\u22126 In the human genome and in prokaryotes, G4 DNA motifs have been found in telomeres, G-rich micro-and mini-satellites, near oncogene promoters, and within the rDNA. 7\u221212 Human G4 DNA motifs have been reported to be associated with recombination prone regions 13 and to show mutational patterns that preserve the potential to form G4 DNA structures. 9 Misregulation of these G4 structures has been associated with relevant human neurological disorders. 14\u221218 The identification of G4 binding proteins 19 and their visualization in cells with antibody-based technology 20, 21 have also provided convincing evidence of the existence of cellular G4s in vivo.",

These studies have shown that G4 folding at the LTR promoter decreased viral transcription with an effect that was augmented by a G4 ligand. 27, 30 The involvement of G4 structures in several human diseases propelled the development of G4 ligands.

            "text": "Design and Synthesis of c-exNDIs. We have designed and synthesized a small library of new and water-soluble c-exNDIs (2\u221211, Scheme 2), where the NDI core has been merged to the dihydrobenzophenazine polynuclear heterocycle (highlighted in red in Scheme 1). The choice has been made based on the pK a values of the N,N-dimethylpropan-amine side chains: the pK a values are above 7 (pK a1 = 8.1, pK a2 = 8.6), 52 suggesting that the side chains are mainly protonated under physiological conditions. This aspect ensures good solubilizing properties, reducing self-aggregations. We discharged the shorter N,N-dimethylthyl-amine side chains, as their pK a values are much lower (pK a1 = 5.6, pK a2 = 7.4). The c-exNDIs are structurally characterized by a larger flat core than the NDIs. This feature should improve \u03c0-stacking interaction implementing the binding to the G4. Indeed, DFT calculation performed at B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory in gas phase indicated that the dimension of the c-exNDI core supported a more extensive overlap to the quartet of the G4 structure (Supporting Information, Figure S1 ). Enhancement of the ligand steric hindrance accessing the outside G4 quartets might offer an opportunity to implement selectivity as well. Furthermore, the proposed structural extension on the NDI scaffold should merge the useful optoelectronic properties (absorption, emission, and singlet oxygen sensitizer) of functionalized NDIs to those of substituted dihydrobenzophenazines. Compounds with both H and Br substituents at the Y position were considered to evaluate the effect of a bulky substituent (Br) at this position. To synthesize the c-exNDIs, we developed the synthetic protocol highlighted in Scheme 2. According to published methods, the imidation reaction of the readily available 2,6-dibromo-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride yielded the 2,6-dibromo-substituted NDI, under acidic conditions, in almost quantitative yield. Subsequently, a two-step protocol starting from a nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S N Ar) in the presence of an excess (2.5 equiv) of ortho-diaminophenyl derivatives in DMF as solvent at 70\u00b0C for 16 h afforded a 60:40 mixture of monobrominated and debrominated products in an overall quantitative yield. The ring closing reaction following the S N Ar in one pot (step a, in Scheme 2) occurred through a Tchitchibabin mechanism, with the elimination of hydride favored by the formation of a sixmembered ring. The second S N Ar on the remaining aromatic bromide was carried out by dissolving 3 in neat N 1 ,N 1dimethylpropane-1,3-diamine. To improve the reaction yield, we optimized a microwave-assisted protocol (150\u00b0C, 200 psi, 250 bar, 200 W, 3 min, sealed reaction vessels) to give product 9, which crystallized from the reaction mixture. We achieved the synthesis of the permanently charged quaternary ammonium salts 10 and 11 with a classical exhaustive methylation, in the presence of MeI at rt for 16 h. All the synthesized ligands (2\u221211) were purified by preparative HPLC (CH 3 CN:H 2 O and 0.1% CF 3 COOH as eluent). Further anion exchange yielded 2\u22129 as hydrochloride salts. On the contrary, 10 and 11 were investigated as iodide quaternary ammonium salts.",

            "text": "c-exNDIs Greatly Stabilize G4 with a Preference for the LTR Conformations vs the Telomeric Sequence. To detect the ability of the new c-exNDIs to bind and stabilize the G4 conformations of the HIV-1 LTR promoter, two G4forming LTR sequences were employed: LTR-III and LTR-IV, both composed of four GGG tracts ( Figure 1A ). When embedded within the full-length G-rich sequence of the LTR promoter, LTR-III is the most stable G4, while LTR-IV folds when induced by G4 ligands. 27 A FRET melting assay was performed to assess the degree of stabilization of the LTR-III and LTR-IV G4 by c-exNDIs. The minimal intramolecular G4forming human telomeric (hTel) sequence ( Figure 1A ) was employed to evaluate the activity of the c-exNDIs on one of the most highly represented and accessible cellular G4: in fact, the TTAGGG repeat is present as 2000\u22123000 double-stranded (ds) and 50\u2212200 single-stranded sequences at the human telomeres. 53 A double-stranded (ds) DNA was also added to address specificity toward the G4 conformation (Supporting Information, Table S1 ). While this kind of assay is typically performed using molar excess of the tested compounds, we here initially employed equimolar amounts of the target DNA sequence and compounds (i.e., 0.25 \u03bcM) to better differentiate the stabilization efficiency among the different c-exNDIs. The melting temperatures of the LTR-III, LTR-IV, hTel, and dsDNA G4 conformations were sufficiently similar (66.9, 61.9, 66.9, and 66.5\u00b0C, respectively) to allow a meaningful comparison. In the presence of the c-exNDIs, a marked increase in the stabilization of the G4-forming oligonucleotides was observed ( Figure 1B and Supporting Information, Table  S2 ). Among the tested c-exNDIs, 2, 3, 4, 10, and 11 were the most efficient ligands, with a stabilization on LTR-IV G4 of 10\u221216\u00b0C at equimolar amounts. At 4-fold c-exNDI:DNA molar ratio, the stabilization increased to above 25\u00b0C, which is the maximum increase measurable in these settings (data not shown). The other c-exNDIs showed intermediate (4\u00b0C \u2264 \u0394T m < 7\u00b0C, 5, 6, and 7), or low (\u0394T m < 4\u00b0C, 8 and 9) level of stabilization on LTR-IV G4. Compounds 2 and 10 stabilized LTR-III G4 above 10\u00b0C. Among the G4 structures, hTel G4 was the least efficiently stabilized, whereas stabilization on dsDNA was negligible. Only compounds 10 and 11 displayed a significant stabilization on dsDNA, indicating that the presence of two permanent charges (the quaternary ammonium moieties) favors an unspecific binding to the negatively charged nucleic acid. In general, the H series of all derivatives (Y = H, 2, 4, 6, 10; Scheme 2) was more active and more selective for the viral G4s compared to the Br substituted ones (Y = Br, 3, 5, 7, 8; Scheme 2). Compounds 2, 3, and 10 exhibited a difference in stabilization of LTR-IV G4s vs hTel G4 equal or above 6\u00b0C, which roughly corresponds to 40% of the overall stabilization efficiency ( Figure 1B and Supporting Information, Table S2 ).",

We first confirmed by CD analysis that in the buffer conditions used for the ESI/MS experiments the topology of the G4folded oligonucleotides did not significantly modify (Supporting Information, Figure S3 ) Equimolar amounts of LTR-III/ hTel, LTR-IV/hTel, and LTR-III/LTR-IV G4s were incubated with 2-fold molar excess of compounds 2 or 4. Because ESI/ MS transfers intact biomolecules complexes in the gas phase and signal intensity is proportional to the abundance of each species in solution, the ratio between m/z signals of each bound species and the corresponding bound and free G4 ( Figure 2A ) was calculated (Table 1) . While LTR-III and LTR-IV were detected mostly as all-bound species, hTel was mostly unbound ( Figure 2A , and Supporting Information, Figures S4A and  S4B ). This analysis clearly shows that our c-exNDIs preferentially bind the two viral sequences over the telomeric sequence. To corroborate the selectivity toward the viral sequences, two additional cellular G4 folding sequences were evaluated: c-kit2 57 and c-myc. 32 The LTR G4s were preferred over c-kit2 G4 by both compounds; in the case of c-myc G4, compound 4 preferentially bound to the LTR G4s, whereas compound 2 showed more intense binding to c-myc (Table 1) . Therefore, we confirmed a general, even though not absolute, selectivity toward the LTR G4s. It is also possible that the much higher stability of the c-myc G4 (T m > 95\u00b0C) vs the stability of the other tested G4s (LTR-III 66.9\u00b0C, LTR-IV 61.9\u00b0C",

To this end, we evaluated the protection exerted by compound 2 over residues of the LTR G4s against clerocidin (CL). This molecule has been shown to alkylate DNA single-stranded G, C, and A bases 58, 59 and to be able to predict G4 structural folding. 60 Labeled oligonucleotides were folded, treated with increasing amounts of 2, exposed to CL, and further treated with piperidine to highlight CL-alkylated sites. In these settings, we expected to visualize only loop bases bound by the c-exNDI because base-paired Gs involved in G-quartet formation would not be available to CL alkylation, independently of the presence of the compound. The NMR structure of LTR-IV has been solved (PDB code 2N4Y), and therefore we were able to assess that nucleotides affected by the presence of the c-exNDI were in two loops of the structure: in particular, in the ACTG loop the A base was protected, whereas C and G were exposed; in the 1-base-loop, the C base was exposed ( Figure 2C and 2E). The structure of LTR-III has not been solved yet, however, previous data indicated that this G4 can fold into different conformations, the main one of which is likely the one depicted in Figure 2E , as detected by low-resolution structural data. 27 In this case, we observed protection of the C base in the ACTG loop ( Figure 2D ), which is shared with the LTR-IV sequence (see Figure 1A ); three additional residues (C, C, and G) were protected in the 11-base-loop ( Figure 2D and 2E). Protection and exposure of residues indicated specific interaction of 2 at the affected LTR sites. Interestingly, unique LTR loops and in particular the ACTG loop shared by both LTR-III and LTR-IV, and absent in the telomeric sequence, were involved, indicating that these are likely the moieties that induce selectivity. We cannot exclude that other regions are bound by the c-exNDI, but probably the interaction at other sites is less stable or more ",

We have previously shown that the HIV-1 viral promoter folds into dynamic G4s and that stabilization of these G4 conformations by the G4 ligand 1 represses viral transcription and virus production in infected cells with IC 50 (the concentration required to inhibit 50% of virus production) in the low \u03bcM range. 27, 30 The average selectivity index (SI) for 1 was 12. Given the c-exNDI binding/ stabilization selectivity observed in vitro for the viral G4s vs the cellular G4, we set out to investigate the anti-HIV-1 activity of the newly synthesized c-exNDI derivatives. Compound entry was preliminarily measured by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy, taking advantage of the blue-colored c-exNDI dyes (\u03bb abs = 555 and 600 nm, for the unsubstituted 2) and their red fluorescence emission (\u03bb em = 610 and 655 nm, for 2). After 30 min of incubation, compounds concentrated into the cell (Supporting Information, Figure S7 ). We next treated infected cells with increasing amounts of compounds and measured virus production; concurrently, the cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) of the c-exNDIs in the same conditions but on uninfected cells was measured by MTT assay. All compounds were tested against the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain, which is a X4 strain. Results are reported in Table 2 . Compounds 2, 3, 4, and 5 displayed inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values below 25 nM. Compound 2 displayed a promising SI of 40, the best among the tested c-exNDIs, whereas SI values of compound 3, 4, and 5 were around 20, again superior to 1. Derivatives 6 and 7 exhibited low activity and low cytotoxicity, while 9 showed the worst combination with low activity, high cytotoxicity, and SI of 2.2. We also evaluated the range of concentration (therapeutic window or TW), at which we obtained antiviral activity paralleled by less than 80% cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure 3A , 2 displayed the widest TW (3.9\u2212250 nM); 4 and 5 also showed interesting TW values; TW concentrations for 6 and 7, which are likely to be mainly monoanionic under physiological conditions as both the (CH 2 ) 3 NHMe 2 + moieties exhibit a pK a >8.1, 52 were in the \u03bcM range; no TW was observed for 8 and 9 (Table 1) . Finally, 10 and 11, containing two quaternary ammonium moieties, did not display any antiviral or cytotoxic activity likely due to their inability to enter the cells, as already shown for NDIs with permanent positive charges. 61 Compound 2 and 3 were also tested on the HIV-1",

Second, these compounds exhibited a very promising antiviral activity. Compared to 1, 30 the best antiviral 2\u22125 showed improved IC 50 values (in the low nM vs low \u03bcM range).

The viral and telomeric G4s are likely the two most abundant DNA G4 species in the cell during infection, therefore a preferential effect on the viral G4s would result in higher antiviral activity and lower cytotoxicity, as observed. The c-exNDIs displayed both selective binding affinity and stabilization for the viral G4s. Between the two LTR G4s, the LTR-III sequence was most efficiently bound by 2, as measured by ESI/MS and SPR. Even though LTR-III (38 nts) and LTR-IV (29 nts) display an identical number of Gquartets, LTR-III offers longer loops that may accommodate additional molecules and therefore may display increased binding affinity. Indeed, at saturating concentrations, binding of up to three c-exNDI molecules was observed by ESI/MS with LTR-III compared to two molecules for LTR-IV. In ",

            "text": "Article addition, two loops in both LTR-III and LTR-IV G4s were shown to be involved in c-exNDI interaction by footprinting analyses. We suggest that the compounds interact with the edge G-quartets through the core NDI planar aromatic surface, while the extended moiety and side chains interact with the side loops, affording selectivity toward the LTR G4s. To our knowledge, this is the first example of this type of selectivity based on chemical recognition of specific residues; in fact, previously reported selectivity rather relied on the recognition of a G4 conformation. 65 Analysis of the binding activity of the series of c-exNDIs led us to the following structure\u2212activity relationship (SAR) conclusions: (i) the nonextended side of the c-exNDI core [position Y (Scheme 1)], lacking substituents as the introduction of an aminoalkyl side chain, highly hinders stabilization of the G4 structures (i.e., 9); (ii) Br is allowed as Y substituent, but it lowers binding and selectivity toward the viral sequences. The Br group may both hinder specific interactions (hence lower selectivity) and partially distort the aromatic core from planarity (hence lower G4 binding); (iii) the pyridine ring in place of the benzene in the extended core is strongly detrimental (compound 8). The fair antiviral activity is paralleled by moderate cytotoxicity, allowing no TW, possibly due to off-target activity; (iv) the NO 2 moiety is allowed (compounds 4 and 5) as compound 4 is the most powerful and selective ligand toward LTR-III; (v) the negatively charged carboxylate group decrease the electrostatic component of the binding to the DNA G4s (compounds 6 and 7); (vi) on the contrary, the permanently positively charged ammonium groups extensively increase binding to the target G4s by adding electrostatic interaction (compounds 10 and 11). However, compounds with permanent charges are not suitable for cell entry and hence cannot be exploited for antiviral purposes. A scheme of the chemical properties that lead to high-affinity recognition and selectivity of the c-exNDI binders is reported in the graphical abstract.",

The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) was defined as the concentration of test compound that was able to reduce the absorbance of the mockinfected cells by 50%. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was defined as the concentration of test compound that inhibit 50% of LTR-Luciferase signal. The selectivity index (SI) is the relative effectiveness of the tested compound in inhibiting viral replication compared to inducing cell death (CC 50 value/IC 50 value). The therapeutic window (TW) is the concentration range at which the compound shows antiviral activity paralleled by less than 80% cytotoxicity.",

Antiviral activity, expressed as relative luciferase units (RLU), was measured on infected cells, while cell viability was in parallel obtained with a MTT assay on the uninfected cells. The vertical dotted lines define the therapeutic window (TW) where the compound is active against the virus and not toxic against the cells. This figure is representative of the antiviral/cytotoxicity/TW experiments performed with the whole series of c-exNDI compounds. (B) Entry assay. TZM-bl cells were treated with the compound 2 (50\u2212100 nM), AZT (0.5 \u03bcg/mL), or the entry inhibitor DS (100 \u03bcg/mL) at 0, 1, or 2 h pi. Virus production was measured at 31 h pi as RLU. The control depicts cells infected with the virus lacking compound treatment. (C) Effect of 2 on the LTR promoter activity compared to cytotoxicity. HeLa cells with a stably transfected LTR-EGFP reporter plasmid were treated with increasing concentrations of 2 (62.5\u2212250 nM). EGFP mean was measured by FACS analysis. Cytotoxicity was estimate in parallel by gating on forward scatter (FSC) vs side scatter (SSC) using untreated cells as reference.
