We inoculated BALB/c (H2 d ) mice with 17DD yellow fever vaccine to investigate the correlations between approaches used for epitope discovery: ELISPOT assays, binding assays, and prediction software. Our results showed a good agreement between ELISPOT and binding assays, which seemed to correlate with the protein immunogenicity. PRED BALB/c prediction software partially agreed with the ELISPOT and binding assay results, but presented low specificity. The use of prediction software to exclude peptides containing no epitopes, followed by high throughput screening of the remaining peptides by ELISPOT, and the use of MHC-biding assays to characterize the MHC restrictions demonstrated to be an efficient strategy. The results allowed the characterization of 2 MHC class I and 17 class II epitopes in the envelope protein of the YF virus in BALB/c (H2 d ) mice.",

Immunome, as defined by Sette and co-workers (Sette et al., 2005) , is the detailed map of immune reactions of a given host interacting with a foreign antigen, and immunomics can be defined as the study of immunomes. The identification of the T and B cell immune response targets allows the design of antigenic formulations focused on selected epitopes, for instance, promoting more robust responses against subdominant epitopes contained in conserved sequences that do not easily tolerate mutants escape. In addition, it makes it possible to avoid the presence of inhibitory epitopes (Disis et al., 1996) , allows the combination of many epitopes from different proteins or organisms (Sercarz et al.,1993) and the avoidance of immunopathogenic epitopes. Hence, immunomics offers a powerful approach to the rational design of vaccines (Sette and Fikes, 2003) .",

Among those, ELISPOT offers many positive advantages with regards to characterizing the immune response (e.g. looking at different cytokines and/or subpopulations of cells), by offering some degree of automation, broader options for readouts (e.g., , the screening of large number of peptides, and rapid results (Anthony and Lehmann, 2003) . Although the length of the peptides used in ELISPOT assays can vary from 9 to 20 amino acids, libraries of 15 amino acids (15mers) with an offset of 11 amino acids seem to represent the best compromise between epitope coverage of a protein sequence and the ability to detect CD4 + and CD8 + responses (Kiecker et al., 2004) .",

These factors can be highly affected by how the antigen formulations are prepared and presented to the host organism. Therefore, a high-quality characterization of an immunome must include the testing of multiple immunization protocols using antigens inoculated via different routes and doses, with the immune responses tested at different points in time (Assarsson et al., 2007) . Since it is nearly impossible to test all the potential antigen formulations and screen all the peptides that might induce responses, it is important to include in the immunome study reductionist approaches that are subjected to fewer variables. One of the most commonly used approaches is the biochemical MHC-peptide binding assay. The direct in vitro evaluation of peptides that can bind MHC molecules, as determined by competition assays, is likely to identify a larger pool of possible epitopes that would not actually bind in vivo, due to various processing and chaperone mechanisms, which are part of the immunodominant shaping mechanisms (Yewdell, 2006) .",

The 17D, 17D-213, and 17DD, YF strains used for human vaccination are products of multiple passages of the virulent parental Asibi virus (Galler et al., 1997) . The molecular basis of the attenuation has been identified, and all the vaccine strains have been shown to differ from the wild-type virus in a few amino acids (dos Santos et al., 1995; Galler et al., 1997; Jennings et al., 1993; Post et al., 1992) . The strain 17D has been successfully used worldwide for more than 65 years. It has an extraordinary record of safety, conferring long-lasting immunity for up to 35 years in as many as 99% of those vaccinated (Poland et al., 1981; World Health Organization, 2003) .",

A detectable T cell response was observed in both mice groups with the high and low doses 14 days after the first immunization (Supplemental Fig. 1A and B). The second immunization led to a more focused T cell response to fewer 16mer peptides (Supplemental Figs. 1C and D) and the third immunization did not change the pattern observed after the second immunization (Supplemental Fig. 1E and F). The evaluation of the humoral response after each immunization (data not shown) indicated that after two immunizations with either the high or low dose of the vaccine, both groups reached similar levels of IgG anti-YF (ELISA with virus lysate), and that the third immunization did not enhance the antibody levels. The results of these experiments (Supplemental Fig. 1 ) indicated that an immunization protocol with two low dosed of the 17DD YF vaccine given three weeks apart would be enough to induce an optimal T cell response, and hence, such protocol was applied in the subsequent experiments, except when indicated.",

It suggests that, in animals immunized with the 17DD YF vaccine, peptides E 332-340 and E 330-338 may be stimulating different populations of CD8 + T cells. The CD8 + T cell population activated by E 332-340 seems to be smaller in number, but with a higher avidity for its MHC-peptide complex then the CD8 + T cell population stimulated by E 330-338 . In these conditions, it is possible that two partially overlapping class I epitopes exist. However, we cannot discard the hypothesis that the in vivo processing and availability of these two epitope are different after the immunization with the 17DD YF vaccine, leading to the priming and generation of different numbers of CD8 + T cell clones with distinct MHC-peptide affinities.",

Here, we used PRED BALB/c after our ELISPOT and binding experiments in order to evaluate how well the software would perform in anticipating the positive peptides, as well as in avoiding testing of peptides that did not induce a positive response. Thus, we evaluated the performance of PRED BALB/c to predict possible binders to all the H2 d alleles (D d , K d , L d , I-A d , and I-E d ). We subjected the list of 120 15mer peptides from the envelope protein of the 17DD YF virus (Supplemental Table 2 ) to PRED BALB/c prediction analysis for class I and class II alleles, independently. It is important to note that in our simulation, the use of either the list of 15mers or the whole sequence of the envelope protein rendered comparable results, possibly due to the high degree of coverage offered by the scheme of 15 amino acids overlapping 11 (Kiecker et al., 2004) .",

It has previously been demonstrated that peptides of 8 to 10 amino acids can bind H2 b class I alleles (H2-K b and -D b ) (Moutaftsi et al., 2006) , and likely this is also true for H2 d class I alleles. The ELISPOT assays using decreasing in vitro concentrations of peptides may provide a measure of the avidity between the MHC-peptide complex and the TCR (Hesse et al., 2001) . At the same time, this approach can indirectly reflect the affinity of the TCR-peptide interaction (Hesse et al., 2001) , which can lead to distinct cell responses, as well as to different degrees of activation (Wilson et al., 2004) . Our results showed that 9mer E 60-68 not only induced the highest number of IFN-\u03b3 SFC but also had the highest dose-response curve, indicating a very high avidity for the MHC-peptide[E 60-68 ]:TCR complex in 17DD YF vaccine immunized mice. Peptide E 64-72 showed an intermediate level of avidity, while all the other 9mers had a very low avidity, supporting the conclusion that the results can be dependent on the in vitro peptide concentration used in the ELISPOT assays. However, a biological role for the responses that were observed only at high in vitro concentrations cannot be disregarded. The additional binding data showed that peptide E 60-68 indeed bound the class I allele H2-K d with very high affinity and that the adjoining peptides, E 59-67 and E 61-69 , also had a high affinity for H2-K d , despite the fact that they showed a low dose-response curve in the ELISPOT assays.",

This peptide also failed to induce a strong immune response when used directly in immunization protocols, and its recognition was inhibited when the immunization was performed in the presence of other peptides covering the adjacent amino acid sequences (Fig. 5H) . Moreover, E 330-338 also had a low affinity in the binding assay. On the other hand, peptide E 332-340 , which activated about half of the number of IFN-\u03b3 SFC induced by E 330-338 , showed a very high ELISPOT avidity curve in 17DD YF vaccine immunized mice and had very high affinity for H2-L d , as determined in the binding assays. Furthermore, peptide E 332-340 was able to induce a very strong and dominant immune response when used directly in the immunization protocol with adjuvant (Fig. 4D) . These results point out the benefits of performing ELISPOT assays with different concentrations of peptides, after a first round of screening. This approach can identify peptides that only induce responses at high concentration, as well as evaluate the peptide avidity.",

In our hands, the software showed to be very sensitive, predicting almost all positive peptides. However, the ability of the software to eliminate negative peptides was low and, if used before the ELISPOT assays, it would have avoided the testing of only about onequarter of the 120 15mers of the YF envelope protein. In another system, given a list of 41 peptides from the nucleoprotein of the SARS coronavirus, PRED BALB/c predicted 17 peptides with possible class II epitopes, and two peptides were found to be positive by in vitro epitope mapping (Zhao et al., 2007) . Taken together, these results suggest that the PRED BALB/c prediction algorithm is indeed very sensitive, but its specificity still needs to be improved. Fig. 6 . Venn diagram representation of results obtained from ELISPOT assay binding assay, and PRED BALB/c prediction. (A) ELISPOT results with 120 15mer peptides from the envelope of the YF virus with CD8-depleted splenocytes; PRED BALB/c was used to analyze the 120 15mer peptides from the envelope for the presence of class II (I-A d and I-E d ) binders; \u204eonly the seventeen peptides positive by ELISPOT were analyzed by binding assays for class II molecules, and those showing an IC 50 b1000 nM were considered possible binders. (B) ELISPOT results for the 3 out of 28 15mer peptides from the capsid of the YF virus that were considered positive with CD8-depleted splenocytes; PRED BALB/c was used to analyze the 28 15mer peptides from the capsid for the presence of class II (I-A d and I-E d ) binders; all 28 15mers from the capsid were tested in binding assays for class II molecules, and those showing an IC 50 b1000 nM were considered possible binders. (C) ELISPOT results with the 16 15mer peptides from the membrane of the YF virus with CD8-depleted splenocytes; PRED BALB/c was used to analyze the 16 15mer peptides from the membrane for the presence of class II (I-A d and I-E d ) binders; all 16 were tested in binding assays for class II molecules, and those showing an IC 50 b1000 nM were considered possible binders. (D) ELISPOT results for the 18 9mers from the envelope of the YF virus tested with CD4-depleted splenocytes; PRED BALB/c was used to analyze the 18 9mer for the presence of class II (I-A d and I-E d ) binders; all 9mers were tested in binding assays for class I molecules, and those showing an IC 50 b 500 nM were considered possible binders. The intersection represents the number of peptides that were positive in two or three of the approaches. In conclusion, the results of our epitope mapping of the three structural proteins of the YF virus in BALB/c (H2 d ) mice suggest that initial computational screening with high thresholds, followed by peptide screening of ELISPOT responses in immunized hosts and by binding assays, may prove to be the most efficient strategy for epitope discovery and analysis. In addition, the results presented here have the potential to identify novel correlates for YF protection in a mouse strain that is commonly used for the validation of YF vaccines.",

Experiments for evaluation of CD4 and CD8 responses were performed with CD8-or CD4-depleted cells, following the procedures from Miltenyi Microbeads kits (Miltenyi, Auburn, California, USA), using LD columns. IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assays were performed by using an ELISPOT set from BD-Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Initially, the ELISPOT plates were coated with anti-IFN-\u03b3 at 5 \u03bcg/mL and incubated at 4\u00b0C/overnight. The plates were blocked with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS for 2 h at room temperature, and either total splenocytes (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/well) or CD8-or CD4-depleted cells (0.5-1.0 \u00d710 6 cells/ well) from immunized mice were then added.

After 16 h of culture, the plates were washed and incubated with biotinylated anti-IFN-\u03b3 for 2 h at room temperature, followed by HRPconjugated avidin for 1 h at room temperature. Reactions were developed with AEC substrate (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation, San Diego, CA). Final enumeration of IFN-\u03b3 SFC was performed using the Immunospot Series 3B Analyzer ELISPOT reader (Cellular Technologies Ltd, Shaker Heights, OH) with aid of the Immunospot software version 3.0 (Cellular Technologies Ltd). The data indicate the number of spot-forming cells (SFC)/10 6 cells. The results were considered positive if the number of SFC was above 20 and higher than the background (culture with medium alone) plus three standard deviations. The results are presented after subtraction of the background, which was consistently found to be 10 to 35 spots/ 10 6 cells throughout the experiments.",

Briefly, 0.1 to 1 nM of a known MHCbinding radiolabeled peptide was co-incubated at room temperature with varying amounts of unlabeled test peptides, 1 \u00b5M to 1nM H-2 molecules purified by affinity chromatography, a cocktail of protease inhibitors and, for class I assays, 1 \u00b5M human \u00df2-microglubulin (Scripps Laboratories, San Diego, CA). After 2-day incubation, MHCpeptide complexes were captured on Lumitrac 600 microplates (Greiner Bio-one, Longwood, FL) coated with monoclonal antibody 28-14-8S, SF1-1.1.1, 34-5-8S, MKD6 or 14.4.4 for L d , K d , D d , I-A d and I-E d , respectively. Bound radioactivity was measured using a TopCount microscintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT). The concentration of peptide yielding 50% inhibition of the binding of the radiolabeled probe peptide (IC 50 ) was then calculated. Peptides were typically tested at six different concentrations covering a 100,000-fold dose range, and in three or more independent assays. Under the conditions utilized, where [label] b [MHC] and IC 50 \u2265 [MHC], the measured IC50 values are reasonable approximations of the KD values. The peptides used for binding assays were typically \u226580% pure (Supplemental Tables 2, 3 , 4, and 5).",

It utilizes quantitative matrices that have been validated using experimentally determined binders and non-binders and also by in vivo studies using viral proteins to score and rank proteic sequences of nine amino acids according to their predicted peptide binding to BALB/c major histocompatibility complex (H2 d ) class I (H2-K d , -D d and -L d ) and class II (I-E d and I-A d ) molecules (41). This software analyzes the sequence of each peptide and scores each one according to the known binding motifs identified for each allele throughout a core sequence of nine amino acids within the peptide sequence. The software supplies a list of all the peptides, ranked from 10 to 0, for each one of the five alleles of H2 d . An additional software feature allows the use of a threshold, which can be defined by the user.",
