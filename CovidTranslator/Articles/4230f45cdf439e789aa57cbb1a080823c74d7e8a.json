In the United States in 2013, pneumonia was responsible for 1.1 million hospital admissions and 53,282 deaths [2] . Pneumonia is commonly caused by viral or bacterial pathogens with the former being responsible for 29-39% of cases [3, 4] . Clinical signs and symptoms associated with the two etiologies are often indistinguishable [5] . Despite the advances in and clinical application of such diagnostic technologies, it has been reported that many patients nonetheless continue to receive antibiotic therapy without regard to positive viral PCR and/or low PCT results [14] [15] [16] . It was our objective to determine the frequency of changes in empiric antibiotic therapy for known or proven cases of pneumonia once results of respiratory panels (RP) and/or PCT testing were known to the clinician and thus determine the need for an active stewardship intervention at our own institution.",

            "text": "One possible explanation for the low rates of antibiotic discontinuation could relate to the relatively low prescribing of antibiotics (38.9%) to patients with proven or suspected respiratory infections which had either a low PCT, a positive viral RP result, or both. We believe the relatively low incidence of prescribing in this context suggests many prescribers avoided antibiotic therapy based on other clinical factors suggesting a non-bacterial illness causing respiratory symptoms. An earlier study by Falsey and colleagues of respiratory illness reflected similar results to ours substantiating the opportunity for more judicious antimicrobial use based on the results of RP and PCT [14] . In this single-center study, patients were deemed to have a pure viral infection if a viral test was positive, all bacterial tests were negative, and serum PCT levels were\\0.25 lg/mL on admission and day two of hospitalization. Duration of inpatient antibiotics was found to be significantly less in the viral alone group as compared to the mixed viral-bacterial group with means of 4.2 vs 6.2 days, respectively. These data suggest an opportunity in the use of combining RP and PCT results to narrow the etiologic diagnosis and perhaps decrease unnecessary antibiotic exposure.",

It is also notable, however, that while RP and PCT results suggesting pure viral infections resulted in shorter durations of antibiotic therapy, the average duration of therapy extended more than 2 days beyond the availability results of RP and PCT testing. Recently, in a follow-up study, antibiotic prescribing patterns associated with low PCT and positive viral RP results in patients with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections were characterized into two groups of patients, one receiving standard of care and the second receiving care specified by use of PCT algorithms and viral testing [15] . The investigators observed antibiotic discontinuation rates of 57% when PCT was\\0.25 lg/mL and a positive viral RP was reported. This was substantially different than the 10% antibiotic discontinuation rate we observed. Several differences in study methods likely explain these disparate results.",

Advances in diagnostic technologies such as respiratory panels (RP) utilizing polymerase chain reactions to detect viruses and determination of procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations may aid in this differentiation. However, some studies have shown limited impact for this purpose and thus continuation of antibiotics despite results suggesting viral infection. Our objective was to characterize clinician-prescribing behavior at our institution once RP and/or PCT results were known and suggestive of a viral respiratory infection. Methods: This retrospective analysis was based upon records of hospitalized patients in whom proven or possible respiratory infections as indicated by RP testing, respiratory bacterial culture or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 9th revision codes for acute infectious respiratory illness was documented. Patients evaluated were required to have a RP or PCT within the first 72 h of presentation.

The average daily census rate is 627, with over 36,000 annual admissions. Average adult inpatient length of stay, age and case-mix index are 6.2 days, 52 years, and 1.9642, respectively. A hospital's case-mix index represents the average diagnosis-related group (DRG) relative weight for that hospital. It is calculated by summing the DRG weights for allMedicare discharges and dividing by the number of discharges. It is used in determining the allocation of resources to care for and/or treat the patients in the group. This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at our institution.

Finally, to fully characterize the true impact of PCT and PCR on antibiotic prescribing, comparisons would need to include all patients with PCR and PCT results, not only those patients with results suggestive of mono-microbial viral respiratory infections.We believe that there are several potential clinical implications of our findings. While 2031 patients had proven or presumed respiratory tract infections, only 295 patients had both RP and PCT testing. The challenge of co-infections with viruses and bacteria denotes the need for respiratory infection protocols including both PCT and RP tests ordered in the emergency department or upon admission to ensure prompt results for assistance in the clinical decision-making process and the appropriate use of antibiotics. The combined use of these tests upon admission could have decreased antibiotic use by an average of 2 days in most patients in our study with a positive viral RP, a PCT\\0.25 lg/L, or both. Given issues with PCT sensitivity, it would appear prudent that both tests be employed. With the low rate of antibiotic discontinuation in the setting of positive viral RP and\\0.25 lg/mL PCT results, there appears to be a need for education of providers. This education should include reviewing the etiologies of respiratory tract infections, providing PCT testing and interpretation information, and the need for judicious use of antibiotics related to potential complications and resistance development. RP algorithms, and proactively recommend antibiotic discontinuation based upon proper interpretation of PCT and RP test results.",
