From independently owned pharmacies to corporately owned chain pharmacies, a variety of pharmacies are in operation. In some developing countries in Africa and Asia, the terms \"drug outlets,\" \"retail drug outlets,\" \"retail drug shops,\" and \"private pharmacies\" are commonly used. Community pharmacists must strategically position themselves in the community to serve the public health. Community pharmacies can be found on main streets, in malls and supermarkets, at the heart of the most rural villages, and in the center of the most deprived communities. In some countries, many community pharmacies are opened early and closed late when other healthcare professionals are unavailable (CPNI, no date). According to WHO (1994) , among healthcare providers, community pharmacists are the most accessible to the public. In practice, a pharmacy provides medications and other healthcare products and services and helps people and society make the best use of them (Wiedenmayer et al., 2006) . Community pharmacists supply, dispense, and sell medications according to the law. A proper dispensing practice will interpret and evaluate a prescription; select and manipulate or compound a pharmaceutical product; and label and supply the product in an appropriate container according to legal and regulatory requirements (WHO, 1994) . In addition, pharmacy activities include a pharmacist's provision of information and instructions to patients, and, under a pharmacist's supervision, practices will ensure the patient's safe and effective use of the medicines.",

The intervention that has empowered pharmacists to serve as client advocates and client counselors has identified a few improvements, such as knowledge, behavior, increased client satisfaction, and pharmacist-healthcare provider relationships. Pharmacists can move beyond the traditional role of selling drugs to be more effective healthcare professionals, and they need continuing professional development (CPD) (Minh, Huong, Byrkit, & Murray, 2013) .",

            "text": "Studies have reported that community pharmacists in developing countries, especially LMICs, do not provide quality services. A quick look at 19 developing countries shows that the community pharmacy practice setting is regarded as popular. Unfortunately, this practice setting also presents some concerns. For example, some countries allow nonpharmacists to operate pharmacies and to handle medicines. In some countries, the practice of community pharmacy is not well regulated, with little to no minimum standard of practice (Hussain, Mohamed Ibrahim, & Zaheer, 2012d) . Many pharmacy personnel who dispense medicines are unqualified, with no college/university diploma or professional degree in pharmacy (Lenjisa, Mosisa, Woldu, & Negassa, 2015) . A study in Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (Gokcekus, Toklu, Demirdamar, & Gumusel, 2012) reported that the pharmacy employees have no pharmacybased training and that pharmacists believed that their employees are capable to handle the prescriptions. Studies in Qatar, Pakistan, Malaysian, and Sudan have indicated that dispensing and labeling practices and provider-patient interactions are poor (Alamin Hassan, Mohamed Ibrahim, & Hassali, 2014; Hussain & Mohamed Ibrahim, 2011; Hussain et al., 2012d; Mohamed Ibrahim et al., 2014; Osman, Ahmed Hassan, & Mohamed Ibrahim, 2012) . In addition, a few dispensing errors have been identified (Lenjisa et al., 2015) . According to Basak, Arunkumar, and Masilamani (2009) , community pharmacy services in India are quite problematic, and the pharmacy's role in healthcare remains unrecognized. These authors have called for reform to meet societal needs. A study in Nigeria found that some community pharmacists often administer injections for customers-in some cases, without a prescription. The number of prescriptions that community pharmacists receive is low. They suffer from the limited availability of some resources, which has a serious impact on their practice (Adje & Oli, 2013) . A review of community pharmacy practices showed that, in some countries, pharmacy outlets were run by nonpharmacists; dispensing practices were unsatisfactory; drug sellers' level of knowledge regarding diseases and medicines was poor; medicines were used irrationally; pharmacies were not meeting the government's licensing requirements; medication storage conditions were improper; and customers could hardly meet with pharmacists (Hussain, Mohamed Ibrahim, & Babar, 2012a , 2012b , 2012d Hussain & Mohamed Ibrahim, 2012) . A study on over-the-counter (OTC) counseling in Brazil (Halila, Junior, Otuki, & Correr, 2015) concluded that even though the most important factors taken into account when counseling an OTC medicine were drug's efficacy and adverse effects, but only few pharmacists knew the meaning of terms related to evidence-based health. Poudel, Subish, Mishra, Mohamed Ibrahim, and Jayasekera (2010) reported that unregistered fixed-dose combinations of pharmaceutical products (e.g., antimicrobial combinations, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug combinations, and antimotility combinations) have been found in Nepali healthcare facilities, including drug outlets. Regarding prescription behavior, even in rural areas of India, the proportion of brand name prescriptions was high (Aravamuthan, Arputhavanan, Subramaniam, & Chander, 2017) .",

Pharmacists should be both health generalists and health specialists, which will have an impact on public health. Even the American Public Health Association (1981) supports the pharmacists' role in public health. Should community pharmacists move beyond their traditional role? Even when dispensing medicines through paper-based prescription services, pharmacists should comply with some fundamental standards. Safety issues must be considered when dispensing medications. The Pharmacy Board of Australia published guidelines for medication dispensing (i.e., guidelines for scanned and faxed prescriptions and steps to take when handling Internet or mail-order dispensing); guidelines for dispensing extemporaneous medications; guidelines when handling errors (e.g., dispensing errors); guidelines for appropriate medication labeling; guidelines for patient counseling, privacy, and confidentiality; and pharmacy technicians' functions, responsibilities, and competencies (Pharmacy Board of Australia, n.d.). In addition, for pharmacies that use electronic and computer systems, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (n.d.) has provided several guidelines and principles for good dispensing and appropriate dispensing procedures (e.g., professional checking, medication substitution, and labeling). Malaysia, a developing country, has also developed Guide to Good Dispensing Practice (Malaysian Pharmaceutical Services Division, 2016) . These guidelines aim to have both public and private facilities dispensing medications according to the law and guidelines, which may ensure that patients receive the correct medications, adherence is improved, adverse effects are minimized, and errors are avoided. The document's contents relate to processing prescriptions, preparing medications, labeling, recoding, and issuing medications to the patient. In geographical areas where no pharmacists are available, a guide about managing medicines would be a handy document indeed (Andersson & Snell, 2010) .",

Outcomes refer to the consequences (results) of interventions that are made to achieve therapeutic goals. Outcomes can have economic, social/behavioral, or physiological characteristics.

The pharmacist's function as a researcher has since evolved, and all these roles have been addressed in the competence standards (WHO, 1997, pp. 27-29) . Community pharmacists have to make efforts to move from being drug compounders and dispensers to being pharmaceutical care providers and medication experts; their role and function should focus on patient-centered care rather than products and profits. Community pharmacists must equip themselves with adequate knowledge and skills and be responsible for ensuring that, irrespective of the medications provided and used, quality products are selected, procured, stored, distributed, dispensed, and administered to enhance patients' health and do them no harm. Relevant pharmacy authorities should provide more support, training, and development for community pharmacies to help their pharmacists deliver high-quality services. Pharmacy associations could organize programs in collaboration with pharmacy colleges and could involve regional or international experts if affordable. Nonprofit international organizations, such as WHO and Management Sciences for Health (MSH), could assist LMICs in this matter. In addition, some chain pharmacies could implement monthly programs. Community pharmacists must be involved in CPD; individual pharmacists are responsible for the systematic maintenance, development, and broadening of their knowledge, skills, and attitudes to ensure their continued competence as professionals throughout their careers. Community pharmacists (with the help of academics from pharmacy colleges, if required) must conduct research to document outcomes and impacts (e.g., accessibility, effectiveness, and positive perceptions of the experience); research must be conducted to assess the minimum standards and quality of community pharmacies and to provide evidence-based practice information. The numbers of published studies from developing countries are very low compared with those from developed countries. Managerial and educational interventions are needed to improve the practice. Community pharmacists could obtain inputs/ideas and explore the perceptions of community pharmacy staff-in addition to customers and patients-regarding aspects of service quality. These inputs could then perhaps be used to improve the services offered to customers. Some pharmacists are able to use information technology to enhance pharmacy and pharmaceutical services; pharmacists in some other countries find doing it so problematic-due to a very basic infrastructure or the lack of basic competencies, among others. Finally, WHO (Wiedenmayer et al., 2006) and other sources have provided a guide and systematic approach for delivering pharmacy patient-centered care and good pharmacy and dispensing practice.",

Customers now demand better quality care and more attention to maintain or improve their overall health. Evidence has shown that challenges and gaps exist in community pharmacy practice.
