Physical examination often reveals effusions. Estimation of skin turgor and thickness of lip folds, conjunctiva, and tarsal webs detects localized edema or whole-body edema (i.e., anasarca). Some effusions can be difficult to recognize without diagnostic imaging (radiographic or ultrasonographic). Abdominal effusion can be missed during palpation (balloting a fluid wave has poor predictive value). Small volumes of pleural fluid usually escape physical detection. In almost all cases, analysis of the fluid causing the effusion is crucial to proper categorization and determination of cause.",

Anorexia and emaciation alone do not produce hypoalbuminemia severe enough to elicit edema or effusion. Check for pathologic proteinuria (see Chapter 7) and hepatic insufficiency (see the discussion of bile acids in Chapter 9). Remember: PLE may occur without signs of enteric disease; enteric biopsy may be needed for diagnosis. Serum cholesterol concentration (see Chapter 8) is helpful; PLE and hepatic failure usually cause hypocholesterolemia, whereas PLN usually causes hypercholesterolemia. Involvement of portal hypertension as a pathomechanism of abdominal effusion can be discerned by measuring the serum albumin-effusion albumin (SA-EA) gradient; values greater than 1.1 suggest portal hypertension.

Biliary tree perforation may be immediate or delayed after blunt or surgical injury (see Table 10 -3). Affected animals usually have low-grade abdominal pain, lethargy, fever, jaundice, and abdominal effusion. Pale or acholic feces indicate deviation of bile from the intestines. Serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate transferase (AST) activities are invariably increased. The appearance and severity of jaundice depends on the underlying cause and chronicity of biliary tree rupture. Initially there may be large volumes of fluid with few clinical signs. Exposure of cell membranes to bile acids and lysolecithin promotes the transmural migration of enteric microbes causing peritonitis. Sometimes focal bile peritonitis is contained by the omentum. If a pocket of fluid is found ultrasonographically, it can be aspirated using a spinal needle to confirm the diagnosis. A ruptured gallbladder may not be well visualized ultrasonographically. Diffuse bile peritonitis is usually cytologically obvious: high numbers of neutrophils and macrophages plus free and engulfed bile.

Higher bilirubin concentration in the effusion than in serum is common, but this determination is usually unnecessary for diagnosis. Fluid samples for accurate diagnosis of bile peritonitis are collected from the immediate area of leakage. Uroabdomen occurs when urine leaks and pools in the peritoneal cavity. Affected animals sometimes have apparently normal voiding (e.g., a single ruptured ureter; a bladder avulsion when a fibrous tract permits voiding into the urethral lumen). Avulsion of a ureter at the renal pedicle causes retroperitoneal fluid accumulation. Trauma is the major cause, but cystocentesis or neoplasia may be responsible. The degree of azotemia varies; if virtually all urine produced accumulates in the abdomen, rapid onset of azotemia is expected. Most patients develop a vaguely painful abdomen, lethargy, fever, and dehydration. Markedly increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations, hyperphosphatemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis are expected. The effusion is slightly turbid, blood-tinged, and yellow. Fluid creatinine concentration is markedly higher than peripheral blood creatinine. No substantial difference is found in the fluid and serum urea nitrogen concentrations because of the very small size of the urea molecule and dispersion in body water. An intravenous (IV) urogram (followed by a retrograde urethral cystogram, if necessary) locates the damaged area. Urinary drainage and abdominal lavage rapidly corrects electrolyte and acid-base derangements.",

Physical examination may disclose underlying disease (e.g., gallop rhythm, cardiac murmur, loss of normal compression of the anterior chest in cats with an enlarged heat or mediastinal mass). Trauma plus a vague \"emptiness\" of the abdomen and auscultation of borborygmi in the thorax suggests diaphragmatic hernia; dogs with right-sided cardiac failure usually develop ascites, and cats often form pleural effusion with cardiac failure. Benign or neoplastic pericardial effusion, constrictive or restrictive pericarditis, and right atrial hemangiosarcoma cause pleural effusion associated with pericardial tamponade in dogs. Occasionally, animals with a cranial mediastinal mass and associated pleural effusion have cranial vena cava syndrome (i.e., submandibular edema, jugular engorgement and pulses, injection of the conjunctival blood vessels indicating impaired cranial venous return, lymphatic return, or both). Thymomas, thymic cysts, lymphoma, invasive thyroid adenocarcinoma, and jugular thrombosis are the most common causes of this syndrome. Thoracic radiography should be performed before thoracocentesis to minimize the possibility of iatrogenic lung laceration, to disclose cardiomegaly (suggesting cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion), and to detect gas entrapped within visceral structures (i.e., diaphragmatic hernia) or abscess. Removing the effusion followed by radiography may permit identification of masses and consolidated lung lobes. Thoracic ultrasonography is enhanced by voluminous thoracic effusion; ultrasound-guided aspiration of masses may provide a definitive diagnosis. Most animals require sedation before needletargeted thoracic sampling of lesions deeper than the peripheral pleural space. Thoracic exudates (Figure 10-6 ; see Figure 10 -4) necessitate cytologic examination for infectious organisms. Pasteurella multocida is the most common reported aerobic isolate. Actinomyces and Nocardia are often found in dogs. Multiple bacterial species are common in feline pyothorax. Septic exudates typically are turbid, cream-colored, or seropurulent and contain degenerate WBCs with or without multiple bacterial forms. Exudates associated with pure Actinomyces infection may have minimal or no WBC degeneration; dual infections with Nocardia are common, and mixed populations of organisms may be found in thick or thin red-brown exudates containing degenerate WBCs and \"sulfur granules.\" Including colored flecks from the exudate on smears improves cytologic visualization of actinomycosis-nocardiosis. These organisms are presumptively diagnosed when beaded, branching filaments (Color Plates 4B and 4C) are found. Most Nocardia spp. stain acid fast with a modified acid-fast stain; Actinomyces spp. do not. Both organisms produce exudates containing sulfur granules, but only Actinomyces produces these within tissue. Thoracic radiography in animals with pyothorax may disclose pulmonary parenchymal involvement. Effusions persist as long as a chest tube is retained. Sequential evaluation of cytologic specimens can be used to estimate patient response to treatment and guide the propriety of tube removal.",

Modified transudates are found with right-sided heart failure, pericardial cysts, and uremic pericarditis. Exudates are found with FIP, bacterial pericarditis, and coccidioidomycosis. Septic pericarditis is rare. Chylopericardium is rare but may develop consequent to mediastinal venous hypertension (e.g., cardiomyopathy).

Joint pain may be subtle; joints should be carefully palpated for mobility, swelling, and discomfort. Synovial fluid analysis distinguishes noninflammatory from inflammatory conditions; examination of joint fluid may be helpful in animals with fever of unknown origin. Many immune-mediated diseases involve joints. Very small amounts of fluid are available from most normal joints; therefore, collecting relatively large volumes suggests effusion. Acute and inflammatory conditions cause effusion, whereas chronic and noninflammatory disorders produce joint enlargement due to soft tissue swelling but yield little fluid. If arthrocentesis is performed to evaluate fever or unexplained lameness in an animal without swollen joints, at least two or three joints should be sampled (carpal and tarsal usually preferred).",

Normal synovial fluid has a \"sticky\" viscosity forming a viscous strand when dripped from a needle. Viscosity is reduced in most types of joint effusion. If small amounts of fluid are obtained, however, smears to determine relative cellularity and the predominant cell type are the first priority. Cytology usually discloses if inflammation is present.

Nonerosive arthritides are more difficult to definitively diagnose and categorize. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and arthritis associated with a variety of underlying diseases are more common. Ragocytes, lupus erythematosus (LE) cells, or both indicate immune-mediated disease (see Color Plate 5A). Submission of sera for antinuclear antibody (AN) and rheumatoid factor titers (see Chapter 12), blood for LE cell preparations, and synovial biopsies for histologic evaluation may implicate immunodestructive processes. Chronic, progressive feline polyarthritis usually occurs in males and has two forms. The periosteal-proliferative form is most prevalent, primarily affecting young adult cats and causing tenosynovitis followed by nondeforming periarticular periosteal proliferation and subchondral bone erosions. The deforming or rheumatoidlike arthritis form has an insidious onset in older cats and is associated with severe subchondral bone destruction, joint instability, and deformity. Feet, carpi, and tarsi are severely and symmetrically affected. Table 10 The most common cause of noninflammatory joint disease is degenerative arthritis because of trauma or joint instability. Other causes include hemarthrosis, neoplasia, genetic or developmental disorders, dietary or nutritional deficiencies or excesses, and miscellaneous causes (e.g., hypertrophic osteopathy).",

Patients with generalized edema from vasculitis usually have perivascular hemorrhage (i.e., petechial hemorrhages, microhematuria) or microangiopathic effects (i.e., schistocytes). Total body water retention because of inappropriate elaboration of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (see Chapter 6) coexists with other disorders that overshadow its presence. Retention of sodium because of increased renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone occurs in patients with severe renal, hepatic, or cardiac disease having hypoalbuminemia. Systemic hypertension often occurs when the renin-angiotensin axis is the primary abnormality. History, physical examination, serum albumin determination, thoracic radiographs, cardiac evaluations (i.e., ECG, echocardiography), CVP determinations, and urinalysis assist in confirming the cause of anasarca (see Figure 10 -9). Finding a jugular pulse or abnormal hepatojugular reflex suggests intrathoracic disease. If an underlying cause is not found, physical examination and laboratory data are reviewed looking for evidence of vasculitis (i.e., petechiation, fundic examination for microvascular lesions, microscopic hematuria, blood smear looking for schistocytes). Skin biopsies performed in areas of bruising or cutaneous lesions should be taken to investigate vasculitis.

Unfortunately, many dogs with septic joints have minimal to no degenerative neutrophils. Concurrent antibiotic therapy may cause underestimation of infection because of suppression of degenerative neutrophil changes, suppressed numbers of organisms, and negative culture results. Some agents may not cause degenerative neutrophils and are not cytologically detectable (e.g., mycoplasma, rickettsia, L-form bacteria, viruses [calicivirus in cats, postvaccinal arthritides]). Most canine polyarthritis is nonspecifically immune-mediated. Feline polyarthritis (i.e., chronic progressive polyarthritis) is linked (statistically) with feline syncytiumforming virus (FeSFV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection. If minimal amounts of fluid are aspirated, the syringe and needle can be rinsed with broth-enrichment media and this rinse cultured; synovial fluid preincubated in blood culture media for 24 hours also may yield more positive cultures. In chronic low-grade infections, culturing synovial tissue biopsies may be more productive than synovial fluid culture. If synovial fluid infection is present, blood and urine cultures plus echocardiography are reasonable next steps. Omphalophlebitis may be the source of infection in young animals. Serologic testing for borreliosis (i.e., Lyme disease) may help diagnose inflammatory arthritis of unknown cause; however, interpretation of 264 Small Animal Clinical Diagnosis by Laboratory Methods ",
