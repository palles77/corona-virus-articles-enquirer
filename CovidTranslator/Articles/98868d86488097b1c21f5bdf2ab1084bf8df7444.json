[14] [15] [16] In terms of environmental risk factors for CDI, longer lengths of stay 6 and hospital units with more colonization pressure (higher rates of cases) are associated with CDI. 17 When considering environmental CDI risk factors, the environment is usually defined at a local level-as a unit 17 or a room. 14, 18 For example, the risk for CDI is higher for a patient occupying a room where a previous occupant had CDI. 18 However, patients travel to different rooms, to different units, and also to different hospitals. Thus, perhaps, a more expansive definition of the environment is needed -a health-system-level risk factor -to take into account how hospitals are connected to other hospitals via patient transfers.",

Thus, patient sharing between hospitals may serve as a means for the dissemination of CDI and other healthcare-associated infections. Alternatively, patient transfers may indicate a level of increased severity of illness and thus hospitals with more transfers may be associated with a greater percentage of patients at risk for CDI, due to their underlying disease state. Although simulation studies have helped support the notion that healthcare-associated infections disseminate via patient transfers, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] to date, there has been less empirical work focused on measuring the potential for spreading healthcareassociated infections via patient transfers or specifically how the structure of transfer networks affects health care infection rates at included hospitals. The purpose of this paper is to determine if and to what extent the burden of CDI at hospitals is related to the hospital's connectivity to other hospitals.",

Because of the log link, we are predicting a multiplicative change in the incidence of a hospital (e.g., 3.3% increase). Consequently, the effect of an additive single unit increase in a predictor is not a constant increase in the mean number of cases but rather a constant multiplier of the mean baseline incidence.

However, if CDI rates are affected by connectivity, then risk adjustment models that consider only the factors at a given hospital will produce inaccurate results. If the connectivity and the behavior at the connections are outside of the influence of a hospital, imposition of penalties on that hospital may not bring about the desired result.

In addition, the spread of multi-drug resistant gram negatives has been documented 26, 27 and will continue to be an infection-control threat. Emerging infections can quickly spread through populations via healthcare environments, especially when patients that are colonized and/or in an asymptomatic phase of the disease are transferred. In addition, transferred patients may be symptomatic but undiagnosed. Transfers may dramatically affect the spread of diseases that are difficult to treat, e.g., Ebola. In 2003 SARS spread across hospitals in Toronto, and the transmission of the disease was maintained in healthcare facilities. 28 Understanding how healthcare workers move and interact with patients within hospitals can help inform both disease surveillance approaches and infection-control interventions. [29] [30] [31] [32] Understanding how patients move throughout a state will help inform both disease surveillance approaches and infection-control interventions for a wide range of infections. For example, in our hospital graph, the clustering identified three distinct clusters, yet all the clusters are also linked by hospital transfers. Some of the hospitals in our network are more likely to facilitate transfers that connect transfers than other hospitals. Thus, these are the hospitals that may be especially important to consider in terms of state-wide infectioncontrol efforts. Also, our results suggest that hospitals that are more connected are important to consider for surveillance.

Accordingly, higher CDI rates could be caused by a greater proportion of patients at a higher risk of developing CDI due to their underlying severity of illness.

Nor does it include drug data; e.g., antibiotics. However, our hospital identifier fixed effects partially serve to control for differences in diagnosing CDI and antibiotic use among hospitals. Third, we are only able to measure CDI cases that are either identified on admission or during a hospital stay. Clearly, many cases occur after a patient's stay. 33 Future work should explore alternative data sources with post-discharge information in an attempt to correctly attribute possible community cases to institutions and further investigate the role of a hospital's centrality as a risk factor for CDI. Fourth, network centrality is a risk factor for CDI primarily in only the more-connected hospitals. Finally, our modeling framework accommodates the heterogeneity among hospitals using fixed effects as opposed to random effects. Mixed effects models, based on the latter approach, were considered. However, mixed effects modelling requires the random effects be uncorrelated with the predictors. It is unlikely that the random effects are truly uncorrelated with the indegree of a hospital and, as such, mixed effects models would not accurately estimate the effect of indegree.
