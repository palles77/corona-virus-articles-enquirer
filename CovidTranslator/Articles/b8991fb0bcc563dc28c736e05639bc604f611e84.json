Results. One hundred three RTID episodes in 66 patients were identified (PIV 47% [48 of 103], RSV 32% [33 of 103], MPV 21% [22 of 103]). Episodes occurred in 85% (87 of 103) at >100 days post-HCT. Lower RTID accounted for 36% (37 of 103). Thirty-nine percent (40 of 103) of RTID episodes required hospitalization and more frequently affected patients with lower RTID. Six percent progressed from upper to lower RTID. Overall mortality was 6% and did not differ between paramyxoviruses. Sixty-one percent (63 of 103) of episodes occurred in patients with SID, and 20.2% (19 of 63) of episodes occurred in patients with verySID. Oral ribavirin plus intravenous immunoglobulin was administered in 38% (39 of 103) of RTIDs, preferably for RSV or MPV (P \u2264 .001) and for SID patients (P = .001). Patients with verySID frequently progressed to lower RTID (P = .075), required intensive care unit transfer, and showed higher mortality.",

Although the efficacy of RBV+IVIG has not been formally proven, some clinical experiences suggest that there might be a benefit if administered early and to patients at presumably highest risk for progression to lower RTID [10, 14] . In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate efficacy of RBV and IVIG for PIV and MPV [21] [22] [23] [24] . Some centers, including ours, consider RBV and IVIG treatment for PIV and MPV RTID in allogeneic HCT patients with clinical parameters suggesting severe immunodeficiency (SID), despite the lack of supporting studies [1, 3, 4, 16, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .

It is notable that lower RTID accounted for 36% of episodes, and most of these patients required admission. Thus, paramyxovirus RTID after allogeneic HCT continues to pose a significant clinical burden. Overall mortality was low, and indeed lower than compared with previous reports, and typically occurred in verySID patients having 2 and more SID criteria.

However, they may reflect differences in the study design of earlier studies that were limited to 100 days posttransplant as well as to changes in management of community-acquired respiratory virus infections such as deferral of HCT, consistent use of multiplex NAT for all symptomatic patients including outpatients, close follow-up, and the overall longer survival after HCT. A recent study also demonstrated that RTIDs continue to occur at high frequency in the late post-HCT phase after a median of 4 months [39] . Given that our patients were, for the most part, in hematological remission, return to a normal, less protected life with social contacts appears to be a plausible explaination for exposure to respiratory viruses within the first year after allogeneic HCT. Thus, awareness of the extended time of vulnerability emerging from this study as well as others may be an important observation for future antiviral and vaccine developments. This is also reflected in the recently completed trial of the RSV fusion inhibitor presatovir, in which patients presented with upper or lower RTID at 278 days (9.3 months) and 451 days (15 months) posttransplantation [40] .",

            "text": "Most of the RTID episodes in our center were managed without hospitalization, and patients had uncomplicated courses with low progression rates to lower RTID, absence of persisting airflow obstruction, and low mortality. This may be explained by a better, general clinical condition and partial immune reconstitution expected later post-HCT and is reflected by the lower number of patients with neutropenia and lymphopenia. In a recent study, Kim et al [19] identified that an absolute lymphocyte count >1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /liter at the time of upper RTID onset is protective regarding progression to lower RTID. This is in agreement with our data illustrating that only 1 of 54 patients with upper RTID and absolute lymphocyte count >1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /liter progressed to lower RTID. In contrast, a threshold of <0.1 \u00d7 10 9 /liter has been reported as a risk factor for progression [28, 41] and was adopted by our and earlier studies [10, 34] , whereas others proposed the closely related cutoff of 0.2 \u00d7 10 9 /liter [14] . Thus, low or very low lymphocyte counts are an important determinant of progression and outcome. The impact of treatment with RBV and/or IVIG on outcome cannot be ascertained in our study due to the lack of an appropriately sized, preferably randomized control group. However, Abbreviations: alloHCT, allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplantation; CI, confidence interval; HLA, human leucocyte antigen; OR, odds ratio; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; RTID, respiratory tract infectious disease; SID, severe immunodeficiency. a The model includes the following: lower RTID, alloHCT \u22646 months, hematological complete remission, and corrects for episodes among equal patients. Hosmer-Lemeshow \u03c7 2 = 0.15, P = .985. b SID criteria were defined as alloHCT \u22646 months ago, graft-versus-host-disease grade \u22652, leucopenia \u22641.0 \u00d7 10 9 /liter or neutropenia <0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /liter, lymphopenia \u22640.1 \u00d7 10 9 /liter or hypogammaglobulinemia <4.5 g/liter, or T-cell or B-cell depletion \u22643 months ago. such studies are difficult to conduct given ethical concerns and an operative protocol. This is also reflected in a recent study for presatovir, in which systemic RBV was not excluded, but rather patients were stratified according to its use. As first reported in 2008 [10] , systemic RBV and IVIG were consistently available at the discretion of the treating physician in our center together with internal guidance regarding their administration, supporting data only existing for RSV-RTID [14] . Accordingly, 61% of paramyxovirus RTID episodes were treated, and RBV+IVIG was mainly administered in RSV-and MPV-RTIDs, whereas IVIG alone was preferred for PIV RTID. In our study, the use of RBV was associated with hemolysis, leading to discontinuation of the drug typically after 3 to 5 days of therapy. Overall, we found a low complication rate of all paramyxoviruses regarding a number of important parameters such as progression from upper to lower RTID, need for hospitalization, fixed airflow obstruction after RTID resolution, as well as overall and virus-attributable mortality. Thus, the question arises whether SID and verySID patients, in particular, would have fared worse without treatment. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated the efficacy of aerosolized and systemic RBV, with or without immunomodulators, for RSV infections in patients after allogeneic HCT [9, 10, 14, 18, 42] . By contrast, the impact of systemic RBV for MPV-and PIV-RTIDs is undefined. In our study, treatment was more often provided in the setting of MPV infections than PIV infections. Although we did not observe a difference in progression to lower RTID or mortality, it seemed that the viral shedding was shorter for RBV-treated MPV infections, but this trend was not found for PIV.",

            "text": "In view of the unmet clinical need of paramyxovirus RTID after HCT and the undocumented efficacy, the following key questions remain: who should be treated, and should all paramyxovirus RTID be treated with RBV+IVIG? Until better, more specific, and more potent antiviral therapies become available, we conclude from our study that SID patients, particularly ver-ySID patients fulfilling 2 or more SID criteria, can be treated safely with systemic RBV+IVIG, whereas IVIG alone can be offered to such patients with PIV-RTID. Shah et al [43] recently identified risk factors for poor outcome of RSV-RTIDs after allogeneic HCT and proposed a scoring index from 1 to 10 to classify patients with low (score 0-2), moderate (score 3-6), and high risk (7-10) for progression to identify those who would benefit most from (inhaled RBV-based) antiviral therapy. Their proposed criteria are similar to ours but also introduced age \u226540 years, myeloablative conditioning regimen, and use of corticosteroids within the prior 30 days [43] . In our center, previously reported criteria have been reported some time ago and were available for use since then. As can be seen from the direct comparison, there is a substantial overlap (Supplementary  Table 4 ). Unfortunately, the score by Shah et al [43] is awaiting independent validation. Until further validation in a prospective setting is done, we will apply our simpler criteria of SID for respiratory virus RTID with essentially similar conclusions. Taken together, the data support the view that host immunodeficiency remains a major determinant of outcome, not only for RSV but also for MPV and PIV. Thus, there is a need to further validate such risk strata in prospective trials to balance treatment versus overtreatment and adverse events, particularly for MID HCT patients.",

First, the use of a comprehensive, specific, and sensitive diagnostic tests such as multiplex NAT facilitates diagnosis and initiation of timely treatment, and no screening is advocated in our center, which largely restrict diagnosis to symptomatic patients, and potentially late presentations, for which treatment may not readily modify outcome, as shown for influenza. Second, although we have standardized guidelines on therapeutic regimens for these infections in our hospital, its use was based on the discretion of the treating physician. Thus, more severe presentation may have been favored for treatment. Third, our study lacks a randomized control group to evaluate our treatment approach. The prospects of conducting such a trial for RBV have to await the results on currently ongoing trials testing more specifically designed new antivirals for RSV and hopefully other paramyxoviruses [44] . Finally, although we included a large cohort of hematologic patients, this was a single-center study and therefore our results might not be transferable to other centers. ",
