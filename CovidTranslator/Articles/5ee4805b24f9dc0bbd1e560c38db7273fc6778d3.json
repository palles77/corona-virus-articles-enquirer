A recent study demonstrated that West Nile virus infection of wild-type cells led to the induction of IRF3 target genes and ISgs, including several subtypes of IFN\u03b1 (ReF. 8) . This was followed by a second phase of IFN-dependent antiviral gene expression that occurred at a later stage of infection. By contrast, cells lacking RIg-I had delayed or inhibited initial and secondary gene-expression responses to the virus, indicating that RIg-I has an essential but not exclusive role in initiating innate immune responses to West Nile virus (FIG. 2) . The additional deletion of MDA5 in these cells was found to further block their ability to respond to infection, indicating that the host immune response to West Nile virus also involves MDA5. This is a noteworthy finding, as previous studies suggested that RIg-I and MDA5 recognized a specific subset of viruses, rather than acting cooperatively as found in the response to West Nile virus 9 .",

Similar to West Nile virus, genomic analysis of influenza virus-infected wild-type and RIg-I-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed that RIg-I is necessary for the type I IFN response to this virus (FIG. 2) . In RIg-I-deficient cells, influenza virus fails to elicit the expression of IFN\u03b2 and of many ISgs, including key antiviral mediators such as IRF3, STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), IFIT1 (IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1; also known as ISg56) and ISg54 (also known as IFIT2). This study also showed that, unlike during infection with West Nile virus, MDA5 does not function as a secondary mediator of the response to infection with influenza virus 10 . Important next steps in these studies will be to compare the profiles of genes induced by each of these viruses -and to determine whether some genes are specific for RIg-I or MDA5 signalling -and to begin to define the involvement of these genes in innate immunity. Although this biological validation process will be necessary to follow-up genomic analyses, few studies so far have included such experiments.",

            "text": "Today, the standard technology in functional genomics is the oligonucleotide microarray [111] [112] [113] . Several alternative platforms are available, with the most common being microarrays for which thousands of oligonucleotide 'probes', each corresponding to an mRNA transcript, are synthesized in situ directly on a glass slide. Such microarrays enable researchers to simultaneously measure the expression of virtually all genes in a genome. For 'target' preparation, mRNA is extracted from experimental samples and labelled with fluorescent dyes by reverse transcription. The labelled target is then hybridized with the microarray, and the fluorescence of the features is determined using an array scanner. Following image analysis, the data are subjected to a variety of bioinformatic processes to identify statistically significant changes in gene expression between samples. Because each comparison yields tens of thousands of data points, mining the data for biological meaning is a formidable challenge. A variety of sophisticated commercial and open-source analysis tools are therefore used to find relationships between differentially expressed genes, to identify networks or signalling pathways that are activated or repressed and to compare gene-expression profiles between experimental samples. envelope components of viruses and cell-surface components of bacteria (such as lPS)). A computational analysis of promoter sequences identified NF-\u03baB as the key regulator of the universal response, which occurs early after TlR stimulation, and the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) as the key component of the TlR3 and TlR4 response, which is induced after the NF-\u03baB response. This computational approach provided additional knowledge regarding the kinetics of the TlR3 and TlR4 response, the regulatory circuitry involved and the identity of the genes Figure 1 | Stimulation of interferon-stimulated gene expression and initiation of antiviral activity. Pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in viral proteins and nucleic acids are recognized by cellular pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) that include RIG-I (retinoic-acid-inducible gene I), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) and certain Toll-like receptors (TLRs). PRR-PAMP interactions trigger signalling cascades that result in the activation of transcription factors, including interferon (IFN)-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), which induce the production of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The specific process differs between antigen-presenting cells, in which both the TLR pathway and the RIG-I or MDA5 pathway are operative, and other cell types, in which only the RIG-I or MDA5 pathway is present. Activation of PRR signalling induces an antiviral state in all cell types, and in antigen-presenting cells it can also induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This normally results in an innate antiviral response that controls infection until it is resolved by the adaptive immune response. However, some viruses, such as the 1918 pandemic influenza virus, elicit an aberrant or disproportional response that results in immunopathology. Alternatively, viruses that suppress the type I IFN response can subvert the mechanisms of innate surveillance and diminish the potential adaptive immune response, resulting in a chronic infection. For vaccine strategies, the best induction of a broad adaptive immune response might require some degree of type I IFN response in the initial stages of infection.

The induction of ISg expression is observed in liver tissue from HCV-infected patients 30, 32, 37 and during the initial host response in acutely infected chimpanzees 26, 28 , and is a major part of the transcriptional response to HCV infection in the chimeric SCID-Alb/uPA mouse model 33 . This poses an interesting question about the source of both type I IFNs and ISg expression. It is possible that ISgs are mainly expressed in uninfected hepatocytes and are induced in response to exogenous type I IFN released from adjacent HCV-infected cells. Alternatively, it has been suggested that T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells that infiltrate the liver are a possible source of hepatic type I IFNs 37 . Although this is possible, it is relevant to note that HCV infection in the SCID-Alb/uPA mouse model is also associated with the induction of hepatic ISg expression in the absence of these immune cell types 33 .",

Highly virulent viruses, such as Zaire Ebola virus and Marburgvirus, inhibit the expression of most ISgs that are induced in uninfected IFN-treated cells. By contrast, the relatively non-pathogenic Reston Ebola virus is less inhibitory and induces the expression of more than 20% of these genes. The suppression of the type I IFN response by the pathogenic viruses is associated with more rapid viral spread and higher rate of viral replication than that observed during Reston Ebola virus infection.",

This study revealed that infection with an attenuated virus results in both inflammation and the induction of expression of key ISgs. However, these events are either absent or diminished during infection with a highly pathogenic rabies virus. On the basis of results with filoviruses, it would follow that attenuation of the type I IFN response would be associated with higher viral replication and spread in the case of pathogenic infection with rabies virus; however, this was not measured in the study. Similarly, infection with highly virulent pseudorabies virus suppressed the induction of a subset of ISgs, even in type I IFN-treated cells 40 . Together, these data suggest that the virulence of acute, highly pathogenic viruses is at least partially related to their ability to suppress the host antiviral response, which seems to allow higher levels of viral replication.",

Evidence discussed in this Review suggests that suppression of elements of the innate immune response enables extensive viral replication and increased pathogenesis. Does the converse hold true for a virus such as HCV, which typically establishes a persistent infection characterized by mild (or slowly progressing) disease? Some evidence suggests that this might be the case; for example, studies using the chimeric SCID-Alb/uPA mouse model indicate that an attenuated type I IFN response is associated with higher levels of intrahepatic HCV replication together with a greater induction of lipid metabolism and oxidative-stress genes, which have the potential to cause cytopathic effects 33 .",

It is possible that the selective pressures on persistent viruses never resulted in a need for a complete subversion of host innate antiviral responses, so such viruses use these responses to limit their replication to a level that does not significantly affect the normal functions of the host cell. Conversely, acute viruses, such as filoviruses, highly pathogenic influenza virus and rabies virus, seem to have evolved to antagonize these responses following cell entry to allow immediate, high levels of replication, which subsequently facilitate virus spread and transmission.",

First, contemporary and 1918 viruses each trigger an innate immune response that includes the expression of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 target genes, which is expected to occur if the virus triggers the RIg-I pathway in infected respiratory cells. Second, both viruses trigger a robust cytokine response that probably attracts immune-cell infiltration to infected tissues. unlike contemporary virus strains, in which the early response to infection is resolved, the innate immune response triggered by the 1918 virus is characterized by a strong and sustained induction that is associated with massive tissue damage and death of the infected animal. However, in preliminary genomic analyses carried out with lung tissue from macaques that were infected with avian H5N1 viruses, we have found that there are significant differences in the regulation of antiviral responses by the 1918 pandemic and H5N1 viruses (J. C. Kash and M.g.K., unpublished observations). Therefore, there may be differences in the ways in which highly pathogenic influenza viruses regulate the innate immune response and cause disease. The enhanced pathogenicity of the 1918 and H5N1 influenza viruses might be attributed to distinct components of their genomes. Although much emphasis has been placed on the NS1 protein of the 1918 virus acting as an inhibitor of the type I IFN response, recent evidence suggests that the viral proteins PB1 (a polymerase), HA and NA contribute to its pathogenicity 63 . likewise, the polymerases of H5N1 viruses have been linked to increased viral pathogenesis 64 , suggesting that the increased pathogenesis of these viruses may be related to their replicative fitness.",

Studies carried out in our laboratory have combined the use of functional genomics with a cynomologus macaque infection model to study the host response to this virus 68 . We observed that SARS-CoV-infected macaques show a strong increase in the expression of innate immune response genes early after infection and that this response wanes after 4 days. Conversely, genes that are induced later in infection tend to be involved in the cell cycle and in cell repair. None of the animals used in this study succumbed to infection, and SARS-CoV-induced pathology in these macaques resembled the pathological changes seen in the majority of human patients with SARS who recover from the disease 68 . unlike the findings of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus study, these data suggest that early immune responses to SARS-CoV infection are productive and enable the host to properly fight the virus, allowing a return to cellular homeostasis.

To assess the impact of infection on primary target cells, gene-expression profiling was carried out in tissue-culture systems comparing wild-type and vaccine strains. For both measles and yellow fever, it was clear that the attenuated vaccine strains led to a greater induction of the type I IFN response than the pathogenic wild-type virus 84, 85 . Although in the case of measles virus this disparity in the IFN response has previously been shown by serological techniques 86 , expression analysis indicated that the antagonism of the response by the wild-type virus originated at the level of transcription. This early induction of the type I IFN response was also evident in microarray studies examining chimeras of the yellow fever vaccine strain that were devised as attenuated live-virus vaccines against other flaviviruses such as Dengue virus 87 .

It could be considered that technical issues might hamper the relevance of these studies in assessing the role of type I IFNs in the memory response. In the case of the first study 91 , PBMCs are not a primary target of influenza virus, so virus internalization might have been inefficient and a type I IFN response might have been poor. In the measles study 92 , the earliest time point examined was 7 days after rechallenge rather than early, when the type I IFN response would be expected to be strongest.

The combination of global gene-expression data with eQTl mapping provides greater power in elucidating complex genetic traits in addition to providing insights into specific genes or mutations that might be responsible for the trait in question. This approach is currently being used to better understand the genetic basis for various disease conditions in mice [104] [105] [106] , and it is likely that it will also be useful in increasing our understanding of virus-host interactions. For example, using recombinant inbred strains of mice derived from parental strains that react differently to infection with a given virus, it should be possible to use eQTl mapping to determine chromosomal locations for potential traitcontributing factors and highlight genes of interest for the trait.",

In a mouse infection model, contemporary and 1918 pandemic influenza viruses each trigger an innate immune response that includes the expression of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and interferonregulatory factor 3 (IRF3) target genes. However, the gene-expression response triggered by the contemporary virus is moderate and transient and accompanied by only mild clinical symptoms. The gene-expression response to the 1918 virus is aberrantly high and sustained and may contribute to the severe clinical symptoms, including alveolitis, haemorrhage and neutrophil infiltration, that are observed in animals infected with this virus. This disproportional innate immune response and resulting immunopathology could also be the cause of the increased severity of symptoms observed in people during the 1918 pandemic.
