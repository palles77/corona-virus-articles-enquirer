While the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations meet at their annual G8 summit to discuss the global state of affairs, a wide variety of organizations and protesters meet in parallel to decry what they see as the negative effects of globalization. Notwithstanding these protests, whether one sees globalization as a tool to overcome poverty, hunger and disease in the world or whether one feels threatened by its consequences, one thing is certain: globalization is here to stay. Often narrowly defined as the increasing integration of the world's economies, globalization is in reality a powerful development that presents new challenges at the beginning of this millennium.",

However defined, this term has many dimensions, including economic, technological, political, social, scientific and cultural aspects. The links between globalization and health are complex and globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon that can affect health in myriad ways. Its consequences can be either direct, at the level of whole populations, individuals and healthcare delivery systems, or indirect, through the economy and other factors, such as education, sanitation and water supply (Woodward et al, 2001) . Given the enormous complexity and breadth of the issues, our article cannot hope to cover the entire range of topics that link globalization to health. Instead, we focus on those risks to health and health care that are related to central aspects of the globalization process, namely trade, travel and exchange of information.",

This rapid increase again illustrates the globalized risks for conditions that are mainly caused by diet, even in less developed countries that have coexistent under-nutrition. There were 151 million cases of diabetes worldwide in 2001, and this is estimated to increase by 46% to 221 million cases in 2010, with the steepest growth in the developing world (Zimmet et al, 2001) . The same holds true for obesity (Shell, 2001) . Of course, not all of this is globalization's fault-these chronic or 'lifestyle' diseases are mainly caused by personal choice, that is, a sedentary lifestyle, the use of tobacco and a fat-and sugar-rich diet. Nevertheless, a key factor has been the unprecedented increase in the global food trade, and its domination by large transnational companies that have developed global brand names and aggressive marketing strategies adapted to local situations (Chopra et al, 2002) . The spread of universal brand names of popular beverages and fast foods has been especially rapid in the developing world during the past two or three decades and has contributed to the global epidemic of obesity by replacing traditional diets with fat-and calorie-rich foods. It is revealing that only a short period after their introduction on the Chinese market, 65%, 42% and 40% of consumers in China recognized the brands Coca Cola, Pepsi and Nestl\u00e9, respectively (Lang, 2001) .",

In this sense, the implementation of TRIPS can be seen as exacerbating health risks.

            "text": "The globalization of trade is particularly relevant for health services that have become a commodity that can be traded in distinct ways. First, health services can be provided across borders. Examples include a range of telemedicine tools, such as tele-diagnostics and tele-radiology as well as medical consultation through traditional and electronic channels. Second, patients can travel abroad to receive health care or use certain facilities-the UK government recently allowed UK patients to seek treatment in the European Economic Area (Lowson et al, 2002) . Other countries, including developing ones such as Cuba and India, openly advertise to attract foreign patients to their clinics and hospitals. Third, health services themselves have become an industry that attracts foreign investments. Several transnational companies from developed and developing countries have already created commercial health services through the purchase and establishment of hospitals (Chanda, 2002) . Fourth, the international movement of health personnel across borders has become a significant component of the trade in health services and has attracted considerable attention in the scientific and lay press. S imilar to trade, globalization has had large effects on international travel, with serious consequences for global health. The liberalization of the airline industry in many countries has made air travel affordable for more and more people around the world, which has led to a dramatic increase in the amount of global air travel. Sutherst (2004) estimated that about one million people travel internationally every day and a similar number travel between developed and developing countries each week. Another recent report (Gossling, 2002) put the number of global tourist arrivals per year at 700 million. Far-reaching air travel, aided by improvements in aircraft technology that allow longer non-stop flights, facilitates the spread of communicable diseases. It is entirely possible that a person in the early stages of an infectious disease could be halfway around the world in 12-15 hours and thus function as a vector for that disease, aiding its spread, perhaps into vulnerable, non-immune populations. The recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is the best contemporary example of the rapid spread of a hitherto unknown and virulent viral pathogen through travel of infected humans (Figs 2, 3 and 4) . SARS was first recognized in February 2003 in Vietnam where cases of atypical pneumonia with an unknown cause began to appear. By the first week of May 2003, 30 countries on six continents had reported a total of more than 7,000 probable cases with more than 500 deaths (WHO, 2003a) .",

Each year, approximately two million children die in developing countries as a result of lower respiratory infections, mostly pneumonia. The exact origin of this Pneumococcus strain is still unknown but is likely to come from the Far East (McGee et al, 2001) . P erhaps the most profound changes that have taken place during the past 10 years have come through the globalization of ideas and information, facilitated through the revolution in information technology. The internet, satellite television broadcasting and high-speed data links across the globe have dramatically increased access to all kinds of information, even in the most remote corners of the world. Despite early concerns about a 'digital divide' that would further disadvantage the poor, these fears have been overestimated. The reality is that this divide is narrowing between rich and poor countries that have increasing access to cell phone communication and the internet (The Economist, 2004) .

Many such sites contain wrong, misleading and even dangerous information (Crocco et al, 2002) , and the lay public are often more confused than informed when they search for health advice. W ithout doubt, globalization poses risks to global health, but it also provides benefits. The extraordinary improvements in information technology have dramatically increased the speed and ease of data flow, thereby facilitating the sharing of information. Medical discoveries made in one country can be made nearly instantaneously available to patients in other countries (Wassenaar, 2003) . It has also sped up the pace of discovery by linking researchers across the globe to work on the same problem, such as the response to SARS. Global cooperation of scientists linked through the internet resulted in the impressively rapid identification of the SARS virus and the development of a diagnostic test (Gerberding, 2003) . Similarly, the New England Journal of Medicine used the internet and electronic communication to review, revise and rapidly publish vital articles on the SARS epidemic (Drazen & Campion, 2003) . And although many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) decry the negative effects of increasing globalization, they have also clearly benefited from it to improve healthcare delivery and health policy in many developing countries. A recent key contribution of the global NGO movement lies with the adoption of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). NGOs had an essential and vital role at the local, national and international levels in all development phases of the FCTC (Mackay, 2003) , and their contribution continues as they actively work with countries in the FCTC ratification process.",

Other benefits of globalization include cross-border use of health services that benefit patients and provide much needed resources to national health systems (Jain, 2003) and improved regulatory practices (Wassenaar, 2003) . Finally, one should not underestimate the power of knowledge as it empowers populations and individuals and, in turn, allows them to hold to account their political and professional leaders (Ellis, 2003) . A s the major international agency dealing with global public health issues, the WHO-together with other international organizations-has an important role in mitigating the health risks posed by globalization. Through the FCTC, the WHO has tried to impose more stringent control on tobacco use in its member states. The policies recommend price and tax measures, protection from exposure to secondhand smoke, and regulation and disclosure of the contents of tobacco products. Packaging and labelling, advertising, promotion and sponsorship are also regulated, as are tobacco dependence and cessation measures, illicit trade, sales to and by minors, and liability (Hammond & Assunta, 2003) . In May 2003, the final draft of the FCTC was adopted by the 56th World Health Assembly. The treaty has been open for signature since June 2003 and will enter into force once it has been ratified by 40 parties. As of 1 July 2004, 167 countries and the European Community have signed the FCTC and 24 have ratified it, up from nine in March-impressive progress in just four months. The most recent public smoking bans in places such as New York City, Ireland and Norway are clearly further important steps towards protecting public health from the perils of tobacco smoke.",

Such a strategy should include the use of policy, education and trade mechanisms to achieve its goal. To this end, the WHO advocates a healthier lifestyle-a recent joint WHO-FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) report recommends that consumption of added sugars, beyond those naturally present, should be less than 10% of the daily caloric intake (WHO, 2003b) .",

Such an approach must clearly involve the scientific community and must strike a balance between national security needs against the benefits of open scientific communication for future health improvement. A s pointed out above, globalization will not go away. It is therefore important to anticipate future challenges for global health and to consider how to react effectively. One major and increasing problem is the movement of health professionals from developing countries to highincome countries, which threatens the sustainability of health systems in the poor world. The Director General of the WHO, Lee Jong-wook, clearly highlighted this potential threat while addressing the 53rd session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa: \"Health systems depend most of all on skilled and dedicated personnel, and here we face big challenges, particularly in this region which, on top of everything else, suffers heavy losses to the brain drain\" (Lee, 2003) . The extent of the problem has been highlighted previously (Pang et al, 2002) and a recent survey from Lithuania, where 61% of medical residents and 26% of physicians surveyed said they intended to leave for the EU or other countries, illustrates well the potential magnitude of health professional brain drain (Stankunas et al, 2004) , not just for African countries.",

As borders disappear, there is an urgent need to develop strategies, at the national and international level, that will minimize the harm and maximize the benefits of the movement of health personnel.

As mentioned previously, the presence of foreign commercial healthcare providers and transnational health services have the potential to benefit both patients and national coffers. However, one should not ignore the potential negative impact of privatized health care. A recent systematic review of private for-profit and private not-for-profit dialysis facilities in the USA found that haemodialysis care in notfor-profit centres was associated with a lower risk of mortality (Devereaux et al, 2002) . More research to examine the potential impact of foreign commercial presence and cross-border use of health services on health is needed so that regulations can be designed to maximize their benefits and protect patients. A s mentioned previously, if patent protection leads to prohibitively priced drugs, it undermines access to new medicines among the most vulnerable populations. The effects of the TRIPS agreement on pharmaceutical prices need to be documented, and the design and implementation of international agreements need to consider the potential effects on developing countries' health systems (Woodward et al, 2001) .
