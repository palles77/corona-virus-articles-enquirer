            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, genus Avulavirus, and a pathogen of Newcastle disease (ND) [1] . ND is known as one of the most serious avian diseases with a worldwide distribution that can cause severe economic losses in the poultry industry [1, 2] . The virus possesses a non-segmented negative strand RNA genome of 15186 nucleotides [3] that encodes six main structural proteins: nucleocapsid protein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and large protein (L). The NDV genes are arranged on the genomic RNA in the order of 3 0 -NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5 0 [4] . The transcription process for NDV is similar to that for other non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses [2] . The genomic RNA is completely covered by the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and in addition contains several copies of the large protein (L) and phosphoprotein (P), which together constitute the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Apart from genomic RNA encapsidation which requires the interactions between NP-NP itself and NP-RNA, the NP protein must also interact specifically with the P and L proteins to form the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), which serves as a template for RNA synthesis [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . RdRp is the active template for transcription and replication of the viral genome. Early in infection, transcription results in the synthesis of a short non-translated leader RNA and six mono-cistronic subgenomic mRNAs which are translated to produce the viral proteins. The viral mRNAs are generated by a sequential and discontinuous RNA synthesis mechanism involving conserved cis-acting transcription start and stop signals. Later in infection, when viral proteins accumulate, RNA synthesis switches from transcription to replication. This switch is mediated by the binding of NP to the nascent leader RNA [2] . Newly synthesized NP molecules are sequentially added to the growing RNA chain. As a result of binding of NP, RdRp ignores the transcription start and stop signals, resulting in the synthesis of full-length antigenomic RNA. The antigenomic RNA, in turn, serves as a template for the synthesis of full-length genomic RNA [2] . The detailed mechanisms of the transcription and replication cellular events for any of the negative-stranded RNA viruses are yet to be fully revealed [7] . In view of this, further comprehensive understanding of the relation between NP gene and proliferation as well as other structural genes of NDV are fundamental toward a better understanding of these transcription and replication processes.",

To design a DNA template expressing a single shRNA, a 19 bp sense strand was connected to the anti-sense strand by using nine noncomplementary nucleotide acids to form a stem-loop. The DNA templates were then inserted into pGenesil-3 plasmid with a U6 promoter system and reporter gene red-fluorescent protein (RFP). The recombinant plasmids were named as ndv1, ndv2, and ndv3, respectively. The G ? C content of shRNAs were 52.64, 52.64, and 42.11%, respectively. A plasmid vector HK which contained unrelated sequence was constructed as a negative. All shRNAs expression plasmids were constructed by Genesil Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China).",

            "text": "Barik S. [16] proved that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against specific mRNAs of non-segmented negative-stranded RNA (NNR) could abrogate expression of the corresponding viral proteins, and generated the predicted viral phenotypes. Knockdown was demonstrated across different genera: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pneumovirus [16] ; vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus [17] ; and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), a paramyxovirus [16] . The results provided the first proof-ofconcept that double-stranded short interfering RNA could act as potent and specific antiviral agents [16] . The targeted genes could have a wide range of functions, thus documenting the versatility of the technique. siRNAs offered complementary advantages over traditional mutational analyses that were difficult to perform in NNR viruses, and were also an important new tool to dissect host-virus interactive pathways. The interference effect of siRNAs could be affected by several factors such as the GC content, the secondary structure of the target sequence, and properties of the terminal nucleotides of siRNAs. Ui-Tei K. et al. [12] introduced several principles to design efficient siRNA sequences: (1) In this report we showed that (1) shRNA could potently inhibit NDV production and (2) NP-specific shRNA could exert their inhibitory effect by interfering with the accumulation of not only NP-specific mRNA, but also other viral structural genes. These findings have significant implications for the use of shRNA for prophylaxis and therapy of NDV infection, and for the mechanisms underlying NDV transcription and replication. RNAi technology has been used successfully in numerous applications over the past 10 years. A large number of studies [16, [18] [19] [20] . We showed that shRNAs potently inhibited NDV production in both chicken primary cells and embryonated chicken eggs. These results suggested that the conserved sequence of NP transcription was an ideal target for RNAi to protect against NDV infection and provide a basis for further development of shRNAs for prophylaxis and therapy of NDV infection in poultry. The RNA genome of NDV is tightly encapsidated by the NP protein. This ribonucleoprotein complex serves as the template for transcription and replication by viral RNA polymerase proteins, which are L and P proteins. The switch between replication and transcription is considered to be controlled by the presence of de novo NP protein in the family Paramyxoviridae [2] . We found, however, that NP-specific shRNA interfered with the accumulation of not only NP-specific mRNA, but also P-, M-, F-, and HN-specific mRNA. These findings revealed a critical role of newly synthesized NP mRNA in NDV transcription and replication. Knockdown NP mRNA presumably blocked the ribonucleoprotein accumulation additionally blocked the accumulation of other viral structural genes transcription. NDV RNA replication follows ''the rule of six,'' that is, efficient replication occurs only if the genome size is a multiple of 6 nt [21] . Probably, in the presence of NP-specific shRNA, the newly transcribed NP mRNA is degraded; further viral transcription and replication are blocked, and new virion production are inhibited. ",

To design the shRNA molecules, we analyzed full-length mRNA sequences of NP gene from 15 NDV isolations available in the GenBank and divided these sequences into two clusters, FJ-1-85 (partial cds. ACCES-SION, AF512535, VERSION, AF512535.1, GI:21314540 CDS,1\u2026373) and JS-5-01 (partial cds. ACCESSION, AF51 2534 VERSION AF512534.1 GI:21314538, CDS,1\u2026373). The FJ-1-85 and JS-5-01 have highly homologous sequences between 1 and 373 bp. Three shRNAs targeted to NDV NP gene were designed based on the sequence in these regions. The results in this report showed that only the shRNA targeting at the region between 183 and 201 bp of NP gene could effectively inhibit the expression of the target gene, while the other two shRNAs had no obvious interference effect.
