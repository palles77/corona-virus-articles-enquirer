During the study period 456 patients were diagnosed with RV infection, 265 by PCR and 191 by culture. The median range for duration of shedding (days) by culture and PCR, respectively, were as follows-influenza virus: 13 days (5-38 days) versus 14 days (5-58 days), p 0.5; RSV: 11 days (5-35 days) versus 16 days (5-50 days), p 0.001; PIV: 9 days (5-41 days) versus 17 days (5-45 days), p 0.0001; HMPV 10.5 days (5-29 days) versus 14 days (5-42 days), p 0.2. In multivariable analysis, age and underlying disease or transplant were not independently associated with extended shedding regardless of testing method. In high-risk oncology settings for respiratory illness due to RSV and PIV, the virus is detectable by PCR for a longer period of time than by culture and extended shedding is observed.",

Overall, the median, 75th and 90th centile shedding duration for RSV and PIV was significantly longer with PCR when compared with culturebased viral detection (Fig. 1) . Because PCR is known to be more sensitive than culture, we included it in each of the models. Patients tested using PCR had a higher likelihood of viral detection beyond 14 days after initial diagnosis in all models and after adjusting for re-testing interval (OR 7.58; 95% CI 3.85-14.95; p <0.05; Table 2 ). We also examined risk factors for extended shedding. We defined this by viral detection lasting >14 days because 14 days was the median time to negative in this cohort. Allogeneic SCT was a significant risk factor for shedding that lasted longer than 14 days in model 1, but not after adjustment for testing frequency ( Table 2) . None of the four virus groups was As longer shedding times were observed in the PCR cohort, we reviewed data on symptoms at the time of each re-test. Data were available for 448 re-tests on 216 patients (82%). Significant association was seen between the existence of some symptoms and positive yield on the repeat test. Patients with cough, rhinorrhoea, lower respiratory infection, or absolute lymphocyte count 200/mm 3 at time of re-testing were more likely to still shed virus; however, symptoms were not a sufficiently reliable marker to assess for presence of detectable virus (Supplementary Table 1 in Appendix A).",

Culture and molecular-based testing (PCR) are two of the most widely available high sensitivity testing methods for RV that are currently used by healthcare providers caring for immunocompromised patients. Although testing method does not affect length of shedding, using PCR versus culture testing may affect detection of extended shedding. Though PCR is a faster, more sensitive diagnostic tool than culture, it does not differentiate between actively replicating and non-viable organisms. Moreover, viral culture success depends on many factors, including sample collection and storage conditions, virus type, viral load and cell line. Although a positive virus culture may be indicative of a viable virus, a negative result does not necessarily indicate absence of viable virus. Hence, test of cure and isolation policies for RV-positive patients remain unclear.",

This finding is of particular relevance in this population because asymptomatic shedders have been suspected to be the source of nosocomial outbreaks caused by PIV and RSV. Observational data from recent outbreaks in highrisk settings suggest that extension of contact and droplet precautions through the entire duration of shedding (as detected by PCR) is an essential strategy for outbreak prevention and control for these two viruses [9] [10] [11] 17, 18] . Interestingly, shedding patterns of influenza virus were similar among the culture and PCR cohorts and may be influenced by the early use of antiviral agents with PCR testing. Oseltamivir was widely used in both the study periods regardless of timing of diagnosis from symptom onset; this is the current standard of care for management of influenza at our institution. PCR enables an early diagnosis and treatment compared with viral culture and it is plausible that early initiation of antivirals reduces the period of contagiousness. Our data support this notion, although validation in a prospectively designed study is needed.",
