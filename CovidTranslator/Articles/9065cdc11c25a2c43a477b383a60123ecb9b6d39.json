From these studies, the high complexity and considerable redundancy of the immune system became evident. In the context of managing immunodeficient animals, the finding of a spontaneously developing chronic ulcerative enterocolitis (inflammatory bowel disease) in a T-cell receptor mutant (Mombaerts et al., 1993) , 11-2 (Sadlack et al., 1993; Mahler et al., 1996) and 11-10 deficient mice (Kiihn et al., 1993) is of interest.",

At that time infectious agents were widespread in rodent colonies, and many experiments were interrupted by infections. It became obvious that classical veterinary approaches, such as improved husbandry, vaccination, antibiotics and chemotherapeutics, would not eliminate pathogens, and therefore gnotobiotic techniques such as caesarean derivation and subsequent raising in isolation were established. This resulted in the elimination of various organisms, such as Mycoplasma pulrnonis, which had previously been ineradicable. However, infections were still prevalent in many colonies. More sophisticated experimental procedures were increasingly sensitive to the influence of viruses. Some viruses had been tolerated in the past as they have a low potential to induce clinical disease, but both scientists and breeders were aware of their presence. It was shown later that many of these agents, although clinically silent, can induce increased variation between individuals and can influence biochemical or immunological functions. Research complications occurred frequently, resulting in the need to eliminate also those agents that cause clinically silent infections, and to monitor colonies of rodents for the presence or absence of such organisms.",

Health monitoring procedures in animal populations differ from the procedures used in human medicine. Especially in populations of small laboratory animals, such as mice and rats, a single animal has only a limited value. Health monitoring of laboratory rodents aims at detecting health problems or defining the pathogen status in a population rather than in an individual. Therefore, systematic laboratory investigations (health surveillance programmes) are necessary to determine the colony status and, most importantly, to prevent influences on experiments. Disease diagnosis differs from monitoring in that abnormalities are the subject of testing.

Animals coming from outside have to be checked to assess or exclude the risk of introducing unwanted organisms, and animals already within the unit are monitored to define their status and to obtain information on the presence or absence of infectious agents in the colony. It is obvious that a sufficient number of animals has to be monitored. Based on a recommendation by the ILAR Committee on Long-Term Holding of Laboratory Rodents (1976), it has become common practice to monitor at least eight randomly sampled animals, which is (theoretically) sufficient to detect an infection with a 95% probability if at least 30% of a population is infected. Monitoring animals of different ages is useful, because younger animals often have a greater parasite or bacterial burden, whereas older animals (2 3 months) are more suitable for detecting viral infections.",

            "text": "Random sampling for monitoring is not a serious problem in breeding colonies, but it is usually impossible in experimental units or not reasonable in the case of immunodeficient animals. Immunodeficient animals may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of antibodies, and so their status can be evaluated only by the use of sentinels. It is therefore advisable to have sentinel animals in each experimental unit in order to evaluate the status of a population. Such animals should be kept in such a way that they receive maximum exposure to potential infections. If sentinels are not bred within the colony that is being monitored, they must be obtained from a breeding colony of known microbiological status, i.e. they must be negative for all rodent pathogens. The sentinel animals must be housed for a sufficiently long time in the population that is to be monitored in order to develop detectable antibody titres (for serology) or parasitic stages. It is common to house sentinels in a population for at least 4-6 weeks prior to testing, longer periods are even better. In most cases, outbred animals are used as sentinels, because they are cheaper and more resistant to clinical disease than are inbred animals. Inbred animals may in specific cases (e.g. for virus isolation) be more valuable as sentinels, because they may be more sensitive to an agent and thus more likely to develop clinical disease. In other cases, their extreme I I 5 or even complete resistance to specific agents may be a reason to use specific strains with known characteristics. For example, C57BL/6 or DBA/2 mice are sensitive to clinical infections with MHV, whereas A/J mice are resistant to this virus. On the other hand, C57BL/6 mice are resistant to ectromelia virus (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987) . This virus causes high mortality with typical skin lesions in C3H mice, and high mortality but minimal skin lesions in CBA and DBA/2 mice. Use of immunodeficient animals, such as thymus-aplastic nude mice, as sentinels may increase the sensitivity if specific bacterial pathogens such as Pusteurella pneurnotropica, parasites (e.g. Spironucleus rnuris) or viruses are to be detected in a population. In the past, injection of cortisone to suppress the immune system was recommended. Cortisone results in overgrowth and thus makes it easier to detect bacterial pathogens directly. However, cortisone tests have lost importance as the direct demonstration of microorganisms can now be performed more easily by means of molecular methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",

When monitoring an immunodeficient colony, to avoid false-negative results in serological tests animals whose immune responsiveness is well known (e.g. old vasectomized males, retired breeder females) should be used as sentinels in order to obtain reliable serological results. It is advisable for classical barrier systems to have sentinel animals in each animal room. The animals should be housed in various locations on the bottom shelves, without filter tops.

Each isolator or microisolator cage must therefore be considered as a self-contained microbiological entity. Health monitoring under such housing conditions as well as monitoring isolator-housed animals can only be conducted by the use of sentinel animals. Due to limited space, less than the recommended number of animals are available in many cases, which is acceptable if sentinels are properly housed. In the case of isolators, a realistic number of sentinel animals is housed in one or several cages (depending on the isolator size) on soiled bedding taken from as many cages as possible.

Naturally, economic considerations are important as well. Both of the recommendations of the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) (Kraft et al., 1994; Rehbinder et al., 1996) state that monitoring should be conducted quarterly. Most commercial breeders of laboratory rodents monitor more frequently (every 4-6 weeks). In most multipurpose units housing immunodeficient or infected animals, more frequent monitoring is preferable as this will result in earlier detection of an infection. As a general rule, it is advisable to monitor a small number (e.g. 3-5) of animals from each unit every 4-6 weeks instead of 10 animals every 3 months. Under practical conditions, not every animal may be monitored for all micro-organisms. Depending on the factors already mentioned, the frequency of testing may be different for different agents. Monitoring for more frequently occurring organisms or for zoonotic or otherwise important agents will be performed more frequently (monthly), whereas testing for unusual organisms like K-virus or polyoma virus can be done less frequently (e.g. biannually or annually). Results obtained from monitoring of sentinels are valid for all animals of the same species within a population, irrespective of the experiment or animal strain. Independent from animals which are scheduled for monitoring, all animals with clinical disease should be submitted for direct examination for micro-organisms (bacteria, parasites, viruses) and for histopathology.",

            "text": "Less is known about the ability of most parasites to influence research results. They are considered to be a hygiene problem and are therefore eradicated from rodent colonies. Some protozoans, such as trichomonads, are occasionally detectable in pathogen-free animals from commercial breeders. They are considered to be apathogenic, and nothing is known about their influence on the physiology of animals. They are, however, likely to be species specific, and thus might be an indicator of a leak in the system or of the existence of direct or indirect contact with wild rodents. The most complex problems exist for bacteria. In contrast to viruses their importance in laboratory animals is usually estimated on the basis of their ability to induce pathological changes or clinical disease, since almost nothing is known about most rodent bacterial species with regard to their potential to cause other effects on their hosts and on experiments. Insufficient information exists on the taxonomy and proper identification for various rodent-specific bacterial species such as Past. pneumofropica or other members of the Pasteurellaceae (e.g. Haemophilus influenzaemurium, Actinobacillus muris). Lack of detailed information on the characteristics of these organisms together with the presently unclear taxonomic situation often leads to misidentification, and the lack of knowledge about species specificity impedes their elimination. The FELASA working group on animal health (Rehbinder et al., 1996) therefore decided to recommend that rodents should be monitored for all Pasteurellaceae. There is, however, evidence, that some growth-factor-dependent Pasteurellaceae found in rodents are closely related to Haemophilus parainfluenzae and might therefore be transmitted by humans (Nicklas et al., 1993b) . It is unclear if these bacteria can be eradicated permanently from barrier units, because exposure of barrier-produced animals to humans represents a permanent risk for reinfection. The same is true for several members of the Enterobacteriaceae ( E . coli, Klebsiella, Proteus), Staph. aureus and Pseud. aeruginosa, for which humans are the reservoir. Another problem arises from the fact that many bacteria are presently being reclassified, resulting in changes in their names. For example, the mouse-specific organism known as 'Citrobacter freundii 4280' has recently been reclassified as Citrobacter rodenfium (Schauer et al., 1995) . Whole genera have been renamed, and additional bacterial species have been detected, e.g. Helicobacter hepaficus, Heli. muridarum and Heli. bilis (Lee et al., 1992; Fox et al., 1994 Fox et al., ,1995 . Some of these fastidious organisms are not detected or not properly identified by all monitoring laboratories. Adding such known pathogens to a list for which animals should be monitored may be unrealistic as long as proper methods for their detection and identification are not readily available in a monitoring laboratory.",

In the latter case new breeders should only be introduced via embryo transfer or hysterectomy (see pages 162-163).

Such materials can be stored frozen without loss of infectivity, and may be hazardous to humans or laboratory animals even after decades. The problem of viral contamination in biological materials became obvious in the studies done by Collins and Parker (1972) . They monitored 475 murine leukaemias and tumours and found viral contamination in 69% of the samples. The same percentage of contaminated mouse tumour samples was found by Nicklas et al.

Managers of animal facilities had to learn techniques to prevent, control and eradicate infection and means of adapting the facilities for their own purposes. As a consequence, the diversity of viruses and the frequency with which they are detected has declined markedly. Virus infections have now been almost entirely eradicated from most commercial breeding colonies. This gave animal care unit administrators and researchers the opportunity to procure and maintain virus-free stocks, and researchers to use better standardized animals for research. However, this progress of eradication has not occurred without periodic shut-downs at breeders' and users' facilities.",

It has to be expected that more recent statistics would reveal that the prevalence of murine viruses has declined further. However, most facilities house at least small numbers of infected animals or animals of unknown status. Many small or decentralized facilities do not monitor at all. Today, murine parvoviruses and MHV are the most prevalent agents in rodents. Especially for parvoviruses the situation is unclear, because recently described parvoviruses have not yet been sufficiently characterized, and only limited knowledge exists about their prevalence. Various viruses are still prevalent at a low level. These can emerge unexpectedly, as occurred a few years ago when a sudden outbreak of ectromelia was observed in the USA (Dick et al., 1996) .

A few parasites (pinworms, mites, protozoans) are still endemic in various rodent colonies, but most of the primary bacterial pathogens (Salmonellae, Corynebacterium kutscheri, Leptospira, Streptobacillus moniliformis) are no longer detected in well-run facilities, although they may re-emerge as shown recently (Wullenweber et al., 1990; Koopman et al., 1991) . Clostridium piliforrne, which is the causative agent of Tyzzer's disease, and Myc. pulmonis, are detected more frequently. Most experimental colonies and some commercial breeders' colonies are positive for Pasteurellaceae like Past. pneumotropica and Actinobacillus murk. The real prevalence of organisms belonging to this family is not definitely known, due to difficulties in identification. The situation is also unclear for Helicobacter species, because these cannot be detected in all monitoring laboratories. It has to be expected that these, too, are widespread in laboratory rodents. Such organisms have in the past been spread by animals that had become infected long before the organisms had been detected. It is, therefore, extremely important that germ-free or gnotobiotic animals, rather than SPF animals, are used for hygienic rederivation in order to avoid this problem in the future.",

Some of the deficiencies have been shown to be complex, involving several genes rather than being determined by a single point mutation (e.g. PrkdPd, HfiZI\"\"). Despite phenotypic similarities the genetic basis of various mutations must not be the same. The genetic factors coding for similar phenotypes may act at different developmental stages or differentiation steps (e.g. Prkdc\"\", RagZ/Rug2). However, it should be kept in mind that the phenotypic appearance of a mutation might be strikingly altered by the genetic background of the mutant-bearing strain, as has been reported for a large body of examples. While db/db mice on a C57BL/Ks background (strain of origin) develop an early-onset diabetes that resembles in some respects human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 11), the C57BL/6J background has been shown to be diabetes resistant (Coleman, 1978; Leiter et al., 1979) . Another example is mice that lack the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). On the genetic background of 129/Sv, mutant fetuses are retarded and die at midgestation; whereas on a mixed background like 129/Sv x C57BL/6 or 129/Sv x C57BL/6 x MF1, fetuses survive until birth and to postnatal day 20, respectively (Sibilia and Wagner, 1995) . Mice carrying a null-mutation of the interleukin-2 gene (ZL2rm1H0r) on the original 129/01a x C57BL/6 background (129,B6) develop normally during the early postnatal period until about weaning. Thereafter, immunodeficiency becomes evident and the mice die within the next 4 weeks or develop an inflammatory bowel disease (Sadlack et al., 1993) . If this knock-out mutation is transferred onto a BALB/c background the lifespan is considerably shortened, with none of the mutants surviving the third week: in C3H/HeJCrl-ZL2'm'H\"' death occurs by 7 weeks and in C57BL/6J-ZL2rm1Ho' by 12-24 weeks of age . Such effects of the host genome on the expression pattern of genetically defined single-locus mutations must always be considered, not only when setting up experiments, but also when establishing a new mutation by transferring it onto a given genetic background.",

The conventional system should be improved by basic hygienic precautions (e.g. overshoes, overalls, and hand washing). The colony should be monitored regularly in order to detect infections, which may influence the experimental results or the embryo-producing capacity. In addition, monitoring means that the risk to other colonies within the animal facility can be better calculated and precautions initiated.",

The original problem encountered with isolator cages was to combine sufficient ventilation with effective filtration (Lipman, 1992) . In fact, it was found that in static (i.e. not forced) ventilation conditions the exchange of air between the interior of the cage and the room was fairly low, causing the humidity and the carbon dioxide and ammonia concentrations to increase to intolerable levels within the cage (Schoeb et al., 1982; Lipman et al., 1992; Choi et al., 1994; Huercamp and Lehner, 1994) . In addition, residual air exchange was found to occur mostly via the space between the filter top cover and the cage (Keller et al., 1989) , implying a break in the petri-dish barrier. Therefore, animals should not be housed in filter top cages in static conditions other than for short-term transport within a facility. A considerable improvement was achieved by the use of individually ventilated cages (IVC) system. Various systems of this type are now commercially available as a complete rack unit with HEPA-filtered ventilation and exhaust (for a comparison of different systems see Corning and Lipman, 1991; Hasenau et al., 1993; Perkins and Lipman, 1996; Tu et al., 1997) . In the IVC system, the environmental conditions within the cages are less variable and less stressful for the animals. Temperature, humidity and ammonia levels comply with or are better than those required by the Code of Practice for Housing and Care of Animals used in Scientific Procedures (Home Office, 1989) . Although the noise levels are higher than the room background level, they are found to be tolerable (Perkins and Lipman, 1996) .",

A further development could be the integration of the IVC system into the room ventilation, allowing ease of accessibility to the machinery. The air supply to the residual room does not need to be ultrafiltered and the air exchange rate can be reduced, saving costs by up to 50% and thus compensating, at least partially, for the high cost of the IVC system (Lipman, 1993; Clough et al., 1995) . In the latter context it should be remembered that the animals are exposed directly to fluctuations, especially in the temperature of the climatization machinery, without any compensation from the air of the room. Running the IVC system at negative pressure helps to protect the environment from contamination by quarantined or infected animals. However, special requirements need to be considered when working with immunocompromised animals (see pages 137-138).",

In addition, when working with immunodeficient animals attention should be directed to the translocation of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract through the epithelial mucosa and into the organism (Oshugi et al., 1996) . The question arises as to whether the SPF standard is adequate for severely immunodeficient animals, or if a more stringent contaminant standard (gnotobiotic, germ free) is necessary. However, it should be taken into account that the immune response may depend on the general prestimulation of the immune system, which is lower in gnotobiotic or germ-free animals.

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, the phenotype of a gene governing a state of immunodeficiencyeither 'natural', induced or transgenicmay be seriously altered by its genetic background. While most of the established natural and induced mutants have been established in or transferred to an inbred background, many of the most recently developed transgenic and targeted mutants have a segregated mixed background, which should be back-crossed to more than one defined inbred strain in order to be able to make comparisons with the transgenic or targeted mutant and the modulating effects of different genetic backgrounds. There are many mating systems for breeding rodents (Green, 1981) . Unfortunately not all of them can be used either to propagate or to maintain a mutation resulting in immunodeficiency in the bearer. Nevertheless, the major mating systems are: (1) inbreeding by brother x sister matings, thus transferring the mutant/mutated allele to a standard inbred strain background; and (2) propagating the mutation without inbreeding. The latter is used only in those cases where inbreeding is not successful. Assisted reproduction such as in vitro fertilization (NF; Box 4) with embryo transfer (Box 5) might be required. If viability and fertility are reduced, specific measures might be necessary. If the mutant females are unable to mate, or, although being fertile in the sense that they are able to produce functional oocytes are infertile in the sense that they are physically unable to bring offspring to term (as is the case in mice carrying the obese mutation or muscular dystrophy), transplantation of ovaries to unaffected syngeneic or, for example, C.B. 17-scid females (Stevens, 1957) .",

In general, this profile is composed of monogenetic polymorphic markers, which may be further differentiated by the method of detection into immunological, biochemical, cytogenetical, morphological and DNA markers. Due to the recent rapid development of microsatellite markers (simple tandem repeats (STRs)), these have almost fully replaced the classical genetic markers in routine applications. A large number of primer pairs for mice and rats is available (e.g. through Research Genetics Inc., Huntsville, AL, USA; http:/ /www.resgen.com). Other sources of primers are also available through the World Wide Web (e.g. markers deveIoped by the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford, UK; ftp://ftp.well.ox.ac.uk/pub/genetics/ratmap). However, as with the classical markers it is indispensable to set up a genetic profile representing a random sample of the genome, which should be evenly spaced on the chromosomes, and which will allow one to discriminate between all strains maintained per separate housing unit. Unfortunately this information is only partially available and not yet compiled in an accessible database. Conditions for PCR amplification and electrophoretic separation of the amplicons are described in Box 7. These conditions deviate from those provided primarily with respect to electrophoretic separation. As there is only one amplification protocol it could be necessary to adjust the temperature conditions and MgZ' concentration for each microsatellite marker. For routine screening, separation on agarose gel and visualization by ethidium bromide will suffice. If separation of the amplicons is insufficient in agarose, one should run a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE; see Box 7). As radioactive labelling is with \"P using a kinase reaction, and since the isotope half-life is relatively short, a silver staining procedure is recommended (Box 7).",

The grafts are placed in Petri dishes on saline-drenched filter paper, and the excised graft beds are covered with gauze sponges moistened in saline until grafts are transferred.

The technique is based on the combined use of restriction enzymes and selective PCR primers. Multiple polymorphisms are simultaneously visualized without the need of prior information on genomic sequences. DNA is cleaved into fragments using a set of two restriction enzymes: a rare cutter and a frequent cutter. Adapters are ligated to the ends of the restriction fragments. Adapters that stick to the site of the rare cutter carry a biotin label. Biotincarrying fragments are isolated by binding to streptavidin beads, resulting in an enormous reduction in the number of fragments. Only fragments containing a rare-cutter end on one side and a frequent-cutter end on the other side, or rare-cutter ends on both sides, will remain in the fragment pool. Subsequently, a further selection will be performed by PCR using selective primers. The PCR primers overlap the adapters and the restriction sites and are provided with a specific extension at their 3'ends causing the further selection. The resulting amplicons are separated by PAGE. The AFLP pattern reflects multiple polymorphic markers of presence/absence type, i.e. dominant/recessive markers (Otsen, 1995) .",

Furthermore, many individual research colonies are microbiologically contaminated, so that virus-free facilities are reluctant to import mice from unknown sources. Therefore, the freezing of preimplantation embryos is considered to be the proper means to cope with the multiplicity of strains of mice and rats presently available, to serve as a safeguard against loss, to allow for eradication of infections if the embryo transfer is performed under aseptic conditions onto barrier maintained surrogate dams, and to reduce the costs for valuable strains presently not used. Despite certain improvements, the freezing of murine embryos is a time-consuming and cost-effective task. While outbred stocks and hybrids in general respond to superovulation by gonadotrophins (see protocols in Box 11) with a high ovulation rate, inbred strains show a rather variable response. In addition revitalization results also vary substantially on a strain by strain basis, and strongly depend on the skill of the personnel. Therefore, it has not been possible to preserve as many strains recently developed by molecular genetic methods as necessary. Freezing of sperm, if sufficiently efficient, could assist in this task. As with sperm freezing the protocols for in vitro fertilization (NF) (see Box 4) also need to be improved.",

In the case of an outbred stock the group of revitalized breeding pairs required to build up a new colony should be genetically equivalent to their colony of origin, i.e. the genotype distribution within both populations should be equivalent. Furthermore, mating of close relatives must be avoided to ensure that the coefficient of inbreeding is kept at a low level. A random sample of breeders collected from the source colony may fulfill this requirement and serve as donor parents. In practice this can be realized if only embryos with different ancestors are frozen in one single cryotube (subsequently termed 'embryo batch') and if a number n of independent batches is used to rederive a new colony. In dealing with inbred strains it is to be differentiated whether a foundation colony is to be restocked or whether the frozen embryos should serve in future as breeders of an expansion colony. The former have to be derived from a single pedigreed breeding pair, preferably originating from the foundation colony. Restocking of an expansion colony also calls for pedigreed embryos, but these can be derived from different donors as strict brother x sister mating is not mandatory. In the case of congenic (CR) and mutant, as well as most transgenic or knock-out lines, it is the primary objective to maintain the differential or mutant/mutated gene. For this purpose a pool of embryos (descending from different donors) may suffice. After rederivation, however, one to four back-cross cycles to the background strain are required.",

According to these figures, 100 cryopreserved embryos is to be regarded as the lower limit to provide a safe backup of a strain. Nevertheless, a safe backup of a strain is affected not only by the size and the number of embryo batches frozen, but also by the revitalization rate significantly differing between strains as well as according to the skill of the staff in embryo transfer techniques. For routine embryo banking, therefore, 220 embryo batches per strain, each containing 10-20 embryos, will be sufficient to guarantee a safe backup. Effective superovulation protocols thus are crucial. The average rate of embryo batches per hormone-treated female (210 two-cell embryos per batch per female) amounts to about 30% (range 1043%). For eight-cell embryos this rate drops to 20-25% (H. J. Hedrich and I. Reetz, unpublished data) .

Containers sterilized by this method must not be used until a sufficient post-sterilization aeration (approximately 3 weeks) has been completed (Schiewe et al., 1985) . There are, however, straws available that withstand heat sterilization. To avoid mixing up embryo batches, each container must be permanently marked with the strain name and strain code. This is facilitated by using a hand-driven printing device. In addition, each freeze run must be monitored by means of a temperature recording, and its reliability should be monitored by using a vitality test of an additional embryo batch of an F1 hybrid or outbred stock highly responsive to superovulation. After the freeze run the cryocontainers should be properly placed at defined locations/compartfhents within the embryo repository in a properly controlled liquid nitrogen refrigerator. It is important to keep full records, which should include the conditions of the freeze run (type, cryoprotectant used, etc), a strain description, and an identification and storage location.

Consistent results have been obtained in the authors' laboratory by applying a two-step freezing technique. For freezing, plastic straws are used instead of other containers because they can be better marked and almost no embryos get lost during manipulation. The straws are loaded, with the embryos being placed in the centre of the medium column. In a programmable automatic ethanol cooling bath the embryos are equilibrated at 0\u00b0C in freezing medium with 2.0 M propanediol as the cryoprotectant for 5 min, and then cooled to -6\u00b0C at a rate of 1\u00b0C min-', seeded (induction of extracellular ice crystal formation by touching the straw at the air-medium interface with a metal rod precooled in liquid nitrogen) and then slowly cooled to -32\u00b0C at a rate of 0.4\"C min-', held for about 5 min at -32\"C, and transferred directly to the liquid nitrogen refrigerator.

Most groups use glycerol (3.04.0 M) as a permeable and sucrose (0.25-1.0 M) as a non-permeable cryoprotectant. Before freezing the embryos must be dehydrated. At temperatures below 4\u00b0C embryos can tolerate exposure to a concentrated solution of cryoprotectants and the associated osmotic dehydration.

For safety reasons, containment is generally necessary if animals are artificially infected with pathogenic micro-organisms. Various systems can be used, depending on the properties of the agents (e.g. pathogenicity, environmental stability, spreading characteristics). In the case of low pathogenic organisms, microisolator cages might be sufficient. The risk of infection during handling is reduced if all work with I67 open cages is conducted in changing cabinets or in laminar flow benches. Individually ventilated cages operating with a negative pressure are more suitable than microisolators to prevent spread of micro-organisms if they are handled properly.

            "text": "Four different safety levels have been established (Centers for Disease Control/National Institute of Health, 19931, which consist of combinations of laboratory practices and techniques, safety equipment and recommendations for operation of laboratory facilities. The classification of an organism or parts of it (DNA, toxin) is based on various factors such as the host spectrum, virulence for healthy humans and animals, minimal infectious dose, mode of transmission, epidemiological situation (prevalence in a given population), availability of antibiotics, vaccines or other treatments, and tenacity ( Table 11 ). The recommended levels represent those conditions under which the organism can ordinarily be safely handled. Sometimes, more stringent practices may be necessary when specific information is available to suggest that virulence, pathogenicity, vaccine and treatment availability or other factors are altered. For example, hantaviruses are typical BL-3 pathogens. Many researchers consider hantaviruses BL-4 agents when inoculated into laboratory animals, especially into rats, since there is clear evidence of aerosol transmission from infected animals. The safety instructions are applicable for working with organs, tissues or cells that contain or may shed microorganisms. For example, many cell lines have been immortalized by SV40 virus and may shed this pathogen. Such cells, like the virus, should be handled by using biosafety level 2 practices. The biosafety level assigned to an agent is based on activities typically associated with the manipulation of quantities and concentrations of infectious agents required to accomplish its identification. If activities require larger volumes or higher concentrations or manipulations which are likely to produce aerosols, additional personnel precautions and increased levels of containment are indicated. Details on all aspects of biosafety have been published by the Centers for Disease Control/National Institute of Health (1993) and BG Chemie (1990 Chemie ( , 1991 Chemie ( a,b,c, 1992 . 6iological safety level I (6L-I) applies to the use of characterized microorganisms not known to cause disease in healthy human adults. BL-I organisms are, for example, attenuated viruses that are used for the production of life vaccines (e.g. polio vaccine), or viruses that are apathogenic for man and animals. Life vaccines for animals containing viruses that may be pathogenic for humans may keep their pathogenic properties for humans. Therefore, a Newcastle disease vaccine, although apathogenic for poultry, is classified as level 2. Other level I pathogens are many plant viruses (e.g. tobacco mosaic virus) and viruses of bacteria and fungi (phages). All bacteria that do not multiply in warm blooded organisms, saprophytes and bacteria that have been used for the production of foodstuffs (e.g. lactobacilli) or the preservation of vegetables are also classified as class I. Fungi that do not infect healthy humans (even if they have the potential to infect immunocompromised hosts) are classified as level I (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Malassezia furfur, Aspergillus niger). 0 6iological safety level 2 (6L-2) is used for work involving agents that represent a moderate hazard for personnel and the environment, for farm or wild-living animals, o r for plants. This level is applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching and other facilities in which work is done with a broad spectrum of agents that are present in a population and are associated with human or animal disease of varying severity. Most vertebrate viruses and a broad spectrum of bacteria (e.g. E coli, Staph. aureus. Clostridium tetani, Vibrio cholerae) are classified as BL-2 organisms.

Centralized animal facilities are usually multipurpose with a number of animal species or strains that are used for a variety of different experiments (short or long term) for different scientific disciplines (e.g. toxicology, immunology, biochemistry, pharmacology, teratology, surgery). Several housing systems (conventional units, barrier unit, isolators) or microbiological quality standards (infected, pathogen-free, gnotobiotic) can be found in large facilities (for more details, see pages 130-137). Therefore, strict separation of animals used for different experiments (studies of infectious or non-infectious disease) or purposes (production and breeding, quarantine) is usually self-evident, not only for safety reasons, but also in order to avoid research complications or influences between experiments. Traffic flow in centralized animal facilities is usually reduced to a minimum, thus minimizing the risk of crosscontamination. Such facilities are usually constructed in a way that proper cleaning and personal hygiene is facilitated. Bedding material from animal cages is removed in a way that formation of aerosols is avoided, in order to minimize the risk of allergies and to reduce the risk of airborne transmission of pathogens. Use of solid bottom cages helps to reduce dust formation and is absolutely necessary if experimentally infected animals are housed. The whole facility must be constructed in a way that escape or theft of animals is impossible.",

Some differences exist, because the activity of the animals themselves can introduce new hazards by producing dust or aerosols, or they may traumatize humans by biting and scratching. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control/National Institute for Health (CDC/NIH) (1993) established standards for activities involving infected animals, designated 'animal biosafety levels' (ABSL) 14. These combinations describe animal facilities and practices applicable to work on animals infected with agents assigned to the corresponding BL1 to BL4.",

All infectious waste must be properly disinfected (preferably by autoclaving), and infected animal carcasses should be incinerated. Cages and other contaminated equipment are disinfected before they are cleaned and washed. Whenever possible, infected animals will be housed in isolation to avoid the creation of aerosols. Physical containment devices are not explicitly required by the CDC /NIH (1993) for ABSL-2. Microisolator cages are not recommended because they do not reliably prevent aerosol formation and transmission of micro-organisms. They should only exceptionally be used for housing, and must be placed in ventilated enclosures (e.g. laminar flow cabinets). Therefore, the lowest level of biocontainment should be ventilated cages with negative pressure. In many institutions negative-pressure isolators are considered the only suitable containment devices for housing animals infected with potential human pathogens. Special care is necessary to avoid infections during necropsy of infected animals. Necropsies as well as harvesting tissues or fluids from infected animals should therefore be carried out in safety cabinets.",

Physical containment devices are necessary for all procedures and manipulations. Animals must be housed in a containment caging system. Individually ventilated cages might be acceptable in specific cases, but negative-pressure isolators or class I1 biological safety cabinets offer a maximum of safety because supply and removal of infected materials is done in closed containers, thus reliably avoiding a risk of transmission. Very few facilities house ABSL-3 animals. If this is really necessary, much greater safety precautions will be taken than recommended by CDC/NIH (1993) (e.g. one-piece positive-pressure suit ventilated with a life-support system).",

For otherI70parasites a different risk may arise from larval stages o r from adult parasites. For several trematodes the most serious risk arises from larval stages (e.g. Fasciola hepatica, Dicrocoelium sp., Paragonimus sp., Opisthorchis sp., Schistosoma sp.). Working with larvae, therefore, requires BL-2 practices, whereas working with adult worms is classified as BL-I. In contrast, working with Echinococcus sp. should be conducted under BL-2 conditions only if it is restricted t o hydatid cysts, whereas working with adults requires a higher safety level.Biological safety level 3 (BL-3) is used when working is necessary with indigenous or exotic agents that may cause serious or potentially lethal disease as a result of autoinoculation or ingestion o r with a potential for aerosol transmission. Among viruses, yellow fever virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or herpes virus B are classified as BL-3 pathogens. Only few bacterial species (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia pestis, Rickettsiae, Pseudomonas mallei, Coxiella burneti, Brucella melitensis, Chlamydia psittaci) or fungi (Blastomyces dermotitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum) pose a serious risk t o laboratory workers or animals or a moderate risk t o the population, and may therefore be classified as BL-3. Few parasites are classified as BL-3 organisms if working includes use of vectors (e.g. Trypanosoma cruzi, several Leishmania species like L donovani, Plasmodium fakiparum). In the case of Echinococcus species (e.g. E. granulosus, \u20ac. multilocularis), working with adult worms may be classified as BL-3, whereas BL-2 is applicable if working is restricted t o hydatid cysts.",
