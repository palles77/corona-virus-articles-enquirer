GST is then removed by site-specific proteolysis using thrombin. However, the presence of internal thrombin cleavage sites in expressed proteins can severely affect the purification of intact proteins. Cysteine-dependent aspartate-specific proteases (caspases) are efficient enzymes with defined substrate specificity. Unlike most of the proteases used for the removal of affinity tags, caspases do not leave any amino acids at the amino-terminus of cleaved proteins. We have engineered the caspase-6 site VEMD in a pGEX vector to give the pC6-2 vector. The caspase-6 can be easily removed after cleavage. Here, we describe the detailed protocol for purifying proteins using our pC6-2/caspase-6 expression and purification system. The cleavage by caspase-6 occurs in o30 min and the entire procedure can be completed in 2 d.",

            "text": "Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein expression vectors are widely used for the high-level expression and subsequent purification of proteins in Escherichia coli 1, 2 . Glutathione sepharose-bound GST fusion proteins can be eluted competitively using reduced glutathione, under conditions mild enough not to affect the antigenicity and activity of expressed proteins. However, GST is a 26-kDa relatively bulky tag that might affect the functional and structural properties of the protein under investigation, making its removal highly desirable. The pGEX vectors contain thrombin, factor Xa or PreScission protease recognition and cleavage sites downstream of GST. Among these, thrombin is widely used to remove the GST tag. However, the presence of internal thrombin cleavage sites in the expressed protein can cause difficulties when using this vector system for the expression and purification of intact proteins 3, 4 . Additionally, relatively extended incubation times (4-16 h) are required to ensure complete cleavage by all three of the proteases listed above. Sensitive proteins might lose their biological activity during such prolonged incubation periods. Most of the proteases used for the removal of various affinity tags leave one or two amino acids at the amino (N)-terminus of the cleaved protein, which might affect its structural and functional properties. To circumvent these limitations in existing technology, we engineered an expression vector containing a caspase-6 cleavage site (Fig. 1) . This site, which we termed as C6, is rarely found in naturally occurring proteins, cleaves the carboxy (C)-terminal to its short recognition sequence leaving no residual amino acids at the N terminus of the protein of interest and can yield cleaved product in a relatively short period (o1 h). The protease caspase-6 used for the removal of tags is expressed and purified as a histidine-tagged recombinant protein and can be easily removed using nickel affinity chromatography, otherwise it remains as a contaminant in the protein preparation (schematically depicted in Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "architecture and gene expression, we chose this site from SATB1 for the design of the vector, although other variant caspase-6 recognition sequences (such as VEID) also work equally well. We have shown that the caspase-6 cleavage site works in a more efficient and specific manner than the typically employed factor Xa or thrombin cleavage site. We engineered a caspase-6 site downstream of the thrombin cleavage site in the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Two oligonucleotides, casp6F (5\u00a2-GATCTGTTGAAATGGATG-3\u00a2) and casp6R (5\u00a2-GATCCATCC ATTTCAACA-3\u00a2), were designed 9 to generate a short synthetic DNA fragment upon annealing. This fragment includes the recognition site for caspase-6 and preserves a downstream BamHI site upon ligation into the BamHI digested pGEX-4T-2 expression vector. The oligonucleotides were designed according to the codon usage in E. coli (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/E.html). The annealed oligonucleotide was phosphorylated at the 5\u00a2 end and ligated with the BamHI digested and dephosphorylated pGEX-4T-2 vector, which was then used to transform competent E. coli strain DH5a cells (Invitrogen). Transformants were screened by PCR using the casp6F primer and a pGEX-4T-2 vector-specific reverse primer 9 . After confirmation of the sequence of the multiple cloning site (MCS) and caspase-6 site, we named the modified pGEX-4T-2 vector as the pC6-2 vector (Fig. 1) . The plasmid constructs for the cloning and expression of the cDNA of interest (pC6-2), and for the expression of caspase-6, are both available to research groups from non-profit organizations upon request.",

            "text": "For several functional studies, we have purified various domains of SATB1 and the N-terminal region of p53 in milligram quantities in our laboratory. We exemplify the use of the pC6-2/caspase-6 system for the purification of two different regions of SATB1, comprising residues 1-204 and 255-763, in this protocol. The first region contains the PDZ domain of SATB1, which is required for the dimerization of SATB1 (ref. 8) and has been experimentally found to possess an internal thrombin site 9 . The second region harbors the MAR-binding domain (MD) 10 and homeodomain (HD) 11 . The system also works efficiently for sarcosyl-solubilized and refolded proteins 9 . We have designed primers with ClaI and SalI linkers, and cloned them into pGEX-4T-2; the new plasmid constructs are designated as pC6-2 ClaI and pC6-2 SalI. To accommodate these changes, the caspase-6 site had to be changed to VEID instead of VEMD, although both work equally well. Using these two restriction sites for cloning, one can eliminate any vector-derived amino acids at the N-terminal. A similar strategy has been employed by Feeney and colleagues 12 for engineering the caspase-3 cleavage site into GST fusions. The specific advantage of using caspase-6 is that, until now, only 12 naturally occurring proteins have been reported as its targets (listed in Table 1 ); by contrast, the list of targets for caspase-3 is many times larger, posing limits on its use in such systems. 6XHis-tagged caspase-6 can be easily purified in sufficient quantities for large-scale use 7 . Processed and purified active caspase-6 is composed of two subunits: p14 and p19 (Fig. 3) . The cloning strategy described here can be employed to engineer a caspase-6 cleavage site in other affinity tag fusion vectors; hence, caspase-6 can be used for the removal of affinity tags other than GST (P.K.P. and S.G., unpublished data). Here, we describe a detailed protocol under three subheadings: subcloning of gene of interest, purification of caspase-6 and purification of pC6-2-expressed GST-free proteins. Examples of the small number of proteins purified using the pC6-2/caspase-6 system are shown in Figure 4 . The protocol for the expression and purification of caspase-6 has been described in detail by Stennicke and Salvesen elsewhere 7 . Step 1: On-column cleavage of GST-C6 cleavage protein",

TROUBLESHOOTING 32| Alternatively, the solubilization of insoluble proteins can be achieved by the use of denaturants, such as guanidine-HCl (at 6 M), urea (at 8 M) or detergents such as sarcosyl (0.3% (wt/vol)). After solubilization into any of the above denaturants, dialysis should be performed following dilution of the denaturant. The protein should be refolded using an appropriate protocol, several of which are freely available online (http://refold.med.monash.edu.au) [15] [16] [17] . The use of specific detergents has been shown to assist the refolding of carbonic anhydrase 18, 19 and lysozyme 20 . Sarkosyl has been used to solubilize and purify the E. coli heat-shock sigma factor 21 . We have observed the precipitation of proteins during the removal of GuHCl and urea; however, we were successful in purifying sufficient amount of proteins when 0.3% (wt/vol) sarcosyl was used for solubilization and subsequent 10-fold dilution with buffer X, followed by dialysis in the same buffer (with four changes of 10 volumes of buffer X each time). The presence of sarcosyl increases the solubility of GST fusion proteins but reduces their binding with glutathione beads 22 ; when sarcosyl is removed or decreased to 0.01%, the binding of GST fusion proteins to glutathione beads increases (P.K.P. and S.G., unpublished observations) and therefore purification yields are improved.",

The second column should be used to perform on-column caspase-6 cleavage in 500 ml caspase buffer after equilibrating the column with five volumes of caspase buffer. m CRITICAL STEP Different molar ratios of purified caspase-6 enzyme to substrate GST-C6 fusion protein (1:50, 1:100, 1:150, 1:200, 1:300, 1:400, 1:500, 1:600, 1:800 and 1:1000) can be employed to optimize the maximum cleavage at the minimum enzyme concentration in vitro. We found that a 1:500 molar ratio of caspase-6:substrate (GST-C6-PDZ and GST-C6-MD+HD) was optimal. The amount of caspase-6 required for the on-column cleavage was B1.4 times greater than that required for cleaving the eluted protein.",

The beadbound fusion protein in caspase buffer can be transferred to a 1.7-ml conical microcentrifuge tube, and an appropriate amount of caspase-6 can be added and incubated further at room temperature with mixing on a rotating shaker. The caspase-cleaved protein can be eluted by passing an additional 2 ml buffer X (reduced glutathione should not be added). The caspase-6 used in the reaction can be removed by passing the eluted cleaved protein through a prepacked 0.5 ml Ni-NTA column after buffer exchange in buffer A using a PD 10 column. The flow-through from the Ni-NTA column is free from contamination of caspase-6 and can be buffer-exchanged in appropriate buffer using pre-equilibrated PD 10 columns. m CRITICAL STEP To remove 6XHis-tagged caspase-6, it is essential to buffer-exchange the fusion protein and caspase-6 protein mixture either by dialysis or using PD 10 columns that are pre-equilibrated with buffer A.

Prepare an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and resolve the proteins by electrophoresis. m CRITICAL STEP Both the samples should not be viscous before loading. Generally, soluble samples are fine and only the insoluble fractions appear viscous. If this happens, then the boiling time can be increased or brief sonication can be performed to reduce the viscosity. The bottom particulate material should be avoided and only the top layer from the sample should be loaded in the wells. Although induction can be achieved at 37 1C to a greater extent, lowering the temperature helps to keep the metabolic activity of the cell low and also ensures that the proteins are in a more soluble form than in the inclusion bodies. Shortening the duration of induction also helps to increase the soluble fraction of protein.?
