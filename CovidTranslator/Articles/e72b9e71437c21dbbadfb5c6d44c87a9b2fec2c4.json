The accumulation of the membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the GC probably determines the site of maturation. Here we have studied the intracellular transport and targeting to the GC of G1 and G2 of Uukuniemi virus, a member of the Phlebovirus genus, and report on their expression from cloned cDNAs either together or separately by using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus expression system. When G1 and G2 were expressed together from a full-length cDNA as the pll0 precursor, both proteins were localized to the Golgi complex, as evidenced by colocalization with the Golgi marker enzyme mannosidase II. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 expressed alone also localized to the GC. However, pulse-chase experiments showed that G1 remained endoglycosidase H sensitive. G2 expressed alone remained associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). G2 could be rescued from the ER and transported to the GC by coexpression with G1 from separate mRNAs. Coexpression also increased the efficiency of G1 transport to the GC. With none of the constructs could the glycoproteins be observed on the cell surface.",

            "text": "A number of enveloped viruses mature intracellularly, rather than at the plasma membrane (PM), by budding through endomembranes. Examples of such viruses that have been studied in more detail include rotaviruses (endoplasmic reticulum; ER), coronaviruses (intermediate compartment, Golgi complex; GC), herpesviruses (inner nuclear membrane) and Bunyaviridae (GC) (Pettersson, 1991; Griffiths and Rottier, 1992; Hobman, 1993) . The molecular basis for utilizing these sites of budding is unknown. One important factor is the targeting to and retention in the budding compartment of one or several of the viral spike proteins. It is thought that the membrane proteins of the above viruses contain a structural motif that defines their compartmentalization. Only in the M (El) glycoprotein of coronaviruses has such a signal so far been localized, although somewhat conflicting conclusions have been reported (Swift and Machamer, 1991; Armstrong and Patel, 1991) . Since many cellular membrane proteins also are transported to and retained in specific intracellular compartments, the viral spike proteins may be used as good models for studying the molecular processes underlaying compartmentalization.",

Virus particles are thereafter transported in large vesicles, which fuse with the PM, thereby releasing the virus into the extracellular space. As a model, we are using Uukuniemi (UUK) virus, a member of the Bunyaviridae family recently reclassified into the Phlebovirus genus (Francki et al., 1991) . The tripartite single-stranded genome of UUK virus has been completely sequenced from cloned cDNA (R6nnholm and Pettersson, 1987; Simons et al., 1992; Elliott et al., 1992) . As for all other Bunyaviridae (Elliott et al., 1990) , the G1 and G2 membrane proteins are encoded by the middle-sized (M) RNA segment as a 110,000-dalton (p110) precursor (R6nnholm and Pettersson, 1987) that is cotranslationally cleaved in the ER roughly in the middle (Ulmanen et al., 1981; Kuismanen, 1984) . Both proteins have the same size (about 490 amino acids), and each contains four N-linked glycans (Pesonen et al., 1982) and have 26 cysteine residues in their respective ectodomains. Their amino acid sequences are not, however, related.",

To be able to study the ER to Golgi transport and the retention in the GC of G1 and G2 in the absence of other UUK virus processes, we have expressed the proteins together or separately in BHK21 cells by using the T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus system (Fuerst et al., 1986; Elroy-Stein et al., 1989) . Our results show that G1 and G2, expressed together are targeted to and retained in the GC. G2 expressed alone is unable to leave the ER on its own, while G1 is able to exit the ER on its own and become retained in the GC. Thus, a Golgi-retention signal is likely to reside in the G1 glycoprotein.",

We first modified the plasmid pTF7-5, generously provided by Dr. B. Moss (Elroy-Stein et al., 1989) by inserting into the unique BamHI site between the T7 promoter and transcription terminator a polylinker containing cleavage sites for 5' PstI, KpnI and SalI 3'. A 3 kb PstI-SalI fragment containing the whole pll0 coding sequence and cloned into plasmid pGEM-3 (Promega) was isolated from an agarose gel and ligated into the PstI-SalI-cleaved modified pTF7-5 plasmid. This generated the plasmid pTF-M. The plasmid pTF-G1, containing the whole of G1 coding sequence and the first 98 N-terminal residues of G2, was generated by first cutting pTF-M with StuI (cleaves at nucleotide 1848 within the G2 region) and HincII (cleaves in the polylinker region downstream of the cDNA insert), followed by blunt-end ligation. To express G2 alone, a construct into which an ATG-codon (also generating an NcoI site) was introduced at the N-terminus of the signal sequence of G2, was engineered by using the polymerase chain reaction (R6nnholm, 1992) . This fragment was cloned into plasmid pGEM-4 (Promega) downstream from the SP6 promoter to give pGEM-4/G2. An XbaI-PstI fragment containing the whole G2 insert was isolated and cloned into pGEM-3Zf(-) (Promega) downstream from the T7 promoter, yielding plasmid pGEM-G2. To increase the translation efficiency of G2, an NcoI-SalI fragment containing the G2 cDNA insert was cloned into NcoI-SalI-cleaved pTM1 plasmid (Elroy-Stein et al., 1989) to generate pTM1-G2. This plasmid contains the internal ribosome entry site from encephalomyocarditis virus.",

Time-course experiments indicated that G1 and G2 were first detected about 3.5-4 h post transfection. We have previously found that the reactivity of our poly-(Pab) and monoclonal (Mab) antibodies towards immature (ER-localized) and mature (Golgi complex-localized) forms of the glycoproteins vary considerably Wikstr6m et al., 1989) . These differences most likely reflect conformational maturation during folding in the ER and subsequent intracellular transport. The reactivity of the antibodies has to be taken into account when assessing the intracellular distribution and transport of the expressed proteins. In the present study, we have used two Gl-specific and two G2-specific antisera: (a) rabbit polyclonal anti-G1 or anti-G2 antisera prepared against SDS-PAGE-purified G1 or G2 (Wikstr6m et al., 1989) , which preferentially recognize the ER-forms of the glycoproteins; (b) monoclonal antibodies that preferentially recognize the mature Golgi-forms of the glycoproteins (Persson and Pettersson, 1991) . The different reactivities of the G1 antibodies are illustrated, e.g., in Figs. 6A-6C and 6E, where cells expressing G1 alone have been double-stained with the two types of antibodies.",

            "text": "Previous studies have indicated that in UUK virus-infected cells G1 acquires endoglycosidase H-resistant glycans during its transport through the GC, while the glycans of G2 remain largely endo H-sensitive (Kuismanen, 1984) . Thus, the kinetics and efficiency of transport can be studied by pulse-chase only for G1. Cells infected with vTF7-3 and subsequently transfected with pTF-M, pTF-G1, pGEM-G2 separately, or pTF-G1 and pGEM-G2 together were pulse-labelled for 20 min with [35S]methionine followed by chases with an excess of unlabelled methionine for different time periods as indicated in Fig. 7 . Samples from cytoplasmic extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-G1 Pab, and half of the immunoprecipitates were treated with endo H. Finally, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. G1 expressed from pTF-M started to acquire endo H-resistance from 30 min on (Fig. 7A) , reaching a level of about 70% resistance by the end of the chase. During the chase, no degradation of G1 was observed. The appearance of one fully and three partially resistant bands is most likely explained by the fact that G1 has four sites for N-glycosylation. The observed pattern suggests that only some of the glycans on G1 became terminally modified. The pattern and kinetics of acquisition of endo H-resistance was similar for G1 in E G1 Pa b F CTR433 Fig. 6 . Colocalization of G1 with markers for the Golgi complex. BHK21 cells were infected with vTF7-3 and transfected with pTF-G1. The cells were double-stained with anti-G1 Mab (A) and anti G1-Pab (B) to show the differential reactivity of the two antisera. Anti-G1 Pab preferentially recognizes the ER-form, while anti-G1 Mab preferentially stains the mature Golgi-form of G1. Double-staining with anti-G1 Mab (C) and anti-a-mannosidase II (D), or anti-G1 Pab (E) and anti-CTR433 (F), show that G1 expressed alone colocalizes with the Golgi markers. UUK virus-infected cells, although sialylation known to occur (Kuismanen, 1984) caused smearing of the partially resistant bands (Fig. 7D ) to a much larger extent than in G1 expressed from pTF-M. G1 expressed alone from pTF-G1 did not seem to acquire endo H-resistant glycans (Fig. 7B) . The decreased recovery of G1 during the chase indicated that G1 is rapidly degraded. When cells were cotransfected with pTF-G1 and pGEM-G2, some G1 again acquired endo H-resistant glycans (Fig. 7C) , suggesting that interaction with G2 is required for terminal glycosylation to occur. The fact that G1 also in this coexpression experiment appeared to be degraded faster than when expressed together with G2 from the same mRNA (Figs. 7A and 7D ) is likely to be due to the fact that the balanced (equimolar) expression of G1 and G2 in every cell is very difficult to achieve. We have found that G1 is much more efficiently expressed than G2 from their respective plasmid constructs. Therefore, G1 without a G2 partner would be degraded (compare with Fig. 7B ).",

The results can be summarized as follows. When expressed together from the same or separate mRNA, G1 and G2 both localized to the GC. Similarly, G1 expressed alone was also targeted to and retained in the GC. Exit from the ER was, however, inefficient. G2 expressed alone was apparently unable to exit the ER, but could be rescued onto the exocytic pathway by coexpression with G1. Two further conclusions can be drawn from the results. Firstly, that the hydrophobic sequence preceding G2, as has been postulated previously (Kuismanen, 1984; R6nnholm and Pettersson, 1987) , functions as an internal signal peptide for the translocation of G2 through the ER membrane. Secondly, that G1 and G2 translated from separate mRNAs can interact with each other, presumably by forming heterodimers (Persson and Pettersson, 1991) , i.e. there is no need to generate G1 and G2 from the pll0 precursor by cleavage in order to form a transport competent complex (see below). Similar results have been obtained regarding the formation of mixed influenza virus haemagglutinin trimers (Boulay et al., 1988) .",

Since vaccinia virus is cytopathic to cells, we carried out the experiments as early as possible in the infectious cycle. However, similar results were obtained also at later time points (about 12 h post transfection; data not shown). In a recent study, results similar to those reported here were obtained for G1 and G2 expressed by using a SV40 expression vector (R6nnholm, 1992) . However, the transfection efficiency and the level of expression using this system were too low to allow characterization of the efficiency and kinetics of the intracellular transport of G1 and G2. Thus, the proteins could only be localized by immunofluorescence.",

Since newly synthesized G1 folds much faster than newly made G2, it seems unlikely that G1 and G2 synthesized from the same p110 precursor will end up in the same heterodimer. Instead, it seems that a pool of G1 and G2 molecules exists in the ER from which G1/G2 heterodimers can be recruited. It was therefore not surprising to find that G1 and G2 synthesized from separate mRNAs were able to interact and to become transported out of the ER.",

            "text": "As has been observed previously in virus-infected cells (Persson and Pettersson, 1991) , the transport to the GC of G1 and G2 expressed together was rather slow and inefficient as documented by the partial acquisition of endo H-resistant glycans in G1. The basis for this is unknown, but may be due to an inherent property of the glycoproteins. We found previously that G2 required the continuous synthesis of G1 in order to become transported to the GC. Whether G1 also required concomitant synthesis of G2 remained less clear (Persson and Pettersson, 1991) . The results obtained here confirm the finding that G2 is unable to exit the ER on its own. Presumably transport competence is only acquired after dimerization with G1. It is well known that oligomerization in the ER of protein complexes is usually required to achieve competence to exit the ER (Rose and Doms, 1988; Hurtley and Helenius, 1989) . It was therefore somewhat surprising to find that G1 was able to exit the ER and to reach the GC on its own. The same observation was made for G1 expressed by using the SV40-based system (R6nnholm, 1992) . As shown in Figs. 3A, 5C and 5E, G1 was clearly localized to a juxtanuclear region identified as the GC by double-staining with antibodies against Golgi markers. Based on immunofluorescence, only a fraction of G1 was transported to the GC. G1 expressed alone was rapidly degraded and no evidence for acquisition of endo H-resistant glycans was obtained. This latter finding was unexpected and could mean (1) that the amount of endo H-resistant G1 transported to the GC was below detection level as studied by this method, (2) that G1 did not reach the medial-Golgi where endo H-resistance is acquired, or (3) that the Gt transported to the GC could not be used as a substrate for N-acetylglucosamine transferase. At present we cannot distinguish between these alternatives. Whether the fraction of G1 that is able to exit the ER is transported as monomers or oligomers (e.g. homodimers) remains another open question.",

The glycoproteins of Punta Toro virus (PT, another phlebovirus) also dimerize and are retained in the GC (Matsuoka et al., 1988; . Recent results suggest that the Golgi-localization signal of PT virus is present in G1, and that G2 becomes targeted to the GC indirectly by virtue of its interaction with G1. The latter conclusion was drawn from the fact that G2 expressed alone remained in the ER, while an anchor-minus soluble G2 was secreted out of the cell, but became targeted to the GC when coexpressed with a membrane-anchored G1 . The Golgi-retention signal in G1 of PT was recently mapped to the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (Matsuoka et al., 1994) .",

This conclusion was based solely on immunofluorescence localization of Hantaan virus G1 and G2 expressed from recombinant vaccinia viruses late in the infection (17 h p.i.). The reason for the different results remains at present unclear, especially since the same cDNA clones were used in both studies.
