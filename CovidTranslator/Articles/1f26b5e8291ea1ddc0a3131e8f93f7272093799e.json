Novel testing must be brought to the clinic with safety and accuracy, but also in a timely and cost-effective manner, so that patients can benefit and laboratories can offer testing consistent with current guidelines. Under the oversight provided by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, laboratories have been able to develop and optimize laboratory procedures for use in-house. Quality improvement programs, interlaboratory comparisons, and the ability of laboratories to adjust assays as needed to improve results, utilize new sample types, or incorporate new mutations, information, or technologies are positive aspects of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments oversight of laboratory-developed procedures. Laboratories have a long history of successful service to patients operating under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. A series of detailed clinical examples illustrating the quality and positive impact of laboratory-developed procedures on patient care is provided. These examples also demonstrate how Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments oversight ensures accurate, reliable, and reproducible testing in clinical laboratories.",

Technology and new genomic data developed as a result of the human genome project are leading to an explosion of knowledge applicable to individual patient care; this is the promise of precision medicine. We must continue to innovate and integrate novel diagnostic tools, genomic information, and new treatments into clinical practice. Considerable technologic advances allow clinical laboratory professionals to offer new testing that provides more information than ever before and often within a time frame that allows rapid patient care and better outcomes. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) in genetics and oncology, MALDI-TOF in the clinical microbiology laboratory, and a variety of mass spectroscopy-based methods in clinical chemistry now allow precise and rapid testing with demonstrated improvements in patient care. It is often thought that when \"laboratory tests\" are done to reach a diagnosis, they are done with a kit or on a machine, but in fact, most are procedures done with the direct involvement of a laboratory professional or physician. Laboratory tests are generally not fully encompassed by a \"test kit\" but often start with the pathologist examining the tissue section, bone marrow aspirate, or gram stain and determining what additional information is needed to provide the clinician with the best scenario so that the patient can be treated most effectively. Often, clinical laboratory professionals lead the development and optimization of these approaches to improve care and fill a clinical need, and their involvement in the process helps ensure that the highest quality standards are maintained. Ongoing development of these novel methods is critical to medicine and must be done with the highest level of safety and accuracy, yet simultaneously addressing growing demands to lower the cost of medical care in the United States.",

Currently, there is national discussion regarding the optimal regulatory oversight of laboratory tests and procedures that will balance the needed accuracy and safety with ensuring that new tests are made available to patients safely and expeditiously. Oversight provided by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently exists in the clinical laboratory. It must be noted that a spectrum of testing activities take place in clinical laboratories. These activities range from complex procedures, such as evaluation of a tissue biopsy, classification of a tumor, or culture of a microbe, to more automated or standardized tests for which an FDAapproved kit is utilized. All of these activities take place under the direction of a laboratory professional and in accordance with the detailed requirements of CLIA.",

Currently, FDA approval or clearance requires prospective clinical trial data and a lengthy review process, and thus, FDA approval takes considerable effort and time. The investment needed for this process impacts the types of tests, and also sample types, that are submitted for approval, as manufacturers must recover their investment afterward. Additionally, FDA approval for an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) specifies the sample type, clinical purpose, and other aspects of performance of the assay. When a new clinical need for the IVD arises, the need to use a new sample type arises, or any needed modification that arises in response to the ongoing and sometimes rapid advancements seen in medicine, incorporation of these improvements renders the test an LDP, with the validation needs of an LDP under CLIA.

The CLIA certification of laboratories can be accomplished through several deemed agencies such as the College of American Pathologists (CAP) or the New York State Department of Health (NYS-DOH). These organizations provide operational guidelines and perform on-site inspections based upon checklists developed via consensus of laboratory experts, which include hundreds of pages of requirements and data points. Compliance with CLIA has been built into clinical laboratory operations, mechanisms for data collection, training, proficiency testing (PT), and test implementation. Laboratories are subject to unannounced inspections and must demonstrate satisfactory performance characteristics for any test offered to ensure that results are accurate. For testing not reviewed by the FDA, such as LDPs, laboratories must go through a rigorous validation process before offering the test for clinical use. Under CLIA, the validation data collected by these laboratories are subject to ongoing peer review. In particular, organizations with deemed status overseeing laboratories (such as CAP and NYSDOH) conduct rigorous peer-inspection using detailed criteria developed specifically for molecular pathology. Laboratories also participate in required PT to demonstrate assay quality, with interlaboratory data sharing and assessment (most often led by the CAP) that leads to ongoing broad improvement in LDPs.",

However, additional regulations have the potential to slow innovation and to limit and delay patient access to novel testing that impacts their clinical care, as well as add redundant reporting efforts and significant cost. Expanded oversight of laboratories through a revised CLIA process has also been proposed (http://www.cap.org/ShowProperty?nodePath=/UCMCon/Con tribution%20Folders/WebContent/pdf/2015-cap-ldt-legisla tive-proposal.pdf.

As possible, data describing interlaboratory comparisons are provided to demonstrate the quality of these LDPs, as validated and performed in accordance with CLIA.

Since HSV infection can be treated effectively with acyclovir, it is critical to rapidly and accurately establish the diagnosis and initiate treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality. Culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is insensitive for the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis, so brain biopsy, a very invasive procedure with significant morbidity, was historically required to make a diagnosis, with results not available for days afterward. Several studies demonstrated that detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using CSF samples performed equivalently to brain biopsy, including a landmark study in 1995. [7] [8] [9] Given the ease of collecting CSF samples, the lower risk of complication, the lower cost, and speed of results, PCR became the standard of care for diagnosing HSV CNS infections in the mid-1990s, with LDPs used for nearly 20 years. It was not until 2014 that the first FDA-cleared PCR test for the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis became available, with a second test cleared in 2015. Laboratory-developed testing procedures dramatically improved the quality of care for many patients and continue to be used successfully today, as the 2 cleared tests have limitations, requiring specific instrumentation not standard in many laboratories. Additionally, one of the tests is highly multiplexed, which may not be appropriate in all clinical situations.",

Again, rapid diagnosis is needed to prevent morbidity and sequelae from encephalitis.

After primary infection, the virus colonizes the renal and urinary tracts; healthy individuals will occasionally shed virus in their urine without consequence. However, in renal transplant recipients, BK virus is the major cause of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN), putting 1% to 15% of kidney transplant patients at risk of premature allograft failure. 11 Given the lack of effective antiviral therapy for BK virus, the key to preventing allograft loss is to identify at-risk renal transplant recipients early and reduce immunosuppressive therapy before PVAN develops. Reduction of immunosuppressive therapy helps control viral replication and in most cases prevents the development of PVAN. 12 There is a critical balance between too much immunosuppressive therapy, which can lead to PVAN, and too little immunosuppression causing rejection. The ability to monitor BK virus levels in the blood allows for informed clinical decisions. Studies have shown that monitoring patients with viral load testing during the first 2 years after transplant can dramatically reduce the development of PVAN. Consensus guidelines recommend that screening for BK replication be performed at least every 3 months during the first 2 years posttransplant and then annually until the fifth year posttransplant. 13 When the plasma viral load value rises above a threshold (10 000 to 50 000 copies/mL), a renal biopsy may be performed to assess for PVAN, and immunosuppressive therapy is reduced based on the results of the biopsy. Viral load testing is also done if there is an increase in serum creatinine, as the level of BK virus aids in distinguishing rejection from PVAN.",

Cytomegalovirus has a high seroprevalence, and large numbers of transplant patients experience reactivation or primary infection, with probability increasing based on pre-transplant serostatus, severity of pretransplant conditioning, and allograft relatedness. 14, 15 Although infection can be subclinical, high or increasing viral load signals increased the risk of symptomatic disease, which can range from relatively mild constitutional symptoms to severe end-organ infection or potentially fatal disseminated disease. Preemptive therapy of high-risk patients based on the detection of increasing CMV load in peripheral blood was shown to be effective in the 1990s 16, 17 ; however, the first FDA-approved IVD test did not appear on the market until 2012. 18 In the intervening years, laboratory-developed assays played a critical role in bridging the gap. The presence of such methods and their adoption across the country enabled the routine use of CMV screening for asymptomatic patients in transplant centers soon after data supported its utility. The availability of such methods has likely saved many lives over the years, supporting early diagnosis, preemptive treatment strategies, and the assessment of therapeutic treatment efficacy. 14, [18] [19] [20] The widespread use of LDP CMV quantitative methods produced a generation of transplant physicians comfortable with the use of such methods and changed the epidemiology of posttransplant CMV disease, markedly reducing the incidence of early disease in such patients. Over the years of LDP use, numerous studies focused on continuous improvement and optimization of methods, 21 including the development of international quantitative standards in 2010. 22 The ability to rapidly incorporate advances in technology (including the advent of real-time quantitative methods) has been demonstrated by the improvement in sensitivity and other performance characteristics of such tests over time. The data accumulated throughout these experiences informed the development of the first commercially available CMV IVD assays. In fact, the absence of LDPs and the vast clinical and laboratory experience that they provided likely would have delayed the availability of commercial methods, and their performance characteristics taken longer to optimize to today's levels.",

Today, 4 assays are FDA approved for detecting high-risk HPV genotype strains in cervical specimens. [26] [27] [28] [29] These tests are routinely used to confirm the presence of an HPV infection, screen for cervical cancer, and refer cases with an indeterminate cytology examination. 30 During the past decade, a rise in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer, primarily in 40 to 55-year-old Caucasian males with limited alcohol and tobacco exposure, has been described. 31 Unexpectedly, investigators discovered the frequent presence of high-risk HPV genotype strains in these lesions. Human papilloma virus-positive head and neck cancer is biologically distinct from HPV-negative disease. Patients with HPV-driven tumors have a significantly better prognosis, including response to chemoradiation therapy and overall survival, compared to HPV-negative patients. 32 Therefore, testing head and neck cancer specimens for high-risk HPV genotypes has become standard of care and is used to guide treatment. 33, 34 However, the HPV tests that are FDA approved for cervical specimens have not been approved for head and neck cancer, leaving a critical gap for patient care. Clinical laboratories have thus had to develop new assays or modified the existing FDA-approved ones to detect high-risk HPV genotypes in head and neck cancer specimens. Inclusion of patients in several clinical trials is based on these LDPs (www.clinicaltrials.gov. Accessed April 27, 2017).

Recent examples of emerging or reemerging pathogens causing substantial human morbidity and mortality include avian influenza virus (\"bird flu\"), chikungunya virus, Ebola virus, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and Zika virus. 35, 36 At the time of their emergence, no FDA-approved tests were available to detect any of these pathogens. In response, many clinical laboratories developed, validated, and implemented the LDPs needed to care for patients at their institutions. 37, 38 These assays were based on extensive data sets and reported in peer-reviewed journals, supporting their quality claims. Since performance characteristics such as analytic sensitivity (limit of detection) may vary between different assay designs, 39 as was recently discussed for several different Zika virus tests, 40 these sorts of collaborative efforts are essential. In many cases, laboratories leading these efforts collaborated with one another to share validation materials, perform interlaboratory comparisons, and exchange blinded testing samples (http://www.usatoday.com/story/ news/2016/02/23/texas-hospitals-develop-rapid-zika-test/ 80776382/.

            "text": "The recent emergence of Zika virus, which has been linked to severe birth defects, 41 underscores the need for clinical laboratories to have rapid access to diagnostic tools. When the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared Zika virus to be a public health emergency, the first FDA Emergency Use Authorization for Zika virus testing was granted to a test available only to the public health laboratory system, not to hospital laboratories on the front lines of patient care (https://www.fe deralregister.gov/documents/2016/03/28/2016-06888/authori zation-of-emergency-use-of-an-in-vitro-diagnostic-device-fordiagnosis-of-zika-virus. Accessed April 27, 2017). As a result, the public health system quickly became overwhelmed, as it has been during past outbreaks, such as influenza. 42 In many areas, turnaround times for Zika virus testing exceeded 4 to 8 weeks (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/us/zika-testdelays-florida-pregnant.html?_r\u00bc0.

Accessed April 27, 2017). These delays critically impact patient care, particularly for pregnant women with possibly affected fetuses. In comparison, many hospital-based and national reference laboratories are able to report results within hours (http:// www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/02/23/texas-hospitalsdevelop-rapid-zika-test/80776382/.

For example, in Miami-Dade Florida, where more than 1000 people have been confirmed Zika positive and the virus is circulating in the local mosquito population, the public health laboratory system encountered a backlog of nearly 1000 untested specimens (http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/arti cle104856631.html. Accessed April 27, 2017). Diagnostic assays for Zika and other emerging pathogens will continue to evolve, 43 but it is clear that rapid identification of pathogens during other outbreaks facilitates rapid treatment and appropriate isolation of patients, leading to improved patient outcomes and potentially slowing the spread of infections such as influenza (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecu lar-assays.htm. Accessed April 27, 2017). Implementation of the first rapid diagnostic tests for influenza was directly associated with reduced length of hospital stay, decreased mortality, and reduced costs. 44 Access to diagnostic tests, early in the course of an outbreak and in hospital laboratories, has a positive public health impact.",

Microsatellite instability can be an inherited or acquired feature of tumors. Microsatellite instability occurs in approximately 15% of all colorectal carcinomas and is a consistent feature of colorectal and other tumors in patients with Lynch syndrome. 64 Tumors are classified as showing high levels of MSI (MSI-H phenotype) if 2 or more of 5 microsatellite markers (or !30%) exhibit instability, a microsatellite-stable phenotype if none of the markers show instability, and an MSIlow phenotype if only 1 of 5 or less than 30% of the markers show instability. 65 Studies have confirmed that the appropriate cutoff for determining an MSI-H phenotype is the finding of instability in 30% or more of the markers tested. The finding of an MSI-H phenotype is consistent with the presence of defective DNA MMR in the tumor. 66 The finding of an MSI-H phenotype in a CRC increases the likelihood that the patient has LS but is not specific for LS. The definitive establishment of a diagnosis of LS requires the finding of a pathogenic germline mutation in one of the DNA MMR genes. Additional testing that can be offered to determine whether a patient with an MSI-H CRC is likely to have LS includes testing the tumor for DNA MMR protein expression using IHC, BRAF V600E point mutation analysis (since BRAF-mutated MSI-H colorectal carcinomas are known to have sporadic MMR gene mutations), and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation.",

Both assays tested for the exon 19 deletions and the exon 20 L858R point mutation. Of note was that each test was approved for specific therapeutic indications and specimen types. As new drugs became available, approval for new claims was needed. Laboratory-developed procedures continue to be the method of choice due to the limitations of claims made for FDA-approved assays and performance characteristics, including types of mutations being detected. 76 Clinical laboratories participate in twice-yearly proficiency test challenges of unknown samples that must be analyzed and reported, with results graded and compared to other laboratories performing the testing. In the CAP EGFR-B-2015 proficiency test, 192 laboratories reported results from testing 3 unknown proficiency-testing specimens in late 2015. The specimens con- Note: Some laboratories do not test for certain mutations, hence, the denominator is often less than 192. 77 As patients being treated with these new targeted anti-EGFR therapies began to relapse, further studies revealed that EGFR harbors both sensitizing and resistance mutations. The CLIA laboratories have demonstrated the ability to detect all mutations in the EGFR gene as well as in other genes using NGS assays to sequence panels of cancer-related genes. 78 This panel approach allows the laboratory to provide the oncologist with a more comprehensive profile of the tumor, using a costeffective technology that makes maximal use of small tissue samples and thus makes treatment strategies more effective. In addition, the time saved by testing a broader panel of gene targets can result in better outcomes for the patient as well as fewer adverse drug reactions. For the payer, the cost savings of such an approach versus algorithm-based testing with single gene assays is significant. Currently, there are no FDAapproved sequencing assays for EGFR mutation status, and LDPs are solely used for the detection of these mutations that define therapy selection.",

            "text": "The complexity of cancer biology and the ever-evolving therapeutic approach to management of the patient with cancer more often requires expanded knowledge of the tumor beyond single-gene mutation status. Over the past several years, the laboratory's ability to multiplex testing for several genes or genetic variants has been limited by the available technologies. Next-generation sequencing or massively parallel sequencing has allowed the laboratory to provide a more comprehensive genomic profile of tumor cells in a single assay than previous methods. The ability to detect numerous mutations in multiple genes results in information that can allow the oncologist to develop a more accurate treatment strategy including therapies selected based on a \"responsive\" tumor profile and those not selected based on the presence of resistance mutations. [79] [80] [81] Instrumentation from Thermo Fisher (Thermo Fisher Life-Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), the Personal Genome Machine (PGM), and MiSeq, have made NGS suitable for routine clinical laboratory testing. [82] [83] [84] In 2015, the MiSeq Dx obtained FDA approval. Despite this approval and the routine use of NGS in LDPs setting, there are no currently FDA-approved NGS tests for application in oncology. Although many drug package inserts require or allude to the use of a companion diagnostic for eligibility, very few companion diagnostic tests are FDA approved and none using NGS technology. As an LDP, clinical laboratories are required to demonstrate rigorous performance criteria for wet-bench testing and analysis pipelines to ensure the test is functioning properly for its intended clinical purpose. 73, [85] [86] [87] Most NGS testing for therapeutic selection in cancer consists of panels of genes that range from 10 to 400 or more genes. Each test can be designed to detect hotspots of known mutations in those genes, to sequence the entire coding region of the genes, or to sequence the entire gene. The end result is a comprehensive profile of the tumor genome that can then be used to tailor therapy for the individual patient. Although NGS assays cost more than single-gene assays, the cost per gene sequence is dramatically reduced and results in cost savings over using multiple single-gene tests. Furthermore, NGS panels can be applied to very small specimen samples, using as little as 10 to 250 ng of input DNA depending on the analytic platform utilized. Since evaluation of therapeutic biomarkers is usually needed in the setting of advanced disease and such patients often have only limited tissue samples available for testing, NGS assays allow for much more extensive genomic information to be obtained compared to single-gene assays, each of which can require DNA input comparable to that of an entire NGS panel.",

One of the first (and arguably most successful) molecularly targeted cancer therapies is the BCR-ABL1-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, which was FDAapproved in 2001. In those very early days of targeted therapy, long before the advent of FDA-approved \"companion diagnostics,\" the ubiquitous and obvious method to determine the efficacy of novel leukemia treatments was to directly quantitate the target of the inhibitor drug, namely, the cancer cellspecific BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. A reduction in posttreatment BCR-ABL1 RNA levels, as measured by sensitive laboratorydeveloped PCR-based methods, was shown to be the best available test for predicting therapeutic response and long-term progression-free survival in TKI-treated patients with CML. 89 Consensus oncology practice guidelines in both the United States (NCCN) 90 and Europe (ELN), 91 going back at least a decade, have universally recommended that TKI-treated patients with CML should be serially monitored with a (laboratory-developed) BCR-ABL1 RT-PCR blood test at least every 3 to 6 months during their lifelong course of TKI therapy. The NCCN and ELN guidelines have also long recommended serial BCR-ABL1 RNA testing to directly inform not only the appropriate dose of TKI (to overcome developing resistance) but also the therapeutic switch from one TKI to another (depending on the drug's known resistance profile).",

            "text": "To directly support optimal therapeutic decision-making in the routine care of patients with CML, clinical laboratories have been offering accurate and sensitive PCR-based laboratory-developed procedures for BCR-ABL1 for at least the last 15 years. Recognizing that standardization of these LDP's was necessary to promote uniform therapeutic decisionmaking, the laboratory community undertook an extensive multiyear project to create a standardized \"international scale\" (IS) of measurement for BCR-ABL1 messenger RNA. 92 Follow-up efforts resulted in the creation of a World Health Organization-recognized panel of reference materials directly linked to the BCR-ABL1 IS 93 and the subsequent creation of secondary IS-calibrated reference materials that could be used for routine daily QC in clinical laboratories. 94, 95 Recognizing the additional need for PT, the CAP has been offering semiannual BCR-ABL1 PT surveys for at least 10 years, with a progressive increase in the number of participating laboratories (from *100 in 2009 to *190 in 2016). As proof of the nearuniversal recognition of assay standardization, approximately 90% of these accredited laboratories now report their PCR results using the standardized IS. A 2016 CAP survey confirmed excellent interlaboratory precision, with over 90% of laboratories reporting a BCR-ABL1 IS result within internationally acknowledged acceptable tolerance limits (0.5 logs) for IS reporting of a sample with an approximate 1000-to 10 000-fold reduction in pretreatment BCR-ABL1 levels 96 The primary driving force behind the remarkable increase in longevity and quality of life for patients with CML over the past 15 years has no doubt been the availability of noveltargeted TKI therapies. This has become the paradigm for personalized/precision cancer medicine programs, coupled with parallel effort of the laboratory community toward building, improving, and standardizing accurate, precise, and sensitive laboratory-developed tests for BCR-ABL1. Of note, this 15year targeted therapy program for CML occurred entirely without the availability of FDA-approved BCR-ABL diagnostic reagents, which have only become available in 2016. These FDA-approved assays were based upon those developed in clinical laboratories; they are not approved for diagnosis of CML nor do they cover the spectrum of breakpoints that occur in the disease. During those ground-breaking first 15 years of the targeted cancer therapy era, if the laboratory community had been prohibited from providing high-quality, standardized LDP-based testing under existing CLIA guidelines, the negative consequences to patient care in the past and the future would have been substantial.",

            "text": "As the genetic basis for many human diseases became apparent, sequence-based diagnostic testing was implemented as a way to provide definitive diagnoses for patients and their families. Many laboratories began offering sequence-based testing for heritable disorders in the 1990s, using a variety of mutationscanning techniques, such as single-strand conformation polymorphism, denaturing HPLC, MLPA, and others. 102 Sanger-based sequencing was the gold standard, despite being slow and expensive. The multigenic nature of some of these disorders made these sequencing approaches challenging due to the sheer number of genes and size of the sequence requiring analysis. In recent years, however, most of this testing has been converted to NGS, which offers significant advantages in terms of analytic capabilities, quality, speed, and cost. 103 The repetitive sequence reads in a single region ensure an enhanced level of quality, and NGS assays can be designed to interrogate anything from small to large gene panels, whole exomes, and beyond, depending on the clinical need being addressed. Consensus guidelines for NGS assays have been developed by multiple professional societies and address the development, validation, and quality control of these assays. 104, 105 The CAP has developed inspection checklists for laboratories performing NGS for detection of somatic mutations in cancers as well as germline mutations that cause heritable diseases. Progress has also been made in the planning and production of reference materials and proficiency samples. 106 Together, these practices and resources have yielded laboratory-developed assays that can be demonstrated to meet the quality levels needed for patient care.",

As ongoing research reveals new genes and mutations relevant to these diseases, it is important to classify newly found variant quickly and accurately. Open access to new information and consensus efforts to define standards for classification and reporting of variants and VUSs will be critical in ensuring that patients get the most upto-date and complete information from genomic testing. 104, 105 Another example is the recently discovered gene TBCKrelated epilepsy. 118 TBCK-related intellectual disability syndrome is rare with developmental delay, hypotonia, and seizures. Children with lower levels of the TBCK protein have slower cell mTOR signaling, which can be improved by the addition of leucine, which may provide future therapeutic options.

An extensive diagnostic workup involving protein studies on muscle biopsy may be used to narrow the number of single genes to be tested, but many patients never are specifically diagnosed. Comprehensive approaches to expedite molecular diagnosis now include NGS-based panel testing for sequence analysis of all disease-associated genes in a single analysis. [123] [124] [125] Heritable Cancer Panel Genomic testing for familial cancer syndromes has become routine over the past 2 decades. Approximately 50 heritable cancer syndromes are recognized and are causative of 5% to 10% of all cancers. Although familial breast cancer has perhaps become the most publicly known example of testing, genes for other inherited cancer syndromes may be included in NGS multigene panels. Patients who carry a germline mutation of BRCA1 or 2 have a lifetime risk of breast cancer of 60% to 70%. The US Preventative Task Force recommends BRCA1 and 2 testing for women who have family members with breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer or meet other criteria. 126 Numerous studies have demonstrated the psychosocial benefits of genetic counseling and testing. 126, 127 For patients who carry a germline mutation of BRCA1 or 2, surgical interventions may significantly reduce the risk of cancer or death. Contralateral mastectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of death in carriers by 48%. 128 Prophylactic salpingooophorectomy has been shown to dramatically reduce the mortality due to ovarian cancer or breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers. 129 Similarly, identification of Lynch syndrome mutations can permit surveillance leading to earlier detection and marked improvement in survival in patients developing colorectal, endometrial, or ovarian cancer. 130 Although more than 2 decades have passed since sequencebased analysis of high-penetrance cancer genes has been performed, only laboratory-developed procedures have been available.

Fortunately, the LDPs in current use, relying on capillary electrophoresis, are very accurate in determining repeat length, as attested by the excellent performance in CAP proficiency surveys.",

            "text": "Busulfan is a bifunctional DNA alkylating agent typically given to patients as a conditioning agent prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is crucial for the safe and efficacious use of busulfan due to a narrow therapeutic index based on area under the curve (AUC) calculations. Too low a dose places the patient at risk of either graft failure or early relapse. 139, 140 On the other hand, too high a dose increases the risk of neurotoxicity 141 as well as a severe and life-threatening complication termed hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). 139, 142 Hepatic SOS, previously termed hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), refers to the occlusion of terminal hepatic venules and hepatic sinusoids. Severe cases of VOD can lead to hepatorenal syndrome, causing multi-organ failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and death. Veno-occlusive disease typically occurs in the context of HCT, particularly after administration of conditioning regimens prior to HCT. It is one of the most feared complications of HCT and accounts for a significant fraction of HCT-related mortality. 143 Severe cases, which account for approximately 25% to 30% of SOS, are almost always fatal. 142, 144, 145 Despite a clear need for busulfan TDM, there are currently no FDA-approved assays available for the quantitation of busulfan in blood. For this reason, various bioanalytical methods have been developed 146 and are currently in use by multiple laboratories. Data from a busulfan proficiency program organized by the University of Washington/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance show a total of 24 participating laboratories at the present time. Of these, 6 laboratories use gas chromatography (GC) methods, 3 use HPLC methods, and 14 use liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS) methods. 147 All of these methods are non-FDA-approved tests independently developed and validated for clinical use by their respective clinical laboratories. The use of these methods is also driven by the need for high precision and accuracy. Current criteria for acceptable laboratory performance in the analysis of busulfan is +10% of the known concentrations for medium and high concentrations and within +15% of the known concentration for low concentrations. 147 This is due to the fact that dosing change decisions are based on AUC calculations, which depend on blood concentrations of busulfan measured from multiple timed blood draws. Multiple small analytical errors can easily add up to big differences in calculated AUC values.",

Very-low-level testosterone (Te) measurements are needed for adult women, whose values are routinely <50 ng/dL, in children, and men undergoing antiandrogen therapy whose values are usually <10 ng/dL. 149 The most commonly used methods for steroid analysis are FDA-approved immunoassays because they are rapid and sensitive enough for most routine applications involving healthy adult males. However, Te immunoassays lack the sensitivity requirements for chemically castrated males, women, and children. Many immunoassays also lack specificity and accuracy as immunoassays may show cross-reactivity with structurally similar compounds. [150] [151] [152] In addition, most immunoassays are not standardized against internationally recognized standards. For these reasons, a number of sensitive and specific assays using MS have been described for Te. [153] [154] [155] The lack of sufficient accuracy and standardization of Te assays is a major concern for the clinical and public health communities. 156 Several years ago, the Endocrine Society, in partnership with the CDC, convened a meeting with various relevant professional societies and industrial partners to create the Partnership for the Accurate Testing of Hormones (PATH) whose mission is to improve the accuracy and standardization of a variety of steroid hormone tests. [156] [157] [158] The PATH has worked with the CDC and begun to address this concern through its HoSt program, which provides laboratories with specimens spanning their analytical measurement range that have been previously analyzed using the CDC reference method. 155 Many assays using MS have been approved by the CDC HoST program, 159 however not a single FDA-approved immunoassay has met the performance requirements. Testosterone is a perfect example of an LDP that is indispensable for patient care and allows for accurate measurements to be made on children, women, and male patients with cancer receiving antiandrogen medication.",

Because of this widespread availability, it is also a commonly encountered toxicological agent in both accidental and self-inflicted poisonings with 6078 exposures in 2014. 160 Ethylene glycol poisoning classically presents with a metabolic acidosis caused by the production of toxic metabolites, primarily glycolic acid and oxalic acid. This is also often accompanied by an anion gap and osmolal gap. Untreated ethylene glycol poisoning can also progress to acute renal failure when high levels of oxalate anions combine with calcium to develop crystals in the kidneys and urinary tract. 161 Ethylene glycol poisoning is an urgent, toxicological emergency. Once ethylene glycol is identified, the drug fomepizole is typically administered. Fomepizole inhibits alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that metabolizes ethylene glycol, to slow the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Fomepizole and ethanol dramatically lengthen the half-life of ethylene glycol, and therefore, hemodialysis is often required to clear the poison. 162 Both the diagnosis and treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning are heavily dependent on laboratory measurements. No FDA-approved assays for ethylene glycol are currently available, and all testing is performed by laboratory-developed procedures. The 3 most common methods for the analysis of ethylene glycol are GC with flame ionization detector, GC with MS, and enzymatic assays. 163, 164 Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry is considered the gold standard for the analysis of ethylene glycol, as it can differentiate it from interferences that plague the other 2 methods. 163, 165 In addition to initial detection needed for diagnosis, the ethylene glycol blood concentration is used to determine when hemodialysis has cleared ethylene glycol to undetectable levels.",

Four national reference laboratories have adopted versions of this method, and harmonization efforts are underway. A recent clinical outcome study compared Tg-IA, Tg-RIA, and Tg-MS in both Tg-Ab \u00c0 and Tg-Ab \u00fe patients. As predicted from the assay designs, all methods were equivalent for Tg-Ab \u00c0 cases, but the Tg-MS was more accurate for Tg-Ab \u00fe cases. Tg-IA methods had more false negatives and Tg-RIA had more false positives. 168 Although Tg-MS has not yet been incorporated into the current guidelines, the ATA guideline mentions it as a promising new technique. Without Tg-MS, thyroid cancer recurrence in Tg-Ab \u00fe patients can be missed, thus delaying follow-up and creating patient harm.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, used to determine whether antibiotic treatment will be successful, is an essential component of the microbiology culture report. Emerging resistance among pathogenic bacteria and new antimicrobial agents require frequent updates to both testing methods and interpretation of the results. Most laboratories use automated instruments to perform minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing to determine whether a patient's isolated bacteria are susceptible, susceptible dose dependent, intermediate, or resistant to a panel of antibiotics. These interpretations are based on FDA breakpoint criteria published at the time of drug approval and periodically updated to respond to the appearance of new resistance mechanisms. 169 The FDA also clears automated instrumentation used to determine MIC values (via the 510k process). 170 Although the MIC testing process may not be changed, new breakpoints added to the instrument software require a revised 510k application. Because the FDA does not have the authority to require manufacturers to submit data for revised breakpoints within a specified time frame, manufacturers may elect to use outdated breakpoints rather than face the expense of a 510K resubmission. A recent example was the 3year delay between the release of updated breakpoints for diagnosing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in 2010 and the ability to use these breakpoints in the clinical laboratory. This delay was used to calculate the potential for additional carriers of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Southern California health-care systems. As many as 1821 additional carriers of MDRO Enterobacteriaceae were estimated to have occurred in Orange County, California because of this delay. 171 The disastrous spread of MDRO Enterobacteriaceae can be mitigated by laboratories validating testing methods that enable use of updated antimicrobial breakpoint interpretations before FDA-cleared testing is available. Specifically, modifying a manufacturer's instructions, including interpreting MIC results using a revised breakpoint other than that listed in the product insert, is a change that renders the procedure an LDP. Without the option of using an LDP, one is left reporting outdated interpretations that miss resistant strains leading to unacceptable patient care.",

Laboratory testing should be consistent with national/international consensus treatment guidelines, which may require development of procedures earlier or for new clinical purposes not fulfilled by FDA-approved kits. In such cases where clinical testing needs exist beyond the original FDA purpose, laboratories must be able to perform additional validation of new sample types or develop additional assays to include new mutations or analytes that are needed. As illustrated by these case examples, laboratories and professional organizations often work together to broadly compare and optimize assay performance, creating consensus standards that raise the quality of testing overall. In contrast, the current structure for FDA approval requires review of assay kits individually, or in comparison with the predicate method, rather than assessing and improving performance across the spectrum of assay options available.",

This Quality Pilot emerged from the Sustainable Predictive Oncology Therapeutics and Diagnostics working group, launched in 2013 by Tapestry Networks (Waltham, Massachusetts), which was composed of diverse stakeholders (oncologists, pathologists, patient advocates, third party payers, and regulators) for the purpose of designing a quality pilot to advance these goals (http://www.ta pestrynetworks.com/initiatives/healthcare/oncology-therapeu tics-and-diagnostics/diagnostic-quality-assurance-pilot.cfm.
