Analysis results indicate that the replacement of NC with the carboxyl-terminal half of the SARS-CoV N resulted in the production of wild type (wt)-level virus-like particles (VLPs) with the density of a wt HIV-1 particle. When co-expressed with SARS-CoV N, chimeras containing the N carboxyl-terminal half sequence efficiently packaged N. However, the same was not true for the chimera bearing the N amino-terminal half sequence, despite its production of substantial amounts of VLPs. According to further analysis, HIV-1 NC replacement with N residues 2-213, 215-421, or 234-421 resulted in efficient VLP production at levels comparable to that of wt HIV-1, but replacement with residues 215-359, 302-421, 2-168, or 2-86 failed to restore VLP production to wildtype levels. The results suggest that the domain conferring the ability to direct VLP assembly and release in SARS-CoV N is largely contained between residues 168 and 421.",

The causative agent was identified as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [13, 21] . The complete SARS-CoV genome is approximately 30 kb long and contains 10-14 open reading frames [27, 36] . Like many other coronavirus species, the SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing three outer structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) [6, 12, 22, 37] . We know that nucleocapsid (N) proteins associated with viral genomic RNA form a viral core within the envelope [29] ; however, SARS-CoV assembly and budding processes are not completely understood. The co-expression of coronavirus M with E [2, 17, 44] or N [19, 35] is sufficient for particle formation. According to these findings, the co-expression of at least two coronavirus structural proteins is required for virus-like particle (VLP) formation. In contrast, retrovirus assembly with polyprotein precursor gag gene expression is sufficient for producing VLPs [14] .",

Despite being completely unrelated, the SARS-CoV N protein and HIV-1 NC have similar properties: both contain putative proteinprotein interaction domains and both play roles in viral RNA packaging [4, 5, 18, 32, 33, 53] . A domain responsible for Gag-Gag interactions (referred to as an I domain) has been mapped to HIV-1 NC [3, 7] . Likewise, recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid proteins can undergo multimerization via self-association [16, 30, 42, 51] . Since heterologous polypeptides that form interprotein contacts permit efficient VLP production when placed in the HIV-1 NC region [1, 9, 20, 54] , we initially tested whether SARS-CoV N substitution for HIV-1 NC supports chimeric VLP assembly and release, and found that HIV-1 Gag mutants containing SARS-CoV N coding sequences as NC substitutes are capable of VLP assembly. This suggests that the HIV-1 NC assembly domain can be functionally replaced with the SARS-CoV N.",

Each mutant was transiently transfected into 293T cells and subjected to Western immunoblotting to determine its ability to assemble and release VLPs. As shown in Fig. 2b , chimeric proteins with predicted molecular weights corresponding to Pr55 gag containing a SARS-CoV N coding sequence insertion in the NC region were readily detected. Parental constructs with different extents of NC deletions were markedly defective in VLP production (Fig. 2b, lane 3 and Fig. 2c ); in particular, the DPC VLP assembly was almost abolished. Conversely, inserting the carboxyl-terminal half of SARS-CoV N dramatically restored VLP production to wt level (Fig. 2b, lanes 7-9) , suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal region of N that contains a putative self-association domain is capable of counteracting the assembly defect when placed in the HIV-1 NC region. Furthermore, we noted that DNC(CoN) (with over 400 inserted amino acid residues) was still capable of directing VLP assembly and budding (Fig. 2b, lane 4) . In contrast, PC(CoN) and NC(CoN) were moderately to markedly impaired in terms of VLP production (lanes 5 and 6). DNC(N2), PC(N2) and NC(N2) possessed medium to cell p24CA-associated protein ratios that were even higher than the wt ratio. This result could be due either to increased assembly rate or to increased intracellular mutant degradation. A slight correlation was observed between level of VLPs produced by chimeras containing full-length N and the number of HIV-1 NC residues remaining in the deleted region. Since NC(CoN) has almost all of its NC removed but retains intact SP1-NC and NC-SP2 junctures, we used NC(CoN) or NC(N2) as models for studying the effects of inserted SARS-CoV N on VLP assembly.",

Toward this end we constructed a series of chimeras containing a variety of N coding regions as HIV-1 NC substitutes (Fig. 4a) ; the ability of each chimera to produce VLPs was determined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4b , chimeras N1, N2 and N4 produced VLPs efficiently (lanes 4, 5, and 7). In contrast, the VLP quantities produced by chimeras N3, N5, N6, and N7 were smaller than those produced by the wt. Although VLP quantities produced by NC(N1) are markedly higher than those produced by DNC(CoN), NC(N5) and NC(N6), the NC(N1) release efficiency (43%) is relatively lower than the three's. This discrepancy may be due to different steady-state intracellular levels; relatively higher for NC(N1) but lower for DNC(CoN), NC(N5) and NC(N6) Fig. 4b, lanes 13, 15, 19 and 20 ). In addition, we cannot exclude the possibility of increased mutant VLP instability. Note that N1 was capable of efficient VLP production (Fig. 4b, lane 4) even though it could not effectively interact with the full-length N (Fig. 1b) . These results suggest that the N sequence, which is capable of conferring chimeric VLP assembly, is located between residues 168 and 421. Based on evidence showing that the leucine-zipper motif is competent in replacing the HIV-NC assembly function, we built a construct designated DNC(wtZiP) and containing a leucine-zipper motif sequence to serve as a control. We found that DNC(wtZiP) produces VLPs at a level comparable to that of wt (Fig. 4c, lane 4 vs. lane 2) . In contrast, DNC(KZiP) (which contains a NC replacement consisting of a mutated leucine-zipper motif) was incapable of rescuing the DNC assembly defect; VLP-associated chimeric proteins were barely detected (lane 5). Thus, the SARS-CoV N self-association domain is similar to leucinezipper motifs in conferring chimeric ability to direct VLP assembly by promoting protein-protein interactions.",

To test this possibility, we expressed SARS-CoV N with wt or individual chimeras containing full lengths, carboxyl-terminal halves, or amino-terminal halves of SARS-CoV N. Our results indicate that VLP-associated SARS-CoV N was undetectable when co-expressed with Gag or NC(N1) (Fig. 4d, lanes 3  and 5) , suggesting that no significant N-Gag interactions occurred and that interaction strength within the SARS-CoV N amino-terminal region is insufficient for NC(N1) to incorporate N into VLPs. Conversely, we readily detected VLP-associated N co-expressed with NC(N2) (lane 6). These results strongly suggest that SARS-CoV N incorporation into VLPs largely depends on intermolecular interactions within the carboxyl-terminal SARS-CoV N, which agrees with our GST pull-down assay results (Fig. 1b) .",

To test this idea, we co-expressed NC(N1) with GST-CoN, GST-N1, or GSTN2 and used isolated viral pellets for Western immunoblot analysis. Our results indicate that NC(N1) was incapable of packaging GST-CoN, GST-N1, or GST-N2that is, all of the GST fusion signals were barely detected in medium (Fig. 5a) . In contrast, NC(N2) can efficiently package GST-N2 and GST-CoN (Fig. 5b, lanes 4 and 6) , which is compatible with the proposal that the SARS-CoV N self-interaction domain is largely located in the carboxyl-terminal region.

Researchers who have studied the roles of I and SP1 domains in virus assembly have observed that some mutations in either one disrupt Gag multimerization, thus reducing VLP production [9, 15, 23, 28, 40, 54] . However, we found that PC(N2) produced VLPs at an efficiency level comparable to that of wt (Fig. 2b , lane 8 vs. lane 2). Furthermore, VLPs produced by NC(N2) possess a particle density similar to that of wt HIV-1, indicating that chimeric proteins are packed in a manner similar to that of wt. Combined, these results suggest that SARS-CoV N residues 215-421 confer a potent self-interaction capacity capable of rescuing the assembly defects of NC-deleted mutants. Although the transformation of a severe assembly-defective DPC into an assembly-competent PC(N2) provides compelling evidence that SARS-CoV N possesses a self-interaction domain capable of replacing the HIV-1 NC assembly function, we chose the delNC instead of DPC as a backbone for our SARS-CoV N fragment analysis. Our main reason was that all of the DPC-derived constructs lacked SP1, and therefore had the potential to disrupt an accurate assessment of SARS-CV N sequences involved in VLP assembly.",

This suggests that N residues 248-365 may constitute a minimum required sequence for N self-association. Both of our inserted NC(N2) and NC(N4) sequences containing residues 248-365 were capable of driving efficient VLP production, perhaps by promoting chimeric protein multimerization via the inserted sequence. The inability of NC(N3) to efficiently direct VLP assembly may be due in part to the exclusion of residues 360-365 in the inserted N sequence. According to one previous report, SARS-CoV N residues 343-402 are necessary and sufficient for oligomerizing the carboxyl-terminal region [26] . However, we have consistently observed that NC(N5) cannot direct VLP assembly as efficiently as NC(N2) or NC(N4), suggesting that the region between residues 234 and 302 is important for driving efficient VLP assembly and release.",

            "text": "However, it is unlikely that the ability of an inserted N sequence to confer chimeric VLP assembly reflects its capacity for in vitro self-association. NC(N1) (containing N residues 2-213) is capable of producing substantial amounts of VLPs (Fig. 4b) , despite being defective in packaging the co-expressed N protein (Fig. 4d) . Also note that GST-N1 was incapable of efficiently pulling down the N protein (Fig. 1b) or of being packaged into NC(N1) VLPs (Fig. 5) . One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the N1 sequence may contain a self-association domain that fails to confer sufficient interaction strength for self-association or associating with a full-length N. It has previously been demonstrated that a serine/argininerich motif between N residues 184 and 196 is crucial for N protein self-multimerization [16] . Since CA-SP1 is largely responsible for driving Gag or chimeric protein self-association, protein sequences with small self-interaction capacities may be sufficient for restoring delNC VLP assembly to wt levels when substituted for NC. If true, it is likely that the N serine/arginine-rich motif in the context of NC(N1) makes a significant contribution to VLP assembly. In agreement with this hypothesis, NC(N6) and NC(N7) (both lacking residues 184-196) were found to trigger moderate-to-marked decreases in VLP production compared to NC(N1), suggesting that even though the N selfinteraction domain primarily resides in the carboxylterminal region, part of the amino-terminal N may be involved in N self-association.",
