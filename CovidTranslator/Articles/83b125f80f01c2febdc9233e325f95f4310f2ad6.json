            "text": "During NIV via a helmet with the simulator programmed in mild lung injury, exhaled air leaked through the neck-helmet interface with a radial distance of 150 to 230 mm when inspiratory positive airway pressure was increased from 12 to 20 cm H 2 O, respectively, while keeping the expiratory pressure at 10 cm H 2 O. During NIV via a helmet with air cushion around the neck, there was negligible air leakage. During NIV via a total facemask for mild lung injury, air leaked through the exhalation port to 618 and 812 mm when inspiratory pressure was increased from 10 to 18 cm H 2 O, respectively, with the expiratory pressure at 5 cm H 2 O. CONCLUSIONS: A helmet with a good seal around the neck is needed to prevent nosocomial infection during NIV for patients with respiratory infections. 6, 7 Patients may progress rapidly to ARDS and multiorgan failure, requiring intensive care support. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may play a supportive role in patients with early ARDS or acute lung injury due to SARI as a bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation. [8] [9] [10] However, a systematic review has shown that mask ventilation, tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, and NIV may increase the risk of nosocomial transmission of respiratory infections to health-care workers (HCWs). 11 Following the outbreak of SARS and emergence of the A(H1N1) infection, it has been recommended that when NIV is required for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARI, infection control measures such as the use of helmets or full facemasks, double circuit tubes, and addition of viral-bacterial fi lters be considered. 10, 12 However, whether these infection control measures are eff ective in minimizing exhaled air leakage has not been objectively evaluated. Th is study aimed to examine the dispersion of exhaled air during application of NIV via helmets and total facemask. Knowledge about the extent of exhaled air leakage from diff erent masks will facilitate the development of preventive measures to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission during application of NIV to high-risk patients hospitalized with SARI.",

Th e HPS represented a 70-kg adult man sitting on a 45\u00b0-inclined hospital bed and was programmed to mimic normal breathing, mild lung injury, and severe lung injury. Exhaled air, marked by the smoke particles, is illuminated by the laser light-sheet, with dispersion through the neck interface of the Sea-Long helmet (A) and through the exhalation port of the total face mask attached to the HPS (C).

[12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Th e oil-based smoke particles, measuring , 1 m m in diameter, are known to follow the airfl ow pattern precisely with negligible slip. 24 Th e smoke was introduced continuously to the right main bronchus of the HPS. It mixed with alveolar gas and then exhaled through the airway. Sections through the leakage jet plume were then revealed by a thin laser light-sheet (Green, 532 nm wavelength, continuous-wave mode) created by a diode-pumped solid state laser (OEM UGH-800 mW, Lambdapro Technologies Ltd), with custom cylindrical optics for two-dimensional laser light-sheet generation. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Th e light-sheet was initially positioned in the median sagittal plane of the HPS and was subsequently shift ed to the paramedian sagittal planes. Th is allowed us to investigate the regions directly above and lateral to the mask and the patient. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] All leakage jet plume images revealed by the laser light-sheet were captured by the high-defi nition video camera (Sony high-defi nition digital video camcorder, HDR-SR8E ClearVid complementary metal oxide semiconductor Sensor, Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* Lens), with optical resolution of 1,440 3 1,080 pixels per video frame. Normalized smoke concentration in the plume was estimated from the light intensity scattered by smoke particles. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] ",

The background intensity image was subtracted from each frame, pixel by pixel, to remove any stray background light, and the pixel intensity values were averaged over all frames to determine the ensemble averaged intensity. Th e resulting image was the total intensity of light scattered perpendicular to the light-sheet by the smoke particles and was directly proportional to smoke concentration under the conditions mentioned previously. Th e image was normalized against the highest intensity found within the leakage jet plume to generate normalized particle concentration contours. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] As the smoke particles marked air that originated from the HPS airways, before leaking from the mask, the concentration contours eff ectively represent the probability of encountering air around the patient that has come from within the mask and/or the patient's respiratory system. Th e normalized concentration contours are made up of data collected from at least 20 breaths. A normalized concentration of 100% or a contour value of 1 indicates a region that consists entirely of air exhaled by the patient, where there is a very high chance of exposure to the exhaled air, such as at the mask exhaust vents. A normalized concentration of 0% or a contour value of 0 indicates no measurable air leakage in the region and a small chance of exposure to the exhaled air. Signifi cant exposure was arbitrarily defi ned as where there was \u0546 20% of normalized smoke concentration.

Several groups had applied NIV to patients hospitalized with infl uenza A(H1N1) and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with variable success. [33] [34] [35] Infl uenza A viruses may spread between humans through contact, large respiratory droplets, and small particle droplet nuclei (aerosols). 36, 37 Th ere was evidence of possible aerosol transmission in a nosocomial outbreak of seasonal infl uenza temporally related to the use of NIV in an index patient with acute exacerbation of COPD due to infl uenza A(H3N2) in our acute hospital medical ward with an imbalanced indoor airfl ow. 38 Patients with mild ARDS due to SARI may be considered for a trial of NIV if there is suffi cient local experience. 10, 39 However, NIV is generally regarded as one of the aerosol-generating procedures in which there is possibly increased risk of respiratory pathogen transmission. 11, 40 Th us, it is advisable to apply NIV carefully with airborne precautions in an adequately ventilated room (with 6-12 ACH) when caring for patients with SARI of infectious nature. 10, 12, 13, 40, 41 Based on our study fi ndings, NIV via the helmet with double limb circuit and a good seal at the neck-helmet interface would be a safe option for managing infectious patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to SARI.",

            "text": "Our study was limited by the use of smoke particles as markers for exhaled air. However, evaporation of water content in some droplets during NIV may produce droplet nuclei suspended in air, whereas the larger droplets will fall to the ground in a trajectory pathway. 42 As the smoke particles in this study mark the continuous air phase, our data contours are referring to exhaled air. Our results would therefore represent the \"upper bound\" estimates for the dispersion of droplets, which would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than the air jet because of gravitational eff ects, but not fully refl ect the risk of droplet transmission. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] In summary, we have shown that leakage of exhaled air was negligible when NIV was applied to the HPS via a helmet with double limb circuit, fi lters, and a good seal at the neck interface, whereas leakage at the neck interface could reach a maximum radial distance of 270 mm through another helmet without a tight neck seal. In addition, leakage of exhaled air jet through the exhalation port could reach a distance of 916 mm when NIV was applied via the total face mask and a single circuit. HCWs should take adequate precautions when providing NIV support to patients with SARI complicated by respiratory failure.",
