            "text": "Digital epidemiology can be broadly defined as epidemiology that uses digital methods from data collection to data analysis [1] . The goal of digital epidemiology is identical to that of traditional epidemiology. Then, what is the difference between the two? A narrower definition of digital epidemiology is that which uses digital data that was not generated with the primary purpose of epidemiological studies [2] . Examples of such data include search queries, social media posts, webpage access logs, mobile phone network data, data generated by sensors, and data collected at call centers. A large proportion of sick people search for relevant health information using internet search engines, and many share their experience with the rest of us on social media. Descriptions of health problems, time-stamped and geo-tagged, are available. Thus, it is possible for us to study the health of a population in real time using such digital traces. Researchers have already started to use digital data to support public health surveillance and infectious disease monitoring or to understand public attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors towards health issues.",

According to research carried out by a team at Northeastern University and Harvard University, GFT forecasted twice as many influenza cases as actually occurred in the United States during the 2012-2013 flu season [5] . Furthermore, the estimates cannot be reproduced easily because Google data is not publicly available. Twitter became an alternative data source because anyone with an internet connection can retrieve Twitter data. A group of researchers used data from Twitter to track level of disease activity and concern about the influenza H1N1 pandemic in 2011 [6] . Twitter has also been used to assess health sentiments such as those about vaccination [7] and to monitor drug safety [8] . Wikipedia, another publicly accessible data source, has also been used for digital epidemiology. Researchers at Boston Children's Hospital introduced a method of estimating the level of ILIs, in near-real-time, in the United States by monitoring the rate of influenza-related Wikipedia article views on a daily basis [9] .",

An explorative study investigates the full nature of the phenomenon, the manner in which it manifests, and other related factors through correlation analyses. An example of such a study is Chary et al.

An explanatory study focuses on understanding the underlying causes of a phenomenon or the systematic relationships among variables [13] . An example is Towers et al. [19] , which examined whether news coverage was a significant factor in the temporal patterns of Ebola-related Twitter data using a linear regression model. A predictive and controlled study attempts to predict a phenomenon based on research findings. An example is Ram et al. [20] , which analyzed Twitter, Google [22] . An example of a case-control study is a study by Tourassi et al. [15] , which classified study subjects into a case group (females for whom cancer is the stated or inferred cause of death) or a control group (females for whom there was no mention of cancer) using online obituary announcements in order to examine the association between parity and cancer risk. An example of an intervention study is Edoh's study [16] which conducted an experiment using large range/distance temperature sensors and drones in order to collect infectious diseases-related data from study participants.",

In traditional epidemiological studies, the most frequently used method is cross-sectional regression. However, the use of digital data collected across a time period enables the modeling of effects across time and space. A majority of the studies (76.1%) used external datasets as outcome variables for model development or outcome validation. Regarding outcome measures, incidence and prevalence were the most common measures used in digital epidemiological studies. A majority of the studies used correlation analyses to examine the relationships among variables (55 studies) followed by various regression analyses (45 studies), such as linear regression, jointpoint regression, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression. We examined how digital data collected for non-epidemiological purposes is being used for epidemiologic purposes. Digital epidemiological studies require large datasets and advanced analytics such as machine learning. Most machine learning algorithms are openly available due to the strong open source software movement. Thus, it is important to ensure that as much data as possible are openly accessible. As Salathe [2] elaborated so well in his review article, this is clearly at odds with the desire to have as little personal data as possible publicly accessible to protect individual privacy. There is no straightforward solution to this conflict of interest between open access to large data sets and privacy protection, but Salathe [2] proposed data cooperatives with restricted access as a solution.",
