Several enteropathogens are associated with diarrhea in young calves, with Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection being the most common type of colibacillosis. The rise of antibiotic resistance in a number of medically important bacterial pathogens has revived interest in the use of bacteriophages as anti-bacterial therapeutic agents. Here we describe the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study designed to evaluate the effect of an oral bacteriophage cocktail on fecal E. coli colony-forming units (CFU). Ten calves were enrolled in the study to either the bacteriophage group or the placebo group for 22 feedings. Calves in the bacteriophage treatment group (n= 6) received a total of 10 6 plaque-forming units (PFU) (volume = 5 ml) of each of four bacteriophages while the placebo group (n = 4) received only phosphate-buffered saline (5 ml). Fresh fecal samples and blood samples were collected daily from each calf and analyzed for bacterial count and presence of bacteriophage. E. coli-infecting phages were recovered from all phage-treated calves at concentrations of 10\u00b2 to 10\u00b3 PFU per gram of rectal contents, but none was detected in serum. Phage treatment caused a reduction in fecal E. coli when compared to the control group: the mean log CFU for the placebo-treated group was 9.25 (SE = 0.42) versus 9.11 (SE = 0.34) for the phage-treated group, but the difference was not statistically significant.",

The economic losses associated with this disease are due not only to the resulting mortality, but also to the retarded growth of the animals, the cost of both the veterinary care and the drugs used to treat the infection, and the increased labor involved (de Graaf et al., 1999) . Several enteropathogens are associated with diarrhea in neonatal calves, the most prevalent being Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and rotavirus and coronavirus, with their relative importance varying by geographic region (Snodgrass et al., 1986; Younis et al., 2009) .",

            "text": "Escherichia coli is a gram-negative bacterium normally found in the intestines of most animals. Although most E. coli are nonpathogenic, some are able to cause intestinal and extra intestinal infections. Large numbers of E. coli are present in the farm environment as a result of fecal contamination. Initial exposure to pathogenic E. coli may occur in contaminated calving pens, but systemic infection usually requires predisposing environmental factors, inadequate transfer of passive immunity or compromised immune system by other infection. The most common type of colibacillosis in young animals is caused by the non-invasive Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strains, which are also the leading cause of diarrhea among travelers and children in the developing world (Nagy and Fekete, 2005) . The rise in antibiotic resistance in a number of medically important bacterial pathogens (Denou et al., 2009 ) has revived interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat bacterial infections (Merril et al., 2003) . Phage therapy is considered a potentially low-cost treatment modality and was first implemented by Felix d'Herelle more than 90 years ago. However, the development of antibiotics in the 1940s put a halt to commercial production of therapeutic phages in most Western countries whereas in the Soviet Union, enteric diseases, nosocomial infections, burn and wound infections continued to be treated with phage preparations on a very large scale and apparently with some success (Sulakvelidze, 2005) . Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the effect of oral administration of bacteriophages on fecal E. coli CFU. Additionally, it was also our objective to assess the survivability of the phages and the impact of oral phage administration on calf health. Our one-sided hypothesis was that oral administration of E. coli bacteriophages would cause a reduction in fecal E. coli CFU.",

From May 28, 2009 through June 7, 2009, 4 bull calves were purchased at birth from a local dairy farm plus 6 more at 1 week of age and enrolled in the study at the same time. The calves were randomly chosen and submitted to a physical examination by a veterinarian at the farm. They were commingled on the transport trailer and randomly off-loaded at Cornell University, at which time an identification tag was placed in the right ear and the animals were weighed. The calves were assigned to treatment groups and housing in the order they were removed from the trailer. On the first day of treatment a technical mistake was made and one calf received a different coded bucket from the one he had been assigned to receive. Exclusion of this calf was not necessary because the management for both groups was kept the same and no prior treatment had been given. The calf was moved from his initial group and assigned to the other group.",

Any milk replacer not consumed within 15 min was fed to the animal via an esophageal tube feeder. Freechoice water was available at all times. Stalls were cleaned and bedded daily with pine shavings and steam cleaned with 93\u00b0C (200\u00b0F) pressurized water. Gross manure contamination on the stall walls was also removed daily. Pull-over boots, water buckets, milk buckets, milk bottles, and thermometers were labeled for each treatment group and not shared between calves receiving the different treatments. Calves enrolled in the study received 22 feedings; following the farm management, where each calf receives two feedings of milk per day.

During these two days, blood and manure samples were collected for CFU and PFU quantification as well as for obtaining calf health data. Calves started being monitored for feed intake at all feedings, and received a recorded visual health appraisal twice daily by a veterinarian (blinded to treatment allocation). At each feeding, the following data were recorded: health score, fecal score, weight, and temperature. Calf health was assessed visually by using objective criteria of appetite, fecal consistency, hydration status, respiratory effort, and attitude (Berge et al., 2005) . Calves would have been removed and censored from the study if their clinical status appeared critical at any point during the study period; fortunately, this was not necessary for any calf. A single dose of Flunixin meglumine (Banamine, 50 mg/ml, 2.2 mg/kg, Schering Plough) was used to treat one calf with a depressed attitude. No antibiotic treatment was used during the study period.",

Additionally, the log CFU of the phage-treated group decreased quickly after the first phage treatment was administered, indicating a potential treatment effect. Nevertheless, despite the known in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of the phage cocktail against E. coli strains (Bicalho et al., 2010) , repeated oral application of high titers of phage cocktail did not significantly reduce fecal E. coli CFU. However, the statistical power of our study was limited, given that only 10 calves were enrolled. To evaluate the susceptibility of phages to acidity, an in vitro experiment was carried out in which the phages were exposed to a range of pH values. Dilutions of 10 and 10 showed higher lytic action among all the serial dilutions made in our laboratory. Relative viability was estimated by comparing the phage titer in acidic SM buffer with that in neutral SM buffer, pH 7.5. Phages were nonviable at pH 1 and 2. The effects of higher pH (pH 3-11) on the viability of all 4 phages used in this study were not evident (Fig. 2) .",

The presence of phage in each diluted sample was determined by the occurrence of plaques (clearing zones) in the bacterial lawn. Bacteriophages were recovered only from the treated group, and only after study day 3, 24 h after the first phage treatment (Fig. 3) . E. coli-infecting phages were recovered from all phage-treated calves at concentrations of 10\u00b2-10\u00b3 PFU/g of fecal matter on study days 4 and 5, but no bacteriophages were detected in the feces of control calves. On study day 6, mean phage titers reached approximately 10 PFU/g, and on study days 7-10 the mean phage titers decreased to 10 PFU/g. On study day 11, the final day of the study, the mean phage titer was 10 PFU. Rozema et al. (2009) reported a significant decrease in E. coli O157:H7 in orally bacteriophage-treated adult cattle compared to steers who received the treatment by rectal application. They concluded that the longer retention time experienced by the orally administered phages within the digestive tract, with the digesta being present in both liquid and solid phases, increased the opportunity for the phages to interact with their target E. coli cells and replicate, thereby increasing both the phage population size and the likelihood of infection of additional E. coli cells.",

Denou et al.(2009) , using mice, found lower phage titers in the cecum and large intestine compared to the initial amount of phages added to the drinking water. Those authors mentioned the acidity of the mouse stomach (pH = 3) as a possible explanation for the phage loss. However, the findings of Bruttin and Br\u00fcssow (2005) suggest that there is considerable phage stability during gastrointestinal transit in humans, as the authors were able to detect phages in all fecal samples of volunteers who had ingested phages in drinking water at a concentration of 10 pfu/ml.",

The predator-prey relationship between phages and their targeted bacteria is exemplified in the work of Tanji et al., 2003. In that study, when the populations of E. coli O157:H7 in waste-water streams increased so did the populations of bacteriophage that were active against E. coli O157:H7. This is because the host specificity of each phage depends on its ability to recognize specific cell-surface receptors (Tanji et al., 2003) . Such strain specificity could be an explanation for the observation that the stool samples of the control group did not present any phages (environmental in origin), because the host used for phage enumeration was an E. coli strain isolated from the uterus of a metritic dairy cow.",
