Haemophagocytic syndrome is caused by a dysregulation in natural killer T-cell function, resulting in activation and proliferation of lymphocytes or histiocytes with uncontrolled haemophagocytosis and cytokine overproduction. The syndrome is characterised by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, liver dysfunction, and hyperferritinaemia. Haemophagocytic syndrome can be either primary, with a genetic aetiology, or secondary, associated with malignancies, autoimmune diseases, or infections. Infections associated with haemophagocytic syndrome are most frequently caused by viruses, particularly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We present a case of EBV-associated haemophagocytic syndrome in a young adult with no known immunosuppression. We briefl y review haemophagocytic syndrome and then discuss its associated infections, particularly EBV and other herpes viruses, HIV, infl uenza, parvovirus, and hepatitis viruses, as well as bacterial, fungal, and parasitic organisms.",

However, this distinction may be artifi cial. First, primary haemophagocytic syndrome can occur at any age, not just during infancy or early childhood. 3 Second, an underlying genetic mutation is found in only 40% of all primary haemophagocytic syndrome patients. 1 Third, both primary and secondary syndromes can be precipitated by an infection, 4 and fi nally, some secondary cases of haemophagocytic syndrome carry a higher mortality than those seen in primary haemophagocytic syndrome.",

Diagnostic guidelines were proposed by the Histiocyte Society in 1991 14 and updated in 2004 (panel 2). 15 Since therapy can be life saving and some of the clinical criteria occur late in disease, it is not necessary to fulfi l all criteria before initiating therapy. Main symptoms of haemo phagocytic syndrome are fever and splenomegaly. Jaundice, hepatomegaly, lymph adenopathy, rash, and neurological signs are also common (table 1). The hallmark laboratory fi nding is cytopenia, which can be profound. There is also marked liver dysfunction; an elevated ferritin level is characteristic (table 2). Two highly diagnostic parameters are an increased plasma concentration of the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25) and impaired NK-cell activity. The elevation of interleukin-2 receptor in haemophagocytic syndrome suggests the activation of T lymphocytes and correlates with prognosis. 16 On histopathology, activated macrophages with engulfed leucocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, and their precursor cells are the typical fi nding. The haemophagocytosis can be seen in any organ, particularly in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. If haemophagocytosis is absent in an initial biopsy specimen, the biopsy needs to be repeated.",

Since haemophagocytic syndrome is rare, no randomised controlled clinical trials testing potential treatments have been done. The immediate aim of therapy is suppression of the increased infl ammatory response and control of cell proliferation using immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents and cytotoxic drugs. Treatment diff ers in children and adults and depends on the underlying disease, the presence of a trigger, and the severity of symptoms. For patients with reactive haemophagocytic syndrome associated with an infectious pathogen other than leishmaniasis, supportive care should be initiated since pathogen-direct therapy is not suffi cient by itself to control the disease. Apart from cases of EBV, treatment of the underlying infection alone in reactive haemophagocytic syndrome is associated with recovery in 60-70% of patients. 7 Chemotherapy using dexamethasone, cyclosporin, and etoposide was adopted by the Histiocyte Society in 1994 17,18 (updated in 2004) 15 and is used for severe (particularly familial and EBV-associated haemophagocytic syndrome) cases. For patients with genetic haemophagocytic syndrome and severe or refractory haemophagocytic syndrome, bone marrow transplantation should be considered. In a review of 122 patients, Arico and co-workers 19 found that bone marrow transplantation recipients had a superior outcome compared with non-transplanted patients (66% vs 10% recovered, respectively). The HLH-94 study, which combined the chemotherapy protocol with bone marrow transplantation in 113 children, showed a probability of survival at 3 years of 56% for all cases (63 of 113 children survived) and 52% for proven familial cases (13 of 25 children survived). 18 Reports of spontaneous regression have been described. 20 Monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD20 [rituximab] and anti-interleukin-2R\u03b1 receptor [daclizumab]) have been used in the setting of rheumatic disease or malignancy ",

In a limited number of individuals, EBV infects NK T cells and induces EBV-persistent infection with monoclonal or oligoclonal proliferation.

            "text": "13 patients with HHV8-associated haemophagocytic syndrome have been described in the literature. Most of these cases occurred in the setting of Kaposi's sarcoma or multicentric Castleman's disease, and in immunocompromised hosts (eight patients were HIV positive and two patients were renal transplantation recipients). [43] [44] [45] Nine of the 13 patients recovered; fi ve had been treated with an etoposide-containing regimen and four had been treated with ganciclovir and foscarnet. [43] [44] [45] HIV HIV alone or in the presence of other opportunistic and non-opportunistic infections or malignancies has been associated with haemophagocytic syndrome. Although the association between HIV and haemophagocytic syndrome is rare, it is likely that the condition is underdiagnosed since HIV and haemophagocytic syndrome share many clinical and laboratory similarities. Around 10% of bone marrow biopsies in HIV patients before initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showed haemophagocytosis. 46 In one autopsy study, haemo phagocytosis was found in 20% of 56 HIV patients. 47 In a recent review of 39 patients with HIV-associated haemophagocytic syndrome, 48 82% were male, median age was 38 years (range 26-59 years), and 11 patients had no opportunistic infection or malignancy, suggesting a possible role of HIV itself in triggering haemophagocytic syndrome. 90% of patients had fever, 67% hepatomegaly, and 55% splenomegaly. Pancytopenia was very common. 80% of patients had a CD4-cell count of less than 200 cells per \u00b5L (mean 132 cells per \u00b5L). Recovery was noted in only 28% of patients. A worse outcome was seen in patients with a CD4-cell count of less than 200 cells per \u00b5L. In 15 patients where information regarding treatment was available, only three received antiretroviral drugs and one responded to HAART. 49 Two patients received chemotherapy that did not consist of the haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis protocol. Intravenous immunoglobulin (in six patients), steroids (fi ve patients), and splenectomy (two patients) were occasionally used.",

Reactive haemo phagocytosis is the most common pathological fi nding. 57,58 A recombinant haemagglutinin (H5) from an H5N1 virus may suppress perforin Grand Round expression in human CD8+ T cells and may reduce the cytotoxicity of these cells, preventing them from killing H5-bearing cells. The resulting persistence of H5-bearing cells leads to a marked lymphoproliferation and interferon-\u03b3 hyperproduction with macrophage overactivation. 59 Since mortality caused by H5N1-associated haemophagocytic syndrome is high (around 50%) and antiviral drugs can be ineff ective, some authors suggest treatment with a modifi ed HLH-94 protocol 60 with a shorter course of etoposide and dexamethasone. However, in a randomised study from Vietnam, all patients with H5N1-associated haemophagocytic syndrome died despite receiving steroids. 61 ",
