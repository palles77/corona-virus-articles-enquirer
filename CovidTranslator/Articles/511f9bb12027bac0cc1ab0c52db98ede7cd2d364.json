Westropp B acterial infections of the genitourinary tract include uncomplicated and complicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs); prostatitis; pyelonephritis; renal abscesses; epididymitis and orchitis; and vaginitis, metritis, and pyometra. Infections of the genitourinary tract usually follow impairment of normal host defenses and invasion by bacteria that are part of the normal flora. Less commonly, infection results from hematogenous spread of bacteria to urogenital organs. Specific pathogens such as Leptospira spp. that injure the kidneys secondary to systemic infection are described elsewhere in this book.",

Factors that prevent bacterial colonization of the bladder include the glycosaminoglycan layer that covers bladder transitional epithelium, frequent voiding, the normal urethral microflora, antimicrobial properties of urine, an appropriate host immune response, and a functional urethral sphincter. Commensal bacteria that reside in the distal urethra, prepuce, and vagina invade opportunistically when these mechanisms are disturbed. The most common pathogen involved in all genitourinary tract infections is Escherichia coli, which has a particular propensity to adhere to epithelial cells of the genitourinary tract. Others include coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci; Enterococcus spp.; other aerobic gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Corynebacterium spp.; streptococci; and mycoplasmas. Anaerobic bacteria can also be found in the genital tracts of female dogs and can contribute to pyometra and metritis when host defenses are impaired. In addition to impaired host defenses, a variety of bacterial virulence factors influence the ability of certain bacteria to ultimately invade tissues and cause disease. Virulence factors of uropathogenic E. coli are described in more detail in Chapter 36.",

Although mixed bacterial infections can occur, the vast majority of UTIs involve a single bacterial species. 1 The most common uropathogen isolated is E. coli, which accounts for approximately 50% of all isolates, followed by Staphylococcus, Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus species. Mycoplasmas have also been isolated from dogs with UTIs, although their clinical significance can be unclear because they are usually isolated from dogs that have other disorders of the lower urinary tract, such as underlying neoplasia or cystolithiasis. Spayed females and older dogs are at increased risk for bacterial UTIs; the mean age at diagnosis is 7 to 8 years of age. 1, 2 As a result of breakdown in host defense mechanisms, systemic disorders such as acute or chronic kidney disease, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, and systemic neoplasia also predispose dogs to UTIs (Table 89-1) .",

When UTIs do occur in young adult cats, they are generally secondary to catheterization, perineal urethrostomy, or rarely, congenital anatomical defects. In older cats, sporadic bacterial infection of the bladder in an otherwise apparently healthy individual with normal urinary tract anatomy and function. 15 It has been estimated that uncomplicated UTI occurs in 14% of dogs that visit a veterinarian during their lifetime. 16 However, the actual prevalence of simple uncomplicated UTI may actually be lower, because abnormalities in host defenses probably go unrecognized in many dogs. As noted earlier, uncomplicated UTI is rare in cats. Complicated UTIs are associated with concurrent disorders that predispose to recurrent or persistent UTI (see Table 89 -1).",

This has generally been referred to as subclinical UTI in the veterinary literature. The use of the term subclinical bacteriuria in animals and its distinction from infection (which implies invasion of host tissues by bacteria and the associated inflammatory response) has been controversial, because subtle signs of infection (such as bladder pain, pollakiuria, or intermittent hematuria) may not always be detected. The term subclinical UTI could perhaps be applied to dogs and cats if cytologic evidence of infection (e.g., pyuria or hematuria) is present, 15 but in human patients, the term subclinical bacteriuria is used even when pyuria is present. Subclinical bacteriuria or subclinical UTIs are commonly detected in dogs and cats, especially those with underlying endocrinopathies, renal failure, or neurologic disease, as well as dogs treated with glucocorticoids or cyclosporine. 7, 8, [18] [19] [20] In a study of dogs treated with glucocorticoids for dermatologic disorders, 18% of 127 dogs had bacteriuria in the absence of clinical signs, whereas none of 94 dogs that had not received glucocorticoids had bacteriuria.",

Pyelonephritis may be acute or chronic. Strains of E. coli that cause pyelonephritis have greater ability to adhere to cells than strains that cause cystitis. Adhesins located on the tip of E. coli fimbriae (P fimbriae) adhere to glycolipid residues on tubular, collecting duct, and bladder epithelial cells. In human pyelonephritis, both P and type I fimbriae are important in colonization of the renal pelvis. 21, 22 Other E. coli virulence factors associated with pyelonephritis include hemolysin, cytotoxic necrotizing factor, the iron scavenger aerobactin, and a serum protease known as Sat. Fimbriae are also important in the pathogenesis of Proteus pyelonephritis. 23 The renal medulla is more sensitive to colonization than the cortex, possibly owing to impaired host defenses in a high osmolality, low pH, and low blood flow milieu. Organisms adhere to pelvic, distal, and proximal tubular epithelium and have been observed intracellularly. Considerable renal injury results from the inflammatory response to infection.

Although any pathogens isolated from specimens collected by cystocentesis are likely significant, bacterial contamination from the skin is possible; therefore, the presence of more than 10 3 CFU/mL of bacteria is considered clinically significant. If specimens are collected via catheterization, colony counts that exceed 10 4 CFU/mL for male dogs and 10 5 CFU/mL for female dogs are considered clinically significant. 15 Free-catch (midstream voiding) specimen collection should not be used for dogs or cats because it is highly susceptible to contamination. A positive aerobic bacterial culture of a cystocentesis-collected urine specimen confirms the presence of bacterial infection in animals that have LUTS. Culture can also help to differentiate re-infection from relapse should a UTI return; if the second isolate is a different bacterial species or has a different antibiotic susceptibility pattern (also known as an antibiogram), reinfection is likely. 15 Specimens for culture should be refrigerated immediately and submitted to the laboratory as soon as possible. For specimens that reach the laboratory more than 24 hours after collection, culture results should be interpreted with caution, because falsenegative and false-positive test results can occur.

Cytologic examination of stained urine sediment may assist in initial selection of an antimicrobial drug (i.e., based on the presence of rods versus cocci). The use of a fluoroquinolone that is excreted in the urine in active form (i.e., not difloxacin) is recommended for gram-negative bacterial pyelonephritis, provided regional susceptibility data do not show widespread resistance to fluoroquinolones. 15 The dosage used may need to be reduced if severe renal impairment is present. If combination treatment is initiated and antimicrobial susceptibility test results show susceptibility to only one drug, the other drug should be discontinued. Treatment for 4 to 6 weeks is recommended, although shorter periods of treatment may be effective and require further study. Dogs with acute pyelonephritis may need hospitalization and treatment with intravenous fluids and other medications for acute renal failure or sepsis. Urinalysis and culture should ideally be performed after 7 days of treatment and again 7 days after treatment has been discontinued, to ensure that infection has been eliminated. If the same organism is isolated again, then an additional antimicrobial drug with in vitro activity against the organism could be added. Struvite nephrolithiasis (such as \"staghorn\" calculi) or struvite cystoliths may dissolve with antimicrobial treatment, although dietary intervention may also be needed in some cases. When stones are present, antimicrobial treatment should be continued until there is no radiographic or ultrasonographic evidence of calculi and the urine is sterile. Other calculi such as calcium oxalate, urate and cystine can predispose animals to recurrent bacterial infections and, if possible, should be removed. While dissolution protocols are described for urate and cystine, they often are not as rewarding as struvite. Calcium oxalate stones are not amenable to dissolution with dietary or antimicrobial therapy.",

A CBC showed a hematocrit of 50% and persistent thrombocytopenia (51,000 platelets/ \u00b5L). An abdominal ultrasound showed a 2.9-cm right renal pelvic nephrolith and a 7-mm left renal pelvic nephrolith.",

There was no vulvar discharge and no evidence of perivulvar dermatitis. A slightly recessed vulva was present. Treatment: Molly was treated with enrofloxacin (7 mg/kg PO q24h). The following day her platelet count increased to 31,000 platelets/\u00b5L, and by day 3 of treatment it was 64,000 platelets/\u00b5L. After 7 days of treatment, a CBC showed a neutrophil count of 5700/\u00b5L and no band neutrophils, and the platelet count was 79,000 platelets/\u00b5L. A urine culture obtained by cystocentesis at this time showed 10 4 CFU/mL of E. coli and E. faecalis. The E. coli was resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, enrofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, but susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (64 \u00b5g/mL). The susceptibility of the E. faecalis had not changed, with the exception that the MIC for tetracycline was 32 \u00b5g/mL. Treatment was changed to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (23 mg/kg PO q12h). When reevaluated 3 weeks later, Molly had no clinical signs of illness. A CBC showed only mild thrombocytopenia (146,000 platelets/\u00b5L, with an MPV of 12.6 fL). However, bacteria and large numbers of white blood cells were still present in the urine sediment, the urine pH was 8.0, and E. coli with the same susceptibility pattern was again isolated from the urine. An extended panel showed susceptibility to amikacin (\u22644 \u00b5g/mL) and imipenem-cilastatin (\u22641 \u00b5g/mL), but resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefpodoxime, cephalothin, gentamicin, marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid. The dosage of clavulanic amoxicillinclavulanic acid was increased to 23 mg/kg PO q8h. The diet was changed to a commercial urolith dissolution diet (Hill's s/d Canine Dissolution diet). After an additional month, urinalysis findings were unchanged and the same E. coli was again isolated from the urine. The platelet count was 244,000 platelets/\u00b5L and a biochemistry panel was unremarkable. Abdominal radiographs and ultrasound showed no evidence of nephrolithiasis, but multiple small, rounded mineral opacities were present in the region of the right ureter. Antimicrobial drug treatment was ultimately changed to amikacin (15 mg/kg SC q24h) 2 weeks later because an E. coli was isolated that was resistant to clavulanic acid-amoxicillin. Kidney values were monitored every 2 weeks during amikacin treatment to evaluate for nephrotoxicity. The urine then became sterile, and ultrasound examination showed disappearance of all urinary calculi over a 2-month period, after which antimicrobial drug treatment was discontinued and the diet was changed to a maintenance diet. Because of the recessed vulva and the dog's excess body condition, a weight loss program was discussed with the owner. Molly was diagnosed with a subclinical Enterobacter aerogenes UTI 2 months later, which was broadly susceptible to antimicrobial drugs and treated with enrofloxacin. The platelet count was within the reference range. Further evaluation for underlying conditions predisposing to recurrent UTIs (contrast cystourethrography and cystoscopy), followed by vulvoplasty if no other abnormalities were detected, were offered to the owners but they declined further treatment and evaluation. The dog remained alive, untreated, and without clinical signs 4 years later, at which time CBC and biochemistry panel results were unremarkable but MDR E. coli was repeatedly isolated from the urine.",

            "text": "Comments: This is an interesting case of bacterial cystitis and pyelonephritis associated with struvite nephrolithiasis, and probable secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. The struvite urolithiasis was likely secondary to the P. mirabilis infection, because P. mirabilis produces urease. Months of antimicrobial treatment were necessary because of bacterial sequestration within urinary calculi. This may have explained continued isolation of bacteria from the urine in the face of antimicrobial drug treatment, although ultimately resolution of the E. coli infection quickly followed the change in antimicrobial drug choice. Meropenem would have been another appropriate choice based on the susceptibility of the organism isolated, but its use in animals is controversial because it is an important option for treatment of serious resistant bacterial infections in humans. Fortunately, dissolution of the nephroliths occurred in this case with antimicrobial and dietary therapy, and surgery to remove infected uroliths was not required. Continued UTIs were a likely sequela in this dog in the absence of successful identification and treatment of an underlying cause. Although treatment of the UTI was necessary during nephrolith dissolution, treatment of the subclinical E. aerogenes infection may not have been necessary.",
