To accurately identify epitopes on S1D, the S1-phage library containing the gene encoding the S1D region of PEDV S protein was micropanned by six specific monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) against the S1D region. These micropanned epitope regions (MER) were focused on 696-779 amino acids of the S protein. To further map epitopes of the MER, seven overlapping minifragments covering MER nucleotides were separately synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 with a GST tag. These mini-GST fusion proteins were scanned by ELISA and Western blotting with the six McAbs, and the result showed that S1D5 (residues 744-759) and S1D6 (residues 756-771) are two linear epitopes of the PEDV S protein. The antisera of the epitopes S1D5 and S1D6 could react with the native S protein of PEDV. Furthermore, Pepscan of the two linear epitopes demonstrated that SS2 ( 748 YSNIGVCK 755 ) and SS6 ( 764 LQDGQVKI 771 ) are two core epitopes on S1D5 and S1D6, respectively, located on the S protein of PEDV. #",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious, enteric disease of swine caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death, and has a mortality rate of up to 90% (Pensaert and Debouck, 1978; Timoney et al., 1998) . Since PED was first reported in Belgium and the UK in 1978, the disease has frequently broken out in many swine-raising countries and has led to severe economic losses in Asia, notably in China, Japan and Korea (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978; Takahashi et al., 1983; Kweon et al., 1993; Fan and Li, 2005) . www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Veterinary Microbiology 131 (2008) [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] PEDV is an enveloped, positive-sense, singlestranded RNA virus, which belongs to the genus Coronavirus, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. The genome of PEDV is approximately 30 kb in length. Subgenomic mRNAs of PEDV are transcribed from its genome RNA, and then are translated to produce viral proteins such as spike protein (S, 180-220 kDa), membrane protein (M, 27-32 kDa) and nucleocapsid protein (N, 55-58 kDa) (Egberink et al., 1988; Holmes, 2001; Brian and Baric, 2005) . The S protein, a glycoprotein peplomer on the viral surface, plays an important role in induction of neutralizing antibodies, specific receptor binding and cell membrane fusion (Duarte and Laude, 1994; Li et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2005) . These properties make the S protein a suitable candidate for genetic engineering of vaccines and diagnostic reagents.",

The anti-S1D antibodies showed neutralizing activity for PEDV-infected Vero cells (Sun et al., 2007a) . In order to provide some basis for the development of vaccines and diagnostic reagents, it is necessary to map the antigenic epitopes of the S1D region and accurately determine important residues in these epitopes. In this study, one micropanned epitope region of S1D (MER: residues 696-779) was identified by fd-tet phage display using six monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) . Further analysis of the MER was carried out by ELISA, Western blotting and Pepscan using the six McAbs.

Like those of other coronaviruses, the PEDV S protein plays an important role in inducing neutralizing antibodies (Duarte and Laude, 1994; Kang et al., 2006) .

First, one epitope region (MER) was identified on the S1D region of PEDV S protein by phage display. Epitopes could not be determined accurately because the inserts expressed on the surface of the recombinant phages were overlength (approximately 200-300 bp). Second, more accurate identification of the epitopes was performed based on the method described by Hua, and two linear epitopes, S1D5 and S1D6, were determined in the MER (Hua et al., 2004) . Antibodies against the epitopes S1D5 and S1D6 could react with native S protein of PEDV in ELISA, but the antibodies induced by the epitopes S1D5 and S1D6 had no neutralizing activity for PEDV-infected Vero cells. The epitopes S1D5 and S1D6 are 16 amino acids in length and have four Fig. 3 . Reactivity of antisera against the epitopes S1D5 and S1D6 with PEDV by ELISA. Fig. 4 . Pepscan of the epitopes S1D5 and S1D6 with McAbs. overlapping amino acids. Generally, linear epitopes are short stretches of the primary structure of proteins and consist of six to nine or more continuous amino acid residues. The Pepscan method was used to identify core amino acids on epitopes S1D5 and S1D6, the result showed that the core amino acids were located at amino acids 748-755 (SS2) and amino acids 764-771 (SS6), respectively. It was found that epitopes SS2 and SS6 were adjacent to epitope S1P3 (residues 697-742) in the primary structure of S protein. The epitope S1P3 was identified previously by phage display using native antisera against PEDV (Sun et al., 2007b) . This result suggests that epitopes SS2, SS6 and S1P3 represent a considerable immunodominant region of PEDV S protein.",

However, the S1 domain (residues 1-789) and the S2 domain (residues 790-1383) have been artificially defined by the conserved nonamer and the GxCx motifs at the position of S protein cleavage sites in coronavirus group II members (Follis et al., 2006) . Based on bioinformatics analysis of the S protein structure of other coronaviruses, the S1 domain is thought to form the spherical head of the S protein, and is easily accessible to neutralizing antibodies. The S2 domain forms the stem portion and trans-membrane structure of the S protein, and it seldom induces antibodies because of the inaccessibility of this region in intact virions (Holmes, 2001; Wu et al., 2004; De Haan et al., 2006) .
