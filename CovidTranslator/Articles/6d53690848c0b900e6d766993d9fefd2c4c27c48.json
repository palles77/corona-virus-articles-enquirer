            "text": "RNA pseudoknots play an important role in many biological processes. They build the catalytic core of some ribozymes (1, 2) and are an important building block of many structural RNAs. Pseudoknots are involved in telomerase activity (3) and they stimulate efficient programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), a mechanism used by a wide range of RNA viruses to encode two proteins within one genomic region. In a recent study (4) over a thousand of potential -1 PRF signals were detected in the yeast genome. The majority of signals however seem to direct the ribosome to premature termination codons. This suggests a mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. Further genome wide studies have to elucidate this phenomenon. This and many more applications require fast RNA folding algorithms, that are also capable of folding pseudoknots.",

While the standard methods need time proportional to the cube of the input sequence length, pseudoknot prediction is much more demanding. This issue has attracted a large body of bio-informatics work, where all approaches either abandon the model of free energy minimization, or make restrictions on the class of pseudoknots that can be recognized. The well-known algorithm by Rivas and Eddy (7) , which is able to predict a restricted class of pseudoknots, needs O(n 6 ) time and O(n 4 ) memory space, where n is the sequence length. Even more restrictive, but more efficient by two orders of magnitude is the program pknotsRG by Reeder and Giegerich (8) , requiring O(n 4 ) time and O(n 2 ) space. The new method presented here re-implements and extends this approach in several significant ways.",

In such a situation, alternative near-optimal structures may be better predictions.

Since only two helices participate in one pseudoknot, we loop over all possible knots in one O(n 4 ) loop and store the result in a two-dimensional matrix. More detailed, for a pseudoknot between bases i and j, the algorithm enumerates all k and l, such that i5k5l5j. The first pseudoknot helix (a in Figure 2 ) starts at base pair i and l, the second (b) at position k and j. Now, we make use of our canonization: The maximal length of a helix can be pre-computed and stored in a two-dimensional array. Therefore, after choosing position k and l, the algorithm looks up the maximal helix lengths, h for (i, l) and h 0 for (k, j) and checks the applicability of Rule 3. Having the stems fixed, the location of the three enclosed pseudoknot loops (u,v,w in Figure 2 ) follows directly: loop u ranges from position i \u00fe h \u00fe 1 to k\u00c01, loop v from k \u00fe h 0 \u00fe1 to l\u00c0h\u00c01, and loop w from l \u00fe 1 to j\u00c0h 0 \u00c01. The best folding for these smaller subsequences has already been computed earlier in the DP scheme. The energy sum of the two pseudoknot helices and the loop folding energies gives us the total pseudoknot energy. The minimal one over all k and l, is stored is the two-dimensional pseudoknot matrix. This value competes with values of unknotted foldings for the interval (i, j).",

For each suboptimal structure s, the threshold is reduced by the energy difference to the optimal structure and the backtrace procedure is called recursively on the substructures of s, yet with a smaller threshold. At some point the threshold falls below 0, which means no further suboptimal structure within the user-defined energy band can arise from this backtrace.",
