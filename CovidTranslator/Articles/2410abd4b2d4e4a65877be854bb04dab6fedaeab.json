This study provides functional evidence for a direct access of peptides to the human brain after intranasal administration. Effects were compared of intranasal (IN, 10/~g) and intravenous (IV, 0.25 and 2.5 pg) administered cholecystokinin-8 (CCK) on the auditory event related potential (AERP) in 20 healthy subjects. Also, plasma concentration of cortisol and ACTH were monitored. The study was designed as a placebo-controlled, double-blind within-subject cross-over comparison. AERPs were recorded while the subject performed on an attention task (oddball task). Plasma CCK concentrations after IN administration of CCK were comparable to those after IV administration of 0.25 #g CCK, but were substantially lower than those after 2.5 #g CCK. The P3 complex of the AERP was markedly increased following the IN administration of CCK (p < .01) compared to placebo and to the IV administration of 0.25 Izg. This pattern was more obvious in women than men. Increases in plasma ACTH concentrations after CCK reached significance selectively following the IN mode of administration (p < .01).",

Although changes in central nervous information processing have also been shown in human subjects after IV administration of peptides such as corticotropin (ACTH), vasopressin and cholecystokinin (CCK), the effects in general appeared to be more difficult to demonstrate. This could be ascribed in part to the limited access of blood-borne peptides to the central nervous system. The central nervous effects of peptides after IV administration have been considered to be mediated via stimulation of afferent nerves in the case of CCK (Smith et al., 1981) or via the circumventricular organs, which lack the bloodbrain barrier and contain a large number of specific binding sites for peptides such as ACTH or CCK (Weindl & Sofroniew, 1981; Van der Kooy, 1984) . Also, for some peptides like vasopressin and insulin, saturable active carrier mechanisms have been detected at the blood-brain barrier (Banks & Kastin, 1987; Pardridge et al., 1985; Zlokovic et al., 1990) .",

For this purpose, effects of cholecystokinin on AERPs were compared for the IN and IV routes of administration. CCK is a common peptide hormone in the brain and gut. In mesolimbic-frontocortical neuronal pathways it is co-localized with dopamine (Freeman et al., 1991; H6kfelt et al., 1980; Oeth & Lewis, 1992) . Disturbances in these pathways are assumed to account for attentional deficits (Pycock et al., 1980) , which are a crucial symptom of psychosis (Baribeau-Braun et al., 1983) . Anti-psychotic effects of CCK and its analogs have been demonstrated (Montgomery & Green, 1988; Nair et al., 1983; Van Ree et al., 1984) , however other studies failed (Lotstra et al., 1984; Tamminga et al., 1986) . In healthy subjects, CCK-like peptides were found to enhance AERP indicators of attention such as the processing negativity (Pietrowsky et al., 1990 (Pietrowsky et al., , 1993 Schreiber et al., 1995) .",

Like in the present study, effects of ceruletide concentrated on the slow wave component of the P3 complex, which has been considered a reflection of further cortical processing of the task-relevant target stimuli (Johnson & Donchin, 1985) . Effects in this study were also more pronounced in women than men. Although this effect may be attributed to the smaller body mass of the women, the failure to demonstrate differences in plasma CCK-levels between the sexes and the independence of the P3 increase from circulating CCK argue against this interpretation. Rather, the women's brain seems to be more sensitive to effects of CCK. Accordingly, central nervous effects of CCK are modulated by estrogens (Karlsson et al., 1992; Oro et al., 1988) .",

However, passage via this route is time consuming and takes up to several days, thus excluding that this mechanism may account for the present effects after IN CCK. Alternatively, proteins may pass through intercellular clefts in the olfactory epithelium to reach the olfactory axons, and to diffuse along these axons into the central nervous system, as has been demonstrated for horseradish peroxidase (Balin et al., 1986) . Substances entering the brain via this route may pass within 45 min from the nose to the brain (Balin et al., 1986) .

The VNO, which is present in most adult people (Garcfa-Velasco & Mondragon, 1991) , is a chemosensory organ differing in morphology and neuroanatomical connections from the olfactory system. It is particularly involved in the transduction of pheromones (Monti-Bloch et al., 1994) to the CNS and in the regulation of sexual behavior, mainly via LHRH, which is contained in its afferent nerves (Meredith & Fernandez-Fewell, 1994) . While peptidergic information may be transduced via specific receptors in the VNO, an axonal transport of peptides along the nerves of the VNO, as described for the olfactory system, may also occur and is already shown for horseradish peroxidase (Itaya, 1987) . Until now, no specific receptors for CCK-like substances have been demonstrated in the VNO. However, since the CCK-like substance ceruletide is present in amphibian skin, a phylogenetic role of ceruletide as a pheromone can not be excluded. Thus, as a phylogenetic relict, receptors for ceruletide may be present in the human VNO, which also bind to CCK-8.",

Nevertheless, the effect of CCK after IV administration being significantly smaller than after IN administration suggests a limited uptake of the peptide from systemic blood. However, a saturable transduction of information across the blood-brain barrier about peripheral CCKlevels can also occur by a limited receptor mediated carrier mechanism involving second messengers at the cirumventricular organs or at vagal afferents (Carter & Lightman, 1987; Smith & Gibbs, 1984) .",
