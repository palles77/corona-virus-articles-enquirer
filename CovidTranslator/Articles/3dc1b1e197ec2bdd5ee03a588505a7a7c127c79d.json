Rapid diagnosis has been a challenge that may be amenable to molecular point-ofcare testing (POCT). Methods We performed a prospective observational study of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. There were 44 elite athletes and 68 staff members. The chief physician recorded the symptoms of the common cold daily on a standardised form. Two nasal swabs were taken at the onset of symptoms. One swab was analysed within 45 min using a molecular POCT for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B viruses. After the Games, the other swab was tested for 16 possible causative respiratory viruses using PCR in laboratory-based testing. Results 20 out of 44 (45%) athletes and 22 out of 68 (32%) staff members experienced symptoms of the common cold during a median stay of 21 days. Eleven (26%) samples tested virus-positive using POCT. All subjects with influenza (n=6) and 32 close contacts were treated with oseltamivir. The aetiology of the common cold was finally detected in 75% of the athletes and 68 % of the staff members. Seven virus clusters were identified. They were caused by coronaviruses 229E, NL63 and OC43, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus. The virus infections spread readily within the team, most commonly within the same sport discipline. Conclusions The cold was indeed a common illness in Team Finland during the Winter Olympic Games. POCT proved to be clinically valuable, especially for influenza. The aetiology of the common cold was identified in most cases.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Air travel, human crowding, housing with other athletes and competition all increase the susceptibility of an elite athlete to the common cold. 6 The Winter Olympic Games take place during periods of low temperatures and its timing coincides with epidemics of many respiratory viruses. The common cold has been said to be 'the most dreaded opponent' at the Winter Olympic Games, and may ruin the athlete's long-term goal of success. 7 The common cold is a prevalent, complex and heterogeneous illness. 8 More than 10 species of respiratory viruses exist, and they contain hundreds of subspecies with different immunopathologies. 9 10 Signs and symptoms of different viral infections overlap, and it is not possible to identify the aetiological agent on clinical grounds alone. 11 12 Antiviral treatment is only available for influenza, but virus-specific preventive measures may reduce the transmission of illnesses. 13 14 The aim of our prospective observational study was to investigate the occurrence and aetiology of the common cold in Team Finland during the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. We used recently developed molecular multiplexed POCT for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus at the Games site. 15 16 After the Games, we used laboratory-based PCR testing to detect 16 possible causative respiratory viruses.",

Monitoring of the common cold was provided to Team Finland members who stayed in the Olympic Village (45 athletes and 46 supportive staff members) and the two hotels outside the village (22 staff members) (figure 1). The mean age of the athletes (n=45) was 27 (SD 6) years and the mean age of the staff members (n=68) was 44 (SD 9). Thirteen athletes and 10 staff members were female. The team members participated in the monitoring for the entire duration of their Olympic trip, starting from their departure from Helsinki airport and finishing with their return to Helsinki airport, thus including two intercontinental flights with duration of 8 hours 50 min and 9 hours 50 min. On their departure, all team members were reported to be asymptomatic and healthy, except one subject with nasal congestion.

The extracted nucleic acids were stored at \u221270\u00b0C between analyses. Allplex Respiratory Panels 1-4 (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) and the CFX96 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA) instrument were used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions to detect respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, parainfluenza type 1-4 viruses, human coronavirus 229E, OC43 and NL63, human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus using 8 \u00b5L of each specimen per panel. The AllPlex Respiratory Panel also detected the following bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. A laboratory-designed triplex RT-PCR assay for influenza A, A/H1pdm09 and B viruses was performed as described earlier, with the exception that NxtScript DNA Master (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and Mic PCR instrument (Bio Molecular Systems, Upper Coomera, QLD, Queensland, Australia) were used for the PCR step. 18 In addition, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were detected using a triplex RT-PCR assay as described earlier, with the exception that Sensi-FAST Probe No-ROX kit (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany), and Mic PCR instrument were used for the PCR step. 19 A virus cluster was defined as three detections of the same virus during the median length of 3 weeks. This was considered an unusual aggregation event.",

All available POCT virus diagnoses (positive and negative) were later confirmed at a laboratory. Diagnostics had clinical implications in the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B infections. In addition to early treatment with oseltamivir, POCT enabled effective post-contact oseltamivir prophylaxis for close contacts, for example, those living in the same accommodation or travelling on the same flight or in the same vehicle. 14 The isolation of infected team members was initiated after the onset of symptoms and continued for 3-4 days (ie, the most infectious period). [24] [25] [26] [27] We detected the probable causative virus in 75% of the elite athletes with the common cold. Causality is supported by a 4%-6% occurrence of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic adults. 28 29 Only two earlier studies carried out in Australia in warm climate conditions have investigated the viral aetiology of acute respiratory symptoms in summer sport elite athletes. In one study the recovery rate was 29% and in the other it was 27%. 30 31 These low detection rates led to the commonly cited conclusion that in the majority of cases the symptoms could be due to non-infectious airway inflammation. Our observations in winter sport athletes do not support that conclusion. The virus recovery rate of 75% in elite athletes is as high as in other aetiological studies in adults. 9 10 A higher viral recovery rate in adults may not be obtained because PCR tests may detect only 50%-90% of serologically diagnosed respiratory virus infections. 13 32 The occurrence of respiratory infections tended to be more common in elite athletes than in other team members. The difference may be explained by higher physical and psychological stress in elite athletes. It is of interest that the severity of illness among the athletes did not differ from that among the staff (table 1) . Before and during the Winter Games, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus epidemics were occurring in Finland and influenza and coronavirus epidemics were under way in South Korea. The prevailing virus epidemics obviously contributed to the transmission of the infections.",
