A natural flavonoid quercetin has a 3,5-dihydroxychromone pharmacophore which is in bioisosteric relationship with the 1,3-diketoacid moiety of the ADK. Thus, it was of our interest to test the antiviral activity of the quercetin derivatives with an arylmethyl group attached. In this study, we prepared a series of the 7-O-arylmethylquercetin derivatives with various aromatic substituents and evaluated their antiviral activity against the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV, SCV) as well as hepatitis C virus (HCV). Single difference in the aromatic substituent fine-tuned the biological activity of the 7-O-arylmethylquercetin derivatives to result in two different classes of derivatives selectively active against SCV and HCV.",

            "text": "Quercetin (1, Fig. 1 ) is widely distributed in the plant kingdom and is the most abundant of the flavonoid family. It is often a major component of the medicinal activity of the plant, and has been shown in experimental studies to have numerous effects on the body. Quercetin appears to have many beneficial effects on human health, including cardiovascular protection, anticancer activity, antiulcer effects, antiallergy activity, cataract prevention, and anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, quercetin exerts antiviral activity against reverse transcriptase of HIV (Harada et al., 1999) and other retroviruses, and was shown to reduce the infectivity and cellular replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (Amoros et al., 1992) , polio-virus type 1 (Vrijsen et al., 1988) , parainfluenza virus type 3, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Kaul et al., 1985) . Recently, we have also shown inhibition of the helicase activity of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV, SCV) by quercetin (IC 50 = 8.1 \u00b5M) (Lee et al., 2009a) . More interestingly, introduction of arylmethyl substituent such as 4-ClPhCH 2 , 3-ClPhCH 2 , and 3-CNPhCH 2 at the 7-OH position of quercetin provided the resulting quercetin derivatives (2, Fig. 1 ) with significantly increased inhibitory activity against the SCV helicase (IC 50 = 4.1, 5.2, 2.7 \u00b5M, respectively).",

As this assay is based on the luciferase activity co-expressed with the viral proteins inside the Huh-7 cell line harboring the HCV replicon, estimation of the cytotoxicity of the test compounds is an important aspect of understanding the compounds' antiviral activity. Therefore, the cell-based antiviral assay was conducted in parallel with the cytotoxicity assay. All the quercetin derivatives synthesized in this study showed moderate anti-HCV activity in the HCV replicon cell-based assay (EC 50 = 5~34 \u00b5M, Table I ). However, the 7-O-arylmethylquercetin derivatives were generally toxic against the Huh-7 cell line harboring the HCV replicon with CC 50 values of 10~20 \u00b5M (Table I) and thus, the substituent-independent anti-HCV activity seems like to be originated from the cytotoxic effect of the quercetin derivatives. Considering the well known anticancer mechanisms of quercetin (Ferry et al., 1996; Lamson and Brignall, 2000) , the cytotoxic effect of the quercetin derivatives is not surprising but some of them showed no cytotoxicity up to 100 \u00b5M (Table I) . Thus, only those five 7-O-arylmethylquercetins (2a, 2g, 2v~2x) showed selective anti-HCV activity with EC 50 values of 25.7, 11.1, 8.9, 23.5, and 33.9 \u00b5M, respectively. Interestingly, the derivatives with a strongly electron-withdrawing nitro substituent at the ortho (2g, R = 2-NO 2 ) and para (2v, R = 4-NO 2 ) position of the aromatic ring showed the most potent anti-HCV activity (11.1 and 8.9 \u00b5M, respectively) with no cytotoxicity, which suggests a possible role of the electronic property around the aromatic ring for bioactivity.",

The helicase substrate was prepared by annealing the two oligomers, which resulted in 25 base pairs of dsDNA with single-stranded 20 dT of 5'-overhang. A 80 \u00b5L solution of SCV helicase (150 nM) in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) buffer was added to each well of the 96-well assay plate which already contained 1 \u00b5L of various concentrations of chemical compounds. After 5 min incubation at rt, the FRET based dsDNA unwinding assay was started by addition of 20 \u00b5L 5X reaction solution [5 mM MgCl 2 , 45 mM ATP, 25 mM DTT, and 100 nM dsDNA substrate in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4)]. The reaction mixture was further incubated for 2 min at 37 o C and stopped with 100 \u00b5L of termination solution [0.1 M EDTA and 0.4 \u00b5M trap DNA (unmodified 25 bases 3'-0T25 oligomer) in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4)].
