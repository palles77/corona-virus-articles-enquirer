Recently, the age-related changes in several inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. The purposes of this systematic review were two-fold: (1) to describe the patterns of muscle strength loss with age in the general population, and (2) to quantify the loss of muscle strength in rheumatoid arthritis as representative for an underlying inflammatory state. Handgrip strength was used as a proxy for overall muscle strength. Results: Results from 114 studies (involving 90,520 subjects) and 71 studies (involving 10,529 subjects) were combined in a meta-analysis for the general and rheumatoid arthritis population respectively and standardized at an equal sex distribution. For the general population we showed that between the ages of 25 years and 95 years mean handgrip strength declined from 45.5 kg to 23.2 kg for males and from 27.1 kg to 12.8 kg for females. We noted a steeper handgrip strength decline after 50 years of age (rate of 0.37 kg/year). In the rheumatoid arthritis population handgrip strength was not associated with chronological age between the ages of 35 years and 65 years and was as low as 20.2 kg in male and 15.1 in female. Rheumatoid arthritis disease duration was inversely associated with handgrip strength.",

This ageing phenomenon is becoming an important public health concern as it inflicts a profound functional burden on our growing elderly population and contributes to increased morbidity (Rantanen et al., 1994; Rantanen et al., 1999; and mortality (Rantanen et al., 2000; Metter et al., 2002; Ling et al., 2010) . Several studies have shown that loss of muscle mass occurs as early as the fifth decade of life and accelerates in older age (Lexell et al., 1986; Janssen et al., 2000) . The etiology and pathogenesis of sarcopenia is complex and probably involves the interplay of a myriad of factors including physical inactivity, hormonal, metabolic and nutritional factors (Doherty, 2003; Morley et al., 2001) . Recent research has also implicated age-related changes in several inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia (Krabbe et al., 2004) .",

These meta-regression models allowed us to make tables and figures for study groups standardized at 50% females or for males and females separately. For the general population, we first ascertained by eyeballing the scatter plot a change point at which the slope of annual decrease in HGS changed most rapidly. This change point parameter was then included in the metaregression analysis as described by Samson et al. (2000) . To further extend the meta-regression models for both the general and RA population, the method of forward selection was used. We first selected the significant squared terms from the continuous independent variables and then the significant interaction terms. For the meta-regression model of the general population, this resulted in inclusion of the gender \u00d7 age interaction term in the analysis. This interaction indicated that the relation between HGS and age was dependent on the gender distribution. We plotted this relationship standardized at an equal sex distribution. For the RA population, none of the squared terms or interaction terms was significant and therefore, no further extension of the model was needed. Similarly, the method of forward selection was used in the analysis of HGS and RA disease duration, adjusted for age and gender. This resulted in inclusion of disease duration \u00d7 age interaction to the meta-regression model. Again, the meta-regression line of this model was only plotted for the case of an equal sex distribution. All statistical analyses were performed in STATA 10.

For RA, 102 study groups were extracted from 71 studies involving 10,529 subjects (Fig. 1) . In the general population, HGS was measured using a hand-held dynamometer in 99.7% of the study groups and a sphygmomanometer in 0.3%, compared to 61.7% and 38.3%, respectively of the study groups in the RA population. Standard deviation of the mean HGS was reported in 82.1% and 79.4% of the study groups for the general and RA population, respectively. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the extracted study groups for the two populations apart. The median number of subjects per study group was 50.5 in the general population and 47.0 in the RA population. The age range of subjects within all study groups in the general population was 20-100 years (median 65.0) and in the RA population 31-65 years (median 55.1). Clinical parameters (VAS and HAQ scores) and inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) were reported more frequently in the RA population compared to the general population. The RA population had higher pain score, poorer general health and elevated inflammatory markers compared to the general population. RA disease duration was reported for 86% of the RA study groups. Table 2 shows the mean HGS values according to age for the general and RA population for males and females separately. In the general population, HGS diminished gradually with age, with a change point at age 50 years after which there was a steeper decline in HGS (Table 3 and Fig. 2) . The annual decline of HGS loss was 0.06 kg from age 20 years to 50 years and 0.37 kg from 50 years onwards. In the RA population, HGS values were much lower compared to that of the general population of similar age range. In fact, they were comparable to that of the oldest old in the general population. No association was noted between chronological age and HGS in the RA population (Table 3 and Fig. 3a) . However, RA disease duration was significantly associated with a decline in HGS over time, with an annual rate of loss of 0.34 kg at age 55.6 years (95% CI: \u22120.58 to \u22120.10) (Fig. 3b) .",

However, the variance that is lost by aggregating individuals into study groups in the general population is limited, because the median SD of age for the study groups is calculated to be only 5.2 years, which is small compared to the between studies variance in mean age. In RA the median SD of age was higher (12.0 years) which could have led to an underestimation of the effect of age on HGS. Despite of aggregating, the statistical heterogeneity between study groups was high. This might be caused by differences between studies in factors such as method of HGS measurement, body composition and ethnicity and in the RA population also by RA disease duration and medication use.",

Furthermore, in the RA population, we observed an inverse association between HGS and duration of RA disease but not the influence of chronological age per se. This could in part be explained by selection as RA subjects with profound muscle weakness were less likely to participate in studies and had higher mortality due systemic disease. Still, the amount of inflammatory pressure during the ageing process is low when compared to RA (Madhok et al., 1993) . We showed that at the moment of RA diagnosis mean HGS is already as low as 20 kg. This implies that the impact of chronic inflammation on HGS was the highest already during the months from the earliest onset of RA and the moment of diagnosis, which normally goes together with the start of an antiinflammatory treatment (Morel and Combe, 2005) . For the period after diagnosis we showed RA to be associated with remarkable elevated level of inflammatory markers ESR and CRP.",

The putative link between age-related inflammation and sarcopenia mandates further exploration. Investigating RA may serve as representative condition when studying inflammatory pathways that lead to sarcopenia, which are relatively subtle in the general population. These pathways, however, represent a potential target for intervention to prevent disability and maintain functional independence in old age.",
