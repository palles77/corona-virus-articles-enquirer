Many examples have been reported. In 1976, EM of cell culture isolates identified the causative virus of an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in Zaire as a member of the family Filoviridae, now known as Zaire ebolavirus (1) (2) (3) . Reston ebolavirus was another previously unrecognized virus that was detected by cell culture and EM in 1989; it was isolated from cynomolgus monkeys imported into the United States from the Philippines (4) . In Australia in 1994, during an outbreak of fatal respiratory disease in horses and influenza-like illness in humans, a previously unknown virus, Hendra virus, was isolated in culture and recognized as a member of the family Paramyxoviridae by EM (5, 6) . An outbreak of an unidentified rash illness in humans, associated with sick prairie dogs, occurred in the upper midwestern United States in 2003, and EM detected a poxvirus from a cell culture isolate, which was later characterized as monkeypox virus (7, 8) . Recently, the etiologic agent of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome in China was isolated and identified by EM as a member of the family Bunyaviridae (9) .",

EM is also an unbiased assay in that there is no need for specific immunologic probes, and has the added advantage of being able to detect and classify the unknown agent. EM observations of cell culture isolates can provide the first clue of an etiologic agent and guide subsequent laboratory and epidemiologic investigations. Detection of a pathogen is critical during outbreaks because identification of an etiologic agent enables public health officials to mount a timely response and limit further spread of the agent involved. In addition, pathogen identification is invaluable in individual cases of severe illness in which an infection is caused by an undetermined agent. We report several cases where cell culture and EM at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) enabled initial recognition and identification of a cause of the viral illness.",

Patients had an influenza-like illness with fever, cough, dyspnea, headache, and consolidation shown on chest radiographs, and the disease became known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Isolation of a virus was achieved in several laboratories around the world by inoculating respiratory specimens onto cell culture, and thin section EM first identified the isolate as a coronavirus (12) . This finding was quickly corroborated by negative stain EM, IHC assay, serologic testing, and molecular assays. Thus, once the isolate was identified as a coronavirus by EM, the focus of the laboratory investigation shifted toward verification of this finding. The natural reservoir for the progenitor of SARS coronavirus is most likely the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) because SARS corona-like viruses were identified and characterized in these animals (13, 14) .",

Particles accumulate in cytoplasmic vesicles, which migrate toward the cell surface and fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the virus particles.

In 2 clusters of organ transplantation, 1 in 2003 and 1 in 2005, symptoms such as unexplained fever, graft dysfunction, and altered mental status developed in recipients; 7 of the 8 recipients died. An etiologic agent was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of a patient in the 2003 cluster, and identified by EM as belonging to the family Arenaviridae.

Cell culture is a fundamental procedure that can be accomplished in most hospital microbiology laboratories and should be considered if an infectious viral agent is suspected. Although some examples provided in this report were handled in biosafety level 3 handled as routine microbiological isolations in hospitals or public health departments equipped to perform routine virus isolation. Other useful laboratory methods for diagnosis of an unknown virus include serologic testing; IFA, histopathologic, and IHC assays; PCR; and sequencing. Metagenomics with deep sequencing is a recent advancement of a molecular technique that enables genomic analysis of microorganisms without the need to isolate and culture pathogens. High-throughput sequencing uses random amplified DNA products and compares the obtained product sequences with available extensive banks of sequences for final identification of the agent detected. Because random primers are used to nonspecifically amplify templates for sequencing, there is no need for prior knowledge of the suspected target. This technology is advancing rapidly and improvements in the field will undoubtedly solidify its use in the field of pathogen discovery. Previously unknown viruses that have been recognized by using this technique include Schmallenberg virus (30) , Lloviu virus (31) , and Bas-Congo virus (32) .",

B) Coronavirus particles in cytoplasmic vesicles that appear to migrate to the cell surface. Virions are seen lining the cell membrane (arrow), a characteristic feature of this virus. Scale bar = 500 nm. C) Large, pleomorphic, extracellular Nipah virus particles (arrow), in which the viral envelope encloses the nucleocapsids. Scale bar = 500 nm. D) Nipah virus nucleocapsids (arrow) aggregate in the cytoplasm and become tightly apposed to the cell membrane as the virus begins the process of budding. Scale bar = 100 nm.",
