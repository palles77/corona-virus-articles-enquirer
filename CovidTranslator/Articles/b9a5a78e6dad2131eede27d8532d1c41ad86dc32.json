At concentrations of 16-2 pg/ ml, all four avian peptides effected a greater than 90% reduction in the survival of Candida albicans, Salmonella enteriditis, and Campylobacter jejuni. None of the peptides, including the known antimicrobial peptide protamine (used as a positive control), were able to reduce the survival of Pusteurellu multocidu by 90% at the maximum peptide concentration ( 16 pg/ml) tested. At 16 pg/ml, the turkey peptide THP3 did not effect a 90% reduction in survival of Bordetella avium, Escherichia coli, or Salmonella typhimurium, while all of the other peptides tested were effective at this concentration or less. This peptide, THP3, does not share the same homologous amino acid sequence shared by the other three peptides. Under our experimental conditions, none of the peptides neutralized Infectious Bronchitis Virus, an enveloped coronavirus of chickens.",

Four avian peptides, CHP 1 and 2, and THP 1 and 3 (Evans et al., 1994) , were used for the antimicrobial assays described in this study. Peptide purity was assessed by acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by high pressure liquid chromatography (Evans et al., 1994) . Protein concentrations in 0.01% acetic acid were determined by spectrophotometric absorbance at 205 nm. The absorbance was converted to protein concentration ( pg/ml) according to a published procedure (Stoscheck, 1990 (Lockman and Curtiss, 1992) were grown on blood agar plates, transferred to 3% trypticase soy broth (TSB, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI), and incubated for 18 h at 38\u00b0C.

The two chicken peptides, CHPl and 2, differ only by 4 amino acids in the known N-terminal amino acid sequences. Of the 35 known N-terminal residues for THPI, only I2 are different from the 33 known N-terminal residues of CHP2 (Evans et al., 1994) . Despite the similarities in primary structure and spectrum of activity, these peptides varied somewhat in their relative potencies for different microorganisms, suggesting that slight differences in primary structure may influence interactions with specific target microorganisms. The fourth peptide, THP3, shares less primary structural homology with the other three and appeared less potent against the particular microbes tested. The presence of a variety of antimicrobial granulocyte peptides may be necessary for a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It is also possible that the heterophil peptides may act synergistically in killing microbes. It would be interesting to conduct studies comparing the activity of individual peptides with that of a combination of peptides. These peptides appeared least effective against P. multocidu. This finding supports the findings of a previous study which showed that heterophil lysates were not very effective against P. multocida, yet they were effective against S. aureur and E. coli (Harmon et al., 1992) . However, intact heterophils readily kill P. multocidu (Harmon et al., 1992) . The action of other heterophil components may be required to kill some bacteria.",
