KAA-2 bound exclusively to high mannose type N-glycans, but not to other glycans such as complex type, hybrid type, or the pentasaccharide core of N-glycans. This lectin exhibited a preference for an exposed a1-3 Man on a D2 arm in a similar manner to Eucheuma serra agglutinin (ESA-2), which shows various biological activities, such as anti-HIV and anti-carcinogenic activity. We tested the anti-influenza virus activity of KAA-2 against various strains including the recent pandemic H1N1-2009 influenza virus. KAA-2 inhibited infection of various influenza strains with EC 50 s of low nanomolar levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-influenza antibody demonstrated that the antiviral activity of KAA-2 was exerted by interference with virus entry into host cells. This mechanism was further confirmed by the evidence of direct binding of KAA-2 to a viral envelope protein, hemagglutinin (HA), using an ELISA assay. These results indicate that this lectin would be useful as a novel antiviral reagent for the prevention of infection.",

Suppression of virus infection by algal lectins is based on the specific interaction of lectins with target glycans on virus surfaces [2] . For example, cyanobacterial lectins such as cyanovirin-N (CV-N) from Nostoc ellipsosporum [3, 4] , scytovirin (SVN) from Scytonema varium [5] , MVL from Microcystis viridis [6] , microvirin (MVN) from Microcystis aeruginosa [7] and OAA from Oscillatoria agardhii [8] , as well as red algal lectins such as griffithsin from Griffithsia sp. [9] and ESA-2 from Eucheuma serra [10] , display strong activity with EC 50 s of pico-or nanomolar levels against HIV infection through specific recognition of HM glycans on the HIV envelope glycoprotein. These anti-HIV lectins are structurally dissimilar and their modes of carbohydrate binding are significantly different except for OAA and ESA-2, both of which have been recently classified into a new lectin family [8] . However, these anti-HIV lectins have several common characteristics, such as amino acid sequence redundancy and exclusive HM oligosaccharide recognition [1] .",

In some enveloped viruses, HM type N-glycans are predominantly present on the glycoproteins that are involved in interaction with host cells. Gp120 on the HIV surface, which mediates virus infection through direct binding to the CD4 receptor, is heavily glycosylated with HM glycans [11] . HCV expresses a high level of HM oligosaccharides on its envelope glycoproteins [12] . HM glycans are a major component of the N-glycans of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein [13] . Together with the relative abundance of HM glycans on viral surfaces, HM glycans located in close proximity to receptor-binding sites are promising and attractive targets for antiviral HM-binding lectins. In fact, HM-binding algal lectins such as CV-N show a broad range of antiviral activity against various viruses [14] [15] [16] [17] , by efficiently inhibiting the initial steps of virus entry into the cells and preventing the further establishment of infection.",

The recently emerged swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses were very rapidly transmitted from human to human and caused a global pandemic [18] . Antiviral reagents and novel therapeutic concepts are still in high demand, to control these outbreaks, because sufficient vaccine supply is not always available. Highly pathogenic virus strains such as avian H5N1 have been a global threat in recent years and mutations of these viruses, which can result in easier human-to-human transmission, has become a reality due to reassortment in host animals. In fact, pandemic H1N1-2009 and a H5N1 virus are reported to have a high genetic compatibility and reassortment between these two viruses can occur, which could create pandemic H5N1 viruses [19] . The emergence of recent pandemic swine-origin influenza virus as well as the ongoing threat of the outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses led us to explore new antiviral agents. During the course of this survey, we found that the lectin KAA-2 from the marine red alga Kappaphycus alvarezii has strong anti-influenza activity. In the present study, we have clarified and defined the oligosaccharide binding specificity of KAA-2 and evaluated its inhibitory potency against influenza virus infection.",

This lectin efficiently inhibited influenza virus infection with EC 50 s of low nanomolar levels. Furthermore, KAA-2 showed intense activity against various influenza strains, regardless of the virus subtype and strain. Intriguingly, it was reported that recent pandemic H1N1 viruses were resistant to the antiviral activities of HM-binding innate immune proteins such as surfactant protein D (SP-D) and mannosebinding lectin (MBL), but the seasonal H1N1 strains are susceptible to these proteins [21] .

Therefore, these algae are promising organisms to furnish novel biochemically active compounds such as antiviral lectins, which have potential importance for the pharmaceutical industry and public health.",

KAA-2 inhibits influenza virus propagation by directly binding to HM glycans on the envelope glycoprotein HA. The results of this paper indicate that KAA-2 would be useful as a novel antiviral agent.",

Binding activity was determined using the centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method, and is expressed as the ratio (%) of the amount of bound oligosaccharide to that of the added oligosaccharide. The structures of the oligosaccharides that are selectively recognized by KAA-2 are shown. The non-reducing terminal a1-2 Man in the D2 arm (surrounded by a dotted line in the figure) negatively participates in binding to KAA-2.

In contrast, masking of this a1-3 Man with a1-2 Man dramatically impaired lectin-carbohydrate interaction as observed for oligosaccharides Nos. 15, 17, 19, 20 and 22 (Fig. 1B). These results clearly indicate that KAA-2 specifically recognizes branched oligomannosides of HM type N-glycans and accurately distinguishes subtle differences in the branched portion of the sugar. However, KAA-2 did not interact with any branched oligomannose alone, such as Man(a1-2)Man (No. 34), Man(a1-3)Man (No. 35), Man(a1-6)Man (No. 36), Man(a1-6)[Man(a1-3)]Man (No. 37), or Man(a1-6)[Man(a1-3)]Man(a1-6)[Man(a1-3)]Man (No. 38). This result indicates that a portion of the core N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residue(s) of HM type N-glycans is also essential for interaction with KAA-2. The importance of reducing terminal GlcNAc residue(s) was most obvious when the binding activities of Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (No. 13, 95.8%) and Man5 (No. 38, 1.5%) were compared.",
