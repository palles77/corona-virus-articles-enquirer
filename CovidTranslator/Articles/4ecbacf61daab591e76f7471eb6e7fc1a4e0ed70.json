Person-to-person transmission has been described both in hospital and family settings [2] . Some examples were described by the WHO. In Japan, a tour guide was infected who was part of the same cluster of Japanese cases who had contact with tourists from Wuhan. In Germany, a case was described that was part of the cluster in Bavaria. And in Thailand, a taxi driver was confirmed as infected who had no travel history to China. In addition, in France a healthcare worker was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory disease who treated two patients later identified as probable cases [3] . It is therefore of utmost importance to prevent any further spread in the public and healthcare settings.",

One ml of sputum has been described to contain approximately 10 8 viral copies [6] . In a recent review all E-mail address: guenter.kampf@uni-greifswald.de. available data on the persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces were summarized [7] . Most data were described with the endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) strain 229E which can remain infectious for 2 h -9 d on different types of materials. A higher temperature such as 30 C or 40 C is associated with a shorter persistence of highly pathogenic Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. Few comparative data obtained with SARS-CoV indicate that persistence was longer with higher inocula. In addition it was shown at room temperature that HCoV-229E persists better at 50% relative humidity compared to 30% [8] .",

The transfer efficiency was lower with parainfluenza-virus 3 (1.5%) [10] . Although the viral load of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces is not known during an outbreak situation it seems plausible to reduce the viral load on surfaces by disinfection, especially on frequent touch surfaces in the immediate patient surrounding where the highest viral load can be expected.",

The recently published data with coronaviruses suggest that a concentration of 0.1% is effective in 1 min [7] . That is why it seems appropriate to recommend a dilution 1:50 of standard bleach in the coronavirus setting. For the disinfection of small surfaces ethanol (62%e71%; carrier tests) revealed a similar efficacy against coronavirus [7] . Ethanol at 70% ethanol is also recommended by the WHO for disinfecting small surfaces [12] .",
