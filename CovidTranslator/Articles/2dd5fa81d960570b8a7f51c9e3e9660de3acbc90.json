Considerable progress has since been made towards the construction of an effective pre-hospital care system. This article introduces the current status of the EMS in Taiwan, including the systems, response configurations, funding, personnel, medical directorship, and outcome research. The features and problems of in-hospital emergency care are also discussed. Key areas for further development in the country vary depending on regional differences in available resource and population density. An analysis of the strength, weakness, opportunity, and threats of the evolving EMS in Taiwan could be an example for other countries where the EMS is undergoing a similar process of development and optimisation.",

The main island is 394 km long and 144 km wide, slightly larger than the combined areas of Massachusetts and Connecticut, or a little smaller than the Netherlands. The population of Taiwan was estimated at almost 23 million in July 2007, spread across a land area of 35,980 km 2 , making it the 15th most densely populated country in the world. 1 In fact, the population density should be even higher than estimated because of the topographic character of Taiwan. A central mountain range geographically bisects Taiwan from north to south which results in two-thirds of the island being covered by forested peaks. Most of the population is distributed in four cities (Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Tainan), as shown in Fig. 1 . The uneven population distribution has led to disparities in regional resourcing and has influenced the level of development of the local emergency medical service (EMS) system. ",

Although some efforts were made, the situation did not alter for the better until 1990. In that year a formal emergency medical technician (EMT) training curriculum was initiated by pioneers of emergency medicine who had studied EMS abroad. This initiative was supported by the Society of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine in Taiwan. The year 1995 marked the beginning of modern EMS in Taiwan when a lot of important concepts of EMS were put into legislation, The Emergency Medical Service Act. The law designated pre-hospital care as a function of fire administration at the central and local level. It also regulated essential ambulance equipment and permitted EMTs acting as physician surrogates to provide different levels of care based on their levels of certification. In 1998, emergency medicine was recognized as an autonomous medical speciality by the Department of Health (DoH) in Taiwan. This landmark facilitated the further development of the EMS.",

The governmental services are all fire-based with three levels of care providers (EMT-I, EMT-II, EMT-P), and are activated by a universal access number (119). In some cities, hospital-based ALS teams, consisting of a physician and a nurse, participated in pre-hospital care of the critically ill but this was temporary and gradually shifted to a fire service based response soon after the introduction of qualified EMT-Ps into the system. However, due to the limited number of EMT-Ps, complete pre-hospital ALS only exists in some urban areas. The primary responsibility of the governmental EMS system is to deliver sick and injured patients to hospital and not for secondary transportation (i.e. between hospitals or back home). In contrast to the free governmental service, the private service charges patients. Most only have EMT-1 or EMT-2 crews in their ambulances and they play a complementary role to the governmental service by providing inter-hospital transport. For sicker patients, a physician or nurse from the transferring hospital is also required to staff the ambulance. As a local custom, privately supported ambulances also transport dying patients home from hospital because many people wish to pass away at home.",

There is another important resource for public EMS in Taiwan: donations from Taoism or Buddhism temples. In many jurisdictions, ambulances are funded by donations from Buddhism or Taoism temples, as indeed is most EMS equipment. This is in line with their obligation to charity.

Based on hospital accreditation in Taiwan, both doctors and nurses working in the ED are required to certify in ACLS, ATLS, or equivalent trauma training courses. Some tertiary hospitals are allowed to accept registered residency and rotating trainees including student nurses and EMTs. The major problem of EDs in Taiwan is of significant overcrowding, especially among many tertiary hospitals. Two systemic causes contribute to this condition: the limited patient flow and undeveloped interfacility transfer rules. Under the national insurance of health (NIH) for all inhabitants, the medical cost for users is relatively low in Taiwan compared to other developed countries. People can seek medical care in any level of hospital they wish, with little difference in cost. Political and cultural considerations make the attendance/triage of patients with non-serious problems to suitable EDs impossible. Solutions for overcrowding are proposed and include creation of a large holding unit, pre-established rules for admission, priority-setting and active interfacility transfer. 22 Many evidence-based life-saving strategies for severely sick patients including hypothermia for post-resuscitation care or early goal directed therapy for severe sepsis have been started in some hospitals. Although restricted financial resources and overcrowded EDs limit the practices above, there is a paradoxical phenomenon of the use of ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) in resuscitation in Taiwan. One of the most notable features of tertiary EDs is the widespread use of E-CPR (ECMOintegrated cardiopulmonary resuscitation) for cardiac arrest and its effects on outcome. 23 The intervention initially arose from a scientific interest in one medical centre, NTUH (National Taiwan University Hospital), but is now popular in many hospitals because of initial favorable outcome data, patient demands, and payments form the NIH.",

It can be divided into three models: the metropolitan, the outskirt, and the rural system, as shown in Fig. 2 . In the metropolitan model (areas marked A), both EMS personnel and hospital capacity are abundant. The goal should focus on the full implementation of more evidence-based advanced prehospital interventions and area wide disaster preparedness, and improving the precision of pre-hospital triage and transport. In the rural model (areas marked C), where pre-hospital and in-hospital EMS resources are limited, the emphasis should be placed on shortening the EMS response time and provision of good quality BLS-D care. The local public safety agencies should consider emergency healthcare services as a primary responsibility, not a role secondary to fire fighting or policing. The government should develop aero-medical capability to reduce the time to definite care for critically ill patients in these areas. Public education on awareness of severe illness and bystander CPR is also helpful. For the outskirt model (areas marked B), regionalized care for conditions such as trauma or stroke should be facilitated. EMS personnel should distribute the patient flow efficiently, including following the bypass rules, even cross-district, and streamlining the interfacility transfer network. Beyond all regional aims above, there are two important tasks that must be emphasized in all regions. First and foremost, a universal well-established infrastructure for quality assurance is of paramount importance for the EMS in Taiwan so that the quality of care and the outcomes of many new integrated interventions in the EMS can be evaluated. Another priority would be to coordinate various components in the EMS. Historical events show that coordinating services across county lines is particularly challenging. EMS personnel should also promote cooperation in solving problems arising from incidents that cross jurisdictional lines, such as near municipal and county border areas.",

The strength of the system is that the development process provides opportunities to integrate new interventions and to evaluate their outcomes. The weaknesses are an immature data collection system for quality assurance and insufficient coordination in the leadership of government healthcare between the DOH and NFA. The geographic and demographic characteristics such as frequent natural disasters, public health emergencies and an aging population provide an opportunity to create an efficient system. EMS personnel need to be able to show the benefits of their work in terms of improved patient outcomes and patient satisfaction.
