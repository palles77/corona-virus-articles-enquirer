Owing to problems such as long periods of virus shedding, existing vaccines cannot provide complete protection from PEDV infection. The PEDV genome encodes two polyprotein precursors required for genome replication and transcription. Each polyprotein undergoes extensive proteolytic processing, resulting in functional subunits. This process is mainly mediated by its genome-encoded main protease, which is an attractive target for antiviral drug design. In this study, the main protease of Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in complex with a Michael acceptor was crystallized. The complex crystals diffracted to 2.5 \u00c5 resolution and belonged to space group R3, with unit-cell parameters a = 175.3, b = 175.3, c = 58.7 \u00c5 . Two molecules were identified per asymmetric unit.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) mainly infects pigs and causes porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), a devastating enteric disease with clinical manifestations such as acute diarrhoea and dehydration (Wood, 1977) . In particular, it results in significant morbidity and mortality for neonatal piglets (Hwang et al., 1994) . PEDV was first discovered in England in 1978 (Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978; Debouck & Pensaert, 1980) . It then spread throughout Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. Currently, it is circulating in Asia, especially in those countries where the pork industry is prevalent, such as the Philippines, South Korea and China (Song & Park, 2012) . Outbreaks in these countries have been found to be more acute and severe than those observed in Europe (Song & Park, 2012) . To date, serious economic loss has been caused by PEDV. Although several vaccines have been developed against PEDV, they cannot provide complete protection from PEDV infection owing to problems such as long periods of virus shedding (Yuan et al., 1998) . Similar to other coronaviruses (CoVs), PEDV contains a single-stranded positivesense polyadenylated RNA genome that encodes two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), which need to be processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) for genome replication (Brian & Baric, 2005) . This process is mediated by two virus-encoded proteinases. Nsp5, also named the main protease (M pro ), is responsible for 11 out of 15 cleavage sites, thus playing a pivotal role in this digestion process and being indispensable for viral replication (Pyrc et al., 2004 (Pyrc et al., , 2007 Brian & Baric, 2005; van der Hoek et al., 2006) . The critical role of nsp5 in virus replication makes it an ideal target for anti-PEDV drug design Brian & Baric, 2005; Anand et al., 2003) . The crystal structures of the main proteases from Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E; Anand et al., 2003) , Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; Anand et al., 2002) , SARS-CoV (Yang et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2007) and Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; have been solved alone. Based on the structural analysis of these main proteases, the idea of designing inhibitors against CoVs has been proposed (Anand et al., 2002 2005; Yang et al., 2003; Bacha et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2007) . To date, the crystal structures of CoV main proteases from HCoV-229E (Lee et al., 2009) , TGEV (Kim et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2005) and Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Ren et al., 2013) have been solved in complex with inhibitors. In this study, we report the crystallization and preliminary crystallographic study of PEDV main protease in complex with a designed Michael acceptor inhibitor named N3 Supplementary Fig . S1 1 ). Michael acceptors are a class of conjugated ,-unsaturated carbonyl compounds that have been successfully introduced to devise irreversible covalent inhibitors of cysteine proteases from viruses such as Human enterovirus 68 (Tan et al., 2013) , rhinoviruses (Matthews et al., 1999) and coronaviruses .",

The recombinant plasmid was verified by sequencing and then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells for protein expression. Cultures were grown in LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin at 310 K until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and the cultures were induced to express PEDV main protease at 289 K for 16 h. Thereafter, centrifugation was used to harvest the cells and the bacterial pellets were resuspended in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2.7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 pH 7.3) supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 10% glycerol. After sonication at 277 K, the bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 12 000g for 50 min at 277 K and the precipitate was discarded. The supernatant was loaded onto a disposable column containing glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity resin (Pharmacia) for purification of the GST-tagged PEDV main protease. The fusion protein was then subjected to on-column cleavage using commercial PreScission protease (Pharmacia) at 277 K for 18 h. The protease was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mg ml \u00c01 for proteolysis in PBS. Five additional residues (GPLGS) were left at the N-terminus of the PEDV main protease. The resulting protein of interest was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography using a HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare) with a linear gradient from 25 to 250 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT and reached greater than 90% purity by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1a) . Typical yields were 5 mg of purified protein per litre of bacterial culture.",
