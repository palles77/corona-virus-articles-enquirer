Influenza is a disease caused by the influenza virus, an RNA virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae [3] . Many features are common with those of the paramyxovirus infections of the acute upper respiratory tract. Typical symptoms of the disease are characterized by fever, myalgia, severe malaise, non-productive cough, and sore throats. The disease spreads when an infected individual coughs or sneezes and sends the virus into the air, and other susceptible individuals inhale the virus. The virus is also believed to be transmitted when a person touches a surface that is contaminated with the virus (e.g., door knob, etc.) and then touches the nose or eyes. Infected individuals can transmit the virus almost within a day following infection (i.e. latent period). Although it is generally believed that infected individuals can pass the virus for 3-7 days following symptom onset, there is some uncertainty on the duration of the infectious period. The generation time (i.e. sum of latent and infectious periods) for influenza, reported and assumed in the literature, ranges from 3 days [4] [5] [6] to about 6 days [7, 8] .",

To appropriately assess the disaster size of a probable future pandemic, we have to quantify the transmission potential (and its associated uncertainty). Although it is difficult to directly measure the transmissibility of a future pandemic, historical epidemiologic data is readily available from previous pandemics, and as a reference quantity for future pandemic planning, mathematical and statistical analyses of the historical data can offer various insights. In particular, because many historical records tend to document only the temporal distribution of cases or deaths (i.e. epidemic curve), we modelers have faced with a difficult need to clarify the mechanisms of the spread of influenza using such time-evolution data alone. In this paper, we review a number of mathematical and statistical methods for the estimation of the transmission potential of pandemic influenza, focusing on theoretical techniques to maximize the utility of the temporal distribution of influenza cases. The methods that have been incorporated in this review include the applications of epidemiologically structured epidemic models, explicitly duration-structured epidemic system, and stochastic processes (i.e. branching and counting processes). Whereas this review does not cover the spread of influenza in space, spatial heterogeneity in transmission and the growing interest in the role of contact networks are briefly discussed as the future challenge.",

Theoretically, R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case during its entire period of infectiousness in a completely susceptible population [17] . As the epidemic progresses, the number of susceptible individuals is decreased due to infection, and the reproduction number decays following R(t) = R 0 S(t)/S(0) where S(t) and S(0) are, respectively, the number of susceptible individuals at time t and before the epidemic starts; the latter is equivalent to the total population size N given that all individuals are susceptible before the beginning of an epidemic. Clearly, this definition only applies to (novel) emerging infectious diseases (e.g., the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from [2002] [2003] or re-emerging infectious diseases that had not circulated in the population in question for long enough to allow for residual immunity in the population to disappear due to births and deaths.",

That is, when vaccine is available against a disease in question, it is of interest to estimate the critical proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated (i.e. vaccination coverage) in order to attain R < 1 [18, 19] . For example, in the U.S. prior to 1963, a vaccine against measles was not available and hence recurrent epidemics of measles were observed with approximately 3-4 million cases per year and a mean of 450 deaths. The introduction of the vaccine in the U.S. reduced the incidence by 98 percent.",

Further elaborations and reviews can be found elsewhere [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] .

Depending on the characteristics of data and underlying assumptions of the models, R 0 can be estimated using various different approaches [36] . In addition to the final size equation, R 0 of an epidemic of newly emerging disease can be estimated from the intrinsic growth rate [4, 6, 8, 18, 37, 38] , which is also referred to as the rate of natural increase, suggesting the natural growth rate of infected individuals in a fully susceptible population (discussed in Section 4). Moreover, for simple epidemic models with relatively few parameters, R 0 can be estimated with other unobservable quantities by rigorous curve fitting of model equations to the observed epidemic data (discussed in Section 3) [38] [39] [40] . Not only R 0 but also R(t) can be estimated from the temporal distribution of infectious diseases, reconstructing the transmission network or inferring the time-inhomogeneous number of secondary transmissions [41] [42] [43] [44] .",

One would need first to carry out serological surveys to quantify the fraction of the population that is effectively protected against infection (i.e. age-and/or time-specific proportion of those possessing acquired immunity needs to be estimated). Through this effort, the force of infection, the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected, is estimated [45] . For example, this is the case for rubella, mumps and measles (that are still circulating in some regions of the world even when high effective vaccination coverage is achieved). Although the estimation of R 0 for endemic diseases is out of the scope of this review, methodological details and the applications to estimate the force of infection and R 0 can be found elsewhere [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] .",

Previous studies have estimated that R 0 of the 1918/19 influenza pandemic ranged between 1.5 and 5.4 [8,38-40,57-64] depending on the specific location and pandemic wave considered, type of data, estimation method, and level of spatial aggregation, which has ranged from small towns to entire nations with several million inhabitants. Table 1 lists estimates of R 0 in recent studies. The variability of R 0 estimates suggests that local factors, including geographic and demographic conditions, could play an important role in disease spread [65] [66] [67] . In the following sections, we review how these estimates are obtained and how we shall interpret the estimates, starting from a simple structured epidemic model proposed in 1927.",

The history of the mathe-matical modeling of infectious diseases greatly remounts to the study of Sir Ronald Ross in 1911 [70] who invented a classic malaria model and also discovered the mosquito-borne transmission mechanisms of malaria. Employing a mass action principle for the spread of malaria, Ross explored the effects of controling the mosquito population using simple mathematical models [71] . Following his effort, Kermack and McKendrick introduced a classical SIR (susceptible-infectious-removed) epidemic model in 1927, which is most frequently utilized in the present day, given by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [72] :",

Although it is difficult to explicitly evaluate the difference in infectiousness between general community and hospital, we roughly made this assumption since 78 percent of the nurses of the San Francisco Hospital contracted influenza [75] . A more rigorous assumption requires either statistical analysis of more detailed time-series data [76] or an epidemiological comparison of specific groups by contact frequency [77] .

R(t) shows timedependent variation with a decline in susceptible individuals (intrinsic factors) and with the implementation of control measures (extrinsic factors).

The issue of assuming 2 In the original study of Wallinga and Lipsitch [6] , the notation R 0 is not used for Eq. (34) and rather document (34) as the estimator of R. Most likely, there are two reasons for this. First, we cannot assure if all individuals are susceptible to pandemic influenza before the start of epidemic (as discussed in Section 2). Second, we cannot assume that infection-age distribution is stable during the initial growth phase, which is highlighted in (20) . Thus, it should be remembered that the above discussion is mathematically tight in theory, but there are certain number of assumptions to apply the concept to observed data. Since writing R alone is always confusing (as it is unclear if R is concerned with time or immunity status), here we use R 0 instead. explicit distributions for latent and infectious periods has been highlighted in recent studies [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] and indeed, this point is in part addressed by (34) , because the convolution of latent and infectious periods yields w(\u03c4 ).

Even though the data represent deaths over time (i.e. not infection events with time), we can directly extract the same intrinsic growth rate as practised with onset data, assuming that death data are a good proxy for morbidity data (see our discussions in Section 6). Assuming exponential growth in deaths as shown in (29), the intrinsic growth rate r is estimated to be 0.16 per day.

For example, in Niigata Racecourse, 580 influenza cases were diagnosed with influenza among a total of 640 susceptible horses. The final size p is thus 90.6 percent (95 percent CI: 88.4, 92.9) . From this data, we calculate R 0 and its uncertainty bounds. Usingp = 0.906 and total number of infected U(T ) = 580 in Eq. (64) ,\u03b8 is estimated as 0.00408.

However, we do not know if the generation time varies between close and casual contacts; this should be the case, because, as long as the generation time is given by coevolution of latent and infectious periods, close contact should lead to shorter generation time than casual contact.

In other words, we modelers have employed similarly structured models which describe the population dynamics of other directly transmitted diseases, and such models are applicable not only for influenza but also for many viral diseases including measles, smallpox, chickenpox, rubella and so on [18] . However, influenza has many different epidemiologic characteristics compared to other childhood viral diseases. For instance, following the previous efforts in influenza epidemiology [124] [125] [126] and modeling [127, 128] , we should at least note the following: 1. Detailed mechanisms of immunity have yet to be clarified. Since influenza virus has an wide antigenic diversity (i.e. unlike other childhood viral diseases, antigenic stimulation is not monoclonal), this complicates our understanding in the fraction of immune individuals, cross-protection mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics [129] [130] [131] [132] . 2. Flu-like symptoms are too common, and thus, we cannot explicitly distinguish influenza from other common viral infections without expensive laboratory tests for each case. Because of this character, it is difficult to effectively implement usual public health measures (e.g., contact tracing and isolation). 3 . Although explicit estimates are limited [133, 134] , a certain fraction of infected individuals does not exhibit any symptoms (following infection). This complicates not only the eradication [135] but also epidemiologic evaluations of vaccines and therapeutics [136] . 4 . Looking into the details of the intrinsic dynamics [4, 123] , it appears recently that the generation time and infectious period are much shorter than what were believed previously. Therefore, despite the relatively small R 0 estimate, the turn-over of a transmission cycle (i.e. speed of growth) is rather quick. The incubation period of Spanish influenza is as short as 1.5 days [137] , complicating the implementation of quarantine measures [138] .",

A similar application of the convolution equation has been intensively studied in modeling HIV/AIDS. Since AIDS has a long incubation period, and because AIDS diagnosis is certainly reported in the surveillance data (at least, in industrialized countries), backcalculation of the number of HIV infections with time using the number of AIDS diagnoses and the incubation period distribution has been an issue to capture the whole epidemiologic picture of HIV/AIDS [139] [140] [141] [142] . In the current modeling practice using the temporal distribution of onset events, we are now faced with a need to apply this technique to diseases with much shorter incubation periods. Now, let us look back at a method to estimate R(t), which was proposed by Wallinga and Teunis [41] . Whereas the method has a background of mathematical reasoning (as shown in (46), Section 4.2), the estimator was derived implicitly assuming that observed data exactly reflects infection events. If asymptomatic infection and transmission are rare, this assumption might be justifiable as the lengths of the serial interval and generation time become almost identical. However, as long as we cannot ignore asymptomatic transmissions, which is particularly the case for influenza, the assumption s(\u03c3 ) = w(\u03c4 ) might be problematic [85] .",

For example, in a pioneering study of gonorrhea transmission dynamics by Hethcote and Yorke [147] , an importance of contact heterogeneity was sufficiently highlighted. Since a simple model assuming homogeneous mixing did not reflect the patterns of gonorrhea transmission in the United States, Hethcote and Yorke divided the population in question into two; those who are sexually very active and not, the former of which was referred to as core group. Compared with the temporal distribution of infection given by a model with homogeneous mixing assumption, the simple heterogeneous model with a core group revealed much quicker increase in epidemic size, showing rather different trajectory of an epidemic. Given that the variance of sexual partnership is extremely large (i.e. if the distribution of the frequency of sexual intercourse is extremely skewed to the right with a very long right tail), the estimate of R 0 is shown to become considerably high. The finding supports a vulnerability of our society to the invasion of sexually transmitted diseases. Following this pioneering study, considerable efforts have been made to approximately model the heterogeneous patterns of transmission using extended mean field equations [18, 26, 148, 149] .",

The importance of the network structure would also be highlighted for v > 3. For sexually transmitted infections, contact frequency is countable (unlike airborne infection or transmission through droplets), and v is estimated to be around 3 or a little larger [157] . Following such a finding, many non-sexual directly transmitted diseases are also modeled in the present day assuming the scale-free network [150] . However, it should be noted that the pattern of contact does not necessarily follow scale-free for all directly transmitted diseases. Indeed, there is no empirical evidence which suggests that the contact structure of any droplet infections follows the power law (i.e. we do not know if the above described contact heterogeneity is the case for diseases except for sexually transmitted diseases). A typical example of confusion is seen in the superspreading events during the 2002/03 SARS epidemics [158] , where we cannot explicitly attribute the phenomena either to contact network or biological factors (as long as contact and infection event are not directly observable). We still do not know how we should account for the distribution P (k) for influenza and other viral respiratory diseases (i.e. power law or not) which remains to be clarified for each disease in future research.",

As we have shown, temporal case distributions have been analyzed in many instances, and previous efforts have come close to maximize the utility of temporal distributions (i.e. epidemic curve). However, at the same time, we have also learned that we can extract almost the intrinsic growth rate alone from a single timeevolution data. Accordingly, we are now faced with a need to clarify heterogeneous patterns of transmission and more detailed intrinsic dynamics of influenza [166] [167] [168] . With regard to the latter, primitive epidemiologic questions (e.g., probability of clinical attack given infection) remain to be answered for Spanish, Asian and Hong Kong influenza. Let us summarize what we need to clarify theoretically about pandemic influenza in list:",

For example, the majority of the above listed issues could be reasonably addressed by implementing serological surveys (e.g., antibody titers of individuals and, preferably, time-delay distribution from infection to seroconversion). Since the proportion of those who do not experience symptomatic infection (i.e. probability of asymptomatic infection) is not small for influenza [64, 146] , case records can tell us little to address the above mentioned issues, and thus, historical data of Spanish influenza may hardly offer further information. By maximizing the utility of observed data, we have to clarify the dynamics of influenza further, and identify key information which characterize the specific mechanisms of spread.",
