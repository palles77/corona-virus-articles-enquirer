The cellular A 570 values, the highest virus inhibitory rates and the score based on virus inhibitory rate were calculated to compare their antiviral activity. In immune protective test, the effects of three preparations (EF-BSRF, EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF and EF-WDFF-BSRF screened by the results in vitro experiment) on NDV infection were compared in chickens vaccinated with ND vaccine then challenged with NDV. Blood was regularly sampled for serum antibody titer determination. The pathogenic and dead statuses of chickens were clinically examined. The results indicated that the A 570 values of the nine prescriptions, especially the foresaid three prescriptions at almost all concentrations in three drug-adding modes were significantly higher than that of the virus control group. The foresaid three prescriptions presented at the top five of the highest virus inhibitory rate, and located at the highest three of the score rank. The antibody titers and protective rates of the three prescriptions groups were higher than that of VC group, especially EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF group showed significant difference. These results indicated that flavone prescriptions composed with suitable compatibility could possess synergistical action of antiviral effect, ES-SF-WDFF-BSRF prescription could inhibit the cellular infectivity of NDV, improve the protective effect of ND vaccine and would be expected to exploit into a new-type antiviral drug.",

Because virus has unique biological characteristics and pathogenesis, there are no effective treatment methods for viral diseases [2] . The virus disease has become one of the most serious threatens to human or animal health. Vaccination is the most common preventive method, but some infectious diseases are still difficult to control because the efficacies of some vaccines are severely decreased when a virus circulation does not have a good match with vaccine strains due to antigenic drift or inaccurate epidemiological predictions [3] , or some vaccines with inferior quality, improper conservation and transportation problems [4] . A few chemical drugs have been used, but their clinical effects are not satisfied and there are obvious negative effects such as drug residues, drug tolerance, high recurrence rate, environmental pollution and so on [5] . Therefore, it becomes so urgent to study and develop new-type antiviral drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity, which will be an important topic to many scholars [6] .",

On one hand, CHMs possess many biological activities, such as adjusting immunologic function, inhibiting viral processes (adsorption, transcription, replication and release) and so on, which showed reliable biological functions with little side effects and low toxicity. On the other hand, many researches demonstrated that CHMs possess many antiviral active materials. And many active materials had not been discovered yet [9] . Moreover, new virus or strains of virus emerge continually. So, antiviral compound screened from CHMs became a hotspot for many investigators.",

Though some Chinese veterinary herbal medical preparations, such as injection of honeysuckle flower-baical skullcap root-forsythia suspense, and injection of astragalus polysaccharides have become one of principal weapons in veterinary clinical therapy and play an important role in clinical epidemic prevention.

In the present experiment, the A 570 values of the nine prescriptions at all concentrations in post-and simultaneousadding modes, and of most of the prescriptions at proper dose in pre-adding mode were significantly higher than those of the corresponding virus control group. The results suggested that these prescriptions could effectively inhibit NDV from infecting in vitro, and the sterilization and treatment effects were better than the preventative effect. The virus inhibitory rate directly reflects the antiviral intensity of drug [14] . The scores and rank of antiviral activity is of benefit to compare antiviral activity. In three drug-adding modes, the prescriptions of EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF, EF-BSRF and EF-WDFF-BSRF presented at the top five of the highest virus inhibitory rate. Furthermore, their total scores located the highest three of the score rank. Moreover, the A 570 values of prescriptions of EF-SF-WDFF-BSRF (pre-, post-, simultaneous-adding), EF-BSRF (pre-, simultaneous-adding) and EF-WDFF-BSRF (post-, simultaneousadding) were not only significantly larger than those of the corresponding virus control group (p < 0.05), but also significantly larger than those of the corresponding cell control group (p < 0.05).

If the antibody titer is higher, the infection degree of chicken to NDV will be less serious [22] . The results of immune protection test showed that on days 14, 21 and 28 after the first vaccination and day 12 after challenge (D 40 ), the antibody titers in three flavone prescriptions groups, especially in ES-SF-WDFF-BSRF group were significantly higher than those in VC group and BC group. This confirmed that the three flavone prescriptions could accelerate the antibody production in vaccinated and challenged chickens, the efficacy of ES-SF-WDFF-BSRF was stronger than those of the other two prescriptions. The results were consistent with that of antiviral effect of prescriptions in vitro, which confirmed that three flavone prescriptions, especially ES-SF-WDFF-BSRF had the best efficacy in enhancing humoral immunity thus improving the immune effect of ND vaccine.",
