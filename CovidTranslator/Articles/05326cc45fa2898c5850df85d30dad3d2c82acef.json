Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 have caused pandemics in humans, and subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 circulate in humans as seasonal influenza. Pandemic influenza arises when an animal influenza virus evolves through the reassortment of animal and human virus gene segments (antigenic shift) to sustainably transmit in humans. Avian and swine influenza viruses have caused zoonotic infections, some resulting in fatal disease. Thus, influenza virus surveillance in animals is needed for pandemic preparedness (1) .",

The dromedary influenza A virus isolated in Nigeria in January 2016 was similar to other influenza viruses circulating in humans at the same time. The sampling dates for the influenza viruses detected in camels in Nigeria overlapped with the human influenza virus season, which typically occurs during October-March (Appendix Table) (7). This finding suggests reverse zoonosis of influenza viruses from humans to dromedaries. Whether these viruses were subsequently maintained in dromedary populations via camel-to-camel transmission is not clear. Further studies are needed to address this question. Transmission of influenza A virus also occurs from humans to swine, and these viruses can be maintained in swine populations for variable periods, sometimes decades (8) .",

The dromedaries that had influenza A virus RNA-positive nasal swabs were negative for HI antibody. Dromedaries recently infected with a virus are expected to be seronegative for that virus because antibody responses against viruses take around a week to develop (9), by which time nasal swab specimens are often negative for that virus's genomic material. Microneutralization tests are more appropriate for testing antibody to contemporary H3N2 viruses (10) ; hence, we also tested serum samples for antibody to A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2) virus using the microneutralization test (Appendix).

Tree was constructed by using a general time-reversible model with FastTree (https://www.geneious.com/ plugins/fasttree-plugin) and PhyML (http:// www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml) (Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/26/01/19-1165-App1.pdf). Tree is rooted with an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus collected in 2009. Bootstrap support values for the major branches are shown. Scale bar indicates number of nucleotide changes per base pair.",

Histopathologic findings also confirmed viral infection in 2 BKV cases. Our data show BKV is a potential causative agent for diarrhea in calves. (1). Since then, BKV has been reported in Thailand, Hungary, the Netherlands, Korea, Italy, Brazil, China, and Egypt (2-9). However, circulation of BKV in North America remains unclear. We report detection of BKV in calves in the United States.",

Results of tests for rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidium, and Escherichia coli were positive; results for Salmonella were negative.We extracted nucleic acid from the fecal sample and conducted a sequence-independent single-primer amplification and library preparation by using Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, https://www.illumina.com). We conducted sequencing on a MiSeq (Illumina) using MiSeq Reagent Kit V2 (Illumina) at 500 cycles, as previously described (10) . We conducted a taxonomic analysis of raw FASTQ files using Kraken version 1 and MiniKraken DB (https://ccb. jhu.edu/software/kraken), which showed 15,582 kobuvirus sequence reads in addition to sequences for E. coli, coronavirus, and rotavirus. We assembled the complete genome of BKV IL35164 (GenBank accession no. MN336260) with a genome size of 8,337 nt. We used BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Blast.cgi) to search the IL35164 genome and found it is closely related to and shares 89%-91% identities with 4 BKV strains, U-1, EGY-1, SC1, and CHZ. It shares only 77%-82% identity with sheep and ferret kobuviruses.",
