Destinations are also one of the key building blocks for developing both domestic and international tourism through their function of providing a focus for visitors and investment in tourism-related activities. Over time, and as growth occurs, some destinations will also become generators of visitors. This chapter examines a range of transport issues involved in destination development and demonstrates how the transport system can stimulate tourism by analysing the emergence of Cairns (Queensland, Australia) as an international destination. The chapter draws together previous research in this area to build a theoretical basis of future study of the role of transport in destination development. Given the significant impact that new transport technologies have had on the shape, structure and economics of travel and tourism since Thomas Cook's addition of rail as the third passenger mode (road and sea being the first and second respectively), and the significance of that journey as the start of the contemporary tourism era 1 (Prideaux 2002a) , an understanding of the central position that transport occupies in the tourism industry is important if the future evolution of destinations is to be comprehensively understood.",

            "text": "This chapter looks at the impact of transport on destination development but the term destination is not clearly defined in the literature either in a spatial sense, functional sense, political sense, or economic sense. Often, the literature uses the terms destination and resorts interchangeably. Thus, a seaside tourist city such as Brighton in the U.K. is referred to as a resort in the literature emanating from the U.K. but a similar size seaside tourist city in Australia and parts of Asia is often referred to as a destination. Given this lack of definitional clarity this chapter combines two views of destinations. The broad view refers to any definable spatial area where tourism is an established industry and draws visitors from regions or countries outside that destination. A destination in this sense can be as small as a seaside village or mountain vacation town or, as large as a region, state or nation. The second view of destinations is much narrower and combines the European concept of resort used to describe a specific urban area specialising in tourism, with the term destination when used to describe a similar area, to create the term resort destination. Used in this sense, the term resort destination describes a specific urban locality that specialises in tourism and is defined by the functions that are provided including: a designated area set aside for human leisure consumption; provision of leisure services for short term visitors; contain a range of touristic attractions; and provide commercial accommodation. Irrespective of size, the destination's visitors must travel from their home, in an origin or generating region, to the destination via some form of transport.",

On the vertical axis destinations are identified according to their political boundaries. In many areas of the world political boundaries transect spatial areas that exhibit the features of a tourism destination (Timothy 1995 (Timothy , 2001 .

The journey from a point of origin to a destination has become routine and if complaints are made it is often about the comfort of seats or the service quality offered by transport operators. But travel was not always safe, fast, comfortable or inexpensive and history has left us many accounts of the adventures and hardships that early travellers had to endure as they explored the world in the pre-contemporary era (Prideaux 2002a) . Historical records give us some understanding of the role played by transport in the past. Herodotus, history's first recorded travel writer, has left us with many fascinating insights into life and travel in the Mediterranean and Middle East in the fifth century BC (Casson 1974) . In the third century BC, a list of the Seven Wonders of the World (Casson 1974) was compiled by an unknown scholar for the travellers of that era. Most of these sites were old even in the third century BC and constituted the icons of the contemporary traveller of that era. In the Christian Bible a harrowing account of sea travel in the Mediterranean was recorded by the Apostle Paul (1984 edn) (Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 27). Prideaux (2000a) provides a detailed account of the development of transport and its impact on the development of tourism from Herodotus to the present and emphasises the significance of the transport system and its technology as a facilitator of travel in the past, in the present and also into the future.",

However, the relationship between tourism and transport, and more specifically the relationship between transport and destination growth, has been largely ignored. This is surprising, however, as Prideaux (2000b) observed that the operation of the transport system is often taken as a given and the impact that transport can exert over the shape and welfare of the tourism industry is often ignored. History illustrates the role of transport in destination development. The massive expansion of seaside resorts in nineteenth century Britain was made possible by the building of rail networks that offered fast and comfortable travel arrangements (Gilbert 1939 : Kaiser & Helber 1978 . In a similar manner, the enhanced mobility offered by the automobile and aeroplane underpinned the development of both domestic and international tourism in the twentieth century. Chew (1987) described the impact of railway, cars and planes as the three transport revolutions that shaped tourism.",

From an origin perspective, distance and the type of transport services that connect the origin to the destination are important factors and can be described by application of the concept of peripherality. From a destination perspective, the distance that separates it from the various origin markets that it draws visitors from will have a significant impact on the structure of the destination's infrastructure and the classification of visitor segments that it services. From another perspective the mass tourism phenomenon of the twentieth century, and the sand and sun destinations that characterise mass tourism, was underpinned by a juxtaposition of new transport technology and Fordist patterns of production and consumption. In the future emerging forms of tourism (Torres 2002) such as neo-Fordist tourism described as niche market mass tourism and post-Fordist tourism described as specialised/individualised niche mass tourism will become more popular and require new responses by the transport sector.",

Essentially, a periphery is a spatial concept that measures the location of a point of interest in a remote location by the distance, or perception of distance, that separates it from the core. In tourism, the core is taken to be a tourism generating region and the further the periphery is from the core the more difficult it is to encourage flows of visitors from the core to the periphery. Periphery can be determined by a number of factors including accessibility, distance, visitor perceptions and scale. Researchers, including Oppermann (1993) , Pearce (1995) and Weaver (1998) , have developed a range of interpretations of the concept including an international core-periphery dynamic, an internal core-internal periphery dynamic (Weaver 1998) , \"plantation tourism model\" (Weaver 1988 ) and the distinction between formal and informal tourism space (Oppermann 1993) .",

Before the introduction of commercial jet passenger services, countries in Asia and the Caribbean lay in Europe's periphery. This is no longer the case for many Asian and Caribbean destinations where suitable transport infrastructure has been established to minimise the time and cost of travel from the origin region to the destination region. Where adequate transport infrastructure has not been established the constraints of periphery remain. Thus, while Beijing is directly accessible from many European capital cities, Tibet, over which many China-Europe flights pass, remains a difficult and expensive locality to travel to. Factors that determine the scale or degree of the periphery from the core include actual distance, perceived distance and the cost of travel.

Travellers to H have no options of this nature and because of the structure of the transport system servicing the destination, incur the higher transport cost T 2 which is greater than the maximum holiday budget CC 1 . Although G and F are physically more distant they are cheaper to travel to. Tourists travelling to destination G have the option of selecting the least expensive transport option and reallocating the savings to other classes of expenditure. Travel to destination F is affordable if mode T 1 is used but not if mode T is used. Because of the high cost of travel, destination H is unlikely to attract visitors unless they can increase their maximum travel budget. This example illustrates the significance of transport in travel decision making. Thus, while H is physically closer to the origin point, it occupies a peripheral position because of the high access cost compared to more distant, but cheaper to access, destinations G and F. This paradox is explained by viewing peripheries as more than distance-based and as suggested by Prideaux (2002b: 381) , the concept of periphery should include a range of factors including \"distance, accessibility, visitor perceptions, and scale which can be measured from slightly peripheral to very peripheral, or exhibit location characteristics which describe the periphery as near or far.\" In addition to these factors, the concept of origin push and destination pull should also be considered. Thus, while a destination may be physically closer to the origin, a destination may be perceptually more peripheral because of the cost or difficulty of access. The location of a destination in either a near or far periphery will effect investment decisions, marketing strategies, public subsidies and management strategies. There is also a relationship between the major attractions of a destination and the degree of its remoteness. As the degree of remoteness increases the scale and uniqueness of its attractions must be enhanced if the destination is to attract visitors who might otherwise confine their travel to less remote sites.",

            "text": "A further explanation for the paradox of H's peripheral status relative to the location of origins and other destinations can be found in the concept of push and pull (Dann 1977; Laws 1995) . Push factors refer to the combination of factors that encourage travel beyond the locality where potential tourists live and work. As personal income increases, and this can be measured on a national scale by GDP, there is an increased propensity to travel although other factors including personal and national security, length of annual holidays, and attitudes to travel may be constraints. In destinations, a range of pull factors encourage visitors to select one specific destination over its competitors. Pull factors include the uniqueness of a destination's attractions, its cost structure, security, image and ease of access. In the case of destination H, if its attractions were considered to be unique or even iconic in nature, tourists may be encouraged to increase the size of their travel budgets beyond CC 1 to fund travel. This could be achieved in a number of ways including sacrificing other non travel expenditure, or by changing their holiday cycle from one trip per year to a trip cycle of one trip every two years. Either of these strategies enables H to become affordable and the magnitude of its pull factors become sufficiently large, at least for some tourists, to outweigh the negative impact of its peripheral status.",

The Resort Development Spectrum (RDS) developed by Prideaux (2000d) is a multi dimensional model that takes into account the impact of location of the resort destination relative to its major origin markets by measuring the relationship between the expansion of destination infrastructure, the local economy and the emergence of market segments. The RDS identifies the role of economic forces, origin markets and infrastructure on growth and agues that the resort destination's micro-economy influences the investment decisions made by suppliers, and through these decisions, the path and format that growth will take over time. Commencing with visitors from nearby areas, the RDS traces the impact of expansion into new market sectors (see Figure 6 .3) on the resort destination's infrastructure including transport, hotels and commercial facilities (see Figure 6 .4). The markets that a resort destination may target include regional, national and international. Prideaux (2000d) observed that the capacity of resorts is essentially a locality specific factor and is determined by the juxtaposition of a number of elements including the availability of land, specific environment factors, the aspirations of the host community, perceptual (psychological) components, sustainability, public sector responses, infrastructure, provision of support services and transport access'. The rate of growth of resort destinations varies and depends on the ability of the resort destination to satisfy twelve key criteria, including investment in new transport infrastructure, and the distance of the resort destination from its major origin regions. In effect these criteria constitute a checklist, which if satisfied will facilitate growth or if violated will hamper growth. Other factors (Prideaux 2000b: 323 ) that affect the rate of growth are:",

It is apparent that the opening of the Cairns International airport reduced the image of Cairns as a peripheral Australian destination and stimulated rapid growth in international tourist arrivals. Cairns, located in the far north of Queensland, was established as a port to service the region's mining, agricultural and pastoral industries. The scenic beauty of the town, located in the wet tropics rainforest zone, was recognised in the first part of the twentieth century but its relative isolation from the remainder of Australia and the need to travel by coastal steamer deterred many visitors. The opening of a rail link to the remainder of Australia in 1924 reduced this sense of isolation, however, Cairns still occupied a peripheral location relative to Australia's other major regional tourism regions. The completion of an all weather road to Brisbane, the state capital, did not occur until after the Second World War. However, when constructed the highway eased Cairns isolation and encouraged a boom in intrastate drive tourism. Increased car ownership levels, the long period of post-war prosperity, granting of four weeks paid annual leave and the popularity of caravanning made the five day 2,720 kilometre return trip between Cairns and Brisbane possible.",

Travel times still remained a deterrent for interstate visitors and until the introduction of jet passenger aircraft following the opening of a jet standard runway in 1965, the number of visitors from the larger southern metropolitan cities of Sydney and Melbourne were limited. Introduction of jet services ended the sense of periphery that the Cairns tourism industry had previously experienced in interstate markets and by 1982/83 interstate tourist accounted for 41.8% of all visitors. Reducing the sense of periphery also paralleled the growing strength of a range of pull factors such as new tourism products, additional hotels, golf courses and shopping facilities. The significance of air travel vs. other forms of travel can be seen in the distribution of tourists by transport mode. In 1995/96, 11.8% of intrastate visitors travelled to Cairns by air compared to 73.4% who travelled by road. In the same year, 21% of interstate visitors travelled to Cairns by road compared to 61.8% who travelled by air. In some origin markets, Sydney for example, 88.3% of visitors travelled by air (Bureau of Tourism Research 1998).",

This action increased the time and cost of travel from Asia to Cairns thus casting it as a more peripheral destination than other competitors such as Hawaii. As a consequence, the annual growth in international passenger arrivals and departures between 1995/96 and 2000/01 averaged 0.9% compared to 2.8% average annual growth for domestic passengers over the same period (Cairns Port Authority 2002) . During this period a number of international airlines including MAS, Singapore Airlines and Garuda Indonesia ceased operating services to Cairns. One consequence of the reduction in direct flights was a fall in the percentage of international visitors to 38.6% of all visitors in 2000, although in numerical terms the number had increased from 606,000 in 1996 to 777,000 in 2000, including international visitors who arrived via domestic air services. Figure 6 .5 illustrates the rapid growth in international visitors following the opening of the international airport. Investment in facilities such as retail shopping malls, golf courses, new visitor attractions, additional land and marine tours, holiday apartments and holiday hotels to support the international market also appears to have had a spill-over effect into the domestic intrastate and interstate markets attracting additional visitors because of the expanded volume and quality of tourism products.",

New transport technologies can be expected to continue this trend in future but for a destination to take advantage of existing and proposed technologies, it must have available to it an appropriate transport infrastructure.",

Of course the availability of transport is not a panacea for tourism development as a destination must also have other tourist related infrastructure as well as a range of attractions that will generate interest by potential travellers. Transport's role is therefore one that lies in the background, noticed only when it is inadequate to the task or falls short of the expectations of the traveller and the destination.",

Just as there are examples of transport and its supporting infrastructure stimulating tourism development there are other examples of where the provision of these facilities has not provided the desired stimulus. For example, Biak, located in the Pacific Ocean north of Irian Jaira was identified as a site for the development of a major integrated tourism development along the lines of the Nusa Dua model (Prideaux 2000e ) and a major hotel and international standard airport were constructed. The failure of Indonesia's Garuda Airline to operate direct international flights to Biak because of the inability of the project to attract customers resulted in low occupancy rates and the failure of the area to gain other tourism investment (BTE 1999) .",

            "text": "In the opening paragraph to this chapter it was stated that an understanding of the central position of transport in destination development is essential if the destination growth process is to be comprehensively understood. In the following discussion many of the key relationships between transport and destination development were discussed. In the future there is an urgent need to pursue further research into the relationship between transport and destination development. This research might include: ongoing analysis into the impact of new technologies; developing more efficient transport networks to service destinations; negative impacts such as pollution, civil and military conflict and the ease with which efficient transport systems can spread disease as recently demonstrated by the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic that traveled from China via Hong Kong to many countries via air travelers (Lemonick 2003) ; and from a more philosophical perspective the role of transport in emerging Post-Fordist, Neo-Fordist and Post Modernist patterns of tourism demand. Note 1. Prideaux (2002b) proposed a new tourism metaphor, the Tourism Evolution Model, to describe the development of tourism from the past, to the present and into the future. The Tourism Evolution Model identifies three eras: Contemporary to describe the present era and commencing with the first organised rail tour in 1841, Pre-contemporary to describe the past and Post-contemporary to describe the future where current production systems will be replaced by new and as yet unknown production systems. Existing production systems described by the Modernist and Fordist models and their derivatives are encompassed within the Contemporary era.",
