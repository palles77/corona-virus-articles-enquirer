However, the costly commercial Ulp1 and its complicated procedures limit its application in the preparation of the target protein with natural N-terminal sequence. Here, we describe the preparation of bioactive codon-optimized recombinant truncated Ulp1 (Leu403-Lys621) (rtUlp1) of S. cerevisiae in Escherichia coli using only one-step with Ni-NTA affinity chromatograph, and the application of rtUlp1 to cleave the SUMO fusion protein by simply mixing the purified rtUlp1, SUMO fusion protein and DL-Dithiothreitol in Tris-HCl buffer. The optimal expression level of nonfusion protein rtUlp1 accounts for approximately 50 % of the total cellular protein and 36 % of the soluble form by addition of isopropyl b-D-l-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mM at 18\u00b0C for 20 h. The purification of target protein rtUlp1 was conducted by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The final yield of rtUlp1 was 45 mg/l in flask fermentation with a purity up to 95 %. Furthermore, the high purity of rtUlp1 could effectively cleave the SUMO-tTbRII fusion protein (SUMO gene fused to truncated transforming growth factor-beta receptor type II gene) with the above simplified approach, and the specific activity of the rtUlp1 reached up to 2.8 9 10 4 U/mg, which is comparable to the commercial Ulp1. The preparation and application strategy of the rtUlp1 with commonly available laboratory resources in this study will be convenient to the cleavage of the SUMO fusion protein to obtain the natural N-terminal target protein, which can be implemented in difficult-to-express protein functional analysis.",

Several preclinical and clinical studies provided evidences that SUMOylation modification of the target proteins played a critical role in tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and metastasis [4] [5] [6] . Recent studies concerning the preparation of difficult-to-express proteins suggest that the SUMO was used as a fusion partner to express the SUMO fusion protein, and SUMO protease was used as a specific enzyme to obtain the target protein by cleavage of the SUMO fusion protein [7] [8] [9] . The advantage of the SUMO fusion protein is to facilitate correct protein folding and improve protein solubility via the SUMO moiety; thus making it an ideal tag to prepare difficult-to-express proteins [1, 10, 11] . With the exception of improving protein folding and solubility, the other advantage is to protect the target proteins from proteolytic degradation [12, 13] . In addition, the most intriguing feature of this technique is applying the SUMO protease to cleave lots of SUMO fusion proteins [14] . Yeast SUMO proteases, ubiquitin-like protease 1 (Ulp1) and ubiquitin-like protease 2 (Ulp2), cleave the C-termini of SUMO (-GGATY) to the mature form (-GG) and deconjugate it from modified proteins. A few of traditional proteases, such as tobacco etch virus protease (TEV) [15] , factor Xa [16] , or thrombin protease [17, 18] , are applied to cleave the fusion proteins between different fusion tags and the target proteins. However, these traditional proteases recognize the short and degenerate sequences, resulting in the retention of several amino acids downstream from the cleavage site, which are indispensable for protease recognition. This is disadvantageous as a number of proteins with natural N-terminus will not be successfully prepared by the technique of gene fusions with traditional proteases, thereby compromising biological activity and/or structural stability [19] [20] [21] . However, the Ulp1 is remarkably robust and highly specific in recognizing the tertiary structure of SUMO and is able to cleave between the SUMO tag and the target protein with no erroneously, and finally produce the target protein with natural N-terminal sequence [1, 11, 22] . These observations suggest that the application of Ulp1 protein to cleave the SUMO fusion protein is effective to obtain the target protein with natural N-terminal sequence by the SUMO fusion expression system. Thus, it is an ideal tool to prepare the target protein. As previously reported, several difficult-to-express proteins, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CL protease, nucleocapsid, membrane proteins and matrix metalloprotease 3, have been successfully prepared with the help of Ulp1 in the SUMO fusion expression system [23, 24] .",

Thus, we want to know whether the application of Ulp1 without desalting and dialyzing could effectively cleave the SUMO fusion protein. Based on these previous studies [1, 26] and the effects of the imidazole and NaCl on the cleavage of the SUMO fusion protein, a simplified approach described here, which is the reaction mixture containing the purified digestion enzyme rtUlp1 without desalting and dialyzing, SUMO fusion protein substrates without desalting and dialyzing, and DTT were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1 h in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (Fig. 6b) , will be effective. To verify the simplified approach is effective, the cleavage of SUMO-tTbRII fusion protein was determined by this approach. As shown in Fig. 7 , the rtUlp1 at the final concentration of 10, 15, 20 and 25 lg/ml could also cleave most of the SUMO-tTbRII fusion protein, as demonstrated by the appearance of two new bands corresponding to the SUMO (*18 kDa) and tTbRII (*4 kDa), and disappearance of most SUMO-tTbRII proteins; whereas the rtUlp1 at the final concentration of 5 lg/ml could cleave a little of the fusion protein. Meanwhile, the SUMO-tTbRII fusion protein is cleaved up to 95 % by the rtUlp1 at the final concentration of 10 lg/ml at 30\u00b0C for 1 h, and this result showed that the activity of the purified rtUlp1 is 5.6 U/ll and the specific activity is 2.8 9 10 4 U/mg.

            "text": "The SUMO protein, which is present in eukaryotes and absent in prokaryotes [29] , is highly stable and resistant to heat and proteolysis [30] . The attachment of a highly stable SUMO structure at the N-terminus of a target protein increases protein solubility by its chaperoning properties. Thus, SUMO is an extremely useful tag for heterologous expression to obtain desired target proteins. The advantages of SUMO as a fusion tag included the manner in which is the Ulp1 cleaves precisely the final glycine residue of the tertiary structure of SUMO [10, 31] in a broad range of temperatures (4-37\u00b0C) and pH (5.5-9.5) [11] , and the Ulp1 is remarkably robust in the cleavage of SUMO fusion proteins regardless of the target proteins [32] . Meanwhile, it is necessary to desalt and dialyze in the application of Ulp1 to the cleavage of SUMO fusion proteins according to manufacturer's instruction of commercial Ulp1 (LifeSensors, Malvern PA, USA). However, the costly commercial Ulp1 and its complicated procedures limit its application in the preparation of the target protein.",

The artificial DNA sequence of Ulp1 (digested by NdeI and BamHI) was ligated into pET28a and expressed in the supernatant of lysed bacteria after sonication by addition of 0.4 mM IPTG at 18\u00b0C for 20 h. Our results showed that the rtUlp1 is high level expression in the form of soluble protein as an unfused protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3). In the process of purification of rtUlp1, the rtUlp1 with 6 9 His tags was eluted with elution buffer containing different concentration of imidazole. Meanwhile, in the next step to prepare the native target protein, the rtUlp1 with 6 9 His tags could be removed from the cleavage reaction mixture through Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Our results also showed that the recombinant protein could be purified in a single chromatographic step, and 45 mg/l in flask fermentation with a purity up to 95 %. Western blot analysis showed that the purified rtUlp1 specifically interacted with anti-6 9 His tags antibody. All of these results showed that high soluble expression and purity of the rtUlp1 was obtained by our cost-effective system. The experiment procedure described previously [26] is an arduous task because it mainly involves three steps: (1) desalting with Sephardex G-25; (2) dialyzing with Tris-HCl (20 mM, pH 8.0); and (3) cleavage of the SUMO fusion proteins with Ulp1 and DTT. Some studies showed that the Ulp1 can effectively cleave the SUMO fusion proteins in the presence of 2 M urea and 100 mM Gu-HCl [1] ; thus, we want to know whether the digestion enzyme Ulp1 could directly cleave the SUMO fusion proteins in presence of different concentration of imidazole and NaCl when DTT (2 mM) was added. The results showed that the SUMO-tTbRII could not be cleaved only in the presence of 2 mM DTT (data not shown). However, the reaction was successfully completed when DTT (2 mM) and Tris-HCl (20 mM) were supplement. We speculated that, most likely, adding Tris-HCl (20 mM) buffer into the reaction mixture dilute the concentration of imidazole and NaCl, thereby, performing the cleavage of the SUMO fusion protein.",

In the study, we carried out the cleavage of the SUMO fusion protein at the final concentration of imidazole and NaCl were 82.5 and 165 mM, respectively. According to our simplified approach, the rtUlp1 at the final concentration of 10, 15, 20 and 25 lg/ml can cleave 95 % the of SUMO-tTbRII proteins containing different concentration of imidazole and NaCl following incubation at 30\u00b0C for 1 h. These data further indicates that the simple and rapid approach for the cleavage of the SUMO fusion protein is effective and convenient to the laboratorial application. We next determine the activity of the rtUlp1 in cleavage of the SUMO fusion protein. In our simplified procedure, the activity of the purified rtUlp1 is 5.6 U/ll and the specific activity is 2.8 9 10 4 U/mg. Our results showed that cleavage of the SUMO fusion protein can be successfully carried out by the simplified and rapid approach. The simplified method has two major advantages over the previous experiment procedures: (1) the purified rtUlp1 without desalting and dialyzing is able to cleave directly the SUMO fusion proteins; (2) the subtraction of the process of desalting and dialysis results in reducing the loss of the rtUlp1. Thus, a simple, efficient and novel approach described in our study is expected to be applicable for the cleavage of SUMO fusion proteins in general.",
