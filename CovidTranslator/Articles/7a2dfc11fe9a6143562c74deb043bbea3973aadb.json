Emerging infectious diseases are those with increasing incidence at local, regional, or international scales, and are spreading from epicenters to new geographic areas. The surveillance, study and control of EIDs is a complex interdisciplinary effort, crossing international borders and involving the collaborative efforts of scientists, clinicians, and political leaders from many disciplines and backgrounds to protect human health.",

            "text": "According to a comprehensive literature review performed by Taylor et al. (2001) at the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, 1415 species of infectious organisms known to be pathogenic to humans were identified. The human pathogens tabulated by this study included an assortment of 217 viruses and prions, 538 bacteria and rickettsia, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa and 287 helminths. The majority of these (61%) were zoonotic infections transmitted from animals to humans. Of the 175 pathogenic species associated with diseases considered to be 'emerging', 135 (75%) were zoonotic. The study found that protozoan and virus pathogens were particularly likely to emerge, and that the helminths were less likely to do so. Interestingly, no association was found between route of transmission and emergence in this study. An updated literature survey from the Centre for Infectious Diseases at the same institution (University of Edinburgh) was published in 2005 by Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria. This study identified 1407 species of human pathogens, 58% of which were zoonotic. Of the total, 177 were regarded as 'emerging' or 're-emerging' pathogens. The emerging and re-emerging zoonotic pathogens were most likely to have the broadest host ranges. The authors noted that although zoonotic pathogens constitute a significant source for emerging and re-EIDs, only a small minority of them would prove capable of causing major epidemics in the human population -but the H5N1 influenza strain could prove to be an exception.",

International travel related to tourism, commerce, relief efforts, work and study means that humans are increasingly in direct or indirect contact with previously isolated, remote populations and ecosystems. The challenge is that travelers returning home may harbor exotic infections that are still in the incubation stage. During the acute stage of illness, non-specific flu-like clinical signs and symptoms and locally available laboratory tests may not suggest the correct diagnosis to local healthcare providers. Thus, infections acquired during travel may be transmitted to others in the community by returned travelers before the diagnosis of disease can be made. In addition to international travelers, imported animals, birds, foods and insects from abroad, especially from tropical developing countries, can also pose a significant threat to the public health of receiving countries by serving as means of transportation for pathogens into new geographic areas. Local, national, and international surveillance and reporting systems are necessary to detect and track new or EIDs, educate the public, and control outbreaks on local and global scales.",

Given slow progress to date of health education efforts, commitment to and acceptance of recommended prophylactic interventions (vaccines, chemoprophylaxis, personal protection equipment, etc.) and adoption of positive behavior changes by international travelers, the burden of detection for imported infectious diseases among returning travelers will fall on individual healthcare providers and the public health officials to whom they report.",

One pattern consists of rare events when direct animal-to-human transmission of an animal pathogen occurs, but then direct human-to-human transmission maintains the infection in the human population for a limited time or permanently. Examples of diseases with this transmission pattern are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A, Ebola virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The second pattern of transmission is where human infections with animal pathogens result from repeated episodes of direct animal-to-human transmission, or of repeated vector-mediated animal-to-human transmission, and the infections are not usually propagated by human-to-human transmission. Examples of diseases with this transmission pattern are rabies and other lyssa viruses, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, Hantavirus, and the agents of Lyme borreliosis, plague, tularemia, leptospirosis and ehrlichiosis.",
