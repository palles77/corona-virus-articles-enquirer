            "text": "Our objective was to study the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS). Among 71 SDS patients included in the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry, 10 received HSCT between 1987 and 2004 in five institutions. The indications were bone marrow failure in five cases, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemia in five cases. The median follow-up of patients who survived without relapse is 6.9 years (3.1-16.8 years). The conditioning regimen consisted of a busulfan-cyclophosphamide combination (n \u00bc 6) or total body irradiation plus chemotherapy (n \u00bc 4). Six patients received stem cells from unrelated donors and four from identical siblings. Engraftment was complete in eight patients and unassessable in two patients. These latter two patients died of infections 32 and 36 days after HSCT, with grade IV graft-versus-host disease and multiorgan dysfunction. A third patient died from an acute respiratory distress syndrome 17 months after HSCT with progressive granulocytic sarcoma. One patient had an MDS relapse 4 months after HSCT and died 10 months later. The overall 5-year event-free survival rate is 60715%. We conclude that HSCT is feasible for patients with SDS who develop bone marrow failure or malignant transformation. Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS) (OMIN260400) is a multisystem autosomal recessive disorder characterized by exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, bony metaphyseal dysostosis, mild intellectual retardation, and variable neutropenia. 1 Almost all patients have a mutation in the SBDS gene located on chromosome 7. 2 Bone marrow failure and myelodysplasia/acute leukemia are the main life-threatening complications. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only potentially curative treatment for these latter patients. Only 24 HSCT procedures have been described in this setting, in 18 separate publications. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Here we report the outcomes of 10 SDS patients included in the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry who underwent HSCT during the last 15 years.",

A total of 71 patients were included in the SDS database, and a complete report of the survey, analyzed at the cut-off date of March 2003, has been published elsewhere. 21 In all, 11 patients developed bone marrow failure, which was transient in five cases and persistent (43 months) in six cases. Among these latter six patients, the patient who did not receive HSCT died. Eight patients developed MDS/leukemia, of whom three patients who were not transplanted died. SBDS gene mutations were evaluated as described elsewhere. 2",

Bone marrow aplasia and myelodysplasia/AL appear to be the most serious complications of SDS, and are always fatal despite conventional management with transfusions and chemotherapy. In SDS, AL is diagnosed on the basis of cytologic criteria. It can, however, be difficult to distinguish between bone marrow aplasia and myelodysplasia on the sole basis of cytologic bone marrow studies. Indeed, cellular dysplasia is present in both instances and the cytologic aspects do not correspond to the FAB classification of myelodysplasias. It is therefore crucial to follow cytologic bone marrow studies by cytogenetic examination in order to distinguish between simple bone marrow depletion and clonal progression ('myelodysplasia'). In addition, the presence of a cytogenetic anomaly of iso chromosome 7, or a deletion of chromosome 20, as found in one of our patients, has also been observed in patients without transfusion requirements and with nonfatal outcome, 7,23,24 complicating the decision to proceed with HSCT.",

Full and sustained engraftment was observed in eight patients, arguing against a major stromal defect in SDS. 25 Despite the small number of patients, we found a significant difference in event-free survival between patients receiving HSCT for bone marrow aplasia and those undergoing the procedure for leukemic transformation. Such a difference, albeit nonsignificant, was also observed among the 23 published cases of HSCT for SDS for which this information is mentioned (11 deaths or relapses among 17 patients with MDS/AL; and one death among six patients with bone marrow failure, P \u00bc 0.07). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Several factors may explain the poor results of HSCT for myelodysplasia/AL in SDS. HSCT failed to correct the leukemia in one of our patients and in three of the 15 patients described in the literature. In addition, patients with SDS appear to be more susceptible to the toxicity of the HSCT procedure than are patients with other myelodysplastic disorders associated with monosomy 7, like the Kostmann syndrome 26 and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. 27 This susceptibility may be related to older age or to disease characteristics. Indeed, there is a marked age difference between patients receiving HSCT for bone marrow aplasia and for leukemic transformation, both in our series and in the literature (median age 4.5 and 13 years, respectively). Several risk factors could progress with age in this setting, including the nutritional consequences of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, liver disease, repeated infections and cardiac disorders. A risk of cardiomyopathy has been reported in patients with SDS in the absence of HSCT, fibrosis and necrotic lesions being found in 50% of SDS patients at necropsy; this was also the case of patient UPN 233015081, whose sibling died of cardiomyopathy. It is therefore necessary to carefully assess nutritional, cardiac and hepatic status prior to transplantation. All the patients received a myeloablative-conditioning regimen prior to HSCT, usually consisting of the busulfancyclophosphamide combination. In patients with bone marrow aplasia, who are generally under 5 years of age, this conditioning appears effective and well tolerated. Stability of the engraftment over several years suggests that more intensive conditioning is not warranted. In contrast, the poor results in patients with leukemic transformation suggest that milder conditioning would be inappropriate and that very careful attention must be paid to nutritional status.",

Our results indicate that BMT is associated with significant morbidity, potentially owing to pre-existing poor nutritional status, immune deficiency and/or the underlying disease. These patients should be closely monitored for infections after HSCT, and their nutritional status should be optimized before the procedure.",
