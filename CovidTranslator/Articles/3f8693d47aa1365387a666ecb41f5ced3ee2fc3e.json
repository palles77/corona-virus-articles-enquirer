In a 91-day rat study, pecan shell fiber was administered at dietary concentrations of 0 (control), 50 000, 100 000 or 150 000 ppm. There was no effect of the ingredient on body weight of males or females or food consumption of females. Statistically significant increases in food consumption were observed throughout the study in 100 000 and 150 000 ppm males, resulting in intermittent decreases in food efficiency (150 000 ppm males only) that were not biologically relevant. All animals survived and no adverse clinical signs or functional changes were attributable to the test material. There were no toxicologically relevant changes in hematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis parameters or organ weights in rats ingesting pecan shell fiber. Any macroscopic or microscopic findings were incidental, of normal variation and/or of minimal magnitude for test substance association. Pecan shell fiber was non-mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation test and non-clastogenic in a mouse peripheral blood micronucleus test. Based on these results, pecan shell fiber has an oral subchronic (13-week) no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 150 000 ppm in rats and is not genotoxic at the doses analyzed.",

In an attempt to increase the fiber content of the diet, developers of food ingredients have created new fiber ingredients, some of which are produced by genetically modified organisms. However, due to increased demand by consumers for foods containing \"natural\" ingredients, there is an increased need for new fiber ingredients from \"natural\" sources.",

In 2014, approximately 264 million pounds of pecan nuts (in-shell) were produced in the United mum level of 3000 ppm (0.3%)) [19] , pecan shell fiber is not GRAS for other purposes. Under section 201(s) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the use of a substance, rather than the substance itself, is eligible for a GRAS determination [9] . Although humans may have been ingesting small amounts of pecan shell fiber in the past, they have not been eating the ingredient at the considerably higher levels expected when used as a source of fiber. To support a higher level of consumption in humans, safe consumption of high levels of pecan shell fiber must be demonstrated in experimental animals. Genotoxicity studies should also be conducted because the potential for genotoxicity due to small levels of contaminants would increase with higher levels of consumption. This publication presents results of a bacterial reverse mutation test, an in vivo mouse micronucleus test and a 13-week feeding study in rats that were conducted to expand the use of pecan shell fiber in human food. A search of publicly available information indicated that studies of this nature have not been previously conducted for pecan shell fiber.",

The concentrations were based on the results of a fourteen day dose range finding study in rats. Test diets were prepared weekly by thoroughly blending the test substance into the basal diet with a high-speed mixer. All prepared test and control diets were stored under refrigeration until use. At the initial, middle and final diet preparation, a sample of the test (neat) substance was retained for stability analysis. During the first week of the study, samples from each dietary concentration were taken at first presentation of the diet and on Days 4, 7 and 10 to verify the stability of the test material in the dietary matrix. Samples were collected from the top, middle and bottom of the mixer during preparation of the initial diet to evaluate the homogeneity of the test substance in the matrix. Samples of representative animal diets from the control, low, mid and high dose groups were also taken to verify concentrations in test diets. All samples were stored frozen until analyzed. The concentration of the test material in the neat substance and diet was measured using gallic acid (a substance present in the test material) as a marker, and analyzed values were compared to expected (target) values based on the concentration of gallic acid in the test substance and the amount added to the diet. Prior to sample analysis, the suitability of the method of detection for gallic acid (high performance liquid chromatography) was demonstrated. Method validation included, but was not limited to, determination of linearity, precision and accuracy.

The volume of each application was 10 ml/kg bw. The vehicle control (cottonseed oil) was administered by gavage three times per day to vehicle control mice (five mice/sex), in an identical manner as the test group animals. The positive control material (cyclophosphamide) was administered once intraperitoneally to a separate group of five mice/sex, at a dose of 40 mg/kg bw. Samples of blood were taken from the tail vein 44 h (all groups) and 68 h after the last dose (vehicle and test material groups only). Blood cells were immediately fixed in ultracold methanol. At least 24 h after fixation, blood cells were washed in Hank's balanced salt solution, and spun in a centrifuge at 600 \u00d7 g for five min (4 \u2022 C). After discarding the supernatant, blood cell populations were identified using specific antibodies against CD71 (expressed only at the surface of immature erythrocytes) and CD61 (expressed at the surface of platelets). DNA content of micronuclei was determined by the use of a DNA specific stain (propidium iodide, PI). Anti-CD71 and anti-CD61 antibodies were then labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and phycoerythrin (PE), respectively, and samples were analyzed using flow cytometry. Particles were differentiated using forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) parameters of the flow cytometer. Fluorescence intensities were recorded on the FL1, FL2 and FL3 channels for FITC, PE and PI respectively. For all dose groups (including positive and negative controls), 10 000 polychromatic erythrocytes per animal were scored for the incidence of micronucleated immature erythrocytes. To detect a possible cytotoxic effect of the test item, the ratio between immature and mature erythrocytes was determined. The result is expressed as relative PCE (rel. PCE = proportion of polychromatic (immature) erythrocytes among total erythrocytes). The test substance was judged positive if any test group exhibited a statistically significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated immature erythrocytes compared with the concurrent negative control and the results are outside the distribution of the historical negative control data (e.g., Poisson-based 95% control limits).",

Food consumption of males receiving 100 000 or 150 000 ppm pecan shell fiber was higher than control, which resulted in decreased feed efficiency at the high dose only. The fact that feed efficiency was decreased in high dose males is not unexpected, given the high dose of material administered (9947.5 mg/kg/day) and the fact that the ingredient is primarily composed of insoluble fiber. There was no effect of the test material on absolute organ weights, or organ weights relative to body weight or brain weight. All macroscopic and microscopic findings (including a renal carcinoma in one mid dose female) were ruled incidental and unrelated to treatment. Renal tubular tumors have been observed sporadically in Sprague-Dawley rats of similar age [11, 15] .",

All changes except the decreases in TG in females are considered unrelated to test material, due to lack of a dose-response, correlative changes in histology, and/or findings in both sexes. All hematology and clinical chemistry values were within ranges reported for historical controls. However, because the TG values for all exposed groups of female animals were reduced by 22-29% compared to control, the decrease in TG is likely related to test material administration. Reductions in TG have been observed in rats consuming high levels of other fibers such as inulin-type fructans and rice bran [2, 4] and are not toxicologically relevant, because a decrease in TG is generally thought of as a beneficial effect. The lack of an effect on cholesterol is consistent with the fact that in rats, cellulose is neutral with respect to blood cholesterol [14] .",

Because at least five concentrations could be evaluated (as required by the guideline), the assay is valid and appropriate for assessing the potential of the material to cause mutations. The results of the peripheral blood micronucleus study in the mouse show that pecan shell fiber is not clastogenic or aneugenic at a dose of 10 000 mg/kg bw, approximately the same daily dose that was administered safely to rats for 91 days.",

The mean values for treated mice at 44 h were 0.22% (males) and 0.28% (females). The mean value observed in the male group was within the range of the concurrent negative control as well as within the historical control limits of the negative control. The mean value observed in the female group was statistically significantly increased compared to the concurrent negative control. However, the value was within the range of the historical control limits of the negative control. Therefore, the significant increase in MN-PCE in treated females at 44 h with respect to the concurrent control only did not meet all criteria for a positive response. For the 68 h measurement, the mean values of both males and females (0.25% and 0.2%, respectively) were within the range of the concurrent negative control and historical controls. Under the conditions of the test, pecan shell fiber did not cause a biologically relevant increase in the frequency of MN-PCE. The assay was considered valid as the MN-PCE frequencies for the negative control rats were within the expected historical range and an adequate positive control response was obtained (3.51% MN-PCE in males and 1.90% MN-PCE in females).",
