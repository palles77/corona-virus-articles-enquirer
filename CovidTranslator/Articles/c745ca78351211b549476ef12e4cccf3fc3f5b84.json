            "text": "Within the last 15 years, two related coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SARS]-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]-CoV) expanded their host range to include humans, with increased virulence in their new host. Coronaviruses were recently found to have little intrinsic disorder compared with many other virus families. Because intrinsically disordered regions have been proposed to be important for rewiring interactions between virus and host, we investigated the conservation of intrinsic disorder and secondary structure in coronaviruses in an evolutionary context. We found that regions of intrinsic disorder are rarely conserved among different coronavirus protein families, with the primary exception of the nucleocapsid. Also, secondary structure predictions are only conserved across 50-80% of sites for most protein families, with the implication that 20-50% of sites do not have conserved secondary structure prediction. Furthermore, nonconserved structure sites are significantly less constrained in sequence divergence than either sites conserved in the secondary structure or sites conserved in loop. Avoiding regions symptomatic of conformational flexibility such as disordered sites and sites with nonconserved secondary structure to identify potential broad-specificity antiviral targets, only one sequence motif (five residues or longer) remains from the >10,000 starting sites across all coronaviruses in this study. The identified sequence motif is found within the nonstructural protein (NSP) 12 and constitutes an antiviral target potentially effective against the present day and future coronaviruses. On shorter evolutionary timescales, the SARS and MERS clades have more sequence motifs fulfilling the criteria applied. Interestingly, many motifs map to NSP12 making this a prime target for coronavirus antivirals.",

The MERS-CoV proteome is primarily composed of two polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1ab; the latter is generated by a -1 ribosomal slippage frameshift. These proteins are cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs). NSPs 1-10 are products of both polyproteins, whereas NSPs 12-16 are only yielded by ORF1ab. NSP11 is unique to ORF1a ( van Boheemen et al. 2012) . Structural proteins envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) are elements of the physical structure that encloses the viral genome and come from distinct reading frames, unlike ORF1a and ORF1ab, which come from overlapping reading frames. Additionally, the structural proteins are the product of subgenomic mRNAs that are joined during discontinuous negative RNA strand synthesis (van Boheemen et al. 2012) . Finally, NS3 protein (NS3), NS4A protein (NS4A), NS4B protein (NS4B), NS5 protein (NS5), and Orf8b protein encompass the remainder of the proteome and also arise from distinct reading frames (van Boheemen et al. 2012) .",

However, because most viruses pose no major threat to their host, they pass by unnoticed leaving the majority of virus genome space uncharted. With the availability of costefficient genome sequencing technology, and recent developments in the field of viral metagenomics, large-scale identification of viral genome space is on the rise (Rosario and Breitbart 2011; Mokili et al. 2012) . By exploring viral diversity, critical components constituting a viral genus' fitness can be evaluated. Examples such as the common influenza virus illustrate the rapidity of viral gene mutation and in order to maintain immune protection, an annual flu vaccination is recommended. Underway efforts aim to generate broadly neutralizing vaccines whose design accounts for the genomic sequences of multiple types of influenza virus to eliminate frequent re-vaccination against the flu Ross 2011, 2012) . Development of broadly neutralizing vaccines often relies on the consensus or ancestral sequences of extant viral sequences in order to provide greater coverage for related viruses (Kesturu et al. 2006) . Unfortunately, consensus sequences can be misleading, and ancestral sequence reconstruction is error-prone for quickly diverging sequences (McCloskey et al. 2014 ). In addition, viruses with compact genomes often express proteins with structural disorder that may undergo structural transformations. Although these transformer proteins, like VP40 in Ebola, are masters at changing their structure, and thus expanding their functional repertoire as needed for the life cycle of the virus (Bornholdt et al. 2013) , flexible regions are potentially important in rewiring protein-protein interactions between the virus and its host (Le Breton et al. 2011; Ortiz et al. 2013; Gitlin et al. 2014) .",

            "text": "The flexibility trait of many viral proteins is a complicating factor in vaccine development. For instance, Dengue virus exhibits serotype-specific antibody affinity that causes antibodydependent enhancement, an obstacle in the development of Dengue vaccines that protects against all four serotypes (Flipse and Smit 2015) . To overcome the hurdle posed by structural flexibility, we propose an additional screening step in identifying potential vaccine or antiviral targets that considers the structural flexibility of the viral proteins. The Structural Genomics Initiatives increased their success rate by excluding proteins predicted to be structurally disordered (Slabinski et al. 2007) . A similar approach can perhaps benefit vaccine development. Furthermore, to make this approach robust to potential mutations, minimizing loss in efficacy or resistance, the evolutionary context of sequence and structure must be considered. Thus, we suggest expanding the concept of broadly neutralizing vaccines/antivirals by increasing the diversity of viruses considered if possible. Sites conserved for sequence, structure, and with low disorder propensity among diverse virus protein homologs are very likely to be constrained from 1) changing sequence on evolutionary time scales and 2) undergoing real-time structural transitions. These sites have potential as targets for broad-specificity antivirals or vaccines because conservation makes them broad-specificity and low dynamics avoids targeting a conformational ensemble, which is not only difficult (Yu et al. 2016) , but that may change as the sequence diverges (Siltberg-Liberles et al. 2011) .",

It was reported that Coronaviridae has very low disorder content (mean disorder 3.68%) (Pushker et al. 2013) . Coronaviridae contains two subfamilies: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are part the Coronavirinae subfamily, from here on referred to as coronavirus (CoV). The lack of disorder is intriguing because it may be important for rewiring interactions between viral proteins and host proteins (Ortiz et al. 2013 ) and providing opportunities to acquire novel functional sequence motifs (Gitlin et al. 2014) . Structural disorder has also been proposed to be important for viral viability, enabling multifunctionality and vigor in response to changes in the environment (Xue et al. 2014) . Given the low fraction of structural disorder reported across Coronaviridae, we set out to investigate the conservation of structural disorder and secondary structure across CoV. Sites identified as conserved for structure and lacking disorder can be considered to be vulnerable and druggable in the proteomes of coronaviruses. The structural divergence capacity of these regions is limited, leaving a wider range of the present and emergent coronaviruses susceptible to the effects of potential broadly neutralizing anti-CoV therapies targeting these sites. We will refer to these sites as target sites.",

BLAST searches of the ORF1ab protein were performed, using start and end positions as detailed in the ORF1ab NCBI Reference Sequence file, against the refseq_protein database. The sequences retrieved from the BLAST output maintained the following cutoff: >30% sequence identity and >50% coverage relative to MERS-CoV sequence query. The 30% sequence identity and 50% query coverage cutoff strikes a balance between alignment quality and at least 10 sequences for most protein families. NSP1 (YP_009047202.1; 1-193), NSP2 (YP_009047202.1; 194-853), NS3 (YP_009047205.1), NS4A (YP_009047206.1), NS4B (YP_009047207.1), NS5 (YP_009047208.1), ORF8b protein (YP_009047212.1), and NSP11 (YP_009047203.1; 4378-4391) are not included in this study due to <10 BLAST hits.",

Betacoronavirus is represented in all phylogenies although the order of the individual subclades varies. Alphacoronavirus is often found as the sister clade or outgroup to betacoronavirus. Deltacoronavirus or gammacoronavirus are the most distantly related to the betacoronavirus. In the nucleocapsid phylogeny, gammacoronavirus is the first outgroup clade to betacoronavirus, and alphacoronavirus is the most distant outgroup. Most NSP trees exhibit some unresolved nodes at junctures immediately preceding terminal nodes. As an effect of the 50% majority rule, most of the 546 resolved nodes are well supported with posterior probability >0.9 for 82% and >0.99 for 68% (supplementary fig.

It should be noted that for NSP5, the entire alphacoronavirus clade is placed within the betacoronavirus clade, as a sister clade to the MERS clade (supplementary fig.

Recombination events are rather frequent in coronaviruses (Su et al. 2016) , and the MERS clade potentially underwent multiple recombination events as part of the host change (Zhang et al. 2016) .",

For instance, C145 in the middle of GSCGS in NSP5 is part of the catalytic dyad in the NSP5 protease (Yang et al. 2003) . For NSP12 and NSP13, which have the majority of all sites, no structures are available.

Continuing into the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (RdRP) in NSP12, four additional regions of target sites are found, and the last three regions are found in the C-terminal part. Importantly, in RdRP and in the C-terminal part are sites that are also conserved across all CoVs in this study.

Some protein products are only found in the MERS clade, and these were excluded from this study due to insufficient data. Furthermore, for other protein products, some clades may not be represented in our protein families if their proteins were too divergent. This was an important factor in determining the applied BLAST hit cutoffs, as relaxing cutoffs produced alignments with more gaps and increasing stringency reduced the representative pool. Because alignment quality is important due to the sensitivity of both Rate4Site and for phylogenetic reconstruction, the chosen cutoffs are suitable.

Although conformational flexibility is important for function, it also offers flexibility in what sequence motifs are on display. If these sequences are rapidly diverging, different sequence motifs will be displayed, reinforcing the notion that flexible regions are potentially important in rewiring protein-protein interactions between virus and host (Gitlin et al. 2014) . Although most CoV proteins have almost no intrinsic disorder, several CoV protein families have homologous sites that display loop in some sequences, helix in others and strands in some (table 3, supplementary fig. S3 , Supplementary Material online). These sites are not necessarily disordered but they may be conformationally flexible in realtime (with secondary structure transitions in the same sequence, making them difficult to predict) or on evolutionary time-scales (so that different secondary structure elements actually are present in different sequences). The C(HS) and C(L) sites make up approximately 50-80% of most multiple sequence alignments. With the common expectation that protein structure is more conserved than sequence these numbers are surprisingly low. Neither PSIPRED nor JPred consistently predicts the same state for 20-50% of all sites in these multiple sequence alignments.",

When secondary structure is not conserved for the same site in a multiple sequence alignment, it suggests that the secondary structure prediction may be 1) inaccurate, 2) not predicted with high confidence, or 3) the regions are indeed metamorphic; they can transition from one element to another.

            "text": "It should be noted that, despite the low amount of disordered sites in most CoV proteins, several regions are not conserved in disorder propensity across all sequences, but sometimes the different predictors disagree as in the case of NSP8. Clade-specific disordered regions resulting from indel events suggest that they are not essential to the critical functions of the protein, but could cause gain-and-loss of interactions with its hosts. However, when disorder propensity is only mildly fading for a region that is present across the protein family, it may be important for the fundamental function of the protein. The virus structural proteins that interact to form the virion commonly include an envelope protein, a membrane protein, and a capsid protein that together form the machinery that encases, transports, and releases the virus. The interactions between the structural proteins are often regulated by conformational changes like VP40 in Ebola (Bornholdt et al. 2013 ) and Envelope protein from Dengue virus (Zheng et al. 2014 ). Conformational changes to another. It should also be noted that two MERS clade specific inserts around position 241 and toward the C-terminal are consistently predicted to be highly disordered. With inserts and changing structural dynamics between clades or viruses, the questions become 1) which sequence motif are displayed and 2) to what extent are these sequence motifs displayed?",

Altogether, this suggests that various mechanisms for rewiring conformational and functional space are operating in the coronaviruses studied here. If regions symptomatic of conformational and functional flexibility can be avoided in order to identify broad-specificity antiviral targets with potential to be effective against coronaviruses of today and in the future, coronaviruses as a group may become more attractive drug targets for the pharmaceutical industry in the event an additional coronavirus changes host to include humans or increase its virulence.",
