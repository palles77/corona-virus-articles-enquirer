Furthermore, aggression can be categorized as offensive or defensive. Specific knowledge of the pattern and type of aggression is critical if effective intervention is to be accomplished. For the criteria of this definition to be met, it is assumed that organic causes of aggression (e.g., pain or intracranial mass) have been ruled out. Hematuria is the presence of blood in the urine; the presence of trace amounts of blood in the urine will not be obvious on gross appearance of a urine sample. Therefore any noticeable change in the color of urine observed by the owner is likely to be interpreted as \"blood in the urine.\" Further evaluation of the patient is necessary to determine whether or not the discoloration is associated with small blood clots in recently voided urine, blood-tinged urine, or brown or red urine. The presence of blood in the urine, whether gross or occult, is most often indicative of upper or lower urinary tract bleeding, although systemic coagulopathies and reproductive tract disorders may also cause hematuria. The presence of hemoglobin in urine (hemoglobinuria) is not necessarily a reflection of urinary tract disease. Systemic disorders (e.g., those leading to intravascular hemolysis) can be associated with significant hemoglobinuria in the presence of a normal urinary system. Owners are likely to interpret this clinical sign to be \"blood in the urine. \" In true hemoglobinuria, without hematuria, microscopic examination will reveal the absence of red blood cells (RBCs).",

However, not all patients with acute diarrhea have primary intestinal disease, such as those with renal or hepatic failure or hypoadrenocorticism; icterus, oral ulcers, muscle weakness, and so on may also be encountered. Fever, anorexia, and lethargy may also accompany acute diarrhea in the dog and cat. ",

Physiologic loss of hair (e.g., normal shedding or hereditary hair loss such as in the Rex cat breed) is excluded from this definition. In clinical practice, hair loss, with and without pruritus, is among the most common reasons a cat or dog is presented. In most cases the loss of hair is secondary to some underlying disorder rather than being a primary event. The distribution of hair loss is important in that it can be characteristic of the underlying cause. Alopecia can be classified on the basis of distribution as (1) diffuse, (2) regional, (3) multifocal, and (4) focal. The causes for hair loss are varied and often complex. Abnormalities of follicular structure may be inherited, ranging from complete absence of hair follicles to selective absence of follicles that produce hair of a specific color. Inflammatory skin diseases that incorporate the hair follicle may disrupt hair growth and maintenance. Bacterial folliculitis, demodectic mange, and follicular hyperkeratosis are examples.",

Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is associated with an increase in the number of germinal centers within the lymph node and an infiltrate of plasma cells. In neoplastic lymph nodes, tumor cells may invade the sinuses (metastatic), gradually destroying the normal node architecture, or the architecture of the lymph node is entirely replaced by malignant lymphocytes (lymphosarsoma)-that is, histologically the sinuses are obliterated and germinal centers cannot be found.",

The terms seizure, convulsion, epilepsy, epileptic attack, and \"fit\" all describe a clinical sign that is characterized by paroxysmal involuntary contraction of a series of voluntary muscles with a generally short duration, typically followed by a change in behavior. Epileptic seizure, the most common form of seizure disorder in dogs, has been described as having four component phases: (1) prodromal phase, the period of time immediately before a seizure; (2) aura, behavior suggesting that the patient is aware that seizure activity is impending; (3) ictal phase, characterized by actual seizure activity, and (4) postictal phase, the period after cessation of seizure activity, often manifesting as increased anxiety, water or food consumption, and/or transient blindness. Seizure activity may be self-limiting (one or two seizures per 24-hour period) or continuous (status epilepticus), which can be life-threatening and warrants immediate therapeutic intervention. In addition, seizures are classified as focal (facial twitching or bizarre behavioral manifestations) or generalized; generalized seizures are further characterized as tonic-clonic, clonic, myoclonic, atonic, or absence types. Seizures result from disorders of the brain that cause spontaneous depolarizations and excitation of cerebral neurons. As a presenting problem, seizures are much more common in the dog than in the cat. Such disorders may originate from extracranial causes, metabolic or toxic diseases, and intracranial causes (e.g., organic brain disease). When seizures occur in the absence of detectable organic or metabolic CNS abnormalities, the seizures are described as idiopathic.

            "text": "Urinary incontinence is the lack of normal ability to prevent discharge of urine from the bladder. Urinary incontinence should be suspected when an animal that previously exhibited normal control of urination begins passing urine at times or in places that are inappropriate. Determining whether or not the presenting complaint of inappropriate urinary behavior is involuntary can be a formidable task in a dog or cat. Distinguishing between voluntary and involuntary urination is fundamental to the diagnostic plan. The normal micturition reflex is a result of the complex interaction of the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. Normal control of micturition can be divided into a series of nervous pathways: 1. Sensory neurons have stretch receptors in the bladder wall that relay information through ascending spinal cord tracts to the brainstem and somesthetic cortex of the frontoparietal lobes. This pathway is the basis for the perception of a full bladder. 2. The frontoparietal motor cortex projects to the brainstem reticular formation centers for micturition, which are responsible for storage and evacuation of urine. 3. From these centers, reticulospinal tracts descend the spinal cord to influence gray matter centers responsible for the storage or evacuation of urine. For evacuation, the visceral efferent neurons in the sacral segments that innervate the detrusor muscle via the pelvic nerves are facilitated. The somatic efferent neurons in the sacral segments that innervate the striated urethralis muscle via the pudendal nerve are inhibited. Facilitation of these pudendal somatic neurons prevents urination. Urinary incontinence is the physical manifestation of any one of several disorders affecting voluntary urine retention in the bladder. Neurologic lesions involving either upper motor or lower motor neuron segments of the micturition reflex arc result in urinary incontinence. A paralytic bladder usually results in bladder overdistension and urine dribbling. Urine can be easily expressed by manual compression of the bladder in affected patients. A \"cord bladder\" is caused by a lesion between the brain and the spinal reflex center of micturition. There is usually temporary bladder paralysis followed by involuntary reflex micturition subsequent to manual compression.",

When an animal is presented with acute visual loss, the owner is usually describing a bilateral ocular disease problem or the possibility of a CNS disorder. Acute unilateral visual loss problems are not often recognized except by the very astute animal owner or observer. For the veterinarian, initial assessment of the animal with acute visual loss depends initially on confirming that the ocular media are clear and allow light to pass from the anterior ocular segment and reach the photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) in the posterior ocular segment. Transillumination should be used to evaluate the ocular media. Such conditions as acute bilateral uveitis, severe corneal edema, bilateral acute keratitis, rapidly developing metabolic cataracts, or acute cyclitis with vitreous involvement may alter the ocular media to interfere with light transmission. Both direct and indirect pupillary responses should be evaluated while evaluating the anterior ocular media. Once it has been determined that light can reach the posterior ocular segment, a fundus evaluation should be done. Fundic abnormalities associated with acute visual loss may include acute chorioretinitis, often with exudative retinal detachments; acute choroidal hemorrhages, often associated with abnormal blood pressure in chronic renal disease; and acute optic neuritis. Acute visual loss in the dog without accompanying fundic lesions that can be seen on ophthalmoscopic examination may be associated with a retrobulbar optic neuritis or with the syndrome of sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome (SARDS) in the dog. SARDS is poorly understood. The syndrome appears to involve middle-aged to old female dogs, and there is a breed predilection for the dachshund. The visual loss may first start as nyctalopia and progress over a period of weeks to complete visual loss. In some cases the visual loss is generalized and acute. Associated systemic signs of PD, PU, polyphagia, obesity, and hepatomegaly may be present. Laboratory profiles may show abnormal differentials in the WBC count, elevated liver enzymes, an abnormal response to ACTH stimulation testing, or an abnormal response to low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing. The fundus may appear absolutely normal, or early signs of retinal thinning and atrophy may be evident. Differential diagnosis with optic neuritis is based on electroretinographic (ERG) testing; the ERG response is flat in SARDS but is normal in optic neuritis. The cause of SARDS is unknown.",
