The most prominent of these are microelectronics, biotechnology, aerospace, and communications technologies. Compared to more traditional sectors, these activities involve different workforce demographics, novel environments, potential exposures to incompletely studied physical, chemical, and biologic hazards under rapid and changing workplace conditions. These characteristics require the development of new paradigms for occupational health practice and workplace hazard control. The purpose of this chapter is to outline some of the workplace health issues in these sectors, focusing on microelectronics and biotechnology, and to propose directions future practice might profitably evolve.",

            "text": "Unlike conventional manufacturing, which may entail sharp distinctions between the work experience of minimally skilled hourly workers, skilled technicians, and supervisors, the new high technology workplace usually requires a substantially higher proportion of workers with advanced skills and integration. Engineers and scientists often work closely with skilled technicians. Many will perform multiple, complex tasks which are frequently changing. Moreover, for reasons including economic volatility, advancement opportunities, and competitive hiring practices, workers in these industries tend to change employers, job duties, and locations frequently, creating complex work histories. For obvious reasons, the workforce in most of the sector is relatively younger, more diverse in ethnicity and gender, and there are few unions or trade organizations relative to traditional sectors.",

            "text": "The work environment can be even more radically different. Most new technologies involve manipulation of materials and products that are intrinsically costly, such as a silicon wafer or a genetically modified sow, so production systems are organized around product quality assurance. One consequence, evident in both the electronics and biotechnology industries, is the shift of production from factory environments to 'clean' rooms -specialized, limited-access work areas where workers wear protective clothing and equipment that limits the possibility of contaminating the product physically, chemically, or biologically. Lighting, ventilation and other ambient conditions are set to protect the product, creating environments with unusual characteristics. For example, any particle inadvertently introduced into the air in semiconductor wafer fabrication rooms (fabs) is rapidly removed by filtration. Likewise, reverse isolation techniques are used to breed genetically engineered animals for biomedical uses. In each setting, the increasingly critical need to separate product (the wafers) from people to avoid particulate contamination -through automation, robotics, and separately exhausted enclosures -has led to reductions in the potential exposure to production chemicals. However, workers frequently wear uncomfortable personal protective equipment, have more limited opportunities for breaks, and have little flexibility to make environmental or task accommodations (such as opening windows) that can enhance and humanize the work experience in more traditional settings. Protection of the product may also impose constraints on the extent to which mechanical aspects of work can be modified, e.g., enhancing ergonomic risks, as occurs in the healthcare sector (see Chapter 17) , although use of automation and robotics can reduce some ergonomic hazards.",

The following is a brief overview; more complete discussion can be found in the suggested readings. [2] [3] [4] The first step is making the wafer -a large round platter of almost pure silicon or, less commonly, gallium arsenide. Wafer manufacturing occurs in a few separate dedicated manufacturing facilities, which are not part of the semiconductor wafer fabrication environment. To achieve this, quartz is reduced to silicon under very high temperature, ground to a powder then gassified in hydrogen and chlorine to trichlorosilane, which is reduced to pure silicon. A small crystal 'seed' is then dipped into the liquid silicon at the ends of a rod, allowing the crystal to grow while intentionally introducing very small quantities of impurities ('doping') such as boron, arsenic or phosphorus. These huge crystals are then machined (including grinding, slicing, and lapping), etched (in acid) and polished to form the wafer on which hundreds of chips (die) will then be fabricated.",

First a layer of silicon dioxide is applied, which is then protected by coating with a layer of photoresist. Photoresists contain light-reactive chemicals, polymers, and carrier solvents. As in conventional photography, the wafer is exposed to a light source, intense ultraviolet (UV) light. The light passes through a mask, containing the pattern for the circuitry, causing polymerization or solubilization of the exposed photoresist, dependent upon the type of photoresist (negative or positive). The resulting surface is developed, requiring use of chemicals, primarily strong bases. For the typical positive resist, exposed areas of solubilized photoresist are removed by the developer. The resulting unprotected silicon dioxide surface can then be etched off by application of etchantsacids (wet etch) or excited gases (plasma etch).",

In thin film, thin layers of materials, including silicon, silicon dioxide, and silicon nitride, are placed onto the surface of the wafer, in furnaces or chemical vapor deposition tools, to provide a layer that protects the underlying surface or serves as an insulator.

Complaints related to heat and protective clothing occur, although significant heat-related illness does not. Complaints of difficulty hearing also occur in the fab environment, which is noisy but rarely exceeds noise action levels. Noise-related hearing loss does not appear to occur, with the possible exception of workers in mechanical support areas outside the fab. 4 The greatest concerns in the industry have centered around reproductive health and cancer. Spontaneous abortion excess was first reported in a Massachusetts company in the mid 1980s. 8 This prompted two large studies on an industry-wide basis, which confirmed excesses of about 1.4fold in the fab overall and ranging up to 70% in certain job categories. 9,10 Although the specific cause for the early fetal losses could not be ascertained with certainty, the clustering around jobs with exposure to photoresist solvents implicated ethylene glycol ethers because of their known reproductive/developmental toxicity in animals. In response, the industry has substituted less toxic glycol ethers, such as propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, or other alternative solvents, such as ethyl lactate, for these compounds. In addition, the industry has enhanced some engineering and other controls and generally created procedures that facilitate accommodations or transfers for concerned pregnant employees. Only a portion of the observed excess of spontaneous abortion in one of the studies could be explained on the basis of potential exposure to glycol ethers; excesses in other areas, such as etch, remain unexplained, raising the question of other contributing factors, e.g., unrecognized developmental toxicity of another agent or other factors, such as ergonomic factors or stress.",

Unfortunately, even the more intensive approach, providing questionnaire and medical information on a regular basis, will be of limited value in addressing the major unanswered questions about worker risks. For one thing, the outcomes of interest are not known with any certainty, and include a wide range of possible health effects; there is no single specific condition to perform surveillance around. Traditional health surveillance is intrinsically crosssectional in nature, and therefore unlikely to provide a barometer to track more chronic effects of exposure should these occur. Moreover, the absence of linkage between symptoms or other health information and exposure reduces the ability to compare rates among groups with divergent exposures of interest. High employee turnover, combined with rapid changes in production processes and exposure patterns, further compound the difficulties associated with a traditional medical surveillance approach.",

In order to function, an inserted gene must be accompanied by gene regulatory sequences that allow expression of the gene within the plant. At present, many gene inserts also contain a marker for antibiotic resistance which is necessary to select for plant cells which have successfully acquired the desired gene insert, but such sequences are either not utilized in newer products or are removed from these products during development. The inserted gene is generally intended to produce a functional protein, although in some cases (antisense DNA mediated resistance to viral pathogens), no protein expression occurs. The protein products used in food and feed crops fall into several categories. 12 They may express pesticidal activity as in the case of the Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) toxin, or confer resistance to herbicides by incorporating a resistant variant of a normally occurring enzymatic activity or by allowing a plant to degrade a particular herbicide. The inserted gene may result in new plant structural proteins, or may confer new or enhanced enzymatic activity upon the plant so that new nutrients or enhanced levels of nutrients are produced. Inserted genetic material may also act by down-regulating or up-regulating existing genes, and may potentially have unintended effects upon other genes within the plant cell either by direct insertion into those genes or by indirect regulatory (so-called pleotropic) effects. 13 Potential novel occupational exposures resulting from the production of genetically modified feed and food crops include: (1) exposure to the novel protein; (2) exposure to the products of enzymatic activity conferred by the inserted protein, which may be either anticipated or unanticipated;",

While most agents result in the transient, epichromosomal presence of the novel genes, some agents (primarily retroviruses) can permanently incorporate novel DNA into the human genome. 18 In general, large inocula are needed to have a significant effect, since the agents do not replicate. However, large accidental inoculations or inadvertent infection with replication-competent strains could cause serious occupational illness. Also the possibility remains that a replication-incompetent strain could acquire the ability to replicate via unintended genetic events or as a result of co-infection with another viral strain. 18 Likewise, laboratories will likely utilize genetically modified, rather than traditional laboratory animals. Until now this has been largely limited to transgenic rodents whose potential to spread infection to humans appears limited. However, with the advent of larger genetically modified species, such as pigs, new possibilities arise, such as human transmission of new agents or more efficient transmission of old ones. Many if not most of the major viral infections of humans are suspected to have had animal origins, and many viruses are quite remarkable in the range of hosts they may infect. The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), traced to food workers handling wild civet carcasses, is a compelling example.

If immunologic studies of exposed workers are performed, consideration should be given both to novel and to the far greater number of non-novel antigenic proteins present. 2. In evaluating and managing the infectious/ transmissible risks of recombinant vectors and modified organisms in the laboratory settingincluding microbes, plants, and animals -current guidelines from the National Institutes of Health 16 and the American Society for Microbiology 17 appear adequate. However, it is important to recognize that these criteria are based upon planned (or readily anticipated) and controlled events. Unanticipated genetic events may occur, particularly in animal species, with resulting novel pathogens, although the likelihood and extent of such events is unclear. Practitioners must therefore remain alert to the possibility of unique infectious presentations within the biotechnology workforce. 3. In evaluating the risks of biopharmaceutical products, the occupational physician should consider several characteristics which may not be evident on casual consideration of available toxicology data. These factors include the following.",

This is particularly true for dry operations such as grinding or milling. While it is highly likely that, in most situations, no unusual effect will arise, exposure should be carefully controlled using industrial hygiene and personal protective equipment as necessary. The occupational physician should be vigilant for anticipated and even unanticipated clinical effects, especially those which might be mediated by direct action of the product upon the lining of the respiratory and/or gastrointestinal tracts. 5.

These include (1) alarm, during which personal protective equipment including self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is donned prior to and during transportation to the incident scene; (2) entry, when the burning structure is breached and rescue operations begin; (3) suppression, involving venting and extinguishment of the fire; (4) overhaul, when the firefighters remove furnishings, open walls, and pull ceilings to ensure that the fire is completely extinguished, and (5) termination, during which equipment is recovered, and hundreds of feet of 1.5 to 6 inch diameter hoselines are drained and re-packed onto the engines. While fighting structure fires remains a core function of fire departments, the number of responses to medical emergencies and hazardous materials incidents has more than doubled in the past 20 years. 3 Other dangerous aspects of the firefighter's job include responding to emergencies using warning lights and sirens through traffic, operating in poorly controlled environments such as motor vehicle accident or crime scenes, and operating in a wide array of technical rescue situations, including working in confined spaces, high elevations, extremes of temperature, and urban environments.",

Even without thermal stress from a fire, the clothing has been shown to significantly increase core body temperature during physical activity. 11 Typical noise exposures are of relatively short duration and high intensity, which may be different from the steady-state noise in many industrial environments. Amplified electronic or mechanical sirens are designed to be louder than background traffic noise, and are capable of sound pressure levels of 120 dB or more. The exposures to personnel riding in an ambulance or fire apparatus can exceed 100 dB. Since such exposures are short duration, the OSHA permissible exposure levels of 85 dBA may not be exceeded over an 8-hour time weighted average. [12] [13] [14] The high rate of hearing loss in firefighters, however, suggests that such short exposures may be intense enough to cause lasting damage. Pump operators, who stand next to the diesel engines that are maintained in high idle throughout incidents to power the apparatus' water delivery capability, may experience the highest overall noise exposure during a shift. A number of engineering controls have been used to reduce siren noise exposures, so that the noise exposure may vary by the type and locations of sirens used by a particular department. In addition, active noise cancellation hearing protective devices employing radio communication can reduce noise exposures due to predictable sources such as sirens, but to date are not widely in use.",

Inadequate attention was paid to ventilation of fire stations when diesel engines replaced horses early in the last century. Traditionally, living and sleeping accommodations for on-duty firefighters have been located above apparatus floors with open stairwells and pole passages providing direct conduits for exhaust fumes and gases generated by the trucks. High ambient diesel emissions levels in fire station living quarters have been documented 26 leading to efforts to design fire stations with better separation of living quarters from apparatus bays. Many departments have also installed emissions management systems in their apparatus garages to actively vent each vehicle's exhaust. Despite availability of such solutions, many personnel are still headquartered in old construction fire stations where diesel fumes and other environmental threats persist.",

An additional cause of apparatus accidents in the volunteer fire service involves tanker trucks. Water for firefighting must be shuttled to incident scenes in rural areas without fire hydrants by water tankers.

Individuals who remain actively employed as firefighters are also likely to be healthy enough to continue performing the physically demanding job duties. There is consequently a significant 'healthy worker effect' in cohorts of firefighters, and rates of illness would be expected to be lower than the general population due to this selection bias. Secondly, exposures to chemicals and particulates during firefighting operations should have decreased in recent decades due to the increased use of respiratory protection.

These factors alone or in combination could potentially unmask occult coronary artery disease not detected by standard cardiac stress testing. The sporadic nature of these occupational demands, however, is not sufficient to maintain either strength or aerobic fitness, and until recently little attention has been paid to the need for vigorous, ongoing, job-specific fitness programs. A study of body mass index in firefighters found that 87% were overweight, and the obesity was correlated with increased cholesterol and blood pressure. 37 While the ranks of career firefighters thin rapidly over age 50, largely due to job-related disability retirements, 32, 33 volunteer firefighters may remain active into their eighth decade, serving as fire police or otherwise assisting at emergency scenes. The data show that many of the fatal, lineof-duty heart attacks occur in these older, predominantly male volunteers.

Most of the potentially disqualifying conditions are readily recognized by medical providers, as they interfere with an individual's normal functioning, and it is clear that they could not routinely meet the physiologic demands of firefighting. The most common, problematic medical conditions confronted by fire department physicians include monocular vision, hearing deficits, diabetes mellitus, seizure disorders, and, of course, coronary artery disease. NFPA 1582 sets disqualification criteria for each of these conditions. The following brief discussion serves only to introduce some of the key issues related to these conditions. New monocular vision results in impaired depth perception and narrows visual fields. These are significant concerns on the fireground, as awareness of surrounding hazards, and ability to negotiate ladders, crawl along floor joists and work on roofs are all essential job tasks. With training following loss of vision in one eye, firefighters can compensate for their impaired depth perception, but the loss of peripheral vision should disqualify them from driving fire department apparatus during emergency responses.",

Firefighters engaged in an interior fire attack are typically notified of the need for immediate evacuation due to untenable conditions or impending structure collapse by the sounding of apparatus air horns. All of these critical sounds must be detected and understood by firefighters in an environment of high background noise.
