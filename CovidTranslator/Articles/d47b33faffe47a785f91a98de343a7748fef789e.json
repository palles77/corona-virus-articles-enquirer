            "text": "The genus Alphavirus contains members that threaten human health, both as natural pathogens and as potential biological weapons. Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMO) enter cells readily and can inhibit viral replication through sequence-specific steric blockade of viral RNA. Sindbis virus (SINV) has low pathogenicity in humans and is regularly utilized as a model alphavirus. PPMO targeting the 5\u2032-terminal and AUG translation start site regions of the SINV genome blocked the production of infectious SINV in tissue culture. PPMO designed against corresponding regions in Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) were likewise found to be effective in vitro against several strains of VEEV. Mice treated with PPMO before and after VEEV infection were completely protected from lethal outcome while mice receiving only post-infection PPMO treatment were partially protected. Levels of virus in tissue samples correlated with animal survival. Uninfected mice suffered no apparent ill-effects from PPMO treatment. Thus, PPMO appear promising as candidates for therapeutic development against alphaviruses.",

            "text": "The genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae consists of 28 viruses, most of which cycle between mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts. Several alphaviruses, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), O'nyong-nyong virus and Chikungunya virus, can cause severe disease in humans, that typically includes fever and neurological sequelae (Griffin, 2007) . Of these, VEEV is the most important human pathogen, with several recent outbreaks consisting of hundreds of thousands of cases occurring mostly in Latin America (Weaver et al., 2004) . Furthermore, EEEV, WEEV, and VEEV are considered bioterrorist threats because they cause severe disease in humans, can be produced in large quantity and/or are potentially transmitted by aerosol (Hawley and Eitzen, 2001; Sidwell and Smee, 2003) . Veterinary vaccines of varying quality against EEEV, WEEV, and VEEV are commercially available, but only IND preparations are approved for human use and their availability is limited to military and laboratory personnel. No therapeutic for alphavirus-induced disease exists, although supportive treatment and anti-inflammatory drugs may be beneficial. Recently short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been shown to be effective against the alphaviruses Semliki Forest virus (Caplen et al., 2002) and VEEV (O'Brien, 2006) , in cell cultures, and against O'nyong-nyong virus replication in its natural mosquito vector, Anopheles gambiae (Keene et al., 2004) .",

The negative-strand intermediate is used as template to produce both full-length positivestrand, and, using a 24 nucleotide internal promoter, a \u223c 4 kb subgenomic RNA is produced, which is identical in sequence to the 3\u2032 terminal third of the genomic RNA.

            "text": "Antisense oligomers of various structural types have been used to interfere with gene expression of several human viral pathogens (Schubert and Kurreck, 2006) , and a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide designed to target mRNA of cytomegalovirus (CMV) that is intended to treat CMV-induced retinitis is an approved drug (De Clercq, 2004) . However, antisense therapeutic technology continues to be hampered by limitations in both oligomer stability and delivery to RNA targets within relevant cells (Kurreck, 2003) . Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO) are a class of oligonucleotide-like antisense agents that possess the same four bases as DNA, but contain a different backbone. The deoxyribose ring and phosphodiester linkage of DNA are replaced by a morpholine ring and phosphorodiamidate linkage in PMO . PMO are nonionic, are stable in cellular extracts and human serum (Nelson et al., 2005; Youngblood et al., 2007) and typically are synthesized to a length of 20-25 subunits. The PMO mechanism of antisense action is via steric-blocking of complementary RNA sequence (Stein et al., 1997) , and thus differs from that of antisense agents based on DNA chemistry, which induce RNase H-mediated cleavage of the RNA strand of a RNA-DNA duplex, or RNAi/ siRNA involving double-stranded agents that recognize target mRNA and induce its degradation by cellular proteins (Masiero et al., 2007) . PMO covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) can be delivered efficiently into cells (Deas et al., 2005; Moulton et al., 2004; Yuan et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006) . CPP-PMO are water-soluble and have been shown to generate potent inhibition of several RNA viruses, including dengue virus (Holden et al., 2006; Kinney et al., 2005) , West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2005) , SARS Coronavirus (Neuman et al., 2005) , Equine Arterivirus (van den Born et al., 2005) and influenza virus (Ge et al., 2006) in cell culture, and Coxsackievirus B3 (Yuan et al., 2006) , Ebola virus (Enterlein et al., 2006) , murine Coronavirus (Burrer et al., 2007) and West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2007) both in cell culture and in mouse models. Two different CPP-conjugated PMO (PPMO), one containing oligoarginine (P3) and one containing 6-aminohexanoic acid (P7), have been utilized (Moulton et al., 2004; Abes et al., 2006) . A recent report documented that P7-conjugated PPMO are highly stable in human serum for at least 2 hours (h), and moderately stable for 24 h (Youngblood et al., 2007) .",

We found that two PPMO, one targeting the 5\u2032-terminal sequence and the other targeting the first functional AUG translation start site regions of the genome, were effective in blocking viral production. Subsequently, PPMO were designed to target the two corresponding regions in VEEV.

            "text": "Considerations in PPMO sequence design for this study included our current understanding of the function of various alphavirus genetic regions, and PPMO mechanism of action. As with other positive-strand viruses that utilize cap-dependent translation, access of trans-acting proteins to the 5\u2032 terminal region of the genome is critical to alphavirus capping reactions and the process of translation pre-initiation (Vasiljeva et al., 2000) . It has also been shown by mutational studies that certain sequence and secondary structure requirements in the 5\u2032 terminal region of the alphavirus genome must be present for efficient viral replication to occur (Frolov et al., 2001; Gorchakov et al., 2004; Niesters and Strauss, 1990; Tsiang et al., 1988) . The 3\u2032 terminal region of the antigenome has likewise been shown to play an integral role in positive-strand synthesis (Frolov et al., 2001) , perhaps through the presence of a stem-loop structure corresponding to the inverse of that present in the 5\u2032 end of the genome. Specific sequence requirements in the 19 nucleotide 3\u2032 conserved sequence element (3\u2032CSE) immediately preceding the polyA tail are necessary for efficient minus-strand synthesis (Frolov et al., 2001) . Another study reported high antiviral activity from PPMO targeting the 5\u2032 terminal region of the Equine Arterivirus genome, and moderate activity with PPMO targeting either the 3\u2032 terminus of the genome or 3\u2032 terminus of the antigenome (van den Born et al., 2005) , although the 5\u2032 end of the antigenome was not included as a target. Other groups have also reported high efficacy by PPMO targeting the genomic 5\u2032 terminal region of other positivestrand viruses, including dengue (Kinney et al., 2005) , West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2005) , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (Zhang et al., 2006) and murine Coronavirus (Burrer et al., 2007) . The above reports documenting the importance of sequence and structures in terminal regions of the alphavirus genome, along with the Table 1. success of termini-targeted PPMO, led us to design PPMO against each of the four termini of SINV genomic RNA (Fig. 1 ). Alphavirus subgenomic (sg) RNA encoding the structural proteins is synthesized by internal initiation on the genome-length negative-strand RNA. The minimal sequence essential for promoter activity extends from nucleotide \u221219 to +5 (in relation to the start codon of the sg positive-strand) and corresponds to the genomic positive-strand sequence from nucleotides 7579 to 7602 in SINV (Levis et al., 1990) . We therefore targeted this corepromoter region in the antigenome, in an effort to interfere with the synthesis of plus-strand sg RNA. The genomic 5\u2032-most AUG codon is required for translation initiation of the nonstructural proteins of alphaviruses (Lemm et al.,1994) . The region flanking the translation start site has been a favored target site for PMO mediated silencing of viral (Enterlein et al., 2006; Neuman et al., 2005; van den Born et al., 2005) and cellular (Heasman, 2002; Nasevicius and Ekker, 2000) mRNAs, and was an obvious PPMO target selection. Three of the six sites we initially chose to target with PPMO are regions of highly conserved sequence either between alphavirus species, or between strains within a species: (i) the CSE at the 3\u2032 terminus of the genome (ii) the sg core-promoter region and (iii) the 5\u2032 terminal region (Lemm et al., 1994) .

SinLuc virus was harvested following electroporation of BHK cells with in vitro transcribed SinLuc RNA. Prior to infection with SinLuc virus BHK cells were treated with SINV P3-PPMO in the concentration range that was demonstrated to be non-cytotoxic in the cell viability experiment (shown in Fig. 2A ). For quantitative comparison, statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the luc levels for all groups (PPMO or untreated control at all concentrations via two way ANOVA, \u03b1 = 0.05) as well as pairwise comparison of luc levels for SINV PPMO treatments or untreated (\"No PPMO\") at each concentration to the corresponding Scr treatment (Bonferroni's post-test, \u03b1 = 0.05). Dose-responsive inhibition of SINV replication, as represented by luc readings, was observed for both the SINV 5\u2032+ PPMO (Fig. 3A , right panel) and SINV AUG PPMO (3A, left panel). For the SINV AUG PPMO, at 5, 7.5 and 10 \u03bcM this reduction was in the range of 70-90% relative to Scr and was statistically significant (p-values b 0.01). For the SINV 5\u2032+, a reduction of 85-100% with the dose tested in the range of 0.5-10 \u03bcM was significant (pvalues b 0.001). In contrast, the level of inhibition produced by the SINV 5\u2032-, 3\u2032+ and 3\u2032-PPMO was similar at all concentrations, and these levels were significantly different from Scr PPMO (p-values b 0.01); however, this reduction (%) did not appear to be dose dependent. For the SgP, no significant differences were detected at the majority of the concentrations tested, with the exception of 0.1 and 7.5 \u03bcM. However, at 0.1 \u03bcM, for all groups (PPMO or untreated controls), the luc values were generally higher relative to Scr, but were not statistically different from Scr (p-values N 0.05). Thus, significant dose-responsive inhibition was observed for the SINV 5\u2032+ and SINV AUG PPMO.",

At 8 (left panel) or 24 hpi (right panel), the supernatant was harvested for analysis of viral titer via plaque assay. At both time points, viral titers of the VEEV 5+ or VEEV AUG-treated cultures were below the limit of detection (0.6 log 10 PFU/ml) for all VEEV strains. In contrast, for the VSV control, viral production was relatively unaffected by PPMO treatment; VSV levels were in the range of 2-3 log 10 /ml and 5-8 log 10 PFU/ml at 8 and 24 hpi, respectively. The relative virus production for the different VEEV strains was similar at both time points, however, the titers at 24 h were \u223c5 log 10 higher. These experiments indicate that the VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO was effective at reducing the virus production at 8 and 24 hpi for multiple strains of VEEV, despite a moderate level of non-specific activity. Dose-response experiments with TC83 were subsequently performed at the same moi and incubation time, but including additional sampling time points and concentrations using the VEEV 5\u2032+ P7-PPMO conjugated to the fluorescent label, AMCA (Fig. 4B) , or as control, the P7-AMCAconjugated Scr. At the lower doses of 0.5 and 1.0 \u03bcM, no significant reduction in viral titer was detected for the 5\u2032+ PPMO-treated cells in comparison to Scr.

Compared to mock-treated mice, the average liver titers in the mice receiving \u2212pre/+post VEEV 5\u2032+ PPMO following infection was about 1 log 10 higher at 2 dpi, and about 2 log 10 less at 3 and 4 dpi, (Fig. 5B, panel iii) . Spleen titers in the group receiving VEEV 5\u2032+ treatment following infection were similar to Luciferase (Luc) levels were measured in triplicate, as described in Materials and methods. The average and standard deviation are shown. Statistical analysis of luciferase levels of SINV PPMO vs. Scr treatment (two-way ANOVA, \u03b1 = 0.05; pairwise comparison via Bonferroni post-test) was performed and results are described in the text. B) Dose-response inhibition of wild type SINV. Panel i-ii) Effect of SINV PPMO on SINV production. BHK cells were infected with SINV at an moi of \u223c 0.03 and treated at 1 hpi with the indicated PPMO (1 or 5 \u03bcM, panels i and ii, respectively). At 24 hpi, the virus levels in supernatant samples were determined by plaque assay. Supernatants were analyzed in quadruplicate (1 \u03bcM) or triplicate (5 \u03bcM). The results of one representative experiment out of two performed is shown. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (\u03b1 = 0.05) with Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test in pairwise comparison of each PPMO-treated group relative to the mock control. Statistically significant differences in Dunnett's test are indicated by an asterisk (\u204ep-value b 0.01) and the percent reduction is shown. Panel iii) Effect of SINV PPMO on two control viruses, VSV and TC83. Vero cells were infected with VSV or VEEV (TC83) at an moi of 0.1 and treated at 1 hpi with the indicated PPMO at 5 \u03bcM. At 8 and 24 h, the virus production levels were determined by plaque assay. Viral titration of untreated, infected Vero cells (\"No PPMO\") was also performed. The result of a single experiment is shown. C) Inhibition of viral protein expression by SINV-specific PPMO. BHK cells were treated with the indicated PPMO starting at 1 h after infection with SINV (moi of 0.03). At 24 hpi the cells were incubated with 35 S-methionine for 1 h, and cell lysates then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The molecular weight marker is shown. Viral capsid (C) and envelope protein (E1) and apparent molecular mass are indicated by the arrows. The percentage of C expression, relative to the mock-treated control, as determined by densitometry, is shown numerically under the lanes. D) Inhibition of viral translation by SINV-specific PPMO. In vitro transcribed SINV RNA was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of a molar excess of the indicated PPMO as described in Materials and methods. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by phosphor imager. mock-treated mice at 2 dpi, somewhat lower than mock at 3 dpi, and considerably lower (undetectable) than mock at 4 dpi (Fig. 5B , panel iv). Lung titers were similarly low for mice treated \u2212pre/+post VEEV with 5\u2032+ and mock-treated mice at 2 and 3 dpi, while at 4 dpi, mocktreated mice had an average titer of \u223c4 log 10 while both PPMO treatment groups had undetectable titers (Fig. 5B, panel v) .",

The antiviral efficacy of PPMO targeted to various locations in the 5\u2032 end of the genome of positive-strand RNA viruses has been observed for Nidoviruses (Neuman et al., 2005; van den Born et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006) , Flaviviruses (Deas et al., 2005; Kinney et al., 2005) , and Picornaviruses (Vagnozzi et al., 2007; Yuan et al., 2006) . It remains undetermined why four of the six SINV PPMO in this study were relatively ineffective. Future studies may evaluate other regions of alphavirus sequence as prospective PPMO targets, including the 5\u2032 terminal-and AUG-regions of the subgenomic RNA. Results from cell culture (Fig. 3C ) and in cell-free translation assays (Fig. 3D) indicate that both active PPMO identified in this study can directly interfere with viral translation. The lack of activity by several PPMO incidentally provides confirmation of the specificity of the inhibitory action of the effective PPMO. In addition, these experiments did not reveal any non-specific toxicity associated with PPMO chemistry, which would be reflected in overall lowered luciferase (Fig. 3A) , plaque (Fig. 3B) , or viral protein production (Fig. 3C ) in comparison with untreated or Scr controls. Further evidence of the lack of toxicity of this compound is provided by cell viability assays for all PPMO used (Fig. 2) , the relatively low inhibitory activity of VEEV-specific PPMO against VSV (Fig. 4A) , the control (Scr) PPMO employed throughout this study, and the uncompromised health of PPMO-treated (uninfected) mice (Fig. 5A ).",

BHK cells at 80% confluency were incubated with the indicated PPMO in the range of 0.1-20 \u03bcM for 24 h. The production of formazan relative to mock-treated cells was used to assess PPMO toxicity. For the P7-and P7-AMCA-conjugated VEEV-specific (VEEV 5\u2032+ or VEEV AUG) and the control (Scr) PPMO, viability assay measuring the conversion of resazurin to resorufin was performed using CellTiter-Blue\u00ae Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, Vero cells were incubated with PPMO concentrations in the range of 0-7.5 \u03bcM for 1 h, after which the incubation media was removed and cells incubated for various time periods (0, 4, 10, 20, 24, 36 and 48 h).

In vitro translation reactions were performed using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), as described by the supplier. Lysates were programmed with 125 ng RNA/10 \u03bcl lysate and were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by phosphor imager. Statistical analysis of the average luciferase levels obtained from triplicate measurement was performed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, \u03b1 = 0.05) with pairwise comparison of each SINV PPMO with Scr using Bonferroni's post-test using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego California USA).

To further evaluate potential non-specific effects of the SINV PPMO, experiments were performed using Vero cells infected with VSV or VEEV (TC-83) at an moi of 0.1 and then treated with the SINV 5\u2032+, SINV AUG or Scr PPMO at 1 h post-infection (+1 h).

Asterisk (\u204e) indicates that no virus was detected for any sample in that group. The result of a single experiment is shown. B) PPMO dose-response inhibition of VEEV. Vero cells were infected at a moi of 0.1 with VEEV (TC-83 strain) for 1 h prior to the addition of the indicated P7-AMCA-conjugated PPMO at doses in the range of 0.5 to 10 \u03bcM. At various time points post-infection (indicated in graph), supernatants were harvested for analysis of viral titer via plaque assay. The result of a single experiment is shown. C) Effect of VEEV PPMO on VEEV and on the control virus, VSV (eight replicates). Vero cells were infected at a moi of 0.1 with VEEV (TC-83 strain), or as a control, with VSV, for 1 h prior to the addition of the indicated P7-AMCA-conjugated PPMO at 5 \u03bcM. Supernatants were harvested at 8 and 24 hpi for analysis of viral titer via plaque assay, performed in eight replicates at each time point for VEEV or VSV. Statistical analysis was performed on log 10 -transformed viral titer values comparing all treatments using one-way analysis of variance (\u03b1 = 0.05, GraphPad Prism). Pairwise comparison of the log 10 -titer values by treatment group was performed using Bonferroni post-test. Bars with asterisk indicate a statistically significant difference (Bonferroni, p-value b 0.001). The average percent change was calculated from log 10 titers as: 100 \u204e (VEEV PPMO-average control) \u00f7 average control. A summary table showing the average percent change, relative to either the untreated (\"No PPMO\") or Scr controls is shown. D) Effect of combined VEEV 5\u2032+ and VEEV AUG PPMO on VEEV. Vero cells were infected at a moi of 0.1 with VEEV (TC-83 strain), or as a control, with VSV, for 1 h prior to the addition of the indicated P7-AMCA-conjugated PPMO at 7.5 and 10 \u03bcM (each PPMO). Supernatants were harvested at 8 and 24 hpi (and for VSV, at 8, 24, and 48 hpi) for analysis of viral titer via plaque assay. The result of a single experiment is shown.",
