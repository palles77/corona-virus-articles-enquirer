Occupational and sports medicine research has attempted to determine a non-invasive proxy for core temperature particularly when access to participants is limited and thermal safety is of a concern due to protective encapsulating clothing, hot ambient environments and/or high endogenous heat production during athletic competition. This investigation aimed to determine the validity of inner canthus of the eye temperature (T EC ) as an alternate non-invasive measure of intestinal core temperature (T C ) during rest, exercise and post-exercise conditions. Twelve physically active males rested for 30 min prior to exercise, performed 60 min of aerobic exercise at 60% V\u0307O 2max and passively recovered a further 60 min post-exercise. T EC and T C were measured at 5 min intervals during each condition. Mean differences between T EC and T C were 0.61\u00b0C during pre-exercise, \u22121.78\u00b0C during exercise and \u22121.00\u00b0C during post-exercise. The reliability between the methods was low in the pre-exercise (ICC=0.49 [\u22120.09 to 0.82]), exercise (ICC=\u22120.14 [\u22120.65 to 0.44]) and postexercise (ICC=\u22120.25 [\u22120.70 to 0.35]) conditions. In conclusion, poor agreement was observed between the T EC values measured through IRT and T C measured through a gastrointestinal telemetry pill. Therefore, T EC is not a valid substitute measurement to gastrointestinal telemetry pill in sports and exercise science settings.",

Small T C increases result in specific physiological responses such as increased cutaneous vasodilation and sweating, which helps to dissipate excess body heat during exercise (Romanovsky, 2014; Sawka et al., 2011) . Research into obtaining a fast, valid, reliable and noninvasive measure of core temperature is of interest in many disciplinary fields. For example, during the 2009 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) generated by Influenza A (H1N1) in Southeast Asia, thermal images obtained through infrared thermography (IRT) were successfully used for screening potential infected individuals at international airports, becoming an important primary step for mass prevention of the spread of SARS (Chan et al., 2004; Lahiri et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2004; Ring and Ammer, 2012; Teunissen and Daanen, 2011) . Furthermore, occupational and sports medicine research has attempted to determine a non-invasive proxy for core temperature particularly when access to participants is limited and thermal safety is of a concern due to protective encapsulating clothing (Montain et al., 1994) , hot ambient environments (Taylor, 2006) and/or high endogenous heat production during athletic competition (Laursen et al., 2006) .",

Unfortunately, some of these investigations failed to apply sufficient standardization of IRT (Bourlai et al., 2012) or employed core temperature measures prone to bias from ambient conditions or patient morphology (Daanen, 2006) such as tympanic (Ng et al., 2004) or oral temperature (Chan et al., 2004) . Recent work by Teunissen and Daanen (2011) has identified the inner canthus of the eye (T EC ) as a potential site in which core temperature could be derived in the exercising individual. Using esophageal temperature as a comparison, the T EC was shown to have large mean bias (1.80+0.89\u00b0C) and variability across a number of conditions including rest, exercise, recovery and passive heating. However Teunissen and Daanen (2011) analyzed both sex and did not describe the procedures for extracting and analyzing the data, which can lead an error, given number of factors that may influence infrared thermography (Fern\u00e1ndez-Cuevas et al., 2015) . Moreover, although esophageal temperature has been reported as a measure that responds quicker than other techniques to changes in T C it can be influenced by swallowing saliva or beverages (Taylor et al., 2014) . Additionally, insertion of a probe in the lower third of the esophagus is necessary (Mekjavic and Rempel, 1990) , which may cause vomiting, respiratory tract or throat irritation and additionally is difficult to implement in real world applications such as field-based outdoor measurement (Domitrovich et al., 2010; Easton et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2000) .",

Thus, the T C measured in the esophagus, rectum and bowel are the most widely used techniques in scientific studies, being considered less-invasive, valid, reliable and reproducible (Domitrovich et al., 2010; Easton et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2000) . Rectal temperature is often used by research groups due to the stability of the measure even in the presence of fluid intake or different humidity and room temperatures (Domitrovich et al., 2010; Easton et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2000) . However, it requires a wired connection between the temperature sensor and the recorder that makes difficult to collect the data in real conditions, as well as the associated social stigma accompanying the insertion of a sensor approximately 10 cm past the anal sphincter (Domitrovich et al., 2010; Easton et al., 2007) . Intestinal temperature measured by an ingested telemetry pill requires no wires, allowing data collection outdoors, but it has high financial cost and ingested pills can be used only once (Domitrovich et al., 2010; Easton et al., 2007; Fernandes et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2000) . Intestinal telemetry pills have been validated against rectal (Byrne and Lim, 2007; Teunissen and Daanen, 2011) and esophageal temperature (Byrne and Lim, 2007) when influencing factors such as calibration and timing of ingestion are controlled for.",

Indeed, improvements in the accuracy, functionality and affordability of camera technology have seen IRT become a widely adopted method of temperature measurement in exercise and sports science (Costello et al., 2012) . It is important that researchers and clinicians are aware of the potential applications and limitations of IRT provides. Thus, the validation of this technique as a simple non-invasive method of T C measurement could represent an advance for the field of exercise physiology, as researchers may have an interesting alternative to measure T C . Therefore, the objective of this study was to verify the validity of the T EC measured by IRT as a T C indicator under resting, exercise and post-exercise in temperate conditions.",

Considering the assumptions required (dependence of observations, normality of sampling distribution, and uniformity of residuals) (Hopkins, 1997) , a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was performed between T EC and T C data. For comparing the difference between methods in each moment, Bonferroni post hoc test was applied. The sphericity was assumed in all calculations. The limits of agreement between pairs of measurements of T EC compared with T C were searched according to the method suggested by Bland and Altman (1986) . For reliability of the pairs of values obtained, the Intraclass Correlation Coeficient (ICC) one-way random was used. In this setting, the ICC is the proportion of the total variance that can be ascribed to true differences. Values for the ICC range from 0 to 1. In addition, typical error of the measure which is the standard deviation of the individual values and its range were also calculated. The use of these approaches follows the recommendations of (Atkinson and Nevill, 1998) because there are advantages and disadvantages to each case. Analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel\u00ae (Microsoft, Redmond, USA) and IBM SPSS (Version 21.0, Chicago, USA). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

It should be considered that under conditions of fever the T EC could be higher and closer to the T C and this fact could explain why our results differ from those of the aforementioned investigations. On the other hand, Teunissen and Daanen (2011) compared the T EC to esophageal temperature of 10 subjects in four conditions (rest, exercise, recovery and passive heating) concluding that the measure obtained as T EC was not as reliable as the obtained for T C , pointing out an agreement with the findings of our study.",

            "text": "The statistical analysis of the data after exercise also indicates a low agreement between T EC and the T C , which is worst than at rest, showing average error of \u22121.00\u00b0C (range between \u22120.29\u00b0C and \u22122.29; 95% CI) (Fig. 3c) . At the moment P30, the difference between methods was 1.0\u00b0C [T EC (36.4\u00b0C) and T C (37.4\u00b0C). In the study of Teunissen and Daanen (2011) the T EC values obtained by IRT were inconsistent with the T C values during rest. We should also consider a point in order to understand the divergence on the evolution of the T EC and T C during exercise (i.e., while the T C increase in a uniform way, the T EC decrease with higher variability). On the other hand, the present research differs from Cholewka et al. (2016) which studied twelve male cyclists during a incremental test and found a constant increase of T EC as the exercise intensity increased. However, this difference can be explained mainly because of exercise type, since the present study the participants performed continuous exercise fixed to 60% of the V\u0307O2max speed, while the study of Cholewka et al. (2016) carried out an incremental test increasing the intensity every 3 min until maximal effort. Thus, it is suggested that T EC has a different response in continuous and incremental exercise. Indeed, sweat could potentially affect the T EC results because, given that sweat level depends on exercise intensity (Machado-Moreira et al., 2008) , the sweat accumulated on the forehead during exercise is not blocked between the eyebrows and it may precipitate as beads of sweat on both sides of the nose cooling the area of inner canthus of the eye and influence IRT measurements (Bach et al., 2015; Bernard et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "In this sense, it seems that T EC, as recorded in our study, it is not a measure that can replace the traditional methods used in studies of thermoregulation to measure T C during exercise. It is important to note that there are several methods for T C measurement in humans during resting or exercise conditions and each of the various forms of T C measurement have their own inherent limitations (Domitrovich et al., 2010) . Although ingestible telemetry pill have been shown to be valid and reliable alternative to rectal T C (Byrne and Lim, 2007; Ganio et al., 2009), evidence suggests that telemetry pills consistently overestimate T C by > 0.1\u00b0C compared to rectal thermometers (Byrne and Lim, 2007) . As a result, it is plausible to suggest that differences observed between T EC and T C seen in this study would be lower and therefore more agreeable if T C were measured by rectal thermometer. However, it is unclear whether rectal T C would provide sufficient agreement to T EC . This investigation attempted to control for individual rates of gastrointestinal motility that prevent a fixed anatomical position to measure intestinal T C by instructing participants to ingest the pill at least 6 h prior to data collection to allow for the pill to pass through the stomach into the intestines (Byrne and Lim, 2007; Domitrovich et al., 2010) . Furthermore, we instructed our participants to maintain typical meal intake in the 24 h preceding testing to minimize changes to normal gastrointestinal motility. However, the gastrointestinal motility may be influenced by many factors including diurnal variation (Goodman et al., 2009) , exercise (Leiper et al., 2005) , age (Madsen and Graff, 2004) , among others (Koffler et al., 1992) . Thus, intestinal pill position at the time of measurement could not be guaranteed, consequently this variation may contribute to differences observed in this study. Interpretation of this data is subject to certain limitations including the relatively moderate exercise intensity performed in intervals to allow for data collection. Future studies should build upon the findings of the current investigation by assessing continuous exercise at higher intensities. Furthermore, the study population was limited to healthy young adult men, and the thermal response may be different for other age groups, unhealthy populations and women. Another limitation of the current study was the small sample which leads a low statistical power. Future research should also implement the use of other commonly used T C measures such as rectal and esophageal temperature. Finally, it may be of interest to determine if of prevention sweat pooling around the eye would yield similar findings to the current investigation.",
