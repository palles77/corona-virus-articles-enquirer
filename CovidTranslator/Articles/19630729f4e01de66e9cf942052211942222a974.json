Enhanced macrophage tropism and the resulting induction of pyogranulomatous lesions are shared with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infection in cats, but are not features of ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) infection. Comparative sequence analysis of the distal one-third of the genomes of one FRSCV and one FRECV strain showed that these two ferret coronaviruses share >96% nucleotide sequence identities in the membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and non-structural protein genes (partial polymerase, open reading frames [ORFs] 3 and 7b). The envelope (E) protein gene showed a moderate nucleotide sequence similarity of 91.6%. In contrast, nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities observed with the spike (S) protein were only 79.5 and 79.6%, respectively. Twenty-one amino acid differences within a 195-199-amino acid C-terminal portion of the S protein were conserved between 3 strains each of FRSCV and FRECV. Both systemic and enteric strains were found to carry a single ORF 3 gene with truncated proteins observed in two out of three FRSCV strains examined. The two enteric strains analyzed each contained an intact ORF 3 gene. Phylogenetically, FRSCV is more closely related to FRECV than to other group 1 coronaviruses.",

Clinical findings commonly observed in the FIP-like disease in ferrets include anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea and the presence of large palpable intra-abdominal masses. Strikingly similar to FIP is the presence of widespread granulomas on serosal surfaces and within the parenchyma of the abdominal and thoracic organs. Histopathologic examination shows a systemic pyogranulomatous inflammation involving the mesenteric adipose tissue, lymph nodes, liver, lungs, kidney, spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands. Moreover, the immunohistochemical detection of coronavirus antigen in the cytoplasm of intra-lesional macrophages is consistent with what has been observed in tissues of cats with FIP.",

A unique 599-bp partial spike sequence of the ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) was derived and analyzed. This sequence was found to be more similar (77% deduced amino acid sequence similarity) to the previously described (Wise et al., 2006) ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) than to other group 1 coronaviruses, feline coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine and canine coronavirus (CCV) (71-73% deduced 0168-1702/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2009.12.011 amino acid sequence similarities). FRECV is associated with a different disease in ferrets, epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE) (Williams et al., 2000) . ECE is a highly contagious diarrheal disease of ferrets associated with a mortality rate of <5%. When first recognized, the disease was more severe in older ferrets but often mild and subclinical in juveniles. We previously characterized FRECV, and found it to be a novel group 1 coronavirus (Wise et al., 2006) , based upon analyses of partial sequences of the polymerase (pol), spike (S) and membrane (M) protein genes and the complete sequence of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. This study is the first report on the genetic relationship between one systemic (FRSCV MSU-1) and one enteric (FRECV MSU-2) ferret coronavirus strain, based upon a comparative analysis of their 3 -most 8.3-8.6 kb genomic sequences.",

Partial sequence was also derived from the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of the genome. The genomic organization observed for each virus was consistent with that of a typical coronavirus. Each intact gene was preceded, a few nucleotides upstream its 5 end, by the recognized consensus transcription-regulating sequence (TRS), 5 -CTAAAC-3 , of coronaviruses (Budzilowicz et al., 1985; Horsburgh et al., 1992; Kapke and Brian, 1986; Snijder et al., 2003; Spaan et al., 1988) .

The highly conserved 10-base sequence, 5 -GGGAAGAGCT-3 , found in the 3 UTR of all coronaviruses, was also noted, both in FRSCV and FRECV. Reminiscent of the observation made for FRECV MSU-1 (Wise et al., 2006) , the 10-base sequence was found 170 bases downstream ORF 7b and had the same 2 base mismatches, a T instead of a G in the first base, and a G instead of an A at the seventh base.",

Among the nsp genes identified, a single open reading frame, ORF 3, between the S and E genes was found for both viruses. BLAST analysis of the putative ORF 3 protein showed highest significant similarities (56-59%) to nsp 3c of CCV and FCoV, and to the 3c homologue, nsp 3b of TGEV. Two more putative nsp genes observed were the two coronavirus ORF 7-like genes downstream of the N gene, namely, 3x-like and 7b, as previously observed in the FRECV MSU-1 strain (Wise et al., 2006) . However, FRSCV MSU-1 only contained a 45-bp remnant of the 3x-like ORF because of a 113-bp deletion, 33 bases downstream of the start codon, resulting to a frameshift that prematurely ends the ORF. FRECV MSU-2 shared very high sequence similarities to previously reported partial S and M, full N, 3x-like and 7b protein sequences of FRECV MSU-1 (96.4-100%).

The partial S sequences of two other systemic strains, FRSCV MSU-S and FRSCV WADL, and one other enteric strain, FRECV 1202, were determined by consensus S gene RT-PCR. Their deduced amino acid sequences were aligned with corresponding sequences of FRSCV MSU-1, FRECV MSU-2 and FRECV MSU-1 (Fig. 1) . The partial sequence being analyzed corresponds to residues 1195-1393 of the FRSCV MSU-1 S protein in Fig. 3 . The alignment in Fig. 1 shows that 21 amino acid substitutions observed between the systemic and enteric viruses were conserved within a virus pathotype. Moreover, the same four residue deletion was consistently observed in each of the three FRECV strains examined in comparison to the three strains of FRSCV. The systemic strains shared an average identity of 94.3% with each other. The average similarity shared between two enteric strains was 92.3%. Average similarity of the partial spike sequences between the two pathotypes was only 80.1%.",

            "text": "Ferret systemic coronavirus causes signs and lesions that are similar to those induced by FIPV in cats. The partial S protein sequence we initially derived from a FRSCV strain (Garner et al., 2008) , was the first indicator that this virus appeared to be more similar to ferret enteric coronavirus than to any other group 1 coronavirus. The question then arose as to whether FRSCV strains could have evolved from FRECV by in vivo mutation, leading to the acquisition of a systemic virulent pathotype. The analogous situation in cats is enteric feline coronavirus infection, which causes a mild or asymptomatic localized enteric infection (Pedersen, 2009; Evermann et al., 1991; Rottier, 1999; Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005; Addie et al., 2004) and the systemic highly fatal disease FIP, considered to be derived by spontaneous mutation during FCoV persistence (Evermann et al., 1991; Rottier, 1999; Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005; Addie et al., 2004; De Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005; Poland et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998; Herrewegh et al., 1995; Rottier et al., 2005; Lai et al., 2007; Pedersen, 2009; Chang et al., 2009) . The mutation from FCoV to FIPV is accompanied by a marked acquisition of macrophage tropism (Pedersen, 1987; Stoddart and Scott, 1989) , which facilitates systemic spread (Rottier et al., 2005; Lai et al., 2007; Pedersen, 1987) . The precise nature of this phenomenon is not entirely understood (Lai et al., 2007) . In fact, enteric FCoVs and their counterpart FIPVs were observed to be geneti-cally very similar (Poland et al., 1996; Herrewegh et al., 1995; Vennema et al., 1998) , bearing only minor but crucial differences (Pedersen, 2009) . Candidate genes speculated to play a role in the virulence shift include the S and group-specific genes 3abc, 7b and 7a (Haijema et al., 2004; Vennema et al., 1998; Kennedy et al., 2001) . Using targeted RNA recombination, Rottier et al. (2005) have shown that the C-terminal 582-amino acid region of the FIPV 79-1146 S protein contains the amino acid changes that determine macrophage tropism. In this region of the S protein, a total of only 10 amino acid differences were noted between FIPV 79 and 1146 and its close relative, enteric strain FCoV 79-1683. A \"D-to-A\" substitution, upstream of the putative fusion peptide, was speculated to play a role in the transition of FCoV to FIPV. Pedersen (2009) , in a comprehensive review of FIPV infection, states that mutation in the 3c gene is responsible for the FIP biotype. Similarly, Chang et al. (2009) analyzed the 3c gene in 27 feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)-and 28 FIPV-infected cats and found that the 3c gene was mutated in the majority (71.4%) of the cats with FIP.",

            "text": "With the currently available data, it is still difficult to predict whether the systemic ferret coronavirus, FRSCV, is derived from its enteric counterpart, FRECV, by in vivo mutation, or is a cocirculating distinct strain. To resolve this, a significant number of additional strains from the same or different locations will have to be examined. It is also not clear at this point whether FRSCV originated as a result of a recombination between FRECV and another group 1 coronavirus, resulting in the acquisition of a very distinct S gene. A 3 -5 scanning of the nucleotide sequence alignment for the two virus strains did not show an abrupt discontinuity in identity at the 3 end of the S gene that would have been an indication of recombination. We noticed instead an increase in sequence divergence starting at the 200 bases adjacent to the 3 end of the S gene, within the ORF 3 gene region (nucleotide positions 1-200 in Fig. 4) , that gave a sequence similarity of only 75.5%. This of course does not discount the possibility that a recombination event may have involved the proximal portion of the ORF 3 gene region as well. BLAST analysis of the S sequence of FRSCV MSU-1 against reported sequences only showed FRECV MSU-1, the previously described enteric ferret coronavirus strain (Wise et al., 2006) , as the one with the most significant similarity to it. If recombination in the S gene did occur, giving rise to FRSCV, the donor coronavirus strain is yet to be discovered. An example of this phenomenon is type II FCoV, which originated from a double recombination between FCoV type I and canine coronavirus (CCV) (Motokawa et al., 1996; Herrewegh et al., 1998) .",

Whether this difference is associated with pathotype is not clear. In vivo experiments would be an obvious way to resolve this issue, but are hampered by the difficulty of growing either virus in cell culture. Another observation was that the partial S gene sequences from at least 3 different FRSCV strains, collected from different locales, were distinct from 3 different FRECV strains that also originated from different places (Fig. 1) . Whether this pattern would hold up with a larger sample size remains to be determined. The two genotype-specific RT-PCR assays developed in this study would certainly be useful molecular tools to expand the current data.",

According to Pedersen (2009) , mutation in the ORF 3c gene is responsible for the FIPV biotype and that FCoVs of the enteric biotype possess an intact 3c gene. It is thought that a loss of 3c gene function enhances the internalization and replication of FIPVs in macrophages (Dewerchin et al., 2005) . Pedersen (2009) explains that the mutations could either be SNPs which lead to premature stop codons or deletion mutations that significantly truncate the 3c gene product. In agreement to this are the findings of Chang et al. (2009) where mutations in the 3c gene were found in a majority (71.4%), of FIPV strains examined, while the gene was intact in 100% of analyzed FECVs. This lead to the conclusion that mutation in 3c cannot be the sole cause of FIP. In the ferret strains we analyzed, both systemic and enteric biotypes possess a single ORF 3 protein. The 3c-like protein in FRSCV MSU-1 was significantly truncated in comparison to FRECV MSU-2, prompting us to explore other systemic and enteric strains. Our findings show that the ferret coronaviruses have high sequence variability in ORF 3, even among strains of the same pathotype. A deletion in the 3c-like gene, giving rise to a truncated protein, was noted in two out of three systemic strains examined, while an intact ORF 3 was noted in the two enteric strains analyzed. Again, with the limited number of strains studied so far, it is not clear whether the mutation in gene 3 plays a role in the systemic nature of FRSCVs.",

We provide molecular evidence showing that systemic strain, FRSCV MSU-1, is more closely related to enteric strain, FRECV MSU-2, than to any other group 1 coronavirus, in all structural and nsp genes examined. One important observation was that these two virus strains differed significantly in the S gene. It is conceivable that FRSCV and FRECV are genetically distinctive coronaviruses of ferrets, a hypothesis already supported by Brown et al. (2009) in the case of FCoVs. On the other hand, it is also possible that the in vivo mutation theory of Chang et al. (2009) and Pedersen (2009) applies to the ferret coronaviruses. Analysis of more strains of each virus pathotype is certainly needed to either substantiate or modify either of these two concepts.",
