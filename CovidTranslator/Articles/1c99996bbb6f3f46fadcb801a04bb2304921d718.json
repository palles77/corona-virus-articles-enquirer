The majority of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in women of reproductive age are also transmitted sexually; however, there are other maternal infections that are not easily classifiable. Group B streptococcus, hepatitis B virus, cytomegalovirus, and the organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis, such as the mycoplasmas, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, and Mobiluncus species, are all found more commonly in sexually active women than non-sexually active women, but their mode of transmission is often not apparent. Other maternal infections that are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including malaria, parvovirus, rubella, and listeria, are not generally transmitted sexually.",

A liveborn infant is generally defined as an infant born at any gestational age having a heartbeat or respiratory effort. Death of a liveborn infant can occur in the neonatal period (in the first 28 days of life) or in the post neonatal period (between 28 days and 1 year of age). An infant death is defined as the death of a liveborn baby that occurs before 1 year of age, both neonatal and post-neonatal deaths. Perinatal mortality is frequently defined as the sum of fetal and neonatal deaths, although other definitions are used. Preterm birth is defined as a birth occurring before 37 weeks of gestation, and a growth-restricted infant is defined as one born at less than the 10th percentile birth weight for a specific gestational age. There are many definitions of long-term morbidity, but those children who have structural anomalies, blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy, or mental retardation are frequently defined as handicapped.",

Over time, evidence has accumulated in support of the causal role of intrauterine infection in various adverse pregnancy outcomes. As a result, growing attention has been focused on the optimal criteria for diagnosing intrauterine infection. Obviously, finding organisms in one of the above locations, before possible contamination from the vagina after membrane rupture, conclusively proves colonization (but not necessarily an adverse outcome associated with that colonization); however, many of the early studies, and in fact many studies reported recently, do not use a positive culture or even a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bacterial or viral DNA as the standard for diagnosing intrauterine infection. Instead, histologic chorioamnionitis or white cell infiltration into the chorion and amnion is often used as the criterion for diagnosing an intrauterine infection. Furthermore, in recent years there have been many investigations in which various markers of intrauterine infection-including elevations in various cytokines such as interleukin(IL)-6, IL-1b, and IL-8, increases in some of the matrix metalloproteinases, and the presence of white cells in the amniotic fluidhave been used as surrogate markers for an intrauterine infection [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Although finding bacteria in the amniotic fluid or in the membranes must be considered the most important indicator of any intrauterine bacterial infection, in women in preterm labor, the correlations between bacteria in the membranes, histologic chorioamnionitis, and elevated cytokines are all reasonably strong [5] .",

Some women who have an intrauterine bacterial infection develop clinical signs of a systemic infection, including fever, uterine tenderness, and an elevated white cell response. These women are labeled as having clinical chorioamnionitis; however, it is now clear that many women can have an intrauterine infection without having these clinical symptoms. For example, several studies suggest that only 5% to 10% of the women who have histologic chorioamnionitis or women who have organisms in the membranes have clinical chorioamnionitis [11] . Therefore, many investigators studying this issue now believe that intrauterine infection rarely presents as clinical chorioamnionitis. Instead, uterine contractions or preterm labor, or pre-term rupture of the membranes, appear to be far more common presentations of intrauterine infection. Furthermore, it is likely that many women who have an intrauterine infection will have no signs or symptoms at all.",

Using the standard obstetric definition, which includes a missed period and a positive urinary pregnancy test between 4 weeks and 6 weeks after the last menstrual period, approximately 15% to 20% of all pregnancies end in spontaneous miscarriage. The etiology of these miscarriages is generally secondary to maldevelopment of the ovum and associated chromosomal abnormalities. It is very rare to spontaneously abort a normally developing fetus during the first trimester. In fact, most of the pathologic material from spontaneous abortions fails to demonstrate any fetal tissue whatsoever. In some reports, maternal infections such as syphilis, rubella, and HIV have been associated with early spontaneous abortion; however, there is little evidence that these infections play an important role in first trimester spontaneous abortion [12] .",

Spontaneous second trimester abortions occur in approximately 1% to 2% of all pregnancies. Although the etiology of these losses is often less clear than that of those occurring at other times, second trimester losses certainly include anomalous fetuses, some having chromosomal abnormalities, and those losses which occur secondary to uterine malformations, incompetent cervix and leiomyomata [12] . Most of the spontaneous second trimester losses, however, occur in the face of a normal uterus and a normally developed fetus. In these cases, there is either ''spontaneous'' labor or rupture of membranes leading to delivery, or a fetal death that ultimately leads to delivery. Obstetric complications such as twin pregnancy, placental abruption, the presence of maternal anticardiolipin antibodies, or the lupus anticoagulant and fetal growth retardation are also associated with spontaneous pregnancy losses between 12 to 20 weeks' gestation; however, the relative importance of these etiologies is not well quantified. Because the etiology of so many of the second trimester losses is not clear, and a majority of them are associated with spontaneous labor and ruptured membranes, there is ample room to hypothesize that intrauterine infection, which has been implicated in both of these pregnancy complications, may also be an important etiologic component of spontaneous second trimester losses. Indeed, chorioamnionitis has frequently been described, and there are numerous case reports of amniotic fluid infection that have occurred during this gestational age period. Additionally, isolation of microorganisms from pregnancy products has been reported to be more common in women who have spontaneous midtrimester pregnancy loss when compared with women who have induced abortions [13, 14] . Furthermore, several treatment trials have shown a reduction in second trimester abortions with antibiotics.",

The fetal death rates are approximately twice as high in African American women compared with white women. Stillbirth occurs far more frequently in developing countries than in developed countries, with rates as high as 100/1000 reported in some areas. Worldwide, nearly 4 million stillbirths occur in developing countries yearly [17] . In many countries, and especially the most developed ones, over the last several decades there has been a significant reduction in stillbirths. For example, from 1970 to 1998 the stillbirth rate in the United States fell from 14.0 to 6.7 per 1000 births [16] . Much of this decrease has occurred in term or near-term stillbirths, and is mostly due to improvements in medical care [18, 19] .

In a US multicenter study [18] , approximately half of the stillbirths occurred before 28 weeks gestational age, and another third of the stillbirths occurred between 28 weeks and 37 weeks. In this study, and in a number of others, the etiology of many of the stillbirths was not clear; however, many of the early gestational age fetuses died in conjunction with spontaneous preterm labor or rupture of the membranes. Placental histologic changes consistent with chorioamnionitis are found frequently in association with these early stillbirths, and these mothers are also more likely to develop postpartum endometritis. Therefore, there is substantial reason to believe that intrauterine infection may contribute to the etiology of many stillbirths, either as an initiator of preterm labor, as an initiator of ruptured membranes, or as an initiator of fetal death that ultimately results in the birth of a stillborn infant.",

In that review, we found that this relationship was strongly influenced by gestational age. The earlier the stillbirth, the more likely it will be related to an infection.

First, it is often difficult to know exactly why a specific fetus died. For example, an autopsy of the fetus and histologic study of the placenta may have findings suggestive of both infectious and hypoxic etiologies. Second, simply finding histologic evidence of infection or specific types of organisms in the placenta or on the fetus does not prove causation, nor does finding serologic evidence of infection prove causation. Neither does the presence of organisms in internal fetal tissues, although this finding clearly increases suspicion of an infectious etiology. Third, infection may cause a stillbirth that initially may not appear to be related to infection at all. The stillbirths associated with rubella-induced congenital anomalies, or with the nonimmune hydrops caused by parvovirus, were not originally seen as infectionrelated. Finally, organisms that now are quite clearly associated with stillbirth, such as parvovirus and Ureaplasma urealyticum, are hard to identify, and are often not sought in studies of infectious etiologies of stillbirths [10] .",

First, a maternal infection may lead to a systemic illness whereby the mother is severely ill. Perhaps because of the high maternal fever, maternal respiratory distress, or other systemic reactions to the illness, the fetus may die, although the organisms are never transmitted to the placenta or fetus. The increased fetal mortality associated with influenza epidemics or maternal polio is likely due to this phenomenon [24, 25] . Second, the placenta may be directly infected without spread of the organisms to the fetus. In these situations, reduced blood flow to the fetus may result in stillbirth. The stillbirths associated with maternal malaria infection are likely due to placental damage [26] . Third, the fetus may be directly infected through the placenta or membranes, with the infectious organisms damaging a vital fetal organ such as the lungs, liver, heart, or brain. Examples of this type of infection include the fetal pneumonia associated with Eschericia coli or group B streptococcal chorioamnionitis, or systemic infections with viruses such as coxsackie A or B [27] [28] [29] .",

U urealyticum is an organism that may precipitate early preterm labor by infecting the fetal membranes without causing a fetal infection.

In many developing countries, neonatal group B streptococcal infections are rare and the contribution of gram-negative organisms to neonatal sepsis is proportionately greater. Many of these neonatal infections appear to be contracted in utero before delivery. For the most part, these organisms enter the fetus by way of the amniotic fluid, infecting the lungs, causing a fetal or neonatal pneumonia. Both group B streptococous and the gram-negative organisms cause meningitis as well. Finally, infections such as syphilis and some virus infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella, echovirus, coxsackievirus, measles, and herpes simplex are clearly causal for neonatal death, as are other transplacentally transmitted infections such as listerosis and even occasionally tuberculosis. In any case, based on these reports, the authors estimate that in the United States and other developed countries, less than 10% of neonatal mortality is due to neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis, with a much smaller portion of the mortality attributable to other infections. In lesser developed countries, the neonatal mortality rates are considerably higher and the contribution of infection considerably greater. For example, in Pakistan it is estimated that half of the neonatal mortality, or as many as 30 per 1000 live births, is infection related [35] . Overall, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that of the nearly 5,000,000 neonatal deaths that occur each year worldwide, up to 40%, or 2,000,000 deaths per year, are due to infection [36] .

Nearly all the infectious causes of neonatal mortality cause postneonatal deaths as well. ",

For example, among the lowest gestational age infants who survive (23 and 24 weeks), between 25% and 50% end up having cerebral palsy. Perhaps the most commonly used definition of cerebral palsy is that of Nelson and Ellenberg [37] , who defined cerebral palsy as ''a chronic disability characterized by aberrant control of movement or posture appearing early in life and not the result of recognized progressive disease.'' Cerebral palsy is associated with damage to the upper motor neurons within the brain, and most cases present as excessive muscular tonus, spasticity with increased stretch reflexes, and hyperactive tendon reflexes. The authors also emphasize that cerebral palsy is a neuromuscular condition only, and does not imply alterations in cognitive function. Although children who have cerebral palsy are statistically more likely to have low intelligence quotients (IQs), mental retardation, or various types of seizure disorders, many children who have cerebral palsy have normal intelligence and are free of other types of neurologic disability [38] .",

For example, Stanley [40] notes that a fairly large number of cases of cerebral palsy associated with congenital rubella syndrome were described before the initiation of the rubella vaccination program, but this relationship rarely occurs in the United States today. Congenital infection with Toxoplasma gondii and CMV can also cause cerebral palsy. Older literature suggests that infection of the infant with measles, mumps, varicella, and rubella was once reported as a common cause of central nervous system (CNS) injury leading to cerebral palsy. Since the development of vaccines for many of the common childhood diseases, however, it appears that a viral etiology for postpartum acquired cerebral palsy is rare. Nelson [41] agrees, stating that although numeric documentation is lacking, judging from medical writing in the 19th century when infectious diseases were more frequent and less effectively treated, infection-related cerebral palsy was more common than it is now in developed countries. Because of these reductions, it appears that CMV has become the most common viral infection associated with a cerebral palsy-like syndrome [39] . In addition to the infections described, herpes virus infection as well as meningococcal, pneumococcal, and group B streptococcal infections of the neonate also may manifest later in life as a cerebral palsy-like syndrome.",

Among term infants in that study, chorioamnionitis increased the risk of cerebral palsy from 3 per 1000 to 8 per 1000 live births. In a more recent study, Grether and colleagues [45] examined prenatal and perinatal factors related to cerebral palsy in very low-birth weight (VLBW) California infants. In this study, chorioamnionitis was associated with a fourfold increased risk of cerebral palsy. Even more recently, term infants who have evidence of chorioamnionitis had a significantly greater risk of cerebral palsy [46] . Murphy and coworkers [47] , investigating the relationship of various antenatal and intrapartum risk factors to cerebral palsy in infants born at less than 32 weeks' gestational age, showed that in such infants, chorioamnionitis increased the risk of cerebral palsy from 3% in controls to 17% in infected infants.",

They revealed an association between intrauterine infection in the mother and both IVH and white matter damage in the newborn. In a study of more than 1000 preterm infants, intrauterine infection was associated with a doubling of the infant's risk for having IVH, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and ventriculomegaly.

Hansen and coworkers [57] studied the correlation between placental pathology and IVH in preterm infants.

Zupan and coworkers [63] , in a study of risk factors for PVL, found a strong link between intrauterine infection and the development of PVL, and that this relationship was increased in the face of premature rupture of membranes and infection. They also suggest that most of the PVL originates before birth, that susceptibility to the condition closely depends on the developmental age, and that the major etiologic components of white matter lesions in infants born late in the second trimester relate to the presence of an intrauterine infection. Perlman and colleagues [64] noted that cystic PVL, which occurred in 3% of infants weighing less than 1500 g, was associated with two clinical indicators: prolonged rupture of membranes and chorioamnionitis. The odds ratio for cerebral palsy after prolonged rupture of membranes was 6.6, and the odds ratio for cerebral palsy with chorioamnionitis was 6.8.",

Certainly various cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and others, are elevated in the amniotic fluid of pregnant women who have chorioamnionitis. Andrews and coworkers [13] have emphasized that amniotic fluid cytokines are elevated even with infection confined to the amniotic membranes. Adinolfi [65] was among the first to propose that cytokines produced in relationship to maternal infection were harmful to the developing brain of the unborn infants. Figueroa and colleagues [66] showed that elevated amniotic fluid IL-6 predicted neonatal PVL and IVH. Yoon and coworkers [67] , Kashlan and colleagues [68] , and others showed that elevated IL-6 levels in the umbilical cord were also related to the subsequent development of periventricular echodensities and echolucencies. Recent papers document the association between elevated umbilical cord blood cytokine levels and cerebral palsy [69, 70] . From these data, there seems little question that intrauterine infection, a clear predictor of preterm delivery [14] , is also a predictor of white matter lesions, IVH, and ultimately cerebral palsy. If, as has been proposed [71] , 70% to 80% of VLBW births are associated with an intrauterine infection, the high rate of cerebral palsy in these infants may well be related to this intrauterine infection.",

Prevalence is undoubtedly influenced by definition, timing of testing, and many other factors as well, but in most populations about 3% of all infants and children receive this diagnosis. Babies born prematurely and babies born following intrauterine growth retardation are all at greater risk for the development of mental retardation regardless of the definition [72, 73] ; however, most babies who have these diagnoses will eventually have IQs within the normal range. For example, on average, infants who survive weighing less than 1000 g at birth, have an average IQ about 10 points below appropriate controls. As with cerebral palsy, intrauterine infection is thought to play a role in this reduction in IQ. What is clear, however, is that the socioeconomic status and educational background of the parents greatly influence the ultimate rate of mental retardation in the population. Although perinatal infections that attack the fetus, such as group B streptococcus, herpes simplex virus, CMV, syphilis, and toxoplasmosis all are demonstrated causes of mental retardation, infection-initiated preterm birth, which will be described in detail, appears to be a more important cause of mental retardation from the overall public health perspective [74, 75] .",

Overall, about 20% of stillbirths and neonatal deaths are caused by an anomaly, as is a portion of mental retardation. Although maternal virus infections clearly can cause structural anomalies, only a very small percentage of all anomalies are likely to be viral related. For example, rubella infections, especially those occurring in the first trimester, as well as varicella infections, are associated with a wide variety of anomalies. Because of routine vaccinations to prevent rubella and other viral infections, however, these anomalies are rarely seen today in de-veloped countries. Coxsackieviruses B3 and B4 have been associated with congenital heart disease [80] . Maternal parvovirus infection, especially in the second trimester, has been associated with a fetal nonimmune hydrops, sometimes leading to fetal death. Whether it is appropriate to consider these cases as congenital anomalies is not clear. In addition, there are isolated case reports of CNS anomalies associated with parvovirus infection, but this relationship has not been confirmed epidemiologically.",

Assuming they do, the mechanism may lie in fetal cell death caused by direct infection or by changes in placental or fetal blood flow. Maternal malaria, for example, which often attacks the placenta and seems to inhibit gas and nutrient exchange, is associated with a two-or threefold increase in fetal growth restriction [26] . The impact of syphilis is similar, and in general, in developing countries, a wide variety of maternal infections are very likely responsible for a large proportion of the growth retarded infants. Because growth retardation in developed countries often appears to be associated with below average maternal size, poor nutritional status, various adverse health behaviors and hypertension, however, it is unclear what portion of the growth retardation in developed countries can be explained by an infectious etiology.",

In the last 20 years, the preterm rate in the United States has risen from approximately 9.5% to 12% [83] . Although we have made tremendous strides in keeping preterm infants alive, we have been less successful in reducing the long-term handicap rates among the survivors [84, 85] . Much of the mortality and the longterm handicap associated with prematurity occurs in the smallest or earliest gestational age newborns. For example, it is estimated that 60% of the neonatal mortality and much of the long-term handicap accrue to infants born weighing less than 1000 g and less than 28 weeks' gestational age.

For example, in 1950 Knox and Hoerner [87] noted that ''infection in the female reproductive tract can cause premature rupture of the membranes and induce premature labor.'' In their series, they noted that the membranes in all premature cases showed evidence of infection. Perhaps the most influential paper on infection and preterm birth was written in 1977 by Bobitt and Ledger [88] . In this study, they performed amniocenteses in 10 women in preterm labor with intact membranes. Seven of the women had bacterial colony counts higher than 1000 per mL, with anaerobic organisms predominating. These authors posited that bacteria can penetrate the fetal membranes and contaminate the amniotic fluid, and suggested that in patients in premature labor, the role of unrecognized amnionitis should be reevaluated. Elder and colleagues [89] approached the issue of infection and preterm birth somewhat differently. Believing that bacterial infection was causal for preterm birth, in 1971 they treated 279 ''non-bacteriuric women'' with a 6-week course of 1 g of tetracycline daily beginning at less than 32 weeks' gestational age, and compared the outcomes to women treated with a placebo. In the tetracycline-treated group there were statistically fewer preterm births.",

Beginning with Bobitt and Ledger's study [88] and extending to the present, there have now been a large number of studies in which women presenting with preterm labor and intact membranes have had an amniocentesis performed and the amniotic fluid cultured [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] . The percent of positive cultures in these studies has varied widely, ranging from no positive cultures in several small studies to as high as 50% in others. In a review of the studies performed before 1992, 100 of 863 or 12% of amniotic fluid cultures were positive. Knowing what we know now, the reason for the relatively low culture rates are quite apparent. First, many of these studies did not focus on early preterm infants, and we know that the percent of positive cultures are gestational age-related, with the proportion of positive cultures increasing with decreasing gestational age [86] . Second, few of these studies cultured for Ureaplasma or Mycoplasma or other hard-to-grow anaerobes. We now know that the most common organisms found in the uterus are Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma. We also know that in the presence of an intrauterine infection, the amniotic fluid will be positive on only half the occasions when organisms are present in the membranes [10] . For each of these reasons and possibly others, the rates of positive amnionic fluid cultures in women in preterm labor are lower than the actual rate of intrauterine infection.",

In 1979, Russell [95] , using histologic chorioamnionitis as a marker of infection, showed that virtually all births at 21 to 24 weeks were associated with an intrauterine infection, compared with only about 10% of the preterm births at 33 to 36 weeks. Mueller-Heubach and colleagues [96] and Chellam and Rushton [97] reported similar findings, which were also confirmed by Andrews and coworkers [5] in Alabama. Therefore, there is no question that the earliest preterm births are strongly associated with histologic chorioamnionitis.",

They showed that at 23 and 24 weeks' gestation, more than 60% of the women in preterm labor had organisms in the amniotic fluid. That number fell to less than 20% for women in labor at 33 to 34 weeks. To further investigate this issue, Hauth and colleagues in Alabama [99] cultured the chorioamnions of over 600 women having a cesarean section who had intact membranes. In this study, after delivery the placental membranes were opened and cultures were taken from the space between the chorion and amnion. This study design precluded vaginal or ascending infection following membrane rupture contamination of the membranes, because membranes were not delivered through the vagina and the membranes were intact at the time of delivery. The study authors found that in women in spontaneous labor delivering a less than 1000-g infant, 83% had chorioamnion cultures that were positive, whereas those delivering a more than 2500-g infant had a 20% positive culture rate [99] . For those women not in labor, undergoing an indicated cesarean section, and delivering a less than 1000-g infant, only about 10% of the cultures were positive. The researchers therefore believe that based on histology and culture results, 80% or more of women in early preterm labor, destined to deliver a less than 1000-g infant, will have organisms in the membranes before membrane rupture. They believe this association is likely to be causal for preterm birth.",

As evidence, intrauterine infections have been documented weeks or even months before a preterm birth [100] [101] [102] . For example, in Alabama, at the time of routine genetic amniocentesis at 16 to 18 weeks, it was occasionally noted that the amniotic fluid was cloudy [100] [101] [102] . For this reason, fluids were sent for routine bacterial culture, and cultures for Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma were often performed. Occasionally the cultures were positive. In nearly all cases in which the amniotic fluid was found to be infected with Ureaplasma, the women were initially asymptomatic; however, many of these women went on to deliver spontaneously at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation without clinical chorioamnionitis. The placentas, however, were nearly always positive for histologic chorioamnionitis. Similarly, using PCR techniques for the diagnosis of Ureaplasma infection in amniotic fluid, it has been demonstrated that women who are PCR-positive are substantially more likely to experience spontaneous preterm labor later in the second trimester [103] . More recently, using IL-6 as a marker of infection, it has been observed in several series that women undergoing routine genetic amniocentesis at 16 to 18 weeks and who are found to have high amniotic fluid IL-6 levels frequently deliver at less than 32 weeks [104] [105] [106] .",

What is interesting about these infections is that certain common vaginal organisms, such as group B streptococcus and E coli, are rarely found in the uterus before rupture of membranes. Furthermore, gonorrhea or Chlamydia are hardly ever found inside the uterus before membrane rupture. On the other hand, a number of other organisms, such as Ureaplasma, Mycoplasma, Gardenerella, Mobiluncus, Peptostreptococcus, and Bacteroides, are quite commonly found in the uterus before membrane rupture. Why some organisms invade the uterus before membrane rupture and others do not is not clear. Galask and colleagues [107] showed that neither Chlamydia nor gonorrhea bind to the fetal membranes, and offered the failure to attach as an explanation for their lack of entrance into the uterus before membrane rupture. What is clear about the organisms generally found in the uterus before delivery is that they generally are of low virulence. It may be that this low virulence accounts for both the chronicity described above and the fact that most of the intrauterine infections do not cause a clinical chorioamnionitis.",

For example, if the mother has a bacteremia or viremia, organisms can enter the uterus hematogenously through the placenta. Although it is believed that hematogenous spread through the placenta is rare, it almost certainly does occur. As evidence, fetuses have been infected by a wide variety of organisms during maternal septicemia, including those causing Listeria and tularemia. These organisms appear to reach the fetus through the maternal circulation [22] . Dental organisms such as Capnocytophaga and various fusiform organisms are also most likely to enter the uterus through the placenta [109, 110] . Theoretically, bacteria can enter the uterus through the fallopian tubes; however, the abdominal cavity is usually sterile. Organisms have been introduced inadvertently into the amniotic cavity at the time of amniocentesis, but this route of infection seems quite rare. Finally, and most commonly, it appears that bacteria from the vagina can ascend into the uterus through the cervix. The organisms most commonly found in the uterus are those typically found in the vagina, of which Ureaplasma is the most common. It is therefore widely believed that the organisms responsible for most early preterm birth are vaginal organisms that ascend directly from the vagina through the cervix into the uterus.",

The bacteria then take up residence in the membranes, and in about 50% of the cases enter the amniotic fluid. In a much smaller percentage of the cases, the fetus is infected as well. An alternate hypothesis is that the organisms that ultimately cause histologic chorioamnionitis actually reside in the uterus before the pregnancy. Korn and colleagues [111] observed in 1995 that nonpregnant women who had bacterial vaginosis were nearly ten times more likely to have bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms residing in the uterus than were women who did not have bacterial vaginosis. These women were far more likely to have an associated chronic plasma cell endometritis. Andrews and coworkers [112] also observed a large number of bacterial vaginosis related organisms in the uterus in healthy nonpregnant women. These data suggest that there are women who have their endometrium colonized with bacteria before pregnancy. These women are, for the most part, asymptomatic, and would probably remain so until pregnant, because these colonizations do not seem to cause much in the way of symptoms, do not hinder conception to any large degree, and have little impact on the pregnancy until the second trimester. It has been hypothesized by the authors' group [71, 86] that once the membranes become tightly applied to the decidua, essentially forming an abscess, only then do these colonizations become symptomatic. With the adherence of the membranes to the decidua at about 20 weeks' gestation, the inflammatory process accelerates, ultimately leading to a preterm birth, which usually occurs before 28 or 30 weeks' gestational age.",

            "text": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a vaginal syndrome associated with an alteration of the normal vaginal flora, rather than an infection specific to any one microorganism. BV is diagnosed clinically by the Amsel criteria, which include: (1) the presence of clue cells, (2) a pH higher than 4.5, (3) a profuse whitish discharge, and (4) a fishy odor when that discharge is treated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) [113] . For research purposes, bacterial vaginosis is often defined by the Nugent criteria, whereby air-dried vaginal smears are Gram-stained, and are scored based on the number of lactobacillus (which tend to be low), and the presence of organisms that look like Mobiluncus and Bacteroides, which tend to be high [114] . A score of 7 to 10 has traditionally been used to diagnose BV; however, a recent study [115] suggests that only the very highest scores (ie, 9 and 10) may be associated with preterm birth. Nevertheless, BV diagnosed by a score of 7 to 10 has been associated with a one and a half-to threefold increased risk of preterm birth in more than 20 studies [116] [117] [118] . Therefore, there is more evidence for this association than for most epidemiologic associations reported in the literature. Interestingly, black women are considerably more likely to have BV than white women [119] . Though not explained by different rates of sexual intercourse or feminine hygiene practices, this two-to threefold difference may explain part of the racial differences in spontaneous preterm birth [120] . In fact, nearly 50% of the excess preterm births and preterm-associated mortality in black versus white infants may be explained by the increase in vaginal and intrauterine infections. Importantly, from a mechanistic point of view, women who have large quantities of these bacteria in the vagina appear more likely to have the same bacteria in the uterus associated with histologic chorioamnionitis. Gravett and colleagues [91] , Silver and coworkers [121] , Watts and colleagues [98] , Hillier and colleagues [122] , Krohn and coworkers [123] , and others have all shown that there is an association linking BV and subsequent amnionitis, often with similar organisms. The mechanism by which BV is associated with amnionitis and preterm birth is uncertain, but it likely is the result of ascension of the vaginal organisms into the uterus either before, or early in, the pregnancy.",

With virtually each of these organisms, a range of associations has been reported, varying from none to a strong relationship with preterm birth. In total, it appears that spontaneous preterm birth (defined as a birth following labor or rupture of the membranes) occurs more frequently in women who have and infection than in those who do not; however, even though gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, and other sexually transmitted diseases are usually found more frequently in women who have a spontaneous preterm birth, these women often have other risk factors as well. Furthermore, most studies claiming an association between various infections and preterm birth have not considered many of these confounding variables. As an example, gonorrhea has been associated with spontaneous preterm birth in a number of studies [124] . Almost none of these adjusted for most risk factors and especially for the presence of BV [125] . Therefore, although it is likely that maternal gonorrhea infection is associated with an independent two-or threefold risk for spontaneous preterm birth, this conclusion is not certain. As opposed to the organisms associated with BV, the gonococcus is rarely found in the amniotic fluid or the fetal membranes in women who give birth prematurely. Syphilis is widely reported to be associated with a twofold increased risk of preterm birth, and this relationship is relatively consistent in most studies [126] .",

In the Preterm Prediction Study [129] , women tested for Chlamydia trachomatis at 24 weeks' gestation had about twice as many preterm births associated with the presence of this organism as did uninfected women; however, after adjusting for other risk factors, this association was no longer significant, contributing to the continuing uncertainty about whether chlamydia infection plays a causative role in preterm birth. Many of the other sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and genital herpes simplex virus, have been associated with an increased risk for spontaneous preterm birth in some, but not most, studies. In general, the evidence for a causative link between maternal infection with these organisms and spontaneous preterm birth is poor [75] .",

Maternal pneumonias and other systemic infections such as appendicitis also appear to increase the risk of preterm birth. Recently, research efforts have focused on exploring the relationship between maternal periodontal disease and subsequent preterm birth [110, 130] . This association has now been confirmed at several study sites.

Recent reports suggest that a maternal infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus can result in preterm birth as well [132] . In the absence of major systemic disease, the evidence for a relationship between maternal viral infection and preterm delivery is based mostly on case reports. For example, a number of fetuses that had an intrauterine CMV infection have been noted to deliver preterm, although the denominator for such observations is unknown. In the several studies in which asymptomatic women undergoing genetic amniocentesis were evaluated for intraamniotic viral infection using PCR techniques, a number of different viral DNAs were identified in the amniotic fluid, but their presence was not related to subsequent preterm birth [133] . Therefore, it seems unlikely that maternal viral infection plays an important role in preterm birth. Because of the limited information available, however, further study of this potential relationship is in order.",

Cytomegalovirus infection is estimated to be present in about one third of all pregnant women [149, 150] . Infants are virtually never infected with Trichomonas. Manifestation of bacterial vaginosis in the infant is unknown; however, neonatal infections with U urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, various bacterioides spp, Gardnerella or other bacterial vaginosis-related organisms have been reported, although rarely [151] . Congenital syphilis is usually transmitted after the first trimester, but can be transmitted at any time during the pregnancy or at delivery. N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, and the hepatitis B virus rarely infect the fetus in the prenatal period and are almost never found in the uterus before rupture of the membranes [1, 74, 124, [152] [153] [154] . Instead, the fetus generally acquires these organisms as it passes through the birth canal. Fetal infections with herpes simplex virus rarely occur before the rupture of the membranes [155, 156] . Instead, the vast majority of transmissions occur after the rupture of the membranes or in the intrapartum period. Transmission rates to the fetus vary depending on whether the infection is primary or recurrent. Neonatal HIV infection may be acquired prenatally, but studies of second trimester abortuses suggest that early in utero infection is rare. Using a mathematical model, Rouzioux and colleagues [157] estimated that one third of the transmissions occur in the last 2 weeks of pregnancy and two thirds occur in the intrapartum period. Women who have an HIV infection and whose membranes rupture more than 4 hours before delivery or who are delivered vaginally are, in most studies, more likely to transmit this infection to their neonates [158] [159] [160] .",

For a subset of maternal infections that are associated with fetal infection, Table 4 indicates not only the maternal and infant prevalences in the 4 million births per year in the United States, but also the approximate number of mothers and infants who have an infection. Also displayed in this table is the approximate number of infants each year in the United States who have specific types of sequelae associated with direct fetal or infant infection. The potential excess in preterm births attributable to various infections and the sequelae associated with those preterm births are discussed later. When translated into the total US population, this means that there are approximately 4000 to 8000 pregnant women per year who have syphilis, hepatitis B, or HIV; about 40,000 pregnant women per year infected with gonorrhea; about 80,000 pregnant women who have Trichomonas; perhaps 200,000 pregnant women who have chlamydia; and approximately 800,000 pregnant women per year who have herpes simplex virus or BV. It is estimated that approximately 1.3 million pregnant women are infected/colonized with CMV. Again, these numbers are our best estimates for infection for the entire population of pregnant women who give birth in the United States each year. Subpopulations of women who have markedly higher and lower prevalences have been described. For both herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus, it is assumed that previous infection, as defined serologically, is associated with persistent infection. ",

These are estimates of outcomes achieved in the United States with current medical practices. From the existing literature, it is estimated that of the 1920 infants infected with syphilis at the time of birth, approximately 600 will be stillborn or will die as neonates, and about 600 will have long-term neurological or other sequelae. Approximately 720 of these 1920 infants will live and not have apparent long-term sequelae. With gonorrhea, assuming no ophthalmologic disease because of prophylaxis, there will be few major sequelae in the infant from neonatal infection. Of the 100,000 infants infected with chlamydia at birth, again assuming no long-term ophthalmologic sequelae because of prophylaxis, it is estimated that there will be approximately 20,000 cases of chlamydial pneumonia, nearly all of which will regress spontaneously or respond to antibiotics and not result in long-term sequelae or death [135] . Without immunoprophylaxis, of the 12,000 infants infected with hepatitis B virus at birth, approximately 4000 will ultimately develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma [140, 162] . These numbers should be substantially reduced with routine neonatal hepatitis B immunoglobulin prophylaxis and vaccination, and although the numbers are unknown, the authors estimate that about 300 will develop cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma sometimes in their lives. Of the 1200 infants infected at birth with herpes simplex virus, an estimated 400 will die during the perinatal period, approximately 400 will have neurological sequelae, and 400 will have neonatal disease but no long-term sequelae. Of the 40,000 infants infected with CMV, approximately 7% will have signs of disease in the neonatal period. Of these 2800 infants, some 300 will die, whereas 2000 more will have major neurological sequelae. Newell [163] estimates that as much as 7% of all cases of cerebral palsy are due to CMV infections. Later in life, an additional 5000 infants will have significant hearing loss associated with the CMV infection [147] . As stated above, it is estimated that with maternal and infant prophylaxis, fewer than 100 infants per year in the United States will be infected with HIV. It is assumed that even with treatment, each of these infants will ultimately manifest AIDS and die of the disease.",

From these numbers and the rates of maternal infection, assuming a 10% rate of prematurity in the general population, the excess number of preterm births per year in the United States associated with maternal infection with each organism can be calculated ( Table 5) . As an example, if 40,000 pregnant women in the Unites States are infected per year with gonorrhea, and if these women have a 30% instead of a 10% rate of spontaneous preterm birth, maternal gonorrhea infection may be associated with an estimated 8000 excess preterm births. Of the 4800 women who have syphilis, assuming a twofold increase in preterm birth, approximately 480 excess preterm births due to syphilis may occur in the United States each year. Assuming a twofold increase in preterm birth, with 200,000 mothers having chlamydial infection each year, as many as 20,000 excess preterm births may be associated with maternal chlamydial infection. Applying this same logic to maternal BV infections and assuming a twofold increase in preterm birth associated with BV, of the 800,000 women who have BV, an excess of 80,000 preterm births may occur.",

If these assumptions are correct, prematurity secondary to maternal gonococcal infections may be responsible for approximately 400 perinatal deaths and 400 children experiencing long-term neurological sequelae. Through its influence on preterm birth, syphilis would be responsible for an additional 16 perinatal deaths and for 16 children who have long-term neurological sequelae. Through its impact on preterm birth, chlamydial infection might account for as many as 1000 excess perinatal deaths and 1000 children who have long-term disability. Maternal BV, because of its high prevalence in the population and an associated twofold increase in preterm birth, may be responsible for approximately 80,000 excess preterm births, 4000 perinatal deaths, and 4000 children who have long-term neurological sequelae.

In contrast to these relatively rare outcomes, approximately 400,000 infants are born prematurely each year, and of these, more than 20,000 die in the fetal or the neonatal period, and another 20,000 have neurological sequelae. If the projected effect on preterm birth by BV and the other organisms proposed here is correct, as many as 100,000 preterm births and 5000 or more of the deaths, as well as a similar number of the major disabilities, may be associated with maternal infections. Because some studies suggest that some of the preterm births associated with BV and intrauterine infection may be prevented, it seems that the greatest potential for reducing adverse outcomes of pregnancy associated with maternal infection lies in preventing or treating BV and intrauterine infection-associated preterm births.",
