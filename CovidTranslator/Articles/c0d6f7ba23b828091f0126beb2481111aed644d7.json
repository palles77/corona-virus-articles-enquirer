The glycoprotein E 1 (29kDa) is mostly embedded in the membrane and plays a crucial role in the virion architecture. However, a short N-terminal domain protruding out of the particle mediates complement-dependent neutralisation, and induces alpha interferon synthesis, likely through a direct interaction with the lymphocyte membrane.",

Up to 1980, only limited information was available on the polypeptide constitution and the genome characteristics of TGEV (Garwes et al., 1976; Brian et al., 1980) . During the last few years there has been a substantial accumulation of experimental molecular data. The scope of this paper is to review briefly current information about the organisation of the TGEV genome and the functions associated with the structural domains of the envelope glycoproteins. GENOME STRUCTURE Partial sequence analysis of cloned virion RNA and characterisation of virus-specific intracellular RNAs have led to a proposed model for TGEV genome organisation and expression which is depicted in Fig. 1 . The sequence of the 3'-most 8300 nucleotides of the genomic RNA of Purdue-115 cell-adapted strain has been determined; it encompasses the whole part of the genome which is expressed through subgenomic RNAs . The remaining part, of the genome (approximately 20 kilobases long), is thought to encode the viral replicase/transcriptase, as shown in the case of IBV (Boursnell et al., 1987 ) . The three largest genes sequenced, encoding the structural proteins, are oriented according to the consensus gene order of coronaviruses: 5'-E2-E l-N-3'. Four additional major open reading frames (ORFs), poten- tially coding for non-structural polypeptides, can be deduced from available sequence data. The number and distribution of the latter differ from that of both MHV and IBV.",

Six subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized in non equimolar amounts in TGEV-infected cells (Jacobs et al., 1986; . They form, together with the full-length genome RNA, a 3' coterminal nested set, a distinctive feature of coronaviridae. The synthesis of these molecules has been demonstrated to occur through a discontinuous transcription process, in which a short leader sequence ( ~ 70 bases) is joined to the body of each RNA (review: Lai, 1986) . The nucleotide composition of the leader sequence remains to be determined in the case of TGEV. A consensus sequence 5 'AACUAAAC3', found in each intergenic region of TGEV, is assumed to act as a transcription-initiation signal for the leader-polymerase complex. The translationally active part of each mRNA corresponds to the segment which is not redundant with smaller species.

In vitro translation of mRNA 3 gave rise to a 24 kDa polypeptide (Jacobs et al., 1986 ) , presumably encoded by X2b. A highly hydrophobic polypeptide of 9 kDa has been predicted from ORF X 1 present on mRNA 4 . None of the above species has been characterised as yet in TGEV-infected cells. However, a 14 kDa polypeptide has been shown to be expressed (Wesley and Woods, 1986) , which reacted with an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the ORF X3 found on mRNA 7 (Garwes et al., 1988) .

Near the C-terminus, a hydrophobic segment of about 20 residues is assumed to anchor the protein into the lipid membrane. The internal domain, about 35 residues long, is divided into 2 parts: a stretch with a high ratio of cysteine residues (50%), which are putative fatty acylation sites, and a hydrophilic stretch, likely protruding inside the virions. The ectodomain thus forms the essential part of the protein. At 1/4-1/5 from the carboxy-end, an amphipatic alpha helix 8 nm long is pre- dicted, which is thought to be responsible for the association of 2 or 3 E2 subunits through a coiled-coil interaction, as shown for the influenza HA protein. Such a structure may explain the elongated shape of the peplomer's stem . Approximately at the middle of the polypeptide chain a sequence DRTRG might correspond to a vestigial site of cleavage, whereas a functional cleavage sequence gives rise to a heterodimer peplomer protein in IBV and MHV. The amino half of E2 molecule has an overall hydrophobic profile, which reflects the existence of a tightly packed core in the globular part of the peplomer.",

Most of the critical neutralisation determinants are clustered in a discrete area comprising the two topologically related sites A and B. Whereas the A, B and D sites are highly conserved among TGEV strains from different origins, the C site exhibits slight variation. Prokaryotic expression of E2 gene fragments allowed the characterisation of the latter as a continuous epitope of 10 residues. Controlled proteolytic digestion of E2 has been shown to generate two reactive fragments of 26 kDa and 14 kDa recognised by site A-B and D MAbs, respectively. Partial amino acid sequencing permitted the localisation of these fragments in two distinct regions of the E2 primary structure (Delmaset al., 1990) . Furthermore, amino acid substitutions capable of conferring neutralisation resistance were identified in each region by direct RNA sequencing of the genome of site A or D antigenic mutants (Laude et al., unpublished results) . All four antigenic sites appeared to be located in the amino-half part of E2 (Fig. 2 ) .",

This observation is consistant with the fact that the site D lies in the last 250 Nterminal residues of E2, i.e. the region which is the most divergent between TGEV and FIPV (Jacobs et al., 1987) . Hence, it can be speculated that determinants important in modulating the virus tropism might reside in this domain of E2.

The remaining half of the polypeptide comprises an amphiphilic region presumably associated with the inner part of the membrane, and an hydrophilic C-terminus.

A series of epitope mutants were selected on the basis of their resistance to complementmediated neutralisation towards the IFN-induction blocking MAbs. All the relevant amino acid substitutions identified by sequencing of mutant E 1 genes were localised within the last 22 N-terminal residues.
