Despite well-established guides and recommendations regarding environmental surface cleaning and disinfection, there are several challenges in resource-limited settings. This viewpoint article will discuss the practice of environmental cleaning in resource-limited settings including challenges and relationship between environment and healthcare-associated infections in this setting and outlines pre-requisites to overcome these challenges. Recent findings Despite several barriers and challenges, environmental cleaning is a crucial component to help reduce transmission of healthcare-associated infections and multidrug-resistant pathogens as well as emerging infectious disease-associated pathogens in resource-limited settings. However, there is a need to develop a multi-modal strategy together with a mechanism for monitor and feedback to improve the practices of environmental cleaning in resource-limited settings. Summary Additional researches on the barriers and implementation gaps and the role of collaborative network as well as how to apply technology would provide significant insights on the practices of environmental cleaning in resource-limited settings.",

It has also been well demonstrated that contact with the contaminated environment by healthcare personnel (HCP) is equally as likely as direct contact with a patient to lead to contamination of the healthcare provider's hands or gloves that may result in patient-to-patient transmission of nosocomial pathogens [4\u2022]. Thus, environmental surfaces and shared noncritical medical equipment may become contaminated with infectious agents and may contribute to cross-transmission by acquisition of transient hand carriage by HCP [5\u2022]. Furthermore, evidence also suggested that a patient admitted to a room previously occupied by a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, or Clostridium difficile is at substantially increased risk for acquiring these pathogens [6-9, 10\u2022] . Therefore, improved cleaning and disinfection of room surfaces will decrease the risk of HAIs in both resourceavailable and resource-limited settings.",

            "text": "Environmental cleaning practices and challenges in resource-limited settings Standard methods to improve cleaning/disinfection of environmental surfaces in hospital rooms include improving cleaning/disinfection by environmental service workers through education and feedback on cleaning effectiveness (e.g., use of fluorescent dyes), \"no-touch\" methods (e.g., UV-C irradiation), and in the future possible use of self-disinfecting surfaces (e.g., impregnating or coating surfaces with heavy metal, such as silver or copper, or a germicide) [11, 12\u2022, 13\u2022] . In resource-limited settings, with the limitation of access to technology, it is important to adhere to basic concepts of environmental cleaning by the use of a risk stratification matrix to help determine the needed frequency of environmental cleaning/disinfection [14] . Table 1 provides an example of such risk stratification. Data on practice of environmental cleaning/disinfection in resource-limited settings is limited. Notable, a national survey in Thailand Heavy contamination: surfaces and/or equipment that are routinely exposed to copious amount of blood and/or other body fluids (e.g., burn unit, dialysis unit, emergency department). Moderate contamination: surfaces and/or equipment are not routinely, but may become contaminated with blood and/or other body fluids (e.g., patient room, bath room if patient is incontinent). Light contamination: surfaces and/or equipment that are not expose to blood or body fluid. Interpretation of total score (e.g., lounges, office): Hi-touch: surfaces that have frequent contact with hand (e.g., door knobs, bed rails, computer keyboard); Low-touch: surfaces that have minimal contact with hands (e.g., wall, ceiling, mirror). 7: High risk: clean after each case/event/procedure and at least twice per day, clean additionally as required. 4-6: Moderate risk: clean at least once daily, clean additionally as required (e.g., gross soiling). 2-3: Low risk: clean according to a fixed scheduled, clean additionally as required (e.g., gross soiling) [15] revealed that 9 90% of surveyed hospitals (n = 212) reported having implemented an environmental cleaning/disinfection (ECD) protocol. However, only 55.2% (117/212) had an ECD checklist available and 43.4% (92/212) had a mechanism to audit ECD practices. Among hospitals implementing an ECD protocol, high adherence to implemented ECD protocols and to ECD checklists was documented only in 57.1% (109/ 192) and 57.3% (67/117), respectively. Because routine and terminal environmental cleaning by environmental service workers are frequently inadequate [16\u2022] , these data emphasize the need to have mechanisms for monitoring adherence to ECD protocols as well as to ECD checklists. Interestingly, methods used to audit ECD practices include visual inspection of cleanliness (66%), microbiological monitoring (57%), fluorescence marking (14%), and ATP or bioluminescent testing (10%). It is recognized that barriers and challenges for hospitals to effectively implement ECD protocol include staff concerning, inadequate education provided to staff, lack of resource and funding, time constraints, and uncertainty regarding which cleaning and disinfecting products to use. Simple suggestions to reduce environmental-related infection in a resourcelimited setting, if implementable, include (1) all mattresses should be covered with plastic liner that completely encloses the mattress, which makes cleaning easier and eliminates possibility of mattress becoming contaminated with liquids and harboring bacteria;",

Furthermore, the role of environmental cleaning has been highlighted in one national survey in Thailand that demonstrated the association of the presence of environmental cleaning service with the reduction in MDR-A. baumannii rates [25] . In a recent network meta-analysis [26] that included work from resource-available and resource-limited settings, the impact of environmental cleaning might have some differential effects on different MDR-Gram-negative bacilli. While a combination of infection prevention approaches inclusive of standard practice (e.g., adherence to hand hygiene and contact precaution recommendations), and antibiotic stewardship, environmental cleaning, and source control was the most effective intervention to prevent MDR-Gram-negative bacilli infection, environmental cleaning played a critical role of control of both MDR-A. baumannii and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) [26] . Together, these data highlight the need to enhance environmental cleaning to help effectively control MDR-Gramnegative pathogens particularly MDR-A. baumannii in resource-limited settings.",

Investigators used rodac plate cultures performed before cleaning, after manual cleaning, and after a hydrogen peroxide system. Despite the fact that the hydrogen peroxide system produced the best outcome in reducing bioburden of pathogens, the rodac plates revealed that the highest pathogens bioburden occurred after manual cleaning, which emphasizes the need for education and training for environmental staff in resource-limited settings. Additionally, in a two-stage observational study comparing manual bed cleaning in high-and low-resource settings [27] , mattresses in low-resource settings were found to be highly contaminated prior to cleaning. Notable, cleaning significantly reduced biological contamination of mattresses in low-resource settings. After training, the contamination observed after cleaning in both the high-and low-resource settings seemed comparable and cleaning with appropriate types of cleaning materials reduced the contamination of mattresses adequately. Predictors for contaminated mattresses in a low-resource setting included the following: type of product used, type of ward, training, and the level of contamination prior to cleaning. Authors concluded that routine manual cleaning by trained staff can be as effective in a low-resource setting as in a high-resource setting [27] . Thus, a multi-modal strategy inclusive of training of domestic services staff, availability of adequate time to clean beds between patients, and application of the correct type of cleaning products is needed.",

Lastly, strong organization safety culture and participating in collaborative network to reduce healthcare-associated infections may also play a significant role to help enhance the effort of HAIs and MDR pathogens control in resource-limited settings, as suggested by a national survey in the USA, Japan, and Thailand [28] [29] [30] .",

These gaps include the role of environmental cleaning on the transmission of HAIs and MDR pathogens in resource-limited settings where the magnitudes of problems may be more than resource-available settings. Researches on the barriers and implementation gaps should provide some insights to help improve the unmet needed pre-requisite for the environmental cleaning program as well as to help device appropriate intervention to improve environmental cleanings in resource-limited settings. The role of collaborative network emphasizing on basic environmental cleaning principle will also be needed to be explored. Lastly, because in most of the resource-limited setting, most patients are in multi-bed units making the use of UV devices and hydrogen peroxide systems become impractical, the study on the appropriate technology that is suitable for infrastructure, climate, and resource as well as their costeffectiveness would provide more insights into the science of environmental cleaning in resource-limited settings.",

Mechanisms to monitor, audit, and feedback should be available. Several pre-requisites inclusive of leadership support, availability of hospital epidemiologist, appropriate education, and training for staff as well as implementation of multi-modal strategy are essential for establishing an effective environmental cleaning program in resourcelimited settings.",
