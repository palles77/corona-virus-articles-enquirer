In all the abundance of mitochondria observed ultrastructurally was accompanied by an increase in enzymatic activities of respiratory complexes I (NADH dehydrogenase), II (succinate dehydrogenase) IV (cytochrome c oxidase), and V (ATPase). Western blot analysis failed to detect uncoupling protein in the tumors. The elevated respiratory enzyme activities were paralleled by an increase in the mitochondrial DNA content. Restriction analysis of mitochondrial DNA gave no indication of heteroplasmy or other gross alterations. We conclude that the mitochondrial proliferation in oncocytic tumors is probably not the result of a compensatory mechanism for the deficiency in enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.",

The common feature of oncocytic tumors is an extreme abundance of mitochondria within the transformed cells that is often associated with increased activity of a number of enzymes, including cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, DPNH-and TPNH diaphorase (Fischer 1961; Lindsay and Arico 1963; Tandler 1966; Tremblay and Pearse 1959) . Additionally, ultrastructural studies of oncocytic tumors have shown that these organelles are often morphologically abnormal (Eble and Hull 1984; Goebel etal. 1980; Tandler 1966) . Morphological changes in mitochondria Offprint requests to: D. Ebner have sometimes been accompanied by mitochondrial malfunction (Capaldi 1988 ) and it has been suggested that mitochondrial proliferation may represent a mechanism to compensate for this mitochondrial deficiency (Fischer 1961; Altmann 1990) , like the physiological response to elevated energy demand (Williams 1986 ). This idea is further supported by the observation that myopathies resulting from a mitochondrial disorder are often characterized by increased numbers of these organelles (for review see: Capaldi 1988) .",

While this argues against a close association between synthesis of thyroid hormone and oncocytic change, it does not exclude the possibility that oncocytomas are especially responsive to the hormone due to the expression of the respective receptors. Probably differential expression of such receptors accounts for the tissue-specific influence on mitochondrial abundance by thyroid hormone. While hypothyroid animals show a decrease in muscle mitochondria (Dudley et al. 1987) , no change in the number of those organelles is observed in the liver in either hypo-, or hyperthroid rats (Jacovcic et al. 1978) .

High levels, compared with controls, of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) and NADH dehydrogenase (complex I) as well as moderately elevated levels of mitochondrial ATPase in the oncocytic cells were observed. While most of the tumors consisted exclusively of cells with elevated enzyme levels, some tumors showed highly reactive foci surrounded by cells with normal enzyme activities (nos. 3, 4, 8) . In one tumor (no. 7) small areas of histochemically inert cells were interspersed within the majority of cells which showed high activities for all the enzymes tested. No differences in histochemical enzyme activities were found between oncocytic adenomas and carcinomas (Table 1) . of a particularly high energy demand in oncocytic tumors. Their high activities of respiratory enzymes are in apparent contradiction to their slow growth characteristics, unless one assumes an uncoupling of ATP synthesis from the electron flow in the respiratory chain. Such an uncoupling is naturally observed in the brown fat of hibernating animals or newborn infants due to the presence of uncoupling protein (UCP). To address the question whether UCP is expressed in oncocytic tumors, we isolated mitochondria from five tumors and analysed them by immune blotting with an antiserum directed against hamster-UCP. Human UCP is recognized by this antiserum as shown by the signal obtained with the brown fat control tissue (Fig. 3, lane c) . In contrast, UCP was not detectable in any of the oncocytic tumors tested (Fig. 3, lanes a and b; only two of the five tumors are shown). Therefore an uncoupling of the respiratory chain due to the presence of uncoupling protein seems very unlikely. Quantitation of mtDNA in oncocytic tissues. We next asked whether the abundance of mitochondria in oncocytic tumors is accompanied by a parallel increase in the mtDNA content or whether the total number of mtDNA molecules per cell remains constant, in which case the average copy number of mtDNA molecules per organelle would be reduced. To address this question we quantitated mtDNA in relation to nuclear DNA. The result of this examination, together with that of the respiratory enzyme activities and the observed abundance in mitochondria is compiled in Table 1 . An elevated mtDNA content, ranging from three-to nine-fold higher than in controls, was seen in all tumor samples with high enzymatic activities and/or large numbers of mitochondria. Only one tumor (no. 8) failed to show an increase in mtDNA. This may be due to the fact that this tumor was a mosaic with respect to mitochondrial function. In addition, electron micrographs did not show abundant mitochondria (see above). The results clearly show that the increase in the number of mitochondria was accompanied by an increase in mtDNA. Again, we were unable to see any differences between oncocytic adenomas and carcinomas and concluded that there is no relationship between the amount of mtDNA and the biological behaviour of oncocytomas.",

The concomittant abundance in mitochondria in affected tissues is best interpreted as a compensation mechanism to maintain the energy supply in the form of ATP synthesis provided by mitochondrial respiration. Our histochemical data show that respiratory enzymes are functional as is mito-~hondrial ATPase. This result does not, however, exclude the possibility that ATP synthesis might be uncoupled from the electron flow in the respiratory chain. l'he failure to immunologically detect uncoupling protein (UCP) argues against an USP-mediated mechanism at least in those five oncocytomas which were probed with an antiserum directed against UCP. Uncoupling by other processes, e.g. by accumulation of certain fatty acids (Luvisetto et al. 1987) , remains possible, however.",

            "text": "The present study is the first to show that the mitochondrial abundance in oncocytic tumors is accompanied by an increase in the content of mitochondrial DNA. Only recently it was reported that high cellular levels of mtDNA preceed increased expression of mito-chondrial functions in striated muscle (Williams 1986) . From that point of view the observed elevation of mtDNA could represent the primary cause of oncocytic transformation. The accumulation of organelles and the high activities of respiratory enzymes would represent a secondary phenomenon. Major determinants in the regulation of mtDNA replication are the D-loop region of mtDNA, where replication is initiated (Clayton 1982) , and the nuclearly encoded enzymes involved in the replication process. DNA alterations in both mtDNA or in nuclear genes could therefore affect mtDNA replication. For example, a cis-acting mutation in the D-loop region could enhance the affinity for components of the mitochondrial replication machinery, while a mutation in the nuclear gene encoding mtDNA polymerase could lead to a higher processivity of the enzyme. Similar effects may result from mutated components which indirectly affect mDNA replication, e.g. transcription factors or hormone receptors involved in the expression of mitochondrial proteins.",

To elucidate this problem it will be necessary to perform enzymatic and molecular analyses at the single cell level.",
