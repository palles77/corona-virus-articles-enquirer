Patients were grouped into \"classical\" high-gradient, normal-flow AS with preserved ejection fraction (EF); \"paradoxical\" low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved EF; and AS with reduced EF. Nonfailing donor hearts served as controls. AS was associated with increased fibrosis, titin-isoform switch toward compliant N2BA, and both total and site-specific titin hypophosphorylation compared with control hearts. All AS subtypes revealed titin and matrix alterations. The extent of myocardial remodeling in \"paradoxical\" AS was no less severe than in other AS subtypes, thus explaining the unfavorable prognosis. S evere symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) is a common cardiac disease associated with poor prognosis in the absence of heart valve replacement (1) . In AS, chronically elevated afterload induces left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, increased myocardial stiffness, and impaired relaxation (2, 3) . This myocardial remodeling is associated with progressive dyspnea, the most common symptom of AS, and poor prognosis (1) .",

This isoform transition may be compensatory, to counteract the increased stiffening from myocardial fibrosis. In contrast, for AS patients, it is not clear whether titin isoforms switch toward N2BA, N2B, or not at all (16) (17) (18) . In addition, there are no studies of titin isoform expression in different hemodynamic subtypes of AS. Phosphorylation of titin is another parameter that determines myocardial passive stiffness (14) , but likewise, has not been studied in hemodynamic subtypes of AS. To our knowledge, site-specific titin phosphorylation has never been investigated in human AS, but would be important to measure in particular at 2 mechanically active regions within the titin springs present in both the N2B and N2BA isoforms, the N2B-unique sequence (N2Bus) and the proline/glutamate/valine/lysine-rich (PEVK) region, because the stiffness of these segments is altered when they become phosphorylated (14) or dephosphorylated (19) .",

However, the hemodynamic analysis revealed fundamental differences between classical high-gradient, normal-flow AS; paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved LV ejection fraction; and AS with reduced EF. In particular, there were significant differences in aortic mean gradient, stroke volume, valvuloarterial impedance Z, LVEF, and BNP ( Table 1) . A trend toward worse outcome was observed in patients with paradoxical AS after aortic valve replacement (1-year survival was 63%, compared with 93% in classical AS). This trend is consistent with earlier findings (9) .",

However, myocytes isolated from 4-week-old mdx mice treated with either PMO dosing regimen exhibited a significant increase in flavoprotein oxidation in response to BayK(-) (Figures 1D and 1E ). Both treatment regimens rescued the response. BayK(\u00fe) did not significantly alter flavoprotein oxidation in wt or mdx myocytes ( Figure 1E ). Mitochondrial electron transport chain uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone increased flavoprotein signal confirming the signal was mitochondrial in origin ( Figures 1D and 1E) . These data indicate that treatment of pre-cardiomyopathic mdx mice with a short-term, high-dose PMO treatment regimen restores metabolic activity in the mdx heart. Figures 2B and 2C) .",

Accommodation is required to allow a user to focus on instruments and digital objects at the same simulated distance (28) (e.g., surgical guidance overlays, within \"personal space\" and \"action space\"). Disparity between vergence depth displayed by HMD and accommodation expected by HVS is referred to the vergence and accommodation conflict (VAC) and is responsible for discomfort at these close working distances (29) .

HIGHLIGHTS The extent of myocardial fibrosis and the degree of isoform-expression and phosphorylation changes in cardiomyocyte titin were unknown in different hemodynamic subgroups of AS, including \"paradoxical\" low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved ejection fraction. Hemodynamic subtypes of AS were found to exhibit increased cardiac fibrosis, titinisoform transition toward more compliant N2BA variants, and both total and sitespecific titin (N2Bus) hypophosphorylation compared with donor heart controls. A significant shift toward N2BA titin appeared in \"paradoxical\" AS, whereas alterations in total-titin phosphorylation and cardiac fibrosis were similar in all hemodynamic subtypes of AS, suggesting increased myocardial passive stiffness. The unfavorable prognosis of \"paradoxical\" AS could be explained by the pronounced myocardial remodeling, which is no less severe than in other AS subtypes.",

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY AND B-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed with the Vivid 7 or 9 System (General Electric, Horton, Norway) within 48 h before aortic valve replacement. Established parameters were used to quantify AS. Patients were divided into 3 groups using LVEF and mean gradient: 1) classical AS with a high gradient, normal flow, and preserved LVEF, defined as a mean transaortic gradient of $40 mm Hg, stroke volume index >35 ml/m 2 , and LVEF >50%; 2) paradoxical AS with low flow, low gradient, and preserved LVEF, diagnosed according to current recommendations as mean transaortic gradient <40 mm Hg, stroke volume index <35 ml/m 2 , and LVEF $50% (5); and 3) ASrEF, defined as reduced LVEF (<50%), regardless of transaortic gradient and stroke volume. Dobutamine echocardiography was performed in all patients with AS and reduced EF. All of these patients had a flow reserve. Patients with AS and preserved EF did not undergo dobutamine echocardiography. LV mass was calculated according to the modified method of Devereux and was related to the body surface. Valvuloarterial impedance Z (Z \u00bc SAP $ MG/SVI, where SAP is the systolic arterial pressure, MG is the mean gradient, and SVI is the stroke volume index) was calculated. Measurements of global longitudinal strain were performed by speckle tracking. Quantification of valve regurgitation was performed according to current recommendations (21). The volume of the left atrium was measured and related to the body surface. LV diastolic dysfunction with abnormal relaxation and diastolic stiffness was assumed when the criteria of the European Society of Cardiology consensus statement of 2007 were met (22). On the day of the echocardiographic examination, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was measured (normal value <100 pg/ ml). The blood samples were collected in tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. After immediate centrifugation, BNP was measured using Aortic valve replacement was performed in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Ruhr University Hospital Bergmannsheil-Bochum. During surgery, endomyocardial biopsies (30 to 40 mg) were taken from the basal septum. Samples were immediately separated into one-half stored in formaldehyde, to be used for histochemistry, and one-half frozen in liquid nitrogen, to be used for titin protein analysis. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ruhr University Bochum (approval 4379-12). CONTROL HEART SAMPLES. Nonfailing human LV samples (control group) were obtained from braindead human donors for whom normal LV function had been confirmed by echocardiographic evidence. Sample collection was done in full accordance with Australian National Health Medical Research guidelines and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney (HREC approval: 2012/2814). QUANTIFICATION OF FIBROSIS. The quantification of myocardial fibrosis was performed by an experi-marker in the size range of titin, Coomassie-stained polyvinylidenfluoride membranes served as markers of protein loading for immunoblots. Site-specific titin phosphorylation was measured within the unique N2Bus element of cardiac titin at 3 phosphoserines and within the PEVK domain of titin at 1 phosphoserine (both titin regions are mechanically active).

To clarify cell-autonomous effects of miR-24 on myocardial function during I/R, we used a Myh6-miR-24 transgenic mouse model where miR-24 is overexpressed in cardiomyocytes (Figure 4A). In response to I/R injury (Figure 4B), overexpression of miR-24 in cardiomyocytes ameliorated the damages caused by myocardial I/R compared with littermate controls (Figures 4C to 4E). The protective effects observed in our transgenic mice under myocardial I/R supports an essential role for miR-24 in reducing myocardial infarct size. miR-24 DOWN-REGULATES MULTIPLE TARGETS TO COORDINATELY PROTECT MYOCARDIUM FROM I/R INJURY. We then characterized the molecular signaling from insulin to miR-24 and determined its cardiac protection effect in vivo. A time course after insulin injection in mice followed by cardiomyocyte analysis demonstrated a significant increase in canonical signaling through Akt phosphorylation at 30 min (post-insulin infusion), which persisted for approximately 2 h (Supplemental Figure 2A).

To confirm direct binding, we generated a reporter vector containing a mutant in each 3 0 UTR of OGT, ATG4a and BIM (the sequence GAGC in the predicted seed sequences of each 3 0 UTR was mutated to ACTA). Cotransfection of the miR-24 mimic with these constructs in HEK 293T cells markedly decreased the luciferase expression from the WT sequence, but not each mutant OGT/ATG4A/BIM construct (Figure 5C).

Intriguingly, when cardiomyocytes were overexpressed with miR-24 treated with different concentrations of insulin for 1 h, we observed that miR-24 effectively reversed the insulin-induced up-regulation of OGT in high glucose-cultured cardiomyocytes (Figure 5E, bottom).

However, the mechanism underlying intensive insulin therapy-induced cardiac injury in T2DM remained unclear. Nolan et al. (32) proposed insulin resistance as a physiological defense against metabolic stress in T2DM. High doses of exogenous insulin therapy promote excess glucose uptake and glucolipotoxicity, resulting in increased ROS generation and toxic lipid accumulation that contributes to cardiac injury. We previously reported hyperglycemia repression of miR-24 through activation of aldose reductase and ROS production (20). Here, we found that short-term insulin injection decreased miR-24 in diabetic mice hearts, and intensive insulin injection also decreased miR-24 in the plasma of T1DM patients (Figure 2C). Our combined data supports that excessive insulin leads to reduced miR-24 levels, which acts as a key factor in myocardial dysfunction associated with myocardial infarction in DM.

In this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science, Wang et al. (1) suggest that impaired infarct healing in diabetics results from a hyperinsulinemia-and hyperglycemia-induced down-regulation of microribonucleic acid (microRNA, miRNA)-24 (miR-24). The authors ascribe the protective effect of miR-24 to repression of protein targets involved in apoptosis, autophagy, and protein O-GlcNAcylation. Raising miR-24 is proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for improving post-infarct healing in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In contrast with the absence of a preventative benefit of intense glucose control in a primary prevention setting (2), incident acute myocardial infarction (MI) in diabetic patients is associated with increased subsequent heart failure and mortality (3), both during initial hospitalization and long-term follow-up. However, early enthusiasm for intensive insulin treatment has given way to an agnostic approach, as large studies found benefits and potential harm associated with these strategies (4). The higher mortality and complication rates in T2D patients are multifactorial and probably related to the duration of glycemic dysregulation. Why do T2D patients treated with insulin fail to show an improved clinical outcome? Wang et al. (1) suggest that insulin therapy, added to higher baseline insulin levels reduces miR-24 levels, with adverse effects after ischemic injury. According to the authors, this may, at least in part, explain the lack of therapeutic efficacy of insulin treatment in T2D patients post-MI. A strength of this study is the use of 2 murine models, one akin to T2D and type 1 diabetes (T1D). Although insulin use increased mortality post-MI in db/db mice (T2D), insulin use decreased mortality in mice treated with streptozotocin (T1D). Wang et al. demonstrate a reduction in infarct size after ischemia reperfusion in db/db mice after systemic administration of nanoparticles containing miR-24 as well as in transgenic mice that have cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of miR-24. O-GlcNAc transferase, Bcl-2-like protein 11, and autophagy-related 4A cysteine peptidase are the proposed targets of miR-24 responsible (Figure 1). Similar to most miRNAs, miR-24 is ubiquitously expressed (5). Qian et al. (6) have previously shown that in vivo administration of miR-24 nanoparticles inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis in a mouse model of MI, thereby attenuating infarct size and reducing cardiac dysfunction by directly acting on Bcl-2-like protein 11.",

Blocking endothelial miR-24 using antagomirs limited infarct size by preventing endothelial cell apoptosis and enhancing vascularity (6). Thus, miR-24 appears to affect both endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, with opposite outcomes in post-MI remodeling Wang et al. further demonstrate a decrease in miR-24 in response to hyperinsulinemia in a clamp study in 5 T1D patients. A significant decrease in miR-24 levels was observed in the plasma of T2D compared with T1D patients. We have recently identified miR-24 as an abundant miRNA in platelets. Its plasma levels are reduced by antiplatelet therapy (12). Diabetics are known to have increased platelet reactivity (13). Reduced platelet miRNAs, including miR-24, were among the predominant changes in circulating miRNAs in patients with T2D (14,15). Insulin antagonizes platelet activation, but platelets from T2D are less sensitive to this effect due to their insulin resistance (15). Therefore, differential miR-24 detection in the plasma of T2D may reflect differential platelet reactivity, especially as the plasma isolation protocol in Wang et al. does not prevent pre-analytic platelet activation (16). The rapid reduction of plasma miR-24 seen in Wang et al.'s glucose clamp experiment supports this suggestion; as insulin levels increase, platelet reactivity is reduced and platelet \"poor\" plasma subsequently demonstrates reduced miR-24 levels (17). Although it would be an oversimplification to attribute myocardial dysfunction after MI in T2D to the dysregulation of an individual miRNA such as miR-24, the study by Wang et al. emphasizes the significance of miR-24 in the ischemic diabetic heart (Figure 1). Also, the proposed role for circulating miRNAs such as miR-24 in the pathophysiology of infarct healing in diabetics in relation to insulin sensitivity and production as demonstrated by this study encourages further exploration.",

Such diseases are usually associated with functional and structural changes within the vascular network as well as concomitant increases in oxidative stress(2). Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by impaired vasodilation, mainly due to loss of nitric oxide (NO) signaling(3,4). NO biosynthesis in the vasculature is primarily catalyzed by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)(5), and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4 ) is an essential cofactor for all 3 isoforms of NOS(6,7). When BH 4 bioavailability is limited, NOS may become \"uncoupled,\" producing superoxide at the expense of NO, thereby potentiating oxidative stress(8).",

It would now be important to establish the in vivo significance of our findings and to ascertain whether activation of the GCH1-GFRP axis could attenuate the development of hypertension in vivo in SHR and in the clinic. We have previously postulated that L-phe is not necessarily a viable therapeutic agent in itself, given its role in catecholamine biosynthesis. However, our data revealed no significant effects following both short-term and long-term L-phe challenge on dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline levels, indicating that endogenous regulatory mechanisms may tightly control the bioavailability of these catecholamines. However, our study used Lphe supplementation over a relatively short period of time and does not reflect the projected timeframe for clinical therapeutics (years). Thus, the observed lack of effect of L-phe on catecholamine biosynthesis should be treated with caution and further investigated to fully understand the impact on non-GCH1-BH 4 -NO pathways. Interestingly, SHR display significantly lower basal L-phe levels compared with WKY; this was not anticipated and may suggest that the bioavailability of L-phe may influence the GCH1-GFRP complex and hence vascular regulation in these animals. Our study builds upon an existing published reports where numerous attempts to restore NO bioavailability have been trialed by targeting different elements of the NOS-NO pathway. These pathways include substrate enhancement (via L-arginine supplementation), cofactor enhancement (via BH 4 supplementation), or manipulation of the endogenous NOS inhibitors (asymmetric dimethylarginine [ADMA] and L-NMMA) (57). L-Arginine supplementation is by far the most extensively studied, but results have been variable. Indeed the VINTAGE MI (Vascular Interaction With Age in Myocardial Infarction) randomized controlled trial demonstrated not only lack of efficacy but also higher postinfarction mortality (58). Further, a meta-analysis of L-arginine supplementation in myocardial infarction showed no efficacy (59). Thus, there are efficacy and safety concerns regarding L-arginine supplementation in cardiovascular disease patients. The endogenous NOS inhibitor, ADMA competes with L-arginine for the substrate binding site of NOS, and hence the efficacy of supplemented L-arginine is dependent upon the intracellular arginine/ADMA ratio. Finally,L-arginine has poor oral bioavailability (60), likely attributable to intestinal arginase activity, and hence L-citrulline has more recently been suggested as an alternative method to enhance L-arginine bioavailability (61).",

D oxorubicin (DOX) (Adriamycin) is a widely used antineoplastic agent of the anthracycline drug class that is effective against solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (1). Although effective, a common side effect of DOX therapy is cardiotoxicity, which affects 3% to 26% of patients and often manifests as heart failure (1,2). DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is largely dosedependent, thus limiting the use of this agent and optimal oncological treatment (3). Current guidelines to detect DOX-induced cardiotoxicity are based on the serial assessment of global systolic function. Generally, the left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) is assessed by nuclear gated blood pool studies or cardiac ultrasound",

            "text": "18). Therefore, more targeted detection of ROS activity in the heart may provide a higher sensitivity approach for detecting early cardiotoxicity that often complicates DOX therapy. Recently, a 18 F-labeled analog of dihydroethidium, 18 F-DHMT, was synthesized that permits positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging of superoxide generation in vivo(19,20). Initial studies reported an w2-fold short-term increase in 18 F-DHMT cardiac uptake, indicative of elevated ROS production, in mice following a 1-time bolus injection of DOX (20 mg/ kg) compared with controls (19). However, whether 18 F-DHMT is increased before a fall in LVEF in a more clinically relevant, progressive rodent model of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is unknown. Taken together, we hypothesized that the novel PET radiotracer 18 F-DHMT would provide an early in vivo index of cardiotoxicity before a decrease in systolic function in a well-established rodent model of progressive DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. METHODS ANIMAL MODEL. A schematic of the overall study design is illustrated in Figure 1. Male Wistar rats (Crl:Wl) (10 to 11 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Massachusetts) and were acclimatized to their environment for 5 days before any study procedures. All animals were housed in a temperature-controlled facility (22 C to 24 C), kept on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a standard chow diet ad libitum for the duration of the study. We employed an established model of chronic progressive cardiotoxicity (14), in which rats were treated with DOX (2.15 mg/kg intraperitoneally every 3 days for 21 days [15 mg/kg total]) (n \u00bc 10). Control rats received an equal volume of 0.9% NaCl intraperitoneally over the same period as DOX-treated rats (n \u00bc 10). All animals were used in accordance with protocols and policies approved by the Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.",

Left ventricular function was assessed in all animals with echocardiography (echo) at baseline and 4 weeks after the initiation of DOX (n \u00bc 20). At this time, a subgroup of animals (CTL, n \u00bc 5; DOX, n \u00bc 5) were imaged with 18 F-DHMT positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT).

Three days following 18 F-DHMT microPET/CT imaging, animals were injected with 99m Tc-RP805, a radiotracer that binds to the catalytic site of activated MMPs (21) for quantitative assessment of myocardial 99m Tc-RP805 uptake with gamma well counting. Left ventricular tissue was harvested to assess the degree of cardiotoxicity with standard molecular and histopathologic techniques (see below). Cardiac function/dimensions (control, n \u00bc 5; DOX, n \u00bc 5) and in vivo superoxide production (control, n \u00bc 4; DOX, n \u00bc 4) were measured in the remaining animals 6 weeks following the first dose of chemotherapy with 2D echocardiography and 18 F-DHMT microPET/CT imaging, respectively. These animals were followed for an additional 2 weeks (8 weeks following the first dose of chemotherapy) and had cardiac function reassessed with 2D echocardiography, and had LV MMP activity and the degree of cardiotoxicity determined as described in the preceding text (control, n \u00bc 5; DOX, n \u00bc 4). One DOX-treated animal died before the last imaging session at 8 weeks. 18 F-DHMT SYNTHESIS. 18 F-DHMT was synthesized by an optimized and fully automated process developed at the Yale University PET Center as recently described (20). Further detail is provided in the Supplemental Methods. The formulated 18 F-DHMT product had a specific activity of 2.19 AE 0.9 mCi/nmol for the PET imaging studies. 18 F-DHMT microPET/CT IMAGING. Rats were injected with 0.32 AE 0.02 mCi of 18 F-DHMT (0.64 AE 0.004 mg injected mass) via the tail vein and underwent microPET imaging for 10 min on a dedicated small animal hybrid microPET/CT system (Inveon, Siemens Healthineers, East Walpole, Massachusetts) 60 to 70 min following tracer injection. Following microPET imaging, all animals underwent a noncontrast microCT (80 KVp, 500 mA) for attenuation correction of the PET images and to facilitate localization of radiotracer within the myocardium for quantitative image analysis. Imaging was performed under light isoflurane anesthesia (1.5% to 2.0% isoflurane/98% to 98.5% oxygen) under physiological temperatures (35.9 C to 37.5 C).

LV volumes and dimensions, and systolic function were measured offline using Vevo Lab software (version 1.7.1, VisualSonics) by an experienced sonographer blinded to the treatment groups. Mitral E-A fusion was present in most rats due to tachycardia, thus diastolic function parameters were excluded from the analyses because many diastolic indices could not be accurately determined. GAMMA WELL COUNTING OF MYOCARDIAL 99m Tc-RP805ACTIVITY. 99m Tc-RP805 was used to quantify myocardial MMP activity in control (n \u00bc 5) and in DOX-treated (n \u00bc 5) rats at 4 weeks, and control (n \u00bc 5) and DOX-treated (n \u00bc 4) rats at 8 weeks following chemotherapy initiation with gamma well counting, as previously described(21,24)  and described in further detail in the Supplemental Methods.

Global LV 99m Tc-RP805 uptake values are reported in percent injected dose per gram of tissue. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL ANALYSES OF MYOCARDIUM. Paraffin embedded mid-ventricular sections (3 to 5 mm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Masson's trichrome (MT) by routine methods. H&E-stained sections were evaluated for the presence and severity of myocardial toxicity (cardiomyocyte vacuolation, degeneration) or necrosis, inflammation (histiocytic myocarditis), and MT-stained sections were evaluated for the presence and severity of myocardial fibrosis by a veterinarian (C.J.B.) trained in veterinary pathology with extensive expertise in rodent pathology, blinded to both treatment group and time point. The tissue parameters were assessed and scored using a semiquantitative criterion-based analysis adapted from prior published methods (25) as described in the Supplemental Methods. Myocardial degeneration, inflammation, and fibrosis were independently scored, and a total severity score was determined by summing the values for the 3 variables. IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to assess in situ cell death according to the manufacturer's directions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) using paraffinembedded tissue as described in further detail in the Supplemental Methods. To ensure that nuclei were only considered for quantification, the nuclear stain DAPI (1:20,000 dilution) (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) was used as a counterstain according to the manufacturer's directions. In addition, the extracellular matrix antibody, antilaminin (1:50 dilution) (Sigma-Aldrich), was used as a counterstain according to the manufacturer's directions to avoid counting cells within pericardial fat and blood vessel lumens. Tissue sections were imaged on a fluorescent microscope (Nikon 80i, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and subendocardial and subepicardial fields for the anterior, septal, posterior, and lateral walls of the LV were imaged at 40\u00c2 magnification for each tissue section. The number of cardiomyocytes with TUNEL-positive and DAPI costaining were counted manually per field using ImageJ software (version 1.6.0_24) (NIH, Bethesda, Maryland) (analysis grid and cell counter). The number of DAPI-stained nuclei was was corrected for the number of DAPIstained cells and multiplied by 100 to obtain a TUNEL-positive index per field. The TUNEL-positive index was then averaged over the 8 fields for subsequent statistical analysis. A biological positive control (infarct) and negative control were used to facilitate accurate TUNEL scoring. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Longitudinal mixed-effects models were used to compare the 2 groups with respect to echocardiographic variables (LVEF, global longitudinal strain, global radial strain, LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, and relative wall thickness). Repeated measures models (with unstructured covariance) were used to assess the change in these parameters over time with the group and group*time interactions used as covariates. The significance level was adjusted for multiple comparisons for overall and between-group differences at each time point (0, 4, 6, 8 weeks), thus the significance level was set at p < 0.01 for this model. Significance is provided for between-group differences only if the overall difference in least-squares means between the groups was significant. All other data were nonparametric and not matched; thus, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to determine differences between groups with a significance level set a priori at p < 0.05. All nonparametric data are expressed as median (first quartile, third quartile). Pearson's Product Moment correlations were used to determine relationships among variables of interest with a significance level set a priori at p < 0.05. RESULTS TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY-DERIVED SYSTOLIC FUNCTION AND LEFT VENTRICULAR DIMENSIONS. The most widely used clinical imaging index for detection of cardiotoxicity is the LVEF, which was not significantly reduced in DOX-treated rats at 4 weeks after initiation of treatment compared with time-matched controls. Only after 6 weeks (p \u00bc 0.0012) and 8 weeks (p \u00bc 0.0009) did DOX-treated rats have a significant reduction in the LVEF compared with time-matched controls (Figure 2A). Similarly, global longitudinal strain, a reported index of early cardiotoxicity, only trended to be lower in DOX-treated rats at 8 weeks (p \u00bc 0.02) after initiation of treatment compared with time-radial strain, another reported early index of cardiotoxicity, was not significantly different between the groups overall or at any time point (Figure 2C). LV end-diastolic volumes were significantly different between control and DOX-treated rats at 4 weeks (p \u00bc 0.0108) and 8 weeks (p \u00bc 0.006) (Figure 2D). In addition, LV end-diastolic volumes in DOX-treated rats trended lower than controls at 6 (p \u00bc 0.048) (Figure 2D). Aligned with the LVEF changes, LV end-systolic volume trended to increase at 6 weeks (p \u00bc 0.052) and was significantly increased at 8 weeks after the initiation of DOX treatment compared with time-matched controls (p \u00bc 0.0006) (Figure 2E). DOX treatment did not influence relative wall thickness (2 \u00c2 posterior wall thickness/LV internal diameter) overall or at any time point compared with controls (Figure 2F). MicroPET/CT 18 F-DHMT IMAGING OF IN VIVO MYOCARDIAL ROS PRODUCTION. Representative 18 F-DHMT microPET/CT images of each experimental group are shown inFigure 3A. The myocardium-toblood ROS SUV ratio was 35% higher in DOX-treated animals compared with time-matched controls at 4 weeks after initiation of treatment (p \u00bc 0.03), before any decrease in the LVEF (Figure 3B). At 6 weeks, this ratio was 56% higher in DOX-treated animals compared with time-matched controls (p \u00bc 0.03).Interestingly, we observed a modest inverse correlation (r 2 \u00bc 0.65; p \u00bc 0.01) between ejection fraction and in vivo myocardial ROS production at 6 weeks in DOX-treated rats (n \u00bc 4) and matched controls (n \u00bc 4) (Figure 3C), suggesting that the magnitude of the decline in LV function is associated with an increase in myocardial ROS production. Similarly, LV endsystolic volume was modestly and directly correlated (r 2 \u00bc 0.72; p \u00bc 0.007) with 18 F-DHMT uptake in these rats (Figure 3D).LV, liver, and blood SUV values for DOX-treated animals (and time-matched controls) at 4 and 6 weeks after DOX initiation are shown in Supplemental Table 1.

Temporal changes in the retention of 99m Tc-RP805 in the myocardium of the LV, which reflect myocardial MMP activity, are shown in Figure 4A for control and DOXtreated rats. At 4 weeks, 99m Tc-RP805 retention was nonsignificantly elevated in DOX-treated rats compared with time-matched controls (p \u00bc 0.056).

The early elevation in myocardial ROS production was associated with only mild histologic evidence of myocardial toxicity and occurred before any significant activation of myocardial remodeling enzymes (e.g., MMP activity) or cellular apoptosis compared with controls. Other more sensitive echocardiographic indices of systolic function were also unchanged at this time of early ROS activation. It is important to note that the subsequent drop in LVEF, which occurred over time in DOX-treated rats, was associated with a significant increase in myocardial degeneration, MMP activation, and cellular apoptosis. Thus, decline in LVEF, which is typically used clinically for detection of cardiotoxicity, occurs at a point where irreversible myocardial injury has already occurred. DOX has been shown to increase ROS levels through multiple pathways including, but not limited to, mitochondrial redox cycling of iron-doxorubicin complexes (28), activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (29), increased expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (30), and changes in the mitochondrial and nuclear transcriptome (31). In addition, DOX decreases reduced gluthathione levels and decreases catalase activity, thus impairs the inherent cardiac antioxidant defense system (11). The ROS-dependent cardiotoxic effects of DOX are numerous and include apoptosis through direct DNA damage (11,12), a reduction in mitochondrial function (32), increased fibrosis and remodeling through direct activation and increased expression of MMPs(13,14), up-regulation of the proinflammatory pathways(12), and altered excitation-contraction coupling through impairing calcium dynamics(33). It appears that excessive ROS production is a key upstream event in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, because numerous studies report an improvement or reversal of cardiotoxicity with antioxidant therapy(34)(35)(36) or direct manipulation of key molecular targets in ROS producing or quenching pathways(11,12,30,37). Our findings extend these prior observations, because we show that in vivo cardiac ROS production with 18 F-DHMT PET/CT imaging precedes the impairment in cardiac function often associated with DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

Our findings of increased in vivo cardiac ROS production before cellular apoptosis are inconsistent with these reports; however, it is unclear at this time how specific pathways that lead to cardiotoxicity may predominate, when they may be activated, and how they may interact. Differences in chemotherapy dosing and animal models may also account for discordance between studies.Accumulating preclinical evidence suggests that activation of several MMP isoforms (MMP-1, -2, -9, -14) play a key role in acute and chronic DOX cardiotoxicity by contributing to myocardial fibrosis, collagen disorganization, and contractile dysfunction (13,14). Here, we observed an elevation in myocardial MMP activity in DOX-treated rats observed at a later time point following DOX therapy (8 weeks), but not in DOX-treated animals observed at an earlier time point (4 weeks) compared with controls. In addition, we observed a modest correlation between systolic dysfunction and myocardial MMP activity in DOX-treated rats at 8 weeks and matched controls. In agreement with other studies (14,38,39), our data suggest that ROS production may lead to activation of myocardial MMPs, and that MMP activation contributes, at least in part, to LV remodeling and dysfunction. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that factors other than elevated ROS production contributed to MMP activation observed in this model. Several noninvasive imaging modalities have been proposed for early detection and prediction of cardiotoxicity. Preclinical and clinical reports indicate the use of myocardial deformation (e.g., global longitudinal strain) imaging with echocardiography, although the high technical variability of these methods and nonstandardized analysis packages have led to inconsistent support of these functional indices (6). Similarly, perturbations in some echocardiographic indices of diastolic function, such as prolonged isovolumic relaxation time, reduced mitral inflow velocity, a reduction in mitral inflow velocity/atrial flow velocity, and a reduction in mitral inflow velocity deceleration time have been shown to precede changes in systolic function after anthracycline treatment (40-42). However, the poor reproducibility of these echocardiographic indices of diastolic function has limited their application as early indicators of anthracyclineinduced cardiotoxicity (4). Magnetic resonance imaging has also been applied for evaluation of early myocardial edema and/or inflammation (T2-weighted imaging) and early cardiac fibrosis/extracellular volume changes (T1-weighted imaging) in the setting of cardiotoxic chemotherapy agents (10,43); however, the utility of these magnetic resonance indices remains controversial due to conflicting reports (43,44). A few studies have proposed radiotracer-based molecular imaging methods as highly sensitive diagnostic tools for early detection of cardiotoxicity, because these methods are able to directly target molecular (apoptosis, 99m Tc-annexin V), metabolic (fatty acid oxidation, 123 I-beta-methyl-p-iodo-phenylpentadecanoic acid), and physiological (sympathetic denervation, 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine) alterations associated with the underlying disease pathophysiology and progression (45-47). Along these lines, we hypothesized that 18 F-DHMT PET imaging of in vivo ROS production may be valuable for early detection of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, because increased ROS production plays a critical role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. In accordance with this hypothesis, weshow for the first time to our knowledge, that 18 F-DHMT imaging was able to detect an early elevation in cardiac ROS production before a fall in ejection fraction in a progressive rodent model of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. These findings extend initial studies that reported an w2-fold increase in 18 F-DHMT cardiac uptake compared with controls following a 1-time bolus injection of DOX (20 mg/kg) in mice(19). As compared with that acute model, the chronic model used in the current work more adequately resembles clinically observed anthracycline-induced",

First, 18 F-DHMT oxidation and subsequent cellular retention largely reflect superoxide activity. Therefore, the utility of measuring other ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide with peroxy-cagedcarboxamide ( 11 C-DHQ1) (49) using PET/CT for early detection of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is unknown. However, a large portion of cardiac ROS produced during DOX therapy arises from the mitochondria and NADPH oxidases, both sources of superoxide (30,37), thus supporting the use and early rise of cardiac 18 F-DHMT uptake observed in this model. Second, it is possible that DOX influences 18 F-DHMT myocardial kinetics, peripheral tissue uptake and metabolism, and tracer clearance. Thus, SUV measurements presented herein only provide a semiquantitative assessment of myocardial 18 F-DHMT retention and superoxide production in this complex model.Observed changes in the bioavailability of the tracer between groups were addressed by correcting the LV SUV to the blood SUV, which is appropriate for tracers that can be best characterized by a 2-tissue irreversible kinetic model. Because 18 F-DHMT oxidation within the myocardium is irreversible, the trend of ROS in response to chemotherapy based on our calculation of myocardium-to-blood pool SUV ratio is appropriate to account for potential confounding factors in the blood and is expected to be directly proportional to quantification parameters (e.g., K i ) derived from the kinetic analysis in dynamic PET. For example, a recent 18 F-FDG study reported that the ratio of tumor SUV to blood SUV derived from static PET had a much stronger",

Ultimately, full compartmental modeling with an arterial input function and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of blood and tissue metabolites will be needed to absolutely quantify myocardial 18 F-DHMT retention and superoxide production, although this approach will be most effectively accomplished in larger animals and humans. Third, we were unable to accurately quantify diastolic function in these animal's due to E-A wave fusion, thus we cannot exclude the possibility that diastolic dysfunction may have preceded systolic dysfunction in this model. Therefore, it is unknown at this time whether18  F-DHMT PET imaging would out perform this echocardiographic index of early anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Finally, the specific molecular pathways that led to the increase in cardiac superoxide production were not addressed in this study, and are beyond the scope of this study. However, measuring global superoxide production with 18 F-DHMT is valuable for diagnostic and predictive applications in the early assessment of DOXinduced cardiotoxicity and potentially other disease processes involving ROS activation, because superoxide produced from all pathways contributes to aberrant cell signaling and damage/death.CONCLUSIONS 18 F-DHMT PET/CT imaging was able to noninvasively detect an early elevation in myocardial ROS production in vivo, before a fall in LVEF in an established chronic rodent model of progressive DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Importantly, this early elevation in myocardial ROS was associated with only mild myocardial toxicity, and no significant changes in MMP activity or cellular apoptosis. On the other hand, a fall in the LVEF was associated with higher levels of ROS production, more advanced myocardial toxicity, activation of myocardial MMPs, and cellular apoptosis. These preliminary data suggest that 18 F-DHMT PET/CT imaging may allow for early assessment of cardiotoxicity that precedes the oftenirreversible decline in systolic function in cancer patients receiving DOX. Future investigations should focus on evaluating the ability of 18 F-DHMT PET/CT imaging to predict changes in systolic dysfunction with DOX therapy and evaluate therapeutic interventions to limit cardiotoxicity in order to fully elucidate the clinical potential of this ROSDoxorubicin is an effective chemotherapy agent but is associated with cardiotoxicity. Current noninvasive screening methods for doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity are based on the serial assessment of the LVEF. However, the measurement of LVEF is variable and unable to detect cardiotoxicity before overt, nonreversible myocardial toxicity. Decades of basic science research have indicated that ROS are key mediators in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Our study provides evidence that PET/computed tomography imaging of 18 F-DHMT, a marker of superoxide production, allows for early detection of cardiotoxicity in rodents, and that the early elevation in myocardial 18 F-DHMT uptake occurs before decrements in LVEF and overt myocardial toxicity following doxorubicin administration. COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE 2: Assessment of myocardial superoxide production can be achieved noninvasively using PET imaging of 18 F-DHMT. The application of this technique in cancer patients receiving doxorubicin or other anthracyclines may facilitate the early detection of cardiotoxicity, thereby helping to guide optimal oncological treatment and avoid cardiotoxicity. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Studies in large animal models of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and in cancer patients receiving anthracycline chemotherapy are warranted to determine the potential clinical utility of 18 F-DHMT PET imaging for early detection of cardiotoxicity. The ability to detect in vivo myocardial superoxide production with 18 F-DHMT PET imaging also provides the opportunity to apply this tracer in other cardiovascular diseases in which excessive production of ROS contributes to disease progression.",

DMD patients exhibit muscle degeneration primarily in skeletal muscles(2). However, in addition to this, patients develop dilated cardiomyopathy that is associated with cytoskeletal protein disarray, contractile dysfunction, and reduced myocardial metabolic activity(4,5).Approximately 20% of DMD patient deaths result from dilated cardiomyopathy(6).Approximately 70% of DMD-causing mutations are located between exons 45 and 55 (7). The effect of several therapeutic approaches on DMD cardiac pathology have been investigated, with varying degrees of efficacy reported (8). Effective therapy must be able to induce expression of dystrophin while improving function without inducing toxicity. We have utilized a nontoxic phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) therapy that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51, resulting in accumulation of truncated, functional dystrophin. Current clinical trials demonstrate improved ambulation and stable pulmonary function in DMD patients receiving this treatment (30 or 50 mg/kg/week, Phase 2b Eteplirsen Study 202, Sarepta Therapeutics, Cambridge, Massachusetts) (9,10). However, established cardiac abnormalities consistent with the DMD phenotype remain in these patients. Using the murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (mdx mice), we previously identified a novel mechanism by which absence of expression of dystrophin leads to myocardial metabolic dysfunction and compromised cardiac function in mdx hearts (11). This involves a structural and functional communication breakdown between the L-type Ca 2\u00fe channel (I Ca-L ) and mitochondria. We have demonstrated that in addition to regulation of calcium-dependent mechanisms, the cardiac I Ca-L plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial function through structural and functional communication via cytoskeletal proteins, independently of alterations in intracellular calcium(11,12). Myocytes isolated from mdx mice that exhibit cytoskeletal disarray due to the absence of dystrophin, exhibit impaired I Ca-L regulation of mitochondrial function(11). Importantly, this lack of response occurs in both pre-and post-cardiomyopathic mdx mice, suggesting that metabolic dysfunction precedes development of the cardiomyopathy(11).We have previously shown that long-term, low-dose treatment of pre-cardiomyopathic mdx mice with an antisense oligomer of the same PMO chemistry administered clinically to DMD pa-Cambridge, Massachusetts) to Sue Fletcher at Murdoch University, for the purpose of investigation of exon skipping and expression of dystrophin in the heart, diaphragm and tibialis anterior.

We previously demonstrated that treatment of pre-cardiomyopathic mdx mice with 10 mg/kg/week PMO for 24 weeks partially restored increases in J m and metabolic activity in response to activation of I Ca-L in cardiac myocytes (11). Because the half-life of dystrophin is shorter in cardiac versus skeletal muscle (22), a higher PMO dose may induce more skipping of dystrophin exon 23 and accumulation of functional dystrophin in the heart. Therefore, we investigated the effect of a short-term, but highconcentration PMO treatment (120 mg/kg/week), on J m and metabolic activity. First we treated 4-to 5day old pre-cardiomyopathic mdx mice (11), with either 40 mg/kg PMO 3\u00c2 per week for 3 weeks, or 120 mg/kg PMO once per week for 3 weeks. Cardiac uptake of PMO was then determined as evidence of exon skipping using RT-PCR. Treatment with both dosing regimens resulted in exon skipping (Figure 1A). Next, we examined the efficacy of a short-term, high-dose PMO treatment regimen on alterations in J m and metabolic activity induced by activation of I Ca-L in cardiac myocytes. Consistent with previous findings under calcium-free conditions, application of I Ca-L agonist BayK(-) elicited a significant increase in J m assessed as changes in JC-1 fluorescence in myocytes from 4-week-old wt mice that was attenuated with application of I Ca-L antagonist nisoldipine (",

Advances in respiratory care have resulted in an increase in life expectancy for DMD patients over the last halfcentury; however, this prolongation of life has been accompanied by an increasing number of patients experiencing from an ultimately fatal dilated cardiomyopathy (23). The effect of several therapeutic approaches on DMD cardiac pathology have been investigated, with varying degrees of efficacy (8). This includes use of antisense oligonucleotides to alter exon or splice site selection in order to restore the correct dystrophin reading frame (24) and production of a truncated, but functional dystrophin protein. Because approximately 70% of DMD-causing mutations are located between exons 45 and 55 (7), the majority of antisense oligonucleotides therapeutic development to date has focused on exon skipping within this region. It has been estimated that skipping exons 51, 45, and 53 could benefit 13%, 8.1%, and 7.7% of all DMD mutations, respectively (25). Two types of modified antisense oligonucleotides have been evaluated clinically for exon 51 skipping in DMD patients, including 2 0 O-methylated phosphorothioate and PMO. Both have elicited recovery in skeletal and pulmonary function, but with limited ability to prevent progressive cardiac decline (8). 2 0 O-methylated phosphorothioate oligonucleotides consist of a phosphorothioate backbone that contains internucleotide linkages that confer a negative charge, resulting in enhanced binding to circulatory proteins and an increase in plasma halflife (26). A phase 1 to 2a trial of this compound reported an improvement in the 6-",

A phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled study involving treatment of 8 DMD boys (7 to 13 years of age) with 30 or 50 mg/kg/week (24 weeks) demonstrated a significant increase in dystrophin production in these patients (Eteplirsen Study 201, Sarepta Therapeutics). With this, the placebo group joined the PMO treatment group. All 12 patients continued receiving PMO treatment in an ongoing extension study for over 3 years (phase 2b Eteplirsen Study 202, Sarepta Therapeutics)(9). At week 168, the continuously treated ambulatory patients continued to walk within 18% of their week-12 distance, whereas the placebo/delayed treatment cohort continued to walk within 23% of their week-36 distance(10). Pulmonary function remained stable in these patients, and the hallmark decline in respiration observed in DMD patients appears to have been repressed. Furthermore, no clinically significant treatment-related adverse events have been observed. However, cardiac abnormalities consistent with the DMD phenotype remain in these patients.Effective therapy must be able to improve cardiac function and prevent ultimately fatal dilated cardiomyopathy, without inducing toxicity.The mdx mouse manifests a mild dystrophic phenotype relative to the human disease and is therefore not regarded as an ideal clinical model for DMD. However, it provides an excellent molecular model for the study of dystrophin function and novel therapeutics. Using the mdx mouse model of DMD, we previously identified that cytoskeletal disarray due to the absence of dystrophin results in impaired regulation of mitochondrial function by I Ca-L (11). Importantly, we identified that this decrease in myocardial metabolic activity occurs in pre-cardiomyopathic mdx mice and persists through to the development an association are likely due to small sample size, variability in cardiac function analysis, clinical care and cardiac medications, and unverified consequences of the mutation on dystrophin transcript and/or protein (33-35). Patients with the same DMD genotype can show very different severity and age of onset of left ventricular dysfunction and, ultimately, survival (35). This confounds the interpretation of potential treatment-related effects. Although cardiomyopathy in the mdx mouse is relatively mild with late onset, this model has allowed us to investigate the mechanistic basis of metabolic dysfunction in the dystrophic heart and the consequences of partial restoration of a functional dystrophin. We have demonstrated that a long-term, low-dose PMO treatment regimen partially restores regulation of cardiac metabolic activity by I Ca-L (11). Based on the success of current long-term, 30 to 50 mg/kg/week PMO trials on improving ambulation and pulmonary function, and the knowledge that the half-life of dystrophin is shorter in cardiac versus skeletal muscle (22), we reasoned that a higher PMO dose may induce a higher level of skipping of dystrophin exon 23 and expression of functional dystrophin in the mdx heart. Initial studies indicated that treatment of precardiomyopathic mdx mice with a high PMO dose (120 mg/kg/week) for 3 weeks was sufficient to induce exon skipping and partially rescue alterations in J m and metabolic activity in response to activation of I Ca-L (Figure 1) (11). Based on these findings, we proposed that a long-term, high-dose treatment regimen would result in a more complete restoration of J m and metabolic activity. We find that administering precardiomyopathic mdx mice with 40 mg/kg PMO 3\u00c2 per week for 19 weeks induced exon skipping and expression of dystrophin in the heart (Figure 2), completely rescued alterations in J m and metabolic activity",

This study utilized the same PMO chemistry used in current clinical trials demonstrating that DMD patients receiving this treatment exhibit improved ambulation and stable pulmonary function(9,10). However, cardiac abnormalities consistent with the DMD phenotype remain in these patients. Based on our current findings, we propose that a long-term, high-dose PMO treatment regimen that commences prior to the development of cardiomyopathy may have the potential to concurrently improve ambulation, stabilize pulmonary function, and prevent cardiomyopathy in DMD patients.ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE: Dr. Livia C. Hool, Physiology M311, School of Human Sciences (Physiology), The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA, 6009, Australia. E-mail: livia.hool@uwa.edu.au. PERSPECTIVES COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Advances in respiratory care have resulted in an increase in life expectancy for DMD patients over the last half-century; however, this prolongation of life has been accompanied by an increasing number of patients suffering from an ultimately fatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Approximately 20% of DMD patient deaths result from dilated cardiomyopathy. Current clinical trials demonstrate that PMO therapy induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 and accumulation of functional dystrophin, and that these patients exhibit improved ambulation and stable pulmonary function; however, cardiac abnormalities remain. Effective therapy must be able to improve cardiac function and prevent ultimately fatal dilated cardiomyopathy without inducing toxicity. Utilizing the same PMO chemistry as current clinical trials, we have identified a nontoxic PMO treatment regimen to restore metabolic activity and prevent mdx cardiomyopathy. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The efficacy of a long-term, high-dose PMO treatment regimen in DMD patients will now need to be determined. We propose that a treatment regimen of this nature may have the potential to significantly improve morbidity and mortality from DMD because in addition to improving ambulation and stabilizing pulmonary function, the treatment will prevent the development of cardiomyopathy in DMD patients. with life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases can petition the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through their physicians to have expanded access (EA) to drugs that are in clinical trials but have not reached full FDA approval (the \"single-patient\" investigational new drug [IND] application). Additionally, recent state and federal laws-so-called \"right to try legislation\"-allow patients to approach drug companies directly for access prior to FDA approval. While these pathways provide potential access for individual patients to investigational drugs, different EA pathways permit entire groups of certain patients to access investigational drugs prior to FDA approval. This review focuses on special categories of EA INDs intended for multiple patients-the intermediate-group IND and the widespreadtreatment IND-as well as emergency authorization for use of investigational drugs and biological products (e.g., vaccines) in public health emergencies.

The IND filing provides the drug investigators with an exemption to the law prohibiting interstate transport of nonapproved drugs so that investigational substances can be distributed to researchers. It also launches FDA monitoring of in-human testing, through periodic reports, inspections, and audits throughout clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety in humans. Drug testing can begin 30 days after an IND filing unless the FDA objects. Thereafter, the average time for completion of all clinical trials is about 8 years (1,3).",

This review will focus on FDA EA for intermediate-sized groups of patients (the \"intermediate-sized IND\") and EA for entire classes of patients(the \"widespread treatment use\" IND), as well as emergency release of investigational drugs and biologics for use in public health emergencies. PITFALLS IN COMPASSIONATE USE Releasing investigational new drugs to individual patients who are facing certain death or disability seems to be a relatively uncomplicated decision, but allowing EA to entire groups of patients for treatment with an investigational new drug presents more complex regulatory, logistical, and ethical challenges for scientists, commercial entities, and the FDA. The current regulatory process from IND filing to drug approval has evolved and includes not only the FDA's historical primary mission of ensuring patient safety, but also, since the latter half of the 20th century, the newer mission of ensuring that marketed drugs are actually efficacious for their advertised/approved use. EA for a single patient may not present much of a challenge to the assertion that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks, because as presumably the patient requesting compassionate use faces an otherwise dismal clinical future, taking even significant risks with a new drug still presents potential benefits to a patient without other options. Early in a drug's regulatory pathway, however, it is not usually possible to ensure that a drug has a reasonable risk/benefit ratio for all patients, including those in the early stages of disease. Drug companies face bigger issues when the seeker of EA is a group of patients or an entire class of patients. Before marketing, manufacture of the drug for clinical studies is nearly an \"all cost\" proposition for the commercial entity; the drug cannot be marketed to cover its costs. Thus, companies generally only manufacture sufficient quantities (plus a small margin) to cover the requirements of clinical studies, rather than devote resources to manufacturing large quantities of a drug which has a <10% chance of ever making it to market (1,2). The FDA approval process begins with the filing of an investigational new drug (IND). Making the drug available to groups or classes of patients who might then deplete the supply of drug for clinical studies could compromise the very research that would more completely disclose a drug's risks and benefits; thus, it could possibly impede full market approval that would make the drug more widely available.",

Their experience does not necessarily apply to the entire patient population for which the drug is eventually targeted. An excess number of adverse outcomes in a compassionate use group could compromise marketing approval after clinical studies are complete. Finally, if the drug is made available to a large enough patient base prior to marketing approval, then what patients would be willing to subject themselves to placebo-controlled trials, in which they might not receive the active therapy? Patient recruitment for clinical studies could be compromised, which could slow or even prevent the clinical trials process for full drug approval. Such concerns are not merely theoretical, but have in fact caused significant controversy and potentially impeded the approval of some important medical treatments. than ganciclovir, the first compound discovered with activity against human cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can cause devastating disease in immunocompromised patients. In 1984, Syntex Corporation (later integrated into the Roche group) was engaged in animal studies of ganciclovir when a physician requested the drug under a compassionate use agreement with the FDA to treat a young mother dying of CMV pneumonia (8). Unfortunately, the woman died despite treatment. CMV infection was emerging as the cause of death in up to 30% of patients with AIDS, attacking the retina, lungs, liver, brain, spinal cord, and intestines, and only a few weeks later another physician requested compassionate use of ganciclovir in a 41-year-old man with advanced AIDS who was going blind from CMV retinitis. Based on this second patient's dramatic and quantifiable improvement, Syntex decided they had an ethical obligation to provide the drug when requested, and developed a written protocol setting criteria of documented immunocompromise and CMV infection that was an immediate threat to life or sight (8). In 1986, a series of 26 patients who received the drug under compassionate use was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, documenting the first effective treatment",

Eventually, the FDA and Syntex developed a research protocol involving patients with less severe, peripheral retinopathy, but no patients would enroll. An attempt was made to \"force\" patients to sign up by denying victims of early or less severe retinitis access to ganciclovir through compassionate use exemptions. These actions were met by a severe public backlash: doctors simply began declaring any patient with CMV retinitis as having a \"sight threatening\" condition, while patients refused enrollment in the clinical trial. AIDS advocates lobbied Congress for improved access to investigational drugs, and sit-ins began in protest. Ultimately, the FDA succumbed to public pressure and approved ganciclovir 5 years after its first in-human treatment use. Prior to ganciclovir, the FDA did have mechanisms by which they could approve the use of experimental drugs for individual patients; however, the struggle to approve ganciclovir and public advocacy during the AIDS epidemic had 2 critical effects on future drug approval processes: 1) a large patient advocacy group demonstrated its ability to move government regulations toward early access and streamlined drug approval; and 2) compassionate use was opened up for entire groups of patients, rather than being restricted to individuals. Regulations have evolved over the last 35 years, and now formalized pathways exist at the FDA that permit EA to intermediate patient groups and entire patient classes. FSA EXPANDED ACCESS PATHWAYS FOR GROUPS OF PATIENTS Within all INDs, there are 2 classifications: research and commercial INDs. The FDA defines a commercial IND as one in which either: 1) the sponsor is a corporate entity or is 1 of the institutes of the National Institutes of Health; or 2) if it is clear that the drug will eventually be commercialized. The IND is defined as a research IND if the drug is sponsored by an individual. Within each class of IND, commercial and research, there are subcategories of INDs, of which the most common is the \"investigator IND\"-in which the investigator initiates and conducts the studies and provides the immediate supervision of the drug's use. The FDA allowed individual patient EA as far back as the 1970s, but there were no specific pathways for such EA until the late 1980s, and even those were only codified in 2009. EA pathways at the FDA have undergone continual updates, the most recent of which was published in October of 2017 (14).At this time, EA of nonapproved drugs for treatment of more than 1 patient at a time is achievable only through the FDA, in contrast with access for individual patients, which technically can be legally obtained without the FDA by applying to the manufacturer directly(6). As with individual EA INDs, specific conditions for group patient access apply: 1) the patients must have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition with no comparable therapy or satisfactory alternative therapy;",

            "text": "An intermediate-size treatment IND is intended to provide EA to more than 1 patient at time, but generally to a smaller patient group than might, for example, be recruited for a clinical trial under an existing IND (15). A primary feature distinguishing an intermediate EA protocol from a clinical study under an existing IND is that an intermediate EA protocol is not primarily intended to obtain data or other information about a drug's safety or efficacy. Under an existing IND or protocol, EA can only be provided if the drug's sponsor is already actively pursuing marketing approval of the drug for the same use for which EA is being requested. However, other circumstances do allow EA if an existing treatment IND is not in place. EA can also occur: 1) when a drug has been withdrawn due to safety concerns, but there exists a patient group in which the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks; 2) use of a similar, unapproved drug (e.g., foreign-approved drug) is sought due to a shortage of the approved drug; 3) use of an approved drug where availability is limited due to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for diagnostic monitoring, or treatment purposes, but the use is sought by patients who cannot obtain the drug under such REMS (see the following section); or 4) \"other reasons\" approved by the FDA. Both intermediate-and widespread-treatment INDs can each be obtained through 2 types of regulatory submissions to the FDA: 1) as an EA protocol submitted as an amendment to a protocol in an existing IND; or 2) as a new IND submission that is separate and distinct from any existing IND, and is intended only for the purpose of making a drug available for treatment use (15). When there is an existing IND, the FDA usually encourages submission of an EA protocol under the existing IND to keep all EA use and clinical trials consolidated. This may simplify identification of safety issues, decrease the administrative burden to investigators and the FDA, and eventually help the review of the drug for approval. When there is no existing IND on a drug, or if the sponsor under an existing IND declines to sponsor the proposed EA, then a new treatment IND must be filed.",

A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk of a medication, whilestill allowing patients to have continued access to that medication. The FDA can require a REMS as a condition of approval of a new drug, or can demand a REMS if new safety issues arise regarding an already approved drug. The FDA can also require a REMS for an entire class of drugs. Because medications differ from one another, specific REMS for each medication are different from one another (17). might, for example, be: 1) to educate patients in how to monitor for specific types of infection that are associated with administration of a medication; 2) certification of health care providers to administer a drug that has a heightened risk of acute severe reaction; 3) periodic laboratory evaluation of the function of organs that may be at risk of damage from chronic administration of a medication; 4) a requirement for a negative pregnancy test prior to administration of a drug that has potential severe fetal adverse outcomes; 5) the establishment of a patient registry; and 6) \"other requirements.\" REMS protocols include details of the safety strategy, the plans for communication of the safety strategy to health care workers, details of such elements as certification of prescribing physicians, and a timetable for follow-up on outcomes of the REMS strategy. Other specific steps dealing with drug administration, such as provider or health care\u00c0setting certification, laboratory monitoring, patient monitoring, required patient follow-up visits, and the establishment of patient registries, are referred to as Elements to Assure Safe Use, or ETASU requirements (17).

Schardein observed that \"in approximately 10 strains of rats, 15 strains of mice, 11 breeds of rabbits, 2 breeds of dogs, 3 strains of hamsters, 8 species of primates,",

            "text": "Bioshield Legislation of 2004, the U.S. Congress created a separate class of authorization for release of investigational drugs and biologics (e.g., vaccines) for use in entire civilian populations in a declared public health emergency-the emergency use authorization (EUA) (29,30). Examples of such emergencies include epidemic outbreaks, bioterrorism attacks, chemical spills and attacks, and radiation and nuclear attacks. EUA is different from the emergency use of an investigational product under the EA program of the FDA, because an EUA requires the declaration of a public health emergency by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Homeland Security. They can then request an EUA to permit the use of unapproved investigational drugs, or unapproved uses of approved medical products. An FDA workgroup then takes into account the availability, safety, and efficacy of the drug or biologic, weighed against the communicability, morbidity, and mortality of the public health threat in deciding whether to release the treatment. EUA does not require documentation of individual informed consent, although information about the product must be provided to health care providers and individual patients (31). The process for approval of an EUA is summarized in Figure 1 (32). The first use of an EUA was in 2005, allowing the U.S. Department of Defense to provide anthrax vaccines to service members deployed in regions of the world subject to high threats for biological weapons. Other examples have included the use of diagnostic devices in the Zika outbreak of 2016. A significant regulatory shortcoming of the EUA is that it does not contain provisions to collect prospective outcome data during the use of the investigational drug or biologic, and limited retrospective reports provide very limited information for answering safety and efficacy questions in a substantiated way. EUAs also raise particular questions of what role, if any, investigational drugs should play in a communicable disease outbreak (33). Communicable diseases often present urgent needs by patients, because outbreaks are usually acute in nature, with high transmissibility and potentially high community morbidity and mortality. Determining benefits and risks of an investigational drug or biologic in the setting of a public health crisis involves a certain amount of duress on investigators, health care providers, and patients, with limited time for a considered decision. Thus, EUAs may not be appropriate for drugs that are in very early-phase testing, where reasonable risk/benefit ratios are almost entirely unknown, and a potentially large number of subjects will be exposed to the drug. With regard to benefits, infectious disease emergencies also carry a unique consideration: treatment of an index patient has potential to both benefit the individual, but also the community at large, by containing the outbreak. Conditions for which there are current EUAs in effect are listed in Table 1 (34). The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 to 2015 demonstrates some of the problems regarding release of investigational products on a population under duress. Over 1,700 people were sickened, and over 930 died. The World Health Organization knew of several vaccines and biologics that were in the pipeline to treat the Ebola virus, but none had been subjected to human studies, and the organization initially ruled out their use. Despite this, 2 U.S. citizens involved in epidemic response became ill with Ebola and were treated with an experimental mixture of monoclonal antibodies called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc. and LeafBio [San Diego, California], Defyrus Inc. [Toronto, Ontario, Canada], the U.S. government and the Public Health Agency of Canada",

Approval via the Animal Rule is usually subject to several conditions: 1) post-marketing \"field\" studies must verify and describe the product's clinical efficacy and safety when such studies are ethical and feasible; 2) restrictions may be imposed to ensure safe use only under the approved labelling (i.e., off-label use may be forbidden); and 3) information must be provided to patients prior to administration regarding the conditions of approval and directions for use, contraindications, foreseeable risks, adverse reactions, and drug interactions. The FDA provides guidance on product development under the Animal Rule, including general expectations and qualified animal models under FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research programs, as well as study design considerations (38). The guidance was not in place during the 2014 to 2015 West African Ebola virus outbreak. At that time, vaccines and drugs that were considered for use had not yet undergone human trials, and the quantities of these agents were not sufficient at the start of the epidemic to support human use. Currently, studies are underway of Ebola survivors (41,42). FDA INTERMEDIATE OR WIDESPREAD TREATMENT IND FILINGS EA INDs in the United States usually involve individual patients, rather than groups. In contrast with individual patient IND applications, which numbered between 322 and 1,110 annually between 2010 and 2016, intermediate EA IND submissions ranged between 0 and 50 annually (total \u00bc 171 over the entire period), and only 2 widespread treatment IND applications were filed during that same period. FDA refusals of EA INDs are uncommon, with a total of 10 intermediate IND refusals and zero widespread treatment IND refusals from 2010 through 2016 Supplemental Figure 1) (43). INTERMEDIATE VERSUS WIDESPREAD TREATMENT IND: WHICH IS THE APPROPRIATE PATHWAY? CONSOLIDATING MULTIPLE SINGLE-PATIENT EA INDs. When multiple individual patients are seeking EA to a particular drug and meet criteria for EA, the FDA encourages all individual applications to be consolidated under a single intermediate-sized IND or EA protocol, and that the commercial sponsor be the sponsor of the EA IND or EA protocol. This is to avoid having multiple single-patient INDs and multiple sponsors for a single investigational drug. That being said, regulations do not actually forbid authorizing more than 1 single-or intermediate-patient IND for the same drug. HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR AN INTERMEDIATE-SIZE EA INDs? The FDA generally considers the following factors when determining whether an intermediate-size EA IND or widespread treatment protocol is appropriate ((If the drug is not being developed for commercial use, and the sponsor seeking EA intends to treat more than 1 patient, then the FDA requires an intermediate-size EA IND or protocol. If, on the other hand, the drug is being developed for marketing for EA use, then a treatment IND or protocol, not intermediate-size IND or protocol, will be necessary.",

In some cases, the FDA will require transitioning of an intermediate-size EA IND or protocol to a treatment EA IND or protocol. This can occur when clinical evidence supports a treatment IND or protocol, when drug development has sufficiently progressed to warrant transition to a treatment IND or protocol, and when the sponsor is willing to make the drug available for the EA use to a larger patient population under a treatment IND or protocol. The FDA \"anticipates that there would ordinarily be a seamless transition from intermediatesize patient population expanded access to expanded access under a treatment IND or protocol\" (15), although this requires close coordination with the FDA review division overseeing the drug's development. THE FILING PROCESS Both intermediate and widespread treatment INDs require the submission of an EA application, which follows the same processes as an IND filing. The submission can be in the form of a new IND, or as a protocol amendment to an existing IND (4). As with regular INDs, commencement of treatment may begin within 30 days of FDA receipt of the application if the FDA does not object or place a clinical hold (1), or earlier if the FDA notifies that early treatment can begin.",

The FDA has long had mechanisms to approve \"compassionate use\" for individual patients, but more recently has developed expanded access pathways for groups and entire classes of patients to access investigational treatments or, if enrolled in a latephase clinical trial, to continue treatment with an investigational drug or biologic after clinical trials are concluded and the treatment awaits final FDA approval.

Experimentally, insulin exerts detrimental effects on the heart, vasculature, kidneys, and adipose tissue that can lead to heart failure. In both randomized clinical trials and observational studies, antihyperglycemic drugs that act through insulin signaling (i.e., sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and incretins) increase the risk or worsen the clinical course of heart failure, whereas drugs that ameliorate hyperinsulinemia and do not signal through insulin (i.e., metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors) reduce the risk of heart failure. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2018;3:415-9) \u00a9 2018 Published by Elsevier on behalf of the American College of Cardiology Foundation. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).T he primary aims of the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes are control of hyperglycemia and reduction in the risk of macrovascular and microvascular events. Historically, the definition of macrovascular events has generally focused on the occurrence of occlusive or thrombotic events in atherosclerotic vessels (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke, and major limb ischemia); however, heart failure is a common and serious complication of type 2 diabetes (1), and its occurrence cannot be explained by ischemic injury to the heart. Little is known about why heart failure is so common in patients with type 2 diabetes, evenwhen cardiovascular risk factors are well-controlled (Supplemental Appendix A). The most distinctive feature of type 2 diabetes is hyperinsulinemia. Insulin can exert important adverse effects on the heart, vasculature, kidneys, and adipose tissue, which can hasten the onset of heart failure or lead to worsening of its clinical course. Of interest, the phenotype of heart failure appears to differ in patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes, possibly because only the latter patients have sustained hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore, many antidiabetic drugs that work through the actions of insulin have been associated with an increased risk of heart failure and an increased mortality in patients with established symptoms (1). By contrast, antihyperglycemic drugs that do not depend on insulin signaling often reduce the risk of heart failure, and it is possible that their action to ameliorate hyperare ubiquitously expressed and are abundant in the heart and blood vessels. Interaction of insulin with its receptors leads to activation of 2 intracellular pathways: the Akt/mTOR signaling cascade and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-regulated kinase pathway. Experimentally, overexpression of Akt leads to pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and if sustained for long periods, to heart failure. A reduction of insulin or Akt signaling in murine models of cardiac hypertrophy prevents heart failure, suggesting that this mechanism contributes to adverse cardiac remodeling. At the same time, activation of the MAPK/extracellularregulated kinase pathway depresses cardiac contractility and enhances matrix remodeling, even in the absence of hypertrophy; it may also lead to the release of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to fibrosis. Either pathway (acting alone or in concert) might provide a molecular basis for an effect of insulin to cause heart failure (Supplemental Appendix B). Hyperinsulinemia may also have important effects on the structure and function of the vasculature. Although insulin signaling through the Akt pathway might be impaired in endothelial cells in states of insulin resistance, activation of MAPK signaling pathways remains active, resulting in the induction and potentiation of various endogenous vasoconstrictors. Additionally, insulin can contribute directly to vascular smooth muscle cell hyperplasia (Supplemental Appendix B). Insulin exerts a powerful antinatriuretic action, which may have evolved to counter the natriuresis caused by hyperglycemia. The infusion of insulin increases sodium reabsorption in the proximal and distal tubules, promotes the actions of angiotensin II, and inhibits the effects of endogenous natriuretic peptides. Insulin can directly increase activity of numerous ion transport mechanisms in the renal tubules, including the epithelial sodium channel, sodium-phosphate cotransporter, sodium-hydrogen exchanger type 3, and sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Supplemental Appendix B). Additionally, insulin promotes adipogenesis by facilitating the transition of mesenchymal cells into preadipocytes and by enhancing their differentiation into mature fat cells (Supplemental Appendix C). Such an action may be particularly important if it occurs in epicardial adipose tissue, which is characteristically hypertrophied in type 2 diabetes (2). The accumulation and dysfunction of epicardial adipose tissue causes the release of numerous proinflammatory adipocytokines, which can adversely affect the structure and function of the adjoining myocardium, with which it shares an unobstructed microcirculation. This inflammatory response may lead to microvascular rarefaction and cardiac fibrosis, both of which can impair ventricular distensibility. Insulin can also promote fibroblast proliferation in the myocardium and the secretion of collagen, further impairing the ability of the cardiac chambers to enlarge (Supplemental Appendix C). If the antinatriuretic action of insulin leads to plasma volume expansion, the net result is ventricular overfilling, which leads to the syndrome of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. This phenotype is particularly common in patients with type 2 diabetes.Insulin can therefore exert adverse effects on the heart, vasculature, kidneys, and adipose tissue, which (acting in concert) can lead to heart failure or accelerate the clinical course of the disease(Figure 1).CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF TYPES 1 AND 2 DIABETES ON HEART FAILUREIf insulin exerts adverse biological and pathophysiological effects that lead to heart failure, then the incidence of heart failure might be expected to differ in patients with type 1 versus type 2 diabetes because only the latter characteristically have sustained hyperinsulinemia (Supplemental Appendix D). In the only prospective study in type 1 diabetes that measured ventricular function and biomarkers of heart failure, the incidence of heart failure over a 7-year follow-up period was low, unless patients developed overt hypertension or coronary artery disease (3). In contrast, the incidence of heart failure is increased 2-to 3-fold in type 2 diabetes, and this risk cannot be readily attributed to known cardiovascular risk factors.Differences in the cardiac effects of types 1 and 2 diabetes have also been observed in animal models of the 2 diseases (Supplemental Appendix D). Rodent models of type 2 diabetes, including db/db mice, ob/ob mice, and Zucker diabetic fatty rats, exhibit notable degrees of ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, which is accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, abnormalities of calcium handling, and activation of neurohormonal systems. Echocardiographic studies reveal both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. In contrastAkita diabetic mice, do not exhibit cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, or oxidative stress; instead, the hearts of diabetic animals are smaller than in control animals, possibly because of the absence of insulin's effects on myocardial growth. CONTRASTING EFFECTS OF ANTIDIABETIC DRUGS ON THE RISK OF HEART FAILURE It is commonly believed that inadequate glycemic control increases the risk of heart failure in the clinical setting. The likelihood of heart failure increases as the level of glycated hemoglobin rises; yet, it is not clear whether this observation is explained by an adverse effect of hyperglycemia on the heart or is attributable to a deleterious action of the hyperinsulinemia that invariably accompanies hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes (Supplemental Appendix E). Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that pre-diabetes is associated with a striking increase in the risk of heart failure, despite only modest elevations of blood glucose. Hyperinsulinemia is also associated with poor outcomes following an acute myocardial infarction in patients without diabetes (4). Is the relationship between glycated hemoglobin and heart failure related to poor glycemic control and its adverse effects on cardiac energy utilization or metabolism? Alternatively, is the relationship between glycated hemoglobin and heart failure related to their shared association with hyperinsulinemia, which exerts direct detrimental effects on the circulation? These 2 possibilities can be distinguished by examining the effects of interventions that influence insulin levels and blood glucose in opposite directions (1). Two classes of medications exert an antihyperglycemic effect that is not dependent on insulin (Figure 1). Biguanides (such as metformin) decrease hepatic glucose production, mostly through inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory-chain complex 1 and activation of AMP kinase. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors promote glycosuria by an inhibitory effect on the proximal tubular reabsorption of glucose.",

(Bottom) Drugs that attenuate insulin signaling (metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 [SGLT2] inhibitors). By contrast, the majority of antihyperglycemic medications act by stimulating the release of or potentiating the actions of insulin (Figure 1). Insulin use is independently associated with an increased risk of heart failure, despite improved glycemic control (5). Thiazolidinediones promote insulin signaling by increasing the sensitivity of tissues to its metabolic actions. Both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone have been shown to increase the risk of heart failure in randomized controlled clinical trials.

These displays simulate depth similarly to head-mounted displays, by projecting a displaced image to each eye, controlled by either shutters or polarization in the glasses to provide the perception of depth. These displays can be used for navigating and interacting with medical images in a conventional office setting using a stylus for interaction (EchoPixel, Hewlett Packard's Zvr).

The primary advantage of these techniques is that they encode both the position of light and the angle, providing a more realistic image by recreating depth. True light field displays require much more computational capacity to render a point in space and generate the bundles of light necessary. The Avegant Light Field display (Belmont, California) is not yet commercially available and is not a true, full, light field display, but circumvents this complexity by accommodating a limited number of fixed focal depths. Displays of this type fundamentally trade spatial or temporal resolution in the viewing plane for resolution in the depth plane in addition to FOV of traditional stereo HMDs.

Holographic displays refer to interference-based holography, generated using a spatial light modulator (SLM) to create a hologram in space, at video framerates. The SLM shapes the incoming reference light to replicate the wave front that would originate from a real object at the appropriate position in 3D space, creating a true, multifocal, 3D hologram. This approach is being used by Realview to display 3D images of the heart (described in the previous text). The process of generating an interference pattern for a given 3D model and generating instructions for the SLM is computationally complex, but the resulting hologram best satisfies the requirements of the human visual system.

There are many different variants of waveguide-based displays (23), but all fundamentally rely on reflecting the output of a display through reflection to a view-through display in front of the user's eye.

The relatively uncomplicated design of the reflective half mirror, utilized by devices like the ODG R-9 (San Francisco, California), uses a single reflective half mirror and a reflector/ combiner, first developed for aircraft head-up displays.

The breadth and depth of interactions with these different display platforms have expanded as sensor and processing capabilities have improved, ranging from marker-free tracking to neural and voice inputs. The simplest form of interaction common to most HMDs is through the movement of the head, measured by accelerometers in the display. This angular movement updates the display based on the direction the head is pointing, and a display cursor representing the center of the user's focus is rendered in a fixed position relative to the display. This gaze cursor is usually rendered on the vertical midline of the display, although not necessarily in the center of the FOV depending on the manufacturer and ergonomics. If the gaze cursor is on an interactive element, such as a button, there are generally 2 methods of interaction with it. The first gaze-based interaction is referred to as gaze-dwell, and is triggered by holding the gaze cursor on the interactive element for an application-determined amount of time. If the HMD is equipped with internal or external hand tracking hardware, the user could also initiate activation of the interactive element using a recognized hand gesture, which in combination with gaze is referred to as a gaze-gesture command. In addition to these gaze-based commands, some displays can recognize more complex hand gesture or controller gesture commands by tracking the hand or a controller in the hand. Controllers have the added benefit of supporting physical buttons in place to further enhance interaction. Finally, most platforms support a microphone to support varying levels of voice command automation. Although gesture interaction offers a rich, efficient means to interact with the environment, voice and gaze-dwell inputs have the advantage of being hands-free, and controllers lose the advantage of being touch free. SENSORS. Compact inertial measurement units (IMUs), optical tracking, depth sensing cameras (Intel Real Sense, Microsoft Time of Flight) and voice recognition (Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana) provide the basis for navigation and control for most platforms. Most commercial VR displays use headsetmounted or external-fixed optical tracking (Optitrack, Corvallis, Oregon; Polaris, Medina, Minnesota; Scopis, Cambridge, Massachusetts) to provide accurate positioning and tracking within a volume, known as \"outside-in\" tracking (Figure 3, left). AR platforms may rely on the same optical tracking, or use onboard cameras to track fiducial markers within the environment. IMUs provide high-resolution angle and rate information for updating the view on screen, which is coupled with optical tracking information to provide correction updates to the tracking system, known as \"inside-out\" tracking (Figure 3, right). Network communications can provide access to highly trained voice recognition algorithms, or simpler local models can be used for specific commands. Near-eye pupil tracking (Pupil Labs, Berlin, Germany) cameras are available for simple tracking as an input device or as an enhancement to gesture input. Ultrasound arrays (Ultrahaptics, Bristol, England) can provide sterile haptic feedback through free air by using ultrasonic speakers to induce sensation on skin. This can help overcome the lack of haptic feedback when interacting with digital objects.CHALLENGESThe applicability of different modalities of extended reality to education, pre-procedural planning, intraprocedural guidance, and therapeutic use depends on their inherent advantages and limitations, particularly with respect to isolation from the natural physical environment. VR and MeR completely occlude the normal visual field, whereas AR and MxR enhance the visual field. This is most apparent when power is removed from the display; VR and MeR are completely opaque and must be removed to be able to see, whereas AR and MxR are transparent and only the digital additions are removed. VR, for example, can allow an individual student to interact in a fully immersive simulation, isolated from outside distraction. However, AR, MeR, and MxR will allow interventionalists to maintain presence in a physical room to perform procedures as well as maintain the ability to interact with the patient and cooperate with their supporting personnel. MeR platforms, however, present a potential safety risk during a procedure in the event of power loss, which would cause complete obstruction of the normal visual field.",

Outside-in optical systems use visual and time-of-flight cameras to track the relative angles to triangulate positions and poses of active or passive marker arrays mounted to the headset, controllers, and tools. Inside-out tracking systems track the relative angles, hands, tools, and landmarks to triangulate the position and pose of the headset relative to landmarks, and the position of hands and tools relative to the headset without any provide the most realistic, true holograms within close working distance, but still require large supporting systems tethered to the display, and have limited working volume. These CGH displays and others that compensate for VAC are well suited where near-field interaction between the digital and physical is critical (e.g., projection of pre-procedural imagery onto a surgical field). Systems that cannot simulate accommodation can avoid discomfort by placing digital objects farther away, where the HVS is less sensitive to disparity in accommodation. Platforms utilizing external optical tracking achieve consistent tracking volumes but require additional equipment and clear lines of sight between cameras and devices, which increases initial installation and maintenance complexity. Mobile AR platforms with inside-out tracking of both position and gestures provide the most flexible platforms for intraprocedural use, and can mitigate VAC through careful placement of digital objects.CONCLUSIONS Rapid hardware advances driven by the revolution in mobile computing have finally brought devices that are tractable for medical applications into existence.",

These qualities include intelligence, investment in training, judgment, and of course the sine qua non: hard work.For the laboratory-based physician-investigator, maintaining clinical contact can heighten appreciation of the talents and dedication of their more clinically-oriented colleagues. Taking a turn in caring for hospitalized patients keeps the laboratory-based partner in touch with the problems posed by patients in actual practice. As opposed to the laboratory world, the care of patients involves making decisions and judgments in the absence of precise prior information, rigorous controls, or abundant data that apply directly to the patient in front of them. While the practitioner has clinical guidelines and the results of trials as touchstones, in actual practice the individual face-to-face with the physician often does not meet the entry criteria for the pivotal clinical trials, and each patient's care requires a good deal of individual judgment. For the laboratory-based physician, confronting the uncertainties and ambiguities of actual practice can foster humility and also engender deep respect for the seasoned clinician and clinical investigator whose partnership proves essential to enable effective translation. Beyond mutual respect, a shared language can facilitate translational partnerships. Often more clinically-oriented partners in translational relationships have trained in some aspect of more fundamental research. Individuals who have spent some time grappling with the delayed gratification common in the laboratory can appreciate better the travails of the experimental investigator. In addition, an acquaintance with the concepts involved in research beyond that which can be gleaned from textbooks provides a common language: a Rosetta stone that facilitates communication in translational partnerships. In addition, institutional culture can catalyze translational research. Leadership that fosters, enables, and rewards partnerships along the lines described above can stimulate and sustain the types of interactions that enable success in translational research. In many great institutions, a cultural divide exists between the clinically-oriented faculty and those engaged in basic research. Such a \"twin tower\" environment can present a barrier to the very types of interactions that cultivate effective translation. Leadership that values contributors along the entire spectrum of translation from the most fundamental through to master clinicians can inspire the types of interactions that kindle success in translation. An environment that encourages laboratory researchers to attend clinical conference and participate actively can enhance the likelihood of successful translation. Including in clinical conferences laboratory-oriented individuals who can communicate the concepts of their basic science findings clearly and understandably to more clinically-oriented individuals and trainees can nurture the culture of cooperation in translation. Many laboratory-based investigators do not appreciate the extent of the inner workings of largescale clinical trials. Such investigations are delicate, intricate, and arduous undertakings that involve multiple trade-offs and compromises foreign to the formulation of laboratory experiments. Clinical trials require incredible dedication and effort for successful completion. The clinical trialist lacks the ability to repeat an experiment, a luxury available in the laboratory environment. While successful clinical trials entail many mechanical aspects which must perform correctly for success, the judgment and scientific discernment of the clinical trialist also participates pivotally in the design, execution, analysis, and mining of the data from clinical trials. On the other hand, input from the more laboratory-based investigators can contribute to the design and interpretation of trials. Input from the laboratory investigator can help prioritize subsidiary analyses and provide advice regarding what biomarkers or genetic studies would enable the most productive use of the biobanks and databases acquired by contemporary large-scale clinical trials. The remarks above provide some personal observations regarding the value of partnerships in maximizing opportunities for translational advances within academic institutions. \"Vertical\" partnerships provide another key to successful translation. The best academic-industrial partnerships maximize the opportunities afforded by interlocking skill sets, strengths, expertise, and platforms (Figure 1). Academic investigators excel at defining biological pathways that can identify new targets for therapeutics as well as enlightening understanding of the pathogenesis of disease. Yet potential targets lie fallow without the application of skillful medicinal chemistry, access to compound libraries, or biological agent development to generate therapeutics based on the targets identified in academic research. High-throughput screening with large libraries and robotic technology most often exceed the resources of any single academic laboratory and many academic institutions. The medicinal chemistry and high-throughput screens of compound libraries, as well as the development of biological agents, represent strengths of industry that complement discovery research conducted in the academic laboratory. The design of preclinical \"proof-of-concept\" studies can benefit enormously from input from academic investigators. The choice of target populations, biomarkers, and surrogate endpoints in early clinical development thrives when true partnership of industry-can help to avoid some of the pitfalls of early clinical development. Such challenges commonly include issues related to dosing, enrollment criteria, and the choice of outcome measures. The conduct of toxicology studies for new chemical entities in drug development not only lies outside the expertise and resources available to academic investigators, but also does not provide a fertile field for training in academic laboratories. This consideration limits the appropriateness of involvement of students or fellows in such projects in academic laboratories. Yet, toxicology studies including in vitro mutagenesis and animal toxicity studies must precede bringing a compound into the clinic. These undertakings lie well within the expertise and resources of the industrial partner, and illustrate the necessity of joining the interlocking expertises of academia and industry to achieve effective translation. The design and execution of clinical trials at its best involves a balletic coordination between academic investigators and the pharmaceutical sponsor. As in earlier clinical development, a great deal of discernment and judgment can maximize the possibility of obtaining a clear answer from a clinical trial. Collaboration between academic and industrial statisticians can help assure the most rigorous approach to the all-important development of the trial protocol, choice of endpoints, dosages for study, and the allimportant statistical analysis plan. The tension between resources allocated by the sponsor to the trial and the academic partner's interest in maximizing power (for example, for subsidiary, subgroup, or exploratory analyses beyond the primary endpoint) provides another example of the intricacy and importance of the partnership between academia and industry. Of course, academic-industry partnerships in development of novel therapies and their translation to the clinic require safeguards. There must be transparency regarding financial relationships between academic investigators and industry. The right of the academic investigators to publish even negative data or possible adverse effects requires rigorous preservation. Academic investigators should have a duplicate of the database of clinical trials and have access to the biobanks generated during the investigation. Academic investigators should have the ability to perform independent statistical analyses of the study database. The steering committees of clinical trials and the data and safety monitoring board must have sufficient independence to assure the rigor of the conduct of an analysis of a trial and protect the participants. Many look askance at partnerships between academic investigators and their institutions and the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry. I argue that such partnerships not only enable or speed translation, but can actually provide substantial societal benefit by enhancing the public health. With adequate safeguards, partnerships between academia and industry can hasten the development of novel therapies and also provide pathways for the development of careers of physician investigators. The rich databases generated by contemporary clinical trials not only inform the primary endpoint, but should give rise to many subsidiary analyses which prove hypothesis-generating, and can provide mechanistic insight or increased knowledge of pathophysiology. Thus, both horizontal and vertical partnerships can help promote translational medicine. Like many human enterprises, these partnerships require considerable care and curation. Yet, at the end of the day they help to increase human knowledge and understanding of disease, and provide advances in clinical care that can alleviate suffering and prolong life.",

In this study, lung BH 4 levels were lower in SHR than in age-matched WKY, consistent with published reports (46). Following a short-term oral dose (4 h) or long-term daily (8 weeks) L-phe challenge, tissue BH 4 levels in SHR were restored to control WKY levels.Correspondingly, we observed increased aortic superoxide production in SHR basally and L-phe administration increased aortic BH 4 and concomitantly reduced superoxide levels. These data support the hypothesis that L-phe activates the GCH1-GFRP complex in vivo, raising endogenous BH 4 biosynthesis to support full \"coupled\" NOS activity, thereby reducing oxidative stress in this model of hypertension. Limited BH 4 bioavailability is believed to lead to NOS uncoupling, generating superoxide instead of NO (8,47). In SHR, the observed endothelial dysfunction is, in part, a result of eNOS uncoupling attributed to BH 4 insufficiency and NO scavenging by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (48-50). Interestingly, in this study, L-phe caused a more sustained increase of plasma nitrite in SHR compared with WKY. This unexpected, but welcome, observation may be explained by an exaggerated improvement from a short-term surge in BH 4 in the already compromised SHR. In other words, the spike in BH 4 following L-phe dosing may have temporarily \"recoupled\" NOS and elicited further direct antioxidant effects on other ROS, thereby greatly enhancing NO and hence nitrite levels. By contrast, WKY should not have BH 4 insufficiency and should have \"fully coupled\" eNOS. Hence, the short-term effects of BH 4 elevation on nitrite should be less pronounced. Further mechanistic studies would be required to confirm this suggestion.",

To rule out the influence of prostaglandins on vascular relaxation, indomethacin was employed throughout these studies. BH 4 is highly unstable and can be rapidly oxidized to BH 2 . Previously, studies have demonstrated that BH 2 can itself bind to the BH 4 binding site on NOS but does not confer any cofactor functionality. Thus, raised BH 2 can be problematic, competing with BH 4for the NOS binding site and promoting NOS uncoupling.

It is therefore noteworthy that the use of metformin has been reported to decrease the risk of heart failure in observational studies, although evidence from clinical trials is lacking. Similarly, in large-scale randomized controlled trials, long-term treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors has been shown to reduce the risk of newonset heart failure as well as hospitalization and death from heart failure (Supplemental Appendix F). The mechanisms by which metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors may act on heart failure have not been clearly defined. Through its action on AMP kinase, metformin orchestrates a metabolic response that preserves myocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP); it also has antiproliferative, antifibrotic, and antiapoptotic properties that may contribute to favorable effects on cardiac remodeling. The drug also inhibits adipocyte differentiation and adipose tissue inflammation, thereby potentially minimizing the ability of diabetes-related derangements of epicardial adipose tissue biology that cause microvascular rarefaction, cardiac fibrosis, and impaired ventricular distensibility. SGLT2 inhibitors have also been shown to inhibit the accumulation and inflammation of epicardial fat in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors may inhibit the deleterious effect of sodium-hydrogen exchanger activation in the myocardium and in the kidney, thus leading to cardioprotection and natriuresis (Supplemental Appendix F). Because insulin itself exerts detrimental effects of insulin on the heart, vasculature, and kidneys, however, it is possible that the benefits of both biguanides and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of heart failure may (in part) be related to their shared ability to reduce hyperinsulinemia.",

Sulfonylureas are insulin secretagogues as a result of their action to inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, and their use has been associated with an increased risk of heart failure that is comparable to that seen with thiazolidinediones (Supplemental Appendix G). The mechanisms by which these drugs exert their deleterious effects on the clinical course of heart failure are unknown. The action of sulfonylureas to inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel may interfere with an important endogenous compensatory mechanism that serves to reduce calcium overload during periods of stress. Both GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to augment cyclic AMP and potentiate adrenergic mechanisms, both of which may exacerbate heart failure. Furthermore, signaling through the GLP-1 receptor can promote inflammation in adipose tissue, which may explain why the use of DPP4 inhibitors promotes cardiac fibrosis in diabetes, predisposing to the development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. Although thiazolidinediones can ameliorate adipose tissue inflammation, both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone exert deleterious effects on the clinical course of heart failure because of their action to promote sodium reabsorption in the renal tubules. In experimental studies, thiazolidinediones exert their sodium-retentive effects (in part) by enhancing insulin signaling in the renal tubules; in clinical studies, the risk of heart failure produced by these drugs is increased by concomitant treatment with insulin. For many antihyperglycemic drugs, therefore, an increase in insulin signaling may exacerbate other deleterious effects of these drugs or may supersede potentially favorable effects on the heart. Interestingly, drugs that signal through insulin are often associated with weight gain; in clinical trials, such weight gain is accompanied by an increased risk of heart failure, even if glycemic control is improved (Supplemental Appendix G). If insulin signaling exerts adverse effects to increase the risk of heart failure in patients with diabetes without overt symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction, then the same mechanism would also be expected to worsen the clinical course of patients with diabetes who have established heart failure. It is therefore noteworthy that, in several observational studies, patients with chronic heart failure who had levels of glycated hemoglobin #7.0% had a worse survival than those with levels of 7.0% to 8.0%, even after adjustment for other predictors of a poor outcome. Importantly, that this relationship was observed only in patients whose diabetes was treated with drugs, not in those who were managed only with diet. This finding suggests that the poor survival of patients with heart failure with a glycated hemoglobin #7.0% may have been related to the use of antihyperglycemic medications. The drugs used to intensify glycemic control in these studies (insulin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones) acted through insulin signaling (Supplemental Appendix H). A",

Of importance, antihyperglycemic drugs that act through insulin signaling appear to consistently increase the risk of heart failure, whereas drugs that ameliorate hyperinsulinemia have been shown to reduce the onset and progression of heart failure. In patients with diabetes and established heart failure, intensive glycemic control with insulin-dependent therapeutic regimens is associated with an increased risk of death.

Silva, MD, a,b Michael Southworth, MS, b Constantine Raptis, MD, c Jonathan Silva, PHD bRecently, rapid development in the mobile computing arena has allowed extended reality technologies to achieve performance levels that remove longstanding barriers to medical adoption. Importantly, head-mounted displays have become untethered and are light enough to be worn for extended periods of time, see-through displays allow the user to remain in his or her environment while interacting with digital content, and processing power has allowed displays to keep up with human perception to prevent motion sickness. Across cardiology, many groups are taking advantage of these advances for education, pre-procedural planning, intraprocedural visualization, and patient rehabilitation. Here,we detail these applications and the advances that have made them possible. (J Am Coll Cardiol Basic Trans Science 2018;3:420-30) \u00a9 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier on behalf of the American College of Cardiology Foundation. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).F or many years, extended reality technologies have promised physicians the ability to move beyond 2-dimensional (2D) screens, allowing them to understand organ anatomy in 3-dimensions (3D) noninvasively. However, this promise has been stymied by bulky equipment that was incapable of displaying high-quality virtual images coherently enough to prevent user motion sickness. Recent advances in high-resolution display technology, exponential increases in computational power, and miniaturization of components led by mobile device manufacturers have enabled a new class of head mounted display (HMD) devices (1). These low-cost, comfortably-worn devices can display high-quality clinical data at response times that are fast enough to be used for extended periods of time, overcoming longstanding barriers to adoption in the medical community. Advances in digital light projection, organic light emitting diode, and optics manufacturing have resulted in thinner, lower-power, and brighter display systems (2). Speech recognition and generation advancements brought the earliest forms of augmented aural reality; the online digital assistant now known as Siri (Apple, Cupertino, California) or Google's assistant (Google, Mountain View, California) are in use daily, along with automated transcription systems. Sensor technology advancements in positioning and navigation systems originally designed to function with the global positioning system have been extended to include satellite-free indoor navigation, tracking user position via their mobile device by leveraging software and hardware such as Project Tango and ARCore (Google) or ARKit (Apple). Eye and hand tracking provides new human machine input capabilities for understanding natural intent with less burden on the user to understand the language of a specific manufacturer. This combination of hardware and software innovation has enabled new classes of 3D platforms. Based on these advances in 3D platforms, the number of clinical applications has grown exponentially in the areas of education, pre-procedural planning, rehabilitation, and even intraprocedural visualization. Here, we focus on the application of virtual reality (VR) and related technology for clinical cardiac practice, focusing on what is possible based on current technology and what barriers still exist for widespread adoption. Extended reality describes the spectrum, or \"virtuality continuum\" (3) from fully immersive, curated digital experiences in VR, to unobtrusive annotations within easy access of the operator in augmented reality (AR) (Table 1). It encompasses 2D annotations on real-time video, 3D models, and true interferencebased holograms, like animated versions of those seen on baseball cards. Although most headsets refer to their models as \"holograms,\" HMDs typically create the perception of depth for 3D models through stereoscopy, simulating depth without generating true holograms. VR provides complete control over the wearer's visual and auditory experience as they interact within a completely synthetic environment. This control over the environment can provide virtual experiences of either subdued or amplified versions of reality. Commercially available VR platforms from Oculus, HTC, and Sony, among others, use high-resolution displays to fully replace the wearer's visual field. Conversely, AR allows the wearer to see their native environment while placing 2D or 3D images within it through a \"window-on-the-world\" (3). This annotated window-on-the-world can be displayed on an unobtrusive HMD or on a mobile device, using the onboard camera to provide a live view of the environment. Perhaps the most successful consumer application of AR technology has been Pok\u00e9mon Go (7) in which a mobile phone camera feed was annotated with avatars and contextual game data. These AR applications minimally interfere with the normal field of vision, providing useful information only when called upon by the user. In the medical setting, contextually relevant graphics, reference data, or vital information is presented alongside (rather than in place of) the physical surroundings. The first, and most widely publicized commercial platform, Google Glass for example, was shown to display patient vital signs, relevant history, and prescription information from a patient's electronic health record during a visit (8). VR and AR denote the 2 bookends of the continuum of experiences, and as the industry has grown, 2 new classes of experiences have emerged: merged reality (MeR) and mixed reality (MxR). Both approaches achieve a similar experience: to allow for interaction with digital objects while preserving a sense of presence within the true physical environment. MeR captures a user's surroundings and re-projects them onto on a VR-class HMD, which can mediate the environment up or down as desired. This allows for a more seamless transition between mediated and unmediated virtuality and reality. For consumers, this is portrayed as the ability to transport users to a completely different room and back to their living room with the same device (Intel Alloy [11]), which could also be applied to patients in hospital rooms. MxR accomplishes a similar experience by projecting digital objects onto a semitransparent display. As such, the MxR platforms do not obscure, or mediate, the physical environment, allowing the wearer to maintain situational awareness of their surroundings as well as maintain normal interactions with those not participating in the MxR experience. This advance has opened a window of opportunity for this type of technology for intraprocedural use, allowing physicians to remain in their environment while viewing the virtual image (Central Illustration). Currently, MxR displays commercialized by Microsoft and DAQRI (Los Angeles, California) have been demonstrated in medical education and medical imaging (12). Several additional prominent 3D display platforms have been developed without using an HMD, including 3D flat-panel displays, and interferencebased computer-generated holography. Flat-panel 3D displays, first introduced in 2010 (13), were primarily displays only and lacked input devices for",

Hewlett Packard's (Palo Alto, California) Zvr 3D display and input device is used in conjunction with EchoPixel's (Mountain View, California) software to provide diagnostic quality images(14). A second example, computer interference-based holography, generates realistic 3D images by shaping light waves using a combination of complex processing, specialized computer-controlled light sources, and optics. Although real-time display of holograms was first demonstrated in 1992 (15), recent advances by RealView imaging have enabled their practical use, and they have explored several clinical applications using this technology, including cardiology(16,17).Various cardiac applications of virtual reality are depicted inFigure 1.EDUCATION. Extended reality provides a wide range of possibilities for educational and training applications. Some applications leverage the immersion that VR enables to simulate the entire operating environment along with the educational material. Another class of applications brings the existing medical simulations for tablets and mobile phones to VR as the next platform that trainees will have access to. These VR-use cases are generally available across most consumer VR platforms. Other applications take advantage of the presence of MxR to allow multiple wearers to interact and discuss with each other while viewing the same educational material in a natural environment. These applications rely on the view through nature of MxR, combined with the freedom of untethered headsets to walk around and communicate naturally. S t a n f o r d v i r t u a l h e a r t . The Stanford Virtual Heart Project (18), working with Lighthaus, Inc., uses an immersive VR headset for educational purposes. This project has a few distinct arms. The first is geared at patient and family education to help families better understand their child's cardiac anatomy, which is currently limited to drawings and plastic models. This improved depth of understanding should help parents better participate in their child's complex medical care. This application has been expanded to Stanford medical students and trainees, who can visualize normal and abnormal anatomies and understand how congenital anomalies affect physiology. Using a fully immersive VR headset, the students can inspect, manipulate, and walk through the models, providing a more complete understanding of the anatomy and physiology. A library of approximately 2 dozen common congenital lesions is available to the trainees. The aim of these experiences is to provide a deeper anatomic understanding of these lesions, improving the understanding and speed of learning of these complex abnormal physiologies and hemodynamic sequelae. The final application is the use of a 3D monitor, Echopixel (as discussed later in the section \"Pre-Procedural Planning\"), in the cardiothoracic operating room. A 3D workstation in the surgical suite may allow for accurate assessments of intracardiac anatomy and geometry, which may be difficult to see after patients are placed onto cardiopulmonary bypass and the heart is decompressed.H o l o A n a t o m y . At Case Western Reserve University, investigators are using the HoloLens (Microsoft) to change medical student education, particularly anatomy (19). The ability to better understand 3D anatomic relationships not only eases the learning curve, but also encourages students to \"think like a doctor.\" In conjunction with the Cleveland Clinic, the team at Case Western Reserve University is developing a curriculum, HoloAnatomy, that will allow medical students to perform holographic dissections to better visualize and understand the body's organs and systems. Preview versions of this software are freely available to download. PRE-PROCEDURAL PLANNING. E c h o P i x e l . One of the first 3D displays to gain approval from the U.S.Food and Drug Administration is the True 3D system that has been developed by Echopixel, which is integrated into a diagnostic grade DICOM workstation.The system provides 3D visualization using a technique similar to that used in 3D movie theaters and early 3D consumer televisions: by providing different images to each eye using specialized glasses. A single Echopixel user wearing polarized glasses can additionally manipulate the onscreen image using a handheld wand. Initial cardiology studies include using the Echopixel system to visualize arteries in patients with pulmonary atresia with major aortopulmonary collateral arteries. In this study",

Although improvements in visualization have been a source of research and development over the years, there have not been equal gains in improvements in interaction. Our prototype, the Enhanced not only empowers the interventional electrophysiologist to visualize patient-specific 3D cardiac geometry with real-time catheter locations, but also allows direct control of the display without breaking sterility, which is a key advance (21). ELVIS can display data that is exported from an EAMS or that is obtained pre-procedurally via computed tomography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. To date, we have connected ELVIS to the EnSite Velocity EAMS (Abbott, Abbott Park, Illinois) via the CoHesion module to display electroanatomic data, including cardiac geometry, catheter localization data, and electroanatomic maps, including local activation time and voltage maps. Most recently, we have demonstrated the ability to display historical cases for review, as well as a live case observed in real-time from the control room. In addition to the ability to improve visualization, the system allows the user to utilize gesture, gaze, or voice control for sterile control of the display. This improved interaction allows the interventionalist to directly control this single cohesive model in manner that is optimal for a given procedure. Sharing functionality provides a single shared cardiac holographic model for as many as 5 users with the model remaining fixed in the room, allowing all users to visualize the model from their vantage points. Using the sharing system, there is a single person in control of the system at any given time with the ability to pass controller privileges to other users. Supplemental Video 1 demonstrates the current functionality of the prototype, including sharing, gesture control, and the display of intracardiac geometry and catheter movement that were obtained from the EnSite system. R e a l v i e w . In 2016, the pediatric cardiology group at Schneider's Children's Medical Center partnered with Realview Medical Imaging (Yokneam, Israel) to assess the feasibility of creating real-time 3D digital holograms in a standard cardiac catheterization laboratory (16). The Realview computer-generated holography (CGH) were created using 3D rotational angiography coupled with 3D transesophageal echocardiography. A total of 8 patients were enrolled in this study, including patients with structural heart disease and post-operative cardiac patients. In all patients, the team generated real-time 3D holograms with high accuracy (as measured by instructing 4 independent observers to identify anatomic landmarks within the hologram and typical cardiac imaging) with \"very easy\" interactions including image marking, cropping, zoom, rotation, movement of hologram, and slicing. This is the first study of its kind to demonstrate feasibility within the cardiac catheterization laboratory.",

MindMaze (San Francisco, California) is creating both hardware and software in the VR space with a current medical application in neurorehabilitation. Their current solution, MindMotion PRO, is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in post-stroke patients, combining virtual reality, brain imaging, and gaming technologies to retrain the brain to improve upper limb mobility. In acute post-stroke patients, a clinical study has enrolled patients who engage in 20-to 30-min sessions as soon as 4 days posthospitalization without continuous supervision, with increasing training intensity over time (22). All patients had a positive user experience using the MindMotion PRO, with 90% reporting an improvement in movement capacity (22). Significant advances in extended reality devices have enabled the previously mentioned applications, yet the technology continues to evolve rapidly. In the following text, we describe currently available systems and future devices that will certainly expand the number of opportunities for extended realities to improve patient care. DISPLAYS. Typical displays project either a single coherent image to 1 or both eyes as a near-eye display, or in a stereoscopic pair for 3D simulation. Monocular systems are either opaque or view through, and avoid disruption of normal vision by positioning a small display outside of the normal working visual field.",

A display system that achieves this angular resolution contains pixels that are considered indistinguishable, commonly referred to by Apple as a Retina Display.This equates to a roughly 9,000 by 8,100 pixel/eye requirement to fully emulate and immerse the human visual system. By comparison, 4K HMD displays contain 3,840 \u00c2 2,160 pixels and commonly require workstation class graphics for processing. Understandably, this resolution and FOV is currently not economically feasible with current optics and display technologies. As a result, device manufacturers compromise FOV, pixel density, and display brightness to achieve the optimum capabilities for a given application (Table 2). Cost, size, weight, and power will only decrease as technology advances, as demonstrated by the recent release of the Apple iPhone X(27), which contains miniaturized, lowerpower versions of the depth sensors, IMU, and processing required for advanced, handheld AR.",
