However, we dispute the conclusions of Peter Sever and colleagues (April 5, p 1149) 1 about the beneficial effects of atorvastatin as presented in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA). As Lars Lindholm and Ola Samuelsson report in the accompanying Commentary (p 1144), 2 the additional benefit of lipid-lowering treatment upon antihypertensive treatment was rather low in ASCOT-LLA.",

One explanation for this finding could be that in ALLHAT-LLT, almost 50% of the participants were women and a high proportion of patients in the control group used statins. The ASCOT investigators argue that the number of events among women and participants with diabetes was too small, because of the inadequate power of the study. However, we doubt the usefulness of lipid-lowering treatment in a population of women with such a low incidence of cardiovascular events (36 for almost 6500 patient-years).",

            "text": "The reason why atorvastatin did not show a similar beneficial effect to simvastatin or pravastatin might be found in the low dose of atorvastatin used in ASCOT-LLA. A higher dose might have shown better results. But there is also a substantial difference in the biochemical structure of the different statins. Lovastatin and pravastatin are natural statins of fungal origin, whereas simvastatin is a semisynthetic derivative of lovastatin. Atorvastatin and fluvastatin are fully synthetic statins. 4 In addition, Cromwell and Ziajka 5 found that the long-term use of atorvastatin led to tachyphylaxis (a decreasing response to a physiologically active agent), which resulted in an increase of LDL cholesterol over time despite optimum treatment. By contrast, all other statins showed no evidence of tachyphylaxis. 5 Atorvastatin offers no additional benefit above antihypertensive treatment for the reduction of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in women, patients with diabetes, and those with left-ventricular hypertrophy or previous vascular disease-and all this without affecting mortality.",

Booth and colleagues 2 only used steroids in 40% of the patients, less than half of whom received them during the first 48 h.
