Others, such as the current novel H1N1 pandemic, threaten entire nations. Typically, communities lack the POCT resources necessary to effectively handle the disaster situations they face. 1 Conversely, newdemics highlight the significant potential for POCT to positively impact preparedness, disaster response, and patient outcomes. Current experiences, including the surprise appearance of the novel H1N1 pandemic in Mexico (unpublished observation), emphasize the need for new sturdy, handheld, and robust POC technologies capable of effectively operating in a variety of field locations.",

The respondents included 8 physicians (32%), 9 public health officials/hospital managers (36%), 3 pathologists (12%), and 5 emergency room doctors (20%). given clinical settings. The results showed that in disaster settings, respondents showed a significant preference for handheld diagnostics (Fig. 2 ) and cited increased portability and versatility as the rationale. When respondents were asked to choose between a device that tests multiple patient samples in parallel for a single pathogen versus a device that performs multiplex testing of several pathogens for a single patient sample (Fig. 3) , respondents preferred a multiplex test in the urgent care and emergency room settings (Fig. 4) . Participants cited the need to quickly screen a large volume of patients in a disaster setting, whereas a full workup is necessary in urgent care and emergency room settings. Several of the respondents who chose the device that parallel processes multiple patient samples for a single pathogen given a disaster setting, referenced biothreat or pandemic scenarios. Fig. 5 shows 2 different sample collection methods, a test cassette and vacutainer.

During Hurricane Katrina, a variety of different locations and types of POCT were used featuring an array of POC tests covering chemistry, hematology, and other analyte categories. Fig. 9 highlights POC instruments, including the various locations and POCT operators in Hurricane Katrina. Hospitals, evacuation sites, and local agencies were not prepared for the disaster and offered few POCT devices and tests. Hurricane Katrina is an example of a newdemic. 5 Supplies depleted quickly. Needs for chronic monitoring, such as outpatient glucose monitoring, were not met. Fig. 10 displays Hurricane Katrina disaster sites, arrival, and responses of mostly military assets, and a suggested optimal POCT plan (upper right in figure) for timely disaster response. Fig. 10 also documents that the disaster response time was slow. Current POCT disaster preparation does not meet adequate standards and must be improved for future preparedness. Proper strategic placement of POCT, possibly in alternate medical care facilities, is needed to facilitate rapid diagnosis and treatment. 33 Pandemic influenza strains, such as novel H1N1, have the potential to significantly increase mortality and morbidity, as well as quickly deplete resources of current health care infrastructures. Thus, for example, rapidly diagnosing a particular influenza strain using POCT devices is advantageous. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends the use of POCT devices for quick influenza diagnosis. Commercially available POC tests for influenza A and B are listed in Table 4 .

These NAR devices exhibit greater sensitivity and can provide subtyping data. Once a subtype of influenza is positively identified, health care personnel and public health workers have the ability to start surveillance of new strains in a particular area. In addition, subtyping of influenza has the ability to guide antiviral treatment by identifying particular influenza strains that may be resistant or sensitive to antiviral treatment. For instance, several H1N1 strains of influenza were resistant to oseltamivir in fall 2008; however, in spring 2009, the novel H1N1 influenza strain (''swine flu'') was sensitive to oseltamivir. Furthermore, in a recent study conducted by Dr Nishiura and colleagues, 39 the use of quarantine and rapid diagnostic testing to prevent or delay the spread of pandemic influenza across island nations was evaluated. In order for quarantine strategy to be effective in preventing or delaying the spread of pandemic influenza, rapid and reliable diagnostic testing must be used to positively identify index cases (first victims) with influenza. 39 Thus, the use of POCT to rapidly diagnose and subtype influenza has significant potential to refine pandemic disaster response and prevent newdemics from spreading outside the bounds of initial disaster or emergency locations.",

Donations of glucose meters proved valuable, but not fast enough or adequate for the large numbers of diabetic victims involved in the disaster. POC tests used during the disaster include: ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; aPTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; BUN, blood (serum) urea nitrogen; CK, creatine kinase; cTn, cardiac troponin; GGT, g-glutamyltransferase; Hb, hemoglobin; Hct, hematocrit; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; INR, international normalized ratio; LD, lactate dehydrogenase; MB, MB fraction of CK; PT, prothrombin time; SO 2 , oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry; TCO 2 , total carbon dioxide content; TP, total protein.Instrument identifications: Bayer Acsensia, http://www.bayercarediabetes.com; Cardiac STATus, http://www.spectraldx.com; Cell-Dyn, http://www.abbottdiagnostics.com; i-STAT, http://www.i-stat.com; Ortho Diagnostics blood typing, http://www.orthoclinical.com; Piccolo, http://www.abaxis.com; Rapidpoint coag, http://www.bayer-poct.co.uk; and Triage, http://www.biosite.com.
