Therapeutic implementation, however, has been forestalled by poor delivery to the appropriate tissue, cell type, and subcellular compartment. Topical administration is considered to circumvent these issues. The availability of inhalation devices and unmet medical need in lung disease has focused efforts in this tissue. We report the development of a novel cell sorting method for quantitative, cell type-specific analysis of siRNA, and locked nucleic acid (LNA) ASO uptake and efficacy after intratracheal (i.t.) administration in mice. Through fluorescent dye labeling, we compare the utility of this approach to whole animal and whole tissue analysis, and examine the extent of tissue distribution. We detail rapid systemic access and renal clearance for both therapeutic classes and lack of efficacy at the protein level in lung macrophages, epithelia, or other cell types. We nevertheless observe efficient redirection of i.t. administered phosphorothioate (PS) LNA ASO to the liver and kidney leading to targeted gene knockdown. These data suggest delivery remains a key obstacle to topically administered, naked oligonucleotide efficacy in the lung and introduce inhalation as a potentially viable alternative to injection for antisense administration to the liver and kidneys.",

            "text": "Throughout their turbulent, 26-year history, oligonucleotide therapeutics have been faced with two major problems: lack of tissue targeting and inefficient cellular uptake. 1 Presently, these are believed to be insignificant in lung disease applications: lung epithelia and macrophages are directly accessible through inhalation. Moreover, they constitute the primary entry point for respiratory viruses and contribute substantially to the underlying inflammation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 2 Thus, the clinical utility of both classical antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) as inhaled therapeutics is under intense investigation. Notably, whilst the most advanced ASO candidates utilize chemical modifications that impart stability such as phosphorothioate (PS) backbones and 2\u2032-OMethyl nucleosides, 3 siRNA equivalents are 1st generation, unmodified molecules with phosphodiester backbones (PO). 4, 5 Perplexingly, preclinical reports of efficacy have been contradictory: tissue distribution, cell type-specific uptake, extent, and duration of activity as well as immune-stimulatory potential are all matters that have been addressed in a number of different animal models of disease and across rodent and primate species. While the results appear mixed and have been generally attributed to differences in experimental design, it is generally accepted that an efficacious delivery system might be advantageous. 1, [6] [7] [8] [9] Recently, locked nucleic acid (LNA)-containing ASOs have been shown to deliver to the liver of nonhuman primates with remarkable efficacy following parenteral administration. 10 Use of LNA results in substantial increases in the ASO-binding efficiency to its' target, improving efficacy. 11 Consequently, considerably shorter ASO (12-16-mer) can be used with equivalent specificity to classical, >25 nucleotide long ASO. 12 Moreover, their potency in vivo has been reported to be comparable, if not better than that of siRNA, 10, 13 without the requirement of delivery modification or formulation. Studies in multiple cell lines 14, 15 have indicated that at least in vitro, the phenomenon can be replicated in the absence of results Oligonucleotide activity in the lung has so far been reported at the whole tissue level. However, as a number of studies have indicated variable uptake of labeled oligos, efficacy is measured as the average achieved across differentially transfected lung cell types. 1 To directly address this, we developed a tissue disruption and cell sorting method (TDCS) for isolation of disease-relevant cells for downstream analysis. We focused on epithelial cells and macrophages, two of the most important target cells in lung disease. Fresh mouse lung tissues were disrupted using a mechanical/ enzymatic approach yielding single-cell suspensions. Suspensions were then treated by magnetic bead separation and/or fluorescentactivated cell sorting to obtain populations of live epithelial cells, macrophages or the remaining cell types (other) (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2) .",

Unexpectedly, a substantial proportion of the PS-LNA dose was detected in the liver at both 3 and 48 hours after dosing [26.4% (\u00b16.2) and 15.3% (\u00b113.7), respectively].

We therefore decided to further examine the fate of the different classes of oligos after i.t. administration using sulphonated Cy5 dye as a molecular beacon. Curious over the role of lung surfactant in lung cell uptake of siRNA 16 and the impact of its' cationic charge on aggregation with anionic oligonucleotides toward hypothesized in situ particle formation in the lung lumen, we decided to examine the lung tissue across multiple time points. Strikingly, even 15 minutes after i.t. administration, urinal excretion was observed indicating rapid absorption from the lung: the classical fight or flight response to handling resulted in emiction in most animals, with urine from dye control-, siRNA-, and PO-LNA-treated animals being of blue color, most likely on account of the dark blue color of the sulphonated Cy5 dye. This was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis of group-pooled urine samples (Supplementary Figure S3) . Moreover, the sulphonated Cy5-labeled siRNA antisense sequence and PO-LNA, were present in urine samples at higher concentrations than that measured for PS-LNA indicating greater retention of the PS-LNA within the system (Supplementary Table S1 ). Fluorescent imaging of excised, fixed lung tissues indicated that by 24 hours PS-LNA followed by PO-LNA were retained in the lung in a protracted fashion, whereas siRNA was undetectable (Figure 2a,b) . Imaging the entire animals at 24 hours postdosing identified the urinary bladder as a distinct location of siRNA concentration. Importantly, by stark contrast, substantial quantities of PS-LNA were still in circulation (Figure 2c) . These data reaffirmed the functional observations obtained with unlabeled material, indicating that inhaled siRNA, PO, and PS oligos rapidly escape the lung via systemic circulation, with most of the siRNA and PO oligo doses being renally excreted, potentially in a matter of minutes.",

            "text": "To explore the mechanism of systemic access from the lung lumen, we carried out histological studies with the sulphonated Cy5-labeled oligos. Hematoxylin and eosin staining a b documented the absence of any appreciable lymphocytic infiltrate (Supplementary Figure S4) . Confocal imaging of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections further reaffirmed the notion of rapid PO oligo clearance: PS-LNA was uniformly detected in sections across lung lobes (Figure 2d ) whereas no siRNA signal was detected, and a very weak PO-LNA signal was only observed in scattered lung macrophages (Figure 2e) . Examination of the subcellular localization of PS-LNA at 15 minutes indicated the presence of discreet, particulate structures within macrophages >>> alveolar epithelia > bronchial epithelia >> endothelia (Figure 2f) . Moreover, diffuse submucosal fiber staining was also detected in larger airways. Interestingly, no particulate structures were observed in the lung lumen challenging the surfactant::oligo interaction hypothesis. Alternatively, the luminal residence time of such particles might be substantially <15 minutes, or extracellular complexes could be lost during preparation of formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections. By 1 hour accumulation of oligos was further enhanced in alveolar macrophages, and cells reminiscent of type II alveolar epithelia, suggesting ongoing uptake and accumulation in the deep lung. Interestingly, membrane spreading in type I cells and bronchial distribution remained similar (Supplementary Figure S5a) . By 24 hours diffuse cytosolic staining was observed in scattered bronchial epithelia, whereas the majority of oligo appeared to associate with submucosal membranes and elastin fibers (Supplementary Figure S5b) . Collectively, these data indicate that only i.t. administered PS-LNA but not siRNA or PO-LNA are able to enter lung cells in an efficient manner to form discreet intracellular structures following internalization, yet are unable to mediate target gene knockdown. The distinct lack of nuclear localization of PS-LNA across all the time points studied is in accordance with the recent, in vitro-derived proposition that this might be a requirement for efficacy. 15 Curiously, the A549 type II alveolar epithelium cell line has been indicated to exhibit similar PS-LNA ASO uptake patterns in gymnotic experiments in vitro and to be equally refractory to target-specific knockdown. 15 These observations and the data in our study further support the early report of in vitro-in vivo correlation of efficacy for gymnotic experiments. 14 However, the extent to which nuclear 15 or cytosolic GW182-body accumulation 14 is a universally necessary phenomenon or a celltype specific requirement remains to be determined. The nature of the intracellular, punctuate structures formed with PS-LNA in our in vivo studies are the subject of ongoing investigations, though our early attempts have failed to find colocalization with wellestablished markers of early endosomes (EEA1) or caveosomes (caveolin 1). [17] [18] [19] [20] Previous reports of systemic pharmacokinetics of i.t. administered PS ASO, 21 our own observations of liver loading for PS-LNA ASO, and the disappointing performance of inhaled oligos in the lung encouraged us to investigate the utility of this noninvasive route for PS-LNA ASO delivery to the liver. Initially, mice were dosed intravenously (i.v.) with a known oligo against apolipoprotein B (ApoB) 10 and necropsy was performed at time points to provide a kinetic profile of knockdown in the liver. Significant knockdown (P = 0.0079) was achieved after a single dose, with maximal effect being achieved by 24 hours, maintained for up to 7 days (168 hours) (Figure 3a) . Variability within the negative control groups was consistent with normal behavior of gene expression, possibly driven by circadian rhythms and feeding patterns. Due to the high potency exhibited in vivo, a comparison between i.v. and i.t. administration was performed at a 10\u00d7 lower dose. Again, animals were sacrificed at various time points to provide a kinetic insight into knockdown of the target (Figure 3b) . Over 50% knockdown was achieved using either administration route at 168 hours compared to vehicle treatment (Figure 3c) . Overall, i.t. dosing of the ApoB PS-LNA attained 25% and 80% of the exposure observed in the liver and kidney, respectively when compared to i.v. dosing (Figure 3d) . This demonstrates that an appreciable amount of PS-LNA ASO enters the liver after i.t. dosing, which in this case is sufficient to drive significant knockdown of the target mRNA. Notably, the time to maximal effect was delayed in the i.t. dosed group (Figure 3b) . This is most likely due to protracted absorption from the lung into the systemic circulation slowing the time to maximal liver concentration. However, upon chronic weekly administration, as would be expected in the clinic, such small impedance would be expected to be insignificant.",

            "text": "Collectively, these data demonstrate that after direct administration to the lung siRNA and PO-LNA are not readily taken up by lung cells but are instead rapidly absorbed and renally cleared. Thus, the accuracy of early reports of efficacious topical siRNA administration to the lung, challenged in studies examining the utility of both liposomal 22 and polymeric 23 delivery systems in improving topical administration efficacy, are put further into question. Indeed, increasing evidence has amassed that innate immunity activation might have accounted for what numerous groups interpreted as RNA interference. 1 The most striking demonstration of the power of these responses was delivered in a study indicating that siRNA are mild Toll-like receptor 3 agonists: intraperitoneal dosing and Toll-like receptor 3 activation was shown to suppress choroid neovascularization in the rodent eye. 24 Elsewhere, siRNA-mediated Toll-like receptor 7/8 activation was shown to be responsible for curtailing viral infection, including some instances previously reported as on-target RNA interference in pulmonary viral infection models. 25 Taken together, these data suggest that siRNA administered topically to the lung either intranasally or i.t. and without any form of delivery enhancement, do not deliver to lung cells and cannot enact RNA interference. We nonetheless caution extrapolation of our findings to primate species, or larger PS ASO molecules claimed to be efficacious following topical administration in the lung lung. 26, 27 It is rather our view that this body of evidence makes a strong case for examining more closely inhaled oligonucleotide fate in more clinically relevant species or in man, to robustly underpin proof of mechanism conclusions. Importantly, in stark contrast to PO-LNA or siRNA, PS-LNA ASO appeared to be retained in lung epithelia, though appreciable amounts of oligo were detected by mass spectrometry only in macrophages. To our knowledge this is the first report on the subcellular localization of inhaled oligos in the lung across multiple time points and as early as 15 minutes after dosing. Understanding the entry mechanisms and trafficking of PS-LNA in the various cell types of the lung will undoubtedly be important in addressing the lack of efficacy documented in this study. Crucially, despite the observed retention of PS-LNA ASO in the lung, these oligos were also inactive in disease-relevant cell types, suggesting that efficacy in the lung is not an issue of stability, but an issue of delivery. However, PS-LNA ASO also access systemic circulation for an appreciable duration, and are taken up by the liver to exhibit knockdown of a liver mRNA target. These results indicate that inhalation approaches might be of utility to systemically targeted oligonucleotide therapeutics such as aptamers against circulatory or endothelial targets, or liver-and kidney-targeted antisense therapies. Further clinical relevance evaluation, such as the long-term impact of lung administration is, however, necessary: whereas alveolar macrophages were observed to perform their well-documented role of detritus clearance from the deep lung, accumulation in type II alveolar epithelial precursors, the resident lung stem cells, was indicated. If the intracellular bodies observed in our studies are the outcome of serendipitous interaction with membrane proteins, this phenomenon might prove sequencespecific and ultimately inconsequential.",

Nonphosphorothioated oligos partitioned rapidly to systemic circulation and were eliminated via the renal route within minutes. Use of a PS backbone in LNA ASO resulted in appreciable lung macrophage accumulation but with no demonstrable activity. Our histological examinations demonstrate that whilst tissue penetration of the lung is ubiquitous, rapid transport mechanisms might account for systemic access. Crucially, as PS-LNA ASO are relatively refractory to rapid renal clearance, sufficient amounts of lung-absorbed oligo remain in circulation and accumulate in substantial quantities in the liver and kidney. In the case of an ApoB-targeted oligonucleotide, the amount of drug absorbed from the lung was sufficient to accumulate in the liver at a pharmacologically active level, leading to knockdown of ApoB mRNA. Thus, this report pioneers the prospect of noninvasive administration of oligonucleotide therapeutics for circulatory, liver, and kidney diseases.",
