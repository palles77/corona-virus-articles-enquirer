            "text": "Cathepsin B is a lysosomal cysteine protease of the papain-like enzyme family with multiple biological functions. In this study, Paralichthys olivaceus cathepsin B (PoCatB) cDNA was isolated from flounder embryonic cells (FEC) treated with UV-inactivated grass carp hemorrhage virus (GCHV) and subsequently identified as a virally induced gene. The full length cDNA of PoCatB is 1801 bp encoding 330-amino acids. The deduced protein has high homology to all known cathepsin B proteins, containing an N-terminal signal peptide, cysteine protease active sites, the occluding loop segment and a glycosylation site, all of which are conserved in the cathepsin B family. PoCatB transcription of FEC cells could be induced by turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) rhabdovirus (SMRV), UV-inactivated SMRV, UV-inactivated GCHV, poly I:C or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and SMRV or poly I:C was revealed to be most effective among the five inducers. In normal flounder, PoCatB mRNA was detectable in all examined tissues. Moreover, SMRV infection could result in significant upregulation of PoCatB mRNA, predominantly in spleen, head kidney, posterior kidney, intestine, gill and muscle with 18.2, 10.9, 24.7, 12, 31.5 and 18 fold increases at 72 h postinfection respectively. These results provided the first evidence for the transcriptional induction of cathepsin B in fish by virus and LPS, indicating existence of a novel function in viral defense.",

All cathepsins are first synthesized as inactive preproenzymes, and then become activated after proteolytic removal of an N-terminal propeptide [2] . Among the cysteine cathepsins that are papain-like proteases, cathepsin B is the most well studied member. Based on sequence homology and three-dimensional structural similarity, cysteine cathepsins are divided into two subfamilies, the L-like enzymes with the highly conserved interspersed ERFNIN motif in the propeptide region including cathepsin L, and the B-like enzymes with shorter propeptides lacking this motif including cathepsin B [3] . However, cathepsin B possesses an extra 20 amino acid peptide segment, termed the occluding loop. This loop partially blocks the end of the active site cleft and positions a positively charged imidazole group of a histidine residue to accept the negative charge at the C-terminus of the substrate, thus vesting cathepsin B with peptidase activity [4] .",

The main function of cathepsin B has long been believed to degrade proteins that have entered the lysosomal system from outside the cell (via endocytosis or phagocytosis) or from other compartments within the cell (autophagy) [5] . In addition to its physiological roles, cathepsin B is also involved in many pathological processes, such as cancer, apoptosis, inflammation, infection and other diseases [6] [7] [8] [9] . The expression and activity of cathepsin B are able to be upregulated by interferon (IFN)-g and interleukin (IL)-6 [10, 11] . Recent research further suggests that cathepsins B and L might determine host cell susceptibility to infection by intracellular viral pathogens. One group demonstrates that either cathepsin L or B is required for reovirus (a non-enveloped virus with segmented dsRNA genome) entry into murine fibroblasts [12] , another reveals an essential role for cathepsin B in Ebola virus GP-dependent entry [13] , and still another indicates that endosomal proteolysis by cathepsins B and L is necessary for murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 2 spike-mediated entry into hosts [14] .",

In fish, cathepsin B activity has been described in eggs and larvae of different fish species like sea bass [15] , cod [16] , and salmonids [17] , and is implicated in the digestion of the yolk proteins in oocytes, fertilized eggs and the yolk sac, contributing to the quality and viability of the eggs and the energy source of the embryo [15, 18, 19] . Several reports reveal an immuno-regulatory role for some fish cathepsins. Cathepsin D is identified in the mucus of wounded catfish, participating in generation of a potent 19-residue linear antimicrobial peptide named parasin I from unacetylated histone H2A [20, 21] . Cathepsins B and L are secreted by Japanese eel skin epidermal cells [22] and their activities significantly increase during bacteriosis via the skin [23] . These findings indicate that cathepsins have complex functions and might play different roles under different conditions.",

PoCatB had a similar protein structure with human cathepsin B [4] , consisting of a preregion (1-18 residues), a proregion (19-78 residues), and a mature form (79-330 residues). The mature form was also composed of light chain and heavy chain. PoCatB had a processing site at Ala18-Arg19 between preregion and proregion, a processing site at Lys78-Leu79 between proregion and mature form, and a potential N-glycosylation site at Asn190. Three active sites were predicated at Cys107, His277 and Asn297. The conserved segment 'occluding loop', characteristic of mammalian cathepsin B proteins, was found in PoCatB. In addition, four residues governing for the exopeptidase or endopeptidase activity, His187, His188, Glu249 and Glu323, were observed, and the 12 conserved Cys responsible for the disulphide bridges were located in similar positions (Fig. 1) [4] .

As shown in Fig. 3A , PoCatB mRNA was detectable in all tested normal flounder tissues. Compared to the expression level in liver, more transcripts were observed in other tissues of normal flounder. Ovary presented the highest expression level of PoCatB with 19.6 fold higher than that in liver. The amount of transcripts displayed 9.8, 7.9, 7.8, 2.8, 7.8, 1.3, 4.6, 15.7 and 1.7 fold in spleen, head kidney, posterior kidney, skin, heart, muscle, brain, intestine and gill respectively than that in liver. Injection of flounder fishes with SMRV for 72 h resulted in upregulation of PoCatB transcription. Among the 11 tested tissues, gill displayed most significant increase in PoCatB mRNA with about 31.5 fold as high as the counterpart in normal flounder. The spleen, head kidney, posterior kidney, intestine and muscle displayed 18.2, 10.9, 24.7, 12 and 18 fold increases at 72 h post-infection respectively, and 6.9-8.2 fold higher abundance of PoCatB was observed in liver, heart and brain. However, the expression levels of PoCatB in skin and ovary were virtually unchanged (0.8 and 1.1 respectively) after SMRV infection. As a positive control to testify the induction effect in vivo, flounder Mx expression was then detected, and Mx mRNA was induced in all 11 tissues with about 3.2-1241 fold abundance, with significant differences in posterior kidney, intestine, liver and head kidney (Fig. 3B) .",

The delay in reaching maximum transcript expression of PoCatB in SMRV infection compared to that in poly I:C treatment could be ascribed to the time for the virus replication and particle release cycles. LPS is a component of Gram-negative bacteria. The expression of PoCatB was induced from 12 h post-treatment, sustained at a low level and reached the peak of about 4.5 fold upregulation at 96 h ( Fig. 2A) . This corroborates the report that LPS induces increased intracellular cathepsin B activity in THP-1 cells [40] . This suggested that the enzyme in flounder might also have a role in defense against bacteria as demonstrated in the skins of some fishes such as Japanese eel and catfish [23] . The gene expression levels of PoCatB were quite different when induced by different stimuli such as SMRV and LPS (Fig. 2) , and we thought that the different downstream signaling pathway would be the point. Microbes induce immune responses of host cells by interacting with certain cell surface receptors, termed pattern recognition receptors. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been identified as important pattern recognition receptors, with a large family containing at least 11 members. Each TLR has a specific ligand(s). Accumulating evidence shows that different pathogen molecules lead to activate distinct TLRs. TLR2 and its coreceptor CD14 recognize LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and directly mediate LPS induced signaling pathways [41] . TLR9 is involved in recognition of bacterial flagellin, while TLR2 and TLR6 are required in response to peptidoglycan. DsRNA is always produced by most viruses during their replication and induces the synthesis of type I interferons by activation of TLR3 [42, 43] . Various combinations of TLR receptors may be used to discriminate different microbes [44] , and different TLR receptors elicit different downstream signaling pathways. Interestingly, two TLRs (TLR2 and TLR22) were found in Japanese flounder and both of them were induced by peptidoglycan and poly I:C [45] . In our study, the expression of PoCatB was induced by virus, poly I:C and LPS treatments, and this suggests that TLRs could be involved in the induced production of cathepsins. However, this needs further investigation.",

Knockout analysis has shown that cathepsin B plays a major role in pathological trypsinogen activation in the early course of experimental pancreatitis and contributes significantly to TNF-a induced hepatocyte apoptosis [46] . Recently, cathepsins B and L have been found to determine host cell susceptibility to infection by many viral pathogens, including reovirus [12] , Ebola virus [13] and murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [14] . However, in some fish species, cathepsin B activity is involved in the processing of yolk materials, and in insects and other arthropods, cathepsin B and L participate in key developmental processes [47, 48] . Moreover, cathepsin B seems to exert different, even opposite, effects under the control of certain conditions. For instance, cathepsin B promotes angiogenesis during cancer progression [9] , while it is also found to suppress angiogenesis in endothelial cells [49] . These findings suggest some complex and specific functions of cathepsin B depending on different species or different cell types, and also indicate that there might be some physiological role of cathepsin B. In the present study, it is plausible that the upregulation of flounder cathepsin B by virus infection is associated with a certain host cell response, since previous studies have found that cathepsin B activity coincides with bacteriolysis in Japanese eel skin [50] and is also detected in flounder skin [51] .",

A phylogenetic analysis also suggests that, from an evolutionary view, cathepsins are antigen-processing enzymes, since the major selection pressure driving the evolution of the new vertebrate cathepsins may derive from the adaptive immune system which emerged with the gnatheostomes [38] . On the basis of these findings, combined with the ubiquitous expression in all tissues, flounder cathepsin B induction by virus infection might be related to host cell survival, even to antiviral immune responses. In order to testify this hypothesis, it is high of interest to further study the function of PoCatB under different stresses in the future.",

            "text": "sion of PoCatB under diverse stresses. The kinetics of PoCatB expression was first investigated in FEC cells treated with several inducers including UV-inactivated GCHV, UV-inactivated SMRV, active SMRV and poly I:C. To investigate the induction of PoCatB by bacterial infection, LPS (a glycolipid component of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls) was used to treat FEC cells. As expected, all inducers could upregulate transcription of PoCatB gene as compared to the basal expression level in normal cells (Fig. 2A). However, diverse expression patterns were induced by different stimuli. Among five inducers, poly I:C and active SMRV were the most effective to induce expression of PoCatB, with a maximum level at 12 h post-treatment (being about 26 fold as high as the expression level at 0 h FEC sample) and at 96 h post-treatment (being about 25 fold), respectively. However, the expression pattern of PoCatB by active SMRV attack was quite different from that by poly I:C treatment. Upregulation of PoCatB transcription by SMRV infection first appeared at 48 h postinfection (1.1 fold compared to 0 h), then being enhanced at 72 h (13.1 fold), and at last it reached the highest level at 96 h (about 25 fold). But by poly I:C treatment, PoCatB transcription increased at 0.5 h post-treatment (9.8 fold), then declining at 6 h (3.8 fold), and reached its highest level at 12 h (about 26 fold). From the time points 24, 48, 72 to 96 h post-poly I:C treatment, the elevated fold of transcripts were 13.4, 13.0, 3.7 and 10.2, respectively. In comparison with poly I:C and active SMRV, the other three stimuli, UV-inactivated GCHV, UV-inactivated SMRV and LPS, stimulated a moderate expression of PoCatB, there being the highest transcriptional levels with 4.5 fold at 96 h, 2.2 fold at 72 h, and 4.5 fold at 96 h post-treatment, and their first upregulated expression of PoCatB appeared at 0.5 h (1.4 fold), 72 h (2.2 fold) and 12 h (1.5 fold), respectively. In all induction tests, FEC cells were grown in FCS-free DMEM. To detect whether FEC-free DMEM contributed to the increase in PoCatB mRNA, the transcripts of PoCatB were investigated in control FEC cells that was incubated in FCS-free DMEM alone. The result showed that no upregulation of PoCatB was observed",
