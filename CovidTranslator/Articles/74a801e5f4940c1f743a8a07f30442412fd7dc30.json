CLRV is naturally transmitted through infected seed and pollen (Callahan, 1957; Schimanski et al., 1972; Cooper, 1976; Cooper et al., 1984; Massalski et al., 1984; Massalski et al., 1988) thus providing the virus a rapid rate of natural spread in the usual woody hosts. For the walnut strain natural spread has been estimated in a commercial walnut orchard to result in an increase of the number of infected trees of about 20% per year . The walnut strain of CLRV (wCLRV) is the causal agent of a lethal disease of English walnuts known as blackline. This disease is the result of a hypersensitive reaction at the graft union with North California black walnut rootstock when susceptible English walnut scions become infected (Mircetich et al., 1980; Rowhani et al., 1988) .",

Our direct ELISA with alkaline-phosphatase conjugate was less sensitive, as the dilution end point of tobacco infected sap for direct ELISA is between 1 /SO and l/160. This reduction in sensitivity could probably be due to partial damage of the wCLRV ELISA reagents (antibodies and conjugates) during the transport.

Similar tests using a reverse transcription step prior to cDNA amplification have been developed for detection of viroids (Puchta et al., 1989; Hadidi et al., 1990) , for several animal RNA viruses including rhinovirus (Gama et al., 1989) , HIV (Byrne et al., 1988; Hart et al., 1988; Murakawa et al., 1988) , human picornaviruses (Hyypia et al., 1989) , and for plant RNA viruses (Vunsh et al., 1990; Korschineck et al., 1991) .

The cDNA insert in the middle of the multiple cloning site and the T7 promoter are represented in the figure. The restriction sites represented in the figure are Pstl (P), BumHI (B), EcoRI (E), Sufl (Sl), SpM (Sp). The region was sequenced (Borja et al.. in preparation). Two l7mer oligonucleotides were selected from this sequence: the last I7 nucleotides of the UTR (3' primer), and the I7 nucleotides in positions 1177-I 194 (5' primer) of the UTR. The positions and polarity of these 17mers are shown in the figure. Arrows limit the region synthesized by the Taq DNA polymerase.",
