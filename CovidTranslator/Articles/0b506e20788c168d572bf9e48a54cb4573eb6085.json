We studied one mechanism by which vomiting is induced in pigs infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) by characterization of swine EC cells by immunohistochemistry. Conventional or gnotobiotic (Gn) 9-day-old pigs [PEDV-inoculated (n = 12); Mock (n = 14)] were inoculated orally (8.9-9.2 log 10 genomic equivalents/pig) with PEDV PC21A strain or mock. This is the first identification of serotonin-positive EC cells in swine by immunohistochemistry and mainly in intestinal crypts, regardless of infection status. They were morphologically triangular-shaped or round cells with or without apical cytoplasmic extensions, respectively. At post-inoculation hour (PIH) 16 or 24, when vomiting was first or frequently observed, respectively, PEDV infection resulted in significantly reduced numbers of serotonin-positive EC cells in duodenum, mid-jejunum, ileum, or colon. However, two of three PEDV-inoculated Gn pigs that did not yet show vomiting at PIH 16 had numbers of serotonin-positive EC cells in duodenum, ileum and colon similar to those in the negative controls. These findings suggest that serotonin release from EC cells (increased serotonin levels) into the gut submucosa might occur early PEDV post-infection to stimulate the vagal afferent neurons, followed by vomiting. Serotonin might be involved in the mechanisms related to vomiting in PEDV-infected piglets. We also found that mid-jejunum was the primary site of acute PEDV infection, and that systemic innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses were induced during the acute stage of PEDV infection.",

            "text": "Vomiting is a defensive reaction of the body to rapidly remove ingested toxins from the gastrointestinal tract. Vomiting is generally induced when either of the two medullary centers in the brain, integrative vomiting center and chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ), is activated via a variety of their surface chemoreceptors, such as 5-HT 3 (Endo et al., 2000; Sikander et al., 2009; Spiller, 2008) . The integrative vomiting center and CRTZ are triggered by activation of vagal afferent neurons in the gastrointestinal tract and circulating toxins in blood, respectively. There are vagal or enteric afferent neurons in the gut submucosa. Vagal afferent neurons are stimulated by a monoamine neurotransmitter molecule, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), released from enterochromaffin (EC) cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Subsequently, vomiting signals are transmitted to the integrative vomiting center and then to the central nervous system (CNS). Emetic efferent signals from the CNS reach the gastrointestinal and abdominal muscles, leading to their expulsive actions by which vomiting is induced (Endo et al., 2000; Sikander et al., 2009; Spiller, 2008) .",

            "text": "In humans, approximately 95% and 5% of serotonin is stored in the gut and brain, respectively. In the gut, 90% of serotonin is deposited in the secretory granules of EC cells mainly located in intestinal crypts, and 10% is in neurons in the submucosa (Endo et al., 2000; Spiller, 2008) . In humans or rats, by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies against serotonin, EC cells were serotonin-positive and triangular-shaped with apical cytoplasmic extensions (Gustafsson et al., 2006; Spiller, 2008) . The EC cells likely originate from intestinal crypt stem cells. A mechanical, biological, or chemical stimulus causes EC cells to secret serotonin into the lamina propria or lumen that acts on serotonin receptors (5-HT 3 ) at the terminals of the vagal afferent neurons (Endo et al., 2000; Gustafsson et al., 2006; Spiller, 2008) . Serotonin also functions to promote immune activation through the receptors expressed on macrophages, dendritic cells and T and B cells (Li et al., 2011; Shajib and Khan, 2015) .",

Diarrhea is frequently accompanied by vomiting in PEDV-infected nursing piglets during the acute stage of infection, exacerbating dehydration . However, the mechanisms by which vomiting is induced in PEDV infection are poorly understood. We hypothesized that: i) serotonin is involved in the mechanisms related to vomiting; ii) serotonin release from EC cells into the intestinal lamina propria or lumen occurs early PEDV post-infection to stimulate the vagal afferent neurons, followed by vomiting; and iii) expression levels of serotonin in intestinal EC cells or numbers of serotonin-positive EC cells in the small or large intestine differ between PEDV-infected and uninfected pigs. The in situ distribution and characterization of EC cells in swine intestine are also unknown. In our study, therefore, we aimed to develop an IHC to detect and characterize EC cells in swine intestine and to determine whether PEDV infection alters the number of serotonin-positive EC cells in the small and large intestines (primary sites of PEDV infection) of infected gnotobiotic (Gn) or conventional, 9-day-old piglets during disease progression. We also aimed to detail the pathogenesis of acute PEDV infection, including intestinal distribution of PEDV antigen and serum innate and pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in infected Gn pigs to understand the relationship of acute PEDV infection with the frequency of serotoninpositive EC cells in the small and large intestines.",

The SPF herd was seronegative for antibodies to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine circovirus type 2. Six 9-day-old Gn piglets were randomly assigned to one of two groups: PEDV-infected (n = 3; pigs 1-3) and Mock (n = 3; pigs 4-6).

IHC results from only the mid-jejunum and cecum/colon of the conventional pigs were reported in the previous paper .

Mean ratios of jejunal or ileal villous height to crypt depth (VH:CD) were calculated in Gn pigs, as described previously . Only well-orientated, hematoxylin and eosin-stained jejunal or ileal sections were measured and care was taken to ensure that only transverse sections cut perpendicularly from the villus tip to the muscularis mucosa were included. Villous height and crypt depth were estimated by measuring 4-5 villi and crypts throughout the section from each Gn pig.",

The variable numbers were dependent on the location of intestinal tissues. In PEDV-inoculated pigs at PIDs 1-5, unlike mock-inoculated pigs, entire jejunal and ileal villi were infrequently observed even at \u00d7250 magnification, because the villi were severely atrophied. Only single crypt layer-included areas in well-orientated intestinal tissue sections were evaluated to count the number of serotonin-positive EC cells.

In an attempt to explore this effect, a further study using six 9-day-old Gn pigs inoculated orally with 9.2 log 10 GE/pig (pigs 1-3) or mock (pigs 4-6) was conducted to investigate alterations in the number of serotonin-positive EC cells in the small and large intestines at an earlier time-point concurrent with or shortly after vomiting was first detected, as compared with PID 1 when most of the conventional 9-day-old pigs tested already exhibited vomiting. After virus inoculation, vomiting and other clinical signs such as diarrhea were monitored frequently to determine an earlier time-point appropriate for euthanasia. In our experiments, at PIH 16, pig 3 began to exhibit vomiting (but no diarrhea), whereas pigs 1 and 2 did not show any clinical signs. Thus, inoculated pigs 1-3 and negative control pigs 4-6 were euthanized at PIH 16 for virological and pathological examination to determine their infection status and to understand the relationship of acute PEDV infection and frequency of serotonin-positive EC cells in the small and large intestines. The results are summarized in Table 2 . At PIH 16, by qRT-PCR, no PEDV-inoculated Gn pigs 1-3 or negative control pigs 4-6 had detectable viral RNA (< 4.8 log 10 GE/ml) in the feces. However, pigs 1-3 had moderate viral RNA titers in serum at PIH 16, ranging from 8.1 to 8.5 log 10 GE/ml, whereas no negative control pigs 4-6 had detectable viral RNA (< 3.8 log 10 GE/ ml) in the serum.",

            "text": "Our study demonstrates that the monoclonal antibody 5HT-H209 is useful for the detection of serotonin in EC cells in swine intestinal tissues. Similar to serotonin-positive intestinal EC cells identified by IHC in humans or rats (Gustafsson et al., 2006; Spiller, 2008) , swine EC cells were also mainly localized in intestinal crypts, and they were morphologically triangular-shaped or round cells with or without apical cytoplasmic extensions, respectively. Like EC cells in humans, swine intestinal EC cells were the most frequent in duodenum compared with the other intestinal segments (Tables 1 and 4) (Endo et al., 2000; Spiller, 2008) . At PIH 16 or PID 1, when vomiting was first or frequently observed in PEDV-inoculated Gn or conventional pigs, respectively, the number of serotonin-positive EC cells was significantly reduced in the small and large intestines, compared with the negative controls. However, two of three PEDV-inoculated Gn pigs (pigs 1 and 2) that did not exhibit vomiting at PIH 16 concomitantly showed numbers of serotonin-positive EC cells in the small (but not mid-jejunum) and large intestines similar to those in the negative controls. These findings suggest that serotonin release from EC cells into the intestinal lamina propria or lumen (increased serotonin levels in the gut submucosa) occurred early post-infection to stimulate the vagal afferent neurons, followed by vomiting. The procedure may be essential for inducing vomiting in PEDV-infected piglets. At PID 1, reduced numbers of serotonin-positive EC cells were observed from the duodenum to the colon of conventional pigs, although extensive villous atrophy with a large amount of PEDV antigen was confined to the jejunum and ileum. In contrast, the duodenum and colon showed no or mild villous atrophy with little PEDV antigen at PID 1. We speculate that regardless of the tissue tropism of the virus, EC cells in all intestinal segments (duodenum to colon) might be involved in the induction of vomiting in PEDV-infected piglets.",

Also, there was little information on the pathogenesis of acute PEDV infection in young piglets prior to onset of clinical signs. At PIH 16, PEDV RNA was not detected in feces but was detected in serum (8.1-8.5 log 10 GE/ml) of PEDV-inoculated Gn pigs. Our observations are similar to a previous study, showing that only 1 of 20 (5%) 1-dayold, caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs inoculated orally with 10 3 PEDV plaque-forming units/pig were positive for PEDV RNA in the feces at PIH 12 (Madson et al., 2016) . In the same study, however, 4 of 5 pigs (80%) were positive for PEDV RNA in serum at the same time-point. Based on these and our observations, viremia (viral RNA) may be detected earlier than fecal virus RNA shedding in PEDVinfected piglets. As our IHC study also revealed large amounts of PEDV antigens in the small intestine of PEDV-inoculated Gn pigs 1-3 at PIH 16, viremia might be a result of diffusion or spread of replicated PEDV from the infected intestine to the blood, although the detailed mechanisms need to be studied further. Based on our histopathologic and IHC observations in PEDV-inoculated Gn pigs 1-3 at PIH 16, PEDV initially and mainly infected the mild-jejunum and to a lesser extent, ileum; however, PEDV infection of the duodenum, proximal jejunum, and distal jejunum was less compared with the mid-jejunum and ileum. In addition, our IHC study did not find any PEDV antigen in the pylorus of the PEDV-inoculated pigs 1-3. Our pilot study also included another location of proximal jejunum distant by approximately 30 cm from the pylorus. We found that infectivity of PEDV in this intestinal segment was more similar to that found in the mid-jejunum compared with the other proximal jejunum segment (distant by 15-20 cm from the pylorus) closer to the pylorus. These observations underscore that the mid-jejunum and ileum may be the primary sites of acute PEDV infection , although the exact cause of the distinct tissue tropism remains obscure in terms of virus-host cell interactions at the molecular level.",

            "text": "It is debatable whether PEDV induces innate immune or pro-inflammatory responses in infected pigs, because most of the research has been conducted in cell cultures in vitro . However, our previous study showed increased serum IFN\u03b1 and IL-12 at PID 1 in conventional 9-day-old nursing pigs infected with PEDV . Our current study also clearly showed that infected Gn pigs exhibited systemic innate (IFN\u03b1 and IL-22) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and IL-12) cytokine responses after acute PEDV infection, similar to the reported increased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF\u03b1) in IPEC-J2 cells infected with PEDV (Lin et al., 2017) . In particular, 3-to 6-fold increases in the pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in infected Gn pigs 1-3 coincided with the decreased or loss of appetite following acute PEDV infection in young suckling piglets (Langhans, 2000) . EC cells secrete serotonin in response to mechanical stimulation as well as recognition of pathogens via toll-like receptors (Worthington, 2015) . Several studies showed that serotonin functions to promote immune activation through the receptors expressed on macrophages, dendritic cells, and T and B cells (Li et al., 2011; Shajib and Khan, 2015) . In our pilot study, increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory and innate cytokines coincided with reduced numbers in serotonin-positive intestinal EC cells, i.e. serotonin release from EC cells in the gut submucosa, during the early stage of infection (PIH 16 to PID 1) (Tables 3  and 4 ). This suggests a possible involvement of EC cells and serotonin, not only in triggering an emetic response but also in development of innate or pro-inflammatory immune responses to acute PEDV infection. However, the potentially beneficial or detrimental effects or roles of those innate and pro-inflammatory cytokines and serotonin in infected piglets need to be studied further.",

            "text": "As tested in PEDV-inoculated Gn pigs 1-3 at PIH 16, our IHC observations revealed that early localization of PEDV antigen is evident in the villous-crypt interface of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum during the acute or incubation stage of infection ( Fig. 2A-F) , similar to previous observations (Madson et al., 2016) . A similar observation was also detected by IHC in 1-day-old, CDCD pigs inoculated with a porcine deltacoronaivrus at PIH 12-24 (Jung and Saif, unpublished) , implying a similar tissue tropism between these two viruses during the early stages of infection. The PEDV antigen-positive regions appeared first in the villus-crypt interface and subsequently expanded to the upper and then entire villous epithelium of the jejunum to ileum. Our data indicate that enzymatically immature (young) enterocytes in the villous-crypt interface of the small intestine, relative to the enzymatically mature (older) enterocytes located at the villous tips, might be the major infection site of PEDV. During the incubation period, similar to vibrio cholera (cholera toxin) or rotavirus (non-structural viral protein 4) (Spiller, 2008) , PEDV itself or undefined secondary mediators from the infected host might act to trigger serotonin release from EC cells. Because the infection site of PEDV is close to the crypt layer where the majority of serotonin-positive EC cells are located, it might be beneficial for PEDV itself or secondary mediators to access EC cells in the crypt layers. In our study, although PEDV antigen-positive cells were confined to villous epithelium (not crypt epithelium where the majority of serotonin-positive EC cells were localized), whether PEDV can also infect EC cells needs to be studied further. At PID 5 when vomiting disappeared completely, the numbers of serotonin-positive EC cells in the small and large intestines of the conventional pigs recovered and were comparable to those in the negative controls. The rapid recovery could imply a rapid turnover of EC cells to compensate for the reduced numbers. However, the turnover time of EC cells (15-150 days) is much slower than for enterocytes (2-4 days) in rats (de Bruine et al., 1992) . Thus, the rapid recovery of the number of serotonin-positive EC cells might be a result of increased synthesis and deposition of serotonin in EC cells.",

Serotonin receptor (5-HT 3 ) antagonists may be useful targets as a therapeutic intervention to suppress acute vomiting in PEDV-infected pigs, especially in cases when the clinical signs are severe. Therefore, further studies are needed to test whether 5-HT 3 antagonists are effective to inhibit or suppress acute vomiting in PEDV-infected pigs. To evaluate the disease mechanisms and comparative pathogenesis of PEDV strains in young piglets during the acute or incubation stage of PEDV infection, the mid-jejunum and ileum are the most critical and useful intestinal locations for histological analysis. Our study also revealed that acute PEDV infection with evidence of PEDV RNA in serum, induces systemic innate (IFN\u03b1 and IL-22) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and IL-12) cytokine responses in young Gn pigs.",
