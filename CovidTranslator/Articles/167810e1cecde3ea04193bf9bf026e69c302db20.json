DC-Cholesterol: DOPE (dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine) / plasmid DNA lipoplexes were prepared at a 3-to-2 DC-Cholesterol + to DNA \u2212 molar ratio and lyophilized prior to storing at room temperature, 40 \u00b0C, and 60 \u00b0C for three months. Different residual moistures (1.93%, 1.10%, 1.06% and 0.36%) were obtained by altering the secondary drying temperatures. In addition to moisture content, lipoplex formulations were evaluated after freezedrying and/ or storage for particle size, transfection efficiency, accumulation of TBARS (thiobarbituric reactive substances), glass transition temperature, DNA supercoil content, and surface area. Lipoplex formulations stored at room temperature for 3 months maintain TBARS concentrations and supercoil contents. At higher storage temperatures, formulations possessing the highest moisture content (1.93%) maintained significantly lower TBARS concentrations and higher supercoil content than those with the lowest (0.36%) moisture content. Curiously, the intermediate moisture contents exhibited marked differences in stability despite virtually identical moisture contents. Subsequent measurements of surface area indicated that the lower stability corresponded to higher surface area in the dried cake, suggesting that there may be an interplay between water content and surface area that contributes to storage stability.",

            "text": "Genetic therapeutics have future potential as treatments of currently incurable diseases such as cancers, SARS, and AIDS. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] These therapeutics typically require a delivery vehicle to enhance biological activity, and there is intense interest in developing a synthetic, nonviral vector that is safe and effective. This emphasis on improving delivery has assumed that the well-recognized stability problems associated with particulate delivery systems will ultimately be resolved. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] In an attempt to develop stable formulations of nonviral vectors, our laboratory has focused on improving the stability of synthetic delivery systems during lyophilization and storage. Although we have demonstrated that the chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and \u03b1-tocopherol dramatically reduce degradation involving trace metal contaminants and lipid, respectively, degradation is still observed during prolonged storage. 11 Our previous work has shown that even in very dry samples that are stored well below the glass transition temperature, DNA and lipid degrade slowly over a 2-year period. 12 Furthermore, the mechanism of degradation appears to involve reactive oxygen species that oxidize lipids in the dried state. 13 Since it is generally thought that stability during drying is largely due to the reduced molecular mobility that attenuates chemical reactions in the dried state, it is typically assumed that enhanced stability can be achieved at lower moisture contents. 14 Accordingly, the purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of moisture content on storage stability of nonviral vector formulations.",

            "text": "The enhanced stability offered by the removal of water has been utilized extensively by mother nature and the pharmaceutical industry. 15, 16 It has been conclusively demonstrated that sugars (e.g., sucrose, trehalose) are able to preserve macromolecules during drying. 17 The mechanism by which sugars exert their protective effect is thought to involve both glass formation 18, 19 and hydrogen bonding, 20 although the validity of these mechanisms is still debated. 21 Regardless of the precise mechanism responsible for stabilization, the role of water as both a reactant and plasticizer suggests that progressively greater stability should be observed at lower moisture contents. 14 Furthermore, the fact that lower storage temperatures extend shelf-life is consistent with the notion that reduced molecular mobility in the dried state is responsible for stabilization. Attempts to correlate stability with the degree to which the storage temperature is below the glass transition temperature also implies that molecular mobility is ultimately the critical parameter responsible for stability in the dried state. 19 In contrast to these assertions, multiple studies have observed that very low moisture content actually accelerates degradation in dried viruses and proteins. 22, 23 More specifically, in very dry formulations, different oxidation pathways appear to dominate protein degradation. 24 For gene vectors, overdried virus formulations are also reported to have lower titer compared those having slightly higher moisture contents. 25, 26 It has been proposed that overdried protein formulations cause the exposure of some hydrophilic sites to oxygen, which may promote degradation. 27 Studies have also argued for the existence of an optimal (as opposed to the lowest attainable) residual moisture. 23, 27 Other reports have stressed the importance of specific surface area (SSA), and some studies have suggested that optimal water content may be determined by that needed for monolayer coverage of the available surface. [28] [29] [30] While the interactions among these factors likely play a role in stabilization, this study was designed to be an initial investigation into the effects of moisture content on the storage stability of freezedried lipoplexes.",

The lipid mixture (containing \u03b1tocopherol) was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and placed under vacuum for more than 2 hours, subsequently resuspended in autoclaved, distilled HEPES buffer, and sonicated for 5 minutes immediately before use. The liposome preparation contained 12.59 \u00b5M \u03b1-tocopherol, 603 \u00b5M DC-Cholesterol, and 403 \u00b5M DOPE. Liposomes and DNA were mixed in equal volumes at a final HEPES buffer concentration at 20 mM and at pH 7.8. At this pH value, 94% of the DC-Cholesterol molecules are uncharged. All formulations that contained complexes had 40 \u00b5g/ml initial DNA concentration and 500-trehalose-to-DNA weight ratio before freezedrying and storage. A final volume of 0.2 ml for each vial was transferred to 1-ml flat-bottomed borosilicate freeze-drying vials (West Pharmaceutical Services Incorporation, Lionville, PA). The final concentrations of these components were: 120 \u00b5M DC-Cholesterol, 80 \u00b5M DOPE, 2.5 \u00b5M \u03b1-tocopherol, 8 \u00b5g DNA/vial, 200 \u00b5M DTPA, and 4 mg trehalose/vial. All formulations were incubated for at least 30 min at room temperature prior to lyophilization. All freeze-drying experiments were performed in an FTS DuraStop \u00ae lyophilizer (Stone Ridge, NY) with freezing (4 hr, 2.5 \u00b0C/min, and product temperature at \u221227\u00b0C due to heat radiation) and primary drying (60 mTorr) at \u221230\u00b0C for 24 hours, and secondary drying at 20, 5, 0 or \u221210 \u00b0C (8 hours, 60 mTorr, and 0.2 \u00b0C/min). The freezing and primary drying temperature were derived from our previous finding indicating that drying can be conducted slightly above T g ' without risk of collapse. 37 After freeze-drying, all vials were purged with argon gas (450 Torr) that had been passed through an oxygen scrubber (Agilent Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA) to remove low levels of oxygen contamination. After backfilling, vials were sealed with acid-washed/ rinsed/ dried rubber stoppers and with aluminum caps. The pH value after freezing was tested by adding a Fisher Universal Indicator Solution (pH Range 4-11, Pittsburgh, PA) into some sample vials. No color change was observed from 20 to \u221230 \u00b0C for this HEPES system. The accuracy of this pH dye was \u00b1 0.5 pH units.",

Previous studies have utilized different sucrose: mannitol ratios to prepare lyophilized samples with different moisture contents and identified optimal water contents for virus formulations. 25 One drawback of this approach is that the formulations are altered with regards to sugar, and glass transition temperature, in addition to water content. While the amount of the different sugars can affect stability of nonviral vectors during lyophilization, 40 it is also important to realize that very low levels of metal contaminants can cause dramatic differences in stability during storage, 41 and therefore altering the relative levels of two components (and their associated contaminants) can complicate the interpretation. In the present study, identical formulations were prepared and subjected to different lyophilization conditions to achieve several residual moisture contents. More specifically, different secondary drying temperatures were utilized (\u221210\u00b0C, 0\u00b0C, 5\u00b0C, and 20\u00b0C) to achieve moisture contents of 1.93 \u00b1 0.11%, 1.10 \u00b1 0.14%, 1.06 \u00b1 0.03%, and 0.36 \u00b1 0.10%, respectively, according to the methods of Pikal et al. 42 This approach resulted in preparations with three significantly different moisture contents.

            "text": "Results from transfection experiments show that storage of lipoplexes for 3 months did not substantially affect biological activity regardless of moisture content (Fig. 2) . The data at 60 \u00b0C does exhibit greater variation, but all formulations stored for 3 months possess transfection levels that are not significantly different from fresh controls. This is surprising considering our previous studies demonstrating a progressive decrease in transfection during 8 weeks of storage. 11 This previous work identified both DTPA and \u03b1-tocopherol as formulation components that reduced oxidation and preserved lipoplexes during storage. However, our prior work did not test the combination of these two excipients, and we believe that the improved maintenance of transfection rates observed in the current study is due to formulation with both DTPA and \u03b1-tocopherol. Previous studies on the stability of DNA have also shown that a combination of a chelator (e.g., DTPA) with a radical scavenger is capable of greatly extending shelf-life in solution. 43 Our previous work also utilized a different lipid formulation which may contribute to the observed differences. Our results show that particle size was retained during 3 months of storage, in contrast to our previous study (Fig. 3) . 11 Although transfection and particle size were completely preserved during storage, changes in supercoil content were evident during storage at all temperatures (Fig. 4) . Not surprisingly, the loss of supercoil content was more dramatic at higher storage temperatures, and clear differences among the various moisture contents were observed at both 40 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C (Figs. 4B+C). More specifically, we did not observe a strong correlation of supercoil content with moisture levels, but the driest formulation (SD@20\u00b0C) exhibited consistently greater DNA degradation than did the formulation with the highest moisture content (SD@\u221210\u00b0C). The most surprising finding is that the formulations with comparable water contents (SD@0\u00b0C and SD@5\u00b0C) exhibited markedly different abilities to maintain DNA integrity in the dried state. Furthermore, the greatest retention of supercoil content at 60 \u00b0C was observed in samples possessing intermediate moisture content (SD@5\u00b0C), while other samples containing the same residual moisture (SD@0\u00b0C) exhibited degradation rates similar to the worst-performing, driest formulation (Fig. 4C) . These results suggest that factors other than water content play a significant role in the storage stability of our preparations.",

Our results show that aldehyde formation is minimal in samples stored at room temperature, but that storage of samples at 40 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C resulted in substantial aldehyde formation (Fig. 5) . Similar to changes in supercoil content, we did not observe a strong correlation between TBARS and residual moisture, but significant differences in aldehyde levels were observed. In particular, the driest samples exhibited consistently higher levels of aldehydes than samples possessing the highest residual moisture, and samples at the highest moisture content (SD@\u221210\u00b0C; 1.9% moisture) consistently had the lowest levels of aldehdye formation (Fig. 5) . Similar to the results on DNA integrity, the two samples containing intermediate moisture contents displayed markedly different behavior despite having equivalent residual moisture. These observations are somewhat surprising because water is generally considered to be a plasticizer which can also participate in hydrolytic reactions. Therefore, it is typically assumed that greater stability and lower reactivity is achieved at lower moisture contents, in contrast to our findings. It should be noted that the glass transition temperature of all samples remained high (> 98\u00b0C, Table 1 ) and essentially constant throughout the duration of the experiments, so mobility of the DNA and lipid components in the dried state should be highly restricted in all cases. Moreover, aldehyde formation and loss of supercoil content was observed in samples even though T\u2212T g \u2265 50 \u00b0C for most samples, suggesting that limitation of macromolecular mobility is not sufficient to achieve long term stability of dried lipoplex formulations.",

Although the highest moisture content demonstrated consistently greater stability than the driest samples, the effect of intermediate moisture content was unpredictable. In particular, one preparation (SD@5\u00b0C) at intermediate moisture exhibited high stability while degradation was rapid in a second preparation (SD@0\u00b0C) at the same moisture content. Despite these differences, samples that experienced the greatest loss in supercoil content also exhibited high levels of aldehydes. As shown in Fig. 6 , a correlation exists between the formation of aldehydes (as detected by TBARS) and the loss of DNA integrity for samples stored at 60\u00b0C for \u2265 2 months (R 2 =0.8047). This correlation is in agreement with our previous studies and strongly suggests that lipid oxidation contributes significantly to the loss of DNA integrity. 11, 13 While all the formulations in our current study contain DTPA and \u03b1-tocopherol to attenuate lipid oxidation, these results indicate that low levels of oxidation still occur in the presence of these excipients, and that oxidation ultimately limits storage stability of lipoplex formulations in the dried state.",

            "text": "While the above correlation of DNA integrity with lipid oxidation provides some insight, the drastically different results with two samples containing virtually identical moisture contents makes it difficult to attribute our findings solely to alterations in residual water. Some of our most recent work has demonstrated the stabilizing effects of incorporating surfactants into lipoplex formulations during acute lyophilization stress. 44 The current study included an investigation of the effects of Tween 80 (40 \u00b5M) on the storage stability of lipoplex formulations, but we observed that oxidation during storage was dramatically increased in the presence of Tween 80 (data not shown). We suspect that the rapid deterioration of samples formulated with Tween 80 was due to the tendency of this unsaturated detergent to participate in oxidation, and future studies will investigate this hypothesis. Regardless, our previous study documenting the beneficial effects of surfactants suggests that surface interactions may contribute to the damage observed in lipoplex formulations. 44 Therefore, it seemed possible that preparing samples with different water contents by altering secondary drying temperatures (the method used in this study) might result in different surface areas of the dried cake which may contribute to the observed degradation. Accordingly, the surface areas of cakes prepared under these conditions were assessed with BET measurements. Our BET data at Time 0 indicate that cakes secondary dried at \u221210 \u00b0C had the lowest surface area (0.49 m 2 /g) followed by cakes secondary dried at 5 \u00b0C (0.88 m 2 /g), 0 \u00b0C (1.10 m 2 /g) and 20 \u00b0C (2.35 m 2 /g). BET measurements were not conducted after storage, so it is possible that additional changes in surface area occurred during storage, although no changes in cake structure were detectable by eye. From these results, we see a trend of greater degradation with higher surface areas that may explain the differences in stability observed in the two preparations with equivalent moisture content. Previous studies on the stability of dried food have suggested an interplay between moisture content and surface area such that oxidation is minimized when sufficient water is available for monolayer coverage. [28] [29] [30] A straightforward calculation reveals that our moisture contents are at least 5-fold higher than that necessary for monolayer coverage, even in our driest samples. However, such an analysis assumes that water molecules are only present on the surface of the sample; an assumption that is clearly invalid for a glassy system. Regardless, the idea that monolayer coverage of the surface might reduce oxidation is consistent with our previous work suggesting a role for surfaces in facilitating degradation during lyophilization. 44 Differences in surface area may explain why our previous study investigating preparations at two different water contents showed higher stability at the lower moisture content, in contrast to the current study. 11 However, it should be noted that the highest moisture content employed in our previous study was comparable to the intermediate moistures investigated in this study. Nonetheless, our results with two preparations exhibiting very different stabilities despite virtually identical water contents suggest that more studies on the effect of surface area on dry state storage stability of lipoplexes are warranted.",

[45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] This work has clearly demonstrated that reductions in surface area by various mechanisms (e.g., annealing, incorporation of surfactants, foam drying) consistently result in greater storage stability in the dried state. Although different approaches promote surface accumulation of the active component to different extents, improved storage stability appears to correlate with lower amounts of surface exposure. These authors have explained that the total degradation rate is the sum of that experienced by the surface-exposed protein and protein buried within the glassy matrix. Furthermore, Pikal and colleagues argue that surface-exposed proteins are more susceptible to damage, and thus lowering the surface area of the dried cakes reduces the fraction of proteins on the surface. This straightforward mechanism likely contributes to our findings with lipoplexes, however the degradation we observe does not strictly correlate with surface area, suggesting that moisture content plays a role in stability that is independent of its effects on surface area. Furthermore, the correlation we observe between loss of supercoil content and aldehyde production indicates that oxidation ultimately limits storage stability, suggesting that both surface area and moisture content contribute to rates of oxidation in the dried state.",
