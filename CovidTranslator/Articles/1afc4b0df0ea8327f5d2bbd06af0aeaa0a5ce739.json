If we document a large increase in potentially avoidable cardiac deaths from unavailable procedures, then difficult but necessary discussions about allocation of resources to infection vs. emergent cardiovascular procedures will be crucial; 2)Certain cardiac catheterization staff with comorbidities associated with adverse events in the setting of contracting COVID-19 (age >60 years, diabetes, hypertension, or pre-existing cardiovascular disease) may wish to refrain from procedures with an increased risk of aerosolization if adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) cannot be provided. Depending on their level of competency and in accordance with their training programs, trainees may also wish to refrain from cardiac catheterization procedures; 3) PPE use, including correct donning and doffing, changing scrubs and showering between cases with a high likelihood of COVID-19, and changing civilian clothes and footwear upon entering and leaving the hospital will remain our best defence during the pandemic 5 ; 4) The threshold for performing percutaneous vs surgical coronary and valvular interventions may vary as the pandemic escalates and abates.After review by the Heart Team, multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI) or MitralClip may be appropriate to facilitate hospital discharge and reduce length of stay (LOS); 5) In the setting of ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI) or other situations requiring emergent cardiac catheterization, pre-hospital screening for symptoms of influenza-like illnesses, pre-existing knowledge of COVID-19",
