An estimated one million people in the U. S. have this disease. Based on the current U.S. population of 315,556,000, there will be approximately 38,605 new cases of sarcoidosis this year and just over 1000 (2.6%) will die of the illness. 1, 2 The fundamental pathologic abnormality in the disease is the formation of non-caseating epitheliod granulomas, which usually confine poorly soluble foreign material that simply cannot be removed by a single phagocytic cell. The key feature in sarcoidosis is activated CD4+ T cells which differentiate into type 1 helper T cells (Th1), secreting interleukin-2 and interferon-\u03b3, augmenting macrophage TNF-\u03b1, and amplifying the local cellular immune response. 3, 4 This granulomatous inflammation interferes with local tissue homeostasis leading to organ impairment.",

Early studies reported associations with non-infective agents including beryllium, zirconium, aluminum, wood-burning stoves, tree pollen, clay soil, talc, insecticides, inorganic particles, and moldy environments, but none of these theoretical causes has endured. 3, 5, 6 There is also a several-fold increased incidence of sarcoidosis occurring in siblings and parents, as well as a consistent strong association with specific gene products such as class I and class II HLA antigens, which may add to the familial connection.",

All patients with lymph nodes containing bacteria DNA on presentation were also highly symptomatic and 75% of them had the poorer-prognosis radiographic stage II findings. Moreover, after a median 4 years follow-up, all bacterial DNA-positive patients were still highly symptomatic. This striking correlation strongly suggests that demonstration of bacterial DNA by PCR in lymph nodes on initial presentation is an adverse prognostic factor and makes it unlikely that these patients will have a spontaneous remission.

Numerous non-infective agents have been implicated based on epidemiologic basis but none have stood up to scrutiny. 1, 3, 5 The focus over the last two decades has been on infective agents that might trigger sarcoidosis, with the strongest suspects found in the mycobacteria family and the common commensal Propionibacterium acnes. And like classical tuberculosis where up to 90% of people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remain in remission without treatment, 17 sarcoidosis also has a 65-80% spontaneous remission rate without treatment. 1 One may speculate that similar to tuberculosis, the immune system, after its initial response to a triggering microorganism, is successful in eradicating the agent and the immune response subsides. Then in the 20% or so with persistent and progressive sarcoidosis, the organism remains viable and perpetuates the destructive immune response.",

Sixty years ago a number of small trials using classical anti-tuberculous drugs (isoniazide, streptomycin, or cortisone) were published with discouraging results. 26 However, atypical mycobacteria (rather than M. tuberculosis) that are more likely to be one of the etiologic agents in sarcoidosis, are almost all resistant to the standard anti-tuberculosis agents such as isoniazid. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] And if other organisms such as Proprionibacterium acnes or perhaps cell-wall deficient (L-forms) bacteria trigger and perpetuate sarcoidosis in some individuals, then the standard anti-tuberculous drugs would also be ineffective.",

And like classical tuberculosis where up to 90% of people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remain in remission without treatment, 20 sarcoidosis also has a 65-80% spontaneous remission rate without treatment. 1 One may speculate that similar to tuberculosis, the immune system, after its initial response to a triggering microorganism, is successful in eradicating the agent and the immune response subsides.

[24] [25] [26] In fact, many in the field suspect that this intracellular organism (MAP) that resides in the macrophage impairs the normal autophagy that would usually eradicate the organism. 24 Agents that enhance autophagy such as 16\u03b1-bromoepiandersterone, 27, 28 currently in human trials, may prove effective along with antibiotics in Crohn's disease. 24 Can some antibacterial/anti-mycobacterial regimen such as that used in Crohn's disease alter the natural history of sarcoidosis in chronically symptomatic patients? Sixty years ago a number of small trials using classical anti-tuberculous drugs (isoniazide, streptomycin, or cortisone) were published with discouraging results. 29 However, atypical mycobacteria (rather than M. tuberculosis) that are more likely to be one of the etiologic agents in sarcoidosis, are almost all resistant to the standard anti-tuberculosis agents such as isoniazid. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] And if other organisms such as Proprionibacterium acnes or perhaps cell-wall deficient (L-forms) bacteria trigger and perpetuate sarcoidosis in some individuals, then the standard anti-tuberculous drugs would also be ineffective.",

            "text": "Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease primarily involving the lungs, lymph nodes and other organs that appears to be the result of an exuberant T cell and macrophage immunologic response to the continued presentation of a poorly degradable antigen. Numerous non-infective agents have been implicated based on epidemiologic basis but none have stood up to scrutiny. 1, 3, 5 The focus over the last two decades has been on infective agents that might trigger sarcoidosis, with the strongest suspects found in the mycobacteria family and the common commensal Propionibacterium acnes. And like classical tuberculosis where up to 90% of people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remain in remission without treatment, 20 sarcoidosis also has a 65-80% spontaneous remission rate without treatment. 1 One may speculate that similar to tuberculosis, the immune system, after its initial response to a triggering microorganism, is successful in eradicating the agent and the immune response subsides. Then in the 20% or so with persistent and progressive sarcoidosis, the organism remains viable and perpetuates the destructive immune response. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 23 Although the classical treatment of Crohn's disease has been with immunosuppressive agents just like with sarcoidosis, many recent studies suggest a much more effective treatment with less side effects may be a triple antibiotic regimen geared toward the putative triggering agent MAP. [24] [25] [26] In fact, many in the field suspect that this intracellular organism (MAP) that resides in the macrophage impairs the normal autophagy that would usually eradicate the organism. 24 Agents that enhance autophagy such as 16\u03b1-bromoepiandersterone, 27, 28 currently in human trials, may prove effective along with antibiotics in Crohn's disease. 24 Can some antibacterial/anti-mycobacterial regimen such as that used in Crohn's disease alter the natural history of sarcoidosis in chronically symptomatic patients? Sixty years ago a number of small trials using classical anti-tuberculous drugs (isoniazide, streptomycin, or cortisone) were published with discouraging results. 29 However, atypical mycobacteria (rather than M. tuberculosis) that are more likely to be one of the etiologic agents in sarcoidosis, are almost all resistant to the standard anti-tuberculosis agents such as isoniazid. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] And if other organisms such as Proprionibacterium acnes or perhaps cell-wall deficient (L-forms) bacteria trigger and perpetuate sarcoidosis in some individuals, then the standard anti-tuberculous drugs would also be ineffective. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 The tetracycline derivatives (minocycline and doxycycline), as well as the anti-malarial drug chloroquine have been shown to be quite effective in treating cutaneous sarcoidosis. 36 Minocycline can produce complete responses in up two-thirds of cases, although it is debated whether this is an anti-microbial effect or an immunomodulating effect. 37 Attention has recently turned to randomized sarcoidosis treatment trials with various anti- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Minocycline can produce complete responses in up two-thirds of cases, although it is debated whether this is an anti-microbial effect or an immunomodulating effect.",

Persistently symptomatic patients worsen with a disabling, potentially fatal clinical course. To determine a possible infectious cause, we correlated in a case control study clinical information with the presence of bacterial DNA in sarcoidosis mediastinal lymph nodes compared to control lymph nodes resected during cancer surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively studied formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, mediastinal lymph nodes from 30 sarcoidosis patients and 30 control lung cancer patients. Nucleic acids were extracted from nodes, were evaluated by rRNA PCR for bacterial 16S rDNA, and the result was sequenced and compared to a bacterial sequence library. Clinical information was correlated. RESULTS: 11/30 (36.7%) of lymph nodes from sarcoidosis patients had detectable bacterial DNA, significantly more than control patient lymph nodes (2/30, 6.7%), p = 0.00516. At presentation, 19/30 (63.3%) sarcoidosis patients were symptomatic including all patients with detectable bacterial DNA. Radiographically, there were 18 Stage I and 12 Stage II patients. All Stage II patients were symptomatic and 75% had PCR-detectable bacteria. After a mean followup of 52.8 + 32.8 months, all patients with PCR-detectable bacteria in this series were persistently symptomatic requiring treatment. DISCUSSION: 36.6% of sarcoidosis patients had detectable bacteria DNA on presentation, all of these patients were quite symptomatic, and most were radiographically-advanced stage II. patients.

Nevertheless, the condition is relatively common with a significantly higher ageadjusted annual incidence in African-Americans (35.5 cases per 100,000) versus Caucasian-Americans (10.9 cases per 100,000). An estimated one million people in the U. S. have this disease. Based on the current U.S. population of 315,556,000, there will be approximately 38,605 new cases of sarcoidosis this year and just over 1000 (2.6%) will die of the illness. 1,2",
