            "text": "Human scabies is a highly contagious, globally prevalent, parasitic skin infestation caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis, also known as the itch mite. This parasite was identified in the 1687 by Bonomo and Cestoni using a light microscope; however, there is evidence of scabies as far back as 1200 BCE. 1 The most common symptoms of scabies, itching and a skin rash, are caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to the proteins and feces of the parasite about four to six weeks after infestation. Severe pruritus, especially at night, is the earliest and most common symptom of scabies. An erythematous, papular, pruritic rash with burrows on the hands, wrists, torso, and feet is also common. 1 Scabies continues to be a common dermatological disease internationally. A systematic review estimated the prevalence of scabies in various countries to be 0.2% to 71%. 2 In the United Kingdom, a general practice database review for scabies estimated prevalence to be 2.2 and 2.8 per 1000 in men and women, respectively. 3 Studies from Greece and Spain conducted in dermatology clinics concluded that scabies is encountered in approximately 4% of visits, particularly among immigrants and patients with low socioeconomic status. 4, 5 In developing countries the prevalence can be much higher, [6] [7] [8] [9] ranging as high as 87% in one study in Thai orphanages. 10 Although prevalence of scabies is low in developed countries, public health authorities are challenged to identify and treat individuals with scabies promptly to avoid transmission amongst close-quartered populations, such as within the growing population of asylum seekers and refugees. 11, 12 Scabies remains a risk to public health, and it is essential that frontline healthcare providers identify potential cases. Both under-and over-diagnosis are possible, and each is problematic. While missing the diagnosis can lead to both ongoing individual patient discomfort as well as rapid population spread, over-diagnosis can lead to inappropriate individual patient treatment and can create stress on healthcare systems with finite resources. Emergency Department (ED) providers may encounter and treat these patients as the first point of contact. After an overview of the disease and critical information pertaining to transmission and treatment, this article adapts the 3I (Identify-Isolate-Inform) Tool to assist frontline providers in the identification and management of potential cases of scabies presenting to the ED (Figure 1 ). The 3I Tool was originally developed for Ebola virus disease and subsequently modified for use in measles, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), mumps, Zika, hepatitis A, pertussis, and 2019 nCoV .

When people are first infested with scabies, they usually have no symptoms for 4-6 weeks. Classically, an intense nocturnal pruritic rash is the first symptom. The rash is typically characterized as erythematous with papules and associated burrows. Burrows are described as thin grey or brown lines that are approximately 5 mm long. Presence of burrows is a classic finding of scabies but uncommonly visualized due to skin excoriation or the presence of secondary infections. In adults and older children, the rash is most commonly found in the volar aspect of the wrists, interdigital web spaces, periumbilical area, anterior axillary folds, buttocks, and genitalia. 21 In infants and those who live in tropical areas, the rash can be generalized and may also involve the scalp, neck, face, palms, and soles. 22",

However, achieving a definitive diagnosis depends on identification of mites, eggs, or fecal material using light microscopy. Lesions should be scraped off using a scalpel. With the scalpel, the papule should be scraped multiple times to remove the top (Video Example: Scabies skin scraping technique). Adding a few drops of mineral oil to the skin prior to scraping may help the scraped material to adhere to the blade. Most hospital pathology laboratories will accept scrapings for microscopic evaluations. The pathology protocols for scabies skin scraping methods at two university hospitals are provided here for reference: University of Iowa and University of Michigan. The characteristic microscopic appearance is shown here. Even with ideal technique, however, failure to find mites, eggs, or fecal material is common and does not rule out the disease. 26, 27 The sensitivity of this approach ranges from 40% to 90% and the specificity reaches 100%. 26 Alternatively, the burrow ink test may be used. In this method, ink is absorbed by the burrows and will be visible as wavy lines ( Figure 2 ). 24, 25 This method requires a dark felt tip washable marker or a fountain pen over the affected area and an alcohol swab to clean the surface ink. Any remaining dark ink under the skin signifies presence of scabies burrows ( Figure 2 ). The sensitivity and specificity for the burrow ink test is unable to be calculated based on a French dermatology study. 26 Nevertheless, for any case with concern for scabies in Cheng et al.",

Similar to the ink, the topical tetracycline solution is applied over an affected area, and is wiped with alcohol to remove any excess solution on the surface. Then a Wood's lamp is used to visualize the tetracycline that tracked into the burrows. 28 Other scabies diagnostic techniques unlikely to be used in the emergency department include video dermatoscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and IgE antibody testing. Video dermatoscopy is especially useful in cases with atypical distribution or appearance of the lesions. 30 Serological tests are emerging for both diagnosis and monitoring of treatment efficacy. One study showed that real-time PCR and ELISA tests are useful for monitoring treatment efficacy. 31 Another study reported a 100% sensitivity and a specificity of 93% using IgE antibody against Sarcoptes scabiei. 32",

Streptococcus or staphylococcus infections can cause impetigo, paronychia, cellulitis, or abscesses. 33 Sequelae of these bacterial infections include bacteremia leading to sepsis, acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and rheumatic heart disease. 22, 33 The most vulnerable populations to scabies infestations are young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. These populations are especially susceptible to secondary complications of infestation. Given transmission is favored in conditions of crowding and poor sanitation, outbreaks have been seen in refugee camps and asylum seeker shelters. 12 Crusted scabies, also known as Norwegian scabies, is particularly serious with a high mortality rate from bacterial sepsis. 34 Caused by a hyperinfestation of the scabies mites, crusted scabies is characterized by development of a severe inflammatory response and hyperkeratosis (thickened skin crusts). 35 Any skin area might be affected, but commonly affected regions include the scalp, hands, and feet. Crusts are malodorous and nails are thickened and discolored. Most cases of the crusted variant are linked to immunocompromised hosts; however, cases of crusted scabies have occurred without identifiable risk factors. 35 From a public health perspective, patients with crusted scabies are highly infectious and, given they carry a significant number of mites, they can be the primary source of a community scabies outbreak. Furthermore, crusted scabies is difficult to manage, often requiring multiple treatments. 35",

The lifecycle begins with a female mite laying eggs in the skin burrows. These larvae hatch, create new burrows, and then mature, mate and repeat this cycle. 1 Once infested with scabies mites, symptomatic patients as well as asymptomatic carriers can easily spread the disease. 1, 36 Commonly, transmission occurs from person to person via direct skin contact, including by sexual contact. Because of the asymptomatic period following infestation, transmission can occur prior to symptom onset. 1 In addition, fomite transmission through infested objects such as furniture and clothing is possible, especially with the crusted variant of scabies. 1, 36 Outside the human body and at room temperature with normal humidity, mites can only survive up to 3 days, whereas they are able to live up to 60 days inside human skin. 1,36 Lower temperatures and higher humidity prolong survival of the mite off the host. 23 To prevent transmission within healthcare facilities, patients should be in contact isolation until 8 hours after treatment. 36 Personal protective equipment for healthcare workers treating patients with scabies includes the following: gowns, gloves, and shoe covers. 36 Proper use of infection control measures including handwashing and avoiding skinto-skin contact should also be used when handling patients with potential scabies infestations.",

In general, medications consist of a scabicide that can be applied topically or taken orally. For classic scabies, topical permethrin or oral ivermectin are considered first-line treatments. 23 Dosing regimens are included in the table. Although high-quality trials comparing medications for the treatment of scabies are lacking, a Cochrane systematic review concluded that permethrin is more effective than ivermectin. 37 A more recent 2018 systematic review, however, concluded that both ivermectin and permethrin have similar efficacy. 38 When used as directed, topical permethrin 5% has high cure rates, approaching 90% in randomized trials. 39 Permethrin is applied topically in patients older than 2 months of age from the neck to the soles of the feet and washed off after 8 to 14 hours. Considering that scabies can also affect the face, scalp and neck in infants and young children, topical application should be extended to these areas. 36, 40 Repeating the topical permethrin treatment one or two weeks after the first treatment is necessary in severe cases. 36 Oral ivermectin is an alternate therapy that may be used if topical treatment fails; however, its safety in pregnant women and children weighing less than 15 kg has not been established. 34, 46, 37, [41] [42] [43] For crusted scabies, both an oral and a topical scabicide should be administered concurrently (Table) . 15, 19, 37 Ivermectin use has also been described for scabies control in endemic areas or outbreaks where topical scabicide use may be difficult. 12 A randomized controlled trial examining mass administration of ivermectin for management of scabies concluded a reduction in prevalence from 32.1% to 1.9% in the ivermectin group compared to a reduction from 41.7% to 15.8% in permethrin-treated controls. 44 Other topical agents such as sulfur, benzyl benzoate, crotamiton, and lindane are also options if first-line treatments fail. Topical sulfur is considered safe when used to treat infants younger than 2 months of age and pregnant women. 36, 40, 41 In addition to scabicides, treatment of secondary bacterial infections such as pyoderma or impetigo, if present, is indicated via administration of appropriate systemic antibiotics. 36 Advising patients and parents of young patients to keep fingernails short and clean can assist with preventing secondary infections.",

In these cases, numerous contacts may need treatment to prevent a large-scale outbreak. 35, 41 In communities with a high prevalence of scabies, mass drug administration of scabicides has been used for effective control. This may be a strategy for large outbreaks; however, local health authorities should be consulted prior to instituting this approach. 48",
