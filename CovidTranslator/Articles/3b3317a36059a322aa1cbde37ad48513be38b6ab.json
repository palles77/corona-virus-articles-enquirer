This study was to determine whether the damage was correlated with expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in different organs, especially in the endocrine tissues of the pancreas, and to elucidate the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance in SARS patients. The effect of clinical variables on survival was estimated in 135 SARS patients who died, 385 hospitalized SARS patients who survived, and 19 patients with non-SARS pneumonia. A total of 39 SARS patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment were compared to 39 matched healthy siblings during a 3-year follow-up period. The pattern of SARS coronavirus receptor-ACE2 proteins in different human organs was also studied. Significant elevations in oxygen saturation, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase MB isoenzyme, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), but not in alanine transaminase were predictors for death. Abundant ACE2 immunostaining was found in lung, kidney, heart, and islets of pancreas, but not in hepatocytes. Twenty of the 39 followed-up patients were diabetic during hospitalization. After 3 years, only two of these patients had diabetes. Compared with their non-SARS siblings, these patients exhibited no significant differences in FPG, postprandial glucose (PPG), and insulin levels. The organ involvements of SARS correlated with organ expression of ACE2. The localization of ACE2 expression in the endocrine part of the pancreas suggests that SARS coronavirus enters islets using ACE2 as its receptor and damages islets causing acute diabetes.",

In the journal Diabetic Medicine in 2006, we reported that ambient hyperglycemia was an independent predictor for mortality and morbidity in SARS patients. Although hyperglycemia was a predictor for mortality in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with acute illnesses, its association with SARS looked quite different. Even patients with mild SARS who did not use any glucocorticoid medications during the disease course had a higher level of FPG on the first day of hospitalization than those who were initially suspected of having SARS but later diagnosed with non-SARS pneumonia [1] . Acute damage to pancreatic b-cells by coronavirus may occur during systemic illness. However, experimental studies are needed to test this hypothesis.",

An investigation of ACE2 protein localization in 15 human organs found that ACE2 was abundant in the epithelia of lung and small intestine, where SARS-CoV might enter [9] . Another investigation of 72 human tissues by Harmer and his colleagues [10] confirmed ACE2 mRNA expression in bronchus, lung parenchyma, ileum, testis, and cardiovascular, renal, and gastrointestinal tissues, and pancreas. Fig. 1 a Probability of event free (no death) survival among SARS patients divided into two groups [yes (red line) and no (green line)] for old age (C60 years), male gender, anemia (Hb \\10 for men and \\9 for women), thrombocytopenia (\\80 9 10 9 per l), low level of CD4 (\\200) or CD8 (\\150) lymphocytes, clinically significant elevation of ALT (C80 IU/l), AST (C80 IU/l), LDH (C250 IU/l), s-Cr (C106 lmol/l for men and C97 lmol/l for women), hypoxia (SaO 2 \\93%), and hyperglycemia (FPG C7.0 mmol/l). b Multivariate baseline predictors of death including old age (C60 years), elevated ALT (C80 IU/l), elevated LDH (C250 IU/l) and hyperglycemia (FPG C7.0 mmol/l) among the SARS patients, presented by hazard ratio and 95% CI The multi-system nature of SARS infection has been demonstrated in several autopsy studies [11] [12] [13] . These studies demonstrated atypical pathological changes, such as hydropic degeneration, fatty degeneration, and interstitial cell proliferation involving the liver, heart, kidney, and pancreas, in patients suspected of having died from SARS. In one study of alimentary tract and digestive glands from seven SARS autopsies, routine pathology, electron microscopy (EM), in situ hybridization (ISH), immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), found no evidence of direct viral infection in the liver or pancreas [14] . In another study of patients who died of SARS, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (using a murine monoclonal antibody specific for SARS-CoV nucleoprotein and probes specific for a SARS-CoV RNA polymerase gene fragment, respectively) found SARS-CoV mainly in the lung and distal convoluted renal tubule, and to a much lesser extent in the pancreas and liver [15] . Interestingly, ACE2 mRNA was detectable at low levels in rat liver and increased following bile duct ligation (363-fold). And in healthy livers, ACE2 protein was confined to endothelial cells, occasional bile ducts, and perivenular hepatocytes but in human cirrhosis there was widespread parenchymal expression (97-fold) of ACE2 protein [16] .",

Abundant ACE2 immunostaining was found in alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, parietal epithelial cells of the kidney, myocardium of the heart, but not in hepatocytes. These differences in ACE2 expression in different organs were consistent with our findings showing ) . b Negative immunostaining control shows no non-specific staining especially caused by endogenous biotin. c Expression of ACE2 in pancreas as assessed by immunohistochemistry shows endocrine tissue is strongly positive compared with exocrine tissue. d Lung: marked ACE2 immunostaining was found in type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, and capillary endothelium. e Kidney: ACE2 was very weakly present in glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium, but strongly present in the brush border and cytoplasm of proximal tubular cells, and in the cytoplasm of distal tubules and collecting ducts. f Heart: ACE2 was present in the myocytes, myocardium, border zone, endothelium of small-to-large arteries as well as sporadically within the smooth muscle of these vessels. g Liver: K\u00fcpffer cells, hepatocytes, and the endothelium of sinusoids were negative differences in survival associated with elevations in various parameters. Significant elevation in levels of AST, LDH, and s-Cr, and severe hypoxia were associated with higher death rate, which suggested SARS damaged several organs including heart, kidney, and lung. However, significant elevation of ALT, an indicator of liver damage, was not associated with higher mortality. Our results implied that the higher the level of expression, the greater the level of damage by SARS-CoV. Interestingly, hyperglycemia as another possible reason for higher death rate was supported by our idea that coronavirus acutely damaged the pancreatic islets leading to hyperglycemia. Consistent with our finding that pancreatic islets are strongly immunopositive for ACE2 while exocrine tissues are only weakly positive, there are almost no reports of pancreatitis in patients with SARS.",

Patients with marked increase in AST (49% [25/51] vs. 15.0% [62/413], P \\ 0.0001), LDH (37.9% [64/169] vs. 3.9% [11/281], P \\ 0.0001), and s-Cr (60.0% [27/45] vs. 15.6 [63/405], P \\ 0.0001), which is consistent with severe hypoxia (31.6% [84/266] vs. 16.7% [42/252], P \\ 0.0001), also had higher death rate, suggesting multiorgan (e.g., heart, kidney and lung) damage by SARS. Mortality was also higher in patients with hyperglycemia (another parameter with a higher endpoint; 38.0% [71/187] vs. 9.8 [27/275], P \\ 0.0001), suggesting that SARS caused lesions in the pancreatic islets. Interestingly, mortality was not higher in patients with high ALT (an indicator of liver damage) (23.3% [14/60] vs. 18.3% [74/405], P = 0.35).",
