Materials and methods: This was a single-center prospective randomized study. All patients undergoing FOBguided nasal tracheal intubation were randomized to bag-valve-mask ventilation or NIV for preoxygenation followed by intubation. The NIV group were intubated through a sealed hole in a specially designed face mask during continuous NIV support with 100% oxygen. Control patients were intubated with removal of the mask and no ventilatory support. Results: We enrolled 106 patients, including 53 in each group. Pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) after preoxygenation (99% (96%-100%) vs. 96% (90%-99%), p = .001) and minimum SpO 2 during intubation (95% (87%-100%) vs. 83% (74%-91%), p b .01) were both significantly higher in the NIV compared with the control group. Severe hypoxemic events (SpO 2 b 80%) occurred less frequently in the NIV group than in controls (7.4% vs. 37.7%, respectively; p b .01). Conclusions: Continuous NIV support during FOB-guided nasal intubation can prevent severe desaturation during intubation in critically ill patients with respiratory failure.

            "text": "Tracheal intubation of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with multiple complications, such as severe hypoxemia [1] [2] [3] . Preoxygenation is commonly used to prevent severe oxygen desaturation during intubation and is effective in patients requiring elective intubation for anesthesia [4] . However, it is less effective in critically ill patients [5] , and severe hypoxemia is the most common complication contributing to the increased mortality of critically ill patients [6] . More efficient preoxygenation and maintaining ventilatory support during intubation can theoretically help to prevent hypoxemia. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is currently a common first-line management technique for reducing the need for intubation in patients with respiratory failure [7] [8] [9] . However, when NIV fails, intubation is inevitable. With conventional intubation, the NIV mask must be removed from the patient to perform the intubation. Nasotracheal intubation is commonly used in patients undergoing surgery, but this practice is less common in the ICU due to the risk of sinusitis [10, 11] . Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB)-guided nasotracheal intubation is still frequently used for intubating critically ill patients in China. We hypothesized that the use of a specially-designed NIV face mask would permit continuous NIV support during FOB-guided nasotracheal intubation, thus minimizing oxygen desaturation during intubation. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of continuous NIV support with 100% oxygen using a specially designed face mask for reducing desaturation during intubation. The primary outcome was the effectiveness of continuous NIV support during FOB-guided intubation in preventing severe desaturation in critically ill patients with respiratory failure.",

BVM preoxygenation was performed with a BVM driven by 15 l/min oxygen flow (Galemed Corporation, I-Lan, Taiwan), an oxygen reservoir was added to the balloon, and positive end-expiratory pressure was set at 5 cmH 2 O. After preoxygenation, the mask had to be removed to allow FOB intubation, and oxygen could only be delivered through the nasal prong with no assisted ventilation during this period. NIV preoxygenation was performed with NIV support (BiPAP Vision\u00ae; Philips, Best, Netherlands) with the following settings: mode, S/T; f, 20/min; inspiratory positive airway pressure, 12-20 cmH 2 O (adjusted to obtain an expired tidal volume of 7-10 ml/kg); expiratory positive airway pressure, 5 cmH 2 O; and FiO 2 , 100%. A speciallydesigned face mask was used to allow FOB-guided nasal intubation to be carried out through a hole in the mask during NIV support. The masks were well sealed in both groups, with special attention paid to ensure patient-ventilator synchronization.",

            "text": "Critically ill patients in the ICU often have underlying cardiopulmonary disease, multiple comorbidities, or serious complications, and are therefore at higher risk of developing severe hypoxemia during intubation, compared with patients receiving elective intubation for anesthesia and surgery [3, 12, 13] . Severe hypoxemia is considered to be the most important factor for patient safety during intubation. During conventional intubation, BVM ventilation must be interrupted during laryngoscopic intubation. Although a brief period of apnea is safe after proper preoxygenation in most patients, individuals with preexisting pulmonary disorders may develop severe hypoxemia very rapidly, and maintaining ventilatory support and oxygen supply during intubation may thus be beneficial for patients at risk of severe hypoxemia. Casey et al. showed that using BVM ventilation in critically ill patients between induction and laryngoscopy resulted in higher oxygen saturation and a lower incidence of severe hypoxemia compared with patients receiving no ventilation [14] . Miguel-Montanes et al. reported that highflow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygenation significantly improved preoxygenation and reduced the prevalence of severe hypoxemia during tracheal intubation compared with BVM [15] . However, HFNC only provides constant oxygen flow through the nose during oral intubation. The mechanism resulting in reduced oxygen desaturation during tracheal intubation is referred to as the 'apneic oxygenation' effect [16, 17] . HFNC has no effect in providing ventilatory support, and another study showed that HFNC had no effect on reducing oxygen desaturation during intubation [18] . Semler et al. compared HFNC with conventional laryngoscopic intubation and found that HFNC had no benefit on arterial oxygenation in critically ill patients [19] . Current evidence thus suggests that HFNC may have minimal effect on maintaining oxygenation during intubation in critically ill patients [15, 18, 20] . NIV has been shown to improve ventilation and oxygenation in patients with respiratory failure secondary to a variety of etiologies, thus reducing the need for intubation [21, 22] . FOB with NIV support reduced oxygen desaturation in hypoxemic patients [23] [24] [25] . NIV has also been used for preoxygenation, resulting in better preoxygenation and less oxygen desaturation during subsequent intubation [26] . However, conventional intubation requires the withdrawal of NIV, which might attenuate its effect. To resolve this problem, Barjaktarevic et al. reported continuous nasal NIV during FOB-assisted oral tracheal intubation and showed that NIV improved SpO 2 during intubation [27] ; however in their study, the NIV face mask used for preoxygenation had to be replaced with a nasal mask, thus disrupting ventilation. Furthermore, the patient's mouth remains open during oral intubation, which also interferes with the efficacy of nasal NIV.",

Aspiration is one of the most concerning complications of NIV and endotracheal intubation [13, 26] . NIV may result in gastric distension secondary to positive airway pressure in critically ill patients, thus increasing the risk of gastric regurgitation and aspiration during intubation. The risk of regurgitation increases if the inspiratory pressure is N20 cmH 2 O, which is easily achieved by conventional BVM [31] . In the current study however, the inspiratory pressure did not exceed 20 cm H 2 O during NIV, and there was no evidence of regurgitation based on clinical observations and bronchoscopy.",

Second, FOB-guided nasotracheal intubation was used in all patients in the study because this has been a routine intubation technique in our ICU since 1993, and we therefore did not evaluate the technique in patients with oral intubation. However, FOBguided nasotracheal intubation is a common practice in critically ill patients, and the primary outcome of our study was the effectiveness of continuous NIV support during FOB-guided intubation for preventing severe desaturation in critically ill patients. The results prove that the concept and methodology of continuous NIV support with 100% oxygen during the whole process of intubation was possible and effectively reduced severe desaturation in critically ill patients. Further studies should be conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique during oral intubation. Third, severe sinusitis related to nasal intubation was not evaluated carefully in our study. However, a prospective comparative study between oral and nasal intubations is necessary to clarify the impact of sinusitis in nasally intubated patients. Fourth, we recruited 106 cases, which exceeded the planned 86 cases; however, during the course of the study, we considered that some of the included cases might be invalid, with incomplete data. The calculated number of subjects required for the study might also be affected by the rate of severe desaturation. We therefore increased the number of cases.",
