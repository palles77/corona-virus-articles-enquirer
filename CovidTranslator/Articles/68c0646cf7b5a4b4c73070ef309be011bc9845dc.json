            "text": "Sepsis usually progress quickly, severe sepsis and septic shock are the main cause of death in noncardiac critically patients. 1 About 50% of patients with sepsis appeared varying degrees of myocardial depression, and the mortality can be as high as 70% to 90%. 2 The research reported that the myocardial organic damage had existed in early sepsis, and low blood pressure, arrhythmias and heart failure easily appeared in these patients. 3 Therefore, it is an important significant to timely administer effective medicine to patients with septic myocardial injury. The traditional medicine in treatment of infectious diseases has a long history. Xuebijing injection is anintravenous solution prepared with a formula from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The formula consists of Chishao (Radix Paeoniae Rubra), Danggui (Radix Angelicae Sinensis), Chuanxiong (Rhizoma Chuanxiong), Honghua (Flos Carthami), and Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae), so it with the efficacy of activating blood circulation to remove blood stasis, cooling the blood and clearing the toxic heat. 4 Xuebijing injection is initially used for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which caused by coronavirus. But today it is widely used in kinds of critically ill patients, including endotoxemia, circulatory and respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction and so on. 5, 6 We used Xuebijing injection in patients with septic myocardial injury, to observe its effect on the level of cardiac troponin \u2160 (cTnI), N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and procalcitonin (PCT), to explore its protective effect on myocardial injury in patients.",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the effect of Xuebijing Injection on myocardial injury in patients with sepsis in terms of cTnI, NT-proBNP, PCT, ICU length of stay, and mortality in 28 days. cTnI is a structural protein on striated muscle, and only exists in myocardial cells. It can influence the activity of atpase through binding to calcium ions to regulate interaction of actin and myosin, and induce myocardial contraction and relaxation. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a neuropeptide hormone secreted by ventricular myocytes, with role of promote sodium, diuresis and expand blood vessels. When ventricular myocytes endure stretch, proB-NP is rapidly released into the blood, and cleaved into same molar amount of biologically active BNP and in-active NTproBNP. 9 PCT is a glycoprotein, which is very low in healthy human blood, so it is hardly detected. PCT is an ideal indicator of inflammation, which is the best marker for clinical diagnosis of sepsis. 10, 11 PCT significantly increases in severe bacterial infections, while it does not increase during local infection, viral infection, chronic non-specific inflammation, cancer fever or autoimmune disease. Comparison with other inflammatory markers. Clinical studies suggest that Xuebijing injection had effects of antagonizing endotoxin, adjusting immune response, antagonizing inflammatory cytokines, improving microcirculation and protecting endothelial cells. 12 In this study, at 3, 7 and 10-day after treatment, the levels of cTnI, NT-proBNP and PCT in treatment group improved better than those of control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05), and the change trends of three markers were similar. Those results illustrated Xuebijing injection had a protective effect on septic myocardial injury. At the same time, it could improve prognosis in patients with sepsis. In addition, the length of stay in ICU of treatment group was shorter than that of control group, and the difference was statistically significant. In conclusion, Xuebijing injection improved prognosis in patients with sepsis. An important limitation is that this study was a two-center controlled trial study, so a multicenter controlled trial is needed to further confirm the effects of Xuebijing injection in septic myocardial injury. In addition, this study is a preliminary study, it is necessary to extend the time of observation for accurately evaluate the effects of Xuebijing injection in future research.
