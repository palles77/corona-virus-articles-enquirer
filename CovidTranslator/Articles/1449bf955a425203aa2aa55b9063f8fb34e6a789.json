This approach is seen with the nucleoside and nucleotide analog inhibitors of the herpesvirus DNA polymerases, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase inhibitors, the HIV protease inhibitors, and the influenza hemagglutinin inhibitors (De Clercq, 1995; Kinchington and Redshaw, 1995; Haffey and Field, 1995; Field, 1994) . It is apparent that this approach has resulted in a parade of clinically effective drugs, the best examples in the success story being acyclovir (ACV), which has been used both therapeutically and prophylactically to inhibit acute herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesion formation and duration, and zidovudine (AZT). But as successfu1 as these approaches have been and as promising as the newer antiviral drugs may be, there are limitations to the present approaches.",

For the herpesviruses, the problem has been most apparent in the immunocompromised host treated with suboptimal drug doses. For the HIV antivirals, no one drug treatment has resulted in total viral suppression, and the rapidity of resistance development has varied from drug to drug. As a result of the lack of potent and sustained virus suppression, attention has now turned to combination therapy in the clinic. Thus, the availability of a more potent and diverse group of inhibitors for any one infectious agent should provide a richer armamentarium from which to choose the most effective combinations.",

One approach has been the modification of a known inhibitor or an enzyme substrate in a set of structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, to choose the inhibitor with the most attractive selectivity index (ratio of concentrations for antiviral efficacy compared to toxicity). This approach has produced the array of nucleoside and nucleotide inhibitors of HSV DNA polymerase and HIV reverse transcriptase, and the HIV protease substrate analog inhibitors. In the absence of a defined enzyme substrate, a traditional approach has employed a high-volume screen to evaluate thousands of compounds until a lead with some specificity of action can be identified and lead to the SAR refinement. As fruitful as these approaches have been, and as entrenched as these approaches are in the pharmaceutical modus operundi, they miss the great opportunity to design inhibitors against any of the gene targets provided by the virus. Herpes simplex virus has 71 open reading frames, for which the function of many of the resultant proteins is still poorly defined. Human immunodeficiency virus has nine open reading frames, yet only the reverse transcriptase and protease have been effectively addressed as antiviral targets by traditional approaches. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) more than 200 open reading frames, which should provide a rich hunting ground in the search for effective antivirals, if only we had the means to identify such inhibitors.",

That approach is the use of antisense nucleic acids complementary to the viral RNAs to block mRNA translation or genome replication. It can take the form of antisense oligonucleotides applied to the infected cell, antisense RNA expressed within the cell, or as ribozymes capable of complementary binding to the target RNA and target cleavage via the inherent catalytic activity. In this chapter we summarize the opportunity to use these approaches to identify novel antiviral drug targets and to develop novel antiviral strategies. These are the approaches embodied in the emerging field of genetic pharmacology: the development of drugs and gene therapy to control gene expression (Field and Goodchild, 1995; Yu et al., 1994; Temsamani and Agrawal, 1996) .

In principle, this suggests that if the sequence of a viral RNA (genome RNA or mRNA) is known, then one should be able to design a complementary oligonucleotide that will hybridize and inhibit its function as a replicating genome or mRNA (Fig. 1 ). This principle was first documented in the observations of Zamecnik and Stephenson, using a phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide to block Rous sarcoma virus replication Stephenson and Zamecnik, 1978) . But the road from principle and initial observations in 1978 to practical antiviral utility is a long one, on which we have learned to choose preferred viral RNA target sequences for maximum antisense impact, to FIGURE I Mechanisms of antisense oligonucleotide inhibition. Antisense oligonucleotides can bind to rarget RNA in cells, preventing protein production directly by translation arrest. In addition, DNA-RNA hybrids formed by oligonucleotide binding to RNA are recognized by RNase H, which digests the RNA portion of the hybrid, destroying the mRNA and freeing the oligonucleotide for binding to another mRNA molecule. chemically alter the antisense oligonucleotides to enhance stability and optimize activities in biological systems, and to recognize the array of biological actions of oligonucleotides that may contribute to antiviral activities and also to toxicities.",

As a result, introducing mismatch nucleotides to interfere with hybridization of the oligonucleotide with the RNA target, or substituting inappropriate sequence by ccscrambling\" the order of the nucleotides or reversing the predicted antisense 5'-to-3' orientation, should reduce the antiviral activity. Furthermore, the antisense mechanism predicts selective inhibition of gene expression. Suggested guidelines for acceptance of an oligonucleotide activity as fitting these criteria were presented by Stein and Krieg (1994) . Direct demonstration that an antisense oligonucleotide binds to the target RNA and violates its biological role within the cell has generally been difficult to obtain, although numerous indirect lines of evidence have suggested that this is so. For example, studies of antisense oligonucleotides against cytomegalovirus showed selective gene target inhibition resulting in a potent antiviral activity Pari et al., 1995) . In addition, recent studies of antisense mechanism have been fruitful and have demonstrated the direct antisense activities in situ (Politz et al., 1995; Giles et al., 1995a,b) . The details of these observations as they relate to antiviral activities are described in Section 111.",

For HIV, oligonucleotides targeted against a regulatory gene (rev), a viral enzyme (pol), and structural gene (gag) were compared in a single study (Kinchington et a!., 1992) . All oligonucleotides were reported to be equally active in an acute infection assay. The rev targeted oligonucleotide was the only oligonucleotide active against chronically infected cells, suggesting that this was the \"optimal\" gene for antisense targeting. However, other sequences against these genes were not evaluated and the inhibition required a 30 pM concentration, so it is not clear if the \"optimal\" sequences were actually chosen. For example, GEM 91, a 25mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide targeted at the gag gene, has been found to be active at submicromolar concentrations in acute infection assays and long-term model systems (Agrawal and Tang, 1992; Lisziewicz et al., 1993) . For HBV, RNA sequences have been identified that are essential for initiation of reverse transcription and packaging of viral RNA (Pollack and Ganem, 1994) . Oligonucleotides against these regions were reported to be potent inhibitors of HBV replication (Korba and Gerin, 1995) . For RNA viruses additional genetic targets may also be provided, since both genomic positive (picornaviruses), negative (influenza), and double-stranded (reoviruses), as well as individual transcripts, are available. For instance, we have targeted oligonucleotides to the genomic strand of respiratory syncytial virus to inhibit RNA replication, and it was previously shown that replication of both influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus was inhibited by oligonucleotides that were targeted to genomic RNA (Lemaitre et al., 1987; Leiter et al., 1990) .",

Functional groups, such as phosphate and hydroxyl residues on natural nucleic acids, can be modified as indicated in Fig. 3 . In general, those modifications that jeopardize the capacity of the oligonucleotide to participate in Watson-Crick base pairing are avoided, and most modifications have focused on the phosphodiester backbone and/or the sugar moiety. in loss of negative charge and greater hydrophobicity, but at the cost of loss of RNase H activation. Alternatively, by replacing a hydrogen at the 2' position on the deoxyribose with a hydroxymethyl group, the sugar becomes a modified ribose, which hybridizes more strongly with the complementary mRNA ribonucleotide and provides greater stability to the duplex, indicated by an elevated T,. These and other changes are demonstrated in Fig. 3 , and allow one to synthesize tailored oligonucleotides with a balance of characteristics of hybridization affinity, hydrophobicity, and the capacity to recruit RNase H-mediated cleavage of the target RNA. The importance of these oligonucleotide modifications in designing effective drugs is just now being evaluated, both in animal model systems and in the clinic. The first generation of widely used antisense oligonucleotides has been the PS compounds, and a body of data on biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism in animals and in humans is now available. These studies were summarized by Agrawal and Temsamani (1996) , Field and Goodchild (1995) , and Crooke and Bennett (1996) . A second generation of antisense oligonucleotides is now emerging that includes combinations of nucleotide modifications within the oligonucleotide. For instance, hybrid oligonucleotides may be defined as substituted at the 3' and/or 5' ends with 2'-OCH3 ribonucleosides, while maintaining the phosphorothioate backbone; chimeric oligonucleotides may be defined as substituted at the 3' and/or 5' ends with nonionic internucleotide linkages; and self-stabilized oligonucleotides may be defined as phophorothioates or phosphodiesters that have two domains-a single-stranded antisense sequence and a hairpin loop at the 3' end. The pharmacological characteristics of these and other modifications are summarized in papers by Agrawal and Temsamani (1996) and by . It is clear from the ongoing studies, that not only can one design an antisense inhibitor with potentially high selectivity in target inhibition, but one can now chemically modify that selected oligonucleotide to tailor the eventual drug for enhanced stability and perhaps tissuespecific uptake and metabolism . In addition, the first observation of oral uptake and tissue distribution of a hybrid oligonucleotide (Zhang et al., 1995a) indicates that the opportunity to develop oligonucleotide therapeutics with oral bioavailability may be at hand.",

            "text": "To date, most of the antiviral cell culture studies and all of the animal efficacy and clinical studies have employed PS oligonucleotides. More recently, Hybridon (Cambridge, MA) has introduced the first advanced oligonucleotide, GEM 132, a hybrid oligonucleotide for clinical study (see Section II1,B). These studies using PS oligonucleotides have generated useful informa-tion concerning antisense activities, but it is apparent that PS compounds may also have additional nonantisense modes of antiviral activity. This can be readily demonstrated for HSV, EBV, and HIV (Gao et af., 1990a; Yao et al., 1993; Wyatt et af., 1994; Ojwang et af., 1994a Ojwang et af., , 1995 Buckheit et af., 1994) . The nonantisense mechanisms include inhibition of virus binding and internalization Buckheit et af., 1994) and inhibition of virus-specific DNA polymerases (Yao et af., 1993; Gao et af., 1989 Gao et af., , 1990a . These effects are related to the general polyanionic nature of oligonucleotides, but are more pronounced for specific sequences. For example, oligonucleotides containing four consecutive G residues formed tetrameric structures that potently inhibited absorption of HIV or HSV (Buckheit et af., 1994) . Oligonucleotides containing only G and T residues inhibited absorption and integration of HIV (Ojwang et af., 1994b) ; this is believed to be due to higher order structure of the oligonucleotides. Certain oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs may also stimulate B cell proliferation and have immunostimulatory characteristics (Krieg et af., 1995) . The nonantisense effects may contribute significantly to antiviral effects by oligonucleotides, enhancing their activity in cell culture. Unfortunately, these effects might in certain cases mask antisense effects and make rational selection of gene targets and sequence targets more difficult. These anomalies are more fully discussed below in the context of individual antiviral studies.",

Cantor and Palmer evaluated the capacity of unmodified 15-mers to inhibit Tax translation from Tax message in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Cantor and Palmer, 1992) . Apparent sequence-specific inhibition of translation was observed with oligonucleotides directed against the 5' portion of the Tax RNA, including the AUG. One oligonucleotide, containing a four-G sequence and targeted at a 3' sequence, was actually stimulatory to translation by an undefined mechanism. This research was extended by Kitajima et al.. who demonstrated, both in murine cells in culture and in implanted Tax-producing fibrosarcoma cells, that a 20-mer modified by the phosphorothioate substitution at the terminal three nucleotides on the 3' end inhibited Tax protein expression (Kitajima et al., 1992a,b) . Greater than 10-fold inhibition of Tax expression in mature tumors occurred with an intraperitoneal injection of 40 pg/g. The similarly modified sense control oligonucleotide was ineffective. Curiously, in Tax-expressing cells the uptake of oligonucleotides was sevenfold higher than in non-Tax-expressing cells, and uptake appeared receptor mediated. The Tax protein causes transcriptional transactivation and is implicated in human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-mediated leukemogenesis, perhaps through activation and elevated expression of NF-KB, Kitajima also reported that antisense oligonucleotides, but not the complementary sense strand, targeted to NFkB mRNA translation start site inhibited Tax-transformed fibroblast growth and HTLV-I-transformed human lymphocyte growth. In mice, the antisense to NF-KB caused a rapid regression of the Tax-transformed tumors (Kitajima et al., 1992a) . The studies also suggested that although Tax is necessary to transform HTLV-I-infected cells, it is the maintenance of high levels of NF-KB that is important to sustaining the malignant phenotype.",

Zamecnik et al. (1986) and Goodchild et al.

GEM 91 was selected because of its potent antiviral effects, and was designed to bind to a well-conserved region of the viral genome of most clinical isolates. This illustrates one of the advantages of antiviral design through antisense-the potential to select among an array of molecular targets for inhibition . In these and other studies (Agrawal et al., 1989) , oligonucleotides were evaluated for their capacity to inhibit virus replication in long-term infected cell cultures, and selected antisense sequences were compared to unrelated or random sequence oligonucleotides. The results suggest that the selected antisense sequences have a considerable advantage of efficacy. Matsukura and colleagues also evaluated the inhibition of HIV replication by PS oligonucleotides, in this case targeted to the HIV rev RNA (Matsukura et al., 1989) . They reported sequence specificity of the antiviral effect (lack of activity of the sense, random, or homopolymeric sequences) and the expected effects on the HIV mRNA profile on treatment.",

The US trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalating study using GEM 91 intravenous continuous infusion for 2 weeks. In the French study, GEM 91 is given as 2-hr infusion every other day for 28 days. Study entrants must have a viral burden of 25,000 copies of viral RNA/ml of plasma. To date, safety has been demonstrated for doses up to 4.4 mg/kg by continuous infusion and 3 mg/kg by repeated intermittent, 2-hr infusion. From the initial pharmacokinetic phase I single dose studies using 35S-labeled GEM 91, plasma disappearance of the radioactivity associated with GEM 91 is the sum of two exponentials with mean half-lives of 0.18 and 26.71 hr. Both intact and degraded materials are found in the plasma. Elimination is mainly by urinary excretion of primarily lower molecular weight metabolites. Maximum tolerated doses have not yet been achieved (Zhang et al., 1995b) . Anazodo et al. (1995) demonstrated that a partially phosphorothioated 20-mer targeted to a well-conserved coding region of the gag gene inhibited both expression of mRNA for the viral precursor protein pSS and p55 protein and its cleavage product, p24, in COS cells stably transfected with plasmids containing the gag-pol region (Fig. 4 ). In this system, the use of lipofectin with the oligonucleotide enhanced the activity. Inverse sequence and double mismatch control oligonucleotides were less effective. At 1 pM the antisense 20-mer inhibited viral replication, as measured by reverse transcriptase levels, in a sequence-specific manner without inhibiting cell protein biosynthesis (large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase) or cell growth rate.",

Direct and potent ( K , values at 6-12 nM) inhibition of the reverse transcriptase (RT), RNase H, and primer extension functions has also been demonstrated for HIV (Hatta et al., 1993; Bordier et al., 1992; Austermann et al., 1992) and avian myeloblastosis virus (Hatta et al., 1993; Boiziau et al., 1992) . In addition to inhibition of RT, others have demonstrated the inhibition of HIV adsorption to cells (Zelphati et al., 1994) . Most recently an interesting phosphorothioate oligonucleotide sequence (T2G4T2) was identified that is a potent inhibitor of HIV viral envelope protein gp120 binding to the CD4 cell receptor. Specifically, T2G4T2 as well as other nonantisense oligonucleotide HIV inhibitors such as the phosphorothioate dC bind to the V3 loop of gp120 Stein et al., 1993) .

The immediate early genes are transcribed without the requirement for previous viral protein synthesis and include transactivators such as the a-4 gene product, ICP 4. The early genes include many required for viral DNA synthesis, including the DNA polymerase, and are not transcribed until immediate early gene translation has been initiated. Finally, the late gene transcription is initiated following viral DNA synthesis. These include the structural proteins such as the virion capsid proteins from genes UL 13 and UL 48 (Vmw 65). Vmw 65 (also known as VP 16 and a-TIF) has been identified as an essential structural element in the virion and also as a transactivator of immediate early gene expression (Roizman and Sears, 1996) . Although this is a simplistic description of the events during the replication cycle, it serves to illustrate that multiple antiviral targets are potentially available to truncate replication at various stages.",

Sequence specificity of the activity was suggested by the relative activities of two different 1 8-mers, although rigorous studies to demonstrate that the specificity was an antisense effect were not performed. Further inhibition studies using Vmw 65 as a target were performed by Kmetz et al. using the same 18-mer oligonucleotides, but as PS compounds (Kmetz et al., 1991) . The investigators found that a 25-pglml (4.3 p M ) concentration of oligonucleotide reduced replication of HSV-1 strain KOS by greater than 50%, and that the inhibition correlated well with the reduction of Vmw 65 protein. A random 18-mer served as control and had minimal inhibitory activity. Extension of the 18-mer by 5 nucleotides on the 3' end resulted in a more potent inhibitor.

For the earlier studies, the investigators used methyl phosphonate oligodeoxynucleotides, and reported a sequence specific inhibition of virus replication. A methyl phosphonate 12-mer targeted to the IE mRNA splice donor site was effective in reducing virus growth by 80% at 100 pM, whereas the same oligonucleotide in which the central two residues were inverted was inactive. The same methyl phosphonate reduced virus yield by localized treatment in the HSV-1 mouse ear infection (Kulka et al., 1993) . Although these studies suggest specificity of activity, the effective concentrations make them impractical as potential therapeutic drugs. More recently this group has found that by using a 12-mer methyl phosphonate targeted to the introdexon junction of the splice acceptor and by substituting 2'-OCH3U for dT, greater affinity for the RNA target and a fivefold reduction in 50% inhibitory concentration ICso (22 to 4 pM versus HSV-1 with no inhibition against HSV-2) was achieved. The sequence specificity of the oligonucleotides was indicated by the relative lack of activity of mismatched oligonucleotides (Kean et al. 1995) .",

Sequence specificity of the antiviral activity, as measured by inhibition of viral DNA replication, was established by comparison of the efficacy of UL 36 ANTI no effect on the expression of either IE 1 or IE 2 (Fig. 7) . UL 36 ANTI also reduced infectious virus yield by greater than 99% at 0.08 p M . Thus, a novel antiviral target was identified using the antisense oligonucleotide approach, resulting in a potent and selective antiviral agent. For future clinical evaluations, the UL 36 ANTI sequence has been investigated using chemical modifications described previously in this chapter. Preclinical evaluations are currently ongoing using a hybrid that is phosphorothioate at each nucleotide and that also contains 2'-OCH3 substitutions at two nucleosides on the 5' end and at four nucleosides on the 3' end. This compound has been identified as GEM 132 (Fig. 8) and combines the potency embodied in the UL 36 ANTI oligonucleotide sequence with the enhanced stability of a hybrid, providing the potential for systemic and intravitreal use. Its initial entry into clinical studies as a systemic therapy occurred in August 1996. Aphase I/II study to assess GEM 132 for intravitreal treatment of HCMV retinitis has been approved and studies are underway.",

The oligonucleotides were targeted against the coding region just 3' of the AUG. Prolonged treatment of Raji cells, which carry 60 EBV episomes per cell, with 40 pM unmodified antisense oligonucleotide was reported to result in a progressive reduction of EBNA 1 proteins determined by Western blots and in EBV copy number determined by Southern blots. Similar treatment with the sense oligonucleotide control was reported to be ineffective. Roth et al. (1994) also used unmodified oligonucleotides (40 p M ) complementary to sequences in the EBNA 1 RNA and observed inhibition of EBNA 1 translation and inhibition of cell proliferation, with no effect on proliferation of EBV-negative cell growth. When PS oligonucleotides were used by Pagano in dose-response evaluations of growth inhibition of EBV-transformed cord blood B cells, control sense and scrambled sequences were reported to be partially effective as inhibitors of cell proliferation, while antisense oligonucleotides were reported to suppress growth totally at 20 pM, and was partially effective at 5 pM (Pagano et al., 1992) . Thus, as demonstrated in other virus infections, PS oligonucleotides may have a nonspecific inhibitory effect, and indeed this has been shown in the studies by Yao et al. (1993) . They described potent inhibition (ECgo 0.5 p M ) of EBV yield from H1 cells, a chronically infected high-producer cell line, using PS 28-mer without sequence specificity for any EBV target. The mechanism of inhibition may be the result of blocking DNA synthesis, as was also described previously for the anti-HSV nonspecific oligonucleotide efficacy.",

The negative-stranded RNA genome of influenza A and B viruses contains eight segments, and acts as a template for viral mRNA synthesis as well as synthesis of the antigenomic (positive-stranded) RNA intermediate (Lamb and Webster, 1996) . The negative-stranded genome is packaged into virions along with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Viral replication is a complex process; viral mRNA synthesis and replication occurs in the nucleus of infected cells. mRNA synthesis initiates with host cell-derived primers containing 5'methylated capped RNA fragments from cellular RNA polymerase I1 transcripts. Four viral proteins are required for mRNA synthesis: NP, which is the major structural protein of the nucleocapsid, and the PB1, PB2, and PA proteins, which are polymerase proteins. Each of these proteins is encoded by a separate segment of the viral genome (Lamb and Webster, 1996) , and each is an attractive target for antiviral inhibition. Current antiviral therapies against influenza include amantidine and rimantidine, which act by blocking the ion channel formed by the M2 protein. This ion channel is pH activated and is required for uncoating of the viral nucleocapsid after virus infection. Amantidine and rimantidine are partially effective, especially when given as a prophylactic drug, but resistant virus variants can readily arise (Belshe et a/., 1988) . More recently, specific inhibitors of the viral neuraminidase activity (required for virus binding to cells) have been designed. Although this approach appears promising, additional therapies are required. Annual immunization has also been effective for high-risk populations; however, long-term immunization has not been possible due to antigenic variation from epidemic season to season.",

Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides targeted against the viral RNA or mRNA of the PB1 gene inhibited the replication of influenza A and influenza C viruses (Leiter et al., 1990) . For influenza C virus, a PS oligonucleotide targeted against the viral RNA of the PB1 gene inhibited plaque formation by >90% at 20 pM and caused a 106-fold reduction in infectious virus at 80 pM. A control oligonucleotide, containing one mismatch, was much less active, inhibiting plaque formation by about 50% at 20 pM. Oligonucleotides containing three mismatches or lacking influenza sequence did not inhibit plaque formation at 20 pM. Although this sequence-specific effect was observed, the active oligonucleotide contained a G quartet and mismatches eliminated this motif. It is not known whether the G quartet contributes to additional nonantisense mechanisms. Another study employed phosphodiester oligonucleotides modified at the 5' end with a hydrophobic group, n-undecanol (Kabanov et al., 1990) . A modified 10-mer targeted at the polymerase I11 gene was reported to inhibit influenza plaque formation at >10 pM, whereas an unmodified 10-mer and a modified nonsense 10mer were ineffective. The mechanism of inhibition, although apparently sequence specific, was not elaborated further. This is important since in addition to potential antisense inhibition, oligonucleotides have also been used as inhibitors of influenza virus RNA polymerase in vitro (Chung et al., 1994) . Short (<9-mer) oligonucleotides containing 5' cap structures (m7pppGm) bind in vitro to viral polymerase with high affinity and inhibit cap-dependent transcription. The antiviral effect of these oligonucleotides was not measured.",

This sequence is repeated at both ends of the pregenomic RNA and is recognized by viral proteins to package the viral RNA into nucleocapsids.

A series of oligonucleotides against HBV were evaluated using a hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line stably transfected with HBV DNA (Hep2.2.15; Korba and Gerin, 1995) . Oligonucleotides were reported to inhibit HBV virion production in a sequence-specific fashion. For oligonucleotides targeted against transcripts encoding structural proteins (S gene and C gene), HBV virion inhibition reportedly correlated well with inhibition of protein production. Antigen inhibition was also reported to be sequence specific; for example, oligonucleotides targeted against the S gene inhibited only HBsAg production, and had no effect on HBeAg or HBcAg levels. Interestingly, oligonucleotides targeted against the encapsidation sequence were reported to be among the most potent inhibitors identified in these experiments. These oligonucleotides inhibited virion production and intracellular HBV DNA replication, which is consistent with the requirement of this region in packaging viral RNA and viral DNA replication.

Lane 1 is sample from an untreated control duck (Offensperger et al., 1993 (Offensperger et al., ). 1996 . Transgenic mice expressing HBx developed liver lesions at the age of 2 months and liver tumors after 12 months. According to the authors, when treated with PS oligonucleotides targeted at the HBx translation start site intraperitoneally for 8 weeks, HBx production was inhibited as measured by RNA and protein production. In addition, hepatic lesions were reduced. The inhibition was reported to be sequence specific, in that a sense control did not inhibit; also, an oligonucleotide targeted within the HBx coding region was inactive. Subject to future positive studies, HBx therefore, appears potentially to be a useful target in HBV. Treatment of liver disease may be enhanced by targeting oligonucleotides to hepatocytes, the host cells for hepatitis virus replication. In two studies, oligonucleotides conjugated to asialoorosmucoid were reported to be taken up by cells containing the asialoglycoprotein receptor (Wu and Wu, 1992; Bunnell et al., 1992) . The conjugates reportedly attained -5to 10-fold greater cell association than did the unconjugated oligonucleotide, and this increase in uptake depended on the presence of the asialoglycoprotein receptor. In both studies, the reported increase in uptake resulted in antisense inhibition of the target gene. Antisense oligonucleotide complexes specifically decreased the production of HBV antigen in the medium of Hep2.2.15 cells by 80-90%; random oligonucleotide had no effect on virus production. In this report, uncomplexed antisense oligonucleotide reduced HBV antigen production by only 30-40%. This is in contrast to the observations of Korba and Gerin, who described uncomplexed phosphorothioates as effective inhibitors of HBV replication (Korba and Gerin, 1995) . The differences in these results may be due to the oligonucleotide sequences used by the investigators. These results, especially the in vivo studies on duck hepatitis virus, show that antisense oligonucleotides can provide effective therapy against hepatitis B infection. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides readily attain high concentrations in the liver Agrawal and Temsamani, 1996) , and the opportunity to target hepatocytes with the antisense oligonucleotide may provide a unique advantage for therapy.",

One compound, ISIS 2105, has been targeted at the HPV E2 mRNA translation initiation region of HPV-6 and HPV-11 (Cowsert et al., 1993) . They reported that cell culture studies using bovine papillomavirus (BPV) as a model system showed that oligonucleotides targeted at E2 could inhibit both E2-dependent transactivation in a transient assay and BPV-induced transformed cell focus formation, suggesting that the E2 gene is an appropriate target for antiviral therapy. Because HPV does not replicate in cell culture, further studies used a second model system in which E2dependent transactivation of a reporter gene (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) was measured. ISIS 2105 was reported to inhibit reporter expression, with an ECSo of approximately 5 pM (Fig. 12) . The inhibition was said to be sequence specific in that a control oligonucleotide targeted against the BPV E2 translation start site reportedly did not inhibit at concentrations up to 10 pM. These studies led to Phase I and I1 clinical trials for treatment of genital warts with ISIS 2105; however, these trials were discontinued by the sponsor, ISIS Pharmaceuticals (Carlsbad, CA).",

In early experiments, plasmids expressing HPV antisense RNA against HPV18 E6 and/or E7 altered growth characteristics of HeLa cells (Steele et al., 1992) . Antisense expression was regulated by the inducible mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter; induction resulted in a slowing of the growth rate, decrease in growth in soft agar, and an increase in serum requirement. Vero cells, which do not contain HPV sequences, were not effected by transfection with the antisense plasmids. Also, plasmids expressing the sense constructs of E6 and E7 did not change growth characteristics of HeLa cells. All these characteristics suggested that expressed antisense RNA caused a decrease in E6 and/or E7 expression and an alteration of the transformed phenotype of the HeLa cells.",

Interestingly, this report also suggested that E7 expression was also inhibited by an E6-specific antisense oligonucleotide, possibly due to the inhibition of the bicistronic E6-E7 transcript. The antisense oligonucleotides also were reported to inhibit tumor growth by SiHa cells in nude mice. In addition, a reported decrease in E7 expression was measured in the tumor, with no effect on a control gene (actin).

Antisense phosphodiester oligonucleotides (13-mers), targeted at the 5' untranslated region and the translation start site of EMCV, inhibited cell-free translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Sankar et al., 1989) . Specificity was demonstrated by showing that an oligonucleotide containing a single mismatch did not inhibit translation. The importance of the 5' untranslated region was confirmed; oligonucleotides targeted at the coding region or the 3' end of the genome did not inhibit translation. Although viral replication assays were not performed, the results in the cell-free translation system suggest that inhibition of internal ribosomal entry by oligonucleotides provides a novel target for virus inhibition. Antisense oligonucleotides inhibited replication of FMDV (GutiCrrez et al., 1993) . High concentrations (125-250 p M ) of phosphodiester oligonucleotides were microinjected into uninfected cells, which were then infected with FMDV. A modest reduction (35-50%) in the percentage of cells expressing FMDV antigen was detected 5 hr after infection. Sequence specificity was observed, since a scrambled control oligonucleotide was ineffective. Studies following the fate of fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide indicated localization in the nucleus after microinjection; high concentrations apparently saturated this transport process, and oligonucleotide was then detectable in the cytoplasm, the site of viral replication. Phosphorothioate versions of the same oligonucleotide sequences inhibited infectious virus yield by about 50% when used at high concentrations (50-100 pM). Again, the effect appeared to be sequence specific since the scrambled control was ineffective. However, the modest effects seen in this study using high oligonucleotide concentrations suggest that the utility of antisense oligonucleotides against FMDV is probably quite limited.",

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a well-studied member of the rhabdovirus family, and causes flulike symptoms in infected humans. Vesicular stomatitis virus is an enveloped virus containing five proteins and a negative-stranded genome. Five individual messenger RNAs are transcribed from the genome. Novel modifications of oligonucleotides have been evaluated as anti-VSV agents. Psoralen-modified methyl phosphonate oligonucleotides were reported to bind specifically to VSV mRNAs ilz vitro . Specific cross-linking occurred for 16-mer oligonucleotides targeted to the N or M mRNAs. A shorter (12-mer) oligonucleotide designed to bind specifically to M mRNA was also reported to bind to N mRNA. The oligonucleotide was partially complementary (9 of 12 residues) to N mRNA; and N mRNA was the predominant RNA species in the mixture. The high degree of homology of different mRNAs in VSV makes specific oligonucleotide targeting more difficult. However, the ability to target more than one RNA with the same oligonucleotide could potentially improve potency of an antiviral compound. Antiviral activity of these psoralen-modified oligonucleotides was not reported.",

Von Knebel Doeberitz and Gissmann demonstrated that expression of anti-sense RNA following transfection into HPV-transformed cells reduced the number of surviving cells capable of colony formation (von Knebel Doeberitz and Gissmann, 1987) .

But not all antisense RNA studies have resulted in virus inhibition, or in readily interpretable results. Leiter et al. demonstrated that even with successful inhibition of influenza replication in cells expressing virus-specific RNA but not the vector, the inhibition probably resulted from the induction of interferon following the formation of double-stranded RNAs hybridized from the sense and antisense strands (Leiter et al., 1989) . Double-stranded RNA has been repeatedly confirmed as a potent inducer of interferon a, and is a primary mechanism by which interferon is induced during virus infections (Marcus, 1994) . In most studies the induction of interferons has not been checked, leaving suspect the direct role of the antisense mechanism in the antiviral activity resulting from vector-expressed antisense RNA; thus further emphasizes the need for extensive controls in such studies. For HIV, several approaches ( Fig. 13) have been taken to inhibit replication by RNA expression . Transfection of cells to transcribe antisense RNA to the transactivation response (TAR) element (Chuah et al., 1994) , the gag region (Sczakiel and Pawlita, 1991) , the tat and rev regions (Junker et al., 1994; Sczakiel et al., 1992) , and the 5' leader region of HIV (Sun et af., 1995a) conferred various degrees of protection to HIV challenge infection in cells in culture. An additional nonantisense approach has been the overexpression of TAR or the Rev response element (RRE) as decoys. This provides a means to inactivate the Tat and Rev proteins by alternate binding to the antiviral decoy. This approach has had some success as demonstrated by Bevec et af. (1994) and by Lori et af. (1994) . In a single vector, Chang et af. combined the use of a TAR decoy and vector-expressed antisense RNA to the Tat mRNA both to block the activity of the Tat protein and block its translation . Compared to the vector controls, the combined decoy and antisense approach inhibited 94 to 98% of the Tat activity. A combination of RNA decoy and antisense RNA was taken a step further by the construction of a vector that expresses both the polymeric TAR decoy and the antisense to tat (referred to as avenue for ex vivo gene therapy to provide a competent and expanding pool of CD4' cells (Lisziewicz et al., 1995) .",

This combination should provide a potent and selective antiviral agent, and expressed ribozymes are undergoing evaluation and refinement in many laboratories. Sarver et al. first demonstrated in 1990 the use of an expressed hammerhead ribozyme targeted to the gag sequence of HIV to increase the resistance of HeLa CD4+ cells to HIV infection (Sarver et al., 1990) . Since then numerous publications using expressed hammerhead or hairpin ribozymes have appeared and the first clinical trials in AIDS patients should soon be at hand (Leavitt et al., 1996) . For a review of the antiviral ribozyme literature see Kijima et al. (1995) . However, for the purpose of this chapter we highlight only certain key studies. Wong-Staal and colleagues have concentrated on developing potently active hairpin ribozymes that can inhibit HIV replication in peripheral blood lymphocytes and mononuclear cells derived from CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (Leavitt et al., 1994; Yamada et al., 1994a,b; Yu et al., 1995) . They have targeted the ribozymes at either the 5' leader sequence of HIV-1 or a conserved region of the HIV-1 pol gene, and expressed it from a retroviral vector. Hammerhead ribozymes have been utilized by numerous investigators (Ho-mann et al., 1993; Crisell et al., 1993; Sun et al., 1995b; Lo et al., 1992) to target the tat gene or the LTWgag region. Both specificity and the requirement of the catalytic activity to obtain optimal anti-HIV activity suggest that the ribozymes are functioning in a catalytic manner, and not merely by an antisense mechanism of action.",

Both unmodified and PS 25-mer oligonucleotides complementary to the translation initiation codons inhibited the production of Zebra (as determined by Western blots) and replication of virus [shown by lack of production of the replicative linear DNA, viral early antigen (EA-D), and virus capsid antigen (VCA)]. Control sense, reverse sequence, and random oligonucleotides were less effective, and at the effective concentrations of antisense oligonucleotide no inhibition FIGURE 9 Immunoblot analysis of Zebra induction in antisense oligonucleotide-treated Akata cells. Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the translation start site of Zebra inhibited Zebra production; a random mix of 20-mer oligonucleotides was much less potent. Inhibition was quantitated relative to induced Akata cells induced for EBV expression by stimulation with anti-IgG and normalized to a 72-kDa protein (see arrowhead). Phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (A) and phosphodiester oligonucleotides (B) both inhibited Zebra induction. Reprinted from Antiviral Res. 29, Daibata, M., Enzinger, E. M., Monroe, J.
