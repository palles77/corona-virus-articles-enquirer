Adenoviruses were not detected during the first quarter of the year, but from April onwards they were found in a small percentage of cases, with the highest percentage (28%) occurring in October. The April figure of'28% is misleading since five of the seven cases recorded that month were from a welldefined ward outbreak, which was described in detail elsewhere 14 As the frequency of all other pathogens, including bacteria, was insignificantly small, no analysis was attempted. There were no deaths during this study, nor is there any evidence of any patient being admitted with a second episode of rotavirus enteritis, although twelve of the patients in this study had a history of more than one episode of acute enteritis; there is only one reported case of a patient having a second episode of rotavirus enteritis 13 There is evidence that seven children were infected by rotavirus whilst they were in hospital; five of these were patients in a long-stay children's orthopaedic ward in which an outbreak occurred.14 Discussion These results confirm the importance of rotaviruses as a major cause of gastroenteritis in young children, especially in those aged between 6 months and 3 years. Since babies under 6 months are obviously susceptible to rotaviruses, it is surprising that infecton should be less common in them than in the 6month to 3-year age-group. This may be due either to reduced exposure to rotaviruses because their main contact is with their parents, who are unlikely to be excreting rotaviruses, or to the apparent number of cases of enteritis in the group being increased by the inclusion of those with diarrhoea of non-infectious origin-e.g., \" feeding problems \".

It is not surprising, therefore, that our study revealed a considerable number of such strains. Conversely, there were some strains which were not detected by E.M. yet grew with ease in cell-culture. Those strains which did not grow in cell-culture may have been neutralised by the immune response of the gut, but as E.M. revealed neither virus-antibody complexes nor immunoglobulin-coated virions there is no evidence to support this hypothesis. Since these adenoviruses were often present in great numbers in the faeces, we feel sure that there must have been replication in the gut. Because we were unable to compare the adenovirus-positive group with matched controls we cannot be sure that the presence of the virus was connected with the patient's condition.

In such cases it is often possible to demonstrate a different pathogen in each episode. The second pathogen is often acquired in hospital. There is no evidence to suggest latent infection by rotaviruses; thus their presence indicates infection during the previous week or so. Chronic carriage of enteropathic bacteria is well known. It seems possible, however, that both infections could be contracted simultaneously by the ingestion of faeces or food contaminated with faeces. Since no effort was made to eliminate patients excreting enteropathic bacteria from our studies, the low frequency of salmonellse, shigellae, and enteropathic E. coli serotypes suggests that bacteria were responsible for only a small proportion of cases of gastroenteritis in young children in this part of the U.K. during the period of this survey.",

Another possible explanation for the apparent absence of rotavirus infection in children of more than 6-7 years is that infections in non-immune older children are subclinical. Subclinical infections occur with the virus of enzootic diarrhoea of infant mice (E.D.I.M.), which is now known to be a rotavirus.12.17 E.D.I.M. causes diarrhoea in suckling mice up to 13 days old, whereas in older mice infection is subclinicap8",
