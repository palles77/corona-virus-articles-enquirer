A recombinationally-active subgenomic promoter (sgp) has been mapped in Brome mosaic bromovirus (BMV) RNA3 (Wierzchoslawski et al., 2004. J. Virol.78, 8552-8864) and mRNA-like 5\u2032 sgRNA3a was characterized (Wierzchoslawski et al., 2006. J. Virol. 80, 12357-12366). In this paper we describe sgRNA3a-mediated recombination in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. BMV replicase-directed co-copying of (\u2212) RNA3 with wt sgRNA3a generated RNA3 recombinants in vitro, but it failed to when 3\u2032-truncated sgRNA3a was substituted, demonstrating a role for the 3\u2032 polyA tail. Barley protoplast co-transfections revealed that (i) wt sgRNA3a recombines at the 3\u2032 and the internal sites; (ii) 3\u2032-truncated sgRNA3as recombine more upstream; and (iii) 5\u2032-truncated sgRNA3 recombine at a low rate. In planta co-inoculations confirmed the RNA3-sgRNA3a crossovers. In summary, the non-replicating sgRNA3a recombines with replicating RNA3, most likely via primer extension and/or internal template switching.",

Similarly, recombinationally-active sgps have been predicted in other RNA viruses (Koev et al., 1999; Miller and Koev, 2000; Rohayem et al., 2005) . Yet an additional function of the intergenic region in BMV RNA3 is in the formation of 5\u2032 sgRNA3a by premature termination . SgRNA3a covers the 5\u2032 part of RNA3 including the 3a ORF and a short 3\u2032 oligo (A) tail, so to a certain extent it resembles a cellular mRNA.

The full-length RNA3 products with JS-21 (lane 5) were cut out from the gel, purified, subjected to RT-PCR amplification, and the cDNA material was cloned (see Materials and methods). Based on a restriction enzyme analysis of sixty clones, five clones (8%) acquired marker restriction sites from JS-21 sgRNA3a ( Table 2 ). All five clones carried both restriction markers, indicating that the entire JS-21 sequence recombined. In contrast, no recombinant clones were identified for JS-14 RNA, indicating that the shorter polyA tail did not support recombination. Also, JS-0 sgRNA3a did not generate recombinants ( Table 2 ), indicating that the polyA tail alone and/or the 12 upstream bases were important. Finally, RT-PCR of the full-length RNA copying products (cut from the gel, lanes 1 or 2, Fig. 2 ) did not generate marker-bearing cDNA recombinants, reflecting the lack of contaminating sgRNA3a molecules.

The insert sequences were released by HindIII/EcoRI digestion and separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel.

Northern blot analysis showing the accumulation in protoplasts of either (+) or (\u2212) strands (left and right panels, respectively) of BMV RNAs. Total protoplast RNA was separated in a 1.2% denaturing agarose gel, blotted, and probed with a 3\u2032-specific RNA probe detecting either (+) or (\u2212) strands (see Materials and methods). Lanes 1 and 6, virion BMV RNA used as size standards; lanes 2 and 7, negative controls from mock inoculated protoplasts; lanes 3 and 8, protoplasts transfected with equimolar amounts of BMV RNAs 1 and 2 and wt RNA3; lanes 4 and 9, protoplasts transfected with BMV RNAs 1 and 2 and (A \u2192 U) RNA3; lanes 5 and 10, protoplasts transfected with BMV RNAs 1 and 2, (A \u2192 U) RNA3, and sgRNA3a. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bands (after staining with ethidium bromide) are shown below. The position corresponding to the (\u2212) RNA4 band is marked with a single asterisk on the right panel, whereas the migration position of degradation products (likely because minus strands are not encapsidated and thus less protected) is marked with two asterisks. recombinants (Fig. 5) . Thus, nearly half of the crossovers occurred near the JS(H)-21 3\u2032 end, whereas the others took place more upstream. The 3\u2032-side crosses (RNA sequence corresponding to the PstI marker) dropped to 27% for JS(H)-0, demonstrating that the lack of the 3\u2032 polyA tail favored the upstream sites. This upstream preference was even higher for the 5\u2032-780, 5\u2032-580, and 5\u2032-380 RNAs, which generated only BamHI-carrying recombinants. Overall, these data show the existence of at least two recombination regions, one at the 3\u2032 terminus and an additional upstream site possibly between nts 550 and 780. The upstream site can be folded into strong stem-loop structures (data not shown), and indeed Choi and Rao (2003) have shown that hairpins between nts 601 and 817 act as the RNA3 packaging signal dubbed PE. The 5\u2032-380 and 5\u2032-150 RNAs do not fold into comparable structures. We hypothesize that two independent mechanisms operate during RNA3-sgRNA3a recombination: polyA-mediated 3\u2032-terminal primer extension and PE-mediated strand switching (see Discussion).",

Only one clone carried the downstream (PstI) marker (experiment 5, Table 2 ). This demonstrates that the repair of the 3a ORF was by RNA recombination rather than due to complementation and suggests 3\u2032 extension as the main mechanism of recombination (see Discussion).

Because the polyA tail (or the U-track in the (\u2212) strand) is likely unpaired (assuming it is not PABP-bound), it might serve as a preferred re-initiation/recombination site. This is supported not only by our observation of RdRp initiation at the polyA tail ( Fig. 4) but also by similar observations made in BMV (Karran and Hudak, 2008; Choi et al., 2004) , Bamboo mosaic potexvirus (Cheng et al., 2002; Tsai et al., 1999) , picornaviruses (Barton et al., 2001; Herold and Andino, 2001; Svitkin et al., 2008) , Sindbis virus (Hill et al., 1997) , and Encephalomyocarditis virus (Cui et al., 1993) . Some (+) sense RNA viruses use the poly(A) tail for priming of (\u2212) strand RNA synthesis e.g., Coxsackie B virus (Melchers et al., 1997) and Bamboo mosaic potexvirus (Cheng et al., 2002) or to enhance template recruitment (Herold and Andino, 2001; Wang et al., 2000; Leonard et al., 2004) . Also, in Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV), which is closely related to BMV, the RNA3 component lacks the polyA tract and it does not result in formation of homologous recombinants (de Wispelaere et al., 2005) . Yet another effect might be due to the close proximity of the sgRNA4 transcription site, which may enhance RdRp recruitment (Sztuba-Soli\u0144ska and Bujarski, 2008) .",

We hypothesize that this reflects limited access to the replicating (\u2212) strands. Indeed, the use of either mut-RNA3 (Choi et al., 2004 and Fig. 6A ) or neg-RNA3 increased the recombination frequency to 42% or 25%, respectively. The subsequent use of an sgRNA3a construct without a polyA tail (JS(H)-0) decreased the frequency to 23% and shifted the crossovers to upstream positions, verifying the role of the polyA tail (Fig. 5) . For Infectious Bronchitis coronavirus or Equine rhinovirus, the cross sites clustered at the exposed polyA tails (Jonassen et al., 1998) . Suzuki et al. (2003) and Galli et al. (2003) have shown that secondary structures play a role in cross-site selection (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2009 ). Our MFOLDbased modeling (data not shown) revealed exposure of the unpaired 3\u2032 polyA tail within sgRNA3a. Also, for shorter sgRNA3a fragments (Fig. 5) , some correlation could be drawn between the AU content at their 3\u2032 ends and their recombination frequency (not shown). Previously, the AU content was proposed to facilitate the detachment of the 3\u2032 end from the donor template Nagy and Bujarski, 1996) . Here, the highest AU pair content (64%) was calculated for the JS(H)-21 and 5\u2032-780 constructs, and these also yielded the highest proportions of recombinants, 42% and 35%, respectively. The 5\u2032-580 fragment had the lowest number of AU pairs (49%), and the crossover frequency was reduced to 15%.",

The apparent deficiency of the central HindIII marker (also observed for JS(H)-0) suggests additional crosses within this region. Also, a noticeable drop in the recombination activity between the 5\u2032-780 and 5\u2032-580 RNAs (from 35% to 15%) suggests an additional recombination site between nts 550 and 780. This region has been mapped as the position-dependent RNA3 packaging element PE (nts 601-817), holding strong affinity to the multimeric CP complexes (Choi and Rao, 2003) . Following the initial binding of CP subunits to the 3\u2032 tRNA-like structure, a cis interaction with PE forms a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex consisting of CP and RNA3 that then interacts in trans with sgRNA4 to facilitate the co-packaging of both RNAs into virions (Annamalai and Rao, 2006) . Thus, it is possible that CP binding at the PE element might bridge over the recombining RNA substrates and/or might create a roadblock for progressing RdRp, thereby facilitating template switching. Clearly, RNA packaging is not the only function of BMV CP (Yi et al., 2009a, b) . CP co-purifies with BMV replicase (Bujarski et al., 1982) , and it binds at several sites to BMV RNAs, including the B-box, the PE, and the 3\u2032 tRNA-like structure (Yi et al., 2009a, b; Choi and Rao, 2003) .",

This system utilized two co-replicating RNA3 variants that crossed within the restriction marker sites. In our current paper we describe recombination in C. quinoa between a replicating RNA3 construct (PB3-33del) that carries a disabled movement protein ORF and a non-replicable sgRNA3a carrying two marker sites (JS-21). The incorporation of JS-21 sequences into the progeny RNA3 is evident by the two sgRNA3a markers being found in the vast majority of the RNA3 recombinants (Table 2 , lower panel). The appearance of sgRNA3a-RNA3 crosses reflects inefficient complementation between sgRNA3a and PB3-33del. Indeed, the number of local lesions was about twenty-fold smaller with mutated RNAs as compared with the same amount of wt BMV RNA transcripts (not shown). Furthermore, all local lesions accumulated the recombinants. This apparent lack of complementation has been observed not only with this and previous BMV four-component systems (this work and Bruyere et al., 2000, respectively) , but also after co-inoculation of cowpeas with deletions in both movement and coat protein genes of Cowpea chlorotic mottle bromovirus (Allison et al., 1990) . However, a low-level of complementation cannot be excluded, as it might help at the initial stages of local lesion formation. In fact, sgRNA3a was found to support efficient translation of movement protein . The lack of replication of sgRNA3a likely imposes critical constraints on the four-component system, favoring the accumulation of RNA3 recombinants.",

The fact that all restriction markers were found in the majority of in planta recombinants emphasizes the 3\u2032 primer extension mechanism. It is possible that the location of the deletion in the PB3-33del input RNA (nts 401-499) affected the folding of the nearby PE element, and consequently disabled the role of CP binding during internal template switching, as postulated above. The lack of recombination activity with JS-0 further points to primer extension via the 3\u2032 polyA tail. The polyA tail may interact more easily with the exposed intercistronic region on the (\u2212) RNA3 template than with other regions along the RNA3 sequence. However, one may speculate that at least some of the observed effects were due to higher stability of the polyA-carrying JS-21 than of JS-0 RNAs. Increased stability has been reported for the polyadenylated RNAs of Tobacco mosaic virus (Gallie and Kobayashi, 1994) , potexviruses (Guilford et al., 1991; Tsai et al., 1999) , herpesviruses (Conrad et al., 2007) , and for eukaryotic mRNAs (Grosset et al., 2000; Anderson, 2005) .

Our data suggest that this process can occur either by 3\u2032 primer extension or by internal replicase switching. The specific features that define potentially useful RNA substrates might be the presence of a 3\u2032 polyA tail, high AU content of the 3\u2032 ends, and the presence of target secondary structures. The strand switching mechanism might utilize protein binding sites (e.g., CP or RdRp) that may bridge over the recombining RNAs and/or serve as roadblocks during RNA replication. All these features enhance the generation of progeny mosaic RNAs, as previously suggested (Urbanowicz et al., 2005) . Crossover events have been mapped at highly structured 5\u2032-sides (Che et al., 2001; Gowda et al., 2003; and at oligo A regions (Jonassen et al., 1998) . The RNAs of other bromoviruses and togaviruses carry internal polyA tracts (Fujisaki et al., 2003; Iwahashi et al., 2005; Fauquet et al., 2005) , and sgRNA3a-like RNAs were observed in Broad bean mottle virus-and Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus-infected hosts (Dzianott and Bujarski, unpublished results) .

We show that recombination with non-replicating RNAs can rescue a functional RNA genome when plants are inoculated with defective viruses. For instance, this confirms previous findings that cellular RNAs were incorporated into some viral RNAs (Mayo and Jolly, 1991; Sano et al., 1992) . The observed crossovers demonstrate that such genome rescue is potentially significant in natural infections. Because plant RNA viruses can generally replicate in primarily inoculated cells, the recombinational repair of movement protein likely plays an important role in virus survival. Both the ability to compensate for high mutation rates and the possibility of in planta recombination between a not properly adapted virus and a co-infecting RNA may have potential roles during virus adaptation to new hosts, and they may also facilitate the divergence of new viral species. The results described here are likely relevant to other (+) stranded RNA viruses.",
