In Figure 2 , the extracted amounts of GA and glabridin increased as the dipping times was increased from 10 min to 90 min and no obvious increased after further prolong extraction time. Equivalent samples were then prepared by an ultrasonic method without dipping time. Figure 3 shows that the extracted amounts of GA and glabridin increased with an increase of ultrasonic time. However, comparing the results of the two methods, it was found that the amounts extracted via the ultrasonic method were lower, while more energy was required in the experiments.

Mixture of ethanol/water (30:70, v/v) and extraction time 60 min under 50\u00b0C is the optimum condition to extract GA and glabridin from licorice. The extracted amounts are 2.39 and 0.92 mg/g and recoveries are 89.7% and 72.5% respectively.",
