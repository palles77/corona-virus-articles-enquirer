At 1 and 2dpi, CHIKV RNA was extracted from the blood of individual mice and used for RT-PCR analysis. The relative fitness (RF) within a given competition was determined as a geometric mean of ratio between 210Q or 252Q and DM bands in the mouse blood, divided by the starting ratio of 210Q or 252Q and DM bands in the inoculum used for infection of mice.Supplementary Figure 9.
