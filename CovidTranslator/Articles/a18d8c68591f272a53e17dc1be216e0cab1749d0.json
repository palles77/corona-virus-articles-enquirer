Methods: Network centrality metrics were used to characterize hospital-acquired Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (HA-MERS) outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2016. Covariate-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the effect of individual level risk factors and network level metrics associated with increase in length of hospital stay and risk of deaths from MERS. Results: About 27% of MERS cases were hospital acquired during the study period. The median age of healthcare workers and hospitalized patients were 35 years and 63 years, respectively, Although HA-MERS were more connected, we found no significant difference in degree centrality metrics between HA-MERS and non-HA-MERS cases. Pre-existing medical conditions (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) = 2.43, 95% confidence interval: (CI) [1.11-5.33]) and hospitalized patients (aOR = 29.99, 95% CI [1.80-48.65]) were the strongest risk predictors of death from MERS. The risk of death associated with 1-day increased length of stay was significantly higher for patients with comorbidities. Conclusion: Our investigation also revealed that patients with an HA-MERS infection experienced a significantly longer hospital stay and were more likely to die from the disease. Healthcare worker should be reminded of their potential role as hubs for pathogens because of their proximity to and regular interaction with infected patients. On the other hand, this study has shown that while healthcare workers acted as epidemic attenuators, hospitalized patients played the role of an epidemic amplifier.",

The danger of infection is highest for groups of individuals living in close proximity. From the intermittent transmission that occurred in animal-to-human, many human-to-human cases of MERS have also been documented within family and healthcare facilities [1] [2] [3] . Transmission of MERS pathogen can form networks of infected individuals that were connected either directly or indirectly. One should expect in such environments the formation of large clusters of infections as observed during the outbreak in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) [4] and South Korea (SK) [5] . Cluster size of human-to-human transmissions of MERS has been shown to vary and a high variability and heterogeneity in the transmission potential have been underscored [6, 7] .",

The disease has now spread to over 27 countries with most index patients either residing or recently traveling to areas neighboring the Arabian Peninsula [9, 10] . Similarly, the vast majority of the total cases (82%) occurred in KSA [8] . The global mortality rate was highest (58%) at the beginning of the epidemics (September 2012-February 2013) and it dropped continuously to an absolute low of 23% during September 2015-February 2016. As of February 2018, these infections has led to 779 documented deaths (a mortality rate of 36%) [8] . People within the age-group 50-59 years are at the highest risk of being infected as primary cases and have the highest mortality rate [8] . Forty-five day survival rate was lowest in patients older than 65 years (44.86%) [11] . Also, healthcare workers (HCW) are regularly exposed to MERS due to their regular contacts with MERS patients and are at greater risk of being infected; however, they are less likely to die of the disease [10, [12] [13] [14] .",

The disease spread out across various cities in SK within two months, expanding from one to 17 hospitals and infecting a total of 186 people. Similarly, a major MERS outbreak was registered at a tertiary-care hospital in Riyadh in 2015 [4, 17, 21, 22] . The escalation of the Riyadh outbreak was linked to extended healthcare-related human-to-human transmissions [4, 17, 21, 22] . These outbreaks were attributed to few index cases and the level of their spreading depended on interactions between individuals. For example, 82 out of the 186 infected patients in SK were traced back to one index patient alone due to the overcrowded emergency room with patients, visitors and healthcare worker [23] .",

The data contains information on patient demographics, clinical outcome, whether the patient was a healthcare worker (HCW), comorbidity status of the patient, and place of exposure to known risk factors. We used the following approaches to estimate length of hospital stay (LOS): (1) we restricted our analysis to those patients who are still alive and those that died within 60 days for short-time risk of death analysis (2) LOS was calculated as the difference between the date of onset of disease (or date reported whenever date of onset was not available) and date of death/discharged.",

A network can be defined as a collection of nodes connected by edges where nodes and/or edges have attributes [28] . Each patient (node) was assigned a unique identification number and his/her contact history was tracked within 14 days of the onset of the disease. MERS patients who were in contact with other laboratory-confirmed MERS patients were identified and a list of each patient-contact pair (dyad) was prepared. A dyad is a linked pair of patients (nodes) in the network that is the fundamental unit for deriving network metrics. The outbreak network visualization and network analysis were conducted in UCINET 6.0 Version 1.00 [29] . The following centrality metrics were used to measure the structural importance of patients (nodes) in a network. \"Degree centrality\" was used to reveal the most active nodes in the network and how well a node is connected with its neighbours -a node degree is the number of edge incidents on a node; the \"betweenness centrality\" was used to measure how many pairs of nodes a node can be connected to through a shortest path while \"eigenvector centrality\" was used to measure the importance of a node depending on the importance of its neighbours [27, 29] .",

In this study, we have identified that, about 48% of MERS patients with known contact history can be linked to healthcare settings through person-to-person transmission and a large number of those infected were healthcare workers. The role of the patient's characteristics was explored with network analysis, since the propagation of the pathogen varies among patients, visitors and healthcare workers [17] . Some nodes may amplify the intensity of disease transmission while others might attenuate the spread [36] . Although most of the patients in this study had comorbidity, they did not significantly amplify the spread of the disease. On the contrary, hospitalized patients with comorbidity had a higher risk of spreading the disease. Older patients were more likely to have a hospital-acquired MERS infection than non-hospital-acquired MERS infections. Older people seem to have been statistically more exposed to the disease at healthcare facilities than at other places which might be the result of a combination of senior people been admitted to the hospital more frequently due to their advanced age and having less active social interactions than younger people. This is consistent with previous findings that the chances of dying from the MERS grew with increasing age beyond 25 years [10] . It also confirms the common assumption that the danger of infection is greater for senior patients and, therefore, special attention needs to be paid to them. The risk of death associated with increased length of stay was significantly higher for patients with comorbidities and hospitalacquired MERS infections. The impact of MERS infection together with another disease or condition was investigated earlier. Such a combination was much more likely to be fatal [10, 37] . This result is insofar important as it applies to a large portion of the population given the fact that many were affected by non-communicable diseases of affluence such as diabetes, obesity, heart diseases, etc. For instance, more than half of the population of Saudi Arabia with the age of at least 50 years has diabetes [38] .",

The length of hospital stay has been investigated from various perspectives both medical and economical [39] [40] [41] [42] . Our result is in accordance with Glance et al.

Health care workers are often in compliance with risk management approaches to reduce and control transmission of MERS by wearing protective gears and are aware of other hygienic measures, to reduce the dose of infectious agents preventing further spread of the disease. In the same vein, hospitalized patients played the role of an epidemic amplifier, i.e. they played more the role of transmitters. This complements an earlier publication showing that the vast majority of documented MERS patients had contacts with other patients in healthcare facilities and that nosocomial infections occurred more often in outbreak than non-outbreak cases [15, 16] .",

However, the reporting has been improved upon over the years with coordination between Saudi government agencies and WHO. The data sets were also assessed for accuracies with those reported by Flu Trackers, Saudi MOH and WHO. Secondly, the network analysis considered in this study was solely based on confirmed MERS cases with strict directionality; therefore, unconfirmed cases will be missed. Similarly, we restricted our analysis to those with known contact history to be able to differentiate the source of infection and construct the transmission network. In spite of these limitations, analysis based on network analysis offers very interesting findings on the distribu-tion of secondary cases caused by each primary case. Lastly, lack of information on hospitals prevented us from exploring the spread of MERS between hospitals.",

The outcomes of our research emphasize the importance of putting patients with communicable diseases, especially life-threatening diseases, immediately under quarantine and minimizing the access of healthcare workers to such patients. Such precautionary measures could be lifesaving, in particular for patients with comorbidities and/or of senior age who need to be observed closer during their entire hospital stay. Moreover, healthcare workers should be advised on their potential role as hubs for pathogens due to the nature of their occupation. Loose adherences to preventive and protective measures by the health care workers should be identified and immediately corrected in order to avoid the negative role they may play in transmitting the agent.",
