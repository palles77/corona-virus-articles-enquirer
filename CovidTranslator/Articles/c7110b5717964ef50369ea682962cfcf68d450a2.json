            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease complex is a major cause of illness in dairy calves. The diagnosis of active infection of the lower respiratory tract is challenging on daily basis in the absence of accurate clinical signs. Clinical scoring systems such as the Californian scoring system, are appealing but were developed without considering the imperfection of reference standard tests used for case definition. This study used a Bayesian latent class model to update Californian prediction rules. The results of clinical examination and ultrasound findings of 608 preweaned dairy calves were used. A model accounting for imperfect accuracy of thoracic ultrasound examination was used to obtain updated weights for the clinical signs included in the Californian scoring system. There were 20 points (95% Bayesian credible intervals: 11-29) for abnormal breathing pattern, 16 points (95% BCI: 4-29) for ear drop/head tilt, 16 points (95% BCI: 9-25) for cough, 10 points (95% BCI: 3-18) for the presence of nasal discharge, 7 points (95% BCI: \u22121 to 8) for rectal temperature \u226539.2\u00b0C, and \u22121 points (95% BCI: \u22129 to 8) for the presence of ocular discharge. The optimal cut-offs were determined using the misclassification cost-term term (MCT) approach with different possible scenarios of expected prevalence and different plausible ratio of false negative costs/false positive costs. The predicted probabilities of active infection of the lower respiratory tract were also obtained using posterior densities of the main logistic regression model. Depending on the context, cut-off varying from 9 to 16 can minimized the MCT. The optimal cut-off decreased when expected prevalence of disease and false negative/false positive ratio increased.",

            "text": "Various systemic clinical signs (fever, depression, anorexia) and respiratory signs (nasal discharge, tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, etc\u2026) characterize the classical BRD presentation (McGuirk, 2008) . Due to the variety of infectious agents involved in BRD, the clinical signs vary in terms of intensity and duration. The term of subclinical BRD can also be used for defining calves not detected as sick by clinical examination but presenting lung lesions (e.g. detected at slaughter or by ultrasound examination). The primary surveillance of BRD is generally performed by the farmers or their workers who observe calves daily (especially during the feeding period). However, this BRD detection strategy, based on human observation is most often considered as an art rather than a science (Portillo, 2014) . Pen riders detecting BRD in feedlot calves are good examples of this concept. It is difficult to \"teach\" how to be a good pen rider (Portillo, 2014) . For these reasons, using a simple and practical systematic approach is of interest to develop a common BRD definition and a structured examination process. Two of them have gained in popularity for dairy calves in North America (McGuirk, 2008; Love et al., 2014) . The first scoring system is based on 5 clinical signs assessment (rectal temperature, cough, nasal and ocular discharges, and ear position) which are categorized in 4 (0-3) different ordinal levels (McGuirk, 2008) . The accuracy of this clinical scoring system was recently assessed using a Bayesian latent class framework (Buczinski et al., 2015b) . The score sensitivity (Se) for detection of active BRD was 62.4% (95% Bayesian credible intervals (BCI): 47.9-75.8%) and specificity (Sp) was 74.1% (95% BCI: 64.9-82.8%). Recently, a second clinical scoring system was developed considering previous clinical signs included in Wisconsin score and trying to assess weight of each clinical signs based on logistic regression coefficients Love et al., 2014) . One of the advantages of this new clinical scoring system is that each clinical sign is assessed using a dichotomous way (normal vs. abnormal). The weight attributed for each selected clinical item was determined using a conditional logistic regression analysis. Two different BRD case definitions were used in this study. The calves with a positive nasopharyngeal PCR for viral pathogens (bovine respiratory syncytial virus, herpesvirus type 1, or bovine viral diarrhea virus) were defined as cases. The calves with a nasopharyngeal swab culture positive for an aerobic respiratory pathogen (Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Histophilus somni or Bibersteinia trehalosi) or Mycoplasma spp. were defined as cases if their Wisconsin score was \u22655. The rounded regression coefficients obtained from logistic regression models were used as prediction rule's weight for each retained clinical sign. Three different scoring systems were reported but the third presented model (BRD3 score) using a threshold \u22655 to define a case was selected for further use by the authors Love et al., 2014 Love et al., , 2016 . One of the limitations of the methodology presented for obtaining clinical signs \"weights\" was that the calves' BRD definition was determined partly using Wisconsin score results (80% of BRD cases and 71% of control cases were classified according to their Wisconsin score result). This implies that the same clinical signs for which the authors tried to define accuracy were also included in case definition. This \"testimation\" problem could potentially artificially inflate prediction weight due to collinearity between the test to assign BRD status (Wisconsin score) and the clinical signs assessed (same clinical signs than the Wisconsin score) as previously described (Steyerberg, 2008) . Attribution of weight for prediction rules and their validation is an important but challenging task in medical science (Toll et al., 2008; Collins et al., 2015) . This challenge is even more important in the absence of a gold standard to define the true disease status of each patient (Magder and Hughes, 1997; McInturff et al., 2004) . Bayesian latent class models have received a lot of attention in the recent years to study diagnostic tests in the absence of gold standard (Branscum et al., 2005; van Smeden et al., 2014) . The use of Bayesian methodology is also flexible and allows incorporation of classification error in the reported outcome from logistic regression modeling (McInturff et al., 2004) . It would therefore be of interest to assess the accuracy of the Californian scoring system considering the imperfection of thoracic ultrasonography.",

The sample size calculation for the number of herds to include in that previous study was based on an expected prevalence of 10% of lung consolidation with a 7.5% precision estimate. In participating herd, 6-12 preweaned female calves randomly selected from all preweaned calves were included in summer 2015 and winter 2016. A total of 608 calves from 39 herds were then recruited and the clinical signs used in the Californian scoring system were collected on these calves during farms visits. A systematic bilateral thoracic ultrasonography (TUS) was also performed in all enrolled calves by one experienced veterinarian (SB) and a recently graduated veterinarian who received a specific training on TUS. The agreement for finding lung consolidation using this training technique was previously reported with \u03ba values from 0.6 to 1.0 (moderate to perfect) in preweaned dairy calves (Buczinski et al., 2013) . The lung field caudal to the heart (right and left) and the cranial right lung field were screened as previously reported Ollivett and Buczinski, 2016) . The TUS examination was positive if consolidation (depth \u22651 cm) was diagnosed. The TUS was negative if consolidation was < 1 cm (Buczinski et al., 2015b) .",

In a high prevalence scenario (40% prevalence as in a clinical outbreak) or for r = 1:20, a very low score cut-off would be the optimal choice (eg treating all calves with one abnormal sign). For a low prevalence scenario and for r of 1:8 or less, a cut-off of 13 or 15 would minimize MCT. In average BRD prevalence situation (20%), a cut-off between 9 to 16 would minimize MCT depending on r values.

A simple clinical scoring rule appears as a promising tool for the farmers and their workers. However, it is crucial to establish an unbiased estimate of the accuracy of this scoring rule. This study considered the absence of gold standard for BRD definition in calves to assess clinical score accuracy. Rather than basing our approach on an hypothetical gold standard we used a reference standard test with imperfect accuracy (thoracic ultrasound). With our latent class modeling approach, we establish that the optimal cut-off to define a positive case varied from 9 to 16 in low to average BRD prevalence situations. However, in high prevalence situation (\u226540%) treating all calves with one abnormal clinical sign would be the most cost-effective strategy. Relaxing accuracy results from thoracic ultrasound with non-informative priors had a limited impact on our predicting regression coefficient scores, which reinforces the external validity of the present findings.",

First, it can be intuitive to look for the predicted probability of suffering from active lower respiratory tract infection for a calf with a specific clinical profile using the posterior probabilities from the main logistic regression model based on the 64 different clinical signs permutations. These predicted probabilities can be directly used by either veterinarians or farmers for assessing the risk of being sick based on our decision tree. Secondly, the clinical prediction rule using updated weights for each clinical item can also be used with some flexibility. Depending on the context (low vs. high expected prevalence of BRD, producer efficiency to detect calves), the cut-offs used for defining an affected animal could be modified considering the relative cost of misclassified calves. This scoring rule could also serve as a screening test before applying other more specific tests such as thoracic auscultation or determination of serum acute phase protein concentrations in calves with abnormal clinical signs profiles. Used for this purpose, the cut-off could be adjusted to be more sensitive since the false positive cases would be correctly classified by the second test.",

Due to this limitation, composite reference standard definition is frequently used. Association of multiple positive test (ex: increased rectal temperature, specific clinical signs, abnormal auscultation or ultrasound findings) for assessing new test accuracy or when reporting impact of different interventions on BRD are good examples. However, this type of composite reference standard can lead to biased estimates due to spectrum bias risk . One can easily admit that a calf with clinical signs of BRD but without abnormal ancillary test may still be truly affected by BRD. This is particularly true when the ancillary test lacks sensitivity. In this situation, composite reference standard would classify this calves with discordant result i) as either a negative case or ii) as a calf not enrolled in the study (depending on negative case definition). These 2 types of considerations would i) decrease the apparent specificity of the new test or ii) increase the new test accuracy excluding cases with discordant results (which obviously may be the typical clinical cases where the clinician want to use another test to determine the \"true\" patient's status). The Californian scoring system is relatively easy to implement in a dairy farm since the clinical signs evaluated are dichotomised (normal vs. abnormal). The different weights we found for these specific clinical signs slightly differs from what was originally reported Love et al., 2014) . This is not surprising since external validation of prediction rules most often justified some changes when compared with initial findings (Steyerberg, 2008; Collins et al., 2015) . When looking more specifically on the main differences between the relative weights found in the current study vs the initial report of Californian score we can note that the weight attributed to the dyspnea and cough was higher in our study (representing 28.6% and 22.8% of the total points, respectively) than initially reported (11.8% for both signs). In contrast, eye discharge's weight was lower in the current study (1.4%) than in Love et al. (2014) study where it represents 11.8% of the score. The rectal temperature weight was similar in both scores (10% vs 11.8% in Californian score). In the present study, rather than presenting new clinical signs or new categorization for the clinical signs (for example: temperature) that were assessed, we focused our attention on updating prediction rules. This strategy has been reported as a better approach to optimize prediction rule rather than creating a different rule, which can in term limit the application in the field (Toll et al., 2008) . As an example, in 2008 more than 60 different prediction rules (with different covariates) existed to estimate the risk breast cancer in human medicine (Toll et al., 2008) . This would obviously become a limitation for the physician who cannot intuitively know which one is the best. Therefore, it could be discouraging to use any prediction rule.",

In this study, case definition was a composite reference standard with abnormal thoracic ultrasound or auscultation findings which may either include misclassified animals or calves with non-active pneumonia lesions. This risk of bias was avoided using a latent class approach. One limitation of the present study is due to the imperfect test that was used as a proxy of BRD. Thoracic ultrasound is a fast and reliable test to detect BRD induced lung lesions (Ollivett et al., 2015) . Moreover, it can be performed even by relatively novice ultrasound operator (Buczinski et al., 2013) . Thoracic ultrasound findings correlates with necropsy findings (which can be considered as a gold standard) in chronic (Rabeling et al., 1998) , subclinical BRD cases (Ollivett et al., 2015) and experimentally induced Mannheimia haemolytica infection (Ollivett et al., 2013) . However, lung consolidation can be absent in early BRD cases or viral pneumonia (false negative case) and false positive cases may occur when lung consolidations are the consequences of a previous BRD episode but now inactive (ie. animal that previously had BRD but who will now not benefit from treatment). Other lung lesions associated with ultrasonographic lung consolidation (atelectasia or pulmonary tumor) may also occur (Lichtenstein et al., 2009) . The sensitivity analysis showed that the informative prior on ultrasound accuracy had little impact on posterior distributions (model 2).",

These priors had limited impacts on posterior probabilities as shown by sensitivity analysis. Interestingly, there was some discrepancies between experts and for some clinical profiles (posterior densities very different from priors). These discrepancies may reflect several mechanisms inherent to dichotomous scoring system and clinical decision-making. Three of the four profiles where either the expert did not agree or where posterior densities changed from priors densities included increased rectal temperature (\u226539.2\u00b0C). Although very simple to understand, categorization of a dynamic continuous biologic process has some limitations. For example, a 39.2\u00b0C calf with slight nasal discharge and a 40.5\u00b0C calf with bilateral purulent nasal discharge would have received the same clinical score. However, most of clinicians would admit that the probability of BRD in these two calves are quite different. The clinical thinking and reasoning is impacted when estimating the risk (best guess) of BRD probability by the spectrum of clinical signs included in a scoring system. This process would indeed influence the predicted probability. This may also explain why some posterior densities where significantly different from prior densities because LCM models considers the information lost in the categorization process.",

In Qu\u00e9bec dairy farms with preweaned calves' enzootic pneumonia, bacteria were most frequently isolated from deep nasopharyngeal swabs. Viruses were uncommonly present except for bovine coronavirus at least in one recent study (Francoz et al., 2015) . The exact role of coronavirus in BRD complex remains uncertain. We tried to avoid bias in the present study using a random sampling of farms considered representative of the Qu\u00e9bec dairy industry. From 6 (where only 6 calves were present) to 12 calves (where 12 or more preweaned calves were present) were selected as a requirement of our initial study (Buczinski et al., 2018) .

Using a Bayesian framework and including expert conditional means priors, it was possible to optimize an existing score which can be further used in practice. The different predicted probability for calves with various clinical signs have been reported and can be helpful for decision-making when using this score in practice. Dairy practitioners could either use the updated clinical score selecting the optimal cut-off depending on the clinical context of application (high vs. low expected prevalence of respiratory problems) or directly use the results of the 64 clinical profiles probability results. As with any diagnostic or prediction study, the findings of this study need to be confirmed, updated, and refined by future studies, particularly using different populations of calves. The applications of these clinical signs at the group level would also be helpful to decide when a group of calves is at high (vs. low) risk of being BRD affected.",
