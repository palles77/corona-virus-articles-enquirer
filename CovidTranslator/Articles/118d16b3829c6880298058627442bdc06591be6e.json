Clinical signs included refusing sucking, no interest in grouping, neck rigidity, tremors and muscular spasms, ataxia, and hind-limb paralysis. All mice had to be euthanized from 70 to 78 hpi. The supernatant of brain homogenate was used to inoculate C6/36 cells, and CPE was visible at \u224896 hpi for the first passage and at 72 hpi for second and third passages. The identity of B58 as JEV was confirmed by PCR sequencing. The complete genome sequence of both isolates was then determined.

            "text": "In this study, we analyzed the complete genome sequences of 2 bat JEV isolates. Although previous serologic studies (15) in Yunnan Province and other parts of China. The bats tend to roost in trees, caves, and roofs of residential properties in close proximity to rice paddocks and pig pens, providing ample opportunity for cross-species transmission among bats and between bats and other animals. Notably, the 2 JEV strains most closely related to the bat viruses were all isolated from Yunnan Province, LiYujie from a human in 1979 and BN19 from mosquitoes in 1982 (Figure) . Our study indicates that the same virus is circulating in hosts of at least 4 different species (human, mosquito, and 2 different bat species), and likely in birds as well, highlighting the broad host range of JEVs in this area. We emphasize that the 4 closely related strains (B58, GB30, LiYujie, and BN19) were isolated over 2 decades, which suggests that the virus was stably maintained in the region, perhaps by circulating in disparate hosts. The findings from our current study highlight the potential importance of bats in human JE outbreaks in the region. Needed additional studies of JEV in bats should include the determination of viremia in bats of different species and potential seasonal variation of viral loads among different bats at different geographic locations. This data would provide a better assessment of risks posed by JEV in bats. Table  1 for more details of the strains used in this analysis and their GenBank accession numbers. Ile Lys *These 8 aa residues of the envelope protein are shown to play a key role in neurovirulence. They vary substantially between the attenuated vaccine strain (SA14-14-2) and the virulent strain (Nakayama).",
