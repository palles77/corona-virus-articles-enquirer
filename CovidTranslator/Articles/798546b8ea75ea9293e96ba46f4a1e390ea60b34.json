            "text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of voids in tall buildings on the surrounding wind environment. With the development of modular technology, there has been a new method of building high-rise buildings. Currently, more and more high-rise buildings often use void spaces to reduce the wind resistance and utilize wind turbines by using wind power to create sky gardens. In this study, CFD (computer fluid dynamic) technology was used to simulate the wind environment around the buildings. The research focuses on the size, distribution and quantity of the concavity, which usually is defined as sky gardens. It is found that when the area of the opening is the same, the more number of opening, the more strengthened and distributed vertical wind velocity behind the building can be. The wind shadow area at the pedestrian height is further reduced. For holes distribution, the optimum ratio of the spacing between concavities to the void size for wind environment of tall buildings ranges from 1 to 3, which can disperse the surrounding heat in more efficiency and weaken the wind velocity in the lowest level. Therefore, in high-rise buildings, the number and distribution of the openings will have different effects on the wind environment around the buildings.",

            "text": "Wind damage in cities was usually caused by tall buildings because they often produced unpredicted or dangerous wind environment at the pedestrian level (Melbourne and Joubert 1971; Murakami et al. 1986 ). In spite of uncomfortable environment for pedestrian was usually attributed to the high wind velocity, wind-related environmental problems have transmitted from dangerous high wind velocity to disadvantageous low wind speeds (Chetwittayachan et al. 2002; Goyal and Sidhartha 2002; Tsang et al. 2012) . For example, Hong Kong's dense high-rise buildings and large platform structures had greatly reduced wind penetration, resulting in poor low wind speeds at the pedestrian level (Chetwittayachan et al. 2009; Goyal and Sidhartha 2012) . Extensive stagnant air promoted airborne pathogens, such as the SARS virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), posing a threat to public health (Yu et al. 2004 ). In addition, the average wind speed was lower than the minimum average wind speed of 1.5 m/s required by Hong Kong's air circulation assessment, which will cause outdoor heat discomfort to pedestrians, especially during the hot summer months (Ng 2009) Therefore, people have increasingly focused on low airflow velocity districts around high-rise buildings, which may result in poor outdoor air quality. Research done so far with respect to airflow condition around the construction has been performed for more than 50 years. Blocken and Carmelie (2004) reviewed a lot of researches in terms of outdoor human comfort degree studies since from the 1960s and found studies about airflow environment at pedestrian level mainly concentrated on the poor surroundings caused by strong wind flow around high-rise buildings (Wiren 1975; Stathopoulos and Storms 1986; Uematsu et al. 1992; Jamieson et al. 1992 ;",

Many impact factors such as shape, space layout, orientation of buildings and street canyons were studied, and the results provide precious insights in view of the pedestrian-level wind environments around buildings (Stathopoulos et al. 1992; Visser et al. 2000) . Nevertheless, most of these studies only concentrated on small regions with high wind speed such as building corner nearby. For a group of buildings or row of constructions, some researches had been done primarily investigated the passage between constructions. The height and width of the building, the separation between the building and the podium ventilation effects were performed to be studied by the different architectural shapes consisting of single building, two buildings, a row of building and so on. Natural ventilation and pedestrian comfort were also assessed via experimental design and analysis (Chan et al. 2001 (Chan et al. , 2003 . Note that, beyond that there were a few studies to investigate the influences of modern building structures (such as buildings with platforms) on the relatively large area of low flow velocity at the leeward of the building. Blocken and Stathopoulos (2013) performed a comprehensive investigation in regard to CFD simulation on pedestrian-level wind condition utilizing a normalized mean wind speed (U/Ur) rather than speed ratio K because it could easily combine specific wind climates to determine wind speed statistics based on the magnitude and frequency of occurrence. This contributed to determine effectively the boundaries of low wind velocity region. For instance, the normalized mean wind speed (U/U r ) about 0.3 was needed so as to achieve a threshold wind velocity approximately 1.5 m/s that was the lowest wind velocity observable at the pedestrian level (Lawson and Penwarden 1975) . Therefore, U/U r lower than 0.3 was considered as the low wind velocity area which had negative influence on the ventilation. This pedestrian horizontal wind speed of 1.5 m/s threshold was consistent with Ng (2009) as the Hong Kong air circulation assessment criteria, taking into account the environment temperature and solar irradiance at that time. It can be seen from that definition of area utilizing wind climate in Hong Kong was a good method. The normalized mean wind velocity (U/Ur) distribution given here was known as a general result of the characteristics of airflow around the object building.",

The perform indicator is constructed in the basis of the normalized wind velocity of WVA (wind velocity amplification factor) and pollutant concentration CR (concentration ratio). Whole CFD simulation is validated by a wind tunnel measurement by Tsang et al. (2012) of normalized wind speed. This research results could contribute architects to construct sky courts more reasonable and utilize special positions of voids to harvest wind energy to produce power.

In this case, the mean difference between the medium and coarse grid along these lines is 0.8% while the fine grid is almost the same as the reference grid. Hence, the medium grid is chosen as the CFD simulated model.",

Under the condition of two holes and three holes, overall WVA enhances in the range of 20-80 m with larger than 1indicating that the building under this condition could be conducive to enhance the surrounding airflow quality. In addition, it can also be seen that the range of increase in wind speed is larger than that in a single void opening.

It can be seen that as the distribution of the openings along the vertical direction of the building is more discrete, the distribution of wind speed along the height direction in the wind shadow area behind the building will vary greatly. When R ranges between 1 and 3, the more uniform the wind speed distribution in the vertical direction of the building wind shadow area, the more stable the wind environment, and the smaller the wind loss. When R is less than 1 and greater than 3, the wind speed distribution in the wind shadow area is more unstable, and a larger wind shadow area will occur. The airflow velocity amplification factor will also be somewhat smaller, which is not conducive to heat loss. For example, When R is 0, it can be clearly seen that the wind speed amplification factor is gradually increasing in the range of 30-60 m. This is because the three openings are concentrated in the middle of the building, so the wind amplification effect at this place is the best. When R=4, the increase of the WVA values mainly concentrate in the range of 10-20 m, 40-50 m, and 90-100 m which distributes more discrete.",

            "text": "As can be seen from the analysis of Fig. 12 , when the RD is 0, the wind speed at 40 m is well amplified, and the wind speed amplification factor tends to 1. After 40 m, the overall wind speed is blocked, so the wind speed amplification factor is very low. When RD is 1, the WVA at 60 m is similar to that when RD is 0, but at this time, the fluctuation range of the wind speed amplification factor is increased. When RD Li and Chen / Building Simulation / Vol. 13, No. 2 432 is 2, the distribution of the opening is more dispersed, and the fluctuation range of the wind speed amplification factor is further increased. The wind speed within the height of 80 m is fluctuating. As the number of RD enhances, the numbers of wind shadow areas further increase. Nevertheless, even if the wind shadow area is increased, the wind speed amplification factor of the upper wind shadow area is far larger than the far end. Figure 13 shows that in the case where the upper end is open, the change in the wind speed is almost opposite to the lower end opening. When the RU is 1, the average value of the wind speed amplification factor is the largest, and the fluctuation amplitude is relatively small, because that the hole dispersion degree in this case is moderate, and the influence range is large with a larger wind shadow area. When the lower end is open, it can be seen that the mean wind speed amplification factor is the same when RD is 1 and 2. But for case RD1, the overall distribution is more uniform and the fluctuation amplitude is smaller. Therefore, when RD is 1, for the lower end opening, the wind environment is the best, which is conducive to building energy conservation and heat loss. Along this vertical direction, z represents the height of testing point and H indicates the building height (Fig. 14) . When CR value is larger than one, the better the pollutant dispersion situation (Figs. 14, 15 ). Following observations can be made: \uf06c With the number of voids increase, the air contaminants disperse more efficiently. The best pollutant dissemination condition is achieved when the holes almost completely distribute along the building i.e. case 9A. This is mainly because that the air pollutants locating at the leeward of building can be flowed by the wind through the hollow areas. Consequently, more construction voids can promote efficiently the loss of pollutants situating downstream of the building. For example, in cases of A7 and A9, all CR values are under 0.5 which is apparently smaller than the averaged CR value of 2.38, 2.11 and 1.27 for cases A0, A3 and A5, respectively. \uf06c The distribution of air contaminants is related to the building voids positions. The distance between hollow areas on the building could significantly influence the pollutant gathering situation in the leeward of construction. For distance between holes on building larger than twice height of holes such as case B3, the pollutant gathering effect at the behind of gap between voids enhances increasingly by enlarging the distance between holes. On the other hand, it should be noted that for cases B0 to B2, air contaminants behind the gap between holes could also be dispersed effectively. For example, CR values of 0.7 and 1.8 for case B2 at the height of z/H being 0.3 and 0.7 are much lower than that under same height for cases B3 and B4 which are 4, 5, 4, 5 respectively. \uf06c For wind flow condition of hollow volumes where position at the end of building (case C), the discretization of cavities in building could apparently improve pollutant dispersion condition behind architecture wherever the voids locating at the top or bottom of construction. For example, with regard to case C, the z/H range under 1.5 of CR value for case CU1 locates at 0.7, which is significantly larger than that of 0.5 for case CU3. This result distinctly shows that the pollutant condition is improved around the middle of building by increasing the opening discrete degree. It is an important conclusion, especially in view of sky court which increasingly occurs in the roof of high-rise building, the decomposed distribution for this air garden could effectively enhance the status of loss of pollutant dispersion in the middle of high-rise building.",

Ayhan and Sa\u011flam (2012) found that implanting cross-holes in building is an effective approach to enhance wind velocity to utilize wind energy. In addition, voids in building also can be considered as refuge storey which is indispensable for high-rise building. Hence, this dual purpose of openings has increasingly received attention from scholars due to its economic and environmental friendly. For wind energy utilization, most studies mainly focused Fig. 16(a) ). It concluded that the mean airflow velocity in holes can be enhanced by 25% if the recessed area is set at the inlet and outlet of opening and the curved wall is arranged at the corners. Apart from this, as the convergence -divergence channel is implemented, the average velocity increases by about 33%. Zhou et al. (2017) also performed some similar researches in terms of the opening patterns ( Fig. 16(b) ). The results showed that the composite prism diffuser pattern of holes could apparently amplified the wind velocity and the best aspect ratio for wind harvesting using this shape is 0.6. In addition to the above academic research, method of openings integrated wind turbine has been applied to practical projects. Figures 16(c) , (d), (e) present the case of Bahrain World Trade Centre, Castle House in London and Pearl River Tower. As the first wind energy integrated building all over the world, three 225 kW horizontal-axis wind turbines are mounted on the connecting bridge of Bahrain World Trade Centre in the tunnel shaped between two skyscrapers. The two particular shapes of buildings apparently lead to the large accumulated wind effect. In case of Castle House skyscraper in London, three horizontal axis wind turbines with 9 m diameter are used at the top of this building to meet the requirement of the entire mansion lighting. For Pearl River Tower in China, the voids are constructed for double goals of wind energy harvesting and refuge space. There are four tunnels shaped on the building with bell-mouth pattern at the inlet and outlet of openings as shown in Fig. 16(c) . Simultaneously, the concave wall on the south side and the convex wall on the north side could effectively magnify the wind speed and promote air to penetrate the tunnel. In this case, helix-shape vertical axis wind turbines mounted in every hollow can take fully advantage of wind energy to support whole mansion.",

Therefore, it should be fully considered when designing the building.",
