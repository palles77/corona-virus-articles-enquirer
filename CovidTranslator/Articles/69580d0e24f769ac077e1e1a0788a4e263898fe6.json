Using chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to study adaptation to a mosquito vector, we evaluated mutations associated with recently evolved sub-lineages. Multiple Aedes albopictus-adaptive fitness peaks became available after CHIKV acquired an initial adaptive (E1-A226V) substitution, permitting rapid lineage diversification observed in nature. All second-step mutations involved replacements by glutamine or glutamic acid of E2 glycoprotein amino acids in the acid-sensitive region, providing a framework to anticipate additional A. albopictus-adaptive mutations. The combination of second-step adaptive mutations into a single, 'super-adaptive' fitness peak also predicted the future emergence of CHIKV strains with even greater transmission efficiency in some current regions of endemic circulation, followed by their likely global spread.",

The number and nature of host-switching adaptations for a given pathogen are largely determined by the shape of the corresponding viral fitness landscapes [1] [2] [3] . As highlighted by a recent study of experimental adaptation of highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A viruses for transmission between mammals, detailed information about the shape of adaptive landscapes would allow for targeted assessment of the epidemic potential of a given pathogen strain. This information could provide health authorities with a head start in their efforts to mitigate or prevent the public health impacts of new emergences 4 . However, to our knowledge, no detailed characterization of the adaptive landscapes exists for any important pathogen, primarily owing to the complexity of experimental settings and conditions needed to accurately recreate in the laboratory the conditions required for natural transmission and maintenance.",

            "text": "To overcome this limitation, we utilized a combination of phylogenetic and experimental approaches to study recent events in chikungunya virus (CHIKV) evolution that will facilitate the inference of future emergence trends. A novel lineage of the mosquito-borne CHIKV (Togaviridae: Alphavirus) emerged in 2004 in coastal Kenya, followed by its expansive spread via infected travellers to produce a series of epidemics of severe, often chronic arthralgic disease throughout the Indian Ocean basin and Southeast Asia, as well as in Europe (Fig. 1a) 5, 6 . It has been estimated that these emerging CHIKV strains from the Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) have infected up to 10 million people to cause debilitating arthralgia 5, 6 and have also been implicated in several thousand human deaths [7] [8] [9] . Unlike previous epidemics, where CHIKV was transmitted among humans primarily by the highly urbanized, tropical mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti, A. (Stegomyia) albopictus has been incriminated as the primary CHIKV vector during the majority of recent IOL outbreaks, including those on several islands of the western Indian Ocean, parts of India, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, China and Italy [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . This highly invasive mosquito has spread since 1985 from its native distribution in Asia to all continents except Antarctica 16 . Furthermore, unlike A. aegypti, A. albopictus survives in both tropical and temperate climates, permitting it to transmit CHIKV in northern latitudes such as Italy 17 .",

The E1-A226V substitution provided a major fitness increase (50-100-fold) 19 followed by an additional fitness increase (four to sixfold), caused by E2-L210Q, once CHIKV reached the initial A. albopictusadaptive fitness peak 18 . This stepwise adaptive process for this cross-species arbovirus jump 18, 20 was similar to the adaptive emergence of the SARS coronavirus for human-to-human transmission 21 . Phylogenetic and epidemiologic studies indicate that E1-A226V was selected convergently by at least four different CHIKV lineages in different geographic locations 6, 11, 12, 14, [22] [23] [24] , whereas E2-L210Q was detected only in closely related strains from states of Kerala and Orissa, India in 2009 and 2010, respectively 25, 26 (Fig. 1a) . Interestingly, E2-210Q is absent in all other CHIKV sub-lineages that acquired the E1-A226V change (Fig. 1b) , posing the question of whether acquisition of this second-step A. albopictus-adaptive substitution was a unique event in CHIKV evolution, or whether other viral sub-lineages have acquired different second-step mutations (to occupy independent A. albopictus-adaptive peaks), which like the effect of E2-L210Q, further increase CHIKV fitness for infection of A. albopictus.",

Several sub-lineage-specific, second-step A. albopictus-adaptive mutations were identified, all involving replacements by glutamine or glutamic acid in the acid-sensitive region (ASR) of the E2 glycoprotein. These findings indicate that, after acquisition of an initial A. albopictus-adaptive (E1-A226V) substitution, multiple second-step fitness peaks became available for CHIKV, enabling rapid lineage diversification. Apparent structural and functional similarities observed among all second-step A. albopictusadaptive mutations enabled predictions of additional A. albopictus-adaptive CHIKV mutations. Finally, analysis of CHIKV expressing a combination of second-step adaptive mutations revealed the existence of a 'super-A. albopictus-adaptive' fitness peak, which suggested the future emergence of CHIKV strains with even greater transmission efficiency in the future.",

This sl1 subsequently spread into Southeast Asia, where it was isolated beginning in 2008. The last isolates were reported in 2012 in Cambodia 27 , suggesting its persistence in the region. Viruses from sl2 and sl3 were identified only in 2008 during a Sri Lankan outbreak and have not been reported since 11 .

The complementary DNA (cDNA) clone used to generate this strain was genetically marked with a synonymous mutation that ablated an ApaI restriction site, allowing for the determination of its ratio to competitors by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR followed by a restriction digest of amplicon DNA. Changes in this ratio before and after competition infections indicated relative fitness values of the mutant compared with the SL07-226V_Apa CHIKV strain. Viruses were rescued by RNA electroporation into Vero cells and fitness for A. albopictus infection of SL07-226V_Apa was assessed in direct competition experiments against the unmarked, wild-type (wt) SL07-226V strain; the synonymous marker itself does not affect CHIKV fitness in vitro or in vivo 19 . Infections that disseminated from the mosquito midgut into the haemocoel, a requirement for transmission, were assessed by detection of CHIKV in the head, while initial infection was determined by detection of virus in the remainder of the mosquito body. Both SL07-226V_Apa and SL07-226V viruses contained the first-step E1-A226V-adaptive substitution, representing a typical genetic background of IOL strains from India upon which selection of second-step mutations occurred. In addition to sequencing each cDNA clone to ensure that no errors accompanied mutagenesis, the genetic integrity of mutagenized viruses was ensured by comparison of the specific infectivity of viral RNA and virus titres post electroporation into Vero cells (Supplementary Tables 1-5) .",

We also assessed fitness in Vero African green monkey kidney and human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cell lines (fibroblasts are considered to be initial sites of human infections) 29 , and in a surrogate human model, 2-day-old infant mice, using competition assays against SL07-226V. Although they had no effect on fitness for A. albopictus, the sl2 mutations were also included in these experiments. The sl1, sl2 and sl3-B mutations had no significant effect on dissemination of CHIKV into the heads of A. aegypti (one-tailed McNemar test, P40.05). In addition, there was no increase in the relative RNA ratio associated with mutations from sl1, sl2 and sl3-B versus SL07-226V in A. aegypti bodies at 10 dpi ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ), indicating that these mutations did not increase CHIKV fitness for infection of this vector. Similarly, the relative RNA SL07-226V_Apa-sl1:SL07-226V_Apa-sl3-B ratio was not increased in supernatants of Vero and HFF cells over SL07-226V, when assayed at 1 and 2 dpi (Fig. 3) . Infection of 2day-old mice with mixtures of SL07-226V and SL07-226V_Apa-sl1 or SL07-226V_Apa-sl3-B led to slight decreases in the relative RNA amount of the latter strain at 1 dpi in mouse blood, which subsequently increased to equal amounts at 2 dpi (Fig. 4) . These data suggest the lack of an overall fitness gain in these surrogate CHIKV human models associated with mutations from sl1 and sl3-B, supporting the hypothesis that some if not all of these mutations were selected specifically by A. albopictus. Interestingly, only SL07-226V_Apa-sl2 exhibited increased fitness over SL07-226V in infant mice at a single time point (1 dpi; Fig. 4c ). This might indicate that at least some sl2 mutations were acquired as a result of CHIKV adaptation to a vertebrate host, presumably humans. The restoration of the viral competitors' ratio to almost 1:1 in the serum of all of mice analysed on 2 dpi suggests that their replication occurred independently from one another, and that they reached plateaus at different times, rather than accumulation of additional mutations affecting the competition outcome.",

The E2-K252Q substitution caused a significant increase in the ability of CHIKV to develop a disseminated infection (one-tailed McNemar test, Pr0.001), and resulted in a 45.9-fold increase in the relative RNA ratio over SL07-226V_Apa in bodies of mosquitoes from Thailand and Galveston colonies ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ). Introduction of nsP2-L539S into SL07-226V also resulted in a slight but insignificant fitness increase in the level of CHIKV dissemination Fig. 6b-d) . These results suggested that some of these mutations could be influenced by epistatic interactions. Indeed, simultaneous expression of only the E3-S18F and E2-R198Q substitutions in SL07-226V generated a 11.5-fold increase in the ability to develop a disseminated infection in A. albopictus (one-tailed McNemar test, Po0.001) and resulted in a 10.2-fold increase in the relative RNA amount in mosquito bodies over SL07-226V ( Supplementary Fig. 6e ), to the level previously observed for the triple mutant SL07-226V_Apa-sl3 \u00fe 198Q (Fig. 2g,i) . These results indicated that, for sl3-B, second-step adaptation to A. albopictus was achieved by the acquisition of two synergistic mutations, E3-S18F and E2-R198Q. Considering that E2-R198Q was selected in the sl3 background, which had already acquired E3-S18F (Fig. 1b) , the acquisition of E2-R198Q was likely the result of direct selection by A. albopictus. The evolutionary basis of the E3-S18F substitution in sl3 remains unknown, but it may have resulted from a founder effect or drift if it confers no phenotype on its own.",

            "text": "Mutations act through common adaptive mechanism. An intriguing common feature of novel A. albopictus-adaptive mutations from sl1 and sl3-B is that they all result in the acquisition of glutamine residues in the E2 glycoprotein (E2-252Q and E2-198Q), like the A. albopictus-adaptive E2-L210Q substitution previously characterized in sl4 18 . As described above, CHIKV fitness for A. albopictus infection was not significantly affected by the sl2 mutations, which may reflect that this sl was the only one that did not acquire glutamine E2 substitutions (Fig. 2c,e; Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Previously, we demonstrated that E2-L210Q primarily mediates more efficient initial CHIKV infection of A. albopictus midgut cells, which subsequently leads to more efficient dissemination into the haemocoel 18 . To investigate whether the similarities among the E2-252Q, E2-198Q and E2-210Q substitutions reflect a common effector mechanism, we analysed the impact of these substitutions on CHIKV fitness during initial infection/replication of/in the A. albopictus midgut. The E2-L252Q mutation alone and combined (E3-S18F/E2-R198Q) mutations were responsible for 5.7-and 6.1-fold increases in the relative CHIKV RNA ratios, respectively, over control SL07-226V_Apa, as early as 1 dpi (Figs 5 and 6 ). These results support the hypothesis of a common effector mechanism for all second-step A. albopictus-adaptive mutations. Interestingly, the E2-R198Q sl3-B substitution alone was also associated with a small (1.6-fold) increase in its RNA ratio in mosquito midguts at 1 dpi, but this effect did not extend to day 2, when SL07-226V_Apa rebounded (Fig. 6c ). More rapid replication of SL07-226V_Apa between 1 and 2 dpi might be explained if E2-R198Q promotes initial CHIKV infectivity of midgut cells, while E3-S18F stabilizes (probably via an indirect interaction) the E2 glycoprotein with 198Q during spike and virion assembly in midgut cells.",

All second-step A. albopictus-adaptive mutations in the E2 protein shared apparent structural and functional similarities, as well as a spatial arrangement along an axis formed by E2 residues 210-252 (Fig. 7a) . These similarities raised the hypothesis that the substitution by glutamine of additional amino acids along this E2 axis will also increase fitness for A. albopictus infection, potentially leading to the selection and emergence of novel CHIKV sub-lineages. To test this hypothesis, we generated five novel CHIKV mutants expressing glutamine along this axis at E2 positions 213, 232, 233, 248 and 254 in the SL07-226V background (Fig. 7a) and tested them in competition against SL07-226V_Apa in A. albopictus. These mutations resulted in a range of phenotypes indicated by differences in relative amounts of viral RNA in mosquito bodies and the ability to infect and disseminate into mosquito heads (Fig. 7) : (1) slightly attenuated to neutral (E2-T213Q and E2-H232Q, respectively); (2) slightly to moderately beneficial (E2-K254Q and E2-L248Q, respectively); and (3) highly beneficial (E2-K233Q). Introduction of the E2-K233Q substitution into SL07-226V resulted in CHIKV that was fivefold more efficient in developing disseminated A. albopictus infection (one-tailed McNemar test, Po0.001) and led to a 4.4fold increase in the relative RNA ratio over the SL07-226V_Apa competitor in mosquito bodies (Fig. 7k,o) , which closely resembled the phenotypes of A. albopictus-adaptive mutations found in sl1, sl3-B and sl4 strains (Fig. 2) 18 . This E2-K233Q substitution was also tested for its effect on infection/replication in A. albopictus midguts during the initial phase of CHIKV infection. A 3.6-fold increase in relative RNA amount was observed in midguts at 1 dpi, which gradually increased to 8.9-fold at 3 dpi ( Supplementary Fig. 7b ). These data suggested that E2-K233Q, similarly to the previously characterized A. albopictus-adaptive mutations, acts at the levels of initial midgut infection and/or replication.",

Although no sequences had E2-233Q, we found E2-233E in one CHIKV isolate that was most closely related to sl2, the only sub-lineage for which we did not find A. albopictus-adaptive mutations in signature sequences (Fig. 1b) . Interestingly, the same residue was found previously in a CHIKV antibody escape mutant that had been passaged in A. albopictus-derived C6/36 cells, but not in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells 30 . To determine whether E2-K233E also increases CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus, it was introduced into the SL07-226V background, and tested in competition experiment against SL07-226V_Apa. Surprisingly, the increase in CHIKV fitness due to the E2-K233E substitution was higher than that generated by any previously characterized second-step A. albopictus-adaptive mutation. No individual mosquitoes that ingested mixed competition blood meals exhibited a disseminated infection with only wt virus in the head, and wt RNA was present in mosquito body homogenates only in amounts that were insufficient for quantitative analysis (Fig. 7l,p) . A 5.7-fold increase occurred in E2-K233E RNA over SL07-226V_Apa at 1 dpi ( Supplementary Fig. 7c) , which was similar to the effects of the E2-K210Q (fivefold) 18 and E2-K252Q (5.7-fold (Fig. 5c) ) substitutions. These findings suggest that, in addition to its effect on midgut infection, E2-K233E also increases CHIKV fitness in other mosquito organs/tissues. In addition to the E2-K233E substitution, the artificial E2-K234E substitution also resulted in a significant (one-tailed McNemar test, Po0.001) increase in fitness for infection of A. albopictus (Fig. 7m,q) . Interestingly, introduction of E instead of the naturally occurring Q at position E2-252 also led to a significant increase (one-tailed McNemar test, P \u00bc 0.026) in fitness in A. albopictus (Fig. 7n,r) , indicating that amino acids Q and E are nearly interchangeable for this phenotype.",

Identification of several second-step A. albopictus-adaptive mutations in the E2 gene raised the question of whether simultaneous expression of two or more such mutations might result in an additive or cooperative effect on CHIKV fitness, and thus could lead to selection of even more A. albopictus-transmissible strains in the future. To address this possibility, we combined substitutions E2-L210Q and E2-K252Q, which epidemiological data indicate circulate in India 11 and Southeast Asia, respectively (Fig. 1) . If there is an additive or cooperative effect between E2-L210Q and E2-K252Q, a 'super-adapted' strain could emerge in either location through simple Darwinian evolution. To test this hypothesis, we introduced mutations E2-L210Q and E2-K252Q into the SL07-226V_Apa background and tested the resulting double mutant (DM) virus in competition experiments against viruses expressing these individual E2 mutations. The results revealed 3.4-and 2.4-fold increases in the relative RNA amount ratio of DM compared with the E2-210Q and E2-252Q single-mutant competitors, respectively, in whole A. albopictus bodies assessed at 10 dpi (Fig. 8 ). In addition, the DM was significantly more efficient (one-tailed McNemar test, Po0.05) in its ability to develop a disseminated infection represented by virus reaching A. albopictus heads, compared with either of the single-mutant competitors (Fig. 8) . This indicated that simultaneous expression of both second-step mutations led to an additive increase in CHIKV fitness. The fitness of the DM was also compared with the single mutants in 2-day-old mice. Although the RNA ratio of DM virus in mouse blood decreased slightly (1.5-fold) compared with either of the single-mutant competitors at 1 dpi, this ratio returned to almost 1.0 at a WT mut WT+mut WT+226V 2 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 8) . These results indicate that the DM and single mutants have similar chances of being delivered orally to a mosquito via viremia. Overall, our data suggest that CHIKVadaptive landscapes should favour the selection of a third-step A. albopictus-adaptive substitution in strains currently circulating in India and Southeast Asia.",

RNA was extracted from BM at 0 dpi or 4 pools of 9-10 mosquitoes per pool at 7 dpi followed by RT-PCR analysis and ApaI digestion to distinguish marked (wt) from unmarked (mutant) competitors. The relative fitness (RF) was determined as a geometric mean of the ratio between mut:wt bands in an amplicon derived from the sample, divided by the starting ratio of mut:wt bands in the BM. ND, data not determined. 25 . Importantly, in subsequent years, both of these sub-lineages invaded Southeast Asia (Fig. 1) 27 and northeastern India, conferring their evolutionary success. Our data demonstrate that, after CHIKV reached the first-step E1-A226V A. albopictus-adaptive peak, its evolution was no longer constrained to a monolithic peak and multiple adaptive peaks of relatively equal fitness became available for Darwinian evolution. This finding challenges the traditional 20,32 two-step model of host switching adaptive evolution (Fig. 9a) . Instead of forcing convergence of lineages into a single high-fitness peak by the acquisition of consecutive (first, second and third step and so on) adaptive mutations, the first-step E1-A226V adaptation permitted rapid lineage diversification (Fig. 9b) as different sets of secondary mutations provided similar, additional fitness gains. Although phylogenetic evidence indicates that the E1-A226V substitution preceded the signature substitutions in sl1, sl3 and sl4, our data do not indicate whether there was any dependence of the latter on the former. The order of acquisition may simply reflect the far stronger selective advantage of E1-A226V compared with the other substitutions 18 , which therefore would be expected to occur first during the evolution of CHIKV in regions inhabited by A. albopictus.",

Alternatively, sl2-specific mutations could have been acquired by this lineage as a result of CHIKV adaptation to alternative hosts, possibly humans. For instance, SL07-226V_Apa-sl2 was the only virus that exhibited increased fitness over SL07-226V (wt strain) in infant mice at early time points post infection (1 dpi) and in HFF cells, while viruses with sl1-and sl3-specific mutations were both outcompeted by wt CHIKV in these surrogate models of human infection (Figs 3 and 4) . Interestingly, sl2 acquired the E1-K211N substitution convergently with strains of the old Asian CHIKV genotype that diverged from East Central South African ancestral genotype at least 60-70 years earlier than the IOL lineage 38 . Recently, we demonstrated that evolution of the Asian CHIKV genotype is epistatically constrained in its ability to adapt to A. albopictus 2 , which indirectly supports the hypothesis that sl2-specific second-step mutations were selected as a result of CHIKV adaptation to an alternative host.",

The existences of latter lineage in nature should depend on its ability to invade and successfully compete with the IOL lineage in new geographic regions where A. albopictus is not abundant. This scenario is consistent with recent CHIKV invasion of the Caribbean islands, where it is apparently transmitted primarily by A. aegypti 39 . The introduction of the Asian rather than the IOL lineage may have been stochastic, but our previous results 2 predict that these Caribbean strains will have a limited ability to adapt to A. albopictus, which may limit their spread into temperate regions of the Americas.

All A. albopictus-adaptive amino-acid substitutions we identified are located along or immediately adjacent to an axis formed between glutamine residues at E2 positions 210 and 252 (Figs 2 and 7) 28 , and share the common effect of increasing initial infectivity/replication in A. albopictus midgut cells (Figs 5 and 6; Supplementary Fig. 7) . The importance of this 'axis of substitutions' in the mechanism of adaptation was further supported by its ability to predict that the artificial E2-K233Q substitution would increase CHIKV fitness for infection of A. albopictus to a level comparable to that generated by natural, adaptive mutations (Fig. 7) . In contrast, the second-site substitutions in sl2, which did not show an adaptive advantage, are not located near this axis (Fig. 2) . The variation in effects among substitutions along this axis (Fig. 7) most likely reflects the complexity of intermolecular protein-protein interactions within the CHIKV E3/E2/E1 spike. For instance, penetrance of the A. albopictus-adaptive substitution E2-R198Q from sl3-B requires the additional E3-S18F substitution ( Fig. 2;  Supplementary Fig. 6 ). E3 has been suggested to act as a clamp or brace holding E2 and E1 together during assembly 28, [40] [41] [42] . Thus, E3-S18F may affect how the E2-E1 heterodimer containing E2-198Q is stabilized during assembly. The role of E3-S18F in the penetrance of E2-R198Q suggests that additional mutations may also be required for stabilizing glutamine residues at E2 positions 213, 232 and 248.

Our analysis showed that glutamine and glutamic acid residues at this position have similar effects on CHIKV fitness, and these residues also produce similar phenotypes at E2-252 ( Fig. 7; Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Together, our results demonstrate that the acquisition of either glutamine and/or glutamic acid at multiple positions along the E2-210-252 axis promotes the emergence of novel CHIKV sub-lineages characterized by increased fitness in A. albopictus. Thus, these findings will have important implications for future CHIKV surveillance to identify further adaptation to this important vector.",

Importantly, the ASR region is proposed to undergo a conformational change in response to receptor binding and the low-pH environment of the endosome during entry 28, 40, 43, 44 . Previously, we hypothesized that the first-step E1-A226V substitution increases CHIKV fitness by sensing a favourable lipid composition for insertion of the E1 fusion loop into the target endosomal membrane 2, 19 . Accordingly, the second-step adaptive mutations in the ASR may act by enhancing the effect of E1-A226V in regulating CHIKV fusion dynamics in endosomes of A. albopictus by initiating a targeted, low-pH-induced E2-E1 heterodimer dissociation in the correct compartment, thereby improving fusion loop insertion. In this model, substitutions do not directly modify the receptorbinding site but rather their presence in the ASR may affect the course of entry, perhaps allowing fusion in the early rather than the late endosome. Alternatively, the second-step substitutions may simply increase CHIKV's affinity for one or more receptors expressed on the apical surface of A. albopictus but not A. aegypti midgut epithelial cells, thus resulting in more efficient entry only in the former mosquito.",

These data demonstrate that current CHIKV strains have not yet reached a locally maximum adaptive peak for A. albopictus transmission, and suggest that individual second-step adaptive peaks possess the potential for convergence into a single or multiple 'superadaptive' peaks in the future in at least two endemic locations (Fig. 9b) . Although our results suggest that further adaptation to A. albopictus will not result in major tradeoffs of reduced fitness in A. aegypti or human hosts, the limited fidelity of rodents to model human infections limits our ability to estimate CHIKV fitness for human viremia. Thus, our observation of a slight (B1.5-fold) decrease in replication of the DM compared with single-mutant viruses in infant mice at 1 dpi ( Supplementary  Fig. 8) should be corroborated by infections of nonhuman primates that more accurately reflect human infection 45 . If a slight decrease in human viremia potential accompanies the combination of second-step A. albopictus-adaptive mutations, they may not be efficiently selected in nature.",

Surprisingly, these species-specific adaptations do not have major effects on infection of the alternate urban mosquito vector, A. aegypti, or models for human infection. These findings challenge the trade-off hypothesis for arbovirus evolution, which predicts that most adaptive arbovirus mutations will be deleterious in donor or alternate hosts. Finally, our findings indicate that even more efficient CHIKV transmission by the invasive vector A. albopictus will likely evolve when combinations of these second-step mutations occur in their current ranges of endemic circulation in India and Southeast Asia, followed by their likely global spread.",

Blood meals (BMs) containing 3 \u00c2 10 5 p.f.u. ml \u00c0 1 of 1:1 mixture of viruses (DM and SL07-226V-210Q) (a,c) and (DM and SL07-226V-252Q) (b,d) were presented to A. albopictus. Disseminated CHIKV infection (a,b) and relative CHIKV RNA levels in mosquito bodies (c,d) were assayed at 10 dpi as described above. Graphs (a,b) show numbers and percent of mosquitoes containing DM, single mutant (SM; E2-L210Q or E2-K252Q), or containing both viruses in individual mosquito heads (representing disseminated infections). For each virus pair the difference in number of mosquitoes with disseminated infection of DM versus SM was tested for significance with a one-tailed McNemar test. Gel images (c,d) show change in relative RNA levels for each virus pair. RNA was extracted from BM at 0 dpi or 4 pools of 8 mosquitoes per pool at 10 dpi followed by RT-PCR analysis and ApaI digestion to distinguish marked from unmarked competitors in amplicon gels. The relative fitness (RF) was determined as a geometric mean of the ratio between DM: SM amplicon bands in the sample, divided by the starting ratio of DM: SM bands in the BM.",
