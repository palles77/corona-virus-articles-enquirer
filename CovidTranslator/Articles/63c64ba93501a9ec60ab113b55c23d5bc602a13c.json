            "text": "DNA resequencing arrays enable rapid acquisition of high-quality sequence data. This technology represents a promising platform for rapid highresolution genotyping of microorganisms. Traditional array-based resequencing methods have relied on the use of specific PCR-amplified fragments from the query samples as hybridization targets. While this specificity in the target DNA population reduces the potential for artifacts caused by cross-hybridization, the subsampling of the query genome limits the sequence coverage that can be obtained and therefore reduces the technique's resolution as a genotyping method. We have developed and validated an Affymetrix Inc. GeneChip array-based, whole-genome resequencing platform for Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia. A set of bioinformatic filters that targeted systematic base-calling errors caused by cross-hybridization between the wholegenome sample and the array probes and by deletions in the sample DNA relative to the chip reference sequence were developed. Our approach eliminated 91% of the false-positive singlenucleotide polymorphism calls identified in the SCHU S4 query sample, at the cost of 10.7% of the true positives, yielding a total base-calling accuracy of 99.992%.",

There is an urgent need for accurate, high-resolution microbial genotyping methods, in spite of the existence of a number of widely used typing methods. That is because the current methods offer only low-resolution and limited genotyping. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), horizontal gene transfer and/or intragenic recombination are all known to lead to variations and genome plasticity in an organism. The diversity of an organism can be explicitly understood provided these events are identified and analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively at the whole-genome level.",

SNPs and other polymorphisms that serve as informative genetic characters are globally determined and therefore enable a more complete evaluation of inferred evolutionary relationships. The cumulative differences between two or more sequences provide a larger framework upon which reliable phylogenies may be established. Strain genotypes that are built upon SNP variation are highly amenable to evolutionary reconstruction and can be readily analyzed in a phylogenetic and a population genetic context to: (i) assign unknown strains into well-characterized clusters, (ii) reveal closely related siblings of a particular strain and (iii) examine the prevalence of a specific allele in a population of closely related strains that may in turn correlate with phenotypic features of the infectious agent (1) . More directly and for a variety of purposes such as forensic investigations or epidemiological investigations, SNPs provide potential markers for the purpose of strain identification.",

For example, deletions in the sample DNA relative to the reference sequence can cause poor hybridization performance, resulting in a mixture of no-calls and false-positive SNP calls in the affected regions (the low homology effect); the large population of target DNA fragments in a wholegenome sample may contain sequences capable of high-efficiency hybridization with more than one of the probe pairs, resulting in a false-positive SNP call (the alternate homology effect) and the local destabilizing effect of genuine SNPs in the sample leads to false-positive calls at adjacent genome locations (the footprint effect).",

Each queryable base position in the reference sequence (nonrepetitive sequence) was represented by eight 25 nucleotide probes or 'features' that define a locus. For each locus, four probes were designed to query the forward strand and four probes represented the reverse complementary strand. The forward and reverse probes were identical at all base positions except the central (13th) position, where the reference base and each of the three alternative bases were represented. The next locus represented probes that were shifted by one base and placed a new base in the central query position. The tiling of loci along a genome sequence effectively allowed for base calls to be derived for each base represented on the array. High confidence base calls were made by virtue of two features within each locus hybridizing with greater efficiency than alternative features (e.g. an A call on the forward strand was accompanied by a T call on the reverse strand). The Affymetrix GSEQ software assigned a quality score to each base call that combined hybridization information from both the forward and reverse strands.",

Sequences of plasmids, pOM1 (GenBank Accession: NC 002109) and pFNL10 (GenBank Accession: NC 004952), were obtained from the NCBI database (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The LVS sequence used in this study was obtained from The Microbial Genomics group, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos, prior to its submission to NCBI. This sequence differs from the submitted sequence by 13 insertions and deletions (indels, 12 single base and 1 two base), and 12 variant base calls. All but four of these differences lie in repeat regions that were excluded from our design. The remaining differences are a single base insertion in the final sequence near the start of one of the fragments (or instructions) on the array, and three single base call changes. A merged sequence was constructed based on these genomic and plasmid sequences for the purposes of GeneChip \u00d5 design. The F. tularensis LVS and SCHU S4 genomes are 1 895 998 and 1 892 819 bp, respectively. An in silico analysis was performed to identify unique sequences from SCHU S4 (ranging from 1 bp to 11 086 bp) that were appended to the LVS sequence along with plasmid pOM1 sequence and unique regions from pFNL10. There are 12 869 bp of sequences unique to LVS relative to SCHU S4 and 42 369 bp present in SCHU S4 but not LVS. In total, this analysis defined 1 943 751 bp of F. tularensis sequence. We used the MUMmer tool set (http://mummer.sourceforge.net/) and repeatFinder [based on REPuter(c) Copyright University of Bielefeld, Germany (http://www.genomes.de/)] to identify 170 356 and 139 560 bp of repetitive sequence in LVS and SCHU S4, respectively. A total of 179 193 bp. (9.22%) of repetitive sequence were excluded from the design, resulting in 1 764 558 queryable bases (91% of the F. tularensis genome) for resequencing by hybridization. A total of 1 769 695 bp were submitted for chip production by adding back 5137 bp from the immediate flanks of excluded repeats as padded bases. This sequence was tiled onto a set of six CustomSeq 300 K GeneChips \u00d5 by Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA), consisting of 14 125 688 individual probes.

It scans the base calls from the CHP files to identify regions of adjacent positions that are rich in no-calls and SNP calls. It uses a sliding-window approach, first looking at windows of 50-base length (user specified) for regions whose content of no-calls plus SNP calls comprises 60% or greater of the specified window size. Upon encountering such regions, the algorithm uses a 10-base window to examine the sequence at higher resolution, so that the proximal breakpoint of the low homology region (generally a deletion) is properly defined. The extent of the region is determined by expanding the region using a 50-base length window as far as possible. Once the region limits are determined, the algorithm uses a 10-base window to map the breakpoint of the distal end of the deletion. SNP calls that occur within the defined low-homology region are removed from the list of high-confidence SNP calls. (The coordinates of the low-homology regions themselves are also interesting, as they represent areas of the reference sequence that are not represented in the sample.)

The query DNA sample may contain sequence capable of hybridizing with high efficiency to more than one probe pair at a locus on the array. The occurrence of such sequence, referred to as the 'alternate homology effect', is illustrated in Figure 1 . The ability of the GSEQ software to make a base call at any particular locus is dependent upon the relative signal strength of the best forward and reverse probe being above a certain threshold compared with the next best signal at that locus. When a locus contains two strongly hybridizing probe pairs, the GSEQ software may make a SNP call, a reference base call or a no-call ('N'), depending on the relative signal strengths of the probe pairs. In practice, we have found that the alternate sequence need not match the probe sequence over the entire 25-base length in order to cause a spurious base call. A whole-genome DNA sample will naturally contain a larger population of distinct 25-mer sequences than a sample composed of a small subset of the genome. For this reason, the alternate homology effect is significant in the context of whole-genome hybridization. This problem led us to develop an algorithm to identify and filter out base miscalls that resulted from this phenomenon.",

Our approach to the problem of the alternate homology effect exploits this assumption. For each SNP observed in the raw results, we search for any alternate sequences within the reference sequence that could account for the SNP call. The difference in binding energy between the alternate (SNP) sequence and the reference sequence is used to differentiate between likely artifacts and genuine SNPs.

For each SNP call in the analyzed results, the SNP 25-mer probe sequence is used to search for all perfect, ungapped alignments of at least 13 bases with the LVS genome sequence. The requirement of a minimum alignment length of 13 bases guarantees that the SNP base will be included in all alignments found. The program ExamineSNPs.pl examines the SNP alignments and calculates the binding energies, using the MUMmer package to obtain the sequence alignments (11) and the binding energy calculator from the ArrayOligoSelector package (12) for the binding energy calculations. The alignment representing the highest binding energy is selected and compared with the free energy of binding of the reference 25-mer to its reverse complement. If the difference between these two binding energies is 11.5 kcal/mol, the SNP call is assumed to be an artifact of the alternate sequence homology and it is removed from the list of high-confidence SNP calls. The set of SNP calls from the hybridization of a SCHU S4 sample was used to determine the threshold binding energy difference that identifies probable alternate homology artifacts. A delta binding energy threshold of 11.5 kcal/mol was chosen based on the effect of different threshold values on the false-negative and false-positive calls ( Figure 2 ). The next filter in our pipeline is a quality filter that simply eliminates SNP calls that have been assigned low quality scores by the GSEQ software. The quality score is based on the difference in signal intensity between the highest intensity probe pair and the next highest intensity The top pair represents a sample DNA sequence perfectly matching a reference probe.

The occurrence of a real SNP in a query sample results in a destabilizing effect on 25-mers in the immediate vicinity of the SNP. This artifact, called the 'footprint effect', is illustrated in Figure 4 . The locus on the resequencing chip at which the SNP occurs contains two probes that hybridize perfectly with the sample over the entire 25-base length of the forward-and reversecomplement probes (only the forward strand is shown in the figure). However, at adjacent loci on the chip, which represent base positions near the SNP base, there are no probes that hybridize perfectly with the sample DNA. This is because, in general, the chip design tiles probes based on a single reference sequence, which does not contain the SNP base. As a result, the probes on the chip that represent reference sequence positions within 12 bases of the SNP location will all contain at least a single-base mismatch with the sample DNA. This mismatch decreases the reference probe hybridization intensities and increases the likelihood that an alternate sequence from a second location in the sample DNA will hybridize more strongly to a non-reference probe pair. This results in a mixture of reference calls, SNP calls and no-calls at the loci within 12 base positions adjacent to a genuine SNP, with reference calls predominant. This effect is exacerbated when two genuine SNPs occur within the same 25-base window. The footprint effect, like the alternate homology effect, is expected to be more pronounced in the context of a whole-genome hybridization, because of the larger number of hybridization targets in the sample.",

These results represent the approximate upper limit of the technology's performance in our hands.

Each successive filter further reduced the set of false-positive SNP calls with a cost in terms of a loss of some true-positive SNPs. The cumulative effect was a reduction of the initial false-positive set by over 98% in the case of LVS and over 91% in the case of SCHU S4, with no loss of true positives for LVS and a loss of about 10.7% of true positives for SCHU S4 after implementation of the filters.

A feature probe on the resequencing chip that spans one of these rearrangement boundaries would be expected to hybridize poorly with the SCHU S4 sample, and this increased the likelihood that alternate sequences would hybridize more strongly, increasing the false-positive calls. This outcome suggests that the resequencing platform could be used to identify The results shown are for the LVS sample, using the Affymetrix-recommended batch analysis parameters, including a quality score threshold of 12 and a call rate cutoff of 0.5.

We found that the majority of the false-positive SNP calls in the SCHU S4 sample fell into one of two categories: (i) those that lie within 12 bases of a rearrangement boundary and (ii) those that lie within 12 bases of a predicted SNP. These results are summarized in Table 5 . In spite of the larger number of false positives in the SCHU S4 data set, they represent only 2.04% of the SNP calls that remained after filtering. Table 6 shows the comparison of raw and filtered data for LVS and SCHU S4. The raw call rate and accuracy take into account all base positions on the resequencing chips and report the results prior to any filtering steps. The genome-adjusted results take into account only those portions of the chips that have high sequence homology with the hybridized sample. The data indicated a false-negative SNP rate in the range of 0-17.31% and a false-positive rate in the range of 0.001-0.007%. The falsepositive SNP rate is the number of false positives divided by the number of bases at which a genuine SNP call was not expected. The false-negative SNP rate is the number of expected SNPs that were not identified divided by the total number of expected SNPs. The false-negative rate can be misleading, since this rate includes all expected SNPs that were not detected, including those that were not in the raw data set as well as those that were removed by our filters. Although the false-negative SNP rate for the SCHU S4 sample was 17.310%, it is important to note that the filters eliminated less than 11% of the true-positive SNPs that were in the raw data set (see Table 3 ). There is an inevitable tradeoff between the rejection of false positives and the retention of true-positive SNPs. In general, an increase in the stringency of filtering will cause a reduction in both false positives and true positives. The filtering scripts can be parameterized by the user for an appropriate tradeoff between sensitivity (retention of true positives) and specificity (rejection of true negatives). Since LVS was the primary reference whose sequence is represented most fully on the chips, the results for the LVS samples were better than we would expect to achieve with a sample of unknown composition. The efficiency of the platform cannot be numerically defined as it varies according to the extent of the difference between the sample DNA and the reference sequence.",

A whole-genome sample contains a much larger complexity of targets for hybridization than does a PCR-amplified subset of the whole genome, and these additional targets give rise to some of the inaccurate base calls. The widely accepted ABACUS algorithm (4) for the Affymetrix-based resequencing platform may not perform with equal efficiency on a whole-genome query sample. It is necessary to understand the nature and source of errors in whole-genome hybridization in order to optimally use this platform. Improved base-calling algorithms and bioinformatic tools are essential to decrease false positives, minimize false negatives and increase the overall base-calling accuracy of this platform. The bioinformatic filters reported here were developed towards achieving these goals.",

These filters operate on the base calls and quality scores provided by the Affymetrix GSEQ program, yielding a set of high-confidence SNP calls containing a lower percentage of false positives. We used the set of SNPs predicted by in silico analysis for the hybridization of the SCHU S4 sample to test and fine-tune our filters.

For SCHU S4, 7464 SNPs were expected, on the basis of in silico alignment of the LVS and SCHU S4 genome sequences.

The most computationally intensive part of the filter algorithms is the identification of potential alternate homologies in the reference sequence, and the calculation of binding energies for these sequences. But this task need only be performed the first time that a particular SNP location is encountered. We store the results of these calculations in a data file, and when new experiments are processed, results for previously encountered SNP locations are looked up in this database rather than computed. Some of the issues identified in our results suggest some areas for further improvement of our filters. The presence of false-positive SNP calls that occur near rearrangement boundaries indicates that the low-homology filter did not identify all low-homology regions that could potentially be removed, and its performance could be further improved. Identifying a signature in the resequencing data that corresponds to a rearrangement boundary may allow us to filter false-positive SNPs from this source. More importantly, this boundary information itself should prove to be a valuable tool for the genotyping of different strains of an organism. The occurrence of coincident rearrangement boundaries in two different samples is strong evidence of genetic similarity and can be used in conjunction with the SNP data to draw conclusions about phylogenetic relationships.",

The footprint effect filter also had a relatively large negative impact on true positives in the SCHU S4 results (see Table 3 ). One underlying assumption of the current filter is that, within a set of closely spaced SNP calls, the one with the highest quality score is most likely to be the genuine SNP. This assumption may be violated in some cases, resulting in both false-positive and false-negative SNP calls. Another weakness of the current filter is that when two SNP calls lie within 10 base positions of each other, only one of the calls can survive the filter. Perhaps the effectiveness of this filter can be improved by examining signal intensities directly, rather than relying solely on the quality values assigned by the GSEQ software.",

Additional experiments with the recently available genome sequence of a clinical strain WY96-3418 (GenBank accession number CP000608) also support the robustness of the filter parameters chosen.
