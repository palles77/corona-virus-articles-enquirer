            "text": "Common cold, also known as acute upper respiratory infections (AURI), is the most frequently experienced disease among humans and the third most common primary diagnosis in office visits. 1 More than 200 respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus or metapneumoviros are known to cause the common cold and rhinovirus is the most common cause accounting for 30%-50% of all adult related colds. [2] [3] [4] These viruses are spread by sneezing, coughing or nose blowing. The symptoms of the common cold include fever, cough, myalgias, headache, nasal congestion, sore throat and usually peak at 2 to 3 days and have a mean duration of 7 to 10 days. 5, 6 Due to the viral mutations and self-limiting aspects of the common cold, it's difficult to make effective treatments. So treatment for common cold is directed at symptom relief rather than treating the infection. 7 Lots of attempts to treat common cold including vitamins, zinc, vaccines, garlic, corticosteroids and others were controversial or ineffective. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] In this case, more and more people start to seek for help from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a unique and well-established system of medicine. TCM treatment for common cold has unique advantages such as TCM divides colds into three categories: wind-heat syndrome, wind-cold syndrome and summer-heat dampness syndrome. Then different treatments are taken according to different categories, different seasons, and different populations. Besides, TCM treatment for common cold has stable efficacy and few side effects. What's more, TCM is more economical than chemical drugs and people are more likely to accept it. Common cold with wind-heat syndrome (CCWHS) is the most common type and primarily characterized by fever, sore throat, headache and nasal congestion. According to the theory of TCM, CCWHS should be treated by clearing heat and releasing stagnated Lung-Qi. As a pure Chinese medicine, Reduqing granules is manufactured by Zhujiang Hospital, Guangzhou Maxingshigan Tang and Yinqiao San. Lianhuaqingwen capsules has been widely used in the treatment of influenza for many years. Its efficacy on influenza by alleviating fever, cough, sore throat and fatigue has been confirmed. 17 Many studies have shown that Lianhuaqingwen capsules also has the antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. 18, 19 This trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Reduqing granules in the treatment of patients with CCWHS by analyzing total markedly effective rate, total effective rate, change in TCM symptom score, time to fever relief, time to fever clearance and adverse events in patients received either Reduqing granules or Lianhuaqingwen capsules. Reduqing granules has been widely used to treat CC-WHS clinically. However, none standardized clinical trial has been conducted to confirm its efficacy and safety. This was the first randomized clinical trial (RCT) conducted in China designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Reduqing granules in patients with CCWHS.",

[21] [22] [23] Thereafter, antiviral drugs are thought to be the most effective measures to treat colds. However, in most cases, treatment for common cold is directed at symptoms relief rather than treating the infection for the viral mutations, self-limiting aspects of the common cold, limitations to antiviral drugs such as viral resistance in some patients and so on. Lots of attempts to treat common cold were controversial and many uncertainties remain when it comes to prevent and treat the common cold. Such as antihistamines may slightly reduce local symptoms of common cold, but the overall effects were small. 24 Antihistamines as mono therapy were almost ineffective in the treatment of common cold. Decongestants may relieve nasal symptoms, but its clinical significance were still uncertain. [25] [26] [27] Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were effective in relieving pain and fever in people with common cold, but ineffective in relieving other symptoms. 28 Antibiotics is not useful given the viral etiology of the disease. In this case, the possible availability of an effective and safe treatment could be a useful treatment and TCM is a good choice. TCM has been widely used to treat CCWHS in China. However, the available evidence of the clinical efficacy of these formulas is inadequate. This randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel, positive-controlled trial demonstrated that Reduqing granules is effective and safe in the treatment of common cold with wind-heat syndrome. All the symptoms were relief after the four-day treatment of Reduqing granules as expected. There were no statistically significant differences in total markedly effective rate and total effective rate between Reduqing group and Lianhuaqingwen group, just as change in TCM symptom score, time to fever relief and time to fever clearance. What's more, no-drug related serious adverse events were reported during the trial. Oral Lianhuaqingwen capsules and Reduqing granules were all well tolerated. Lianhuaqingwen capsule was selected to be positive-controlled medicine in this trial. This was due to the reason that Lianhuaqingwen capsules had proved to be effective in the treatment of common cold by standard clinical trials. 17 What's more, a systematic review demonstrated that Lianhuaqingwen capsule was more effective than other TCM and western drugs in alleviating flu-like symptoms when treating influenza. 29 Besides, Lianhuaqingwen capsules, which has been listed, has similar indications with Reduqing granules. Since the difference of the packaging of Lianhuaqingwen capsules and Reduqing granules cannot be overcome, a double-blind, double-dummy trial was conducted. The combination of study drugs, controlled drugs and relevant dummy drugs were identical in shape, size, color and smell. Besides, both the participants and the clinical pharmacist were blinded to the treatment, which guaranteed the validity of the trial. CCWHS is the most common type. According to TCM therapy, CCWHS should be treated by clearing heat and releasing stagnated Lung-Qi. Reduqing granules, manufactured by Zhujiang Hospital, has been widely used in the treatment of CCWHS clinically. It is composed of fifteen herbs include Daqingye (Folium Isatidis), Lianqiao (Fructus Forsythiae Suspensae) and so on. Given the multiple composition of Reduqing granules, it's not possible to attribute its efficacy in the treatment of CCWHS to a single ingredient. The contribution of the 15 ingredients is not known. The exact mechanism of each herb is also unknown. As a result, more studies are needed to explore the mechanisms of action and properties of the identified components. This study had some potential limitations. Firstly, this trial was conducted with a small sample size that only 72 participants were involved in the trial, although none was lost or withdrew from the trial. Secondly, the duration of treatment and follow-up was comparatively short, the symptoms of some patients were not resolved completely at the end of study. At last, considering self-limiting aspects of the common cold, a placebo group should have been set, but our study did not. Given above, the conclusion in this trial is not representative. Large scale trials with careful design are needed to objectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of Reduqing granules in CCWHS in the future.",
