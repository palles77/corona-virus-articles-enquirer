Dated estimates suggest that viruses may cause 5 -32% of all nosocomial infections in the United States. 6 In fact, ongoing changes in our societies, 7 healthcare policies and practices in modern hospitals enhance our susceptibility and exposure to many types of pathogens including viruses. Whereas complete elimination of the transmission of viruses may not be attainable, proper and judicious use of microbicides has the potential to halt the spread of many such pathogens in hospitals and elsewhere. This aspect will be addressed here with particular emphasis on the activity of microbicides against surrogates for two types of nosocomial viral pathogens, namely, noroviruses and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus.",

Many types of viruses can remain viable for several hours on hands and, generally, much longer on environmental surfaces. 8 Infectious virus particles have been isolated from naturally contaminated hands of caregivers and fomites. 5 Since hands can donate or receive viruses during casual contact with animate and inanimate surfaces, 9 proper and regular decontamination of hands by caregivers is crucial in preventing and controlling the spread of viral and other types of pathogen. Evidence from experimental as well as epidemiological studies indicates that environmental surfaces may also play a role in the nosocomial spread of respiratory and enteric nosocomial viral pathogens. 8 The capacity of a given virus to spread from hostto-host is determined by, among other things, its ability to remain viable during transit to the susceptible host. Virus shedding generally begins prior to the onset of clinical symptoms and lasts for several days after recovery; chronic cases of hepatitis B, for example, can be life-long sources of the virus. The actual amount of virus discharge varies considerably depending on the type of infecting agent and the stage of the infection.",

            "text": "The extent of virus survival on a surface or object is the key to its potential to act as a source of the virus. The most important contribution to survival is perhaps the protection afforded to the virus by the fluid in which it is discharged. Virus survival in the environment in general is inversely proportional to air temperature. Relative humidity (RH) also has a pronounced effect on virus survival and its effect is modulated by air temperature: Enveloped viruses usually survive better in dryer conditions and lower RH than can be tolerated by non-enveloped viruses. 8, 10 Virus transfer from contaminated to clean surfaces Apart from direct contamination, both animate and inanimate surfaces can become contaminated indirectly through transfer of virus from other vehicles ( Figure 1 ). Of these, deposition by settling of virus-containing aerosols or contact with contaminated fluids are obvious. Less obvious are the transfers, which may occur between different types of surfaces. Our laboratory-based studies on rotavirus transfer between animate-inanimate, animate-animate and inanimate-animate surfaces have shown that virus transfer: (a) readily occurs irrespective of the nature of donor and recipient surfaces, (b) was reduced with increase in the age of the inoculum, most likely due to greater loss of moisture, (c) was directly proportional to the amount of pressure applied during contact and (d) increased substantially when friction was applied during contact. 11 Interrupting the spread of viruses Figure 2 illustrates the many applications of microbicides in hospitals for controlling the environmental spread of pathogens including viruses. The use of such chemicals in infection control in general operates on the basic premise that the risk of acquiring a given infection is directly proportional to the amount of its causative agent in the vicinity and that proper use of microbicides lowers this risk by reducing the pathogen load. Microbicides can also interrupt pathogen transfer from contaminated to clean surfaces. In hospitals, viruses which lend themselves to interruption by proper microbicide use are those which spread mainly through hands, fomites, medical devices, and environmental surfaces.",

Viruses discharged by them could cause serious disease in others, particularly those who are debilitated due to immunosuppression or other causes. Most hospitals have a pool of such highly susceptible individuals. Insufficient numbers of or inconvenient location of sinks and a lack of availability of skinfriendly products discourage compliance with handwashing by caregivers. While the use of nonaqueous liquids and gels for hygienic hand antisepsis has been a long-accepted practice in Europe, 12, 13 such formulations are now meeting with increasing acceptance in North America as well. 25 The use of such products has the potential to reduce handborne spread of viruses. 14 Virus transfer from contaminated to clean surfaces can be interrupted through the use of microbicides. 15 However, not all products are equally effective in this respect. In fact, the use of an ineffective product with a good surfactant can dislodge the virus from the surfaces without killing it, thus making it more readily available for transfer upon contact. In other words, the use of certain formulations for the decontamination of environmental surfaces may inadvertently enhance their potential in the direct or indirect spread of viruses.",

However, earlier studies with another human coronaviruses (229E) have found it to be somewhat more resistant to microbicides when compared to a human parainfluenzavirus. 21 In these tests, 10 mL of the virus was suspended in mucin to give a final mucin concentration of 5 mg/mL. Each carrier (stainless steel disks of 1 cm diameter) with the dried virus inoculum was covered with 20 mL of test microbicide for 1 min at room temperature. The eluates were plaque assayed in L-132 cells and the arbitrary virucidal effectiveness criterion was a log 10 reduction factor of $ 3 in virus infectivity. Table II summarizes the data on coronavirucidal activity from the study. 21 In spite of the fact that 229E is an enveloped virus, quaternary ammonium compound and a phenolic were unable to meet the product performance criterion in these tests. A 0.01% solution of domestic bleach (, 100 ppm available chlorine) also failed to achieve the desired level of virus inactivation. It should be noted that the contact time in these experiments was one minute, which more closely simulates the application of microbicides in the decontamination of environmental surfaces.
