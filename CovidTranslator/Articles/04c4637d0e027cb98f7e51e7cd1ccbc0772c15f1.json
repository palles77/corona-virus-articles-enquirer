            "text": "The demand among veterinarians that vaccines be simple to administer and timesaving has led to the long-term and widespread use of polyvalent vaccines. Twenty-five years ago, the most commonly used polyvalent products contained three vaccines (distemper-hepatitis-leptospirosis). Today, products containing eight or more vaccines per dose are routinely administered to dogs. Furthermore, polyvalent vaccines are routinely administered annually with seemingly little regard for the actual risk of infection. This is a disturbing trend. Annual administration of polyvalent vaccine implies that each vaccine antigen, whether of bacterial or viral origin, in each polyvalent product induces the same degree of immunity for the same duration in every patient. Immunologically, this is irrational. Depending on the vaccine and based on the results of controlled challenge studies, dogs derive protective immunity that persists for as little as a few months to as long as 7 or more years. 2 , 4,7,14,18,20,25,29,30 Convenience rather than science seems to be the driving force behind conventional recommendations listed on vaccine \"labels\" (product inserts).

Considering the low (to absent) prevalence, the risk of \"hepatitis blue-eye\" reactions and the fact that CAV-2 cross-protects against CAV-l, use of vaccines containing this antigen is not recommended for use in routine vaccination protocols.",

Attenuated (MLV) adenovirus vaccines are generally used in the United States because of their ability to produce a superior immune response, but inactivated products are still available in the U.S. and marketed in many countries. Vaccination for ICH reduced the prevalence of a disease that was once widespread. Outbreaks or isolated cases still occur when vaccination of puppies is delayed or incomplete. Shedding of modified viruses and high stability outside the host have been responsible for inadvertent immunization of many dogs. Vaccines for ICH contain either a killed homologous canine adenovirus-l (CAV-l) or a closely related respiratory isolate, MLV canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2). The former is generally shed in the urine, and the latter is shed in upper respiratory secretions; however, the amount that is shed varies between individual products. Another side effect of attenuated CAV-l vaccine is its ability to produce anterior uveitis and corneal edema with opacification (\"blue eye\") in a small percentage of dogs. It is not documented that CAV-2 vaccines cause uveitis. Although inactivated vaccines produce a lesser serologic response, they are not shed by the host, nor do they cause anterior uveitis.

MLV products offer faster, more effective protection against disease and shedding of virulent virus after challenge than inactivated vaccines. For this reason, older dogs that are housed with younger susceptible animals should be vaccinated with MLV vaccines. In case of an outbreak, MLV vaccines should always be used. MLV CPV-2 products are consistently shed in the feces of vaccinated dogs. Infected contact animals may develop weak positive reactions on fecal parvovirus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests but will not develop disease. Maternal antibody blockade is the predominant reason that parvoviral vaccination is inconsistent in protecting pups during their primary vaccination series.1O,16 Attenuated or inactivated vaccines do not break through maternal immunity as effectively as virulent canine parvovirus. To overcome the period of maternal antibody blockade, manufacturers have raised the titers or lowered their serial passage. 8 ,28.29 Recommendations for use of these potent parvoviral vaccines are a complete series beginning at 6 weeks of age. Repeat vaccines are given every 3 to 4 weeks until dogs are 16 weeks old despite the fact that some products have label claims of protection by 12 weeks of age. The last inoculation should be given at 16 weeks of age for breeds such as Doberman Pinschers and Rottweilers, which have been identified as being poorly responsive to CPV vaccination. In the absence of maternal immunity, where pups are presented after 16 weeks of age, one MLV CPV-2 inoculation may be sufficient for protection against parvoviral infection. Vaccination with MLV CDV with concurrent CPV-2 vaccination does not cause immunosuppression as has been observed in coinfection with virulent CPV-2 virus.

Furthermore, manufacturer recommendations to administer CCV booster vaccines annually are difficult to justify based on the fact that CCV does not cause disease in adult dogs. CCV produces significantly less morbidity and minimal mortality compared with CPV-2. Experimentally, combined infections with CPV-2 and CCV have been shown to produce clinical disease that is more severe than with either infection alone. 1 Nevertheless, it has also been shown that vaccination with CPV can prevent clinical disease when both viruses are present.1 9 ,28 The routine and frequent use of CCV vaccine in dogs is difficult to rationalize. Clinical infection typically occurs in puppies 6 weeks of age or younger. Some studies have suggested that the duration and quality of immunity derived from natural exposure and infection are actually preferred over attempts to immunize by way of vaccination. 28 In the absence of reliable commercial or in-hospital diagnostic assays for CCV, the prevalence of clinical disease associated with CCV infection in dogs is unknown but is considered to be extremely low, even in high-density shelter environments. Yet CCV, both killed and MLV, is commercially incorporated into several multivalent vaccines combined with distemper, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and parvovirus antigens. The fact that multivalent vaccines containing CCV outsell vaccines that do not contain CCV in the United States suggests that routine CCV inoculation of dogs throughout life is common. CCV vaccine is considered to be among the least important vaccine antigens given to dogs today, however, and has been identified by several authors as a vaccine that, quite simply, is not needed. 9 ,28",

Vaccination with these products is not recommended in animals less than 9 weeks of age because of the allergenic nature of these products. Leptospira bacterin is usually used to reconstitute the lyophilized components in combination vaccines. Leptospira bacterins may not produce as high a level or as long a duration of immunity as other agents. Although postvaccination titers often decline to undetectable levels, unpublished challenge studies suggest that immu-nity in some dogs is sustained for 1 year. Inactivated Leptospira vaccines may not, however, protect against the carrier state that may develop after exposure to virulent organisms. One vaccine manufacturer has employed a technology that involves separating surface proteins, or immunogens, of Leptospira from extraneous cellular debris, thereby avoiding the need to use whole-cell bacteria. It is not known whether or not this technology can reduce the incidence of adverse events in young dogs and toy breeds over that recognized with conventional wholecell bacterins. Leptospiral vaccines have been considered optional by veterinarians in many areas because of the perceived low incidence of the disease, short duration of immunity, and risk of postvaccinal hypersensitivity. The use of Leptospira vaccine is probably responsible for the reduced prevalence of disease caused by L. canicola and L. icterohaemorrhagiae.",

Serovars of L. grippotyphosa, L. pomona, L. bratislava, and others are reported throughout the United States and have been linked to acute renal failure. 6 ,33 Another interesting point is that many of these reports are on dogs living exclusively in urban areas. The risk of infection is not limited to dogs living outdoors in rural environments. Vaccines containing conventionally used serovars of L. canicola and L. icterohaemorrhagiae do not cross-protect against other serovars known to infect dogs. s Less than 2 years ago, Leptospira vaccines were introduced that are believed to protect against serovars L. grippotyphosa and L. pomona. Additional Leptospira serovars are likely to be introduced in the near future. Nevertheless, the incidence of acute anaphylaxis among young dogs (especially those under 12 weeks of age) and toy breeds (regardless of age) makes the decision to include routine vaccination of dogs with all available Leptospira serovars difficult. Without regional incidence data for canine leptospirosis, practitioners still have insufficient information at their disposal to make a reasonable riskbenefit analysis regarding use of leptospira vaccines.",
