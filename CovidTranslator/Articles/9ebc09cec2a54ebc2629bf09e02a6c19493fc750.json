            "text": "CoV. The infection of SARS-CoV is mediated mainly through the viral surface glycoproteins, which consist of S1 and S2 subunits and form trimer spikes on the envelope of the virions. Here we report the ectodomain structures of the SARS-CoV surface spike trimer in different conformational states determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The conformation 1 determined at 4.3 \u00c5 resolution is three-fold symmetric and has all the three receptor-binding C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1s) of the S1 subunits in \"down\" positions. The binding of the \"down\" CTD1s to the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is not possible due to steric clashes, suggesting that the conformation 1 represents a receptor-binding inactive state. Conformations 2-4 determined at 7.3, 5.7 and 6.8 \u00c5 resolutions are all asymmetric, in which one RBD rotates away from the \"down\" position by different angles to an \"up\" position. The \"up\" CTD1 exposes the receptor-binding site for ACE2 engagement, suggesting that the conformations 2-4 represent a receptor-binding active state. This conformational change is also required for the binding of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies targeting the CTD1. This phenomenon could be extended to other betacoronaviruses utilizing CTD1 of the S1 subunit for receptor binding, which provides new insights into the intermediate states of coronavirus pre-fusion spike trimer during infection.",

Currently, six coronavirus strains that are able to infect humans have been identified. Among them, alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 and lineage A betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 usually cause mild and self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection [1] . In 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a lineage B betacoronavirus, was identified and infected more than 8 000 persons including nearly 800 related deaths worldwide in the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic [2] [3] [4] . Ten years later, another highly pathogenic lineage C betacoronavirus named the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [5, 6] . Since its discovery, the MERS-CoV has infected 1 800 persons including 640 related deaths according to the WHO data in August, 2016. These two deadly coronaviruses have been extensively studied in epidemiology, virology, clinical features and other aspects [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, there are still no approved antiviral drugs and vaccines to treat and prevent the infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "The spike (S) glycoprotein on the coronavirus envelope is responsible for host cell attachment, receptor binding, and for mediating host cell membrane and viral membrane fusion during infection. It is synthesized as a precursor single polypeptide chain of ~1 300 amino acids and then cleaved by host furin-like proteases into an amino (N)-terminal S1 subunit and a carboxyl (C)-terminal S2 subunit [7, 11] . The S1 subunit contains domains for host cell attachment by recognizing cell surface sugar molecules and binding to specific cellular receptors [12, 13] . Therefore, the S1 subunit, especially its receptor-binding domain (RBD) is critical in determining cell tropism, host range and zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses [14, 15] . The S2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion loop and two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2), which suggest a coiled helix structure of the S2 subunit [7] . Previous studies suggested that three S monomers assemble to form homo-trimer spikes anchoring on the outmost viral envelope [16] . Binding of RBD to cellular receptors triggers conformational changes in the S1 and S2 subunits, leading to the exposure of the fusion loop and its insertion into target cell membrane [17] . The HR1 and HR2 regions in the S glycoprotein trimer then form a six-helix bundle fusion core that bridges the viral and host cell membranes into close apposition to facilitate fusion [17] . For the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the RBD in the S1 subunit and the post-fusion core in the S2 subunit have been structurally and functionally studied as separate domains [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . A previous study of the SARS-CoV virions by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reported the structure of the S glycoprotein trimers on the virion at a low resolution of 16.0 \u00c5 [16] . Recently the pre-fusion structures of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronaviruses HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein trimers were determined by cryo-EM at 4.0, 4.0 and 3.4 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively [24] [25] [26] . However, high-resolution structures of the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S glycoprotein trimers are still missing. In addition, intermediate states of the coronavirus S glycoprotein trimer are also required for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying receptor binding and membrane fusion.",

The purified SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was subjected to cryo-EM structural analysis using an FEI Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron counting camera (Supplementary information, Figure S1A ). Projected secondary structure features were clearly visible in the 2D classification analysis of the boxed particles (Supplementary information, Figure  S1B ). After 3D classification and refinement, four major different conformational states (conformations 1-4) were determined (Supplementary information, Figure S2A ). The SARS-CoV spike has an overall mushroom-like shape. One of the conformation states is closely threefold symmetric, whereas the other three conformation states show significant asymmetric features in the mushroom head region.

The CTD1 functions as the RBD of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, which specifically binds to the cellular receptor ACE2 [18, 28] . The CTD1 is immediately followed by the CTD2 and CTD3, and the NTD is connected to the CTD1 through a long linker (residues 295-319; Figure 1A and 1B). The NTDs of MHV and HKU1 S glycoproteins are structurally similar and both adopt a galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich fold. The model to map correlation values are 0.86 for the MHV NTD and 0.87 for the HKU1 NTD (Supplementary information, Figure S4A and S4B). Fitting of the MHV or HKU1 NTD structure into the corresponding SARS-CoV S glycoprotein density map gave relatively low resolution to map correlation values (0.55 for MHV NTD and 0.52 for HKU1 NTD; Supplementary information, Figure S4C and S4D), indicating that the SARS-CoV NTD has different local conformations, although it may still adopt the galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich fold. The relatively low resolution in this region also did not allow us to perform ab initio model building of the NTD, therefore only two strands and a short \u03b1-helix were built and residues 14-260 were not included in the atomic model ( Figure 1A and 1B). The \u03b1-helix-rich S2 subunit begins after the S1/S2 cleavage site at residue 667 ( Figure 1A ). The atomic model of the S2 subunit includes the functionally important fusion peptide (residues 798-815) and HR1 (residues 880-967; Figure 1A and 1B). The C-terminal HR2 (residues 1 154-1 183) was not built due to relatively poor density in this region ( Figure 1A and 1B).",

In the symmetric conformation 1, the CTD1s in the head are all in a \"down\" position, covering the S2 subunits in the stem (Figure 2A ). The angle between the long axis of the CTD1 and its projection on the horizontal plane perpendicular to the 3-fold axis is ~19 degree (Figure 2A ). In the conformations 2-4, two CTD1s still adopt the same \"down\" conformation as in the conformation 1, whereas one CTD1 rotates outward to an \"up\" position and no longer covers the S2 subunit ( Figure 2B-2D) . The angles between the long axes of the \"up\" CTD1s and their projections on the horizontal plane have increased to 52, 64 and 70 degrees, respectively ( Figure 2B-2D ). Of note, the NTD and CTD2 around the rotated CTD1 do not have significant conformational changes (Supplementary information, Figure S5A ). Therefore, the rotation of the CTD1 is a hinge motion around the loops connecting NTD to CTD1 and CTD1 to CTD2 that are in close proximity (Supplementary information, Figure S5B and S5C), suggesting that these two loops would play key roles in the conformational switch between the \"down\" and \"up\" positions of CTD1. Although the position of the CTD2 is not affected within the monomer where the CTD1 adopts an \"up\" conformation, the CTD2 may become more liable to undergo conformational changes to expose the fusion loop underneath.",

For conformation 1 in which all CTD1s are in the \"down\" positions, numerous steric clashes were observed between ACE2 and the neighboring CTD1, and the volume of the steric clashes reaches 10 696 \u00c5 3 ( Figure 3B and 3C) . Therefore, the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer with all its CTD1s in the \"down\" positions would not be able to bind the cellular receptor ACE2, suggesting that the three-fold symmetric conformation 1 represents a receptor-binding inactive state of the spike. In contrast, similar structural superimpositions showed that ACE2 binds the \"up\" CTD1 well without steric clashes with other regions of the S glycoprotein trimer ( Figure 3D -3F, Supplementary information, Figure S6A and S6B), suggesting that spikes with one CTD1 in the \"up\" position are able to bind receptor ACE2 and asymmetric conformations 2-4 represent a receptor-binding activate state of the spike. Notably, the \"up\" position of the CTD1 also exposes one of the covered S2 subunits, leaving the space for the large-scale conformational change of the S2 subunit to expose and insert the fusion peptide into the target cell membrane.",

Recently reported cryo-EM structures of the MHV and HKU1 S glycoprotein trimers are simi- lar to the conformation 1 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer in the receptor-binding inactive state, in which all three CTD1s in the S1 subunit are in \"down\" positions (Figure 2A) . The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer conformations 2-4 in the receptor-binding active state ( Figure 2B-2D) , in which one CTD1 is in an \"up\" position, were not observed in the MHV and HKU1 S gly-coprotein trimers. The protein receptor of the HKU1 has not been identified and the NTD in the S1 subunit was shown to bind O-acetylated sialic acids on host cells [32] . The RBD of MHV S glycoprotein is the NTD of the S1 subunit, and structural alignment revealed that the MHV protein receptor CEACAM1a binds to the NTD in the S glycoprotein trimer without steric clashes (Supplementary information, Figure S6C ) [33] . Therefore, the MHV and HKU1 S glycoprotein trimer may not need the prerequisite receptor-binding inactive to active state transition for receptor binding. This intrinsic receptor-binding difference among these coronavirus S glycoprotein trimers may be one of the reasons why the previous studies were not able to reveal other conformations rather than conformation 1 in the MHV and HKU1 S glycoprotein trimers. Nevertheless, the conformational change of CTD1 may still be needed for the subsequent exposure and conformational changes of the S2 subunit for membrane fusion during the infection of MHV and HKU1.",

Structural superimposition of DPP4 complexed with the CTD1 of MERS-CoV or HKU4 onto the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein trimer also showed that the \"up\" conformation of CTD1 is required for the binding of DPP4 by these two betacoronaviruses (Supplementary information, Figure S7 ). Therefore, we suggest that the receptor-binding inactive to active state transition observed in the SARS-CoV spike would also occur in the spikes of other betacoronaviruses that bind to their host receptors through the CTD1. In receptor-binding inactive state, all three CTD1s in the \"down\" positions would not allow efficient binding to receptors ( Figure 5) . The transition of one CTD1 from \"down\" to \"up\" position would release the steric clashes and enable the binding of one receptor molecule ( Figure 5 ). Whether the binding of the first receptor molecule is enough, or the binding of the second and third receptors is required to trigger conformational changes in the S1 and S2 subunit necessary for membrane fusion will be an interesting question for future studies.",

Sequence alignment of the SARS-CoV S and the fitted structures was performed using DNAman (Lynnon Corporation, Quebec, Canada) and ClustalX [44] . The fitted model was rebuilt using RosettaCM with C3 symmetry imposed and the best output model was selected according to the energy and fitness of the model to the EM density map [45] . The model of CTD2, CTD3 and S2 region was refined using RosettaRelax and PHENIX real-space refinement [46, 47] . The crystal structure of the CTD1 domain was fitted into the EM density and was refined as a rigid body in real space by using PHENIX. Then the two models were merged, manually adjusted in COOT and refined in PHENIX again with reference model restrains, secondary structure restrains and geometry restrains [48] . Cross-validation of overfitting was performed following the procedures described before [49, 50] . Briefly, the atom coordinates of the model (including CTD1, CTD2, CTD3 and S2) were randomly displaced by 0.5 \u00c5 using PHENIX PDB tools. Then the displaced model was refined against one of the two half maps in reciprocal space by using PHENIX. FSC curves were calculated between the refined model and the corresponding half map that was used for the refinement (half1, FSC work ) and between the refined model and the other half map (half2, FSC test ) that was not used for the model refinement. No big gaps were observed between the work and test FSC curves (Supplementary information, Figure S1D) , indicating that the model was not overfitted. Molprobity was used to evaluate the final refined model.",

To calculate the \"up\" angles of the CTD1s (Figure 2) , the horizontal plane of the S perpendicular to the 3-fold axis and the long axis of the CTD1 were generated using the UCSF Chimera \"define\" command and then the angle between the axis and the plane was calculated using the UCSF Chimera \"angle\" command. The overlap volumes between the fitted receptor and the S spike were also calculated using UCSF Chimera. Two atoms were considered to be overlapped if their overlap score > 0. The overlap score is defined as the sum of two VDW (van der Waals) radii minus the distance between them and minus an allowance (0.4 \u00c5) for potentially hydrogen-bonded pairs. All the overlap atoms were used for the generation of the steric clash area. The volume of the steric clashes was calculated using UCSF Chimera \"measure volume\" command.
