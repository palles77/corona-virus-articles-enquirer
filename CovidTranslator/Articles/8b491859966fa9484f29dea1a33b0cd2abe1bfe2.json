Competitive binding assays with these MAbs revealed the presence of at least seven distinct antigenic determinants (epitopes) on the G protein. In some cases, overlappings among epitopes to various degrees were observed as partial inhibition or binding enhancement. The MAbs to all the epitopes but one (epitopes 1-6) reacted with the denatured G protein in a Western immunoblot analysis. Four of the epitopes (epitopes 2, 4, 5, and 7) were involved in neutralization and two (epitopes 1 and 2) in hemagglutination inhibition. None of the MAbs inhibited the adsorption of radiolabeled VSV to BHK-21 cells; the MAbs to epitope 2 slightly enhanced the virus adsorption. All neutralization epitopes except epitope 2 (epitopes 4, 5, and 7) were associated with inhibition of VSVmediated cell fusion. These results show a direct spatial relationship between the epitopes recognized by the MAbs and functional sites on G protein and further insights into the structure and function of G protein.",

The glycoprotein (G) of VSV is the sole protein anchored in the viral envelope and plays a critical role in this early stage of virus infection. Many biological properties of G protein are associated with the virus entry [37] , which include adsorption to host cells [3, 6] , hemagglutination (HA) [9, 23] , and mediation of in vitro cell-cell fusion [7, 38] . The cell-cell fusion occurs only at low pH, which mimics the acidic environment of the endosomal lumen [7, 38] . As expected from its central role in infection, the G protein also gives rise to and reacts with neutralizing antibodies [12] . In recent years, much effort has been made to reveal the structurefunction relationships of the G protein, especially regarding its role in fusion [2, 10, 27, 29, 39, 40] , but the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood.",

Virus harvested at 22 h postinfection was concentrated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation [22, 25] , and purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation [22] . This preparation containing 1.1 mg/ml of viral protein (2.3 x 1011PFU/ml) was stored at -80 \u00b0C. The protein content of the preparation was determined with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL, U.S.A.) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Virus infectivity was determined by plaquing on monolayer cultures of BHK-21 cells [41] .",

This indicates that the sites involved in HA activity are different from those involved on the other functions. In general, viral HA is equivalent to the viral attachment to cells. However, the HI MAbs did not inhibit the VSV binding to BHK-21 cells. The little correlation between these two activities is likely ascribed to the difference of the target cells and/or conditions in these assays. \"l;he result of another experiment showed that the HI MAbs markedly inhibit the binding of radiolabeled VSV to goose erythrocytes, in which the binding is measured under the same condition as the HI assay (data not shown).",

The lack of the complete inhibition suggests that all neutralizing MAbs prepared in this study block the virus infection at a step subsequent to adsorption. On the other hand, a certain concentration of MAbs to Ep2, one of the neutralization epitopes, rather enhanced VSV adsorption. Although it is difficult to explain the biological significance of this enhancing effect, a similar enhancement of the VSV adsorption by immune serum was reported by Schlegel and Wade [32] .

            "text": "In the fusion inhibition assay, MAbs reacting with three epitopes (Ep 4, Ep 5, and Ep 7) inhibited the VSV-mediated cell fusion. These epitopes are probably located on or close to the fusogenic domain of G protein. Although hydrophobic domains involved in fusion have been identified in several viral fusion proteins [10, 27] , such a domain has not been identified in G protein of VSV [27] . A most recent finding that introduction of a glycosylation site into residue 117 of G protein resulted in fusion-defective mutant suggests that the residues 118 to 136 are involved in the fusion activity [39] . Some of our fusion-inhibiting MAbs may recognize these residues and the location of the fusion-inhibition epitopes will be required. We found the presence of multiple epitopes related to the fusion activity. This suggests that these different regions of G protein contribute to the fusion activity in partnership and might explain the lack of highly hydrophobic fusion sequence in the G protein of VSV. All fusion-inhibiting MAbs had the neutralizing activity. In the VSV infection process, after endocytosis of the b o u n d virion, the fusion of viral envelope with the endosomal m e m b r a n e is necessary for the entry of the nucleocapsids into the cytoplasm [20, 21] . Fusion-inhibiting MAbs neutralize VSV probably by blocking the fusion stage of the infection process.",

Purified radiolabeled virions(33,500cpm  of VSV corresponding to 2.2 ~tg) were incubated with various concentrations of the purified MAbs for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, chilled, and then plated on BHK-21 cells in 12-well plates. After exposure of the cells to the virus-MAb mixture for 1 h on ice, the cells were washed, and the cell-bound radioactivity was measured. The average counts of the duplicate wells are expressed in percentage of those in the absence of MAb. Approximately 22% of the input radioactivity remained cell-bound in the MAbfree control wells. Results with a Ep 1, b Ep 2, e Ep 3, d Ep 4, e Ep 5, f Ep 6, and g Ep 7 are shown, h Results with monoclonal mouse Ig G1 and Ig G2a used as controls well as control Ig G1 and Ig G2 a(Fig. 3 m and n), did not inhibit the polykaryocyte formation at all.DiscussionIn this paper, we prepared thirteen M A b s specifically recognizing seven distinct epitopes on G protein of VSV-Indiana and identified the epitopes involved in neutralization, HA, viral adsorption, and mediation of cell fusion by measuring the effects of each M A b on these biological functions.
