Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 1 there has been a growing recognition of the need for an integrated preparedness approach to deal with public health threats, to include acute clinical care, public health, and emergency management systems. 2 Preparing for health threats is particularly important in primary care -the first point of contact for patients entering the healthcare system.",

This framework consists of four functional domains that include clinical care, the internal and macro-environment of the primary care/general practice, and the public health responsibilities of doctors. These functional domains were first identified by the authors through a review of the peer reviewed and gray literature that included strategies relevant to general practice at the time of an influenza pandemic, and the framework was later validated through interviews with general practitioners and practice nurses and senior decision-makers. It was subsequently used to evaluate 89 publicly available jurisdictional plans in five countries. 3 Since the provision of primary care is organized differently in different countries, studying how each primary care system responds to a pandemic may generate transferable learning for other primary care systems.",

These include: (1) changes in clinical services and clinical care for influenza; (2) changes in the internal environment of primary care practice such as preventive behaviors of doctors, including hand washing and wearing a mask; (3) changes in the macro-environment of primary care practice such as the use of guidelines, training, or measures; (4) public health responsibilities such as in primary care; and (5) the impact of influenza A on quality of life, assessed using three questions: ''Has influenza affected the quality of your life?'', ''Did you feel depressed in the past 2 weeks?'', and ''Did you feel emotionally stressed in the past 2 weeks?''. The questionnaire had a multiple choice design and the respondents could tick one or more of the alternatives. Moreover, the primary care practitioners were asked about whether they would be willing to be vaccinated when a vaccine was available. The survey also included questions on demographics such as age and sex, as well as educational background, postgraduate qualifications, and the type of clinic the doctor worked in. A sample of the questionnaire is provided as Supplementary Material. The questionnaire was piloted on 30 primary care practitioners before the actual distribution, and modifications were made as a result of the comments and suggestions received from the primary doctors.",

These findings were further confirmed by the data from our qualitative study. Moreover, the additional reason of thinking that they had already been infected with influenza A H1N1 might have further reduced the willingness to accept the influenza A H1N1 vaccination. These findings among doctors in our study are similar to those recently reported in Hong Kong among hospital healthcare workers, which showed community nurses having the lowest willingness to accept vaccination. 11 Starting in 2010, all seasonal influenza vaccines have included the swine flu component. Whether this will help to ease some fear is unknown. Of note, current available surveillance data suggest no increase in adverse events with swine flu vaccines compared to seasonal flu vaccines. 12 Acceptability of pandemic influenza vaccination was found to be higher in studies conducted in general practice in France and the Netherlands, at 60% and 80%, respectively. 6,7 Similar to findings from previous studies on the same issue, the major concerns for both nurses and doctors with respect to influenza A H1N1 vaccination were fear of side effects and concerns regarding the efficacy of the new vaccine. 6, 7, [11] [12] [13] [14] Annual vaccination against influenza has been considered to be the best way to reduce sickness and death from influenza in high-risk populations, to reduce absenteeism from work in healthy adults, and to minimize healthcare-associated transmission of influenza. [15] [16] [17] With respect to the use of guidelines in dealing with pandemic influenza and the need for further training and education for dealing with pandemic influenza, we found that more than half of the doctors who worked in public clinics were likely to use guidelines (71%), but at the same time wanted to have more training on how to deal with pandemic influenza (62%). The high proportion of public doctor respondents who reported using guidelines could likely be due to the use of an intranet within large organizations, or more standardized behavior among employees in the same organization, although this is not supported by findings from our community nurses. Despite the reported use of guidelines by healthcare workers, a significant proportion continued to state the need for more training in dealing with influenza A H1N1.",
