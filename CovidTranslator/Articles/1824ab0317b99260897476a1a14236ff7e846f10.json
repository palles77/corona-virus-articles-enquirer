This assumption underestimated the infinite capacity of infectious agents for genomic variation, enabling them to develop antimicrobial resistance and exploit new opportunities to spread infections which are created when host defenses become compromised. The following are currently the most important factors influencing the presentation of infectious diseases: \u2022 The increased mobility of the world's population through tourism, immigration and inter national commerce has distorted natural geographic boundaries to infection, exposing weaknesses in host defenses, and in knowledge. \u2022 Immunodeficiency states occurring either as part of an infection, e.g. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or as an iatrogenic disease. As treatment becomes more aggressive, depression of the host's immunity occurs, enabling organisms of low virulence to become life-threatening, and may allow latent infections, accrued throughout life, to reactivate and spread. \u2022 Emerging, re-emerging and antibiotic-resistant organisms such as the tubercle bacillus and staphylococcus are a constant and growing threat. \u2022 Adaptive mutation occurring in microorganisms allows them to jump species barriers and exploit new physical environments. Such adaptation allows infections to evade host defenses and resist agents of treatment. \u2022 Bioterrorism has become an increasing concern.",

Other infectious agents are poorly visualized by routine stains and require special techniques to demonstrate their presence. This may be due to the small size of the organism, as in the case of viruses, where electron microscopy is needed. Alternatively, the organism may be hydrophobic or weakly charged, as with mycobacteria, spirochetes and cryptococci, in which case the use of specific histochemical methods is required for their detection. When organisms are few in number, fluorochromes may be used to increase the microscopic sensitivity of a technique.

These are based on the high affinity that (strept)avidin (Streptomyces avidinii) and avidin (chicken egg) have for biotin. Both possess four binding sites for biotin, but due to the molecular orientation of the binding sites fewer than four molecules of biotin will actually bind. The basic sequence of reagent application consists of primary antibody, biotinylated secondary antibody, followed by either the preformed (strept) avidin-biotin enzyme complex or the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) technique or by the enzyme-labeled streptavidin. Both conclude with the substrate solution. Horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatases are the most commonly used enzyme labels.",

The growing number of patients whose immune status is compromised, or those who can mount only a minimal or inappropriate response to infection, further complicates the picture. This justifies speculative use of special stains, such as those for mycobacteria and fungi on tissue from such patients. It should be remembered, that for a variety of reasons, negative results for the identification of an infectious agent do not exclude its presence. In particular, administration of antibiotics to the patient before a biopsy is often the reason for failure to detect a microorganism in tissue.",

A Gram control should contain both Grampositive and Gram-negative organisms. Post-mortem tissues have previously been a good source of control material, although medico-legal issues have now limited this in some countries. Alternatively, a suspension of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms can be injected into the thigh muscle of a rat shortly before it is sacrificed for some other purpose. Grampositive and Gram-negative organisms can also be harvested from microbiological plates, suspended in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), centrifuged, and small amounts mixed with minced normal kidney, then chemically processed along with other tissue blocks (Swisher & Nicholson, 1989) .",

Staining is due to a mixture of factors, the most important being cell wall thickness, chemical composition and the functional integrity of the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria. When these bacteria die, they become Gram negative. The following procedure is only suitable for the demonstration of bacteria in smears of pus and sputum. It may be of value to the pathologist in the necropsy room where a quick technique such as this may enable rapid identification of the organism causing a lung abscess, wound infection, septicemic abscess or meningitis. Gram method for bacteria in smears (Gram, 1884) Method 1. Fix dry film by passing it three times through a flame or placing on a heat block. 2. Stain for 15 seconds in 1% crystal violet or methyl violet, and then pour off excess. 3. Flood for 30 seconds with Lugol's iodine, pour off excess. 4. Flood with acetone for no more than 2-5 seconds, wash with water immediately. 5. Alternatively decolorize with alcohol until no more stain comes out. Wash with water. 6.

SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. MERS-CoV is a novel coronavirus, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and the majority of cases emerging from the Arabian Peninsula. The risk of infection is linked to exposure to camels and subsequent outbreaks have occurred in healthcare facilities. The incidence and spread of MERS remains an ongoing matter of global public health importance.",

The diseases caused by prions include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD (vCJD), Germann-Straussler-Shienker disease, fatal familial insomnia and kuru in humans and in animals, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as 'mad cow disease'), scrapie (in goats and sheep), and chronic wasting disease (CWD) (in mule deer and elk). Prions are not microbes in the usual sense because they are not alive, but the illness they cause can be transmitted from one animal to another. All usually produce a characteristic spongiform change, neuronal death and astrocytosis in affected brains. The infectious agent is a prion, a small peptide, free of nucleic acid and part of a normal transmembrane glycoprotein which is not, strictly speaking, a virus. Antibodies have been prepared from prion protein which strongly mark accumulated abnormal protein in these diseases (Lantos, 1992) .",

Visit http://www.cdc. gov and search for CJD for a fact sheet and other relevant information. WHO offers a manual in pdf form for downloading. It gives information about what to do should you find yourself with a suspected or known positive case in your laboratory: http://who.int/ bloodproducts/TSE-manual2003.pdf.

            "text": "Entamoeba histolytica, the organism causing amebic colitis or dysentery, can be found in ulcers which occur in infected colon and in amebic liver abscesses. The trophozoite (adult form) measures 15-50 \u03bcm, contains a small nucleus and has a foamy cytoplasm containing ingested red cells and white cell debris. They may be seen in granulation tissue within ulcers on routine H&E staining, or in the luminal mucus overlying normal-appearing mucosa. They are PAS-positive and brief counterstaining in 1% aqueous metanil yellow emphasizes the ingested red cells.Toxoplasma gondii, a commonly encountered organism which is spread in cat litter, causes an acute lymphadenopathy which is often subclinical. Affected nodes show non-specific changes and no organisms. In AIDS and other immunosuppressed patients this protozoon causes systemic diseases, including meningoencephalitis where encysted bradyzoites and free tachyzoites can be seen in necrotic brain tissue. Cysts also occur in other tissues such as cardiac muscle, and measure up to 40 \u03bcm with tachyzoites (4-6 \u03bcm), which can be seen on H&E. A Giemsa stain can also be used, but the use of labeled specific antiserum is recommended (Fig. 16.10) .Leishmania tropica is transmitted by sand-fly bites and causes a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin sometimes called cutaneous leishmaniasis. The injected parasite forms (2 \u03bcm), or amastigotes, are found in large numbers within the cytoplasm of multiple swollen histiocytes which congregate in early lesions in the dermis. A related organism, L. donovani, causes a systemic visceral infection, kala azar, in which the organisms are seen within histiocytes in the spleen, lymph nodes, liver and bone marrow. The organisms are hematoxyphilic and can be emphasized with a Giemsa stain.Giardia duodenalis (lamblia) is a flagellate protozoon which is ingested in cyst form from drinking water with fecal contamination. The trophozoites migrate to the duodenum where they may cause severe diarrhea and malabsorption. These organisms have been seen on an H&E stain where they appear as eosinophilic, sickle-shaped flakes with indistinct nuclei, resting on intestinal mucosa which may show little evidence of inflammation. When seen in a fresh Giemsa-stained duodenal aspirate, they appear kite-shaped, 11-18 \u03bcm in size, binucleate and have faint terminal flagella.Trichomonas vaginalis is a similar flagellate protozoon most frequently seen in a Papanicolaou stain. Inflammatory cells and mildly dysplastic squamous cells often accompany this parasite as it causes cervicitis in the female, and urethritis in both sexes.Cryptosporidium is one of a group of protozoa (including Isospora and Microsporidium) which causes severe and relentless outbreaks of diarrhea among HIV patients. Cryptosporidial gametes are seen on H&E stain as blue dots arranged along the mucosal surface. Mature cysts are shed into feces and are acidfast in a ZN stain of fecal smears.",
