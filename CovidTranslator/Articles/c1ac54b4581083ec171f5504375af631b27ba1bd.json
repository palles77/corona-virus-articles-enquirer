Objectives: To determine the prevalence of KI and WU viruses (KIV and WUV) in 371 respiratory samples and evaluate their contribution to respiratory disease. Study Design: Specimens were screened for KIV and WUV using single, multiplex or real time PCR; co-infection with other respiratory viruses was evaluated. Results: Of the 371 samples analysed, 10 (2.70%) were positive for KIV and 4 (1.08%) were positive for WUV yielding an overall case prevalence of KIV and WUV infection of 3.77%. KIV and WUV were identified in patients aged <15 years (11 patients) with upper or lower respiratory tract infection and >45 years (3 patients) with upper respiratory tract infection. Co-infections were found in 5 (50%) and 3 (75%) of the KIV and WUV positive samples, respectively. Conclusions: This study supports previous conclusions that KIV and WUV detection in the respiratory tract may be coincidental and reflect reactivation of latent or persistent infection with these viruses. The age distribution of KIV and WUV infection in this study mirrors that found for the other human polyomaviruses, BK and JC.",

            "text": "In the present study, KIV and WUV infected individuals were found in two main age groups: <15 years and >45 years. A relatively high proportion of KIV and WUV infections were observed in the oldest (>60 years) age group. Infection in patients <15 years was more frequently associated with lower respiratory tract symptoms. They also showed more frequent co-infections with other respiratory viruses. The older age group patients (>45 years old) were more likely to have symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract infection. Samples collected from patients whose age was >18 months tended to be patients undergoing solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, treatment of cancer (particularly leukaemia), or were hospitalised because of severe, life threatening, acute respiratory distress. These data suggest that infection with KIV and WUV occurs early in childhood. The viruses may then establish persistent infection possibly in the respiratory tract and become reactivated during respiratory disease of any cause. The age distribution of positive cases in this study presents a pattern of infection similar to that seen with JCV and BKV. Further studies of the seroprevalence of KIV and WUV in different age groups will shed light on this issue.",
