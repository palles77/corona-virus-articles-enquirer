The aim of the current study was to investigate the potential role of PRINS in diabetic nephropathy. The relative mRNA expression level of PRINS and SMAD family member 7 (Smad7) was examined in patients with diabetes, including patients without obvious complications (n=43), patients with diabetic nephropathy (n=33), diabetic retinopathy (n=37), diabetic cardiomyopathy (n=29), diabetic lung disease (n=38) and healthy controls (n=48). Correlation analysis between the expression level of PRINS and Smad7 was analyzed by Pearson's correlation analysis. In addition, overexpression of PRINS was confirmed in mouse podocyte cells and cell viability and Smad7 protein expression was detected by MTT assay and western blot analysis, respectively. The expression levels of PRINS and Smad7 were significantly increased in patients with diabetes compared with healthy controls. In addition, the expression levels of PRINS and Smad7 were significantly increased in patients with diabetic nephropathy compared with other diabetic complications. The expression level of PRINS in mouse podocyte cells was upregulated following treatment with high glucose. A significant positive correlation between the expression level of PRINS and Smad7 was observed in patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, there was no correlation was observed in other patient groups compared with healthy controls. Overexpression of PRINS decreased the viability of mouse podocyte cells and enhanced Smad7 protein expression. Taken together, these results suggest that PRINS may be involved in the development of nephropathy in patients with diabetes.",

Diabetes is often accompanied by the development of complications that affect most major organ systems (2) . The most common diabetes-related complications include blindness, renal failure and cardiovascular disease (2) . However, one of the more serious complications associated with diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, can cause long-term kidney disease and end-stage renal disease and is a leading cause of death among patients with diabetes (3) . Although there have been significant improvements in the treatment and prevention of renal damage in patients with diabetes, patient outcomes remain poor (4) . Current treatment is focused on the prevention of disease progression (5) . Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic targets may improve the survival of patients with diabetic nephropathy.",

In addition, the current study demonstrated that PRINS may be involved in the development of nephropathy in patients with diabetes, and PRINS may exert its biological function by upregulating Smad7 expression. Treatment with high glucose can affect normal metabolism in patients with diabetes, which can directly or indirectly affect the expression of a large number of lncRNAs (16, 17) . Expression patterns of lncRNAs can change depending on whether they accelerate or inhibit disease progression (16, 17) . Circulating lncRNAs can serve as signaling molecules under pathological conditions to induce systemic reactions in patients with diabetes, including insulin resistance and accelerated senescence (18) . Upregulation of PRINS was observed following acute tubule damage in rat kidney transplantation (15) . The current study demonstrated that PRINS was significantly upregulated in patients with diabetes compared with healthy controls. In addition, PRINS expression was significantly upregulated in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, treatment with high glucose significantly upregulated the expression level of PRINS in a time-and dose-dependent manner in mouse podocyte cells. Therefore, the upregulation of PRINS expression may be induced by both high glucose and renal damage. In addition, the level of serum PRINS may be used to distinguish patients with diabetes with diabetic nephropathy from those without renal damage.",

However, Smad7 can also inhibit renal fibrosis in animal models of chronic kidney disease (19) . Furthermore, Smad7 can serve a protective role in the mouse model of chronic aristolochic acid nephropathy (20) . In the current study, the expression level of Smad7 was significantly upregulated in patients with diabetes compared with healthy controls, and in particular patients with diabetic nephropathy. Previous findings demonstrated that Smad7-deficient mice developed more severe diabetic kidney injury compared with wild-type mice under high glucose conditions, and although renal Smad7 had no effect on blood glucose, it significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2/Smad3-mediated renal fibrosis and the development of microalbuminuria in the rat diabetic model (21) , indicating the protective role of Smad7 in diabetic nephropathy. The current study demonstrated that overexpression of PRINS decreased the viability of mouse podocyte cells, which are critical for renal function (22) , and enhanced Smad7 protein expression. In addition, a significantly positive correlation between the expression of PRINS and Smad7 was observed in patients with diabetic nephropathy, however, no correlation was observed in patients with ther diabetes-related complications. PRINS may therefore serve different roles in diabetic nephropathy; it may promote the apoptosis of podocyte cells and upregulate Smad7 protein expression to inhibit GF-\u03b2/Smad3-mediated renal fibrosis. However, further studies are required to understand more about this complex regulatory network.",
