Our effort seeks to improve access to relevant information for the public health profession, to help those in the field remain an information-savvy workforce.

            "text": "The need for improved access to high quality public health information has been stated by public health professionals for well over a decade. Further, recent infectious disease outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Asian bird flu, along with growing concern about acts of bioterrorism, such as the 2001 anthrax episode in the US Postal Service, have brought unprecedented urgency to the information needs of the public health workforce (LaPelle, Luckmann, Hatheway Simpson, & Martin, 2006) . As stated in that source, this information falls into various distinct categories, from newly identified health risks to reports on preventive health behaviors and new interventions known to be effective. Indeed, it has been estimated that as much as 50% of the health status of the American public is attributable to health behaviors and related factors (Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, & Gerberding, 2004) . Public health practitioners share with their counterparts in clinical medicine the task of helping the public be more aware of achieving and maintaining healthy behaviors-the former in more population-based approaches while the latter at the individual patient level. The substance of public health practice involves \"organized community effort to address the public interest in health\u2026to prevent disease and promote health\" (at http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1091&page=7, IOM, 1998) . At its core is program development which entails broad community involvement, promotion of a scientific basis for decision making, strategic alliances, and development of comprehensive public health policies to promote and encourage healthy behaviors. Health promotion at the community level takes many forms-from social marketing and targeted communication through various media (radio, television, internet) , to joint health education efforts with schools, churches, work sites, and the like, to collaboration with health care providers on health messages and programs, to advocacy for and implementation of policies and legislation that create healthy environments. Public health professionals require relevant information about successful health promotion policies and programs but often lack the time and skills required to effectively search for well designed, evaluated studies and practices that might be considered for application within their own communities. Natural language processing and semantic techniques can facilitate these tasks by organizing and structuring this \"knowledge\" into a coherent conceptual public health framework. The current project aims to expand existing National Library of Medicine [NLM] semantic resources to facilitate advanced access to online documents on Health Promotion. This paper describes the methodology implemented to extend a Unified Medical Language System (UMLS\u00ae)-based natural language processing application, SemRep (Rindflesch, Fiszman, & Libbus, 2005) , to the previously unsupported domain of health promotion, within the broader context of public health. This approach leverages existing UMLS knowledge and integrates a newly defined semantic space with the semantic structure afforded by the UMLS (Humphreys, Lindberg, Schoolman, & Barnett, 1998) . (Rindflesch et al., 2005) is an NLP advanced information management application. It enhances document retrieval with the support of the UMLS knowledge sources (biomedical field) as the domain ontology. SemRep extracts relationships from biomedical text by mapping textual content to an ontology which represents the meaning of the text. SemRep extractions, called semantic predications, consist of assertions derived from sentences in PubMed titles and abstracts. A semantic predication contains three parts: a subject, an object, and the relation that links them. For example, from a sentence such as (1) in which the underlined expressions stand for the subject and object, respectively, SemRep derives the predication in (2):",

Those terms that share the same meaning are classed under the same concept. For example, expressions such as \"Post-traumatic Stress Disorder\" and \"PTSD\" are classed under the UMLS concept 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic.' Each Metathesaurus concept is assigned a semantic type such as \"Disease or Syndrome\" or \"Gene or Genome,\" which allows semantically similar concepts to be clustered under the same semantic type. For instance, the concept \"Sertraline\" in sentence (1) and its synonym \"Zoloft\" have the semantic type \"Pharmacologic Substance,\" while \"PTSD\" has the semantic type \"Disease or Syndrome.\" The predication in (2) presented earlier derives from the more abstract Semantic Network relation in (4), in which the semantic types take the place of the argument concepts:",

These semantic types are allowed as arguments of the TREATS relation, as specified in the UMLS Semantic Network, which stipulates co-occurrence restrictions for arguments of different predicates based on the semantic types of the arguments. For an indicator and its syntactic arguments to be interpreted as a semantic predication, the semantic types of the Metathesaurus concepts for the noun phrase arguments must match the semantic types allowed to serve as arguments of the given predicate in the Semantic Network.

Thus, bridging the gap between the textual expressions and the UMLS Semantic Network relations involves a manual process. For instance, in addition to 'treatment' as in (1), terms such as 'management,' 'ameliorates,' 'heals,' and 'relief' can also mean TREATS when used with the appropriate arguments. Extending SemRep to cover health promotion concepts and predicates not in the UMLS, or used with a different meaning than the ones intended for the medical domain, also entails discovering the links or relationships between domain concepts and the syntactic expressions that point to these relationships.",

This tool helps manage results from search engines such as PubMed\u00ae by manipulating information in addition to documents. The information retrieved is summarized and presented in a graph as a network of concepts and relations extracted by SemRep. Figure 1 displays the network of concepts and relations derived from a PubMed search on 'Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.' The concept searched for is at the center in the lower part of the graph. The colors of the boxes represent the semantic groups to which the concepts belong. In Figure 1 , pink boxes represent Disorders, grey boxes correspond to Therapeutic Procedures, yellow boxes correspond to Substances, and blue boxes, to Populations. While boxes represent concepts, color-coded directional arrows (color key on the right) represent the labeled relation that bind two concepts. By looking at the colored arrows (the relation) and the concepts they link, we can interpret entities such as \"Cognitive therapy TREATS Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic,\" \"Inflammation Process AFFECTS Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic.\"",

The underlying syntactic processing and argument identification are general, while indicator rules are domain specific, to a large extent. Many concepts and relations important in other fields may already exist in the UMLS (clinical domain) and are thus already incorporated into its ontological sources (MeSH). SemRep takes advantage of the already existing knowledge, and supplements it with domain-specific concepts and relations needed for interpretation, and which are either missing from the UMLS or inappropriately represented for the new domain. Due to this SemRep characteristic, only domain-specific ontological aspects need to be enhanced when extending coverage to new disciplines. New domain-specific entities are formalized and written in the same UMLS format so they can be seamlessly incorporated into the UMLS existing machinery. New concepts are allowed to co-occur both with other new domain concepts and others currently existing in the UMLS, to be used with existing and new relations, as illustrated in examples (6) to (12) in the Methods section.",

NLP-based systems often depend on ontologies to support a semantic representation. For example, in a newly developed semantic representation for automatic information extraction from dental clinical records (Irwin, Harkema, Christensen, Schleyer, Haug, & Chapman, 2009) , the contents of semantic representations were found to be excessively document-bound and application-specific to be useful in modeling domainrelevant concepts and relations. While results in domain ontologies rarely fit well with the information in actual text, building a new ontology for each specific application undermines two important characteristics of ontologies, namely, that they facilitate both knowledge sharing and data reuse (Bodenreider, 2008) , thus laying the groundwork for future semantic integration (Noy, 2009 ). These characteristics of ontologies play a fundamental role in supporting the extension of SemRep coverage to a new domain. Rather than creating a new ontology for a new domain, we profit from UMLS knowledge that is common to both domains, focusing only on the development of the entities needed for domain-specific knowledge representation and which are not fully or adequately represented in the UMLS. Thus we take advantage of the distinction between the general and domain-specific aspects in SemRep. This affords us considerable savings in time and labor by enabling the reuse of existing knowledge, and facilitates the semantic integration (Noy, 2009 ) of the new knowledge with the UMLS content, as described in the Methods section.",

There is wide consensus on the importance of building domain models or ontologies in developing knowledge based systems, as ontologies provide a structural framework for natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, to be useful for purposes or domains different from the ones they were originally designed for, the ontology coverage often needs to be extended. Extension of existing ontologies is highly recommended, as explained in Bodenreider (2008) and Noy (2009) over creating separate ontologies as in (Irwin et al., 2009) . Various other projects have extended ontologies and terminologies to meet different needs or for other applications. In the biomedical domain, for example, an expansion of terms relevant to muscle biology was incorporated into the Gene Ontology (GO Ontology) (Feltrin, Campanaro, Diehl, Ehler, Faulkner, Fordham,\u2026Deegan, 2009 ); Chen, Morrey, Gu, Halper, and Perl (2009) uses the OTR Ontology for automatic case classification of incoming HL7 messages, analyzed by content \"to determine syndromic classification and routing.\" Its ontological knowledge representation is based on HL7 complex data types, while concept representation is based on SNOMED (Stearns, Price, Spackman, and Wang, 2001) , to which syndromes in the International Classification of Diseases -9 th Revision-Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) were mapped.

While we use a similar bottom-up approach as in Buitelaar et al. (2005) , we differ in that we integrate the new knowledge into a higher-level knowledge source (UMLS), either mapping to it or framing the new entities in accordance with its constructs (e.g., semantic types). Our focus is on ontological and terminological supplementation to the Metathesaurus and the Semantic Network for domain-relevant coverage, enriching our application to recognize domainspecific classes of concepts while relying on the semantic structure of the UMLS. Hierarchical relations as defined in the UMLS semantic types and predicates only apply to UMLS semantic types and thus do not extend to new domain-specific semantic types and relations. However, many UMLS relations that SemRep supports are nonhierarchical (e.g., COMPLICATES, DIAGNOSES, among others). The Metathesaurus requires augmentation with new concepts and semantic types, and the Semantic Network requires augmentation with new domain-specific relations. This project benefited from an automated program developed in-house designed to facilitate the identification of core domain concepts not in the UMLS. In the sections that follow, we describe how SemRep has been enriched to recognize the new classes of concepts that play a role in this domain as well as new domainrelevant semantic relations, such as ADDRESSES, HINDERS, and PROVIDES, to name a few. The resulting network of concepts and relations is supported by a semantic representation which requires the definition of the ontological space of Health Promotion.

For example, demographics and physical and social environments can be used as channels or venues to foster healthier behavioral changes; organizational settings such as community clinics or hospitals serve populations by targeting certain problems or conditions, and the programs or policies that address them can be specifically designed for the target population. By monitoring undesirable or risky health behaviors and incidence of disease and mortality rates which define public health issues in different populations, policies and programs to address them can be developed and implemented to help mitigate these health issues before they become a public health problem. Recognizing that differing demographic characteristics can trigger disparities in access to--or delivery of--health care, the policies and programs aim at eliminating barriers to accessibility to healthcare as part of a sustained effort towards the elimination of health disparities, defined as the difference in \"health status between a defined portion of the population and the majority\" in Carter- Pokras & Baoljet (2002) .

The corpus collected is also processed through a program we developed that attempts to map noun phrases to already existing Metathesaurus concepts. This program separates the UMLS concept-mapping noun phrases from the others. The output files are used for preliminary assessment of UMLS coverage in the new domain. Domain-relevant concepts and relations not included in the UMLS are added to supplementary files, so new, more domain-appropriate semantic types of concepts can be defined.

This is distinctive of sentences in this category, as the expression of effectiveness, results, or impact often includes the entities to which they apply, to complete the meaning of the sentence. Differentiating entities as per the categories is a clear-cut task, but one sentence may contain parts of different categories, with different entities in the sentence belonging to different themes. The sentence is the unit that holds all those entities, which renders the delineation in terms of categories not so clear-cut at the sentence level, where the various entities interact. When classifying sentences, the same sentential unit may be duplicated in different areas. This is especially the case with the Assurance category sentences, as in the process of conceptualizing where the various actors fit and how they interact, it became apparent that the Assurance category ties together all other categories and subcategories in this domain, but with clear elements that set it apart from the other two. For example, differences in demographic factors or population groups (Assessment category) often lead to health disparities, and to fulfill the health promotion goal of eliminating disparities, programs and interventions are planned, designed, and implemented (Policy Development). Measures are then taken to assure that all the conditions are in place for the proper implementation of the programs as designed with the expected outcomes (Assurance category). These interrelationships also account for the many more sentences in this category (N=474) with respect to the others. Building a model which can point out potential correlations between \"Assurance\" statements and \"Assessment\" (such as in demographic factors or health issues) would provide valuable insights, but determining the extent to which greater refinement of the relationship between \"Assurance\" and the other categories might be helpful is beyond the scope of this work.",

For UMLS concepts that appeared to be relevant in the domain texts and displayed those semantic types, the UMLS-assigned semantic type was changed to capture more adequately the meaning as used in this domain (Table VI) . A total of 130 UMLS-mapping concepts were contextualized this way. Missing synonyms for existing concepts were also added if needed (Table VII) . For example, within the context of smoking cessation programs, an important public health initiative, the expression 'quitter' was added as a synonym of UMLS concept 'former smoker' because it frequently appeared in our training set with that meaning.

This is not surprising, as most of the current research in this area is geared towards having better mappings and more accurate NLP processing. Domain-inadequate mappings are an unwelcome consequence when using any higher-level knowledge source since it lacks the required level of granularity for specific domains. In working towards a solution for this issue, we have developed a mechanism to prevent those infelicitous mappings when dealing with domain concepts, either by specifically canceling some mappings, or replacing them with ones that are more contextually appropriate, grounded in the texts, as needed.Argument identification plays an important role in any NLP system, and SemRep is no exception. It goes beyond missing concepts. For example, a domain-appropriate UMLS term with the wrong semantic type for this domain will be missed by SemRep. This would require changing the semantic type so it adequately captures the meaning as used in this domain, as the examples in Table  VI show, facilitating the generation of a true positive predication if adequately specified in the co-occurrence rules. Missing UMLS concepts and missing SemRep rules, such as extending the semantic types allowed to co-occur in specific predicates, are easily incorporated into SemRep's supplementary domain files, but only after relevant texts bring the missing entities to light. We are guided by the data to avoid overgeneration of relationships, which could result in false positive predications. There are no across-the-board solutions for any single issue.",

Program improvements and efforts to elicit more accurate mappings notwithstanding, it is impossible to attain 100% accuracy with an automatic text analysis methodology such as SemRep. Further, punctuation errors, misspellings, and related issues in text often get in the way as well. Despite these drawbacks, SemRep users find it quite useful having a Web application in which large-scale information retrieval is summarized automatically and visualized as a network of semantic predications.

Semantic MEDLINE (Kilicoglu et al., 2008) , an advanced information management UMLSbased application, is intended to assist users by helping them manage the results of PubMed searches. Since it relies on SemRep-which in turn relies on UMLS knowledge-to extract semantic predications from PubMed titles and abstracts, it is mainly limited to biomedicine, and uses NLP, automatic summarization, and visualization to represent key entities in a given domain. Extracted predications can be visualized as an informative graph with links to the original citations. Its application in the Health Promotion arena depends on the development of an ontology to support it (with increased precision) with managing, summarizing, and visualizing the results of searching health-related information documents.",

In our system, this evaluation can be done with the visualization architecture of information extracted, mapped against the ontology, and condensed into a network of core domain concepts and their binding relations. While this project is still in the laboratory phase, we are considering having it explored with potential users through well-known resources such as NLM's Public Health Partners (accessed at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nno/partners.html) for ways in which it can be refined and more widely applied to public health practice. As demonstrated by the results of our preliminary evaluation, such a tool can go a long way towards improving access to manageable relevant information for public health practitioners and for the public health community at large, an important step in assisting the members of all communities in achieving the goal of becoming active participants in bringing about the desirable changes that are needed for a healthier society.

While arrows correspond to relations, boxes represent concepts. All concepts with the same semantic type are shaded with dark/light shades of the same color. Lighter color boxes contain current UMLS concepts with the originally assigned semantic type, as in 'Hispanics' (Population Group) and 'Low Back Pain' (Disease or Syndrome). Darker boxes with italics represent new concepts added, often with new semantic types (e.g., Church coalition, Clinical Setting).
