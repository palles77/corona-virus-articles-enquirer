CT studies were normal or showed only mild ventricular dilatation in most reported cases [5] [6] [7] [8] [10] [11] [12] . The initial CT of one patient showed an enhancing lesion in the right temporal lobe; follow-up CT 10 months later showed low attenuation in both medial temporal lobes [4] . MR imaging has proven helpful for the diagnosis of temporal lobe lesions [13] . Literature review revealed only six cases of limbic encephalitis with M R imaging (Table 1) . M R failed to show abnormalities compatible with timbic encephalitis in three patients [3, 7, 8] . MR obtained in the later phase of one patient showed only temporal lobe tissue loss [4] . MR revealed abnormal signal intensity in the medial temporal lobes bilaterally in only two of the six patients [5, 6] . The most striking T2-weighted MR findings in the previously reported cases, as well as our own, are the high-signal intensities in both medial temporal lobes, including the hippocampal formations and amygdalae. The cortex was predominantly involved, and there was tittle or no mass effect in the surrounding structures. Involvement of the insula, cingulate gyrus, pyriform cortex, orbital surface of the frontal lobe, and the hypothalamus in limbic encephalitis has been reported pathologically [8] . However, successful display of the involvement of these structures, as shown in our first case, has not previously been documented in the radiological literature.",

Abnormal signal intensity first appeared in the hippocampal formations on follow-up MR examinations. From these findings, we conclude that the clinical symptoms of limbic encephalitis can present at a time when inflammatory changes are too mild to produce abnormal signals on MR images. Therefore, repeat MR examination is mandatory even if the initial study fails to reveal any abnormalities. Furthermore, our present cases suggest that the inflammation in limbic encephalitis does not necessarily occur simultaneously throughout the brain, and acute inflammatory changes can resolve without any residual radiologically detectable abnormalities. The latter does not necessarily imply that microscopic abnormalities are absent.",

Bilateral temporal lobe involvement can also occur in viral encephalitis such as herpes encephafitis [15] . Indeed, the neuropathological findings of limbic encephalitis can simulate those of viral encephalitis. Based on the latter findings, a viral etiology has been suggested for limbic encephalitis, although direct evidence of viral infection has not been demonstrated [8, 16] .",
