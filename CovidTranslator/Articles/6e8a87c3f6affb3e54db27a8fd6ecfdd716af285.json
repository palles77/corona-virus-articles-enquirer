Many individuals with CRS continue to suffer lifelong, despite aggressive management with currently available treatments [2] . The pathogenesis of CRS is poorly understood, resulting in no definitive curative therapy at present. Previous cross-sectional studies in CRS have provided valuable information to characterize the differences between patients and controls, and in establishing models to study the pathophysiology of CRS. However, currently key molecule(s) that play pivotal roles at disease inception and/or progression are poorly understood [3] . One way to address this major gap in knowledge may be to study the immunological changes that occur during acute exacerbation of this chronic disease.",

Pre-enrolled patients were asked to contact study personnel within 24 hours of the worsening of their respiratory symptoms (nasal congestion, drainage, sense of smell) for collection of airway specimens. We found that the protocol was feasible and that the levels of IL-5, IL-6, IL-33, and eosinophil major basic protein (MBP) in nasal specimens increased during acute exacerbation of the disease [4] . In the current study, we extended this self-reported disease exacerbation model and explored two major questions: (1) Is the local immunologic response in the upper respiratory tract during acute exacerbation different between patients with CRSwNP and normal controls? (2) Can a unique immunologic response be detected in serum during CRSwNP exacerbation that is distinct from that seen in normal individuals?",

To allow for a simultaneous comparison of unrelated biomarkers, expression values for each specific biomarker were normalized across all subjects. Normalization was performed using the following algorithm: V norm = (V act \u2212 V m ) / SD. V norm is the normalized value, V act is the raw value of the biomarker expression, V m is the mean raw value, and SD is the standard deviation across subjects. Since distances have no meaning in negative values, the minimum V norm value for a biomarker was scaled to zero and reminder were scaled by same measure preserving the relationship. This algorithm preserves the proportional relationship of a biomarker across patients allowing parallel comparisons in a simultaneous manner for different biomarkers. Data was then converted into a format suitable for generating network layouts, and graphs were generated using Gephi 0.8.2 (software for visualizing and analyzing network graphs; www.gephi.org) [8] . Graphical representation of all subjects and biomarkers was denoted by respective nodes (subject nodes and biomarker nodes) and their relationships were denoted by linked line connections called edges. The transformed V norm values formed the basis of these edges. A force-directed algorithm (Force Atlas) [8] which pulls similar nodes together and pushes dissimilar nodes apart was applied to reveal emergent associations. Clusters seen in the network were corroborated, and boundaries of cluster membership defined using unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Node size was set between a range of 15 to 60 units prior to quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis of total biomarker expression was performed using weighted-degree centrality [where the size of a node is the aggregate of all connections made with the node, i.e., number of connections and strength of connections]. Biological inference of molecular clusters and discovery of predicted functional partners and pathways were done in Cytoscape (version 3.1.0 http://www.cytoscape.org/) using the geneMANIA plugin [9, 10] .",

To examine which molecules were most expressed in the network, we compared the weighteddegree centrality (WDC) of each biomarker node (an aggregate measure of the number and the strength of connections made with a node. As seen in Fig. 6B , the biomarkers belonging predominantly to two biomarker clusters A and B were greater than mean WDC.

These data extend our previous findings in CRSwNP patients and verify that IL-5, IL-6, and MBP are elevated locally in nasal secretions of CRSwNP patients during exacerbation. Increased levels of IL-6 in CRSwNP patients at baseline may reflect dysregulated proinflammatory innate immunity, which further increases upon exposure to an inciting stimulus, such as viral infection. Potential roles for the IL-6 and STAT3 pathways in CRSwNP were reported previously by other investigators [15] . Furthermore, increased levels of MBP and IL-5 during exacerbation may point to the involvement of local type 2 immune responses and eosinophilic inflammation. The results are also consistent with observations in previous cross-sectional studies that describe the potential roles of Th2cytokines and eosinophils in CRSwNP patients in the U.S [16] [17] [18] . Altogether, IL-6, IL-5, and eosinophils may play important roles in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP under steady-state conditions and during exacerbation of the disease.",

The differences were greater than the minimum significant difference [6] , and therefore, the SNOT-22 tool may be suitable for use for research studies that employ self-reported natural exacerbation. On the other hand, the overall SNOT-22 scores did not differ between CRSwNP patients and normal controls during exacerbation (Fig. 2) , suggesting that this tool may not be able to discriminate between these groups at the height of exacerbation. The SNOT-22 questionnaire has been used recently for measuring and predicting outcomes in CRS patients, including endoscopic sinus surgery [19] and clinical trials with surfactant [20] , corticosteroid irrigation [21] , longterm azithromycin [22] , and saline irrigation [23] . The current study adds to this growing body of literature, supporting the use of questionnaires such as SNOT-22 as indicators for disease exacerbation, but also suggests potential caution when interpreting the SNOT-22 data in normal control subjects experiencing an acute exacerbation of upper respiratory symptoms.",

Serum markers are useful because they are easily accessed by established and noninvasive standardized collection procedures and serum specimens are near homogeneous. Indeed, serum biomarkers, such as periostin, have been used recently in efforts to predict treatment benefit in patients with asthma [24] . Furthermore, we found that the biomarker spectrum in nasal secretion and serum was not identical, suggesting that both systemic and local specimens need to be examined in an effort to identify best biomarkers for clinical practice and research. We undertook a methodical screening approach using network visualization tool to study serum parameters in CRS exacerbation. Biological parameters can be analyzed by pre-selected variables based on pre acquired, scientific knowledge or by using methods that aid in discovery of patterns in larger sets of data. Conventional analyses employ measurements of central tendency, such as median, mean, or mode, for a limited number of variables, which allows organization and interpretation of data; however, in the process may compress outliers and individual variations, and thus potentially risk missing important clues of information. In contrast, unsupervised simultaneous variable analysis methods allow for the concurrent overview of a high number of variables without compression of information. In particular, certain novel multivariate methods, such as network analysis employ unsupervised learning, allowing the data to reveal patterns without a priori assumptions in comparator classes (e.g., cases and controls) leading to discovery of associations and correlations without preconceived distinctions. The potential advantage of employing such methods is to identify high-level patterns during an initial step, which can then be further focused and substantiated using conventional analyses.",

By focused analysis, raw protein concentration of VEGF and GM-CSF was also significantly increased during exacerbation in CRSwNP compared to controls or to their baseline values. Local production of both VEGF and GM-CSF in polyp tissues has been documented previously [25] [26] [27] and their presence in serum may be an important marker for specific exacerbation. Further investigation is necessary to examine whether detection of these factors in blood represents a 'spillover' from local production (outside-in effect). As judged by their biological functions, VEGF and GM-CSF may play pivotal roles in tissue remodeling, and innate and adaptive immunity of nasal and sinus mucosa, respectively. Larger studies focusing on these molecules will be necessary to investigate their roles in pathological changes in CRSwNP and other chronic airway diseases.",

The objective separation of study participant clusters during exacerbation phase revealed \"cross-over\" subjects whose biomarker signature mimicked their cluster mates but clinically were included in the opposite group. Thus, based on molecular data, the presence of 'case-like' controls and 'control-like' cases could represent the heterogeneity of human subjects with differing levels of immune dysregulation, which may escalate during acute exacerbation. Indeed, heterogeneity in regard to the involvement of different immunological pathways and differences in responses likely exists in CRSwNP patients [28] .

Unexpectedly, we found no statistical difference in the IL-33 levels between CRSwNP patients and control subjects during exacerbation. There are a few possible reasons that may explain this finding. Timing of specimen collection could be an important factor, since IL-33 is released within hours in animal models [29] and may have been released acutely prior to the patient reaching the clinic for sample collection. Other explanations may include the potential variability in nasal specimen collection techniques and confounding treatment effects of topical corticosteroids. Alternatively, IL-33 may not be a key factor in the initiation of inflammation in a significant proportion of CRSwNP patients studied. Similarly, other immunologic measurements that were negative in this study share the possible risk of being falsely negative because of the small sample size. Second, we allowed treatment interventions per the usual care for subjects in the study (including continuation of baseline treatments in the CRSwNP group, such as topical corticosteroids), which could have influenced the natural history of disease exacerbation.",

We demonstrated that an immune signature of increased growth factors is detected systemically and uniquely in CRSwNP patients during exacerbation regardless of nature of exacerbating trigger (allergic versus viral infection etc). This suggests that such a prospective self-reported exacerbation model may provide insights into the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of an unsupervised learning model to clinical studies in CRS, showing it may be feasible in larger studies. Indeed, the power of the network analysis may lay in the identification of clusters of biomarkers and patients, while elucidating their interactions. Moreover, studies with greater numbers of subjects will also likely reveal novel immunological phenotypes of CRS and specific pathways that operate in each subtype. This supposition brings us closer to the concept of personalized medicine in CRS, leading to appropriate and cost-effective management of a very common but vastly heterogeneous disorder.
