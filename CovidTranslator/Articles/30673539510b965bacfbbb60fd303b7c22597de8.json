The hemagglutinin (HA), one of eight protein-coding genes, plays an important role during the early stage of infection. To study their evolution and zoonotic potential, we conducted an in silico analysis of H9N2 viruses that have infected broiler in Tehran Province, Iran between 1998 and 2007. The complete coding region of HA genes from nine H9N2 subtypes isolated from chicken flocks in Tehran Province during 1998-2007 was amplified and sequenced. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic studies of H9N2 subtype viruses on the basis of data of 9 viruses in this study and 30 selected strains are available in the GenBank. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed a large number of similar substitution mutations and close evolutionary relation among sequences of HA. The isolates possessed two types of amino acid motif -R-S-S-R/G-Land -R-S-N-R/G-L-at the cleavage site of HA. The results showed that all nine representative H9N2 isolates belong to low pathogenic AIVs since none of the amino acid sequences at the cleavage site of the HA of the isolates possessed the basic motif required for highly pathogenic viruses (R-X-R/K-R). Six out of these nine isolates possessed leucine at position 226, which prevails in the sequences found in human strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all our isolates belonged to the G1-like sublineage. Also, these isolates showed some degree of homology with other H9N2 isolates, e.g., 89.46-93.93.39% with qu/HK/G1/97 and 93.39-98.39% with pa/Narita/92A/98. The available evidence indicates that HA genes of H9 influenza virus circulating in Iran during the past years were not well conserved. Our finding emphasizes the importance of reinforcing AIV surveillance, especially after the emergence of high pathogenicity in poultry in Iran.",

            "text": "H9N2 viruses have widely circulated in the world since their first detection from turkeys in Wisconsin in1966 (Homme and Easterday 1970) . H9N2 influenza viruses have become panzootic in Eurasia during the past decade and have been isolated from terrestrial poultry worldwide. The H9N2 subtype virus is a conspicuous member of the influenza family because it can infect not only chickens, ducks, and pigs but also humans (Kwon et al. 2006b ). Avian influenza viruses (AIV) are segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae and are divided into five genera: influenza A, B, C, Thogtovirus, and Isavirus (Fields et al. 2007 ). The AIV genome consists of eight segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA that encode at least ten proteins including two surface glycoproteins [hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)], nucleoprotein, three polymerase proteins (polymerase basic 2, PB1, and polymerase acidic), two matrix (M1 and M2) proteins, and two non-structural (NS1 and NS2) proteins. Influenza A viruses are classified into a number of subtypes based on antigenic differences in their two surface glycoproteins, HA (16 subtypes) and NA (nine subtypes) (Fields et al. 2007; Harder and Werner 2006) . One of the surface viral proteins, HA, undergoes frequent antigenic variation and plays a crucial role in the pathogenicity of influenza viruses. Analysis of receptor specificity of HA has indicated that HA is very important for virus transmission and is a major determinant in host range. HA is involved in the early stages of infection, causing the binding of the sialic acid receptor present on the host cell surface, and leading to fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane and subsequent entry into the host cell. The HA genes have vital relation to viral pathogenicity, antigenicity, and host range of influenza viruses, although some researchers indicated that these traits are polygenic (Jordan 2001; Swayne 2008; Webster et al. 1992) .",

The difference in the pathogenicity is mainly determined by the HA gene and the presence of additional basic amino acids at the proteolytic cleavage site. HA of low-pathogenicity AIVs is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases that are associated with respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells, confining the infection to these sites. In contrast, HA from HPAIVs can be cleaved by the aforementioned proteases and also by ubiquitous furin proteases, leading to a generalized infection (Alexander 2000; Jordan 2001; Swayne 2008) .",

The mortality is usually 5-30% depending on the type of husbandry.

Mortality rates in some broiler farms in Iran are up to 65% (Nili and Asasi 2003; Nili and Asasi 2002; Vasfi Marandi et al. 2002) . However, the isolate was characterized as non-highly pathogenic in the laboratory. Mixed infections of influenza virus with other respiratory pathogens have been found to be responsible for such a high mortality, resulting in great economic losses. Mosleh et al. (2009) showed that the Iranian H9N2 influenza viruses had the ability to replicate in some organs like the spleen, kidney, and other organs, which was previously unexpected for low virulence avian influenza virus. These results indicated that Iranian H9N2 virus may cause some changes in their structure (Mosleh et al. 2009 ). The association of high mortality in recent years and report ofH5N1 and H9N2 in wild birds in Iran raised the probability of a new genetically modified avian influenza virus (Shoushtari et al. 2008 ). In the present study, the HA gene of H9N2AI viruses that has been isolated from commercial chickens in Iran during 1998-2007 was sequenced. The aim of the present research was to elucidate the phylogenic and evolutionary relationships of HA genes (full length) of H9N2 among these isolates and examine the relationships among these viruses and other viruses isolated from avian in the neighboring countries or areas.",

The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 500 \u03bcl of 75% ethanol was added to the pellet. After centrifugation at 7,500\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was dried at room temperature for few minutes. Finally, the pellet was diluted in 20 \u03bcl DEPC water. To help in dissolving, the tube was placed in 55\u221260\u00b0C water bath for 10 min and stored at \u221270\u00b0C for RT-PCR reaction (Sambrook et al. 2001 ).",

            "text": "The pathogenicity of H5 and H7 influenza viruses is associated with the presence of multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of HA, yet no motif standards have been established to evaluate the high or low pathogenic H9 subtype viruses. However, Guo et al. supposed that only one nucleotide substitution could change serine to arginine and produce the basic motif required for highly pathogenic viruses (Guo et al. 2001 ). However, the presence of this particular motif also emphasizes that these viruses have the potential to become pathogenic should they acquire any further nucleotide substitutions in the HA-connecting peptide region. The finding suggests that the H9N2 influenza viruses circulating in poultry in Iran have the potential to become highly pathogenic. All the H9 viruses tested (except TH85 and TH386) in this study possessed the motif of -P-A-R-S-S-R/G-L-, which was identical to the sequences of Gl and Y280. All recurrent H9N2 viruses possessed the single basic amino acid at the cleavage site, and they were classified as LPAI viruses. The nucleotide sequence of the HA cleavage sites of these viruses showed that only one additional nucleotide substitution (T or C to A) is needed at two positions to change serine (S) to arginine (R) and produce the basic motif required for highly pathogenic viruses (R/K-X-R-R); cleavage site motif in TH386 is similar to isolates of Israel such as AAZ14994 and AAZ14120. PARSNRG motif is specific to isolates of Israel (Peiris et al. 1999b ). This motif does not exist in Iranian isolation before 2007. Amino acid in cleavage site of TH85 (PTRSSRG) is found in isolates with accession numbers AAL65235 and ABV46459 . These isolates are in Chinese isolates group (Perk et al. 2006a) . During 10 years of observation, -R-S-S-R-motif predominated among the Iranian isolates (Kianizadeh et al. 2006; Toroghi and Momayez 2006; Karimi et al. 2008 However, the presence of this particular motif also emphasizes that these viruses have the potential to become pathogenic should they acquire any further nucleotide substitutions in the HA-connecting peptide region. These isolates show some levels of substitution, indicating antigenic drift (Ghadi et al. 2010 ). Glycosylation of HA and NA can affect the host specificity, virulence, and infectivity of an influenza strain either directly, by changing the biological properties of HA and NA, or indirectly, by attenuating receptor binding, masking antigenic regions of the protein, impeding the activation of the protein precursor HA0 via its cleavage into the disulfidelinked subunits HA1 and HA2, and regulating catalytic activity (Sun et al. 2011; Gallagher and Henneberry 1992) . Generally, H9 viruses vary in the number of glycosylation sites on HA (six in duck viruses and as many as eight in quail and chicken viruses) (Xu et al. 2008) . The glycosylation at position 58 was observed among H5 and H7 viruses isolated from chickens but not from aquatic birds, and it was suggested to be a feature of chicken viruses (Kwon et al. 2006a) . One potential glycosylation site at position 218 (210 in H3) was lost compared with representative reference strains of the G1 lineage, the Y280 lineage, the Korean lineage, and the prototypic Pakistani isolate Ck/Pakistan/2/ 99. Loss of an additional glycosylation site at position 206, compared with the prototype G1 virus A/Qa/HK/G1/97, was observed; this was also seen in H9N2 viruses from the Middle East in 2000-2003. The loss of potential glycosylation sites may represent a selected adaptation of H9N2 within poultry since alteration in glycosylation pattern has been suggested to influence adaptation of avian influenza Table 1 +, glycosylation site present; _, glycosylation site absent viruses to poultry (Iqbal et al. 2009 ). Also, deletion of one amino acid residue at position 298 in TH286 and 492 in TH79 led to the loss of one potential glycosylation site on the HA molecule . Ghadi et al. report a similar deletion in their studies on live bird marketing H9N2 isolates. They suggest that these differences represent mutations that could have occurred in markets; there was no additional glycosylation site that could induce virus virulence (Ghadi et al. 2010) . High similarity in the amino acid sequences in glycosylation sites of these nine isolates provides further evidence of their similar nucleotide sequences. A major determinant of host range is the affinity of the viral HA protein to the sialic acid (SA) receptor of the host cell. A change of preference for the avian influenza virus for a (2, 3)-linked Gal to a (2, 6)-linked Gal for the SA receptor is highly related to host specificity. Wan and Perez (2007) also demonstrated that the Glu to Leu substitution at amino acid position 226 in HA allows H9N2 viruses to replicate more efficiently in human airway epithelial cells cultured in vitro. The substitution of Gln for Leu at residue 226 and the change of Ala to Thr at position 190 occurred in the receptor binding site of those H9N2 variants that have previously been reported to be involved in the binding specificity to receptors in host cells. Therefore, further studies are needed to understand the role of these mutations in the receptor binding site in restricting the host range of these H9N2 variants. These viruses at prevalence might have had the ability of infecting humans without pigs as intermediate hosts, which suggested that H9N2 AIV would become of greater risk to public health in the coming years (Wan and Perez 2007) .",

A study about left edge of binding pocket reveals that three isolates in this study (TH186, TH286, and TH386) have motif that is similar to H9N2 isolates that were isolated from humans. This finding alerts this subject that Iranian isolates have a tendency to infect humans. This kind of motif had been seen in other Iranian isolates that were obtained from Genbank. One chicken isolate (TH85) from Tehran in 2007 contained a Q-234 instead of L-234 in HA1 receptor binding site and thus was not a potential to infect humans. L-234 substation has been seen in some sequences of HA gene of Iranian H9N2 isolates and recently in isolates TH186, TH286, and TH386; thus, these isolates can be bound to human receptors (a-2,6) and may infect human populations. This substitution has been seen in some sequences of HA gene of Iranian H9N2 isolates. Another HA marker, amino acid 198 (receptor binding site) in one isolate, TH286, conserve to new motif in Iranian isolate. Also, the right edge of binding pocket (aa134-138) in Iranian isolates has been detected .Two kinds of motif GTSKA and GTSKS were detected in this study.

According to our results, TH85 (base on bottom of globular head position) and TH78 (based on adjacent receptor binding site) may be originated from ducks. Overall, the presence of H9N2 viruses of the sequence known to bind to human-type receptors in these Iranian poultry and the presence of H9N2 antibodies in the human population of Iran showed that it is possible for circulating H9N2 avian influenza viruses in Iran to infect humans. Hence, extensive surveillance of H9N2 in this country is highly recommended.

It is postulated that, except for some Chinese isolates, the pathogenicity of Iranian isolates seems to be similar to that of other Eurasian isolates . Phylogenetic analysis that was carried out by Homayounimehr showed that all their H9N2 isolates from commercial chickens in Iran (1998 Iran ( -2002 belonged to the G1-like sublineage. On the basis of phylogenetic and molecular characterization evidence, they concluded that the H9N2 subtype influenza viruses circulating in chicken flocks in Iran since 1998-2002 had a common origin (Homayounimehr et al. 2010 ). Ghadi et al. in a molecular surveillance of H9N2 in live bird market report that H9N2 viruses isolated from live bird markets were highly similar to viruses isolated from industrial poultry being circulated as early as 2001. They suggest that a common source of H9N2 viruses is circulating in Iran (Ghadi et al. 2010) . Shahsavandi et al. analyzed the full-length HA genes of 287 H9N2 AI strains isolated from chickens in Asia during the period 1994-2009. They showed that G1-like viruses circulated in the Middle East and Indian subcontinent countries, whereas other sublineages existed in Far East countries. It also revealed G1-like viruses with an average 96.7% identity clustered into two subgroups largely based on their time of isolation (Shahsavandi et al. 2011 (H9N2))] was located in Y-439. A/Garganey/Iran/G8/2003 (H9N2) was isolated from a Garganeyin, the southern part of Iran which was suspected to have been kept together with backyard poultry for a short time before sampling (Fereidouni et al. 2010) .",

            "text": "Our present study has demonstrated that low-pathogenic H9N2 influenza viruses have been permanently circulating in the Middle East region, including Iran, during the last decade. According to a previous report, on the basis of phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the emergence of H9N2 avian influenza infection in Iran originated in Pakistan, and it was due to low quarantine measures in the international boundaries. Due to the high percentage of H9N2 homology isolates of Iran with other isolates, namely A/quail/HongKong/G1, in GenBank and based on published reports for high similarity with infecting human H5N1 isolates, it seems that the potential of Iranian avian influenza isolates to infect human should be considered. Live bird markets as already mentioned are believed to be one of the best environments for keeping avian influenza viruses and transmission between species and productive source for mixing and reassortment of new viruses with higher pathogenicity. It is possible that an elevation in mortality rate under field condition could be caused by coinfection of recent isolates with the bacteria such as Mycoplasma, Escherichia coli, and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale rather than by an emerging pathogenic H9N2 subtype of the virus. The present findings also indicate that the HA genes of the H9 influenza virus circulating in Tehran province were not also well conserved and in recent years have dominant changes. Especially from 2003, a dominant change had been produced in Iranian isolates. Continuous surveillance would improve our understanding of the role of various avian hosts in ecology of influenza viruses and thus the underlying phenomena in emergence of pandemic strains. Also, according to an H5N1 case report in non-industry birds, it is very critical for H9N2 monitoring for probable changes in H9N2 isolates.",
