Natural selection is extremely effective. Extensive genetic heterogeneity has often been found not only among infected individuals during an outbreak, but also within single hosts or even particular tissues. Selection of drug-resistant mutants in vivo during treatment strongly suggests that specific adaptation does occur rapidly, as has been shown in cell culture 8. Obviously, evolution will depend on the environmental conditions under which viral populations replicate. These environmental conditions include, among others, the immune response of the host, antiviral intervention, fever and hormone status. Consequently, effective drug and vaccine development should focus on approaches that induce a broad variety of defenses, so that the probability of generating mutants that can escape all of them (i.e. multiple mutations in a single genome) is minimized.",

Viruses that replicate very rapidly will be more likely to generate and select such mutants during an infection although the immune response clears many millions of infectious particles per day. This occurs with HIV ( Refs 17, 18) . In addition, viruses that can cause immunosupression or establish persistent infection (particularly when they can avoid displaying viral antigens at the cell surface), such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, are difficult to control. Nevertheless, the most important factor that will affect the generation of viable escape mutants is the nature of the virus itself. Thus, different viruses show different antigenic epitopes, and each epitope may or may not tolerate extensive substitutions. Substitutions that confer antibody resistance to some conserved epitopes will be deleterious and escape mutants will be unable to survive selection. This explains the lack of escape mutants for successful RNA virus vaccines such as those for poliovirus, measles and mumps. Conversely, the more variable and adaptable antigenic epitopes in viruses such as FMDV and HIV-1 pose much greater challenges ( Fig. 1) .",

As attenuation may limit, but not prevent, viral replication, the number of sequences that the immune system encounters becomes even more extensive. Most of the successful vaccines against RNA (and DNA) viruses have been live-attenuated viruses, including those used to control poliomyelitis, smallpox, measles, rubella and mumps. Promising results have also been reported for RSV and parainfluenza virus 15. However, the use of these vaccines inevitably involves some risks. Use of live RNA virus always allows some possibility for virulent revertants to arise by mutation and/or by recombination of attenuated precursors, a phenomenon described for poliovirus ~. This problem might be circumvented by developing strains with a very high detrimental mutational load distributed along the genome and, of course, by in-depth knowledge of the factors that contribute to attenuation in vaccinees.",

            "text": "The selection of viral strains to develop a vaccine is a critical, difficult and uncertain enterprise. Cloning of virus from natural isolates, or cell-culture replication of such isolates in the laboratory, is likely to select for sequences that are different from those in circulating strains, either because of random sampling or natural selection (see above). This seems to be happening with HIV vaccines 12. During the preparation of vaccine batches, the enormous ability of RNA viruses to recover fitness (and possibly virulence) during massive replication 5 must always be kept in mind. Studies of vaccine safety must in addition include studies of differences among age/sex/ethnic groups of vaccinees. Simian immunodeficiency virus deletion mutant vaccines developed as a model for HIV (Ref. 21) seem to be safe for adult monkeys, but Ruprecht and co-workers have found that they are not safe for newborn monkeys after mucosal infection n. Another potential problem is the rare mutational generation of genomes that can produce atypical infections or cryptic immunopathological responses, an effect observed for several viruses, including defective measles viruses, causing subacute sclerosing panencephalitis 23. Finally, the potential for inapparent (but damaging) long-term persistent infections and/or proviral DNA integration and host-cell chromosome alterations must be considered. Live vaccines for HIV or hepatitis C virus might have this potential. Some successful vaccination programs will lead to virus eradication but others may leave a fraction of the population susceptible or cryptically infected. For certain viruses, the existence of animal reservoirs can provide a continuous source of infection. Under these circumstances, RNA viruses replicating in susceptible hosts (or vectors) could occasionally generate new antibody-es~pe variants that can infect a previously immune population. A very well-known example of such behavior is the rare production of influenza A virus reassortants (Fig. 2) carrying segments from fowl and human influenza genomes. These include new epitopes that are not recognized by previously induced immune responses in the human population and they initiate human pandemics. This might also occur with a ntt0aber of other RNA viruses 24. Thus, during disease outbreaks, considerable effort must focus on the isolation and characterization of evolving strains involved in the disease process, and vaccine producers should be prepared to 1o replace formulations that may have become less effective . This is acknowledged by the annual review of prevalent viral subtypes included in vaccines against influenza. These need to take into account changes resulting from hypervariability in some epitopes (Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "RNA virus variation is a constant hurdle for the development of effective antiviral drugs. As for vaccine design, drug therapies must deal with the rapid appearance of resistant virus mutants, but, with antiviral drugs, the problem is aggravated. Usually, adequate vaccination will induce an immune response against a variety of epitopes and different variants of each epitope, so that escape mutants must necessarily include multiple appropriate, non-debilitating mutations. Accordingly, their appearance is much less probable. However, most antiviral drugs exert their functions on protein domains that usually involve a very limited number of residues (for example, the catalytic site or contiguous sites of enzymes). The direct consequence is that resistant viruses are often single point mutants, and the probability for rapid takeover by such mutants is high. The use of monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of RNA virus infections is impaired for the same reason. There are several examples in the literature of resistant mutants being isolated after only weeks or even one or two days of antiviral treatment 24. Furthermore, such resistant variants can be present and represent a significant fraction of the quasispecies population even before treatment \"~6. One way to decelerate rapid generation of escape mutants might be to use combination therapies directed toward different steps of the virus life cycle. This might be achieved by the use of antiviral drug cocktails or by the use of drugs with multiple targets. The anti-HIV ribozyme approach developed by Wong-Staal and colleagues 27 might provide one such antiviral therapy if a number of target sequences can be included. Another novel approach might involve attempts toward specific manipulation of RNA virus mutation rates. These are normally within the narrow range that provides optimal biological adaptability (near to the error threshold). Much lower mutation rates could minimize the appearance of mutants resistant to other antivirals, while higher mutation rates would cause the quasispecies to exceed the error threshold and to lose meaningful genetic information (mutational meltdown) 4. Eventually, rational drug design approaches based on knowledge of the structure and function of viral polymerase domains might allow the development of virus-specific mutagenic drugs. Viral kinases are another potential target for design of specific ribonucleotide analogs that can be efficiently phosphorylated only in virus-infected cells. The first widely employed antiviral compound, iododeoxyuridine, was developed in the late 1950s. It is mutagenic due to increased formation of rare tautomers, and abundant viral kinases promote its preferential phosphorylation within herpesvirus-infected cells ~. As we enter the next millenium, specific drugdesign approaches will surely be capable of producing much more specific antivral mutagens. ",

This not only affects the evolution of viral quasispecies in natural hosts, but also provides new opportunities for RNA viruses to expand their diverse quasispecies populations, or even to jump to new niches and new hosts. Novel virus diseases are emerging and more will emerge in the future, as some old ones disappear (and sometimes reappear).
