This study investigated the frequency of hMPV and HCoV-NL63 infections in Swedish children by screening 221 nasopharyngeal aspirates, collected between November 2003 and May 2005, from 212 children attending the paediatric department of a county hospital in Sweden or submitted from local general practitioners. The samples were originally submitted to be tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and were examined retrospectively for hMPV and HCoV-NL63 by RT-PCR. Of the 212 patients, 101 were positive for RSV (48%), 22 (10%) were positive for hMPV, and 12 (6%) were positive for HCoV-NL63. The frequency of HCoV-NL63 infection increased from 1% in 2003-2004 to 10% in 2004-2005. Sequence analysis of parts of the coronavirus genomes showed considerable similarity to the HCoV-NL63 prototype sequence. The study demonstrated that HCoV-NL63 and hMPV occur in south-west Sweden with essentially the same frequency, seasonal distribution and clinical characteristics as have been reported in other countries.",

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbour-joining method of the MEGA program. The nucleotide distance matrix was generated by Kimura's two-parameter estimation [39] . Bootstrap re-sampling (1000 replicates) was used to provide approximate CIs on individual branches. Bootstrap values >70 are indicated. Sequences from several HCoV-NL63 strains that have been submitted previously to GenBank from previous studies (AY46451-AY46458, AY675541-AY675553 and AY66005-AY66010) have been included in the analysis. treated in hospital, while older children are treated at home by general practitioners. Most previous studies have contained a larger proportion of older children, who account for a substantial proportion of HCoV-NL63 infections. The present study contained few samples from children aged >1 year, and only 11 patients were positive for HCoV-NL63 alone, so that comparisons with previous studies are not valid.",

The clinical features in the HCoV-NL63 group in the present study (Table 1 and Table 2 ) were indicative of a lower disease severity than for RSV and hMPV infections.

The replicase gene PCR could be used as a screening tool, but all positive findings should be confirmed by sequencing. The higher sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR in comparison with the two conventional RT-PCRs, together with a more convenient protocol, supports the use of this method as a screening tool.",

The present study observed a similar median age in the group of hMPV-infected children to that in the group of RSV-infected children, as reported also by van den Hoogen et al. [9] . The pathogenicity of hMPV compared with RSV is also a matter for debate. Williams et al. [10] did not observe differences in chest X-ray and hospitalisation rates. Other studies have found lower hospitalisation rates, a shorter duration of symptoms and lower illness scores for hMPV-positive patients [9, 35] . The present study also found evidence of shorter hospitalisation periods with hMPV infection, while the similar rate at which chest X-rays were taken and the low frequency of antibiotic treatment strengthen the observations made by Williams et al. [10] . To determine the incidence and clinical features of HCoV-NL63 and hMPV infection, testing was limited to these two viruses and RSV. Thus, the overall burden of infection caused by respiratory tract pathogens was not investigated, and it is possible that some co-infections with other viruses or bacteria were not detected.",
