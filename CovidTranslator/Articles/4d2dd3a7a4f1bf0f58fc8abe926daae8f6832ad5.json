            "text": "The most common Bartonella species isolated from cats is B. henselae. Less commonly, cats are infected with Bartonella clarridgeiae or Bartonella koehlerae, which also have been linked to human disease. 5, 8 Young cats (\u22641 year) are more likely than older cats to be bacteremic, and stray or feral cats are more likely to be bacteremic than pet cats. 5, 9, 10 Older cats are more likely to be seropositive than young cats, which likely reflects the increased chance of exposure over time. The prevalence of Bartonella bacteremia in cats is also highest in warm, humid climates (e.g., 68% in the Philippines), whereas it is low in colder climates (e.g., 0% in Norway). 5 At least two genotypes of B. henselae infect cats, type Houston-1 (type I) and type Marseille (type II). B. henselae type Marseille predominates among cats in the western United States, western continental Europe, the United Kingdom, and Australia; type Houston-1 is dominant in Asia (Japan and the Philippines). 5 However, within a given country, the prevalence of these types varies among cat populations, and type Houston-1 is more often isolated from humans with bartonellosis, even when type Marseille is more prevalent in the cat population. Some molecular typing methods reveal an even broader genetic diversity among feline strains, and most of the strains that infect humans cluster in a limited number of groups.",

            "text": "Dogs are most commonly infected with Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii or B. henselae. Domestic and wild dogs are thought to be the natural reservoir for B. v. berkhoffii, because B. v. berkhoffii establishes prolonged bacteremia in dogs. In California, 35% of coyotes (Canis latrans) tested were seropositive, and 28% of coyotes from a highly endemic region were bacteremic. 5 Other Bartonella species have also been detected in dogs (see Table 52 -2). Novel species also have been identified in dogs from Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean. [11] [12] [13] Because it is often difficult to culture Bartonella from domestic dog blood, prevalence studies in dogs are usually based on antibody detection. Unfortunately, this correlates poorly with bacteremia. In addition, serologic cross-reactivity occurs among Bartonella species so seroprevalence studies cannot be Bartonella species-specific. The prevalence of antibodies to B. v. berkhoffii in dogs is highest in tropical or subtropical regions. For example, seroprevalences as high as 47% were detected in stray dogs from Morocco. 14 In the southeastern United States, the prevalence of B. henselae antibodies in healthy dogs was 10%; a higher prevalence (27%) was found in sick dogs. 15 Risk factors identified in dogs in the southeastern United States were tick exposure, residence in a rural environment, roaming, and outdoor exposure. 16 The prevalence of B. henselae antibodies in sick dogs from the western United States is less than 2%. 17 ",

            "text": "After infection, Bartonella replicates in erythrocytes and can also infect endothelial cells and bone marrow progenitor cells. 18 It then establishes chronic, often subclinical bacteremia, which can last for weeks, months, or even more than a year and may be a specific adaptation to a mode of transmission by blood-sucking 19 Infection of endothelial cells may be more likely to occur in incidental hosts and appears to be necessary for the development of disorders such as vasculoproliferative disease and endocarditis. Bartonella is thought to cause vasculoproliferative disease via cytokine-induced stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation and inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis. Virulence factors characterized in Bartonella species include adhesins, heme acquisition mechanisms, type IV secretion systems, and a lowpotency lipopolysaccharide, among others. 20 Host immunocompromise, such as due to genetic susceptibility (e.g., breed-related immunodeficiency syndromes), poor nutrition, overcrowding, co-infections with other pathogens, immunosuppressive drug treatment, or defects in normal host barriers (such as congenital valvular disease in dogs with endocarditis), may also influence whether disease ultimately develops in infected dogs and cats. The vast majority of infected dogs and cats show no overt clinical signs of illness when bacteremic. In some situations, disease manifestations that occur in Bartonella spp.-infected dogs and cats are otherwise uncommon to rare and/or known to be associated with Bartonella infection in human patients; organisms may also have been visualized with silver stains using light microscopy in affected tissues (e.g., endocarditis or myocarditis lesions). In other situations, nonspecific clinical signs are present (e.g., uveitis, gingivostomatitis, chylothorax, polyarthritis, chronic rhinitis, idiopathic lower urinary tract disease, lymphadenopathy, reproductive disease, or neurologic disorders), and it has been impossible to clearly assign a role to Bartonella in disease causation. A clear understanding of the role of Bartonella in disease causation has also been thwarted by limitations of diagnostic tests available for detection of infection.",

            "text": "Experimental infections of specific pathogen free cats with Bartonella have shed light on disease processes that can follow infection of cats with Bartonella. Cats infected with B. henselae develop a small papule at the site of inoculation, and transient fever and lymphadenopathy. [21] [22] [23] [24] Transient neurologic signs (such as staring and behavioral abnormalities) and reproductive disorders can also occur. Some cats infected with B. henselae and/or B. clarridgeiae show no clinical signs, and gross lesions are lacking at necropsy. However, histopathology reveals peripheral lymph node hyperplasia, splenic follicular hyperplasia, lymphocytic cholangitis/pericholangitis, lymphocytic hepatitis, lymphoplasmacytic myocarditis, and/or interstitial lymphocytic nephritis. 21, 23 In naturally infected cats, Bartonella can rarely cause endocarditis and myocarditis. Generally speaking, infective endocarditis is rare in cats, but a few of the reported cases have been associated with Bartonella infection. B. henselae DNA has been amplified from aortic valvular vegetative lesions of cats, with visualization of the organism in lesions using silver stains. 25, 26 Dramatic pyogranulomatous myocarditis and diaphragmatic myositis were associated with B. henselae infection in two cats that died in a North Carolina shelter, and organisms were detected in lesions with silver stains and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Figure 52-1) . 27 Carpal and metacarpal osteomyelitis was also associated with a B. v. berkhoffii infection in a cat; Bartonella DNA was detected in bone lesions as well as in the blood. 28 The DNA of B. v. berkhoffii and B. henselae was also detected in cardiac tissues of several cats with systemic reactive angioendotheliomatosis. 29 Bartonella has been investigated for its role in a large number of idiopathic conditions in cats (see Table 52 -3). [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] These include uveitis, 30-32 caudal gingivostomatitis, 32-37 fever of unknown origin, 38 lower urinary tract disease, 32,36,39 chronic kidney disease, 32,36 pancreatitis, 40 lymphadenopathy ( Figure 52 -2), 37 neurologic disease, 32, 41, 42 pododermatitis, 43 and chronic idiopathic rhinosinusitis. 44 There is currently no convincing and repeatable scientific evidence that Bartonella infection causes any of these conditions. Studies have varied in the methodology used to detect infection (serology, culture, and/or PCR assays), and many of the conditions investigated likely have multifactorial etiologies. An understanding of the significance of Bartonella in these conditions will probably require prospective study of large numbers of cats with clearly defined clinical illness using Bartonella culture and/ or PCR assays.",

The most common species identified has been B. v. berkhoffii. In dogs, Bartonella endocarditis usually involves the aortic valve, although the mitral valve is occasionally affected, so the possibility of bartonellosis should not be ruled out in dogs with mitral valve endocarditis. Dogs with Bartonella endocarditis are more likely to be afebrile and more likely to have congestive heart failure than dogs with other causes of endocarditis, and their median survival time is shorter (Figure 52 -3). 61 Complications of Bartonella endocarditis include thromboembolic disease and neutrophilic polyarthritis.",

Based on case reports and seroprevalence studies, Bartonella is suspected to cause polyarthritis, epistaxis, thrombocytopenia, and/or splenomegaly in dogs. 17 However, these associations could also reflect the presence of other detected or undetected, co-transmitted vector-borne pathogens that cause these disorders. Bartonella has been investigated for its role in canine lymphoma 62 ; neurologic disease 63 ; splenic disorders including lymphoid nodular hyperplasia, hemangiosarcoma, and fibrohistiocytic nodules 64 ; idiopathic cavitary effusion 65 ; and idiopathic rhinitis. 66 As for cats, the role that Bartonella plays in these conditions, if any, is unclear and requires further study.",

Physical examination findings in cats with Bartonella endocarditis or myocarditis have included fever, lethargy, respiratory distress, cardiac murmurs, and arrhythmias. 26, 27 Diagnosis Diagnosis of bartonellosis is based on the presence of consistent clinical abnormalities (especially endocarditis or myocarditis, but also other systemic inflammatory or vasculoproliferative diseases), histopathologic findings, and positive culture or PCR FIGURE 52-2 Lymph node of a 1-year-old, retrovirus-negative, flea-ridden cat with a 3-month history of fever, mild lethargy, and generalized peripheral lymphadenopathy but a normal appetite. The right axillary and both mandibular lymph nodes measured 3 cm in diameter; the remaining peripheral lymph nodes were 2 cm in diameter. A serum chemistry profile revealed hyperglobulinemia (6.5 g/dL). Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a polyclonal gammopathy. Histopathology of the right axillary, right mandibular and right popliteal lymph node showed lymphofollicular hyperplasia and marked neutrophilic, lymphocytic, and histiocytic capsulitis and perilymphadenitis. Note the florid capsulitis to the right of the arrows, which indicate the outer extent of the lymph node parenchyma. Silver stains (Warthin-Starry and Steiner stains) showed a small amount of granular staining within cells, which possibly represented intracellular agyrophilic bacteria. The DNA of Bartonella henselae and Bartonella clarridgeiae was detected in the lymph node using PCR, and blood cultures were positive for B. henselae. Interestingly, the cat was seronegative to B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. assay results on blood and affected tissues (Table 52-4) . It may be impossible to identify Bartonella as the cause of disease if the organism is detected only in the blood and if affected tissues (e.g., valvular vegetations) cannot be obtained for analysis, because healthy dogs and especially cats can be bacteremic.",

            "text": "Cats are the major reservoirs for B. henselae, the principal cause of CSD in immunocompetent humans. CSD is characterized by formation of a pustule at the site of inoculation (a cat scratch) within 14 days, followed by development of local lymphadenopathy and malaise 1 to 3 weeks after the scratch (or bite), which can persist for weeks to months. Most cases of CSD are self-limiting after several months and respond minimally to antimicrobial drug treatment. Occasionally CSD is complicated by other disorders such as encephalopathy, relapsing bacteremia, osteomyelitis, neuroretinitis, or endocarditis, which require antimicrobial drug treatment. Vasculoproliferative diseases such as bacillary peliosis (e.g., peliosis hepatis) and bacillary angiomatosis ( Figure 52-7) are among the most common complications in immunocompromised humans. 20 Young cats are most often implicated in transmission to humans, because young cats are more likely to be bacteremic than older cats. Dogs are less likely to act as reservoirs for human disease when compared with cats, because the prevalence of Bartonella infection and the magnitude of bacteremia in dogs are lower than that in cats. Nevertheless, dogs have occasionally been implicated in transmission of Bartonella to humans through bite wounds or scratches, and to date, all Bartonella species identified in sick dogs are also pathogenic or potentially pathogenic in humans. Immunocompromised humans should preferably choose adult, well-socialized cats over kittens as pets and should be properly educated in regard to the need for flea prevention. Cats' claws should be trimmed regularly, but there is no evidence that declawing prevents transmission. Animal scratches or bites should be avoided, and if they occur, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water, after which prompt medical attention should be sought. The Guidelines for Preventing Opportunistic Infections among HIV-Infected Persons (United States Public Health Service and Infectious Diseases Society of America) state \"No evidence indicates any benefits to cats or their owners from routine culture or serologic testing of the pet for Bartonella infection.\" 78 There is also no antimicrobial drug treatment that reliably eliminates bacteremia from cats, and administration of antimicrobial drugs to cats may result in unnecessary bites, scratches, and contact with cat saliva. Pros and cons for the testing of healthy cats for Bartonella infection are shown in Box 52-2. 67 Bartonella has the potential to be transmitted to veterinarians as a result of scratches or bite wounds as well as needlestick injuries. 79, 80 Because of the high prevalence of Bartonella bacteremia in stray and young cats, veterinarians should take care to avoid these injuries (consider use of sedation whenever possible if necessary), thoroughly wash wounds that occur, and seek medical attention early if necessary. Gloves should be worn if skin contact with animal blood or saliva is anticipated.",

Treatment: Pesto was treated with l-lysine (500 mg PO q12h), for possible FHV-1 infection, and doxycycline (10 mg/kg PO q24h, immediately followed by a bolus of water), for possible chlamydiosis or mycoplasmosis.

Abdo minal ultrasound showed persistent abdominal lymphadenomegaly. Cytologic examination of an ultrasound-guided aspirate of a mesenteric lymph node revealed mild to moderate lymphoid reactivity. Plasma cells were increased in number and were admixed throughout the specimen with rare mast cells and eosinophils. Low numbers of vacuolated macrophages and nondegenerate neutrophils were also observed. RT-PCR for feline coronavirus RNA on the lymph node aspirate was negative. IFA serology for antibodies to B. clarridgeiae was negative, whereas serology for antibodies to B. henselae was positive at 1:64. B. henselae was cultured from the blood. Treatment was changed from doxycycline to azithromycin, and again there was mild improvement in Pesto's attitude. However, several days later the cat became lethargic again, and her appetite decreased further. Comments: Bartonella infection in this cat was initially suspected because of fever and lymphadenopathy, and infection with B. henselae was confirmed with Bartonella culture. Ultimately, an alternate diagnosis (FIP) was made based on the presence of the combination of marked hyperglobulinemia, a very high feline coronavirus titer, and histopathology of a mesenteric lymph node and IHC for coronavirus antigen. There was also minimal response to antimicrobial drugs with activity against Bartonella. Thus, the Bartonella bacteremia was an incidental finding. Bartonella bacteremia was detected in the face of doxycycline treatment, which highlights the fact that antimicrobial drug treatment does not always clear bacteremia. The cat was fractious and the owner could not effectively administer the l-lysine twice daily, but assured the veterinarian that Pesto had received the doxycycline. The owner may have been exposed to Bartonella during treatment. Treatment with azithromycin was followed by a single negative culture, but antibody titers increased, so the Bartonella infection may have been relatively recent.",

Since obtained as a kitten, she had shown intermittent signs of upper respiratory tract disease, characterized by sneezing, serous to mucopurulent nasal and ocular discharges, inappetence, blepharospasm, tachypnea, and a cough, for which she had been treated with amoxicillin or doxycycline on at least three separate occasions. Between episodes she appeared healthy, but she had always been thin. There had been no vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in thirst or urination. Pesto was obtained as a stray kitten, tested negative for FeLV and FIV, and had been housed indoors ever since. She was neutered at 8 months of age without complication. Five months earlier, she traveled briefly to Oregon with the owner. She lived with a dog and a retrovirus-negative kitten that was introduced 5 months ago. One other sibling had died of FIP, which was confirmed on necropsy. Pesto was up to date on vaccinations for respiratory viruses, panleukopenia virus, and rabies. She was not receiving any medications.Body Weight: 2.9 kg. General: Quiet, alert, responsive, and hydrated. T = 103\u00b0F (39.5\u00b0C), HR = 240 beats/min, RR = 40 breaths/minute, moist and pink mucous membranes, CRT <2 s. Integument: No ectoparasites were noted. The haircoat was full and lustrous.Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat:In the left eye, mild conjunctivitis with moderate serous ocular discharge was Continued present. Mild corneal opacity was present in the right eye. No abnormalities detected on examination of the oral cavity. There was no evidence of nasal discharge or abnormal nasal airflow.All Other Systems:No clinically significant abnormalities were detected. A full neurologic examination was not performed. Examination: Pesto behaved as if visual and was relatively comfortable with mild blepharospasm. The menace response, palpebral reflexes, and pupillary light reflexes were normal. There was no evidence of eyelid abnormalities or episcleral or conjunctival injection. Mild chemosis was present bilaterally. There was no aqueous flare, the lenses were normal, and a fundic examination was normal. The dorsal third of the right cornea had superficial vessels that extended from the limbus and a 2-to 3-mm central area where ghost vessels were present, which may have represented a previous dendritic ulcer. A rose Bengal stain was negative for ulceration.Thoracic Radiographs: No clinically significant abnormalities were noted. Ultrasound: Lymph nodes were moderately enlarged throughout the abdomen, including the gastric, splenic, and jejunal nodes. Hepatic and sublumbar nodes were enlarged to a lesser degree. The echotexture of the enlarged nodes was homogeneous. The left adrenal gland was moderately enlarged, measuring 0.66 cm in thickness. The right adrenal gland could not be differentiated from multiple enlarged nodes. No free fluid was identified. Testing: In-clinic FeLV antigen and FIV antibody ELISA assay: Negative. Feline coronavirus serum antibody IFA assay: Positive at 1:25,600.",

IFA serology and culture for Bartonella were repeated and showed a titer of 1:1024 to B. clarridgeiae and 1:4096 to B. henselae; Bartonella spp. culture was negative. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of an enlarged mesenteric lymph node was obtained. Histopathology showed a mixed, dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Some of the macrophages present stained positive using immunohistochemistry for feline coronavirus antigen.
