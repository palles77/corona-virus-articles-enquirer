The role of HBoV in pathogenesis, however, is largely unknown, and little is known about the epidemiology of the virus. To study the seroepidemiology of HBoV infection, the capsid protein was expressed in insect cells. Expression of the putative major capsid protein VP2 in insect cells led to the formation of virus-like particles exhibiting the typical icosahedral appearance of parvoviruses with a diameter of approximately 20 nm. The expressed particles were used to establish an ELISA method, and serum samples from groups of children of various ages in China were tested for IgG antibodies against HBoV. HBoV antibodies were detected in as high as 36% of healthy children under 9 years. Of children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections, 31% were seropositive, and all age groups of these children showed a significantly higher level of HBoV IgG antibody than their healthy counterparts. When divided into age cohorts, results showed that more than 48% of healthy children had seroconverted by age of 4. Thus, HBoV appears to be a common infection in children. The potential pathogenesis of this virus, especially its role in lower respiratory tract infections in children warrants further investigation.",

HBoV appears to be associated with lower respiratory tract infections, and in many cases, co-infection with other respiratory viruses (Allander et al., 2007; Fry et al., 2007) . The frequency of detection suggests that HBoV is less common than respiratory syncytial virus and probably also rhinoviruses in infants with respiratory illnesses. However, the virus is approximately as common as influenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 3, and adenoviruses and is probably more common than coronaviruses and the other parainfluenza viruses (McIntosh K, 2006) .",

Currently, detection of human bocavirus in children with lower respiratory tract infections relies on DNA amplification by PCR, however, PCR assays do not reflect the course of HBoV infection. Therefore, a method to detect HBoV infection in a large scale is required to diagnose and characterize the role of HBoV in human disease. Purified HBoV proteins are needed to develop an accurate and efficient enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to help characterize potential HBoV etiology of lower respiratory tract infections.",

A concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg/ml in 100 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6, was determined to develop an OD value of approximately 1.0 at 450 nm with two strong reactive serum (Serum #2 and #17) at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS (Fig. 4A) . Serum #2 and #17 were also confirmed to be strongly reactive with the VP2 protein by immunoblot (Fig 4B, lanes 1 and 2) . Next, ELISAs were performed on serially diluted sera from selected healthy blood donors. The test produced typical ELISA curves with an end point (with an OD value below 0.2 at 1:400 dilution for negative sera and 1:6400 for positive sera) (Fig. 4A) . The presumed negative serum #13 and #14 were also confirmed to be so by immunoblot (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4) .

No significant difference between these conditions was detected for any of the 20 samples tested (Table 1 ). The higher pH buffer of 100mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6 may have been able to disassemble VLPs (Wang et al., 2005) , and thus more antigenic epitopes may have been exposed. For this reason, in order to be as inclusive as possible, we chose the high pH buffer (100mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6) to use for our large-scale analysis. To determine the specificity of the assay, the purified bovine bocavirus BPV (a gift from Dr. F. Brent Johnson) (Johnson et al., 2004 ) was coated at a concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg/ml. All these tested sera showed very low OD values (under 0.14), indicating that IgG antibodies in these positive sera (#2, 10, 16 and 17) were specific for the HBoV VP2 antigen (Table 1) .",

In the group of healthy children over 9 years of age, nearly half (48%) had apparently been previously infected with this virus, as the level of IgG antibody was high in this group (Fig. 5B) .

This ELISA showed specificity for the HBoV VP2 protein; no cross-reactivity was observed with the closely-related bovine Bocavirus BPV capsid. This is the first report to demonstrate that the HBoV VP2 protein is capable of forming VLPs, and the second to show the presence of HBoV specific IgG antibody in human sera. Importantly, a significantly higher level of HBoV IgG antibody in relative age groups of children with acute respiratory infection was found compared with that of children without acute respiratory infection, suggesting that HBoV may be an agent causing or playing a role in acute respiratory infection in children. Nevertheless, characterization of the presence of IgM antibody or IgG in double serum samples is required in subsequent studies for precisely evaluating the status of infection of HBoV in acute respiratory infection. In addition, a high positive rate of HBoV IgG antibody in sera from healthy U.S. blood donors (aged 18-65 years) was observed in this study, indicating HBoV infection is widespread in the U.S.. Together, these results also indicate that HBoV is likely first encountered in childhood, which is consistent with previous suggestions (Allander et al., 2005; Arnold et al., 2006; Bastien et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2006; Foulongne et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2006; Qu et al., 2007; Sloots et al., 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006) . Empty VP2 VLPs of B19 have been used effectively as antigen in ELISAs for evaluating B19 antibodies (Soderlund et al., 1995) . The capsid formed by HBoV VP2 protein, which appears to be a characteristic icosahedral parvoviral particle, was used as antigen for detecting IgG to HBoV in this study. Different coating buffers were compared in initial optimization of the ELISA. Because no significant difference in the reactivity to serum samples was observed, a high pH (pH9.6) was used as a standard coating buffer. While HBoV VLPs might be denatured in this high pH buffer system (Wang et al., 2005) , for human B19 IgG antibody studies, results from conformational antigen (capsid) or denatured VP1 and VP2 proteins did not show a significant difference (94.6% vs. 89.5%) (Manaresi et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "In this study, a relatively lower HBoV IgG-positive rate of approximately 15% was observed in healthy children younger than 24 months, and this rate increased to approximately 42% for healthy children older than 3 years of age. The relatively lower positive rate in our study, compared to that of the Japanese group could be explained if the immuofluorescence assay used by the Japanese group also detected HBoV specific IgM in the tested sera (Endo et al., 2007) . For children clinically diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infections in the study presented here, HBoV IgG seroprevalence rates were as follows: 22% in children younger than 12 months of age, 31% in children 1-2 years of age, and 60% in children 3 years of age. However, a high level of IgG was observed in positive sera from the children with lower respiratory tract infections [11% (18/161) had an OD value of higher than 0.8]. Either reinfection or acute infection of HBoV may have occurred, and HBoV may have been the causative agent for lower respiratory tract infections in these children. Only 5 of 161 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples (3.1%) from these children showed a significant level of HBoV genome (6.6\u00d710 3 \u22122.6\u00d710 6 gc/ml). Interestingly, all of these 5 children were hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections and had a significant IgG antibody titer (OD>0.4); 3 of them had a high IgG antibody titer (OD>0.7), which suggested acute infection of HBoV. HBoV co-infection with other respiratory viruses (Allander et al., 2007; Fry et al., 2007) has been found in many cases, therefore, the role of HBoV in lower respiratory tract infections is unclear. This study was designed initially to probe the independent pathogenesis of HBoV in lower respiratory tract infections. A high level of IgG (11% had an OD value of higher than 0.8) in positive sera from children with lower respiratory tract infections suggests, but certainly does not prove, that HBoV may cause infection independently.",

Infection with B19 occurs in children in a high incidence asymptomatically. Specific IgG antibodies appear several days after IgM and persist for years. Seropositivity to B19 (IgG) has been shown to reach 80% in healthy European blood donors (Gallinella et al., 2003) . Thus, infection with HBoV might also occur widely. A high seroprevalence in healthy children and adults suggests that most HBoV infections do not require medical attention in children.",

This parvoviral like particle did not hemagglutinate human \"O\" type red blood cells unlike the bovine bocavirus BPV. An ELISA based on these VLPs was established for detection of IgG antibody against HBoV in sera. A significant difference in serum reactivity to HBoV VLPs was observed; a high percentage with higher OD values were present in sera from children hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections compared with sera from healthy children. Therefore, this VLPs-based ELISA was appropriate for early diagnosis of HBoV infection and for further study of the virus and its infection in children with lower respiratory tract infections. In addition, HBoV VLPs have the potential to be used in the future for vaccine development.",
