            "text": "DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are promising epigenetic targets for the development of novel anticancer drugs and other diseases. Molecular modeling and experimental approaches are being used to identify and develop inhibitors of human DNMTs. Most of the computational efforts conducted so far with DNMT1 employ homology models of the enzyme. Recently, a crystallographic structure of the methyltransferase domain of human DNMT1 bound to unmethylated DNA was published. Following on our previous computational and experimental studies with DNMTs, we herein present molecular dynamics of the crystal structure of human DNMT1. Docking studies of established DNMT1 inhibitors with the crystal structure gave rise to a structure-based pharmacophore model that suggests key interactions of the inhibitors with the catalytic binding site. Results had a good agreement with the docking and pharmacophore models previously developed using a homology model of the catalytic domain of DNMT1. The docking protocol was able to distinguish active DNMT1 inhibitors from, for example, experimentally known inactive DNMT1 inhibitors. As part of our efforts to identify novel inhibitors of DNMT1, we conducted the experimental characterization of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) that in preliminary docking studies showed promising activity. ATA had a sub-micromolar inhibition (IC 50 = 0.68 M) against DNMT1. ATA was also evaluated for Dnmt3a inhibition showing an IC 50 = 1.4 M. This chapter illustrates the synergy from integrating molecular modeling and experimental methods for further advance the discovery of novel candidates for epigenetic therapies.",

            "text": "The genome contains genetic and epigenetic information. While the genome provides the blueprint for the manufacture of all the proteins required to create a living thing, the epigenetic information provides instruction on how, where, and when the genetic information should be used (Robertson, 2001) . The major form of epigenetic information within the DNA molecule itself in mammalian cells is DNA methylation, that is the covalent addition of a methyl group to the 5-position of cytosine, mostly within the CpG dinucleotides in somatic cells (Robertson, 2001) . DNA methylation is involved in the control of gene expression, regulation of parental imprinting and stabilization of X chromosome inactivation as well as maintenance of the genome integrity. It is also implicated in the development of the immune system, cellular reprogramming and brain function and behaviour (Jurkowska et al., 2011) . DNA methylation is mediated by a family of DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs). In mammals, three DNMTs have been identified so far in the human genome, including the two de novo methyltransferases (DNMT3A and DNMT3B) and the maintenance methyltransferase (DNMT1), which is generally the most abundant and active of the three (Robertson, 2001; Yokochi and Robertson, 2002; Goll and Bestor, 2005) . DNMT1 is responsible for duplicating patterns of DNA methylation during replication and is essential for mammalian development and cancer cell growth (Chen et al., 2007) . These enzymes are key regulators of gene transcription, and their roles in carcinogenesis have been the subject of considerable interest over the last decade (Robertson, 2001; Jones and Baylin, 2007) . Therefore, specific inhibition of DNA methylation is an attractive and novel approach for cancer therapy (Robertson, 2001; Lyko and Brown, 2005; Portela and Esteller, 2010; Kelly et al., 2010) . DNA methylation inhibitors have also emerged as a promising strategy for the treatment of immunodeficiency and brain disorders (Zawia et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Human DNMT1 is a protein with 1616 amino acids whose structure can be divided into an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain (Cheng and Blumenthal, 2008; Lan et al., 2010; Jurkowska et al., 2011) . The mechanism of DNA cytosine-C5 methylation is schematically depicted in Fig. 1 (Vilkaitis et al., 2001; Schermelleh et al., 2005; Sippl and Jung, 2009 ). DNMT forms a complex with DNA and the cytosine which will be methylated flips out from the DNA. The thiol of the catalytic cysteine acts as a nucleophile that attacks the 6-position of the target cytosine to generate a covalent intermediate. The 5-position of the cytosine is activated and conducts a nucleophilic attack on the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet/SAM) to form the 5-methyl covalent adduct and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy/SAH). The attack on the 6-position is assisted by a transient protonation of the cytosine ring at the endocyclic nitrogen atom N3, which is stabilized by a glutamate residue. An arginine residue may participate in the stabilization of the intermediate making a hydrogen bonding interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of cytosine. The covalent complex between the methylated base and the DNA is resolved by deprotonation at the 5-position to generate the methylated cytosine and the free enzyme.",

The N-terminal domain guides the nuclear localization of the enzymes and mediates their interactions with other proteins, DNA, and chromatin. The smaller C-terminal domain harbors the active center of the enzyme and contains ten amino acids motifs diagnostic for all carbon-5 DNMTs (Jurkowska et al., 2011) . The catalytic domain has a core structure shared by all DNA MTases. This core structure is termed the \"AdoMet-dependent MTase fold\" and consists of a six-stranded parallel sheet with a seventh strand inserted in a parallel fashion between the fifth and sixth strands. Six helices are folded around the central sheet. Motifs I and X of this domain are involved in the cofactor binding. Motifs IV, VI and VIII are involved in catalysis. The target recognition domain (TRD) is a nonconserved region between motifs VIII and IX that is involved in DNA recognition and specificity ( Fig.  2) (Jeltsch, 2002; Jurkowska et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Three-dimensional structural information for human DNMT1 is limited. Just recently a crystal structure of human DNMT1 bound to duplex DNA containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CG) sites was published (Song et al., 2011) . However the conformation of the crystal structure is in an 'inactive state' (the target base from DNA is not flipped out) so that the geometry of the catalytic site does not reflect the catalytic mechanism. Further details of the structure of DNMTs and other available crystal structures of DNMTs are extensively reviewed elsewhere (Cheng and Blumenthal, 2008; Sippl and Jung, 2009; Lan et al., 2010) . DNA methylation inhibitors have been well characterized and tested in clinical trials (Issa and Kantarjian, 2009) . To date, only 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine (decitabine) have been developed clinically. These two drugs are nucleoside analogues, which, after incorporation into DNA, cause covalent trapping and subsequent depletion of DNA methyltransferases (Schermelleh et al., 2005; Stresemann and Lyko, 2008) . Aza nucleosides are approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, where they demonstrate significant, although usually transient improvement in patient survival and are currently being tested in many solid cancers (Issa et al., 2005; Schrump et al., 2006) . However, aza nucleosides have relatively low specificity and are characterized by substantial cellular and clinical toxicity (Stresemann and Lyko, 2008) . Their exact mechanism of antitumor action also remains unclear (Issa, 2005; Palii et al., 2008; Fandy et al., 2009) . Consequently, there is clear need to identify novel and more specific DNMT inhibitors that do not function via incorporation into DNA.",

Due to the absence of a crystallographic structure of human DNMT1 that was published until recently (Song et al., 2011) , molecular modeling studies into the catalytic binding site of DNMTs had been conducted using homology models Herein, we describe docking studies of known DNMT1 inhibitors in the catalytic site of the recently published crystal structure of DNMT1 (Song et al., 2011) . Prior docking, the conformation of the catalytic site was modeled into an active conformation using molecular dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular modeling study conducted with the catalytic binding site of the crystal structure of human DNMT1. Based on the docking results, we developed a structure-based pharmacophore model of DNMT1 inhibitors. In an effort to identify novel non-nucleoside DNMT1 inhibitors, we also report the experimental activity of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) that showed sub-micromolar inhibition against DNMT1. Molecular modeling studies of ATA with the catalytic site of the crystal structure of DNMT1 are also discussed.",

            "text": "The recently published X-ray crystal structure of human DNMT1 corresponds to the enzyme bound to DNA-containing unmethylated CpG sites. In this structure, the catalytic loop has an open conformation such as the catalytic cysteine is far away from the binding site. Therefore, the geometry of the catalytic site of the crystal structure does not represent the active conformation of the enzyme that corresponds to the catalytic mechanism of DNA methylation. In contrast, in the x-ray structure of bacterial M.HhaI (Klimasauskas et al., 1994; Kumar et al., 1997) and in our previously developed homology model (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b) , the DNA is embedded in the catalytic core and the catalytic loops are also close to the inserted target cytosine in the active site (Fig. 3) . We therefore used molecular dynamics to model the crystal structure of the human DNMT1-DNA into an active state. To this end, the crystal structure of the DNMT1-DNA complex with bound AdoHcy was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 3PTA). The unmethylated DNA and other domains, except the methyltransferase domain, were removed. The DNA double helix reconstructed from the structure of M.HhaI (PDB: 1MHT) (Klimasauskas et al., 1994) , in the catalytic core, and target cytosine inserted into the active site. The missing residues (1480-1483) were modeled using Prime (version 2.2, Schr\u00f6dinger LLC, New York, NY, 2010). The refined model was treated according to the Protein Preparation Wizard implemented in Maestro, which optimizes H-bond networks and flip orientations/tautomeric states of Gln, Asn, and His residues, and performed a geometry optimization to a maximum root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.3\u00c5 with OPLS2005 force field. We have recently employed a similar procedure to prepare the structure of other proteins (Hern\u00e1ndez-Campos et al., 2010) . The stability of the refined model was probed by an MD simulation using MacroModel (version 9.8, Schr\u00f6dinger LLC, New York, NY, 2010) . A Stochastic Dynamics (SD) method was used with the OPLS force field and implicit water solvation under the following conditions: (a) equilibration time 1.0 ps at 300 K; (b) 100 ps of simulation time at 300 K; (c) time steps = 1.5 fs; and (d) 100 conformations stored. To make a direct comparison of the energy of the conformers obtained by SD, the collection of SD conformations was submitted to a multi minimization step with the Polak-Ribiere Conjugate Gradient (PRCG). Convergence in the SD simulation was judged complete by the rootmean-square (RMS) deviation of the 100 stored structures and the interaction between key amino acid residues and target cytosine. Fig. 4 shows the conformation of the modified X-ray structure with the catalytic loop in an active conformation. Although the RMSD of the C atoms of the initial and modified X-ray structure is 1.92 \u00c5, the catalytic loop of the modified structure adopts a different conformation with respect to the X-ray structure. In the X-ray structure, the distance of superimposed target cytosine C6 to the sulfur atom of Cys1226 in the catalytic loop is 9.5 \u00c5 (Fig. 4d ). In contrast, the catalytic loop of the modified structure is located above the cytosine as an 'active site lid'. The target cytosine lies between the nucleophile Cys1226 and sulfur atom of AdoHcy. The distance of cytosine C6 to the sulfur atom of Cys1226 is 3.4 \u00c5, and cytosine C5 atom is 3.5 \u00c5 away from the sulfur atom of AdoHcy. In addition, the N3 protonated form of cytosine can make hydrogen bond with the acidic side chain of Glu1266, Pro1224, Arg1310, and Arg1312 (Fig. 4e ). The -phosphate backbone of deoxycytidine makes a hydrogen bond network with Arg1312, Ser1230, Gly1231, and Lys1535. In addition, the 3 -OH of the sugar moiety forms hydrogen bonds with Thr1528 and Gly1577. Interestingly, the key interactions with Glu1266 in the ENV motif, Arg1312 in the RXR motif, Ser1230 and Gly1231 in the catalytic loop are observed in the homology model (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b) . The catalytic cores of the modified crystal structure and homology model of DNMT1 (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b) have similar conformation of the catalytic loop. These insights suggest that the modified structure and homology model are reliable to explore the binding mode of inhibitors of human DNMT1.",

Also, and more importantly in this case, we seek to explore the putative binding site of established inhibitors into the catalytic binding site using the crystallographic structure of DNMT1.",

            "text": "To conduct the docking, the chemical structures of the 35 compounds were built in Maestro 9.1 (Schr\u00f6dinger LLC, New York, NY, 2010) and minimized with the OPLS2005 force field and gradient termination at 0.001 kJ/mol-\u00c5 (Macromodel) . Ligands were prepared with conformational search in MacroModel and LigPrep (version 2.4, Schr\u00f6dinger LLC, New York, NY, 2010) to generate all the possible configurations (LigPrep). The conformational analysis was carried out with Monte Carlo Multiple Minimum and Low-Mode conformational search method, employing the OPLS force field using GB/SA water solvation model. The lowest energy conformation of each ligand was docked with the x-ray structure modified to an active conformation (see above) using the program Glide (version 5.6, Schr\u00f6dinger LLC, New York, NY, 2010). Our group has successfully used Glide to develop binding models of inhibitors of DNMTs (Kuck et al., 2010a; Kuck et al., 2010b; Caulfield and Medina-Franco, 2011; Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b; Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011c) . Three flexible docking methods, including highthroughput virtual screening (HTVS), standard-precision (SP), and extra-precision (XP) implemented in Glide were used for comparison. For each method, a receptor grid box of 23 \u00c5 on each side, with a default inner box (10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00c5 3 ), was centered on the target cytosine. Input partial charges were used and no constrains were applied during docking. In the case of the HTVS and SP docking methods, one pose per ligand was intended for large database screening applications, and 10 poses per ligand for XP docking method was set to optimize more precise poses of the top-scoring ligands by HTVS and SP docking. The postdocking minimization was applied to investigate their effect on the accuracy in the three docking protocols: five docking poses per ligand were minimized for HTVS and SP, and 10 poses per ligand for XP. The best docking poses of XP docking were selected to generate the pharmacophore features (see below). Table 1 summarizes the results of docking into the catalytic site of the crystal structure using Glide HTVS, SP, and XP. For comparison the docking scores obtained using the previously reported homology model of DNMT1 (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b ) are shown. The docking results were able to predict energetically favorable binding modes with accurate scoring of docking conformations. Docking results with Glide HTVS and SP with the modified crystal structure and homology model showed significant impact on ranking score with remarkable consistency as shown in graph of the Table 1. In the docking results of HTVS and SP, the ranking of active and inactive have similar variations. Almost all active compounds have more stable energy values than inactives. Of note, all known inhibitors except procaine and procainamide ranked higher than decoys. Nucleoside inhibitors including 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine (decitabine) showed the best Glide XP docking scores using the modified crystallographic and homology models. It is clear from these studies that optimal docking and scoring combination will decrease the number of false positive and false negatives in virtual screening. Fig. 6 shows the corresponding binding mode of selected DNMT inhibitors generated with Glide XP into the catalytic binding site of the modified crystal structure. The binding modes of nucleoside inhibitors closely match with the target cytidine. The -phosphate of 5azacytidine and zebularine makes a hydrogen bond network with Ser1230 and Gly1231 in the catalytic loop, with Lys1535 in the target recognition domain (TRD), and Arg1312. The ribose groups form additional hydrogen bonds with Thr1528, Gly1577, and Asn1578. The target base of most nucleoside inhibitors make key interactions with the conserved glutamate residue in the ENV motif (motif IV: E/Glu1266, N/Asn1267, V/Val1268) and arginine residues in the RXR motif (motif VIII: R/Arg1310, X/1311, R/Arg1312), and Pro1224. Although zebularine does not form hydrogen bonds with Glu1266 and Pro1224 (due to the fact zebularine lacks of the amino group at the C4 position), the distance of 3.7\u00c5 between Cys1226 and C6 is sufficient to start the catalytic mechanism. In addition, the N3 of zebularine and O 1 of Glu1266 are in an available hydrogen bonding distance for N3 protonation (Fig. 6) . These observations are in agreement with the docking poses in the catalytic site of homology model of hDNMT1 (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b) . In the homology model, nucleoside inhibitors make hydrogen bond networks with common key amino acid residues, Pro1223, Glu1265 Arg1311, Ser1229 and Gly1230. The RMSD values of the top scored poses of nucleoside inhibitors between modified crystal structure and homology are less than 1.0 \u00c5. These comparisons shows that similar binding modes were obtained in the crystal structure modeled to an active state and the previously generated homology model of hDNMT1. Therefore, these results suggest that both models of DNMT1 are useful for scoring and pose selection for virtual screening. In the next few paragraphs, we describe in more detail the binding mode of representative inhibitors of DNMT1 into the catalytic site of the crystal structure of human DNMT1 modeled into an active conformation.",

            "text": "For 16 established DNMT inhibitors in Fig. 4a we developed an energy-optimized pharmacophore (e-pharmacophore) hypothesis using the best scoring pose for each compound and descriptors calculated with Glide XP. We employed the structure-based pharmacophore approach that we previously used to model DNMT inhibitors using a homology model of the catalytic site (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b) . This approach is based on mapping the energetic terms from the Glide XP scoring function onto atom centers and has the advantage of combining pharmacophore perception with protein-ligand energetic terms to rank the importance of the pharmacophore features (Salam et al., 2009 ). The docking models of the inhibitors were refined using Glide XP, the Glide XP scoring terms were computed, and the energies were mapped into atoms. Then, the pharmacophoric sites were automatically generated with Phase (v3.2, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2010) using the default set of six chemical features: namely, hydrogen bond acceptor (A), hydrogen bond donor (D), hydrophobic (H), negative ionizable (N), positive ionizable (P), and aromatic ring (R) site. The Glide XP energies from the atoms that comprise each pharmacophoric site were summed. The pharmacophoric sites were then ranked based on the summed energies, and the most favorable sites were selected for the pharmacophore hypothesis (Salam et al., 2009 ). These features were used to develop a common pharmacophore model that was evaluated on its ability to reproduce known inhibitors using Phase. The distance matching tolerance was set to 2.0 \u00c5. To account for protein flexibility and lessen the effects of minor steric clashes, excluded volumes spheres were created for all receptor atoms within 5 \u00c5 around each ligand. Each sphere has a radius corresponding to 50% of the van der Waals radius of the receptor atom. Receptor atoms less than 1.5 \u00c5 from the ligand were ignored. The combination of best-scoring features that matched a minimum of two sites in each known inhibitor was chosen and regenerated (Salam et al., 2009 ). Fig. 7a shows the five-feature pharmacophore model for the 16 DNMT1 inhibitors. The energetic value and amino acid residues participating in the interaction are shown in the figure. The best-scoring feature is a negative charge (N) which is close to the side chains of Ser1230, Gly1231, Lys1535, and Arg1312. The second and third favorable features are a donor site (D) that is near the side chain of Gly1577, and an acceptor site (A) that is in close proximity to the side chain of Arg1310 and Arg1312 in the RXR motif. The fourth ranked feature is an aromatic ring (R) that stabilizes the binding conformations of ligands between AdoHcy and Cys1226. The fifth ranked feature is a donor site (D) that is near the side chain of Glu1266, which is a residue implicated in the mechanism of methylation (Fig. 7a) . These pharmacophore features represent the most important interactions of the 16 DNMT1 inhibitors with the catalytic site. Notably, glutamate in the ENV motif and the arginines in the RXR motif are highly conserved residues in catalytic domains of DNMTs (Jurkowska et al., 2011) . Interestingly, the five-feature pharmacophore model derived with the modified crystal structure of DNMT1 (Fig. 7a) is consistent with the pharmacophore hypothesis previously reported with the homology model of DNMT1, although the ranking of the features and nearby amino acids are slightly different. Most of the inhibitors matched several pharmacophore features considering a distance tolerance of 2 \u00c5. Representative examples are shown in Fig. 7b -e. All nucleoside analogues except zebularine matched with all five pharmacophore features (Fig. 7b and c) . Zebularine matches four features but it does not satisfy the hydrogen bonding donor feature interacting with Glu1266 because zebularine does not have the amino group on the base ring. However, the donor feature (D) can match the N3 protonated form of zebularine.",

In addition, in an separate virtual screening, a structural analogue of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) (Fig. 5a ) was identified as a potent inhibitor of the methyltransferase activities on flaviviral methyltransferases (Milani et al., 2009) .

For this assay, full-length human DNMT1 was expressed by baculovirus infection of Sf9 insect cells for 48 hrs. DNMT1 in this system (FastBac-HT system, Invitrogen) is hexahistidine-tagged and purified on nickel NTA resin as we have described previously (Yokochi and Robertson, 2002) and dialyzed to remove imidazole. DNMT1 was used with the colorimetric 96-well plate-based DNA methyltransferase activity kit from Epigentek (an ELISA-like assay using anti-5-methylcytosine antibody to detect methylation). After a 1 hr incubation of DNMT1 with substrate plus or minus inhibitor, samples were read in a plate reader at 450 nm to determine activity. Fig. 8a illustrates the dose-response plot over a range of DNMT1 concentrations for this assay. This figure (Figs. 8b-d) also shows inhibition plots for selected inhibitors that were used as positive controls; namely, SAH, the natural product EGCG, and the L-tryptophan derivative RG108. SAH and EGCG showed IC 50 values of 8.6 M and 0.7 M, respectively. Under these assay conditions, RG108 showed only 11% inhibition at 100 M. Fig. 9a shows the inhibition plot for ATA, revealing an IC 50 = 0.68 M against DNMT1. Of note, the enzymatic inhibitory activity of ATA against DNMT1 was greater than the activity of SAH and RG108 and it was comparable with the activity of EGCG under the current assay conditions. We also measured the Dnmt3a inhibition by ATA that showed an IC 50 = 1.4 M (Fig. 9b) indicating that ATA is somewhat selective toward DNMT1 (~2-fold).",

            "text": "In order to explore the binding mode of ATA with DNMT1 at the molecular level we conducted molecular modeling of ATA. Docking of ATA with the crystal structure of DNTM1 modified into an active conformation suggested two binding poses. The first docking pose of ATA is shown in Fig. 6d as a deprotonated form (expected in aqueous solution). According to this binding model, ATA forms a strong hydrogen bond network with the same amino acid residues that interact with the nucleoside inhibitors. The hydroxybenzoic acid moieties of ATA form hydrogen bonds with Glu1266, Arg1310, Arg1312, Ser1230, Gly1231, and Lys1535. The other carboxylate group makes interactions with Asn1578. The structurally related 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid (NSC14778) showed weak inhibitory activity against DNMT1 in a biochemical assay (Kuck et al., 2010b) . Although the binding pose of NSC14778 partially overlaps ATA showing same interactions with Ser1230, Gly1231, and Lys1535, NSC14778 does not make key interactions with Glu1266 and Arg1312 (not shown). A similar binding model of NSC14778 was also determined in our previous study using the homology model (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011b) . The second pose of ATA was consistent with the recently reported binding mode in the catalytic site of homology model (Yoo and Medina-Franco, 2011c) . Of note, ATA shows a good docking score comparable to those of nucleoside inhibitors (Table 1) .",

In contrast, NSC14778 satisfies only one, the negative feature (N). Therefore, this model suggests that introduction of a substituent that could match the donor or acceptor feature associated with the interaction of glutamate or arginine residues would enhance the affinity of the analogue NSC14778. The binding position of NSC97317 matches with three pharmacophoric features i.e., negative charge (N), hydrogen bond acceptor (A), and aromatic ring (R). These findings are further supported the experimental observation and analysis of docking energy.",

Computational approaches are increasingly being used to identify promising compounds as potential therapeutic agents or as research tools to study epigenetic mechanisms involving DNMTs. Also, computational methods are employed to better understand the mechanism of established inhibitors of DNA methylation. Herein, we describe molecular modeling studies with a recently published crystallographic structure of human DNMT1 that contains unmethylated DNA and the enzyme in an 'inactive' conformation. The conformation of the crystallographic structure was modeled in an active state using molecular dynamics. Experimentally known DNMT1 inhibitors were docked in parallel into the modified crystal structure with Glide HTVS, SP, and XP. The binding modes were characterized by common interactions with amino acid residues that participate in the proposed mechanism of DNA C5-methylation and other key amino acid residues including Ser1230, Gly1231, Glu1266, Arg1310, Arg1312, and Lys1535. The docking scores were also able to distinguish active inhibitors from known inactive and previously used decoy compounds. Indeed, most of the established inhibitors of DNMT1 had high ranking scores. Based on the docking results, a structure-based pharmacohpore model was developed that was characterized by five features, including a negative charge, an aromatic ring, a hydrogen bond acceptor and two donor sites. The pharmacophore model represents the key protein-ligand interactions of the DNMT1 inhibitors obtained in docking. Results of the docking and pharmacophore modeling had a good agreement with the insights of the modeling studies published previously using a homology model of the catalytic domain of DNMT1. As part of an ongoing interest of identifying novel inhibitors, we experimentally tested aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) in an enzymatic inhibition assay. Preliminary docking studies of ATA with DNMT1 had strongly suggested that this structural analogue of 5,5-methylenedisalicylic acid would show enzymatic inhibitory activity. Indeed, ATA showed an IC 50 = 0.68 M against human DNMT1. We also measured the Dnmt3a inhibition by ATA, which showed an IC 50 = 1.4 M, indicating that ATA is somewhat selective toward DNMT1 (~2-fold).",
