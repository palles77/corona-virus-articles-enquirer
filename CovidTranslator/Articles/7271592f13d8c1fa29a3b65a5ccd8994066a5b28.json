We would like to define RNA editing in a broad sense as any process that results in the production of an RNA molecule which differs in nucleotide sequence in coding regions from the DNA template, provided that the difference is not the result of the removal of introns by a classic splicing mechanism.",

            "text": "The maxicircle DNA molecules encode an incomplete set of standard mitochondrial genes (Simpson, 1987) . The sequence of 21 kb of the 30 kb maxicircle molecule of L. tarentolae is known, as is the sequence of almost the entire 22 kb maxicircle molecule of T. brucei and approximately 6 kb of the 32 kb maxicircle of Crithidia fasciculata. The identified genes of L. tarentolae encode the two small mitochondrial rRNAs and components of the respiratory chain, including cytochrome b (CYb), cytochrome oxidase subunits I, II, and Ill (COI, COII, and COIII), and NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1, 4, and 5 (NDl, ND4, and ND5) ( Figure 1 ). In addition, there are also four unidentified open reading frames (MURF = maxicircle unidentified reading frame, Simpson et al., 1987) , one of which (MURF3) has sequence homology with ORF392 from Marchantia polymorpha chloroplast DNA (Ohyama et al., 1986) . In comparison, the mitochondrial genomes of mammals and yeast both encode two mitochondrial rRNAs, the structural genes for COI, COII, COIII, and CYb, and at least two subunits of ATP synthetase (6 and 8). Genes for seven subunits of NADH dehydrogenase (ND) are in addition present in the human mitochondrial genome, whereas genes for a small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit protein (Var-1) and a third subunit of ATP synthetase (9) are present in the yeast mitochondrial genome. A large portion of the maxicircle (13 kb in L. tarentolae and 7 kb in T. brucei) is apparently noncoding, and consists of tandem repeats of varying complexities . Since this region varies in size and sequence between species, it has been termed the variable or divergent region; a lack of open reading frames, rapid changes in sequence between species, and a low abundance of steady-state transcripts (de Vries et al., 1988; Tarassoff et al., 1987) make it difficult to assign a genetic function to this portion of the maxicircle.",

Comparison of Mitochondrial Genomes of Three Kinetoplastid Species A comparison of the informational maxicircle DNA sequences from L. tarentolae and T brucei and a partial sequence from C. fasciculata revealed that the T. brucei maxicircle lacks sequences homologous to the COIII, MURF3, and ORF12 (=MURF4) genes (Figures 1 and 2 ). In place of these genes, shorter GC-rich sequences are substituted ( Figure  3 ). All other maxicircle genes in T. brucei and L. tarentolae are present at equivalent relative locations and with identical polarities. The C. fasciculata sequence clearly belongs to the L. tarentolae class, in that homologous genes for MURFB and COIII are found immediately upstream of the CYb gene. The other significant observation was that the internal frameshifts present in the COII and MURFB genes are conserved in the homologous C. fasciculata (Benne et al., 1986; van der Spek et al., 1988) and T. brucei (Payne et al., 1985) gene sequences and therefore are not likely to be due to DNA sequencing errors.",

It was found that there were four extra uridine nucleotides at this position in the mRNA sequence (Benne et al., 1986 ) which eliminated the -1 frameshift encoded by the gene. Hybridization studies indicated that a DNA template encoding the modified sequence was not present in the mitochondrial or nuclear genomes of these organisms (Benne et al., 1986) . Soon thereafter, additional examples of RNA editing were reported, including 34 added U's in the 5' end of the CYb mRNA of T. brucei , 39 added U's in the CYb mRNAs of L. tarentolae and C. fasciculata (Feagin et al., 1988a) , and multiple added U's in mRNAs for three other maxicircle genes of all three species Shaw et al., 1988; van der Spek et al., 1988) . The deletion of genome-encoded U's was also found to occur in several mRNAs (Shaw et al., 1988) . The importance of comparative studies was underscored by the observation that the new methionine initiation codons and the N-terminal amino acid sequences created by this process were almost completely conserved in the three species, which are thought to have been separated by at least 100 million years (Lake et al., 1988) .",

Type II cryptogenes (e.g., CYb in all three species) yield transcripts that are edited at the 5'ends within protein-coding regions ( Figure  4 -3). Some genes have both Type I and Type II cryptogene properties, as, for example, the C. fasciculata and L. tarentolae MURFB genes ( Figure 4 -5). Finally, Type III cryptogenes (e.g., T. brucei COIII) yield transcripts that are extensively edited (pan-edited) over their entire length to generate RNA nucleotide sequences that encode completely new proteins (Figure 4 -7). The use of this terminology is not meant to imply that these divisions represent three distinct types of editing. In fact, as new examples of RNA editing are described, we may find a continuum of cryptogene types. All edited and pre-edited regions described to date are presented in Figure 4 and the equivalent maxicircle genomic locations are shown in Figure 1 . CYb, MURF2, COIII, and COII transcripts are edited in all three kinetoplastid species, and MURF3 transcripts are edited in two species. It should be noted that the T. brucei MURFB and MURF4 genes appear on the basis of preliminary RNA sequences (Feagin et al., 1988a; Feagin and Stuart, personal communication) to represent Type III pan-edited cryptogenes also. At the present time, pan-edited cryptogenes have not been identified in the L. tarentolae or C. fasciculata maxicircles. There are, however, several intergenic regions in the maxicircle DNAs of all three species (shaded regions in Figure 3 and Figure 1 ) which produce G-rich transcripts of heterogeneous size . Although these regions do not exhibit sequence similarity ( Figure  2 ) there is nevertheless a conservation of the relative location of regions of G versus C strand bias ( Figure 3 ). We speculate that these sequences may represent cryptogenes that could give rise to pan-edited transcripts. The low abundance transcripts of the (AT-rich) divergent region, which are heterogeneous in size (Tarassoff et al., 1987; de Vries et al., 1988) represent additional candidates for pan-editing events. The 9s and 12s rRNAs have not been examined for edited regions, except for the 5' ends, which were found to be unedited by primer extension sequencing Shonekan and Simpson, unpublished data) .",

The sequences at the unedited/ edited junctions in these molecules are complex and can cover up to six editing sites (see boxed regions in Figure  6 ). Moreover, the sequences at the junctions often differ from the sequences found in the DNA or the fully edited RNA at these positions. In several cases the number of U's at an editing site differs from that found in the mature transcript, and in one case, two U's are added at a site that is not edited in the mature RNA.

Editing of Type I COII and MURFB transcripts allows translational readthrough of genomically encoded frameshifts. In several species, the Type II cryptogenes, CYb, MURFP, and COIII, lack ATG codons for the initiation of translation. RNA editing events in the 5' ends of these transcripts create in-frame AUG codons and thereby provide a translational control mechanism for the production of mitochondrial proteins. However, noncanonical initiation codons may also be used to translate some maxicircle mRNAs, since transcripts of several genes lack AUG initiation codons. In some cases, the 5' ends of transcripts are edited but an in-frame AUG is not generated (e.g., L. tarentolae and C. fasciculata MURF3), while in other cases, transcripts that do not contain AUG initiation codons are not edited at all (L. tarentolae MURM and MURFl, C. fasciculata NDl, and T. brucei ND1 and MURFl) (Shaw et al., 1988; van der Spek et al., 1988; Feagin and Stuart, personal communication) . Two additional functions of RNA editing are the creation of new N-terminal amino acids in Type II editing which may be important for structure and/or function of the proteins, and, of course, the creation of an entire protein coding sequence in Type III editing. The known editing events generate codons for all of the amino acids but lysine, with certain hydrophobic amino acids represented more frequently: phenylalanine, leucine, cysteine, and valine. As would be expected, U-rich codons are preferentially used. Finally, the production of translatable MURFB mRNA in C. fasciculata may be negatively controlled since an in-frame ATG encoded by the MURF3 cryptogene is moved out of frame by U addition in the 5' region of the transcript (van der Spek et al., 1988) .",

In fact, mitochondrial protein synthesis itself has never been rigorously demonstrated in any kinetoplastid (Benne et al., 1983; Spithill et al., 1981) . Although it is clear that the 9s and 12s rRNAs represent highly diverged homologs of standard rRNAs (Eperon et al., 1983; de la Cruz et al., 1985a; de la Cruz et al., 1985b; Sloof et al., 1985) , no mitochondrial ribosomal particle containing these RNAs has ever been isolated. Evidence for the existence of mitochondrial protein synthesis mainly involves the observed transcription of maxicircle DNA, the precise editing of some transcripts to yield translatable mRNAs, and the presence of a set of mitochondrial tRNAs.

Editing of the MURF2 and COIII transcripts, however, occurs during both lifecycle stages.

            "text": "Evidence for the Absence of Edited DNA or RNA Templates The most startling aspect of the phenomenon of kinetoplastid RNA editing is the apparent absence of a conventional DNA or RNA template encoding the fully edited region. The evidence is mainly derived from hybridization studies using oligonucleotide probes complementary to either the edited or the unedited sequence for each cryptogene. These experiments did not detect edited templates in the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes of these cells. Moreover, edited templates could not be detected by several alternative methods, including direct sequencing of uncloned maxicircle DNA (Shaw et al., 1988) and PCR amplification of total kDNA using primers flanking the edited regions (Sturm, Shonekan, and Simpson, unpublished data). It has been suggested that edited RNAs might selfreplicate (Maizels and Weiner, 1988 ). If it can be shown by kinetic experiments that the partially edited molecules represent true editing intermediates, then the existence of a continuum of such molecules is strong theoretical evidence against an RNA template hypothesis since separate templates would be required for each type of intermediate. However, the partially edited molecules could also possibly represent bizzare recombinants between edited and nonedited RNA and not necessarily editing intermediates. The fully edited antisense RNAs predicted by the Weiner model have not been detected by Northern hybridization using sense edited oligonucleotide probes (Feagin et al., 1988a) or by PCR experiments designed to amplify antisense edited RNAs (Sturm, Shonekan, Balakara, and Simpson, unpublished data). However, PCR amplification studies have provided preliminary evidence for the presence of antisense unedited RNA for the L. tarentolae MURF2 gene (Sturm and Simpson, unpublished data), the origin and significance of which is not understood.",

As discussed above, there is no evidence for this type of maxicircle heterogeneity or for the presence of single copies of edited genes in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA. -A variant of the pseudogene hypothesis states that there are small edited RNAs which are transcribed from small edited DNA sequences scattered throughout the genome (mitochondrial or nuclear) which could give rise to mature edited RNA molecules by a process of franssplicing, such as that which occurs for the cytosolic mRNA population in these cells. This model has been tested with negative results (Shaw et al., 1988) by hybridization of Northern blots containing total mitochondrial RNA with labeled antisense edited oligomers. In addition, the presence of small edited sequences of 20 bp or greater in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA would have been detected by oligonucleotide probes used in the DNA hybridization experiments described above.",

This hypothesis, however, is difficult to test experimentally. -Some investigators have suggested that cryptic signals sequence might become exposed in incompletely edited molecules and that these molecules could then proceed to become fully and precisely edited species (Stuart, 1989) .

As stated previously, there is no evidence for the presence of edited antisense RNA in the mitochondrial compartment.

The evidence for posttranscriptional editing includes the fact that poly(A) tails contain U's which most likely are inserted by the same mechanism that adds U's to coding regions, and polyadenylation is known to be a posttranscriptional enzymatic process (Humphrey et al , 1987; Conway and Wickens, 1987; Zarkower and Wickens, 1987) . The fact that completely unedited and partially edited RNAs exist and that the ratio of edited/unedited RNAs varies from gene to gene also suggests a posttranscriptional process. The evidence for the involvement of a multienzyme complex in editing includes the apparent 3' to 5' polarity, which suggests the progressive movement of a complex along the primary transcript, and the fact that the junction regions of some partially edited molecules extend over several editing sites, which suggests that the complex is quite large. The existence of edited RNAs truncated at editing sites and the presence of excess U's in junction regions of partially edited RNAs even at sites not edited in the mature RNA suggest the involvement of a riboendonuclease that lacks specificity and a terminal transferase U-addition enzyme that adds multiple U's to the released termini. The polarity of editing also suggests that editing does not occur on the ribosome, as the ribosome must bind to the initiation codon which is created by editing at the termination of the process. The following hypothetical scenario is suggested by these facts: A specific riboendonuclease recognizes some aspect of the edited region and produces multiple random cleavages within a pre-edited sequence covering up to six editing sites (and in the poly(A) tail), a uridylyl transferase then adds multiple U's to the termini of the cleaved fragments, an exonuclease trims the excess U's to exactly the required number (or deletes encoded U's), and an RNA ligase rejoins the modified regions.",

These activities comigrate with the kinetoplast-mitochondrion fraction in isopycnic Renografin (Braly et al., 1974) and Percoll density gradients, and can be released by Triton lysis of the organelle (Bakalara et al., unpublished data) . The TUTase activity adds several U's to the 3'OH of both endogeneous mitochondrial RNAs in intact mitochondria and exogeneous RNA molecules in Triton lysates of mitochondria (Bakalara et al., unpublished data) . Although this activity could not directly produce the subclass of truncated 5'poly(U)partially edited molecules (Figures 6-1 and 6 -2) it is possible that the 5' poly(U) tails on these cDNAs are artifacts of cloning and are not true intermediates since they were not observed on truncated MURF3 cDNAs (van der Spek et al., 1988) .

Although there is evidence that most kinetoplastid mitochondrial tRNAs are transcribed from nuclear genes (Suyama, Campbell, Simpson, and Simpson, unpublished data) , the possibility remains that a small subset of tRNAs is produced by extensive editing of mitochondrial transcripts.

The mechanism in this case appears to involve a slippage or stuttering of the RNA polymerase at an encoded T residue. A similar cotranscriptional RNA modification phenomenon appears to be occurring in negative strand RNA viruses, both in the synthesis of 3'poly(A) tails by transcriptional stuttering on a terminal homopolymer stretch of U residues, and within coding regions The latter was first described in the paramyxovirus, SV5, in which the presence of two nontemplated G residues in a subpopulation of mRNAs for the P. gene overcomes a frameshift and joins two open reading frames to produce the P protein (Thomas et al., 1988) . The mRNAs lacking these extra G residues code for the V protein which is amino coterminal with the P protein. Since the nonencoded G's are added after four encoded G's, a stuttering mechanism is also thought to be responsible for this phenomenon. However, out of 22 cDNAs, 10 were found to be modified by the addition of 2 G residues at the same location and the remainder were not modified, which suggests that the mechanism may be precise in this case (Thomas et al., 1988) . A similar phenomenon was described for the case of measles virus, and it was suggested that similar events might occur in other paramyxoviruses . The main difference in the measles virus situation is that the G addition is imprecise with respect to the number of G's added .",

The paramyxoviral type of RNA editing also involves a modification of the primary sequence of coding regions of mRNA molecules, but clearly involves a different mechanism and has a different evolutionary origin, as does the coronaviral type of RNA editing. Assuming tentatively that the RNA editing phenomena in kinetoplastids and Physarum are mechanistically similar and are derived from a common ancestor of these primitive lower eukaryotes, this argues for an ancient origin of this process and therefore a possibly wider distribution in present day organisms. In general, RNA editing has a clear selective advantage in evolution in addition to a possible role in regulation of translation, in that genetic information can be maintained at the RNA level in the face of sequence drift and even sequence compression at the genomic level. The presence of abundant noncoding DNA sequences and pseudogenes is a hallmark of the genomic organization of higher eukaryotic cells, and the existence of a process such as the kinetoplastid type of RNA editing might make it worthwhile to reevaluate the significance of some of these sequences.",

The results indicated that COIII genes cannot be detected in the mitochondrial genomes of two Herpetomonas species. This led to the tentative conclusion that pan-edited cryptogenes may also be present in Herpetomonas. This conclusion is consistent with previous suggestions that Herpetomonas is an evolutionary precursor of Trypanosoma, since Herpetomonas sp. are one of the two monogenetic kinetoplastids that undergo morphogenetic changes resembling those occurring in the digenetic Trypanosoma (Hoare, 1972) .",

There appear to be different mechanisms for RNA editing in different systems. The kinetoplastid and perhaps the Physarum type of editing involves the precise addition and deletion of nucleotides within coding regions of mRNA molecules and differs from the paramyxoviral type of editing, which involves a cotranscriptional stuttering of the RNA polymerase on homopolymer stretches. Both types differ from the mammalian apolipoprotein B type of editing which is thought to involve a chemical nucleotide modification. Since the kinetoplastid type of editing is probably of ancient origin, RNA editing activities are likely to be found in other organisms also. The major puzzle that the discovery of this phenomenon in the kinetoplastids has presented is the mechanistic nature of the information for the precise modifications of coding sequences of mRNAs in the apparent absence of templates encoding this information. The question of what encodes the specificity of edited RNA has direct relevance to the basic tenets of the central dogma of information transfer in molecular genetics, and it is likely that the solution to this problem may prove to be of general biological significance.",
