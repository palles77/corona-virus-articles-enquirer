In the method proposed 40 here, the frame of reference for the quasispecies \"cloud\" is reduced to the level of K-length 41 motifs. In order to estimate the connectedness of these K-mers across the input assemblies, a 42 distance matrix between all of the unique K-mers observed across the designated virus genome 43 assemblies is established using hamming distance. Hierarchical clustering is then performed on 44 the resulting distance matrix using an average linkage function, corresponding to the ultrametric 45 assumption used in Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) 46 phylogenies, and flat clusters are extracted using a hyperparameter for the distance cutoff of 47 cluster membership. The constituents of these clusters are then aligned and their positional 48 variants represented using the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) 49 nucleic acid notation with degenerate base symbols. These degenerate motifs are mapped back to 50 their respective assemblies. This approach facilitates interpretation of model features in a 51 functional profiling and hypothesis generating context. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this 52 new feature extraction technique, genotype-to-phenotype linear models were trained on various 53 RNA virus groups.

The motif 121 also appears across both Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus group species that infect 122 humans. Interestingly its pattern of appearance in those groups varies in a way not predicated on 123 this taxonomic organization. In the Alphacoronavirus examples that it appears in, namely 229E 124 and NL63, this motif is located in the same reading frame within the spike S2 glycoprotein 125 protein and encodes a conserved QDVVNQ amino acid sequence. However, when it appears in 126 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), it remains in the same reading frame, coding for a 127 YNVVNK amino acid sequence, but instead occurs in the polyprotein in the N-terminus of non-128 structural protein (NSP) 15.

The identity of the motif, 258 AATGTRACAGTAACACA, and its translated product, NVTVTH, again demonstrate a 259 preference for rare human codons -in this case, valine.

While in the 264 avian examples of segment 4, those codons are switched to GTG, which are the most common 265 Valine codons with a 46% relative frequency in mallards. A motif for the avian version of this 266 was developed using a multiple sequence alignment of the non-human and non-swine isolates of 267 the H1 subtype assemblies in the training set. This motif was established as 268 AAYGTRACYGTGACYCA and mapped back to the training set sequences. When mapped, this 269 new motif was resolved to 480 avian isolates, 33 swine isolates, and nothing else. Unfortunately, 270 unlike the above-mentioned Influenza A motif, the constituent K-mers for this motif were below 271 the quantile cutoff for clustering, and thus, were unable to become a directly observed feature of 272 the model. The use of rare codons, and their tendency to cluster, has been observed across both 273 eukaryotes and prokaryotes 20 .
