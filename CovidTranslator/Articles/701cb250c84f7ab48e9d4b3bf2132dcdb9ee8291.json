Here, we explored the interaction between IBV and the host innate immune system. Severe histopathological lesions were observed in the tracheal mucosa at 3-5 days post inoculation (dpi) and in the kidney at 8 dpi, with heavy viral loads at 1-11 and 1-28 dpi, respectively. The expression of mRNAs encoding Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and TLR7 were upregulated at 3-8 dpi, and that of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon (IFN) \u03b2 (TRIF) was upregulated at 21 dpi in the trachea and kidney. Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) was upregulated in the trachea during early infection. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 3 and TRAF6 were upregulated expression in both tissues. Moreover, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), stimulator of IFN genes (STING), and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), as well as TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK) \u0511, IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7, nuclear factor of kappaB (NF-\u03baB), IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, various interleukins(ILs), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (MIP-1\u03b2) were significantly upregulated in the trachea and downregulated in the kidney. These results suggested that the TLR and MDA5 signaling pathways and innate immune cytokine were induced after IBV infection. Additionally, consistent responses to IBV infection were observed during early infection, with differential and complicated responses in the kidney.",

Direct losses result from mortality, secondary bacterial infections, decreased weight gain, poor produc-tion and egg quality, and false layers, whereas indirect losses arise from increasing costs and challenges in IBV prevention (Awad et al., 2014) . There are multiple known strains of IBV, and increasing numbers of variants have emerged continuous recombination, resulting in more diversified and complicated genotypes and serotypes Mo et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015) . With poor vaccine crossprotection between different serotypes, such diversity makes it difficult to prevent and control IBV infection using vaccines. Moreover, IBV is also similar to human coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus .",

            "text": "The innate immune response is the first line of host defense against exogenous pathogens and consists of a network of mechanisms, molecules, and cells, particularly pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which function to identify various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-Ilike receptors (RLRs) are two primary and important PRRs involved in recognition of viral components. Endosomal TLR3 and TLR7 recognize viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), respectively (Mogensen, 2009) . Upon binding to their respective ligands, TLR3 recruits the adaptor TIR domaincontaining adaptor inducing interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 (TRIF), and TLR7 recruits Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88). TRIF associates with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 3 and TRAF6, whereas MyD88 only interacts with TRAF6. In the downstream response, TRAF6 phosphorylates the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7 directly or activates the transforming growth factor \u03b2-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex to bind to the inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK) complex, composed of IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, and IKK\u03b3, and leads to activation of nuclear factor of kappaB (NF-\u03baB). Active NF-\u03baB translocates into the nucleus from the cytoplasm and induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b2, and regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES). On the other hand, TRAF3 recruits the IKKrelated kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKK\u0511, resulting in phosphorylation of IRF7. The phosphorylated IRF7 translocates into the nucleus and then activates the promoters of type I IFNs and IFN-inducible gene expression (Takeuchi and Akira, 2009; Kawasaki and Kawai, 2014) . Notably, some downstream signaling molecules are intersectional with other TLRs and RLRs.",

The activated RLRs interact with the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), thereby directly binding to TRAF3 or TRAF6 and TRAF2. The recruitment of TRAF6 and TRAF3, which is responsible for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity for the assembly of the IKK\u0511 and TBK1 complex, leads to the activation of NF-\u03baB and IRF7, promotes the production of IL-8 and IL-12, and enhances the induction of type I IFN (Nakhaei et al., 2009) . The RIG-I gene has not been identified in chickens, and the MDA5 signaling pathway has been shown to mediate type I IFN induction, with laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) function as a positive regulator (Zou et al., 2009; Liniger et al., 2011) . The novel stimulator of IFN genes (STING) protein has been found in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membrane in DF-1 cells and has been shown to activate both IRF7 and NF-\u03baB transcription pathways to induce IFN-\u03b2 through interactions with MDA5 and MAVS (Cheng et al., 2015) .",

RIG-I is upregulated during MHV infection, and viral recognition by RIG-I and MDA5 is the driving force for the activation of IRF3 and the ensuing induction of IFN-\u03b2 (Li et al., 2010) . Several coronaviruses, including IBV, have evolved evasive strategies to avoid immunological defense mechanisms from the host by utilizing innate immune signaling molecules (Zhong et al., 2012; Kint et al., 2015) . SARS-CoV can negatively regulate the assembly of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKK\u03b5 complexes required for activation of IRF3 to disrupt antiviral defenses .",

The results showed that in the early phase of infection, both TLR3 and TLR7 transcripts were significantly upregulated in the trachea at 3-8 dpi, but were only upregulated at 5 or 3 dpi in the kidney, respectively. Additionally, MyD88 was significantly upregulated at 1-3 dpi in the trachea. Concurrently, MDA5, LGP2, and STING transcripts were upregulated in the trachea at 1-28 dpi. Since the IBV load was rapidly increased in the trachea during this period, with limited expression in the kidney, the invasion and replication of IBV may result in the generation of massive viral RNA, including ssRNA, dsRNA, and other RNA intermediates, which are recognized by TLR3, TLR7, and MDA5 and lead to activation of various signaling pathways, as previously reported (Kint et al., 2015) .",

Notably, TLR7 and TRIF were significantly upregulated at 21 dpi in both tissues; MAVS was upregulated at 21 dpi; and MDA5, LGP2, and STING were upregulated at 14-28 dpi. Thus, these data provided the first evidence showing that the TLR and MDA5 signaling pathways were in- volved in the late stage of IBV infection, despite the observation that the viral load was low during this period. Nevertheless, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of type I IFN were upregulated and increased dur-ing the same time period; MDA5 is an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) that can be induced by type I IFN . Therefore, this mechanism may be involved in the observed changes in gene expression, and further studies are required to elucidate the specific details of such mechanisms. We found that the downstream genes TRAF6 and TRAF3 were significantly upregulated in both tissues throughout the experiment. This observation could be explained by the fact that these two molecules are common kinases involved in multiple signal pathways (Takeuchi and Akira, 2009 ). Alternatively, TRAF6 and TRAF3 complexes are inactivated by pathogenic microbes to limit or terminate pro-inflammatory and type I IFN and evade host innate immunity (Shi et al., 2014; Panda et al., 2015) . In contrast, the mRNA levels of MAVS, TBK1, IKK\u0511, IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, IRF7, and NF-\u03baB p65 exhibited more tight regulation in the infected trachea because upregulation of nuclear transcription factors depends on upstream molecules, whereas most genes were significantly downregulated in the kidney. Thus, the different responses and levels of activation of the TLR and MDA5 signal pathways after IBV infection may be related to the threshold of viral loads in the two tissues.",

We observed consistent changes in TLR and MDA5 signaling pathway molecules and these cytokines. Additionally, the mRNA levels of type I IFN, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines were dramatically elevated during IBV infection in the trachea, similar to the results of previous studies (Jang et al., 2013; Dar et al., 2014; Okino et al., 2014; Kameka et al., 2014) . However, fur-ther studies are needed to confirm and explain the significant downregulation of these targets, except for IL-1\u03b2, , in the kidney. Unexpectedly, we found simultaneous peaks in the expression of all cytokines, the viral load, and the presence of histopathological lesions at 5 dpi in the trachea, suggesting that the antiviral effects of innate immune cytokines may be critical during the early stages of infection. Furthermore, the upregulation of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-12, and IL-8 also peaked at 21 dpi, despite the clearance of IBV from the trachea at that time point. These results indicated that innate immune cytokines were still under tight regulation during the late stages of IBV infection.",

During the early stages of infection, these cytokines and chemokines were associated with the infiltration of lymphocytes and heterophils in the tracheal tissues. At 8 dpi, increases in IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and MIP-1\u03b2 proteins were delayed with respect to the peaks in mRNA expression and viral replication in the trachea; the most severe damage occurred in the tracheal tissue at this time point, and slight signs of recovery were observed. This observation may be explained by the common induction of cytokines in the former group by the RLR signaling pathway, which primarily contributes to IFN-\u03b2 induction (Kint et al., 2015) . The cytokines in the latter group were only induced by the TLR signaling pathway, indicating that IBV infection may regulate the host inflammatory responses. However, the inconsistent expression levels of mRNAs and proteins in the kidney indicated that complicated regulatory mechanisms may exist; although both mRNA and protein were downregulated during the early stages of infection, and protein levels increased at a later stage of infection, when mRNA was downregulated. This may be explained by systemic regulation in the infected chickens.",

However, this response differed among tissues, with a general trend toward upregulation in the trachea and downregulation in the kidney. In addition, we found consistent responses for changes in TLR and MDA5 signaling pathway molecules, innate immune cytokines, and histopathology during the early stages of infection; however, complicated regulatory mechanisms may be present, particularly in the kidney. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the most comprehensive analysis of the interplay between a Gammacoronavirus and the avian TLR and MDA5 signaling pathway response. Since most of these receptors and signal molecules are activated by posttranslational modification, such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation, to recognize virus and transmit signal, more research should be done to evaluate the activity and effect of TLR and MDA5 signaling pathway at the protein level.",
