We compared mortality and morbidity in domestic animals using a mixed effects model controlling for village clustering, herd size, and proxy measures of household wealth. Thirty percent of household heads reported that their animals grazed on dropped fruit and 20% reported that they actively fed bitten fruit to their domestic herds. Household heads allowing their cattle to graze on dropped fruit were more likely to report an illness within their herd (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.17, 95% CI 1.02-1.31). Household heads directly feeding goats bitten fruit were more likely to report illness (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16-1.57) and deaths (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.64, 95% CI 1.13-2.4). Reporting of illnesses and deaths among goats rose as the frequency of feeding bitten fruit increased. One possible explanation for this finding is the transmission of bat pathogens to domestic animals via bitten fruit consumption.",

The consumption of bat-bitten, saliva-laden fruits by domestic animals is a proposed mechanism that may lead to pathogen spillover to livestock, and has been suggested with Nipah virus in Malaysia and Hendra virus in Australia (Marsh and Wang 2012; Field et al. 2001; Mahalingam et al. 2012; Paterson et al. 2011) .

In Bangladesh, there are three species of frugivorous bats that are particularly abundant and known to roost and forage near human settlements: Pteropus giganteus, Cynopterus sphinx, and Rousettus leschenaulti (Khan 2001) . Pteropus giganteus, the Indian flying fox, is the natural reservoir for Nipah virus in South Asia, causing human cases annually in Bangladesh (Chakraborty et al. 2015) . In addition, Pteropus bats in Bangladesh have been associated with more than 55 other recently identified viruses, some of which may have the potential to cause disease in other animal or human hosts (Anthony et al. 2013; Epstein et al. 2008; Yadav et al. 2012; Epstein et al. 2010) . Antibodies against an Ebola-like virus have been detected in Rousettus leschenaulti, though the virus remains undetected (Olival et al. 2013 ). All local bat species have been observed feeding on fruits also consumed by people (Sudhakaran and Doss 2012) .",

Household heads were asked to report the number of each type of animal they owned (cattle, buffalo, goats, sheep, pigs, and horses), the presence of sick animals in the year preceding the survey, and the number of each type of animal dying from an illness over a two-month period preceding the survey. The survey did not collect the number of animals that had fallen ill, but reported the presence of ill animals for each species with a binary response. The definition of illness was subjective to the household head, although interviewers provided examples that included fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, and foaming at the mouth. To characterize feeding behaviors, household heads were asked if dropped fruits were grazed by domestic animals, if animal owners directly fed ''bat or bird bitten fruit'' to their domestic animals, and, if so, how frequently. The inclusion of both birds and bats into a single category was necessary as it was very difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate between fruit partially eaten by the two groups.",

We framed a causal diagram to identify associations between variables of interest and to identify confounders (Greenland et al. 1999) . We performed separate modeling for each domestic animal type. For each animal type, we examined two separate outcomes, specified as the dependent variable: the reported presence of illness and the reported presence of deaths. We identified two possible feeding behaviors, herd size for the specific animal in question, and two proxies of household per capita wealth as independent variables. The two feeding behaviors identified in our dataset were household heads allowing grazing of dropped fruit and household heads directly feeding domestic animals bitten fruit. As proxies for household wealth (Kumar 1989) , we used two non-colinear measures of household per capita wealth: the total number of trees per number of people living in the compound and the total number of domestic animals per number of people living in the compound. We first completed an analysis consisting of the outcome variable (presence of death or illness) and one of the two feeding behaviors adjusting only for village-level clustering as a random effect. We then added in the other independent variables as main effects to create a fully adjusted model. For each animal type we had four separate models for all possible combinations of outcome and feeding behavior. Initial models also accounted for location of villages inside or outside of the Nipah Belt area, but this did not affect the results. Given that this study was not meant to be specific to Nipah virus, this was excluded from the final model.",

In our study, directly feeding bitten fruit was associated with mortality and morbidity in goats and allowing grazing on dropped fruit was associated with morbidity in cattle. Household heads actively feeding their goats bat-and bird-bitten fruit were more likely to report both deaths and illnesses among their goats. The relationship between morbidity and mortality and the consumption of bitten fruit was dose-dependent for goats: the more frequent the feeding of bitten fruit, the more likely household heads reported illnesses and deaths. One explanation for our findings that has implications for public health is the transmission of zoonotic pathogens to domestic animals via the consumption of bat-bitten, saliva-laden fruit. Animals are directly fed bitten fruit and also may come in contact with bitten fruit while grazing on dropped fruit. While our study did not allow us to clearly differentiate between bird-and bat-eaten fruit, there is much evidence to suggest that bats pose the larger threat (Luis et al. 2013) . Given the inclusion of likely innocuous bird-bitten fruit, we may be under-representing the danger to domestic animals of consuming bat-bitten fruit. Our Figure 3 .

Although no association between bitten fruit consumption and Nipah virus infection in humans has been uncovered (Hegde et al. 2013; Rahman et al. 2012; Hossain et al. 2008) , case reports of human Nipah virus infection in Bangladesh suggest that sick domestic animals may occasionally transmit infections to humans, with human cases occurring in individuals contacting sick cattle, pigs, and goats (Hsu et al. 2004; Luby et al. 2009; ICDDRB 2003) . Outside of Bangladesh, the movement of pathogens from bats to human populations via domestic animals consuming contaminated bitten fruit has been proposed in human cases of Hendra and Nipah viruses. In the Australian emergence of Hendra virus, horses potentially became infected with Hendra virus after consuming spats dropped by Pteropus bat species (flying foxes) and then may have infected their human caretakers (Mahalingam et al. 2012 ). The 1998 Malaysian Nipah virus outbreak, which affected 265 people and led to 105 deaths (Looi and Chua 2007) , coincided with a large scale pattern of agricultural intensification, with mango and pig production increasing throughout the Malay peninsula (Pulliam et al. 2012) . Pigs raised in fruit orchards had easy access to dropped fruit and masticated fruit fiber spats from overhanging trees (Parashar et al. 2000) . Humans then contracted the disease from the handling of sick pigs. The virus remains viable in mangos for up to 30 h (Fogarty et al. 2008) , and the fruit likely both attracted fruit bats and provided an effective vehicle for viral transmission to domestic animals.",

Households that rely heavily on dropped fruit as a source of food for animals or feed their animals bitten fruit, for example, may be too impoverished to provide their animals with other sources of food or provide appropriate veterinary care to their animals. Mortality and morbidity therefore could be related to poverty rather than pathogen transmission. While our analysis suggests that proxy measures of household per capita wealth have no bearing on the morbidity and mortality outcomes of herds, we could only use wealth indicators based on the data collected in the survey. Use of two production assets as measures may be insufficient to distinguish gradations of wealth or may inappropriately clump households into a small number of groups (McKenzie 2005) . With access to other indicators in our dataset, we might have been able to detect a difference based on wealth.",

Without diagnoses, we cannot be sure that bat-related pathogens were responsible for the mortality and morbidity reported. Illnesses may be transmitted from other animals, or, even more broadly, stem from the possibility that animals allowed to eat dropped fruit may also be more likely to indiscriminately eat other things that are toxic or injurious. Because we do not have data on the cause of death, we cannot verify that deaths were caused by infection. Deaths could, for example, be caused by injury, trauma, or toxic exposure, and these exposures might be more common in animals that are free range and allowed to graze on dropped fruit as these animals may not be protected in enclosures or well attended. Nor did we have seasonality data linking illness or deaths in herds to specific times of year. This might have allowed us to control for known common seasonal illnesses in domestic animal herds.",

The survey only collected data on domestic animal deaths occurring in the 2 months preceding the interview date. Although interviews occurred throughout the year, making seasonal basis less likely to be an issue, we are likely under-reporting domestic animal deaths. We may, therefore, be underestimating the risk of mortality from eating dropped and bitten fruit. In addition, household heads were not asked to distinguish between fruit with bites and masticated fruit (''spats'') which bats are known to drop as they feed. Nor is it clear from our data how often animals were fed spats, which may be more laden with saliva than a bitten piece of whole fruit and may increase risk of disease transmission.",

Because Bangladeshi villagers generally own goats and cattle, we were able to collect sufficient data on these species, but a larger or species-directed study would be needed to explore similar relationships with other domestic animal species. The stronger statistical results in goats might suggest that the pathogens involved are either more pathogenic in goats or that goats ingest a larger inoculum.",

This could reflect spillover of pathogens into domestic animals. If this is the case, it raises questions regarding future risk to human populations and the costs, both in lost animals and in treatment, to farmers that rely on these animals for income, food, and productivity. Changing behaviors surrounding the active feeding of bitten fruit to domestic animals may provide a path to decrease mortality and morbidity in domestic animals and mitigate zoonotic disease emergence. Some initial possibilities might include cutting away bitten areas on fruit or washing fruit before feeding to domestic animals. Finally, future serologic studies and pathogen discovery studies aimed at sick domestic animals actively being fed bitten fruit and their human owners may provide an efficient approach to identifying spillover events and detecting pathogens that pose the highest risk to humans.",
