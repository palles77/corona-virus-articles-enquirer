Dengue is currently considered an international public health emergency (WHO and TDR, 2009 ) because of its extremely fast diffusion rate. According to a recent estimate, around 390 million people are infected annually with dengue virus worldwide (Bhatt et al., 2013) . Dengue is considered the most important arboviral disease of humans, with estimated over half of the world's population living in areas of contagion risk (Gubler, 2011) . The frequency and magnitude of dengue epidemic have increased dramatically during the past 40 years, during which time both the dengue virus and the mosquito vectors have expanded geographically in most tropical and even some subtropical regions of the world. Modern urbanization in the recent decades, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions, stood out as one of the principal drivers of the epidemic dengue, along with globalization and lack of effective mosquito control (Gubler, 2011) .",

Moreover, in addition to environmental factors, the extensive spread of the disease might be explainable by other factors (Wen et al., 2012; Hsieh et al., 2013) . The importance of human mobility affecting infectious disease spread and emergence is widely recognized (Prothero, 1977; Wilson, 1995; Colizza et al., 2007; Hsieh et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2009) . In particular, the impact of public transportation network on local spread of infectious diseases, especially that of Tuberculosis, has been extensively studied (Tatem et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2013; Horna-Campos et al., 2007; Barrett et al., 2008; Edelson and Phypers, 2011) . Recent studies suggest that the routine movement of individuals could potentially enhance dengue transmission, as it can easily go beyond the dispersal range of mosquito population, resulting in largescale outbreaks (Wen et al., 2012; Benedict et al., 2007; Kan et al., 2008; Adams and Kapan, 2009; Saba et al., 2014a Saba et al., , 2014b .",

In particular, it has been suggested that commuters, if they are infected, can play an important role by enhancing the pace of diffusion (Wen et al., 2012) , and that the \"transport interfaces\" (as such a metro station) can be used to better evaluate environmental exposure in epidemiologic research (Perchoux et al., 2013) . Despite this increasing interest amidst the aforementioned importance of modern urbanization to the spread of dengue, however, there has been no study on the impact of public metro transportation system on local spread of dengue in urban settings, to our best knowledge. It is most likely due to the difficulty in collecting relevant locality, transportation and disease incidence data with sufficient detail and more importantly, in suitably quantifying the combined effect of proximity and passenger flow.",

Moreover, the number of reported dengue cases in Kaohsiung has increased dramatically in the past two years (2014) (2015) . The July 2014 gas explosion in Kaohsiung had surely contributed greatly to the recordingbreaking DENV-1 outbreak in Kaohsiung in 2014 (Wang et al., 2016 (Wang et al., , 2015 . However, there were neither any such catastrophic events nor any unusual climatological event, such as typhoon, that could have led to the even more severe outbreak in Kaohsiung in 2015. Moreover, each of these two massive local outbreaks resulted in more reported cases than the total case number of all previous years in Kaohsiung before 2014.

The RAMPP index reflects the population density, as the location of the stations is planned to provide easy access to as many people locally as possible, and consequently the most crowded stations are often located in highly populated areas. At the same time, however, our index carries additional and more \"dynamic\" information. Aedes mosquitos (Ae. Aegypti and Ae. albopictus) are known to be diurnal feeders (Carrington et al., 2013; Farajollahi et al., 2012) . It is exactly during the daytime that people living in proximity of one or more busy stations can come into contact with a number of individuals (students, workers, etc.), which is potentially even larger than the population itself, thus increasing the infection probability. In other words, the RAMPP index somehow incorporates and extends the information related to the population density, and such consideration is consistent with the fact that the correlation between RAMPP and dengue incidence is greater than the correlation between population density and dengue incidence. By examining the geographic pattern of yearly incidence rate in 2014 (Fig. 2) , it can be observed that all Li's with at least 1000 infections per 100,000 inhabitants are located in the central area in the districts of Yancheng, Sanmin, Xinxing, Lingya, Qianzhen, and Fengshan. The only exceptions are two Li's in Xiaogang district, close to Kaohsiung International Airport, and one Li in Nanzi district. It is interesting to note that most of these Li's are located along the southern branch of the Red Line (from Houyi station to Siaogang station) or the central-western branch of the Orange Line (from Yanchengpu station to Weiwuying station). One can make similar observations regarding the 2015 epidemic (Fig. 2) . Due to the larger amount of cases recorded, the number of Li's with an elevated incidence rate obviously increases in 2015; however, their spatial distribution at district level is almost the same. With respect to 2014, only a couple of Li's with incidence rate N 1500 are registered in both Gushan and Zuoying district.",

The Dunn's tests performed on the RAMPP-based clusters show that, on average, the yearly incidence rate is significantly higher, where the risk associated with the presence of KRT stations is elevated. In fact, despite the number of cases reported during the 2014 outbreak was lower than that in 2015, and considering two different clustering solutions, the statistical analyses produce largely consistent results (Tables 3-6), showing that the Li's with the highest RAMMP exhibit (on average) the highest yearly incidence rate. Moreover, for both epidemics, the behavior of the average incidence rate is monotonic, with respect to the RAMPPbased clustering (Fig. 6) , corroborating the idea that the RAMMP index that we propose can be effectively employed as criterion for the identification of high/low risk areas.",

During these two years, the KRT subway lines served around 60 million passengers per year, but the distribution of traffic volume was far from homogeneous. Indeed, the two busiest KRT stations in Kaohsiung, namely \"Kaohsiung Main Station\" and \"Zuoying\" (the latter of which links the KRT with the Taiwan High Speed Rail System), accounted for N 10 million passengers each per year. While the two least frequented ones (\"Qingpu\" and \"Qiaotou Sugar Refinery\") had around 650,000 passengers (data source: KCGSTAT, 2016) . The RAMPP serves the purpose of capturing such \"influence variation\", reflecting the simple but important idea that a large amount of passenger flow in and out of a station can dramatically increase the contagion risk in the neighborhoods. While on the other hand, a sporadically used station is unlikely to be able to substantially impact the spreading process.",

In the aftermath of 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, several countries such as Singapore and Taiwan introduced noncontact infrared thermometers (NCIT) at border control such as airports in order to detect febrile passengers, in an attempt to detect imported dengue cases or to delay the introduction of a novel influenza strain (Bitar et al., 2009) . A recent study in Taiwan indicates that in recent years, close to half of the imported dengue cases in Taiwan were detected at border every year (Fig. 7) , providing evidence for its effectiveness in detection of early cases. Epidemiologic investigation by Taiwan CDC indicates that almost 98% of the reported cases in Kaohsiung were infected locally in their Li of residence. Our study, showing the significant role that mass transportation system could play in dissemination of disease, would suggest that establishing similar NCIT sites at the busiest KRT stations could be very effective in early detection of dengue cases, and subsequently reduce local transmissions in the nearby communities.",

Secondly, the K-means method adopted to cluster the Li's based on their RAMPP value is strictly statistical. Further applications of the RAMPP index could conceivably help to better define its properties, and consequently resulting in a less \"aseptic\" clustering procedure. Moreover, a number of confounding factors could have influenced the results outlined here. In addition to the role of population density, which has already been addressed, the presence of popular meeting places (shopping malls, tourist spots, schools, etc.) or potential mosquito breeding sites in the vicinity of the KRT stations could have increased the infection rate in that areas, more than the traffic volume. However, unlike traffic volume, it is very difficult to quantify the number of people actually visiting those places (even on a yearly basis), and consequently the transmission risk. Furthermore, it is sensible to assume that the KRT stations are often located in the proximity of popular meeting places (or vice versa). Therefore, the RAMPP index, taking into account of the distance, could implicitly include this information as well as population density. In any case, the approach adopted in this paper is strictly empirical, as our aim is to highlight the statistically based relationship detected between dengue incidence and the RAMPP index, which can certainly be exploited for practical purposes by public health decision-makers.",

Public transportation system is just one of them and its weight can vary from one outbreak to another, as every year the conditions could change, magnifying or diminishing the impact of all the variables at play. Consequently, it would be unrealistic to expect from a straightforward quantifier, such as the proposed RAMPP, to be able to capture fully the intricate variability of each epidemic under any conditions. Despite these aforementioned limitations, the close similarity of the results obtained from data of two different years is a promising indication of the usefulness of our proposed index, and provides motivation to investigate its applicability through further studies. Enhancing our understanding of how public rapid transit system contributes to disease spread in densely populated urban areas, could be useful in the design of more effective and timely intervention and control measures for future outbreaks.",
