Theory proposes that at bifurcation points (i.e., tipping points), the stability of an equilibrium changes and the dominant real eigenvalue becomes zero. Consequently, the recovery rate from disturbance should go zero when approaching such bifurcation, or the return time (measure of resilience) should be infinity (Veraart et al. 2012) .

These p-values measure the significance levels for estimating these parameters: a p-value<0.05 indicating that the goodness-of-fitting to the model is statistically satisfactory from the perspective of the particular parameter. R 2 (R-squared) is of limited reference value for non-linear fitting problem, but it also confirmed the goodness-offitting as illustrated by the p-values for individual parameters. Obviously, the most important items in Table 1 are the I max and corresponding T max , the maximal infection number (eqn. 3) and the corresponding inflection time point (eqn. 4), respectively. Table 1 shows that PLEC fitted to virtually all datasets satisfactorily in terms of the p-values except for a few negligible parameter cases (p-value>0.05 in 4 out of 52). It should be noted that the 4 parameter cases that failed to pass significance tests only means that the parameter values may have too high standard error (variability) and the failure does not necessarily mean that the model structure failed.

The model for Gansu province also performed badly with error rates of 36%, apparently due to 33 inputs from the overseas between March 4 th and 8 th , approximately 1/3 of the total number in the province. These individual cases suggest that the PLEC modeling can be sensitive to certain disruptive increases, in particular, to the increases that occupy disproportionally large proportion of the total numbers. This may be considered as the first limitation of the PLEC model. On the positive side, excluding the inaccuracies from these disruptive increases as well as the individual cases of Taiwan and Tibet, the PLEC model actually performed exceptionally well, reaching success rates mostly exceeding 95%.",

From those failures, we conjecture that the failures are most likely due to the reality that in most of those countries (regions), the infections are still in the exponential growth stages. This, of course, suggests another possible limitation of the PLEC model, namely, the PLEC model may require a sufficiently long period of data points to successfully reveal the inflection points. Like all mathematical models, PLEC model is no silver bullet. Without seeing a sign of inflection point, it may not be possible for the PLEC model to reveal its existence.",

In other words, it is only applicable for detecting the inflection point for unimodal curve, as explained in the material and methods section. In the case of coronaviruses, this may not be an issue given that the SARS outbreak was also unimodal. In case of multiple-peak recurrence or seasonal outbreaks, it should be possible to divide multi-modal curve into multiple unimodal curves. Therefore, this limitation should be much less serious than it appears.",
