Individual actions, such as increased attention to hygiene and avoiding crowds, can reduce disease spread. Awareness also supports rapid identification and treatment of new cases and facilitates collective responses, such as closures of schools or transit systems 1 . In the modern world, diseases can move faster than ever due to the growing movement of people between cities, regions and countries. However, digital technology means information can move even faster, providing an opportunity for individuals and communities to protect themselves ahead of the disease itself arriving. 2 This study considers the spread, and persistence, of public awareness of the novel Wuhan coronavirus which emerged in late 2019. During the first few weeks of this outbreak there was little coverage from mainstream media outlets, providing an unusual opportunity to study the spread of awareness of an emerging disease via other channels.",

For example, in Hurricane Sandy in the USA, Twitter users with more followers had an awareness lead-time of up to 26 hours than less connected users 4 . Moreover, the magnitude of awareness increases over decreasing distances to the epidemic centers. For example, public awareness in Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, was two orders of magnitude stronger for the H7N9 influenza outbreak that occurred in China than the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak that occurred elsewhere 5 .",

In China, the outbreak of SARS between 2003 and 2004 caused a total of 7,429 reported cases and 685 deaths 6 , and had a lasting traumatic impact on survivors and communities 7, 8 . In this work, we set out to test whether public awareness of the new disease outbreak is related to social distance from the centre of the epidemic and past experience of the SARS epidemic in 2003. The SARS outbreak was 17 years ago, but its horror might still condition public awareness of lethal infectious diseases. To the best of our knowledge, few studies were carried out to understand how past severe outbreaks affect public awareness when a new outbreak occurs. This study estimates the post-SARS effect, called SARS memory effect, on the current outbreak.",

            "text": "We use the continuing Wuhan coronavirus outbreak as our case study to estimate the effects of social distance and SARS memory on the spread of public awareness. In late 2019, a new coronavirus, designated as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province 9 . As of February 1st, 2020, the virus has caused approximately 11,184 cases and 258 deaths in 21 countries with the majority of cases in mainland China 10 . The first symptoms were reported on December 1st, 2019 11 , but there was no solid evidence of human-to-human transmission until January 10 th , 2020, when a patient, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four family members 12 . However, there was little information available to the public until an official announcement about human-to-human transmission of the virus on January 20 th , 2020 13 . Wuhan City, long known as the \"Nine Provinces\" thoroughfare (\"\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862\"), is in the central part of China, serving as a major transportation hub transiting more than 120 million passengers every year 14 . The massive numbers of transits provided a perfect opportunity for the virus to spread. Another feature is the timing of the outbreak, close to the Spring Festival travel season, Chunyun (\"\u6625\u8fd0\"), which started on January 10 th , 2020. While the virus spread across almost all provinces, 16 cities had been locked down by January 23 rd , 2020 15 . Accordingly, this study focuses on the time period between December 15 th , 2019 and Jan 23 rd , 2020.",

In this study, we use the Baidu Search Index (BSI), available publicly at http://index.baidu.com, to measure the public awareness over time and locations (e.g., city). The total number of internet users using the Baidu search engine reached 649 million in 2014, accounting for 47.9% of the national population 16 . BSI has been used to predict epidemic outbreak 17 , HIV/AIDS incidence 18 and tourism flows 19 , suggesting BSI can provide a representative proxy for public awareness. BSI provides a weighted index for each search term. In this study, we used the term \"Wuhan pneumonia\" (\"\u6b66\u6c49\u80ba \u708e\"), as the public has widely used. We also tried \"novel coronavirus\" (\"\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\") and \"Wuhan outbreak\" (\"\u6b66\u6c49\u7206\u53d1\"), but the former did not exhibit a search surge, and the latter was not indexed by Baidu. Due to the privacy concern, Baidu masks daily readings that are below 57 as zero. Therefore, we used the maximum BSI value of the search term \"common cold\" (\"\u611f\u5192\") between Dec 10 th and 31 th , 2019, to control the size effect for each city. We use the Ljung-Box test 20 to estimate whether or not the daily readings of \"common cold\" are stationary. As a result, the daily readings of 18 out of 364 cities were found to be non-stationary, so they were excluded from this study. The magnitude of public awareness of the Wuhan outbreak over time and city \u2208 {1, \u2026 , 346} can be represented as The earliest day the magnitude of public awareness exceeds the arbitrary thresholds \u2208 {1.5, 2, 3, 4} is defined as the earliest warning day, ( ) , for city . We also define the starting day of Chunyun as \u210e , indicating the onset day when it is likely the virus would reach all cities. As Chunyun transited approximately 3 billion million passengers in 40 days in 2019 21 , crowded transport hubs create perfect opportunities for the virus to spread. Therefore, the earlier the lead-time awareness, the better for infection control. The lead-time of awareness for city is thus defined as:",

This is particularly relevant in the Chinese context, where migrant workers account for more than one-third of the working population 23 . We use the migration flows extracted from the Baidu Migration Matrix (BMM) to build a migration network ( Fig. 1 ). We then compute the shortest steps between any city to Wuhan, deriving the variable social distances for city as \u2208 (1, 8) .

From this study, we found that the spread of public awareness varies markedly across Chinese cities. Through controlling for development, administrative levels, and Euclidean distances, we observe cities that were struck by SARS and have more migration to the epicentre, Wuhan, showed earlier, stronger and more durable public awareness of the outbreak. Moreover, 48 cities had developed public awareness as early as Dec 31 st , 2019, with up to 19 days of lead-time advantage against some other 255 cities. The study suggests that memory of previous events, as well as social links to an emerging threat, may influence public behaviour. Greater awareness could help slow the spread of a disease, for example through increased attention to hygiene, mask-wearing and reduced interpersonal contact. It might also facilitate collective responses such as enforced quarantine measures. However, in some circumstances enhanced awareness could have negative impacts, such as unnecessary panic or ostracism of groups perceived as being at greater risk of infection",
