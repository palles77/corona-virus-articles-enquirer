It was framed by the science-technology-society (STS) teaching approach, and focused on collaboration between individual students, peers, teachers, agriculturists, and local experts. Students were assessed for their scientific inquiry ability at the beginning and the end of the learning process using five instruments: experimental skill test, students' laboratory reports, students' science projects, semi-structured interview and classroom observation. The results showed that the STS-based learning unit on biological control helped students gain significant improvement in scientific inquiry. They were able to apply and integrate the scientific knowledge learned in both classroom and field studies to help solve agricultural problems in their own communities. Moreover, this learning unit encouraged students' skills in solving problems in other situations.",

Learning is usually based on textbooks, laboratory manuals, and handouts rather than activities that support scientific inquiry skills. Laboratory activities do not represent good scientific models that support learning of science (Windschitl, 2004) . Many teachers still use the traditional approach in which students have to memorize and follow the step-by-step expositions which are not the way scientists do (Crawford, 1998 , as cited in Martin, 2003 . Scientific inquiry is a way that scientists use for explaining the natural world and it is also the fundamental practice of science (Bybee, 2004) . The teaching of scientific inquiry usually does not reflect authentic professionalism and thus distort the nature of science (Chinn & Mahotra, 2002; Park, Jang, & Kim, 2009) .",

Windschitl (2004) claimed that the process of scientific inquiry is not a linear one. The process of scientific inquiry must proceed as a cyclical process (Park, Jang, & Kim, 2009 ) during which students can check their understanding of scientific inquiry process by themselves and with their peers. As mentioned above, these scientific characteristics must bring about improvement of students' skills. It is anticipated that students in the future need to be more able to apply the scientific inquiry to solve the problems in their everyday lives and understand the scientific process related to their daily life and community. Students should also transfer the scientific knowledge from their class to the society and community.",

Each group of students observed and identified plant diseases and insect pests and collected data on the given work sheets. The students interviewed farmers about using pesticides, impact of pesticides on their plots, the environment, and humans. Each group of students digested the collected data and made presentation to their class. They then explored how to solve these agricultural problems with teachers, peers, and local sages. They conducted basic experiments on controlling plant diseases by using yeast and/or mold with guidance from the teachers. Fruit-bearing plants in their community such as guavas, mangoes, tomatoes, and eggplants were used in their experiments.",

The quantitative data are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Table 1 shows a comparison of pre/post administration of the EST between experimental and control groups. These findings showed no significant difference between experimental and control groups in the pre-EST, while in the post-EST both control and experimental groups there was a significance difference (p<0.001). For the experimental group, there was a statistically significant increase (p<0.001) in post-EST for each item. The laboratory reports of students in the STS context were evaluated by rubric scoring using the five components. The results showed highest average score was in the hypothesis (3.03) and results (3.03). The lowest score was in the discussion and conclusion (2.05), which indicated that some students drew a conclusion that was not supported by the data and their discussions are not adequate and incomplete. The science projects were evaluated by rubric scoring of the seven items. The results in Table 3 showed that most groups had high scores in the presentation component (4.40), knowledge transfer (4.20), and answering questions (4.00). The lowest score was in the discussion and conclusion (3.40). Moreover, the results from semi-structured interview supported the students' acquisition of scientific inquiry skills. Before intervention, students were confused about independent and dependent variables. They could not set a hypothesis and did not practice the scientific method because they had up to then only learned from lecture. After the intervention, students understood more about scientific inquiry: they could identify and control variables, formulate and test hypotheses, and collect and conclude data by themselves.",

We found that students involved in an STS-based learning unit on biological control had indeed shown significant improvement in scientific inquiry: they could use the process skills to solve problems, ask questions, formulate hypotheses, identify variables, and reach conclusions with their peers. Most importantly they were able to exploit the scientific method to identify and solve agricultural problems in their local community through the science project of their design. Success in promoting scientific skills through the STS approach is in agreement with several other reports. For example, Yager, Choi, Yager, and Akcay (2009) found that students taught with an STS approach had significantly higher science process skills, creativity, attitude, and ability to apply concepts in a new context, when compared to those taught by a directed approach. Dass and Deal (2007) found that students in an STS project gained scientific skills; i.e. taking specific action, designing, conducting and reporting experiments. Additionally, Akcay and Yager (2010) used an STS approach for improving students' ability to apply major science concepts and process skills in new situations. Students were well able to use the scientific method to conduct their science projects relevant to their community.",

            "text": "The key success in this study is in the activities in the learning unit that encouraged students to learn science process skills that help them think while they were discovering new things scientifically. In the STS classroom, the students were encouraged to identify their local agricultural problems and explore appropriate ways to solve them. They had the opportunity to observe and ask questions about the existing problems with local sages in their community. These activities encouraged students to learn and use scientific inquiry in situations that are close to real life. The findings that the STS approach calls for students to use the scientific method to learn and apply to their community is similar to those of Dass and Deal (2007) who employed STS approach to teach students through environmental projects, and found that students in STS projects could implement original action plan within the local community. Yager, Choi, Yager, and Akcay (2009) reported that science project in STS approach improved students' ability to solve problems identified in schools and the local communities. In our studies, the students had opportunity to work in the laboratory to practice the experimental skills needed for the subsequent science projects on real agricultural problems in their community. As a result, the students could apply the knowledge learned in designing and conducting the science projects on local problems. The activities in the science project helped promote science inquiry skills for students. They had to ask good questions, formulate hypotheses and design the methodology by themselves, collect and analyze data, discuss and conclude with their peers as scientists do. Results from evaluation of the science project as well as from classroom observation and semi-structured interview indicated that the students were able to act out the scientific method and possessed scientific inquiry skills. The finding in this study is in accordance with Roth and Roychoudhury (1993) that authentic contexts supported the scientific process skills. We can conclude that STS instruction provides the students with the ability to identify problems, seek scientific knowledge to solve real-life problems, and promote process skills in problem solving, as stated in NSTA (2007).",
