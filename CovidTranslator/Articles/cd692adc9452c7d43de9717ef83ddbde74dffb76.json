            "text": "The early events in the infection of human rectal tumor cells by bovine coronavirus were investigated by colloidal gold-mediated immunoelectron microscopy and by analysis of the effect of lysosomotropic weak bases on virus yield. Electron microscopic studies revealed sites of fusion between the virus envelope and the plasmalemma but fusion events along intracellular membranes were not observed despite extensive searches. Virion-antibody-colloidal gold complexes were, in fact, endocytosed by synchronously infected cells. These complexes were apparently non-infectious, and they accumulated in vacuoles that resembled secondary lysosomes. Exposure of cells to ammonium chloride or to methylamine during the first hour of infection had little inhibitory effect on the production of infectious virus. Chloroquine treatments were inhibitory but this effect depended on relatively late events in the infectious process. The chloroquine inhibitory step blocked infection of virus adsorbed to cells that were exposed to buffers in the pH range of 4.4 to 8.4. These findings indicate that BCV penetrates its host cell by direct fusion with the plasmalemma and does not require an acidic intracellular compartment for infectious entry.",

The BCV isolates studied in some detail agglutinate erythrocytes of rodents and thus belong to the hemagglutinating coronaviruses. Uniquely, the envelope of these coronaviruses has three glycoproteins. The peplomers consist of the E 1 membrane glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 24-26 kDa, the E2 glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 100-110 kDa which has cell fusion functions after cleavage from 185 kDa precursor [34] and the E3 hemagglutinin with a molecular mass of 65 kDa or its dimer of 126 kDa. Acetylesterase activity is associated with this hemagglutinin [38] . BCV replicates in absorptive epithelial cells of the intestinal tract in neonatal calves and induces serious enteric disease [11 ] . Although many features of coronavirus replication in cultured cells were described [10, 30, 32] , the early events of BCV infection remain poorly characterized.",

Some viruses penetrate the cell by direct fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. Paramyxoviruses, for example, fuse directly with the cellular plasma membrane under physiological conditions [28] . Other viruses fuse with plasma membranes only at a nonphysiological, low pH level [7, 8, 20, 40] . The second pathway for enveloped virus entry involves cellular uptake by endocytosis [8, [17] [18] [19] [20] . The endocytosed virions travel to membrane bound intracellular compartments where acidic conditions are maintained [25, 37] . The low pH of this cellular compartment apparently facilitates fusion between the viral envelope and the vesicle membrane and results in release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Infection of cultured cells by a variety of enveloped viruses can be blocked with lysosomotropic weak bases [-8, 9, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22, 24] . These bases accumulate in cells and alter the pH of acidic cellular compartments [21, 25] . This change apparently prevents low pH-dependent viral envelope fusion with the vesicle membrane and thus blocks infection [9] .",

The presence of these bases during the first hour of infection reduced BCV yields by 34 to 37%. Amantadine was a stronger inhibitor of virus yield but this inhibitory effect was also seen in control preparations. Thus, only chloroquine suppressed BCV replication during the first hour of infection. Infected cells that were exposed to 120gM chloroquine from the time of synchronous infection until harvest produced only 1.4% as much virus as did cultures treated with chloroquine 1 h post infection. Synchronously BCV infected monolayers were exposed to various doses of ammonium chloride and chloroquine at the time of temperature shift to avoid drug effects on the virus adsorption stage. A second set of monolayers was pretreated with the drugs for 15 rain and infected at 37 \u00b0C to ensure that intravacuolar pH levels were altered. The effects of the agents were similar for both infection protocols. Ammonium chloride reduced the yield of BCV in synchronously infected cells by less than 1 log-unit even at 20 mM levels (Fig. 5) . A similar unresponsiveness to ammonium chloride treatment occurred during infection at 37\u00b0C. Pretreatment with 10mM ammonium chloride decreased BCV by 37% from levels produced when the agent was added after a 1 h delay (Fig. 6) . Synchronous infection was strongly inhibited by 80 to 200 gM chloroquine (Fig. 7) . Cells pretreated with this base and infected at 37 \u00b0C also produced less virus with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor (Fig. 8 ). Exposure to chloroquine at the 120 gM level resulted in the optimal reduction in virus yield. Concentrations of the drug higher than 200 gM diminished total virus yield in 1 h delay treatments to levels obtained by pretreatment. The inhibitory effect of 120 gM chloroquine on the early stages of BCV replication was therefore examined more closely in subsequent experiments.",

Morphologic analyses have generally indicated that coronaviral entry is accomplished by endocytosis [3-5, 13, 26] ; yet other investigations suggested that coronaviruses enter the cell by direct fusion with the plasma membrane [6, 27] . One of the objectives of our study was to employ immunolocalization to investigate the entry pathway for BCV. Electron microscopic analysis revealed fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and confirmed that BCV particles were endocytosed by HRT-18 cells. Shortly after warming, virus particles were seen in coated pits and in small endocytic vesicles with smooth membranes. Viral particles accumulated later in structures with features of secondary lysosomes. These endocytic events resemble superficially an alternative mode for infectious entry of BCV. Goldlabeling of BCV particles was mediated by highly diluted neutralizing antibodies which did not reduce infectivity to a measurable extent. Some of the labeled virions probably represent non-infectious virus antibody-gold complexes. Their endocytosis would lead to sequestration in lysosomal compartments. However, this event appears to be irrelevant to infectious entry of BCV because we were never able to find clear morphologic evidence of fusion events along the intracellular membranes. This implies that BCV effects infectious entry by direct fusion at the cell surface.",

Our results virtually failed to reveal an unequivocal involvement of an acidic compartment.

Endocytosed viral particles reached lysosomes as early as 10min after infection but fusion with their membrane was not observed. Although amantadine treatment from the time of infection reduced virus yield, this base was also toxic when added after a 60-min delay.",

This effect apparently did not involve inhibition of viral envelope fusion with cell membranes. Besides raising the pH of lysosomes, chloroquine exerts other effects on cellular functions, including inhibition of viral RNA synthesis [2] . These effects may be responsible for the 6.5% drop in BCV production when the drug is added 1 h after rewarming. We probed the chloroquine sensitivity during the very early stages of BCV infection. The kinetics of time dependence for chloroquine inhibition lead us to conclude that a sensitive step in BCV replication occurs after 5 min of infection (Fig. 9) . Addition of chloroquine as late as 10 min after rewarming inhibits replication substantially [75] .",

Brief treatment of SFV-adsorbed cell cultures with low pH media lifted the chloroquine block apparently by inducing virus fusion at the plasma membrane [8, 39] . The chloroquine-blocked step in BCV infection was essentially unaffected by pH treatments in the range of 4.4 to 8.4. This failure to relieve the chloroquine block in BCV replication would be expected if plasma membrane fusion with BCV is not triggered by low pH treatments. This finding is in harmony with BCV-induced cell fusion in infected bovine fetal spleen cells which fused optimally at a slightly basic pH [27] , similar to a murine coronavirus-host cell system ]. An alternative explanation for a continued chloroquine block despite low pH treatment is inhibition of events in replication subsequent to fusion. Investigators of Sindbis virus infection concluded that chloroquine inhibits only postfusion events in the replication of this virus [2] . The inhibitory activity was attributed to an effect on viral RNA synthesis rather than a block in Sindbis virus entry into the cell.",

Endocytosis of this virus appears to represent an abortive infection with subsequent virus degradation in lysosomes. The virions that were endocytosed were not observed to fuse with the vesicle membrane. Instead, the particles accumulated in a somewhat degraded form in lysosome-like structures. Furthermore, a low pH compartment is apparently unnecessary for BCV infection and virusinduced membrane fusion seems to be an event independent of low pH treatments. These features suggest that BCV infects cells by direct fusion with the plasma membrane. Doughri et al. [6] observed interactions of BCV strain LY-t38 with the plasmalemma of infected intestinal epithelial cells and asserted that virus uptake had occurred by direct fusion with the plasma membrane. Our studies provide evidence to support that conclusion.",
