Acute inhalation injuries may present as inhalation fever or as acute tracheobronchitis and pneumonitis. Occupational asthma is the most frequent work-related respiratory disease. It may be caused by allergic sensitization to macromolecules of biologic origin or to chemicals of low molecular weight, as well as by (heavy) exposure to workplace irritants. The pneumoconioses are caused by the accumulation of dust particles or fibres in the lungs. They include silicosis, coal workers' pneumoconioses, asbestosis and other less common pneumoconioses. Chronic beryllium disease is caused by a cell-mediated sensitization to beryllium and resembles sarcoidosis. Hard-metal lung disease is caused by sensitivity to cobalt and resembles hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis is generally caused by sensitization to aerosolized biological antigens. Several types of infections may be related more or less specifically to work. Chronic obstructive lung disease is mainly caused by cigarette smoking, but exposure to dusts and gases contribute to its incidence. Similarly, bronchopulmonary cancer is not only caused by smoking, but also by occupational agents, most notably asbestos. Asbestos is also a cause of nonmalignant and malignant pleural disease.",

In many poorer countries, considerable numbers of workers are exposed to serious hazards associated with underground mining, various types of industry (metal, textile, wood, food, electronics, etc.) , construction, and agriculture. In industrially advanced countries, occupational lung diseases still occur as a consequence of working conditions of the past, but they also continue to occur, because occupational risks are still present in many jobs and novel risks emerge with the advent of new technologies.",

Exact figures of the incidence and prevalence of occupational lung disorders are often not available, even in countries where government agencies exist for reporting and compensating occupational diseases. This is due, in varying proportions, to legal and administrative restrictions in the eligibility for compensation, to a lack of obligation or incentive to notify occupational diseases, and to insufficient awareness, by physicians, of the possible occupational etiology of diseases in general. Thus, underreporting of occupational diseases is most likely to occur for pensioners, who are no longer at work, but whose condition may well be due to their previous job. However, even in working people, diagnoses of occupational disease, such as occupational asthma, are often missed for a variety of reasons. In various countries, schemes have been created for the voluntary reporting of occupational respiratory diseases by pneumologists and/or occupational physicians, for example, the Surveillance of Work Related and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD) system in the UK or the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR) Program, initiated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the US.",

Free crystalline silica (in practice, mainly quartz and cristobalite) is highly fibrogenic and leads to the formation of silicotic noduli. These lead initially to 'simple silicosis', characterized radiologically by small discrete opacities, and through coalescence they give rise to larger nodular opacities, characteristic of 'progressive massive fibrosis' (PMF).

It is characterized by nodular and/or coalescent opacities on chest X-ray. Symptoms are usually limited to dyspnea in advanced stages of the disease. Computed tomography better defines radiological abnormalities. Simple CWP has no significant effect on spirometric measures, whereas lung function in the more advanced stages of progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) shows an obstructive and restrictive pattern. Pathologically, simple CWP is associated with the macular and nodular lesions, whereas complicated CWP is associated with PMF (opacity lesion of 1 cm in diameter or more) and the lesions of rheumatoid pneumoconiosis. No specific treatment affects the course of CWP, though treatment options are available for complications such as tuberculosis and chronic hypoxemia. Supportive care includes bronchodilators in patients with obstructive syndrome, routine vaccination, antibiotics for exacerbations, and pulmonary rehabilitation.",

The prolonged inhalation of coal-mine dust may result in the development of coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP), silicosis, and industrial chronic bronchitis and emphysema, either singly or in various combinations. CWP is the term generally applied to interstitial disease of the lung resulting from chronic exposure to coal dust, whereas silicosis is due to inhalation of dust containing silica. The pneumoconioses differ in a number of ways from the acute allergic and toxic interstitial diseases that are associated with exposure to organic dusts, principally because of the long latency period (usually 10-20 years or more) between exposure and recognition of the disease. CWP was first recognized in Scottish miners in 1830. In recent decades, the incidence of CWP has been declining in industrial countries due to improved dust controls, though increased mechanization in the mid-1960s led to a temporary increase in dust levels in some countries. Over the period 1950-80, the annual UK rate for the recognition of CWP for state compensation in working and retired miners decreased from about 7% to 1-2%. The overall prevalence of CWP in US coal miners declined from about 12.7% to 3.9% between 1969 and 1988, but there were substantial regional differences. The overall prevalence of simple CWP is 2.8%; the highest rate of 14% occurs in workers with 30 years or more of mining experience. Similar regional differences and similar declines have been noted in the US and other countries.",

Coal is graded by rank, the rank reflecting its carbon content and thus coal quality and combustibility; anthracite is the highest ranked coal, with a carbon content of around 98%. Lower-ranked coals have carbon contents of around 90-95% carbon. The rank of coal has an influence on the risk of disease (higher-rank coals entail higher risk than lower-rank coals) and the progression of pneumoconiosis. Exposure to coal dust with a quartz concentration greater than 15% is associated with a high risk of a rapidly progressive form of pneumoconiosis that has the characteristics of silicosis. In open mines, dust levels rarely approach those of underground mines. Coal is currently actively mined in the US, UK, Western and Eastern Europe, India, China, South America, Australia, and Africa.",

The risk of pneumoconiosis is related to the intensity and years of exposure. However, among a group of workers exposed to the same dust, only a fraction develop pneumoconiosis, because of an individual susceptibility. The nature and properties of each specific dust constitute the third factor under consideration; for each mineral, geometric and aerodynamic properties, chemistry, and surface properties have to be considered. In order to cause pneumoconiosis, particles must be small enough (0.5-5 mm) to reach the respiratory bronchioles and be deposited there.",
