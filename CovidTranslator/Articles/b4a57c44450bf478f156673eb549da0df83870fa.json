            "text": "respiratory tract infection; rhinovirus; surveillance; epidemiology; colds Upper respiratory tract illness (URI) is the most common infectious disease of childhood and one of the most frequent reasons that parents seek medical care. 1 The first characterization of URI symptoms using modern virologic techniques was in the 1960s in young adults. 2 The frequency of URI in children and the nature and duration of respiratory symptoms has received increasing attention in the current era of molecular virology. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Historically, children have been reported to experience an average of 6 to 8 acute respiratory illnesses per year. 16 However, the number of URIs and the particular viruses involved vary with age, season, geography and attendance at out-of-home childcare. Previous studies have evaluated URIs in (1) birth cohorts of children at high risk for atopy 11, 12, 17, 18 or (2) crosssectional studies during a single respiratory season. 4, 5, 7, 15, 17 Only a few studies have prospectively followed substantial numbers of young children longitudinally, both when well and during symptomatic URI. [18] [19] [20] Although the frequency of acute otitis media as a complication of viral URI has been reported, there has been relatively little systematic investigation of the rate of sinusitis as a complication of URI. The single recent study investigating this question was performed in children 6 to 36 months of age. 9 In this age group, acute otitis media is a frequent early complication of URI (30-37%) that leads to antimicrobial treatment that, in turn, may prevent the subsequent development of acute bacterial sinusitis. 9, 19 To determine the rate of sinusitis complicating URI in children less susceptible to the confounding effects of otitis media, we prospectively studied the clinical, virologic, and epidemiologic characteristics of URIs in a population of 4 to 7 year old children in an observational cohort study.",

We determined sinusitis to be the most common complication of URI in this age group. Our estimated rate of sinusitis is similar to other studies examining sinusitis as a complication of URI in different populations of children. Wald et al examined 0-3 year old children attending childcare and determined the rate of sinusitis following URI to be 6.5-13%. 25 Marom et al reported a rate of 8% in a population of 6-35 month old children who were followed prospectively. 9 In both of these studies, the rate of sinusitis that was reported may have been blunted by the frequency of acute otitis media that is usually managed with antibiotics, which may have prevented the development of sinusitis. Ueda et al, basing the diagnosis of sinusitis on radiographic findings, found the rate of sinusitis to be 6.7% in 2-15 year olds with URI symptoms. 26 Two other observational studies of children with URI found rates of 8.3-17.3% in children presenting to clinic with respiratory symptoms. 27, 28 Our study determined the mean number of URIs per child per year. Although there was variation in our data with children acquiring from 0-9 URIs per year, the average of 1.3 was lower than expected. A classic study done in the 1950s, the Cleveland Illness in the Home study, found a rate of 6-7 \"common respiratory diseases\" per child per year in this age group. 16 This difference may be explained by changes in societal structure as reflected by an increase in childcare attendance by very young children. Early communal experiences may result in children developing more illnesses earlier in life and fewer illnesses in later years. Three other recent studies provide contradictory results. Revai et al and Byington et al found a rate of approximately 0.5 illnesses per month in children less than five years of age. 20, 29 These children were followed in a similar fashion to children in our investigation but were younger. In a household surveillance study, Monto et al reported a rate of 0.6 URIs per respiratory season in children 5-17 years old. 8 Although children in the Monto study were only followed during the respiratory virus season, it is safe to say that children had fewer than one acute respiratory illness per year. These differences almost certainly relate to variation by age group, season and geography.",

For example, as is well known, fever was seen more often in association with FLU and less often with RV illnesses. In addition, the probability of symptomatic illness was related to RV species. The risk of URI was greatest with RV-C and then RV-A, but RV-B was not significantly associated with illness, which is in agreement with previous findings in infants. 11 RVs were most prevalent in the spring and fall but were detected continuously throughout the year, whereas most other viruses had a more seasonal pattern.",

            "text": "Symptom scores were followed closely during URIs; scores peaked on day three and 72% of episodes were improved or resolved by the 10 th day after onset. Pappas et al studied URIs in school-aged children and found that 40% of children were symptomatic through day 9, although most were improving. 34 Likewise, similar to our results, a study of children seeking care for URI in the United Kingdom had a rate of persistent symptoms of 7% at two weeks. 35 This study has several limitations which may limit generalizability. First, by design, the children included in this study were of a fairly narrow age group (4-7 years), as this is the age with the peak incidence of clinical episodes of sinusitis. URIs in infants and older children may have different characteristics and different viral antecedents. 9 Second, the population studied was largely Caucasian and well-educated, reflecting the demographics of our Midwestern city. Third, the actual rate of URIs per child may be somewhat higher than we reported. Our study coordinators called families each month to encourage reporting of URIs and samples often were obtained at home visits for the convenience of the participants. Despite these efforts, it is possible that some URIs, particularly those of mild severity, might have been missed. Studies relying on self-report of URIs can underestimate the frequency of illnesses. 12 Lastly, nasal rather than nasopharyngeal samples were used to identify viruses, which may have overestimated the rate of RV and underestimated the role of parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, influenza and RSV.",
