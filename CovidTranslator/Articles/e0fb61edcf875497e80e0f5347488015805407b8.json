Methods: Based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle using 5-[(2\u00b4-aminoethyl)-amino] naphthelenesulfonic acid (EDANS) and 4-[[4-(dimethylamino) phenyl] azo] benzoic acid (Dabcyl) as the energy transfer pair, one fluorogenic substrate was designed for the evaluation of SARS-CoV 3CL pro proteolytic activity. Results: The kinetic parameters of the fluorogenic substrate have been determined as K m =404 \u00b5mol\u00b7L -1 , k cat =1.08 min -1 , and k cat /K m =2.7 mmol -1 \u00b7L\u00b7min -1 . SARS-CoV 3CL pro showed substantial pH and temperature-triggered activity switches, and site-directed mutagenesis analysis of SARS-CoV 3CL pro revealed that substitutions of His 41 , Cys 145 , and His 163 resulted in complete loss of enzymatic activity, while replacement of Met 162 with Ala caused strongly increased activity. Conclusion: This present work has provided valuable information for understanding the catalytic mechanism of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . This FRET-based assay might supply an ideal approach for the exploration SARS-CoV 3CL pro putative inhibitors.",

Coronavirus (CoV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus and involves the largest viral RNA genome known to date.

It is known that the replicase gene features the sequence motifs of both papain-like protease and 3-chymotrypsin like pro-tease (3CL pro ) [9, 10] . 3CL pro , which is also called main protease, functions as a key protease to control the activities of coronavirus replication complexes.",

            "text": "It has been concluded from previous research data that 3CL pro -mediated processing pathways are conserved in coronaviruses. Coronavirus main proteases employ cysteine and histidine residues as the catalytic dyad in the catalytic site but lack a corresponding third catalytic site [5, [11] [12] [13] , which is an acidic residue in chymotrypsin. Previous research has also confirmed that substrate specificities for the coronavirus main proteases are well defined, with the known proteolytic sites involving bulky hydrophobic residues (mainly leucine/ isoleucine) at the P2 position, conserved glutamine at the P1 position, and small aliphatic residues at the P1' position [14, 15] . In addition, secondary structural studies for substrates of SARS-CoV 3CL pro have revealed that substrates with more beta-sheet like structures tend to be cleaved quickly [16] . The determination of the crystal structures for human coronavirus (strain 229E) 3CL pro and the inhibitor complex of porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV) 3CL pro also confirmed a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate binding sites for coronavirus 3CL pro [17] . The recently reported crystal structures of SARS-CoV 3CL pro and its complex with an inhibitor revealed substantial pH-dependant conformational changes that correlate well with the varying activity of 3CL pro at different pH levels, and an unexpected model of inhibitor binding [18] . In fact, it has already been shown that 3CL pro is an ideal target for screening anti-virus agents [15, 19, 20] . Like other 3CL pro , SARS-CoV 3CL pro might become an attractive target in discovering new agents for the treatment of SARS [17] .",

In fact, the fluorescence-based assay is another method for quantitative protease activity assay, eg fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been successfully used to develop spectrophotometric assays for many proteases [23] [24] [25] . The FRET-based method is more sensitive and less timeconsuming compared with the RP-HPLC technique. Recently, a fluorogenic 14-amino acid peptide has been reported to measure SARS-CoV 3CL pro enzymatic activity [26] . In the present report, we describe how this methodology can be used to design a 12-amino acid fluorogenic peptide with EDANS/ Dabcyl as the fluorescence quenching pair. This fluorogenic substrate has been successfully used to characterize the proteolytic activities of wild type SARS-CoV 3CL pro at different pH levels and temperatures, and its four site-directed mutants including two catalytic residues and two substrate-binding sites as well. To our knowledge, such a fluorescence-based assay is the first to be used for sitedirected mutation analysis of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . We hope that this present FRET-based assay will supply an ideal platform for the exploration of SARS-CoV 3CL pro putative inhibitors.",

N \u03b1 -tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected amino acids were used in all coupling steps. The base liable-protecting group, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc), was used for the protection of the side chain of lysine, while the benzyl (Bzl) group was employed for the protection of C-terminal carboxyl group of the peptide. The Boc protecting group was removed before coupling by using HCl 4 mol/L in dioxane. Peptide couplings were achieved by overnight reaction with 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF). After completion of synthesis, the benzyl group was removed by hydrogenolysis in methanol. The commercially available 5-[(2\u00b4-aminoethyl)amino] naphthelenesulfonic acid (EDANS) and 4-[[4-(dimethylamino) phenyl] azo] benzoic acid (Dabcyl) groups were attached to the peptides with conventional condensation reactions [28] , and the Fmoc group was removed from the lysine \u03b5-amine group by treatment with piperidine-N,Ndimethylformamide (1:1 v/v) to give the final fluorogenic substrate. The crude products were purified by means of HPLC on a Kromasil 7-\u00b5m C 8 column (25 mm\u00d7250 mm). The purity of the final products was evaluated by reversedphase HPLC on a Kromasil 5-\u00b5m C 8 column (4.6 mm\u00d7250 mm). The integrity of the purified peptides was determined by LCQ-DECA mass spectrometry (Thermofinnigan, San Jose, CA), and the observed molecular mass was found to agree with the calculated value.",

A 12-amino acid peptide representing the NH 2terminal autoprocessing site of TGEV 3CL pro with the sequence of substrate-analog chloromethyl ketone inhibitor Cbz-Val-Asn-Ser-Thr-Leu-Gln-CMK was devised to separate the quencher from the fluorescent donor chromophore for designing the fluorogenic substrate in this study ( Figure  1A ), considering that a published cleavage experiment found that a 15-amino acid substrate involving these sequences could be efficiently cleaved by SARS-CoV 3CL pro [17] . To ensure efficient internal quenching, a commercially available donor/quencher pair was chosen for this study: 5-[(2\u00b4aminoethyl)-amino] naphthelenesulfonic acid (EDANS) and 4-[[4-(dimethylamino) phenyl] azo] benzoic acid (Dabcyl) ( Figure 1B) .

A typical Lineweaver-Burk plot is shown in Figure 4 , which plots the reciprocal of the initial velocity (v 0 ) versus the reciprocal of the substrate concentration. The data for each concentration were ob- tained in triplicate. The calculated K m and k cat values were 404\u00b19 \u00b5mol/L and 1.08\u00b10.14 min -1 , respectively. Obviously, the relatively small k cat /K m value (2.7\u00b10.3 mmol -1 \u00b7L\u00b7min -1 ) indicated that the in vitro activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro was low, in common with other reported coronavirus 3CL pro [5] . Such a low activity for SARS-CoV 3CL pro may be due to the fact that only the dimer of 3CL pro was the active form, and efficient active dimeric form was often at relatively low concentrations during the enzyme assay [16, 26] . Figure 5 showed the results concerning the relative enzymatic activity at various pH values for SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The protease exhibited a stable proteolytic activity at pH 7.0-x9.0, and displayed only 50% activity at pH 6.0 and 10.0. However, when pH decreased to 5.0, it almost lost its activity completely. These results were strongly supported by a recent study, which discussed the pH dependence and the catalytic mechanism of SARS-CoV 3CL pro [31] . The pH profile shown in Figure 5 can be fitted by the following equation [32] :",

The reaction velocity (v 0 ) was determined in citric acid/phosphate buffer (pH=5, 6, 7, 8) or glycine/NaOH buffer (pH=9, 10). The curve was fitted by an equation described by Copeland [32] using ORIGIN 7.0. As shown in Table 2 , the proteolytic activity of this mutant dropped below the detection limit of the enzyme assay. Such an obvious indispensability of His 163 for proteolytic activity supported the conclusion that His 163 remained uncharged at physiological pH to facilitate optimal interaction with the Gln-P1 of the substrate in substrate-binding subsite S1 as determined by the recently reported crystal structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro [18] . This was also consistent with the mutagenesis data obtained previously for the same His residue in other CoV 3CL pro [36] . Secondly, when Met 162 residue was substituted with Ala, it was found that such a mutation did not decrease the proteolytic activity. On the contrary, it exhibited strongly increased activity: almost double compared with the wild type SARS-CoV 3CL pro . This result was consistent with the corresponding research for FIBV 3CL pro [36] , and indicated that Met 162 was not indispensable for proteolytic activity even though it was conserved among CoV 3CL pro . It was tentatively suggested that such an increase of proteolytic activity for SARS-CoV 3CL pro caused by Met 162 mutation might be due to the fact that the substitution changed the spatial properties of the substrate-binding subsite S1 and facilitated substrate binding. In summary, in this report, based on FRET theory, a fluorogenic substrate for detection of proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro was successfully synthesized and evaluated. The kinetic parameters showed that the in vitro activity of SARS 3CL pro was relatively low, perhaps due to the low concentration of the active dimeric form under the enzyme assay conditions. The pH profile of enzymatic activity yielded pK a1 and pK a2 values of 6.2 and 10.0, respectively, which correlated well with the finding that ionization of the catalytic dyad of His 41 and Cys 145 was perhaps vital during the catalytic processing of substrate hydrolysis. In addition, SARS-CoV 3CL pro displayed nearly a twofold increase in activity with every 10 \u00baC increase at 10-40 \u00baC, and diminished its activity significantly at 50 \u00baC owing to thermal denaturation. Mutation analysis revealed that substitution of either His 41 and Cys 145 residues resulted in complete loss of proteolytic activity, which was also observed for the residue His 163 in the substrate-binding subsite S1. Replacement of Met 162 with Ala caused increased activity, although the detailed mechanism was still unknown. The present FRET-based assay might supply an ideal platform for the exploration of SARS-CoV and other CoV 3CL pro putative inhibitors, given the conserved substrate specificities of CoV 3CL pro . ",
