            "text": "Much of the uncertainty about the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic stems from questions about when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) by governments, in particular social distancing measures, are implemented, to what extent the population complies with these measures, and how compliance changes through time. Further uncertainty comes from a lack of knowledge of the potential effects of removing interventions once the epidemic is declining. By combining an epidemiological model of COVID-19 for the United Kingdom with simple sub-models for these societal processes, this study aims to shed light on the conceivable trajectories that the pandemic might follow over the next 1.5 years. We show strong improvements in outcomes if governments review NPI more frequently whereas, in comparison, the stability of compliance has surprisingly small effects on cumulative mortality. Assuming that mortality does considerably increase once a country's hospital capacity is breached, we show that the inherent randomness of societal processes can lead to a wide range of possible outcomes, both in terms of disease dynamics and mortality, even when the principles according to which policy and population operate are identical.. Our model is easily modified to take other aspects of the socio-pandemic interaction into account.",

            "text": "The use of detailed simulation modelling to assess the potential outcomes of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its associated disease, COVID-19, has produced crucial information for policy makers and healthcare managers, most notably in the UK where a detailed modelling study (Ferguson et al. 2020 ) has led to a significant change in government policy regarding the pandemic (Gallagher 2020) . The model used, an adaptation of one that was previously used to model potential influenza pandemics (Ferguson et al. 2006) , is a complex individual-based simulation with many thousand lines of code which are not yet available openly ( Tweet from @neil_ferguson 22nd March 2020 ). While such models can make accurate predictions for given assumptions on individual behaviour, their computationally intensive nature means that they do not easily capture a major source of uncertainty determining disease dynamics: when and how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as social distancing measures are enacted by governments and how the population change their behaviour as a result. To address this aspect of the problem, we propose to use simpler models and perform \"Management Strategy Evaluation\" (MSE: (Bunnefeld, Hoshino & Milner-Gulland 2011; Punt et al. 2016) , an adaptive framework for comparing multiple management strategies in a variety of circumstances. Originally developed for assessing fisheries management schemes, this framework has the potential to be applied widely for assessing best practice in other important management scenarios (Bunnefeld et al. 2011 ) .",

Responses to COVID-19 have varied widely between nations in both the speed and the stringency of the interventions used (Hale & Webster 2020) . South Korea, for example, intervened very quickly once the first cases were reported whereas the response has been considerably slower in countries such as the UK and the USA (Fig. 1) . It is likely that the continuing response to the pandemic will also vary between nations, with different governments choosing to relax the stringency of their interventions at different stages of epidemic decline. The importance of early intervention at the start of a pandemic to reduce mortality is well known, but there has been little assessment to date of the effects of removing management interventions at different points once the epidemic in a particular nation or area has started to decline.

Further interventions seek to change behaviour to reduce the probability of infection per contact by, for example, emphasising the importance of frequent hand-washing and by isolating potentially infectious cases. Compliance with these interventions will vary between individuals depending on a wide variety of factors, and because of the restrictive nature of the interventions it is likely that compliance will decay over time, especially if the public perception is that the risk is low or the epidemic is declining. This decline in compliance has been found in a number of studies of public behaviour, notably during recent influenza epidemics in Hong Kong (Liao et al. 2019) , Malaysia (Wong & Sam 2010) and the Netherlands (de Zwart et al. 2010) .

The factors determining how an individual's behaviour changes with respect to an epidemic threat will include the degree of perceived risk and the perceived benefits from a particular behavioural change (Yan et al. 2018) , cultural and religious beliefs, expectations and norms and the interaction between an individual and both traditional news media and social media influences.

Thus infected individuals belong to one of the four classes Ia1, Ia2, Is1, and Is2. We include in the R stage both immune individuals and fatalities. We simulate disease dynamics in discrete, 24h time steps, applying methods of matrix population dynamics (Caswell 2006) . Disease mortality is computed using a separate model (see below). We assume a total initial total population size of N = 66\u00b710 6 , representative of the United Kingdom (UK). We seeded the model with 10 asymptomatic early stage individuals, i.e., we start with S = N -10, I s1 = 10, I a1 = 10, I s2 = 0, I a2 = 0, using Italic symbols to represent population numbers in corresponding stages.",

The relation between the basic reproduction number R 0 and the linear growth rate r 0 (or corresponding doubling time) of a disease is known to depend sensitivity on the statistical distribution of the time intervals between transmissions, which our model does not represent well. We therefore compute R 0 indirectly by first determining r 0 from our model and then computing R 0 = ( 1 + r 0 T gen / \u237a ) \u237a , where T gen = 6.5 days is the mean generation time (i.e. time between transmission) following Ferguson et al.

We then decomposed L = F + S , where F (\"fertility matrix\") represents transitions between stages involving new infections and S (\"survival matrix\") all other transitions. We then computed r 0 (in units of day -1 ) as ln(\u03bb) and T gen (in days) as 1 + ( v T Sw )/( v T Fw ) (Bienvenu & Legendre 2015) . The fitted value for infection rate as defined above is 1.026 day -1 , and for the recovery rate 0.149 day -1 . From the policy perspective, the linear growth rate r 0 of the disease and the delays implied by the mean generation time T gen are crucial parameters. Using this procedure, we ensure our model reproduces them well.",

Current estimates for case fatality for COVID-19 vary widely between countries (Oke & Heneghan) , which might partially be attributable to this effect. To model the effect of hospital overload on mortality, we assume that 4.4% of cases will be hospitalized (Ferguson et al. 2020) , that 30% of hospitalized cases require critical care (Ferguson et al. 2020) , including ventilators. The number of required ventilators is then computed as the resulting number of cases requiring ventilators, times the ratio between mean duration of critical care -10 days (Ferguson et al. 2020 ) -and mean duration of infections, which equals mean incubation time plus the inverse recovery rate. We take the number of available ventilators to be 8175 (Parmenter 2020) . For the proportion of cases below or reaching critical care capacity we assume a case fatality rate of 0.9%, for cases exceeding hospital capacity a case fatality rate of 9%. Based on these considerations, we compute an effective case fatality rate CFR as a weighted average of these two figures and obtain the number of deaths at a given day in the model as the increment of R for this day multiplied by effective CFR.",

The tenfold lower threshold in Rule 2 assumes extra caution when measures are relaxed. The range (0.5, 1) of f values in Rule 1 is motivated by effects of individuals NPI on disease dynamics computed by (Ferguson et al. 2020 ) under the assumption of full compliance and the consideration that in reality compliance with new measures and their effectiveness are difficult to predict.

To represent these effects and their intrinsic uncertainty, we superimpose the immediate effects of policy responses on d t with a random walk with drift for ln( d t ) with dynamics that slow down as d t approaches zero. Specifically we set d t+ 1 = min[1, d t+ \u00bd exp( -d t+ \u00bd \u03b4 ) ], where \u03b4 is a normally distributed random number with mean \u03bc = 1/120 and standard deviation \u03c3 = 1/30.

This herd immunity can lead to removal of all or most NPI after the outbreak. In other cases, case numbers remain high for a long time (Fig. 4d ).

Our model takes into consideration that policy responses are the result of complex deliberative processes that may not always be perfectly timed, and that the effectiveness of individual NPI, both at the time they are introduced and while they are maintained, can be difficult to predict. For the example of the UK we found that, as a result of these uncertainties only, there is considerable variability in the potential development of the COVID-19 outbreak and the number of lives it could take. In view of this inherent variability, it should not be a surprise that COVID-19 outbreaks in different countries are taking quite different forms, even when their governments and societies are working in similar ways.",

The reason for this is that in our model governments can counteract declining compliance by introducing new regulatory measures once the number of infections raises again. In practice this might simply involve reinforcing messages about the importance of compliance and/or increasing enforcement of the existing measures: during previous influenza pandemics declines in compliance have coincided with reductions in reported cases and deaths and associated media coverage (Lau et al. 2003; Wong & Sam 2010) . This result is reassuring, given the scarcity of systematic knowledge about how compliance with NPI changes through the course of an epidemic.",

In both cases the information available about the biological system to be managed is incomplete, there is substantial inherent randomness, and yet the biological process itself is in principle well understood. Uncertainty about management outcomes therefore depends to a large part on the nature of management measures and the logic according to which they are applied. Management strategy evaluations, i.e. the modelling of the interactions between biological system and management, can then be useful for comparing the long-term implications of different management strategies.",

On the other hand, our model did not consider the uncertainty decision makers face regarding the actual number of infected individuals at a given time.
