Fluidigm Dynamic Array nanofluidic chip 96.96 was used to analyze the mRNA expression of 21 TRP genes and two control genes. Data was analyzed using the BioMark digital array software. Determinations of relative gene expression values were carried out by using the 2 -DDCt method (normalized threshold cycle (Ct) value of sample minus normalized Ct value of control). TCID 50 / ml (tissue culture infectious dose that will produce cytopathic effect in 50 % of the inoculated tissue culture cells) was found for treatments to determine the viral loads. The inflammatory cytokine IL-8 level was found to increase for both 24 and 48 h time points following Ns extract treatment. TRPA1, TRPC4, TRPM6, TRPM7, TRPM8 and TRPV4 were the genes which expression levels changed significantly after Ah, Ns or Cs extract treatments. The virus load decreased when any of the Ah, Ns or Cs extracts was added to the CoV infected cells with Ah extract treatment leading to undetectable virus load for both 6 and 8hpi. Although all the extract treatments had an effect on IL-8 secretion, TRP gene expression and virus load after CoV infection, it was the Ah extract treatment that showed the biggest difference in virus load. Therefore Ah extract is the best candidate in our hands that contains potential treatment molecule(s).",

Chamomile is regularly used in tea making and to relieve stomachache and digestive system problems. Chamomile was shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and to decrease wound healing time [28] . Antimicrobial activity of different species in the genus of Anthemis have been documented [29] . Twenty-four different components were characterized in Ah extract. The major components were carvacrol (38.4 %) and a-pinene (30.9 %) [30] .",

IL-8 levels increased following treatment by Ns, Ah and Cs extracts for both 1/50 and 1/100 dilutions at 24 h. However IL-8 levels had decreased at 48 h for Ah and Cs treated cells. This suggests that Ns extract was better at stimulating IL-8 secretion from infected cells to lead to a bigger inflammatory response. When IL-8 levels were measured following plant extract treatment of infected cells 6 and 8 h post-infection it was found that IL-8 levels were below the lowest standard and very low (Supplementary figure) .

Subsequently, the cells were infected with CoV for 6 h postinfection and 8 h. mRNA expression levels for TRP channel families were investigated by using fluidigm RT PCR. GAPDH expression was used for normalization of gene expression. Uninfected cells were used as a negative control. The infected but not plant extract exposed cells were used as positive control. The expressions of TRP genes were evaluated 6 and 8 h post-infection. These time points were chosen because CoV shows its cytopathic effects by 8 h post-infection [43] . The changes in the expression levels were determined by calculating fold-changes (2 -DDCt ) for the TRP genes and normalizing them by dividing with the fold-change for the control gene GAPDH.",

IL-8 secretion was increased at 24 h for Ns and Ah extract treatments but Cs treatment did not show a significant increase in IL-8 secretion at 24 h. However, IL-8 secretion was very low at early time points after infection (Fig. 3) . Therefore it is not known if IL-8 levels are related to a decreased virus load. Following gene expression analysis the TRP genes with changed expression levels were identified as follows: TRPM6 and TRPA1 were the two genes that were down regulated for both 6 and 8 h time points in CoV infected and extract treated cells, TRPC4 gene was down regulated following Ns and Ah treatments for both 6 and 8 h time points, TRPM7 was down regulated only after Ns treatment for the two time points, TRPV4 gene was down regulated following Ah treatment for the two time points and TRPM8 was down regulated following Cs treatment for the two time points.",

Together with the data showing that virus loads were decreased upon extract treatments we predicted that TRP genes might be involved in CoV survival inside cells. Considering that replication of other viruses were related to intracellular calcium concentration and TRPs modulate ion concentrations, including calcium we measured intracellular calcium concentrations and found that they increased following plant extract treatments of infected cells. The controversial TRP gene expression and calcium concentration results suggest that they may not be related to decreased viral loads in plant extract treated infected cells or decreased TRP gene expression and/or increased calcium concentration decrease viral loads through unknown mechanisms. Undetectable levels of the virus after Ah treatment can mean a specific factor being involved following that treatment and this factor can be the TRPV4 gene, whose expression went down only in the case of Ah treatment for both 6 and 8 h time points. Currently there is no literature tying TRP genes to viral survival.",
