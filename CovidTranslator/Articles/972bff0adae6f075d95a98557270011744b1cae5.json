Since then, US rates of recall and biological product deviation for blood components have improved significantly, particularly with regard to reduced recalls for donor infectious disease risks or testing. However, analysis of the current data from the US Food and Drug Administration suggests that 1 (0.4%) in 250 blood components is involved in market withdrawals and quarantines, with 1 in 5800 components formally recalled. Most of these units, unfortunately, had already have been transfused. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued several recent guidances that address transfusion service actions for dealing with specific infectious disease problems. This present article updates our 2004 recommendations as to when to notify physicians about transfused nonconforming blood components.",

The 2011 figures were significantly less than were reported in previous years, with the bulk of this decline coming from a reduction in the number of infectious disease problems. The combined numbers of units with infectious disease issues-incorrect testing, past or present positive donor test results, or possible bacterial contamination-declined from more than 7000 units annually in the 1990s to less than 500 in 2011.

This figure included all available whole blood/red blood cell (RCB) units plus all non-RBC components produced and subtracted the RBC and non-RBC components, which outdated at blood centers. We counted whole blood-derived (WBD) platelets as individual units, not pools; the proportion of WBD platelets issued as prepooled doses from blood centers (and therefore subject to recall as 1 unit, not 5) was not given in the survey. Using this denominator, the recall rate for the annualized 2011 data was 1 in 5800 units, one-third of the rates seen in earlier years. To the extent that prepooled WBD platelets would reduce this denominator, the rate would be somewhat higher.",

These modified rules incorporated donor nucleic acid testing (NAT). The FDA issued a May 2010 guidance on donor HIV and HCV NAT, which included test result algorithms on which donors needed to have a lookback performed and a December 2010 guidance on performing HCV lookback [16, 17] . In some cases, donors with ambiguous HIV NAT results must still have lookbacks performed as a precaution. All historical lookbacks on donors identified before February 2008, which permitted the hospital transfusion service 1 year to trace and notify recipients, were to have been completed by 2009. For current lookbacks, the consignees have 12 weeks to make reasonable attempts to complete their notifications. However, the CMS rule says if the hospital cannot locate the recipient, it can document in the patient medical record extenuating circumstances beyond the hospital's control as to why more than 12 weeks was needed [14] . Either the patient or the physician of record can be notified by the transfusion service or the hospital, but in either case, the recipient must be notified, according to commentary accompanying the rules changes [13] . For deceased recipients of HIV lookback units (in case of potential exposure to others) and for legally incompetent or minor recipients, the next of kin or legal representative must be notified. These rule changes also increased the FDA requirement for record retention of all blood component dispositions from 5 to 10 years [12, 18] .",

More than 150 000 prospective donors are deferred annually in the United States for malaria risk travel [45] . The CDC has added information about deferring blood donations to the malaria section of its Yellow Book for travel medicine [46] . However, unrecognized malaria risk travel is still the most common single reason for BPDs in blood components (Fig 1) . Donor travel to Mexico has been scrutinized in recent years. Malaria (Plasmodium vivax) has drastically declined in Mexico from historical levels, with reported cases down 98% from 1985 to 2005. Although Mexican travel is probably the most common locale for malaria deferrals in US donors, detailed analysis of local malaria infections by the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II group showed that three-fourths of US donors deferred for Mexican travel went to areas where little or no local malaria is occurring, such as Quintana Roo (Cancun and Cozumel region, Yucatan peninsula) [45] . The FDA Blood Products Advisory Committee recommended in 2009 to lift the deferral for travelers to rural Quintana Roo, and the FDA's June 2012 draft guidance would do so, if adopted [20, 45] . The Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II group estimated that with the exception of Oaxaca, which accounted for less than 3% of US donor deferrals for Mexican travel, the risk of malaria transmission from US blood donors returning from Mexico might be around 1 unit every 20 years nationwide [45] . Given this low probability, in our practice, we are not notifying the transfused patient's physician when Mexico is the donor's travel risk.",

Then a \"tail\" of lower-level viremia has been detected for up to 3 months [68] . Donors could be infectious but NAT negative in the early or late stages of this sequence, depending in part on test sensitivity, for example, switching to more sensitive individual-donor NAT when infections are identified locally. Whole blood specimens are under investigation for donor testing because they have higher WNV levels than plasma in the convalescent phase [68] .

Donors who generated BPDs with postdonation information are more likely older, male, and more educated than deferred donors [72] .

Better yet would be an interactive database for organizing and searching public information on these and all other recalls. 2. Improve donor screening. Numerous problems have been identified that may contribute to false-negative deferral screening, but demonstrations of successful interventions are scarce. Better screening might even reduce unnecessary deferrals, as was observed in one malaria travel project [87] . 3. Improve processes to notify transfusion services and transfusing physicians. The Canadian analysis indicated needs for better communications to hospitals about problems with donors or components [41] . When there are infectious disease concerns about a donor, supplying information on whether the donor was subsequently tested and the most recent results, if any, is a simple but helpful measure. 4. Improve knowledge of the medical consequences of transfusing nonconforming blood components. Other than HIV/HCV lookback, little information has been collected on the outcomes in transfusion recipients or the concerns of their physicians. 5. Use outcomes knowledge from recipients to better inform the donor screening process. This would help complete the quality improvement loop from donors to recipients and back to donors again.
