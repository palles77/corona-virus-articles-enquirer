For example, one study was conducted with transgenic mice engineered to overexpress IB\u2423 in endothelial cells alone (10) . Overexpression of IB\u2423 blocks the activation of NF-B, which, when allowed to activate, translocates to the nucleus and leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. When these mice were subjected to Escherichia coli sepsis, selective blockade of endothelial NF-B activation via overexpression of IB\u2423 had no effect on the appearance of sys-temic cytokines and chemokines, but it prevented the development of endothelial dysfunction and multiorgan failure and improved survival (10) .

However, in patients with sepsis-related acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intensive-care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation, randomized controlled trials of statin treatment have shown no improvement in survival (15) . In these patients, statin treatment was probably \"too little, too late.\" To be effective, statins probably have to be started earlier, as suggested by the findings of a randomized controlled trial of 100 patients hospitalized with early sepsis (16) . At the time of enrollment, none of the patients had evidence of organ failure and all had been statin naive for at least 2 weeks. As soon as they were hospitalized, they were treated with either atorvastatin (40 mg/day) or a placebo.

Favipiravir is a nucleoside polymerase inhibitor that in vitro and animal studies have shown to have antiviral activity against Ebola viruses. In 69 PCR-positive adults and adolescents of \u054614 years of age, a loading dose of favipiravir (6,000 mg orally) was given in divided doses on day 1, and then 1,200 mg was given twice a day for the next 9 days. Ebola virus loads were determined by cycle threshold (C T ) values, with C T values of \u03fd20 and \u054620 indicating high and low virus loads, respectively. Mortality rates after 14 days in consecutively treated patients were compared with those in untreated patients seen in the two units during the previous 3 months. Among favipiravirtreated patients with low virus loads, mortality was 15%, compared with 30% in historical controls. However, among treated patients and historical controls with high virus loads (approximately 40% of all treated patients), mortality rates in both groups were 85%. Although this study is not definitive, it suggests that antiviral treatment of Ebola patients might yield only modest improvements (\u03fd20%) in overall survival.",

The agreement did not stipulate that signed informed consent be obtained from each patient because it was assumed that physicians and the government would be acting in the best interests of their patients.

It also stipulated that all results were to be made public, regardless of outcome.

Nonetheless, local physicians were able to treat consecutively approximately 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease at the 34 Military Hospital in Freetown, the Port Loko Government Hospital, the Hastings Ebola Treatment Centre, and other sites in Sierra Leone. Patients were given atorvastatin (40 mg/day) and irbesartan (150 mg/day). Reports indicate that rapid clinical improvement was seen in almost all patients, and only two who were inadequately treated are known to have died (O.M.R., unpublished observations). One was critically ill when first seen and died soon thereafter. The other initially responded to 3 days of combination treatment, but when treatment was stopped and he was given an antiviral agent, he relapsed and died.",

Health care workers in West Africa should undertake pragmatic clinical trials to test combination treatment with statins and ARBs in Ebola patients and their contacts. The candidates who should be considered for treatment with statins and angiotensin receptor blockers are Ebola patients cared for in hospitals and other treatment units that are staffed by trained health care workers, Ebola patients treated at home, health care workers (to prevent severe illness in those who are at high risk and might become infected while caring for Ebola patients), family caregivers and other close contacts, and community surveillance and burial workers. The primary goal of treatment is to reduce patient mortality. Secondary goals are to reduce requirements for fluid and electrolyte replacement and prevent severe disease in health care workers and other contacts who become infected. Treating all patients consecutively would be the most straightforward approach, and results could be compared with those seen in historical controls. Clinical oncologists often use the same approach when they evaluate new treatments, and it can be highly efficient. For example, if the goal is to achieve a statistically significant (95% confidence interval) reduction in case fatality rates from 50% to 25%, only 52 patients would have to be treated. One problem with this method is uncertainty about mortality rates in historical controls in settings where better supportive care has already improved survival. This concern has already led to uncertainty about the results of the favipiravir study in Guinea (21) . If clinical record keeping in the centers in Sierra Leone where Ebola patients were treated had been adequate, a matched-set case-control study might be used to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of atorvastatin and irbesartan treatment.",

The combination of statins and ARBs might eventually be used to treat other filovirus infections. These agents might find a place in treating dengue hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus infections, and severe acute respiratory syndrome/Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections. Observational studies have already suggested that statins and ARBs may reduce mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (14) and that statins may reduce mortality in patients with influenza (24) . Combination treatment might be especially useful for a global response to an avian influenza pandemic. It might also find use in treating nonviral diseases, such as pneumococcal sepsis and severe malaria, and it might provide an effective medical countermeasure against potential agents of bioterrorism, such as those for smallpox, plague, and anthrax (24) .

As an alternative, inexpensive generic agents that counteract endothelial dysfunction could be used to treat Ebola patients.

All patients were treated with intravenous fluids and oral rehydration solution. The case fatality rate was 47.7% during the period from 20 September 2014 to 13 October 2014, but it declined to 23.4% during the period from 5 November 2014 to 7 December 2014. The authors could not explain this 51% decrease in mortality. Interestingly, reports from 34 Military Hospital and the Port Loko Government Hospital in November suggested that atorvastatin and irbesartan treatment was associated with improved survival, and some patients at the Hastings Center were also given the same treatment during November (O.M.R., unpublished observation). An-Opinion/Hypothesis sumana et al. did not acknowledge this in their report",
