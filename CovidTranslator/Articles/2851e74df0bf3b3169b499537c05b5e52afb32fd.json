Their relatively high rates of mutation and recombination frequencies allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches. Although Brazil has 18% of global avian species diversity, studies regarding the presence of avian viral diseases in wild birds in South America are scarce. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of the presence of CoVs in 746 wild birds. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs were obtained and placed together in vials containing VTM transport medium collected in different regions of Brazil between 2006 and 2013. Screening for viral nucleic acid was performed using conventional RT-PCR and pancoronavirus nested PCR. Positive samples were characterized by partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, and ensuing phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the association between virus epidemiology and bird migration routes. Coronavirus RNA were detected and sequenced from six samples, in which three were related to gammacoronaviruses group and the other three to deltacoronavirus group. Our study documents the presence of CoVs related to avian gamma-and deltacoronaviruses circulating in both urban-and poultry-farm regions of Brazil, implicating wild birds as potential carriers of CoVs which may represent a risk to poultry farms and public health in Brazil.",

This virus affects the gastrointestinal, respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems and may lead to mortality rates as high as 30% and sudden drops in egg production [7] . Moreover, many novel CoVs genetically distinct from IBV have been recently identified in different families of wild and domestic birds and mammals but their potential economic losses remain unknown. Recently, Dur\u00e3es-Carvalho et al.

This assay has been used for the identification and differentiation of CoV in the four genera d e s c r i b e d t o d a t e ( a l p h a -, b e t a -, g a m m a -, a n d deltacoronavirus) [17, 19, 20] . Similarly to our report, most of avian CoV diversity studies detected the same coronavirus genera [2, 17, 21, 22] , with the exception of a report of betacoronavirus detection in distinct birds species from a rehabilitation center in Brazil [8] . Further studies are needed to understand the circulation of betacoronavirus in birds. Ibirapuera is the main park in S\u00e3o Paulo, receiving on average 150,000 visitors in a single weekend. Wild birds make up a large portion of the species of animals that inhabit the park (ca. 142 species). The birds are kept free and cohabiting with the human population and other wild species (resident or visitors). There are another 21 species of wild animals, including bats and skunks, and the park also allows pets [23] . Such close contact between so many different species may cause interspecific transmission and recombination events, leading to the appearance of emerging viruses [24] . The three goose samples were collected from geese that live in this same environment in contact with wild birds that use the park as a stopping point. On the other hand, three migratory birds captured in wintering areas at Lagoa do Peixe National Park-RS have shown positive results of CoVs too. Sandpipers are boreal migrants that migrate south from North America in the winter [25] . A CoV related to deltacoronavirus group was obtained from a black skimmer (Rynchops niger), thus highlighting the possibility that migratory birds may be carrying these viruses across migratory routes in Brazil [9] . The Lagoa do Peixe region is an important migratory route [25] , and it is located close (400 miles) from one of the most important region of poultry farm production of Brazil, more specifically region of Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul State [26] .

Coronavirus RNA were detected in birds species of Anatidae family (Chinese goose) in Ibirapuera Park, S\u00e3o Paulo, southeast Brazil. Anatidae birds were already described as hosts of coronavirus all over the globe. However, interestingly, we report for the first time the detection in two sandpiper species (Calidris alba and Calidris fuscicollis) from Lagoa do Peixe National Park, a wintering area in southern Brazil. Although our data indicate a low prevalence of coronavirus in birds sampled, the genetic similarity between coronavirus detected at birds from distinct continents may indicate that wild birds are possibly carrying coronavirus throughout migratory routes as observed for avian influenza virus. We report the detection of samples related to delta-and gammacoronaviruses in different species of birds, some sampled in a park located inside the largest city in South America, indicating the circulation of coronavirus in urban areas (Table 3 ). In addition, all birds tested in this study were in apparently healthy populations. Further studies are required to determine the species and full genome similarity with other avian CoVs. However, our findings indicate that CoVs may be circulating among one of the major avian migratory routes in the world.",
