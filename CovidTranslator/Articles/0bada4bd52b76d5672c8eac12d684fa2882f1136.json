Despite this variable distribution of microorganisms, both aerosol and surface contamination may increase disease transmission risk. One costeffective decontamination tool used in hospitals as an adjunct to traditional cleaning and disinfection is ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation.

All samples were collected by a trained graduate student in a shared BR without a UVC device and in a shared BR with a permanently installed, wall-mounted automated UVC (254-nm) device (ASEPT.1X; Sanuvox, Saint-Laurent, QC, Canada). The decontamination cycle initiates only after there has been 30 seconds of no motion detected by infrared sensors, after which a UVC cycle will run for 5 minutes. The device is located directly above the door and has an automatic shutoff safety feature that terminates the cycle if the BR door is opened midrun. Both the UVC-treated BR and control BR contain a 6.0 L per flush, wash down toilet (TOTO, Morrow, GA) and have similar room volumes (12.7 and 11.7 m 3 , respectively). Air and surface samples were collected in each BR 5 minutes and 30 seconds after each patient use-a time that accounts for the decontamination cycle and permits comparison of the samples between each BR. A dual-headed SAS 360 bioaerosol sampler (Bioscience International, Rockville, MD) set to collect 150 L of air over 50 seconds was used to permit simultaneous collection of aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures. The anaerobic Brucella plates (Oxoid, Nepean, ON, Canada) were immediately placed in a candle jar postsampling and subsequently incubated anaerobically at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours prior to counting bacterial colonies. The aerobic 5% sheep blood agar plates (Oxoid) were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24-48 hours prior to counting.",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak at the Amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong Kong was caused by contamination of the sewage drainage system by the index patient. 3 The dry U-tube drains allowed virus containing-droplet nuclei to be pulled by air currents from the bathroom fan to neighboring apartments, with subsequent secondary severe acute respiratory syndrome cases. 1 On an international flight, a probable norovirus outbreak involved 8 crew members experiencing vomiting or diarrhea symptoms in the bathroom. 7 Although there was no obvious soiling of the bathroom, 5 passengers who visited it significantly more than the others developed norovirus-like symptoms. Shared BRs, specifically among patients in health care facilities, represent a significant challenge for controlling disease transmission. Frequent use by patients not only increases the microbial burden, but sequential flushing can actually cause release of organisms from a previous contamination; viral bioaerosols can be generated up to 7 flushes after initial contamination. 8 Patients entering the BR may be exposed to pathogens in the toilet plume originating from multiple previous patients, and because it is not practical to clean the BR after every patient use, these organisms may remain in the BR for some time. One limitation of this study was that consideration was not given to the nature of the patient's use of the washroom.",

To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the use of such a device in a shared BR. These results demonstrate the potential utility of permanently installed UVC lights to supplement decontamination efforts. Specifically, the short run time and automatic shutoff safety feature, in addition to its antimicrobial efficacy, make this device an ideal decontamination adjunct in shared BRs, where high microbial burden and frequent occupant use pose significant challenges to current manual cleaning and disinfection efforts. The potential to use this technology both in health care (bathrooms and procedure rooms) and in commercial applications (aircraft, train, and cruise ship bathrooms) is intriguing. ",
