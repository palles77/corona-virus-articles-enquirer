The interaction between porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Haemophilus parusuis has not been studied. We initiated studies to evaluate a possible effect of the PRRSv on the pathogenesis of polyserositis caused by H. parusuis. A group of 30 three week old piglets were distributed in 4 groups. Group I (10 pigs) was inoculated with PRRSv and H. parusuis. Group II (10 pigs) was inoculated with H. parusuis alone. Group III (5 pigs) was inoculated with virus alone and group IV (5 pigs) was inoculated with culture media. Lesions consisted of a severe fibrinous polyserositis affecting 7 of 10 animals in group II and a mild fibrinous pleuritis in 1 of IO animals of group I. Three of ten animals dually infected with the two agents died during the course of the study. These animals had pulmonary congestion and focal lung hemorrhages. No other animals died from other groups. Group III and IV had no macroscopic lesions. Microscopically group III had interstitial pneumonia. Immunomodulating virus effect may explain the differences in terms of lesions severity between groups I and II. Septic shock was suspected as cause of sudden death. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Stress conditions such as weaning or transport have been suggested as risk factors for the presentation of the disease (Menard and Moore, 1990 ). There has been a recent increase of fibrinous polyserositis outbreaks in the USA. possibly because of the high health status and immunological naive pigs produced using new technologies such as medicated early weaning (MEW) described by Wiseman et al., 1994 . Altematively, the increase in incidence may reflect widespread infection by PRRS virus. a putative immunosuppresive agent related to respiratory disease complex in swine (Done et al., 1992. Christianson and Joo. 1994) . PRRSv has been suggested to increase the severity of secondary bacterial outbreaks increasing mortality and poor doing animals in nurseries and growers , with a major economical impact in the last five years (Collins et al.. 1991a; Benfield et al., 1992; Kerkaert et al., 1994) .",

In contrast, a sharp enhancement of humoral and cell-mediated functions at the systemic level were also found.
