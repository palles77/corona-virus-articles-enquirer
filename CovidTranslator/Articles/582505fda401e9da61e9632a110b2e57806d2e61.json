            "text": "H ealthcare workers and residents in hospitals are at high risk of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) due to their close contact with MERS patients. In addition to the high physical strain of caring for patients potentially infected with MERS, healthcare workers face a tremendous mental burden in doing so, particularly given that the mortality rate of MERS is high, at 36% (namely, one out of 3 patients die). 1 The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that MERS, which is caused by a strain of corona virus (called MERS-CoV), is \"a threat to the entire world\". 2 The MERS is highly contagious through direct contact with infected patients. Globally, the WHO has reported 1,621 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, and there have been nearly 584 deaths related to MERS-CoV since September 2012. 3 The first case was reported in 2012 in Jeddah, the Kingdom of KSA, wherein the MERS-CoV was detected in the sputum of a patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure. 4 Apart from KSA, nearly 22 countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, have confirmed MERS cases. 3 The clinical presentation of MERS ranges from mild flu-like symptoms to severe acute respiratory illness and death; mortality is especially common among patients with comorbidities. Recent epidemiological research has highlighted a number of psychiatric morbidities associated with exposure to devastating epidemics of novel and highly lethal viruses. 5, 6 For medical professionals, the psychological effects of such exposure can jeopardize the medical care they provide. This highlights the need to review the Saudi health care system and policies related to infection control. In the present study, we describe medical residents' emotions, attitude, and perceptions related to an MERS outbreak. Several past studies have examined this for similar, equally threatening, outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 5,6 and influenza, 7 but never for an MERS outbreak. Understanding the fears, anxieties, and reactions of medical residents in close contact with MERS patients may help in devising better personal and family support for hospital employees, which will ultimately aid residents in facing the MERS crisis.",

Four tertiary hospitals in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) were included in this study: King Khalid University Hospital, King Fahad Medical City Hospital, King Abdulaziz Medical City Hospital, and King Faisal Specialist Hospital. We included all Saudi Board Internal Medicine residents who rotated into these hospitals between November 2015 and January 2016. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires, which were distributed and collected before resident education activities. The questionnaire contained a short description of the study aim and objectives. The study was conducted after obtaining ethical approval from the King Saud University Research Center (Research Project Number E-16-1873).",

The first part contained questions on participants' background information, including age, marital status, training level (ranging from R1 to R4), and knowledge of MERS (ranging from bad to good). The second part comprised 4 main sections that included an assessment of 1) work-related and 2) non-work related emotions, 3) the residents' attitude toward MERS, and (4 their knowledge of an MERS outbreak. Each question in these sections was measured using a 3-point Likert scale that ranged from \"disagree\" (1) to \"agree\" (3). We piloted the questionnaire in a group of 10 residents to assess its clarity.",

We examined the attitudes and emotions related to an MERS outbreak of the medical =0.10 P=0.126 MERS -Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, -Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, P -probability value residents serving as frontline physicians in 4 tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, KSA. Overall, our results indicated that most of medical residents believed their job put them at considerable risk of exposure and were afraid of contracting MERS; however, they also believed that it was part of their professional duty to care for MERS patients and accepted this risk of infection. Participants were also not willing to change their jobs due to the risk of exposure to MERS and they were confident that the hospitals would look after them if they were infected. These results generally accord with 2 recently published studies conducted in KSA among health care workers (HCWs), which sought to examine their attitudes and concerns regarding the emerging outbreak of MERS-CoV. In particular, in both studies, HCWs reported that their job put them at a high risk of contracting the infection. 9,10 For example, Abolfotouh et al 9 reported that around 70% of surveyed participants felt at risk of contracting a MERS-CoV infection at work, although around 61% felt obligated to provide medical care for patients infected with MERS-CoV. These findings are also consistent with studies conducted in other countries dealing with different viral outbreaks that had major emotional impacts on healthcare workers. [5] [6] [7] For instance, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, approximately two-thirds of healthcare workers in Toronto experienced concern for their own or their family's health. 6 In Hong Kong, 68% of participants reported a high level of stress and 57% were found to have experienced psychological distress; high stress was much more common among nurses and younger workers. 6 Unsurprisingly, most medical residents at the 4 centers recognized their professional obligation to look after patients with MERS despite the potential risk to themselves. This contrasts with the findings of a previous study in Australia during the avian influenza outbreak of 2006, wherein a hospital staff absentee rate of 38% was found. 11 Similar findings to the Australian study were reported in Hong Kong and Mainland China during the SARS outbreak, wherein a large number of HCWs were absent or refused to look after the infected patients. 6 By contrast, in Germany, only 28% of surveyed healthcare workers agreed that it would be professionally acceptable for healthcare workers to abandon their workplace during an influenza pandemic to protect themselves and their families, whereas 52% disagreed with this statement. 12 We found that older residents were more likely to report being afraid of infection than were younger residents. This is in contrast to Nickell et al 5 study, wherein 73% of staff who were younger than 30 years of age reported being concerned about infection, compared with only 65.6% of staff who were older than 50 years Tam et al 6 reported a similar finding to Nickell et al 5 younger staff members were more prone to job stress during a SARS outbreak than were older staff. However, in both Tam et al 6 and Nickle et al 5 studies, medical doctors were a minority of participants, making up only 9% and 3% of their cohort. In contrast, Wong et al 8 report no significant differences in distress among the age groups 8 In line with our study, Abolfotouh et al 9 reported that a greater percentage of HCWs who were older than 35 years of age reported a high level of concern about infection than did HCWs who were younger than 35 years (27% versus 23%) 12 Our finding may be attributed to the fact that we included only physicians. In addition, the cultural background of our sample might have influenced our findings: older physicians tend to have families and to be supporting their loved ones. Moreover, the median age of our sample differed from that of previous studies showing that younger staff had more concerns about infection than did older staff. In our study, around half of residents reported receiving adequate training in the use of personal protective equipment. In contrast, a study of HCWs affiliated with the Ministry of Health showed that most of participants lacked confidence in using protective equipment 10 The difference in findings might be attributed to the fact that our study was conducted at a tertiary hospital, which tend to have more opportunities for continuing medical education and hold more workshops. Moreover, the available level of expertise is often greater than that of primary or secondary hospitals. Another reason might be that we used medical residents as a sample, whereas most of participants in the other studies were nurses. The limitations of the present study include the cross-sectional research design and the possibility of reporting bias. Moreover, because the study was conducted in 4 tertiary hospitals in a single city, the results might not be generalizable to residents in other parts of the country. Although the MERS outbreak started in Jeddah, it has continued since its discovery in 2012 and spread to most of the hospitals in the country, including those involved in this study. Therefore, it is likely that all medical residents in these 4 hospitals had been exposed to or cared for suspected cases of MERS-CoV. Nevertheless, our study provides initial evidence for the attitudes, perceptions, and emotions related to an MERS outbreak among medical residents.",
