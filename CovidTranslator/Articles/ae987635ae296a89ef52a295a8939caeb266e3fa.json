Using Singapore as a case study, we explore how the state constructs the disease and implements measures targeted at creating a ring of defense around the island and using surveillance to monitor and prevent its spread. While there is support, there is also resentment among some Singaporeans who complain that their right to privacy has been invaded and that over surveillance may have actually occurred. Marginalisation and discrimination have not only affected the local population but in this open economy which is striving to achieve global city status, businesses, tourism, foreign talent, foreign contract workers and foreign students studying in Singapore have also been negatively affected. While Singapore has been applauded by WHO and used as an example of quick and effective response, a holistic approach to the management of infectious disease must address the social implications of strategies that are drawn from medical knowledge alone because it impinges on the social lives of people and how people interact with each other under stressful circumstances.",

            "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO), the watch dog in charge of curbing the spread of the disease and rallying countries together to find a fast and reliable test kit as well as a \"cure\", has benefited from the guidance provided by medical practitioners and epidemiologists whose concerns have been primarily biomedical. The focus has been on the possible sources of the virulent organism, the modes of transmission, symptoms presented and treatment [4, p. 39] . These clinical features and the pathology of the disease form the basis on which policies are formulated and tested to check their effectiveness in controlling the spread of SARS. We acknowledge the importance of this research agenda but suggest that the social dimensions of the SARS outbreak also need to be documented and understood. Many draconian policies were put in place arising from the medicalisation of SARS. Seeking medical solutions seem appropriate in a situation of imperfect knowledge. However, there are many implications such policies have on society, and more so if these societies are highly connected with the rest of the world. This paper has two objectives. First, we explore the implications of surveillance strategies used during the SARS outbreak on a city with globalising aspirations. While open borders and strong interlinkages have been heralded for creating economic growth and enriching societies through intercultural exchanges, SARS has resurfaced the dangers of overexposure and rekindled fears of security breaches. We show which specific groups of people are deemed as external threats to the nationstate and examine the emergent public discourse on the costs of keeping borders open. Second, we investigate state and non-state, spatial and non-spatial strategies which have emerged to contain the disease. We will unpack, within a specific context, the broad public discourse on the contagion effects of SARS and the need to wage a \"war\" against the \"epidemic\". Framing the disease within such rhetoric increases public consciousness and elicits co-operation. We examine public perceptions of surveillance and policing as a means to understanding the implications containment has as a strategy for future plans of action in case of re-emergence. We will also explore how members of society construct \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" zones as social reactions to contagious outbreaks.",

            "text": "Kearns and Moon [5] , in their analysis of medical geography over a decade, pointed out that diffusion studies of disease tend to adopt a geometric, acontextual perspective of space. While scientifically rigorous, such studies tend to ignore the interaction of social, economic, cultural, institutional and historical contingencies of place which are crucial for understanding disease, health and health care. While not denying the value of positivist research to understanding the geography of disease, Parr [6] argues that such studies must be approached more critically in order to understand the social lineaments and construction of disease. Thus, this study attempts to work through and understand SARS from a social perspective within the primary context of Singapore, taking into account the idea that specific locality issues are important to understanding outcomes [7] . Why was the island so successful [8, 9] in its containment policies, disruptive as these were to economic and social institutions and to daily life? By examining the social responses to these measures, we hope to \"relocate\" public health research away from a purely medical focus. As Foucault [cited in 10, p. 112] argued, illness may be biologically determined but insofar as it is observed and treated by others than self, current research must enter the realm of politics, of discrimination and of civil rights [11, 12] .",

            "text": "Medical knowledge on SARS was very limited when it began its insidious spread in Singapore in early 2003. The disease was called \"atypical pneumonia\" and was later identified as a member of the coronavirus family \"never before seen in humans\" [WHO cited in 13, p. 1]. Classification was employed to separate the probable from suspected cases using temperature and other symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath/breathing problems, lab test results and X-rays. The index casepatient, Patient A, was admitted into Tan Tock Seng Hospital on 1 March 2003 for atypical pneumonia after returning from a trip to Hong Kong. While two others who accompanied this patient on the trip recovered, 24 of Patient A's primary contacts were infected. These included eight nurses, one health attendant, five patients in the same ward and 10 visitors. The first person to die, on 25 March 2003, was the father of Patient A. The second was the pastor of Patient A, a day later. SARS started off as a primarily nosocomial (hospitalacquired) infection. According to Gopalakrishna et al. [14] , the early stages were the most detrimental because lack of knowledge prevented quick action to isolate and contain, leading to the spread of SARS into the community. Individuals who were infected during their visits to hospitalised friends and relatives spread the disease to another epicentre, Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market, which was closed for 15 days. Table 1 shows the profile of those infected. In total, there were 238 cases and a fatality rate of 13.9% [15, 16] . By 30 May 2003, WHO had removed Singapore from the list of countries The high fatality rate and the rapid spread caused concern and action was taken to put a ring around the infection. To elicit the co-operation of the public, Singaporeans were warned about the methods of transmission, e.g., close contact (droplets), and there was even mention of the length of time the virus can stay alive on any surface [17] . The incubation period was defined as 10 days before the onset of symptoms and Singapore-ans were informed how the initial index case was imported from Hong Kong and the subsequent spread of SARS was traced over time and space, both locally and on a global basis. A slew of information on infection control measures such as the use of the N-95 mask, gloves, shoe and head covers, goggles, gowns, hand washing, change of clothing, disinfection of facilities and isolation rooms and hospitals provided the public with a basic understanding of how to assess the risk of spread and the need to contain the disease [4, 13] .",

Common areas were disinfected more frequently, e.g., elevators, public toilets and hawker centres. Schools, kindergartens and child-care centres were especially vigilant in an effort to protect the children. In fact, at the very beginning of the outbreak, schools were closed for 2 weeks until the state could develop better means of control and monitoring. An education programme was started on television (there was even a special SARS channel set up) advising Singaporeans to wash their hands frequently, to cover their nose and mouth with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, not to spit and to take their temperature twice a day. They were also advised to eat properly in order to build up body immunity. Details were also provided with regard to what to do if one suspects oneself/family members to be infected.

Foreign workers who came to Singapore to work as construction workers, including those from the Peoples' Republic of China (PRC), were subject to a 14-day quarantine at a more isolated location on the island. Foreign professionals working in Singapore as well as Singaporeans who had visited SARS-affected countries were asked to voluntarily quarantine themselves for 10 days. Students were likewise asked to do so and to declare their overseas visits to the school. Although not mandatory, some offices and public institutions also employed this method of surveillance.

Should the names of those who were served such orders be made public? Would public naming infringe the privacy and rights of individuals? Do hospitals have a right to prevent Singaporeans from seeing their loved ones who are ill and need their moral support? Evidently, Singaporeans sensed unequal distributions of power [19] . Health, being basic to human endeavour, may be regarded as a foundational justification for government action. However, not everyone accepts the diminution of individual autonomy and privacy in exchange for collective benefits [20] . Certainly there will be degrees of acceptance in such social contracts, even if they pertain to the \"new global threat\" [21] . These form the grist for understanding the disease from a social point of view of which the next sections outline three broad areas of discussion: how security becomes redefined as global movements of people threaten to spread infectious diseases; social responsibility in maintaining surveillance and control for good public health; and fear in shaping perceptions of safe and unsafe places when infectious diseases threaten.",

            "text": "In conventional security terms, since statehood is tied to territory, movements of population can undermine security as people have long been known to be responsible for the transmission of disease. Infectious diseases were often named after their areas of origin, e.g., the \"Spanish pox\" and expulsion and quarantine used as measures to control spread [22] . For instance, the Immigration Law of 1891 in the US made it mandatory for all immigrants entering the country to be given a health inspection by public health service doctors at Ellis Island, New York, or other ports of entry. Infectious diseases like typhoid, tuberculosis, smallpox and trachoma raised the spectre of eugenics in US immigration policy [23] . As the flows of people increase in contemporary times, the rhetoric used in conventional discourse on security is now employed for disease, e.g., we talk about the \"fight against disease\" or use the term \"a time bomb\" [Thomson, 1997 cited in 22, p. 226]. Globalisation has encouraged business and tourist travel as well as legal and illegal migration. With the freer movement of people, the unconscious spread of disease has serious consequences for any nation. On the one hand, multinational organisations such as WHO put up and enforce protective policies but at the same time, national governments can undo these efforts by actively promoting business and tourism travel and overseas studentships. For nations that are well plugged into the global economy, such movements can only grow in the foreseeable future. Will the potential threats to health and security be put aside for more immediate benefits?",

Agreeing, Ow [25] says that Singaporeans have a perennial \"crisis mentality\". They are constantly reminded by the government that Singapore's position in the global economy is a very vulnerable one. Singaporeans need to work hard to sustain its economic and social growth. This mindset has helped to direct Singaporeans' energies in the same direction so that the country can grow economically. In 2003, Singapore recorded a GDP of SGD38,023 per capita compared to SGD1567 per capita in 1965 when the country first became independent [26] . Much of the growth has been attributed to the purposeful global engagement of the island's economy. While foreign direct investments (FDI) into the country was SGD217 billion at the end of 2001, Singapore also invested SGD131 billion abroad [27] . As a business epicentre, Singaporeans have to act responsibly so that investors, entrepreneurs and business executives will still continue to come. At all costs, investment confidence in the island should not be diminished by the SARS outbreak [28] .",

Formal processes emanating from the state take a back stage while self-regulatory civil and individual mechanisms come forward in the governance of public health. Using knowledge and raising issues related to risk and responsibility, individuals and communities can be moved to act independently or as a group to manage and reduce harm [33] . Unlike the obvious actions of governments, self-regulation amongst \"responsibilised\" subjects [33, p. 188 ] assumes ideological significance because this new interpretation of regulation is more progressive, involving voluntary action and not just state legislation alone. Private, civil and commercial institutions and agencies form the non-state segment for action. However, in a country where state influence is as strong as it is in Singapore, how much confidence does the leadership place on self-regulation?

PRC hit back by banning tour groups to Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. At the height of SARS, many companies in Singapore imposed an informal non-essential travel ban on its management and technical staff. This measure is consistent with travel advisories about SARS-affected locations such as PRC, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Toronto. In our survey, 80% of the respondents were willing to stop travel to SARS-affected countries for business or leisure.",

The term \"super-spreader\" was used in the Singapore context on index cases. Index case Patient A who eventually recovered had her encounter with the disease featured on television [48] . Her name was identified in the newspapers, generating a great deal of debate. Her \"wrongdoing\" was to bring SARS into Singapore and to have caused the death of loved ones. The psychological trauma she went through was also recounted in the programme but the damage was already evident. She had caused harm and she felt marginalised by Singapore society. She was not the only one to feel ostracised. A physician whose clinic was listed by MOH as one of the places two SARS patients had visited, talked about feeling victimised: \"When I go out, people point at me and give me funny looks\" because they wondered why she had not sent her patients immediately to Tan Tock Seng Hospital [49] . The local newspapers also reported that healthcare workers, nurses in particular, were avoided by Singaporeans [50, 51] when they boarded public transportation, e.g., the Mass Rapid Transit System. They could be easily identified as they wore nurses' uniforms. Some hospitals attempted to overcome this problem by making the nurses change into street attire before they left the hospital. Indeed how the body is represented and read has significant bearing on surveillance and the use of space in the context of SARS. Lim [52] also showed that Singaporeans feared discrimination and were ambivalent about naming quarantined individuals to non-family members. As surmised by a newspaper correspondent, \"SARS is SARS, single syllabled and sibilant. The name hisses with the clarity of a deadly snake\" [53, p. 16] .",

The \"war\" rhetoric used on SARS echoed a similar approach to galvanise Singaporeans to work towards a common goal during this period of \"crisis\". No less than 10 cabinet and junior ministers gathered together to meet 1800 grassroots, business and youth leaders in mid-2003. The leaders called upon Singaporeans to \"do [their] part\" [55] . According to then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, \"there is no excuse for anyone in Singapore not to know the part he has to play . . . All of us as ordinary citizens . . . have a part to fight SARS\" [55, p. 1] . Putting people and government at the same level renders the disease a \"national challenge\" as the state is \"half the shop\" and people the other half (then-Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong cited in [55, p. 1] ). It therefore came as no surprise that we found as high as 93% of the total sample in the survey was willing to self-quarantine if the need arose.

High-risk locations like polyclinics, private clinics, the airport and buildings in close spatial proximity to possible \"epicentres\" were also mapped onto respondents' avoidance zones. One-quarter of the respondents (24.9%) said they avoided travel by taxi. This arose because a taxi driver was infected by a SARS patient he had unsuspectingly ferried. This taxi driver eventually died but it was only in the autopsy that the connection was made. As a consequence, taxi companies in Singapore had to disinfect their taxis twice a day and the drivers were asked to open their windows instead of turn on the air-conditioning in their vehicles. Taxi drivers took their temperatures twice a Others Meeting friends and relatives 8.0",

Until more knowledge could be gathered, WHO recommended conservative actions in order to be on the safe side. Singapore's vulnerability as an open economy and society, in the minds of the leaders, left them no choice but to take this approach. Draconian measures described above were implemented with little hesitation as to their social implications. From travel bans to outright penalties against foreigners working or studying in Singapore, SARS erected physical as well as mental borders against the globalising aspirations of this city-state. In addition, the high level of public consciousness raised to secure co-operation led to general agreement and support for the many initiatives taken by the state, as well endorsement of the speed with which the problem was tackled. Singaporeans put up with the spatial barriers erected and voluntarily avoided high-risk places as these were conceived as potentially dangerous spaces. Nonetheless, the politics of containment revealed that discrimination, exclusion and protection of privacy remain social issues of some contention. As much as Singaporeans worried about the SARS threat, they also expressed discontent with intrusions into their privacy.",

However, the old priority of cost efficiency is being reviewed because many infections had been passed in eight-bedder wards [57] .",

Singapore's specific local context in terms of its historical experience may not be suitable for other countries. Taiwan also implemented the ring fence concept by putting a quarantine order on a hospital but nurses and doctors were unhappy with their confinement and 25 staff fled [58] . Similarly PRC reported instances of rioting against the setting up of quarantine centres in two provinces [59] . The politics of containment must examine receptivity to legislative decisions in the light of the historic and cultural specificity of the location. Transparency is something of a recent phenomenon in PRC politics [60] . The sluggish response of Hong Kong was blamed on the desire to maintain business as usual in this international hub [61] . In the case of Taiwan, Ho [62] attributes excessive politicisation, e.g., laying blame on PRC and on opposition as the main problem for ineffective management of the disease. While most would subscribe to greater transparency and better co-ordination between government bodies at a national level as well as with WHO and CDC (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention), ultimately the response to infectious diseases will depend on social values, social conditions and political contingencies. In the case of Singapore, we have objectively shown that there was fairly widespread support for measures other countries were unwilling to adopt. The SARS episode revealed that compliance is effective and necessary for the containment of infectious diseases. The limited amount of questioning, the rapid rate of adoption and the smooth carry through of many of the policies came down to two things in Singapore: strong social discipline and the crisis mentality of the people. Whether these are replicable elsewhere is another paper but certainly this unique situation has helped Singapore come out of the crisis.",
