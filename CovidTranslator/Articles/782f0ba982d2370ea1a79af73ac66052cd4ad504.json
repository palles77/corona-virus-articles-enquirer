Here, four yeast \u00c01 RF signals are shown to promote significant mRNA destabilization through the nonsense mediated mRNA decay pathway (NMD), and genetic evidence is presented suggesting that they may also operate through the no-go decay pathway (NGD) as well. Yeast EST2 mRNA is highly unstable and contains up to five \u00c01 RF signals. Ablation of the \u00c01 RF signals or of NMD stabilizes this mRNA, and changes in \u00c01 RF efficiency have opposing effects on the steady-state abundance of the EST2 mRNA. These results demonstrate that endogenous \u00c01 RF signals function as mRNA destabilizing elements through at least two molecular pathways in yeast. Consistent with current evolutionary theory, phylogenetic analyses suggest that \u00c01 RF signals are rapidly evolving cis-acting regulatory elements. Identification of high confidence \u00c01 RF signals in $10% of genes in all eukaryotic genomes surveyed suggests that \u00c01 RF is a broadly used post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression.",

            "text": "While 'outcome-neutral' approaches using mRNA motifs known to promote efficient PRF cannot identify new classes of frameshift signals, they enable an expansion of our understanding of operational uses for PRF. The seminal study in this field searched the yeast genome for operational \u00c01 ribosomal frameshift (\u00c01 RF) promoting motifs resembling well characterized examples of viral \u00c01 RF signals, identifying $260 putative such elements (9) . This work was limited by incomplete annotation of the yeast genome and insufficient computational resources available at the time. New bioinformatics tools were subsequently developed and applied using faster and more robust computational platforms. The results showed that: pattern matching approaches coupled with a predictive method for folding RNA sequences provided a dramatic improvement in the results; \u00c01 RF motifs are widespread in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and many have predicted secondary structures with statistically significant measures of free energy (15) . This analysis showed that $11% of yeast genes contain at least one high probability \u00c01 RF signal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that nine putative \u00c01 RF signals selected from a variety of S. cerevisiae genes/genome promoted efficient recoding in vivo. More recently, this bioinformatics protocol has been applied to additional genomes. Currently, more than 25 genomes have been analyzed and it appears that 8-12% of genes contain at least one potential \u00c01 RF signal (see PRFdB at http://prfdb.umd.edu/) (17) .",

            "text": "A key finding was that the outcome and function of \u00c01 RF differs significantly between the viral and 'cellular' contexts. In viruses, PRF controls the stoichiometries of structural versus enzymatic proteins (18) . In contrast, 'cellular' RF events redirect elongating ribosomes to premature termination codons, suggesting that \u00c01 RF is used to control cellular mRNA abundance and stability through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. While PRF is required for the production of functional products, in the cellular context RF appears to operate in a different manner. Thus, in the current work, PRF is used to connote frameshift signals whose function is to produce C-terminally extended proteins with novel functions, while RF is used to refer to frameshift signals that operate to direct ribosomes to premature termination codons. A proof-of-principle experiment demonstrated that a viral \u00c01 PRF signal can function as an mRNA destabilizing element and that mRNA destabilization required NMD (19) . Here, rapid degradation of a reporter mRNA through NMD is demonstrated for four cellular yeast \u00c01 RF signals. Further, genetic evidence suggests that the presence of the RF-stimulating pseudoknot may promote mRNA destabilization through the no-go decay (NGD) pathway (20) . The EST2 gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase (21) , was used to delve deeper into the relationships between \u00c01 RF and mRNA stability. The EST2 mRNA is destabilized by \u00c01 RF primarily via NMD. Ablation of its five \u00c01 RF signals resulted in stabilization of the EST2 mRNA, and an inverse correlation between \u00c01 RF efficiency and EST2 mRNA steady-steady state abundance was observed.",

The zero-frame dual-luciferase reporter plasmid (pJD375) along with the -1 RF signal containing dsDNA fragments were digested using these restriction enzymes and ligated together to generate endogenous -1 RF signal containing dual-luciferase vectors. Oligonucleotide primers were chosen to terminate in KpnI restriction sites and amplify 41 and 30 bases of Renilla and firefly luciferase derived sequences respectively. The resulting amplicons were cloned into the KpnI site 492 bases into the PGK1 open reading frame of the unmodified PGK1 containing vector (pJD741).

The steady-state abundance of the SPR6 \u00c01 RF signal containing reporter mRNA was primarily increased in dom34D cells ($2.0-fold). Deletion of DCP1, XRN1 and SKI3, all of which function downstream of UPF1 or DOM34, also generally increased the abundance of the reporter mRNAs ( Figure 2D -F). We note however that, in the case of the dcp1D cells, the reporter mRNAs were relatively abundant, most likely because of the presence of the 3 0 ! 5 0 exonuclease activity of the exosome, and/or due to decapping activity contributed by other factors, e.g. by the presence of the L-A virus (29) . These results establish that endogenous cellular \u00c01 RF signals can decrease mRNA steady-state abundance in yeast through the NMD pathway. In addition, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that a subset of these signals may also affect mRNA abundance through NGD, although substantiation of this claim requires further studies, e.g. to monitor the abundance of the endonucleolytic cleavage products and mRNA stability assays in NGD \u00c0 strains.",

To confirm this, a series of time course mRNA decay assays were performed employing the PGK1-EST2 \u00c01 RF reporter, the readthrough control, and the PTC containing construct in cells harboring the temperature sensitive rpb1-1 allele of RNA polymerase II. At the zero time point, cells were shifted to the non-permissive temperature (42 C) to arrest transcription of mRNAs, total cellular mRNAs were extracted at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 min. subsequent to the temperature shift, and RNA blots were hybridized with the firefly luciferase and U3 snoRNA probes. While the readthrough control was stable in wild-type cells ( Figure 3A and D) , both the PTC containing control and the reporter containing the EST2 \u00c01 RF signal promoted rapid exponential decay of the reporter mRNA, thus demonstrating that this \u00c01 RF signal can operate as an mRNA destabilizing element ( Figure 3B-D) . In a parallel experiment using rpb1-1 upf1D cells, all of the reporter mRNAs remained stable ( Figure 3E-H) . The rapid decay kinetic profile of the EST2 \u00c01 RF containing reporter, and its stabilization in NMD-deficient cells are consistent with NMD being the major decay pathway triggered by this element (19) . To independently test of this, the A AAA AAT slippery site was partially inactivated by mutating it to G AAG AAC. This silent mutation stabilized the reporter mRNA $19-fold compared to the wild-type slippery site in wild-type, i.e. DOM34 cells ( Figure 3I ). Interestingly, this is less than the 35-fold stabilization in upf1D cells. One would expect that, since NMD is dependent of \u00c01 RF, then inactivation of \u00c01 RF should be quantitatively the same as inactivation of NMD. To address this, the steady state abundance of the G AAG AAC slippery site containing PGK1 reporter was assayed in an isogenic dom34D strain ( Figure 3I, dom34D lane) . This combination increased the steady-state abundance of the reporter mRNA to near wild-type levels.",

            "text": "The EST family of yeast genes is named after their 'Ever Shortening Telomere' phenotype (30) . EST2 encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase and the other three EST genes either encode protein subunits of telomerase (EST1 and EST3) or a telomere-associated regulator of telomerase (CDC13/EST4) (31) . Telomere elongation occurs in late S phase, although Est2p is associated to varying extents with telomeric chromatin throughout the cell cycle, and telomerase defects result in chromosome instability and rapid senescence (32) . The very low abundance EST2 mRNA is stabilized in NMD-deficient cells (33, 34) . Computational analyses revealed that EST2 contains four additional high confidence \u00c01 RF signals beginning at positions 72, 1215, 1326 and 1995 (Supplementary Figure S1 ). The positions of the five predicted \u00c01 RF signals in the EST2 ORF are shown in Figure 4A . Silent protein coding changes were introduced into the slippery sites of all 5 of the \u00c01 RF signals in a full-length EST2 clone expressed from a low copy vector (pEST2ss\u00c1, Figure 4A ). Clones expressing either wild-type EST2 (pEST2) or pEST2ss\u00c1 were introduced into isogenic est2D or est2D upf1D cells, and qRT-PCR analyses were performed. These silent mutations resulted $8.5-fold increase in the abundance of the full-length EST2ss\u00c1 mRNA relative to wild-type EST2 mRNA ( Figure 4B) . Similarly, abrogation of NMD increased the abundance of the wild-type EST2 and EST2ss\u00c1 mRNAs $5.8-fold and $7.0-fold, respectively. To independently monitor the influence of \u00c01 RF on mRNA abundance, the steady-state abundance of the EST2 mRNA was monitored in isogenic cells expressing up-and down-frameshift promoting alleles of RPL3 (which encodes ribosomal protein L3) by qRT PCR. EST2 mRNA abundances were normalized to U3 snoRNA in cells expressing wild-type RPL3, the rpl3-R247A allele which decreases \u00c01 RF from the L-A frameshift signal to $55% of wild-type levels (35) , and the rpl3-W255C/P247S allele which increases \u00c01 RF by $1.6-fold (36) . Relative to wild-type cells, steady-state abundance of the EST2 mRNA was increased by 1.29 \u00b1 0.04 fold in cells expressing rpl3-R247A, and decreased to 0.55 \u00b1 0.02 in cells expressing rpl3-W255C/P247S ( Figure 4C ). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that \u00c01 RF induced NMD plays a significant role in destabilizing EST2 mRNA.",

To address this, the BUB3, EST2, SPR6 and TBF1 orthologs were identified in S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. bayanus, S. castellii, S. kudriavzevii and S. kluyveri, and analyzed for potentially significant \u00c01 RF signals as previously described (15) . At first glance, Positions of the slippery sites of five predicted \u00c01 RF signals and their sequences are indicated. The full-length gene including native 5 0 and 3 0 UTR sequences were cloned into a low-copy yeast vector to create pEST2. Silent coding mutations that are predicted to inactivate \u00c01 RF were introduced to produce pEST2ss\u00c1. (B) pEST2 or pEST2ss\u00c1 were introduced into est2D or est2D upf1D cells and EST2 mRNA steady state abundances were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. (C) Quantitative real-time PCR was used to monitor steady-state abundance of the endogenous EST2 mRNA in isogenic cells expressing three different forms of ribosomal protein L3: Wild-Type RPL3 (WT); the R247A mutant which promotes decreased rates of \u00c01 RF and the W255C/P257S mutant which promotes increased \u00c01 RF efficiency. EST2 mRNA abundances were normalized to U3 snoRNA abundance for each sample, and the values shown are relative to wild-type cells.",

However, closer analysis shows that strong candidate \u00c01 RF signals can be identified in the orthologs of all of these genes, although not in every species. For example, as noted above, the S. cerevisiae EST2 mRNA contains five potential \u00c01 RF signals. Similarly, the S. paradoxus ortholog contains five potential \u00c01 RF signals, although none are identical to the S. cerevisiae elements. S. mikatae EST2 appears to harbor two potential \u00c01 RF signals, S. bayanus has three, and S. castelli contains two, and S. kluyveri has three. None were identified in the S. kudriavzevii EST2 ortholog. Turning to SPR6, the S. cerevisiae mRNA contains a second potential \u00c01 RF signal beginning at nucleotide 348 in addition to that identified beginning at nucleotide 279 (see http://cbmgintra.umd.edu/prfdb/index .cgi/detail?id=1755&accession=SGDID:S0000917& slipstart=348). Both the S. paradoxus and S. kudriavzevii SPR6 orthologs contain three potential \u00c01 RF signals, but none were identified in the S. mikatae S. bayanus or S. castelli orthologs. Interestingly, the S. kluyveri SPR6 ortholog contains a slippery site followed by a strong stem-loop structure; while this may or may not constitute a \u00c01 RF signal, it does suggest the presence of a rapidly evolving cis-acting element (see Discussion below). S. cerevisiae BUB3 contains the operational \u00c01 RF signal at nucleotide 858, plus potential \u00c01 RF signals beginning at nucleotides 27 and 732. The orthologous mRNAs in S. paradoxus, S. bayanus, S. castelli and S. kudriavzevii each appear to have one potential \u00c01 RF signal, but none were identified in S. mikatae or S. kluyveri. Lastly, the S. cerevisiae TBF1 mRNA has only the single confirmed \u00c01 RF signal. The S. castelli, S. kudriavzevii and S. kluyveri orthologs contain two each, and the S. mikatae has one. No potential \u00c01 RF signals were identified in either S. paradoxus or S. bayanus. As a control, six S. cerevisiae genes lacking predicted \u00c01 RF signals were selected (PGK1, HHT1, TEF2, MIC14, CMD1 and GRX1), orthologs from the six other yeast species identified, and these were in turn queried for the presence of putative \u00c01 RF signals. These analyses revealed that none of the orthologs of these six genes contain predicted \u00c01 RF signals (Supplementary Table S5 , and hyperlinked data therein). The potential evolutionary significance these observations are discussed below.",

Subsequently, a bioinformatics approach was used to determine that potential \u00c01 RF signals are widely found in all genomes examined, and that the great majority of these are predicted to direct elongating ribosomes to premature termination codons (15, 17) . Here, we show that these chromosomally encoded, endogenous \u00c01 RF signals can also function as cis-acting mRNA destabilizing elements, both in the context of a reporter mRNA, and also in one case in a natural context. Further, we demonstrated that \u00c01 RF signals can differentially affect mRNA abundance through the NMD pathway, and the data are also consistent with destabilization through NGD. These are modeled in Figure 5 . In support of this idea, the EST2, BUB3 and SPR6 mRNAs were all stabilized in upf1D, upd2D/nmd2D, upf3D, dcp1D and xrn1D cells (37) , and the half-lives of these mRNAs were less than the mean in wild-type cells (38) . Interestingly, TBF1 is not represented in these databases. In the case of a ribosome shifting reading frame into a PTC, the surveillance complex led by the Upf proteins signals rapid decapping by Dcp1p/Dcp2p, followed by deadenylation and exonucleolytic decay via Xrn1p and the exosome. In parallel, the NGD pathway can be activated by ribosomes that are stalled at strong secondary structures in mRNAs. Stalled ribosomes are freed from mRNAs by Dom34p/Hbs1p, promoting exonucleolytic cleavage at unpaired nucleotides near the pause, thus resulting in two mRNA fragments which become substrates for decapping and exonucleolytic decay [reviewed in (39) ]. The findings presented here suggest that cells are not only well equipped to deal with aberrant messages which contain premature termination codons and to clear stalled ribosomes from mRNAs, but have also evolved to capitalize upon these functions to post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression.",

It is important to note however that the software used to predict mRNA pseudoknots can neither identify base triples, which make major contributions to frameshifting (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) , let alone calculate their contributions to thermodynamic stability. Regardless, this combination of high frameshifting and thermodynamic stability results in very strong destabilization via NMD ( Figure 2B ), and perhaps NGD as well ( Figure 2C ). As discussed previously (19) , the exponential decay profile suggests that NMD can occur beyond the 'pioneer round' of translation.",

            "text": "In contrast to EST2, the TBF1 signal promoted $5% frameshifting (15), but is not predicted to be highly stable (\u00c09.5 kcal/mol). Thus, all of its mRNA destabilization activity was through NMD (compare Figure 2B with C). The thermodynamic stability of the BUB3 signal is predicted to have an intermediate value to EST2 and TBF1 ($\u00c012 kcal/mol), and hence the potential contribution of NGD to the stability of its reporter was significant. Interestingly, this signal only promoted $1% frameshifting (15) , yet the contribution of NMD to its destabilization was greater than observed for TBF1. One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy may stem from the fact that, in order to measure frameshifting, one base had to be deleted from the spacer region between the slippery site and the stimulatory pseudoknot. Changes in the length and composition of this spacer are known to affect rates of \u00c01 PRF (45) , and thus the \u00c01 RF values so determined cannot be taken as absolute. In contrast, the reporters used to monitor mRNA stability contained the native sequences. In light of this, it is likely that the native BUB3 \u00c01 RF signal promotes more frameshifting than the TBF1 signal. Lastly, the SPR6 \u00c01 RF signal is predicted to be quite stable ($\u00c020 kcal/mol), yet promoted very low levels of frameshifting ($0.5%) (15) . Accordingly, destabilization via NMD was negligible for this element, while NGD appeared to be the major contributor.",

            "text": "Beyond the pro forma demonstration that \u00c01 RF signals can decrease cellular mRNA abundance, it is important to begin to understand the biological function of this phenomenon. As a first step in this direction, we showed that silently mutating the slippery sites in 5 predicted \u00c01 RF signals within a full-length clone of EST2 significantly stabilized its encoded mRNA ( Figure 5B) . Similarly, abrogation of NMD stabilized this message, while changes in \u00c01 RF efficiency inversely correlated with EST2 steady-state mRNA abundance. Est2p is the reverse transcriptase subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme (21) . Interestingly, prior studies have demonstrated that this mRNA, along with other mRNAs encoding proteins having telomere-associated functions, are stabilized in NMD \u00c0 yeast cells (33, 37) . Analysis of the Programmed Ribosomal Frameshift Database (http:// prfdb.umd.edu/) reveals that, along with the other four putative \u00c01 RF signals in the EST2 mRNA, the mRNAs encoding Est1p, Stn1p, Cdc13p and Orc5p, all components or regulators of telomerase that are stabilized in NMD \u00c0 cells, also contain high confidence \u00c01 RF signals (Supplementary Figure S2 ). In addition, the EST3 mRNA contains a +1 PRF signal (46) . Intriguingly, telomerase is limiting in cells: while a yeast cell contains 64 chromosome ends, there are only $29 telomerase molecules per cell, and telomerase is preferentially recruited to short telomeres (47) . Additionally, Tbf1p is a telobox containing general regulatory factor that binds to TTAGGG repeats within subtelomeric anti-silencing regions (48) . Intriguingly, ablation of NMD (49) or overexpression of single components of telomerase-associated proteins, i.e. the TEL1 RNA, Est2p, Stn1p or Cdc13p resulted in changes in telomere length (47, 50, 51) .",

            "text": "We hypothesize that yeast cells use \u00c01 RF to limit the expression of these proteins in order to maintain the correct stoichiometric balance among telomere associated components. Corollary to this, mutations that alter \u00c01 RF and/or NMD should affect telomere function, and should thus show phenotypic defects similar to those observed in telomerase mutants, e.g. cell cycle progression defects. Indeed, we have isolated numerous such mutants [reviewed in (52) ], and have reported that the mof2-1 and mof5-1 mutants, which affect both NMD and \u00c01 RF tend to accumulate large mother-daughter cells, and/or multiply budded cells, typical of G2/M cell cycle defects (53) . Similarly, upf1D cells have abnormally elongated buds, and decreased telomere lengths (54, 55) . Intriguingly, mof6-1 mutants, which only affect \u00c01 RF, arrest as large, unbudded cells, typical of M-phase exit defects (53) . These observations suggest that stabilization of the mRNAs encoding multiple telomere-associated proteins may have dominant negative effects on telomere homeostasis, and that NMD and \u00c01 RF may regulate different aspects of the cell cycle. Additionally, the central role of Bub3p at the mitotic cell cycle spindle assembly checkpoint and the progeroid phenotypes caused by Bub3p deficiency (56) suggest a more general role for \u00c01 RF in control of cell growth and division. Lastly, the expression of Spr6p during sporulation (57) suggests a role for \u00c01 RF in this developmental process as well. Future studies will dissect the roles of the \u00c01 RF signals in these mRNAs.",

The major problem associated with attempting a phylogenetic analysis of \u00c01 RF signals is the inherent limitations of the software used to predict them. In short, it is not well enough developed to automatically identify matching motifs. In an attempt to begin to address this issue, the orthologous Bub3p, Est2p, Spr6p and Tbf1p's in six closely related yeast species were identified, their nucleotide sequences extracted from the Yeast Gene Order Browser (28) , and analyzed for the presence of potential \u00c01 RF signals. These analyses revealed that while specific \u00c01 RF signals do not appear to be evolutionarily conserved, \u00c01 RF itself may be relatively well-enough conserved as a mechanism to post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of these genes across many but not all species examined (see Supplementary Table S4 ). Importantly, the control experiment showed that putative \u00c01 RF signals were not detected in any of the orthologs of six S. cerevisiae genes that themselves were not predicted to contain \u00c01 RF signals. These observations are in agreement with current evolutionary theory based on analyses of 5 0 UTR sequences of Drosophila species proposing that rapid rates of mutation in cis-acting regulatory elements drives speciation because they confer very specific effects on gene expression, as opposed to mutations affecting protein structure, the pleiotrophic effects of which impose very high penalties on fitness (58) (59) (60) . The findings presented in this work, i.e. that while \u00c01 RF signals are not conserved in orthologs from other yeasts, these ORFs contain generically contain \u00c01 RF signals, and that the absence of \u00c01 RF signals in other orthologous ORFs, agrees very well with this theory of molecular evolution.",

The \u00c01 RF signals from SPR6, EST2, BUB3 and TBF1 were cloned into a PGK1 reporter minigene such that frameshift events would cause elongating ribosomes to encounter premature termination codons (PTC). Readthrough (RT) and in-frame PTC containing reporters are included as controls. Northern blots of total mRNAs extracted from logarithmically growing cells were probed with a reporter-specific oligonucleotide (PGK), stripped and re-hybridized with a U3 snoRNA-specific probe for normalization. All blots were repeated at least three times. (A) Steady-state abundance of reporter mRNAs in wild-type cells. Graph shows abundances of test mRNAs relative to the readthrough control. (B) Same as panel A, but in upf1D cells. Graph plots abundance of specific test mRNAs in upf1D versus wild-type cells.
