These doublestranded RNA molecules are typically 19 to 23 nucleotides in length, and consequently have a molecular weight of approximately 13 to 15 kd and 38 to 46 negative charges. As a consequence, passive transport over the lipophilic cell membrane is poor [3] [4] [5] . At the same time, intracellular entry and translocation into the cytoplasm (and/or nucleus), where the RNAi machinery is located, is a prerequisite, for gene silencing activity [6] [7] [8] [9] . More importantly, for in vivo applications, intracellular entry into the target cell within the diseased tissue is required and should lead to appearance in the cytoplasm to silence the mRNA of interest ( Figure 1 ). Ideally, siRNA should therefore be targeted to three levels: to the target tissue, the target cell type, and the subcellular compartment.",

The observations have been attributed to translocation of siRNA over the cell membrane by a dsRNA-receptor, referred to in Caenorhabditis elegans as SID-1,which is responsible in this organism for systemic spreading of the silencing effects [11] . Indeed, overexpression of the mammalian homologue increases the intracellular uptake of siRNA [12] . In contrast, \"naked\" siRNA is used by many researchers as a negative control which fails to produce silencing effects after injection in vivo and even after prolonged incubation of cells with high siRNA concentrations in vitro. This lack of activity of \"naked\" siRNA indicates that not all cell types express (enough of) the SID-1 homologue, to observe silencing effects. In addition, the rapid removal of \"naked\" siRNA after intravenous administration from the circulation, with more than 99% of the injected dose renally excreted and taken up by liver Kupffer cells within minutes, makes a very small percentage of the administered dose available for the target tissue. This small percentage is additionally subject to nuclease degradation. Therefore, intravenous injection of naked siRNA relying on passive targeting of the diseased tissue, and SID-1 homologue-mediated target cell uptake seem to be inefficient and as yet unpredictable.",

Furthermore, helper molecules (like cationic lipids or polymers) or physical methods (like electroporation, sonoporation, or hydrodynamic pressure) can be employed to facilitate intracellular entrance of siRNA [13, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .

In addition, using local injection (possibly supplemented with helper molecules or physical stimuli) selectivity in delivery to nontarget and target cell types has usually not been taken into account. This is an important aspect when considering the nonspecific effects that can be induced by dsRNA. Over the past few years, it has become clear that cells can respond strongly to siRNA by different proinflammatory reactions depending on cell type, siRNA sequence, and intracellular location [22] [23] [24] . These effects can be intensified by employing cationic helper molecules [25] , an effect probably mediated by a change in the intracellular trafficking of the dsRNA [23] .

A number of chemical modifications have been proposed to increase nuclease resistance, like boranophosphates [30] , 4 -thioribonucleosides, phosphorothioates, 2 deoxy-2 fluorouridine, 2 -O-methyl, 2 -O-(2-methoxyethyl), and locked nucleotides [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . All of these chemically modified siRNAs were still able to induce siRNA-mediating gene silencing provided that the modifications were absent in specific regions of the siRNA and included to a limited extent. These specific restrictions regarding position and degree of modifications were dependent on the characteristics of the incorporated modification. Although increased nuclease resistance of siRNA would be expected to increase in vivo silencing effects, Layzer et al showed that this is not necessarily the case. They studied silencing effects in the liver after hydrodynamic injection, and showed that unmodified siRNA had a similar potency as the stabilized version [36] .",

            "text": "Probably the furthest developed work on chemically modified siRNAs has been reported by Soutcheck et al [40] . They have developed siRNAs with partial phosphorothioate backbone modifications and 2 -O-methyl sugar variations on the sense and antisense strands to promote nuclease resistance, while at the same time cholesterol was conjugated to the 3 end of the sense strand using a pyrrolidine linker to change tissue distribution. The cholesterol-modified siRNA silenced reporter gene expression in vitro in the absence of transfection agents, something not observed for unmodified siRNAs. Probably the interaction of the cholesterol with serum components in the culture medium improved siRNA translocation over the cellular membrane. The cholesterol modification particularly enhanced binding of siRNA to serum albumin, probably explaining the prolonged circulation half-life measured after intravenous injection as compared to unmodified siRNA. In addition to a prolonged presence in the circulation, cholesterol-modified siRNAs were detected in liver and jejunum at concentrations of 100-200 ng per gram tissue 24 hours after the last injection of 50 mg/kg doses. These levels were sufficient to reduce the levels of the apolipoprotein apoB-100 in plasma by 31-68%. This reduction was paralleled by a 37% reduction in overall cholesterol levels, and reduction in high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and chylomicron levels. Despite these impressive results using relatively simple modifications, the doses of chemically modified siRNAs needed are relatively high and seem to underline that changing tissue distribution of siRNA in favor of target cell uptake by conjugation with comparatively small chemical groups is difficult to achieve. At the same time, small molecular weight modifications seem to be needed to preserve correct interaction with the RNAi enzymes. Cleavable linkers for coupling of bulkier modifications may be an approach to avoid these problems. In conclusion, chemical modifications do promise important advances regarding nuclease resistance and reduced induction of the stress response. Invitrogen has developed a second-generation siRNA, known as Stealth RNAi, in which chemical modifications are designed to increase the specificity of RNAi effects by allowing only the antisense strand to efficiently enter the RNAi pathway and eliminating induction of interferon-related pathways. Others have also demonstrated that sequence and modifications can strongly influence intensity of silencing efficiency and inflammatory reactions, providing tools to optimize these [41, 42] .",

Examples include the retargeting of murine coronavirus to the human epidermal growth factor receptor [55] , directing adenovirus via fibroblast growth factor ligand towards its associated receptor (FGFR1) for delivery to glioma, or adenoviral delivery to angiogenic endothelium via RGD-peptides binding alpha v-integrins [56] .

A cationic functional group is usually required to bind and condense the nucleic acid, thereby protecting it against nucleases and (important for siRNA) increasing the apparent molecular weight above the renal clearance cut-off. In addition, some cationic compounds are being used as endosomal escape enhancers. Due to the resulting positive charge, complexes tend to form aggregates by binding in the blood stream to negatively charged biomolecules. As a result, their clearance is usually rapid. Moreover, such cationic complexes possess a propensity to interact with virtually any cell type they encounter, creating a need to insulate the interactive surface of the particle to promote specificity. For that purpose, shielding groups can be added to enhance colloidal stability and reduce surface charge thereby avoiding nonspecific cell uptake. To restore cell interaction in a target-specific manner targeting ligands can be coupled to induce site-specific binding and uptake. In the case of delivery of DNA encoding for shRNA by non-viral delivery systems, nuclear translocation of the DNA is often inadequate. As such, the cytoplasmic site of activity of chemically synthesized siRNA provides an important advantage.",

This system was highly efficient in binding to and transfection of cells expressing HIV-envelope protein, although it is unclear why the HIV-envelope protein would be internalized. Importantly, expression of interferon\u03b2, 2 , 5 -oligoadenylate synthetase, and Stat-1, as indicators of nonspecific effects, were not increased upon siRNA transfection of HIV-envelope-expressing melanoma cells. In addition, when these cells formed subcutaneous tumors in vivo, 30% of cells took up fluorescent siRNA when delivered by F105-P after intravenous administration. Naked siRNA was not taken up, nor was F105-P-siRNA delivered to cells that were envelope-protein negative. Delivery of a combination of siRNAs against c-myc, MDM2, VEGF strongly inhibited tumor growth in vivo when delivered using the F105-P system. This combination of siRNAs attacking the tumor at multiple fronts is an important advantage of the siRNA technology as it allows simultaneous interference with a number of different pathways, while the delivery problem for each individual drug molecule (siRNA) remains the same. The versatility of this targeted system was demonstrated by exchanging the HIV-envelope antibody for an ErbB2-antibody changing the specificity of the system to ErbB2-positive breast carcinoma cells.",

In a therapeutic setting, siRNA against murine VEGF receptor-2 was used, since the receptor is one of the driving factors of tumor angiogenesis. Delivery to host tumor endothelium is required to inhibit tumor proliferation. Efficacy studies with VEGFR2-specific siRNA complexed in RGD-PEG-PEI nanoparticles resulted in strong inhibition of sc neuroblastoma growth rate, which was sequence-specific. These experiments suggest that the targeted shielded nanoparticles indeed deliver the siRNA to the angiogenic endothelial cells. In line with these findings, the reduced tumor growth rate was paralleled by a reduction in blood vessels in the periphery of the tumor and changes in vascular morphology of remaining vessels, supporting an antiangiogenic mechanism of action. These results were supported by studies in a model of pathological angiogenesis in the eye [70] , again demonstrating vasculature-specific delivery and inhibition of angiogenesis leading to therapeutic effects. Importantly, the studies in the eye also showed that combining siRNAs against different driving factors in the VEGF-pathway in the same delivery system improved therapeutic effects. Attacking the various receptors and growth factors simultaneously seems to offer advantages. Especially in multifactorial diseases, where functional redundancy is likely, this cocktail approach seems to offer important benefits. Synthetic nonviral delivery systems are a diverse class of molecules used in different nucleic acid delivery strategies that range from relatively simple cationic complexation for local administration to targeted shielded systems for intravenous injection. Their adaptability to specific targeting requirements is an important advantage, although optimization of delivery efficiency continues to remain important.",

As a result siRNA has been able to make a remarkable rapid progress from initial discovery as functional mediator of RNA interference in mammalian cells in 2001 to three clinical trials at the end of 2005: two in age-related macular degeneration, the other in respiratory syncytial virus infection [71] . Nevertheless, the choice of the diseases also reflects the delivery difficulties encountered for this class of nucleic acids. These diseases were selected partly because the target cell delivery problems are relatively low as these pathologies are confined to specific and accessible sites. To further improve target specificity, also in view of possible adverse effects occurring when siRNA is processed by nontarget cells, and to allow application of siRNA for systemic treatment several strategies can be proposed (Figure 2 ). Taken together they serve to increase nuclease resistance, to reduce renal excretion/specific cell uptake, to promote uptake by the target cells, and to ensure correct intracellular trafficking to the site of action. As the first preclinical proofs of principle have been delivered showing therapeutic effects of locally and systemically delivered siRNAs, it is expected that these strategies will soon translate into viable clinical development programs.",
