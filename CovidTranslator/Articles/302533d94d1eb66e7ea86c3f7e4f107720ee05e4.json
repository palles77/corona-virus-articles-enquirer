The populace of discrete countries can no longer consider themselves remote from the risk of incursion of a wide variety of infectious diseases of public health and veterinary significance. 1, 2 It is widely acknowledged that increasing globalization, whether with respect to movement of people or trade in animals or animal products, provides greater opportunities for the rapid and widespread dissemination of a variety of diseases from country to country and within countries, a situation that is historically unprecedented. The ever-increasing volume of international movement has given rise to a major paradigm shift in the geographic distribution of many diseases. Fewer and fewer diseases can now be regarded as \"geographically restricted\" or \"compartmentalized\" to certain areas of the world.",

An analogous situation exists in various countries in the Western Hemisphere in which WNV has adapted itself remarkably well and become endemic since its first known introduction into North America (United States) in 1999 and now has resurged again in 2012 in humans in the United States. 4 It took only 5 years for WNV to become established in 48 of the 50 states in the United States.",

In the process, however, such changes have inevitably increased the risk of spread of various equine diseases. Before elaborating on specific factors involved in the international dissemination of equine diseases in detail, it is important to appreciate the transformation that the equine industry in many countries has undergone over the past 50 to 60 years. Since the 1960s, there has been an unprecedented upsurge in the growth of the horse industry in many countries, both for commercial and recreational purposes. Consideration of the increased prominence of the equine industry worldwide must acknowledge the resurgence of interest in the horse through leisure activities. The 2005 Economic Impact Study carried out in the United States identified recreation as the single largest equine-related activity, involving 3.9 million horses of an estimated national equid population of 9.2 million animals. 6 The most significant factor in this development was the favorable economic climate enjoyed by these countries over this period. National economics flourished from changes in the global market structure under various multinational trade agreements. 7 Among the industries to benefit has been the equine industry, with a resultant increase in the volume of international trade in equids and semen. The trend toward globalization of the equine industry received further impetus after establishment of the World Trade Organization 63 Infectious Diseases and International Movement of Horses Peter J. Timoney C H A P T E R estimated 6.9 million in the mid-1990s to 9.2 million in 2005. Both impact studies dramatically demonstrated the major contribution of the horse industry to the national economy. In the 2005 study, the combined contributions of the direct, indirect, and induced effects of the industry (in terms of Gross Domestic Product) were assessed at more than $102 billion. 6 The industry provides considerable employment, estimated at 1.4 million full-time equivalent jobs annually. Until the widespread financial recession in the last few years, revenue from the sale of equids had risen steadily, grossing in excess of $2 billion at its peak.",

The number of highly prestigious and lucrative equine competitive events has proliferated around the world in the past 15 to 20 years. 3 This is well illustrated by the increase in number of major equestrian events held under the aegis of the International Equestrian Federation (FEI); these events have nearly doubled over the past 8 years alone. Attracted by the considerable prize monies involved, owners are shipping their horses many thousands of miles, sometimes from the Northern to the Southern Hemisphere, or vice versa, to compete in international equestrian or racing events. Transporting horses over significant distances for competition purposes has inherent risks (e.g., traumatic injuries, shipping fever). Nonetheless, the number of prestigious international events will likely continue to increase, with escalation in the volume of movement of horses, despite the inherent health risks involved.",

The horse has joined the list of animal and plant commodities that are traded globally. 3 To date, relatively few countries have attempted to assess the impact of their respective industries on their national economies. Limited studies have been done in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Mexico, all of which underscore the important cultural and economic value of the horse in these countries. 12 Australia and the United States have carried out comprehensive studies of their respective equine industries. 6, [13] [14] [15] The American Horse Council Foundation commissioned an economic impact study of the horse industry in the United States in the mid-1990s 6 and again 10 years later. 14 Comparison of the findings of the two studies revealed that the U.S. equid population had increased considerably over the intervening period, from an which are primarily vector-borne infections but can also be transmitted iatrogenically. Besides the potential for many equine diseases to be introduced and effectively spread by respiratory, venereal, or vector-borne routes, agents can be transferred between countries by other means, which, although less frequently encountered, should not be overlooked. A limited number of pathogens (e.g., EHV-1 and EHV-4, T. equigenitalis) can be introduced into a country through the importation of a pregnant mare that is harboring these organisms in utero. In such cases, the potential for spread of these pathogens is at the time of foaling. 3 A final means of introduction of a disease agent is through importation of an equid infested with the intermediate state of a parasite such as the larvae of the botfly, Cochliomyia hominivorax, the cause of screwworm myiasis. 3 In sporadic but repeated cases, horses imported into the United States from certain South American countries (e.g., Argentina, Venezuela) have been found infested with these larvae on postentry inspection.",

Approximately 1100 stallions and mares were exposed during the occurrence, with the cost to the industry and the government of several million dollars. Experience over the years has repeatedly reaffirmed the ease with which various equine diseases have been disseminated globally through the international trade in equids and semen. 5 Such incursions have had major financial repercussions for the horse industry in affected countries. Aside from significant disruption to racing or other equine performance events and perhaps to a country's breeding industry, occurrences of transboundary diseases can have a long-term effect on international trade. This can best be illustrated by the restrictions on importation of equids that many countries impose on any country or region thereof affected with AHS. In addition to equine health and economic consequences, the introduction of certain transboundary equine diseases (e.g., VEE, glanders) can have a major impact on public health.",

Equine influenza has frequently been spread through international movement and has occasionally been responsible for widespread epidemics of disease in immunologically na\u00efve or inadequately protected horses. Such occurrences have had a major economic impact on the racing industries in affected countries. The first recorded introduction of EIV into the racing population in Hong Kong in 1986 resulted in the cancellation of seven race meetings and financial losses totaling almost $1 billion. 20 Similarly, the disease had a major impact on the racing industry in South Africa after it was first introduced in 1992 21 and reintroduced in 2003. 22 The latter epidemic affected an estimated 3700 horses in training (40% of the country's racehorse population) at Cape Town, Johannesburg, and Port Elizabeth and approximately 3000 other equids. Loss in revenue to the equine industry from this epidemic was estimated at more than 60 million rand. The most recent major epidemic of EIV occurred in Australia in 2007. 23 This was traced to the importation of a number of subclinically infected shuttle stallions from Japan. Breaches in biosecurity at a postentry quarantine station led to escape of the virus and very extensive spread of the disease among the horse populations in southern Queensland and New South Wales. Estimated economic impact of this epidemic exceeded 1 billion dollars.",

In the past 20 to 30 years, the United States has been the recipient of two mosquito species, Aedes albopictus (Stegomyia albopicta) or Asian tiger mosquito and Ochlerotatus japonicus, neither of which was previously known to occur in the country. 32, 33 Both mosquito species have been found to be competent vectors of certain equine viral encephalomyelitides, especially Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) and West Nile encephalitis. 7 Since their known introduction, the two mosquito species have established themselves and are currently becoming widely distributed in an increasing number of states. countries could regulate for the control of infectious diseases of plants and animals under the organization's Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement. 8 The key provisions of that agreement are aimed at facilitating international trade in animals, including animal germplasm, by reducing preimport and postimport health requirements among participating countries. 7 It could be rightly argued that easing trade restrictions and related testing requirements enhances the risk of introducing transboundary diseases while limiting a country's ability to protect its equine industry from the incursion of various equine pathogens. Currently, there is no compelling justification for reducing existing preentry and postentry health requirements for equids imported into the United States on the pretext of furthering international trade. To do so would undoubtedly heighten the risk of introducing a range of equine diseases, some transboundary and others presently endemic in the United States equid population. An example in point is the number of stallions and mares imported from Europe over the past 15 years that turned out to be carriers of CEM on postentry quarantine and testing. All had been tested in their respective countries of origin and were certified negative for the carrier state prior to export. The potential economic consequences for the domestic horse industry from any such incursions could far outweigh the financial benefits to be gained from facilitating international trade.",

It has become increasingly difficult, however, for countries to uphold policies based on overly restrictive import controls in today's global economic climate. They are perceived in conflict with the overall goal of the WTO, which is to eliminate or reduce unjustified protectionist barriers to trade among member countries. 9 It is freely accepted that the economic viability and success of the horse industry worldwide is critically dependent on the ability to ship horses within a state, a country, or internationally, without excessive restrictions on movement. With the aim of reducing the level of risk of disease spread from such movements, regulatory authorities have developed specific control measures to prevent the introduction and potential dissemination of a range of equine diseases into the importing country. To assist in formulation of their animal health import policies, the Office International des Epizootics (OIE), now the World Organization for Animal Health as recognized by the WTO, has developed a Terrestrial Animal Health Code that provides countries worldwide with principal control standards for preventing the spread of specific diseases listed by the OIE, including those of equids. 39 Regardless of country of origin or destination, horses are shipped internationally under license/ permit issued by the appropriate regulatory agent in the exporting country. This documentation serves as a means of individual animal identification, certification of health and freedom from contact with various equine diseases, and a The United States is not unique in respect to the availability of new vectors. Other countries in both the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere have had similar experiences. 3 Such incursions, mostly of species of mosquito, have been short-lived in some cases, whereas in other cases the new vector has become permanently established in its new habitat as exemplified by Aedes albopictus in northeastern Italy.",

Birds are also thought to be responsible for the occasional reintroduction of WNV into various countries in southern Europe and the Middle East from the African continent. 37 There is little doubt that migratory birds have been primarily responsible for the spread of this virus from the United States into Mexico, Central America, and certain Caribbean countries over the past several years.

Such sharing of information facilitates the process of risk assessment analysis between countries and enhances opportunities for reduction or elimination of unjustified restrictions on international trade in equids, semen, and embryos. At a national level, monitoring, surveillance, and reporting serves as a means of early detection of a disease that has already gained entry, whether a transboundary or endemic disease. It cannot be overemphasized how important a role the practicing veterinarian and the horse owner play in ensuring the success of any surveillance and reporting system and in helping to monitor the health integrity of their equine industry.",

Horses must be held in preexport quarantine for a specified period, during which they are subjected to the necessary clinical examination and laboratory tests prescribed by the importing country. Of critical importance to ensuring the integrity of sampling and testing of horses for export is the need for some form of permanent individual identification such as a unique animal identification number (microchip) or alternative system of permanent identification (iris scanning, retinal scanning). Poor or inferior systems of animal identification increase the potential for willful substitution of horses before shipment and enhance the disease risks involved.",

For example, over the past 15 years alone, a total of 36 stallions and mares imported into the United States from Europe were confirmed carriers of T. equigenitalis on postentry quarantine and testing.

Proof of concept that this was achievable was the \"Equine Disease-Free Facility\" that was developed in Guangdong Province in PR China. It enabled the country to host the equine program of the 2010 Asian Games. The detailed advance planning, discussions, and negotiations that took place between the relevant international agencies and ruling bodies and the national and provincial animal health authorities in China were crucial to ensuring the success of this unique initiative.

It has been recognized for many years that the risk of disease transfer is not necessarily equivalent among different categories of horses. For several reasons, high-value performance horses can be considered a lower risk category. Because of the frequency with which they travel internationally, they are tested more often and monitored more closely for a range of the most important diseases. Additionally, their vaccination status for diseases of significance is likely to be current. The goal of this initiative is to establish a strategic framework for countries and regions to harmonize their approach to sanitary conditions for the international movement of performance horses. Objectives are to (1) maintain the high health status of performance horses and minimize the risk of transboundary disease transmission while removing unjustified health requirements; (2) ensure the welfare of the",
