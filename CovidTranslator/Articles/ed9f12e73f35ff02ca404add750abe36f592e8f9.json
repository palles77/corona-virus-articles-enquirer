In particular, the infection occurs via the binary interaction between the uninfected and infected individuals. Then, the local epidemic spread can be modeled on the basis of the stochastic Boltzmann type equation. In this paper, the normalized virus titer inside the infected human body is defined as the function of the elapsed time, which is measured from the infection time. Consequently, the probability of the infection at the binary human interaction increases, as the normalized virus titer inside the human body increases, whereas the normalized virus titer inside the infected human body decreases, after the normalized virus titer reaches to its maximum value, namely, unity, in the characteristic time. Numerical results indicate that the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains depends on such a characteristic time, strongly, when the Knudsen number and temperature are fixed. Such a dependency of the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains on the characteristic time can be described by the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov equation which is introduced from the stochastic Boltzmann type equation. Finally, we consider three types of the human behavior as plausible actions to the local epidemic spread.",

            "text": "The epidemic spread sometimes does serious harms to humankind on the earth. In Tokio Marine and Nichido Risk Consulting Co., Ltd, 5-1, Otemachi, 1-Chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan and do harms to people, previously. Thus, the quantitative prediction of the epidemic spread is markedly significant to suppress harms by the virus at minimum. The most classical mathematical-model to demonstrate the epidemic spread was proposed by Kermack and McKendrick [5] as SIR model (S: susceptible, I: infected, R: removed/recovered). In SIR model, numbers of individuals in statuses S, I, and R are temporally evolved. Similarly, the extended model of SIR model, such as SIRS with the birth and death [6] , SIRS model [7] and SIR model with other counterparts [8] , were proposed. These SIR type models are simultaneous ordinary derivative equations in terms of the time (t \u2208 R + ). Thus, the epidemic spread in the physical space is not considered in SIR type models. To demonstrate the epidemic spread in physical space, the epidemic dynamics in the phase space (t, x) (in R + \u00d7 X 3 , X 3 \u2286 R 3 ) must be considered. Cardy and Grassberger [9] considered the epidemic spread on network in the physical space using SIR model and found the similarity between the epidemic spread and percolation on the network. In recent studies by Barrat and his coworkers [10] [11] [12] [13] , the epidemic spread on the basis of the complex network theory has been investigated. Additionally, the lattice gas cellular automaton analysis of the epidemic spread was proposed by Fuks and Lawniczak [14] . For example, the epidemic spread in Japan is calculated using 69 nodes (major cities), where the number of inhabitants is large, adequately. Two nodes are connected, when the distance between two cities is shorter than the critical value. The individuals move from one node to other nodes, when they are connected each other. Figure 1 shows the fraction of the infected individuals (number of infected individuals at a node/total number of individuals at a node) at t = 0 and 10, in which t is the normalized time. At t = 0, the infected individuals exist in Okayama city. Readers can easily understand that the number of nodes with high fraction of infected individuals increases, as the time passes from the frame at t = 10. Theses studies of the epidemic spread in framework of the network theory or lattice gas cellar automaton are useful for understanding of the epidemic spread from a point (cell) to a point (cell) without tracing motions of infected individuals. Generally, the congested areas and depopulated areas sparsely exist in the country. Then, the epidemic spread from one node to the other node is reasonable approach. Meanwhile, we cannot explain the \"local\" epidemic spread inside a node using SIR model. Therefore, we must consider the local epidemic spread among individuals in the multi-agents system by tracing motions of individuals in order to investigate the local epidemic spread inside a node (city, village, county etc.).",

Provided that infections from infected individuals to uninfected individuals occur via binary interactions, exclusively, binary interactions occur, when the distance between two individuals is less than the two times of the effective diameter of an individuals, in which the effective domain of an individual is expressed with the volume of a sphere with an effective diameter (d). Then, d must be determined to reflect a droplet infection together with the contact infection. Such a long range interaction can be expressed with an intermolecular potential [15] . After all, the local epidemic spread on the basis of such motions of individuals can be formulated by the \"stochastic\" Boltzmann type equation. The kinetic equation such as the stochastic Boltzmann type equation is certainly useful for a calculation of a large number of individuals, which is hard to trace of motion of each of individuals [16] . Here, readers remind that the phrase \"stochastic\" means that a small number of individuals also can be discussed in the framework of the kinetic theory [17] .",

            "text": "A serious problem involved with SIR model is that transition rates such as S \u2192 I and I \u2192 R cannot be determined in the framework of the macroscopic scale. Provided that the infection status is expressed with the virus titer, we expect that a series of the infection process (uninfected \u2192 infected \u2192 recovery) can be understood with only one parameter, namely, the virus titer. A novelty of this paper is a kinetic modeling and computation of the epidemic spread using one parameter, namely, virus titer, whereas SIR type models distinguish individuals using three parameters (S, I and R). Readers readily understand SIR model allows the recovery of individuals, whose infection-interval is markedly shorter than the usual infection-term, because the transition of I \u2192 R can occur when a chosen random number (\u2208 [0, 1]) is smaller than the transition probability. Of course, an immunity is also another significant parameter to express the susceptibility of an individual toward the virus, which characterizes the probability of the infection of an individual. We, however, assume that the immunity is uniform for all the individuals to simplify our discussion. The virus tier, which is excited from zero by the binary interaction with the infected individual with some probability, is the state variable, which depends on the elapsed time after the infection. Then, the probability of the infection at the binary interaction is determined using the virus titer inside the infected individual. In particular, the normalized virus titer ( p \u2208 [0, 1]) is defined as a function of the elapsed time (\u03c4 ), which is measured from the start time of the infection. Such a function must be determined to fit to real datum of the virus titer versus the elapsed time, as discussed by Beccam et al. [18] , whereas the normalized virus titer is defined as a Gaussian function of the elapsed time to simplify our discussion. Therefore, the realistic function of the normalized virus titer is set as our future study.",

The primary aim of this paper is the comprehension of the characteristics of the local epidemic spread at the initial stage, which changes in accordance with variations of parameters in the stochastic Boltzmann type equation. In particular, we consider the local epidemic spread at the initial stage in the framework of the kinetic theory. Therefore, we never postulate the epidemic spread via vehicles such as cars, trains or airplanes, which were discussed by Colizza et al. [12] . Hence, the time scale of the evolution of the virus titer and time scale of motion of individuals are set unspecified parameters, because we never specify the species of the virus. Additionally, we never mention to multi-epidemic-sources and restrict ourselves to single epidemic-source (domain) to simplify our discussion. In numerical analyses of the stochastic Boltzmann type equation, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method [19] on the basis of the null time counter (NTC) method by Bird [19] is applied. The DSMC method to solve the stochastic Boltzmann equation, which demonstrates the epidemic spread on the basis of the virus titer, is surely new approach to analyses of the epidemic spread, whereas the numerical algorithm in the DSMC is similar to conventional one [19] which has been used to solve the Boltzmann equation for reactive gases, because the Monte Carlo judgment of the transition of the uninfected individual to the infected individual is similar to the Monte Carlo judgment of the chemical reaction via a binary collision in reactive gases [19] . Here, readers must remind that we solve the \"stochastic\" Boltzmann type equation, in which the phrase \"stochastic\" means that Klimontovich's distribution function [20] is considered in order to investigate effects of thermal fluctuations on the local epidemic spread. We introduce the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov (FKPP) equation [21] from the stochastic Boltzmann type equation in order to calculate the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains. Finally, the local epidemic spread via three types of extended human behaviors (stochastic lethal/quarantine without interactions, hypokinetia, and refugee-quarantine with interactions) in accordance with the local epidemic spread is investigated. One advantage of the kinetic model based on the virus titer over SIR model is that we can construct a flexible mathematical-model to reflect scenarios of actions of individuals in accordance with the virus titer of the infected individual (i.e, quarantine, refugee, hypokinesia etc.). In this paper, we primarily focus on the local epidemic spread owing to the thermal motion of individuals which does not postulate the intended velocity of pedestrians, because our aim of the study is an investigation of the local epidemic spread on the basis of the virus titer coupled with thermal motions of individuals in the framework of the kinetic theory. Thus, further advanced interaction models beyond the isotropic scattering in the binary collision between two pedestrians, which were proposed by Helbing [15] or Gipps and Marksj\u00f6 [22] , are not discussed in this paper, because the author considers that the investigation of the local epidemic spread, which includes the detailed dynamics of pedestrians, seems to be out of scope of this study. We, however, mention to the local epidemic spread, in which intended velocities of pedestrians are fixed to their constant values in \"Appendix\" in order to prove that the proposed kinetic model can be extended to more realistic model of the local epidemic spread in our future study. Finally, the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) like term is added to the stochastic Boltzmann equation to describe the relaxation of velocities of pedestrians toward their intended velocities. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2.1, the stochastic Boltzmann type equation for the local epidemic spread via the binary collision between the infected and uninfected individuals is formulated. In Sect. 2.2, the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains is calculated from the FKPP equation, which is introduced from the stochastic Boltzmann type equation. In Sect. 2.3, DSMC analyses of the local epidemic spread are performed to investigate effects of parameters, which are used in the stochastic Boltzmann type equation, on the local epidemic spread. In Sect. 3, three types of the human behavior in accordance with the local epidemic spread are modeled and characteristics of three types of the human behavior in accordance with the local epidemic spread are investigated, numerically. Finally, we make concluding remarks in Sect. 4.",

(1) inside the domain U att = 0, whereas individuals inside the domain X \u2212 U, who have p = 0 att = 0, are uninfected. The schematic of the calculation domain (X) is shown in Fig. 5 (Table 1 ). Figure 6 shows the time evolution ofp in Test A-1. The infected domain spreads at 0 \u2264t \u2264 1.0, concentrically, where the center of the concentric spread is, certainly, X ,\u1ef8 = (0.5, 0.5). At\u03c4 m = 1.0 in Eq. (1), p of the individual, who is infected att = 0, reaches to unity at\u03c4 = 1. Consequently,p increases toward X ,\u1ef8 = (0.5, 0.5) and reaches to 0.895 at X ,\u1ef8 = (0.5, 0.5) att = 1, where we remind thatp is not equal to unity at t = 1, because individuals, who are infected att > 0 and have p (\u03c4 ) < 1 owing to\u03c4 < 1, (1) must be damped to zero, rapidly, before the interaction with the uninfected individuals. Such a situation can be obtained by using p (\u03c4 c ) 1 (\u03c4 c : inverse of the averaged collision frequency), when\u03c4 m <\u03c4 c . Next, we investigate the effect of\u03c4 m on the local epidemic spread by considering Test B. Figure 7 shows the time evolution ofp in Test B. The infected domain spreads, concentrically in a similar way to Test A. The propagation speed ofp in Test B is higher than that in Test A-1. From Eq. (7), the propagation of the infected domain depends on the spatial propagation via \u2207 x \u03c1 0p0 \u03b4u p 0 and generation of \u03c1 0p0 via G p 0 . We remind thatp is related (1) rather than the increase in \u03b4u p 0 , because our numerical results indicate that \u03b4\u0169 p 0 t at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-1 is similar to that in Test B. Such a similarity between \u03b4\u0169 p 0 t at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-1 and that in Test B indicates that D in Test A-1 is similar to that in Test B. In short, the difference between the propagation speed of the boundary domain between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-1 and that in Test B is caused by the relation K 01 | Test A-1 K 01 | Test B as a result of Eq. (23). Next, we consider on effects of velocity fluctuations via thermal fluctuations by comparing ofp, which are obtained in Tests A-1, 2 and 3. In the DSMC method to solve the stochastic Boltzmann type equation, the velocity fluctuations (\u03b4u) depend on the number of sample particles in a lattice (N c ), which is averaged during some time interval, such that [29] ",

Figure 8 shows snapshots ofp in Tests A-1, A-2 and A-3 att = 1.0 (upper frames) and t = 1.536 (lower frames). Figure 8 shows that there are not marked differences between contours ofp in Test A-1 and those in Test A-2 att = 1.0 and 1.536, whereas there are marked differences between contours ofp in Test A-1 and those in Test A-3 att = 1.0 and 1.536, because the infected domain never spreads concentrically in Test A-3. From Eq. (24), we can conjecture that \u03b4\u0169 2 in Test A-1 is a half of that in Test A-2 and 1/10 times of that in Test A-3, because\u03b8 is fluctuating around 5 at 0 \u2264t in Tests A-1, 2 and 3. The dependency of the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains on \u03b4\u0169 is ignorable, because there are no marked differences among the area of the infected domain in Test A-1 and those in Tests A-2 and A-3 att = 1 and 1.536, as shown in Fig. 8 . Consequently, the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains strongly depends on the collisional term G p 0 in Eq. (7), in other words, K 01 in Eq. (23) . Next, we investigatef (\u03c4 ) := V 3f t,x, p (\u03c4 ) ,\u1e7d dv 3 . We set \u03c4 = 0.02 in the range of 0 \u2264\u03c4 \u2264 2.f (\u03c4 ) is the set of simple functionsf ( \u03c4 \u00d7 i) (i \u2208 Z + ) on Lebesgue measur\u1ebd \u03c4 \u2208 i \u00d7 \u03c4 , (i + 1) \u00d7 \u03c4 ). Then, 0 \u2264\u03c4 \u2264 \u03c4 includes both uninfected individuals and infected individuals, whose elapsed time is in the range of 0 \u2264\u03c4 \u2264 \u03c4 . Figure 10 shows in Test C occur more frequently than that does in Test B, because the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test C is lower than that in Test B. Consequently, the range of\u03c4 , which yieldsf (\u03c4 ) = 0, namely, sum of Lebesgue measure, which yieldsf (\u03c4 ) = 0, becomes the longer, as\u03c4 m becomes the longer. In summary, the ratio of the number of individuals, who are infected at other lattices (domains), to the total number of infected individuals at the specific lattice (domain) decreases, as \u03c4 m decreases, because the local epidemic spread occurs inside the lattice rapidly via one or a few of invasions of the infected individuals from neighboring lattices, before some infected individuals reach to neighboring lattice, because the virus titer increases rapidly inside the lattice owing to small \u03c4 m from Eq. (2). Figure 12 shows the sample particles (individuals), which are calculated using the DSMC method, in Test C (att = 0.6) and Test A-1 (att = 0.88). A sphere corresponds to one individual, where the diameter of a sphere is expressed with enlarged Fig. 12 . Consequently, we confirm that a small\u03c4 m yields the rapid local epidemic spread via the binary collision between the infected and uninfected individuals, once a infected individual invades to the outside of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains. Thus, the infected individual with the large velocity becomes a seed of the local epidemic spread, which will be confirmed in the discussion of \u03b4u p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Fig. 13 . Consequently, such a higher velocity of the infected individuals at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains attributes to the finite diffusion flux from Eq. (14) at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains.",

Orders of such two ratios of the traveling wave front are similar to those calculated using Eq. (23), as shown in Fig. 4 . Finally, the propagation speed of the traveling wave front depends on\u03c4 m strongly, as predicted by discussions in Sect. 2.2.",

Figure 13 shows snapshots of the vector field (\u0169 p 0 ,\u1e7d p 0 ) in Tests A-1 (left frame) and A-4 (middle frame) att = 1.0 and A-5 (right frame) att = 0.72, where\u0169 p 0 := (\u0169 p 0 ,\u1e7d p 0 ,w p 0 ). The propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-4 is slightly lower than that in Test A-1, whereas the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-5 is markedly higher than that in Test A-1. As a result, the increase in \u03be yields the slight increase in the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains owing to the increase in the collision frequency, because the majorant collision frequency [30] is determined using 1 <\u1ebc max in the DSMC calculation. Additionally, the increase in\u03b8 yields the increase in \u03b4u p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains, which leads to more rapid propagation of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in Test A-5 than that in Test A-1. ig. 14 Snapshots ofp att = 1.0 in Tests A-6 (upper-left frame) and A-1 (upper-right frame), and at t = 1.536 in Tests A-6 (lower-left frame) and A-1 (lower-right frame) uals with the large velocity, who determine the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains, increases, as\u03b8 increases. Actually, we can confirm that the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains depends on not \u03b4\u0169 but \u03b4\u0169 p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains from Figs. 7 and 13. The increase in \u03b4u p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains owing to the increase in\u03b8 can be explained by the fact that D increases in accordance with the increase in\u03b8 due toD \u221d\u03b8 \u03be/2 in Eq. (14) . Meanwhile, K 01 also increases in accordance with the increase in\u03b8 , when \u03be > 0. Thus, it is still open problem whether the increase in the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains via the increase in\u03b8 is caused by the increase in D or K 01 in Eq. (23) . Meanwhile, the description of the relation between \u03b4\u0169 and \u03b4\u0169 p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains is set as our future study. In Fig. 13 , we find that \u03b4u p 0 at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains tend to be lager than \u03b4u p 0 inside the infected domain. Such a tendency indicates that the virus tier is correlated to the velocity of the individual such as f ( p, v) C ( p, v) ) is the correlation function).",

Then, the infection with small\u03c4 m can spread by a few invasions of infected individuals to the uninfected domain, when the interaction between the infected and uninfected individuals is allowable. Consequently, we must pay attention to the local epidemic spread with the small\u03c4 m by suppressing movements of infected individuals not to invade to the uninfected domain. Of course, the local epidemic spread can be accelerated by the transport of the infected individuals to the uninfected domain using the vehicle, when\u03c4 m is small. 1 (iii) The infected individual with the large velocity can invade to the uninfected domain, more frequently than those with the small velocity. The higher velocity of the infected individuals than that of the uninfected individuals at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains yields the finite diffusion flux, which is expressed by Eq. (14) . Then, the infected individual with the large velocity can be a seed of the infection in the uninfected domain, more frequently than those with the small velocity. Consequently, the virus titer p is correlated to |v| in f (t, p, v, x) . The diffusion flux resulted from the difference between such two velocities at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains enables us to demonstrate the dynamics of the epidemic spread using the FKPP equation in Eq.

            "text": "The stochastic Boltzmann type equation was formulated to demonstrate the local epidemic spread in the local domain at the initial stage by focusing on the time evolution of the virus titer inside the infected individual. The propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains strongly depends on the characteristic time of the virus titer, namely, \u03c4 m , whereas the individual with the higher velocity becomes a seed of the local epidemic Vector fields (\u0169,\u1e7d) att = 1.0, 2.16 and 3.98, which are obtained using Model C with \u03ba r = 10 and \u03ba a = 100 spread at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains, the more frequently, as \u03c4 m decreases. The analytical result of the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains is obtained using the FKPP equation. The dependency of the propagation speed on \u03c4 m , which is analytically estimated using the FKPP equation, is numerically confirmed with some good accuracies. Additionally, the absolute value of the fluctuating flow velocity of infected individuals, namely, \u03b4|u p 0 | , at the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains increase in accordance with the increase in the initial temperature. The increase in \u03b4|u p 0 | yields the increase in the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains. Such an increase in the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains owing to the increase in the initial temperature can be explained by increases in D and K 01 (0 < \u03be) in the framework of the FKPP equation, as shown in Eq. (23) . The ratio of the number of individuals, who are infected at other lattices (domains), to the total number of infected individuals at the specific lattice (domain) decreases, as \u03c4 m decreases, because the local epidemic spread occurs inside the lattice rapidly via one or a few of invasions of the infected individuals from neighboring lattices, before some infected individuals reach to neighboring lattice, because the virus titer increases rapidly inside the cell owing to small \u03c4 m . Meanwhile, the change of the velocity fluctuations via the change of the number of sample particles does not affect the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains. The dependency of the collision frequency on the total kinetic energy of two interacting individuals indicates that the stronger dependency of the collision frequency on the total kinetic energy yields the faster propagation of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains owing to the increase in K 01 (\u03be > 0). Finally, three types of the human behavior in accordance with the local epidemic spread was considered. In Model A, the more rapid death or quarantine of infected individuals, which is done not to interact with other uninfected individuals, yields the more uninfected individuals under t \u2192 +\u221e. In model B, the hypokinesia of infected individuals yields the concentration of individuals around the center of the infected domain. Consequently, Model B fails to delay the local epidemic spread owing to the increase in the collision frequency between the infected and uninfected individuals around the center of the infected domain. In Model C, the quarantine of the infected individuals inside the specific area was expressed with the attractive force, whereas the refugee of the uninfected individuals from the infected individuals was expressed with the repulsive force. Indeed, Model C succeeded the delay of the local epidemic spread, whereas the allowance of interactions between the infected and uninfected individuals leads to the result that all the individuals in the calculation domain are infected. Various types of the combination of Models A, B and C together with the realistic dynamics of pedestrians in \"Appendix\" are interesting in our future study together with the comparison of numerical results, which are obtained using our kinetic model, with real datum of the local epidemic spread.",

Additionally, we have assumed the isotropic scattering after the binary collision, which might be rough model to describe the characteristics of the dynamics of the pedestrians [15] . For example, the number of pedestrian, who go back to the direction, which has been walked, after the binary collision is presumably less than that of pedestrian, who go straight toward the intended direction after the binary collision. Therefore, we must set the weight on the small deflection angle in order to emphasize the grazing collision, which does not change intended velocities of colliding two pedestrian. Such stress on the small deflection angle is attained by changing a weighting parameter in the deflection angle in the Variable Soft Sphere (VSS) model [31] . Additionally, the kinetic equation beyond the stochastic Boltzmann equation (i.e., Enskog equation) must be considered to demonstrate packing effects via the high volume fraction in X 3 occupied by pedestrian [32] . Finally, the sophistication of the collisional process in the local epidemic spread, which considers the characteristics of pedestrian, will be set as our future study.",

The author recommends readers to access to another type of the Boltzmann type equation proposed by Helbing [33] , which demonstrates the collisional dynamics between two pedestrians by setting the intended velocity as a dependent variable in the distribution function. In our numerical tests in Sects. 2.2 and 3, the initial distribution function is obtained using the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Similarly, we consider the numerical condition att = 0, which is quite same as that in Test A-1. Additionally, we assume that the intended velocities of pedestrian are equal to those att = 0. Figure 20 showsp att = 1.34, which are obtained using Eq. (32), when\u03bd = 0.25 (left frame), 0.5 (middle frame) and 1 (right frame), in which\u03bd := \u03bdt \u221e .

As a result, we find that the intended velocity is a key parameter to determine the propagation of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains.",

            "text": "Three characteristics domains, S 1 , S 2 and S 3 , which are defined as are obtained att = 1.p in S 1 and S 2 is larger than that in S 3 , whereasp = 0 in X\u2212S 1 \u2212S 2 \u2212S 3 . Consequently, the propagation of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in the\u1ef8 -direction is suppressed owing to the intended velocities of pedestrians, namely, (\u00b11, 0), as confirmed by comparing of the contour ofp att = 1 in Fig. 5 with that in Fig. 21 . Subsequently, four characteristic infected domains, S 1 , S 2 , S 4 and S 5 , which are defined as S 1 and S 2 are obtained as a result of time evolutions of S 1 and S 2 att = 1, respectively. Consequently, most of pedestrians in S 1 and S 2 recover from the infection, as confirmed b\u0233 p 1 in S 1 and S 2 . Meanwhile,p in S 4 approximates to its maximum value, namely, unity, att = 1.44. At last, we refer to the local epidemic spread, when intended velocities are\u1e7d 0 i = \u00b1\u1e7d 0 = \u00b15, 0, 0 . The number of pedestrians with the intended velocity v 0 , 0, 0 is same as that of pedestrians with \u2212v 0 , 0, 0 . The initial condition is quite same as that in Test A-1. Figure 22 shows contours ofp (upper-left frame),\u03c1 (upper-middle frame) and\u03b8 (upper-right frame), whent = 0.168, and contours ofp (lower-left frame),\u03c1 (lower-middle frame) and \u03b8 (lower-right frame), whent = 0.96. Certainly, the propagation speed of two characteristic infected domains, which correspond to S 1 and S 2 in the case of\u1e7d 0 = 1, increases in accordance with the increase in\u1e7d 0 , as shown in upper-left frame of Fig. 22 . Surely, two characteristic infected domains, which correspond to S 4 and S 4 in the case of\u1e7d 0 = 1, are obtained att = 0.96. Such an increase in the propagation speed in\u1ef8 -direction in accordance with the increase in\u1e7d 0 is explained by the fact that the increase in\u1e7d 0 yields the increase in the local temperature. For example,\u03b8 \u2208 [0.055, 0.095] is obtained, when\u1e7d 0 = 1 and t = 4.0, whereas\u03b8 \u2208 [0.83, 3.43] is obtained, when\u1e7d 0 = 5 andt = 0.96. The increase in the propagation speed of the boundary between the infected and uninfected domains in accordance with the increase in\u03b8 is surely confirmed in Fig. 13 . Finally, we confirm that small patterns in contours of\u03c1 and\u03b8 appear att = 0.168, whereas such small patterns in contours of\u03c1 and\u03b8 change to large patterns att = 0.96. The large patterns in contours of \u03c1 att = 0.96 are self-organized in accordance with the local dense and sparse populations of pedestrians. The large spatial-patterns of\u03c1 and\u03b8 att = 0.96 change, temporally, ast increases fromt = 0.96, whereas scales of the large patterns att = 0.96 are not enlarged, ast increases fromt = 0.96. We, however, find that pattern formations in contours of\u03c1 and \u03b8 never yield patterns in contours ofp att = 0.96.",
