To determine the role of proinflammatory cytokines in any observed anorexia, we measured concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in blood samples on d 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56. Regarding the interaction of cytokines, anorexia, and illness, we wrote (p. 215) \"Although we recorded temporal changes in TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in blood, these changes were unrelated to dietary treatment. . . There were no differences in proportion of calves refusing CMR or in the number of refusals recorded. Additionally, there were no effects of feeding regimen on concentrations of plasma TNF-\u03b1, suggesting that feeding method per se had no effect on anorexia or the calf's ability to use ingested nutrients.\"",

Further evaluation of our data (determined after publication) showed that calves voluntarily consumed 99.6, 99.4, and 99.4% of the CMR for calves fed fixed amount of CMR (CON), variable amount of CMR in an accelerated feeding program (VAR), or VAR plus dietary supplement (GAM) treatments, respectively.

It is understood that administration of CMR by esophageal feeder entails significant risk, but we determined that the practice was necessary to minimize variation in nutrient intake among calves during the study.

It should be noted that, in our study, calves were tubed with less CMR than that reported by Gentile et al. (2004) . In addition, in most cases (>53% of all instances), calves were administered CMR by esophageal feeder for 1 d only; thereafter, they consumed all CMR offered.",

For example, McGuirk and Ruegg (2001) stated \"Sick calves must be able to stay clean and dry. . . . Offer milk/milk replacer at the usual dilution and temperature but reduce volume (to 1 liter, for example) and feed more frequently (4 times/day, if needed).

However, Bartlett et al. (2006) and Cowles et al. (2006) reported no difference in fecal scores between groups of calves fed conventionally or in an accelerated feeding program. Khan et al.

Jasper and Weary (2002) reported no difference in \"diarrhea\" [defined as a score of 3 or 4 using the fecal scoring system of Larson et al. (1977) ] when calves were fed milk at 10% of BW or offered milk for ad libitum consumption. Conversely, Diaz et al. (2001) and Nonnecke et al. (2003) reported that calves fed accelerated feeding programs had higher fecal scores compared with calves fed conventionally. The data suggest that there is not necessarily an increase in fecal scores associated with accelerated CMR feeding programs, as was implied by the authors.",
