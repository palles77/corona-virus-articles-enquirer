However, there have been no reports on agents that have exhibited a therapeutic effect. Recently, chloroquine has been reported to antiviral effect. We investigated whether chloroquine can be used to treat FIP in vitro and in vivo. It was demonstrated that chloroquine has inhibitory effect against the replication of FIPV and anti-inflammatory effect in vitro. In vivo study using cats with experimentally induced FIP, the clinical score of chloroquine-treatment groups were better than in chloroquine-untreated group. However, alanine aminotransferase levels increased in the chloroquine-treated groups. It will be necessary to further investigate the possibility of FIP treatment with a combination of chloroquine and other agents.",

Lymphocyte and neutrophil counts in peripheral blood decreased in all cats on day 14 after FIPV inoculation (Table  2 ), but the level of this reduction was smaller in chloroquine-treated groups than in group C. Increases in total protein (TP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and direct bilirubin (D-Bil) levels were smaller in group A than in the other groups (Table 2) . On the other hand, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels increased in the chloroquine-treated groups. When the clinical condition of the cats in each group was evaluated using the Karnofsky score, the score was high in the chloroquine-treated groups ( Table 2 ). The mean number of survival days were 34.3, 31.7, and 21.0 in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Unfortunately, one animal in the group C died before the challenge of FIPV, statistical significance was not shown for any of the differences between 0.5 1 1.5",

In this study, chloroquine significantly inhibited inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression levels in FIPV-infected monocytes. The mechanism of inhibiting inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression by chloroquine is still unclear. Weber and Levitz (2000) suggested the presence of lysosomotropic and non-lysosomotropic mechanisms in the chloroquine-induced inhibition of TNF-a production. The former inhibits TNF-a release from cells and the latter inhibits TNF-a mRNA expression and transcription, which suggests that the significant inhibition of inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression levels by chloroquine in FIPV-infected monocytes involves the non-lysosomotropic mechanism. However, in a more recent paper by Jang et al. (2006) , it was shown that chloroquine does inhibit TNF-a release, but does not change the TNF-a mRNA levels or the synthesis of the TNF-a precursor. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. Furthermore, in addition to the lowering of TNF-a mRNA expression, the expression of IL-1b and IL-6 mRNA was decreased. Jang et al. (2006) reported that the stability of IL-1b and IL-6 mRNA was decreased by chloroquine. In the present study, the same mechanisms might decrease the expression of cytokine mRNA.",
