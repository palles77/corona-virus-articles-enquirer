Naturally occurring antibody to DEA 1 is not present. a. Transfusion of DEA 1-positive blood into a DEA 1-negative recipient will result in anti-DEA 1 alloantibody synthesis and shortened lifespan of the transfused erythrocytes. b. Subsequent transfusions mismatched at that allele will result in an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. C. DEA 3 and 5 are present in low incidence, and naturally occurring antibody to these antigens can occur (Swisher et al., 1962; Hale, 1995) . D. DEA 4 is a high-incidence antigen with no naturally occurring antibody. A hemolytic transfusion reaction has been described in a DEA 4-negative dog given repeated transfusions of DEA 4-positive blood (Melzer et al., 2003) . E. DEA 7 is a soluble nonerythroid antigen that is adsorbed onto the RBC surface (Bull et al., 1975) , and dogs that are negative for DEA 7 may have naturally occurring anti-DEA 7 alloantibodies (Bull, 1990; Hale, 1995) .",

Blood typing refers to identifying RBC blood group antigens by reacting RBCs with antibodies or other reagents in an agglutination or hemolytic assay. II. Crossmatching refers to detecting the presence of antierythrocyte antibodies occurring between the donor and the recipient. III. The rationale for blood typing and crossmatching is as follows:A. Avoid an immediate hemolytic transfusion reaction. B. Provide maximum survival of transfused cells by avoiding a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. C. Prevent sensitization of the recipient to future incompatible transfusions. D. Avoid sensitization of breeding females and subsequent hemolytic disease of neonates. IV. Blood typing is performed in both dogs and cats.A. Dogs 1. Canine donors are ideally DEA 1.1 and 1.2 negative. 2. If donors are typed as DEA 1.1 positive, blood is transfused only into recipients typed DEA 1.1 positive. 3. Antisera for typing is available from Midwest Animal",

This plasma contains the more stable clotting factors and can be used in cases of warfarin toxicity or hemophilia B. b. Cryoprecipitate-poor plasma and frozen plasma can be stored for up to 5 years. 3. Frozen plasma is plasma that has been frozen >6 hours after blood collection (e.g., removed from expired whole blood units), or FFP that has been stored >1 year. 4. Either FFP, cryoprecipitate-poor plasma, or frozen plasma may be used in cases of hypoproteinemia; however, synthetic colloids such as hetastarch are probably more effective in severe hypoproteinemias resulting from renal or intestinal protein loss. C. Platelets 1. Platelet-rich plasma or platelet concentrates may be used to stop or prevent hemorrhage in animals with thrombocytopenia or platelet function disorders. 2. Fresh whole blood may be substituted as a source of platelets when components are unavailable. 3. Platelet products must be stored at room temperature (no refrigeration) and their storage time is short-3 to 5 days with continuous agitation. 2. Give more rapidly in hypovolemic animals. 3. Give more slowly in animals with cardiac, hepatic, or renal failure (approximately 1 mL/kg/hr IV). B. Volume of whole blood or packed RBC to administer is calculated as follows: 1. Determine the PCV of the animal. 2. Volume (mL) of donor blood in anticoagulant to administer is calculated as follows:Animal weight (kg) \u03bc blood volume \u03bc (desired PCV \u2212 present PCV) PCV of donor blood in anticoagulant note: The blood volume in the dog is approximately 90 mL/kg; the volume in the cat is approximately 70 mL/kg. 3. Transfusion of 20 mL/kg of whole blood or 10 to 15 mL/kg of packed RBC raises the PCV of the recipient by 10%. C. FFP, frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate-poor plasma are given as follows:1. To thaw, place in a waterproof plastic bag and thaw at 37\u00b0 C. 2. Thawing at room temperature or in a refrigerator is avoided because cryoprecipitate will form. 3. Administer immediately on thawing, or store between 1\u00b0 and 6\u00b0 C. 4. Administer FFP within 24 hours of thawing if used as a source of labile coagulation factors. 5. Give at the rate of 5 to 10 mL/kg/hr IV. 6. Use 10 to 20 mL/kg of plasma to treat coagulation defi ciencies or hypoalbuminemia (note: Synthetic colloids may be preferred for increasing oncotic pressure in hypoalbuminemic cases). D. Administer platelet-rich plasma or platelet concentrate as follows: 1. Give at 5 to 10 mL/kg/hr IV. 2. Dosage is 1 unit (from 450 mL of blood)/10 kg to increase the platelet count by 20,000 to 40,000/mL. 3. Frozen canine platelets are available commercially. a. One unit of frozen platelets/10 kg increases the platelet count by approximately 20,000 platelets/mL. b. The product expires 6 months from the time of collection. E. Cryoprecipitate requires special handling.1. Thaw in a waterproof plastic bag at 37\u00b0 C; do not thaw in a refrigerator or at room temperature. 2. A bag of cryoprecipitate prepared from 200 mL of plasma contains approximately 100 to 150 units of vWf and factor VIII:C. 3. The product is administered at a dosage of 10 to 20 U/kg IV.
