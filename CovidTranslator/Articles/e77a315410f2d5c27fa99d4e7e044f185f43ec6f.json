In our study, legitimacy is categorized into market, relational, and social legitimacy, and the link between each type of legitimacy and acceptance is explored. We select the case of Alibaba and argue that Alibaba was especially competent in building legitimacy. Alibaba's continuous efforts to build legitimacy facilitated platform evolution despite its exposed weakness in intellectual property rights. These efforts rendered Alibaba as a de facto standard e-business model. This research suggests that any firm that wants market acceptance for its platform or e-commerce technology should focus more on building legitimacy among stakeholders than on anything else.",

Although there are variations across countries in regulations, societal norms, and business relationships, legitimacy building has been largely overlooked as a specific driver of industry development. In a similar vein of institutional theory, stakeholder theory assumes that a firm has a target stakeholder group for the intended behavior (Husted and Allen, 2006; Yang and Rivers, 2009 ). The leading platform firms in East Asia, such as Alibaba, GMarket, and Rakuten, are the central entities in the national e-commerce industry. Leveraging their positions in the industry, they have been creating different patterns of interactions within current institutional environments and thereby have benefitted from legitimacy successfully established in the environmental context. The buyers (consumers), sellers, suppliers, and government have been important in this context, as they are major stakeholders that affect the future growth of the ecommerce platform leaders.",

In this study, therefore, we focus on legitimacy building and examine its link to development of an ecommerce platform. Legitimacy is \"a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions\" (Suchman, 1995: 574) . Because a firm is a socio-economic entity, it feels pressure to gain legitimacy from stakeholders for its broad acceptance (Bergek et al., 2008) . Hence, it is reasonable to assume that firms in the e-commerce platform industry try to build legitimacy in the given institutional environment, which in turn facilitates political, technical, and social acceptance and, further, leads to industrial development.",

In order to address the questions, we choose the e-commerce platform business in China and conduct an exploratory study. This research setting attracts us particularly because, most of all, China is growing quickly and is now the largest e-commerce market, showing 120% of compounded annual growth during -2013 (McKinsey and Company, 2013 . The high market concentration ratio almost characterizes China as an oligopolistic structure for e-commerce. This fact subsequently leads to the question of how the market-leading firm has built legitimacy, that is, how the e-commerce platform firms have justified their presence to stakeholders or society. This issue is very important in the future of China's e-commerce industry because the industry is now rapidly experiencing a global transformation.",

Although there are alternative explanations, such as strategic or operational approaches, to explain China's e-commerce platform development (Martinsons, 2002) , we suggest a complementary, rather than a competitive, view of China's fast growth in the e-commerce platform industry. This remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the social legitimacy theory and conceptualize the model, and in Section 3, we explain the research method.

Legitimation goes through a social validation process that consists of the recognition of a distinctive competency possessed or role played by the organization in providing a good or service (Dacin et al., 2007) . The social validation process occurs differently for each firm, and, thus, the level of legitimacy differs among firms. Legitimacy is distinct from reputation, which is based on an emotional reaction (Fombrun, 1996: 37) , and it also differs from organizational prestige, which is a favorable public image regarding competencies (Perrow, 1961: 335) .",

Firms engage in organizational actions out of their motivations to be socially and normatively recognized by stakeholders, which include shareholders, customers, governments, suppliers, and alliance partners. Institutional theory has proposed that a firm's action cannot be detached from the social context because it creates inter-dependence with the stakeholders (Amburgey et al., 1996) . According to this view, even the most strategic choice is a deliberate attempt to create legitimacy in a society. Consequently, the institutional environment emerges as crucial, as it imposes pressure on firms to increase legitimacy by driving them into conforming to institutional rules, regulations, norms, and expectations (Dacin, 1997; Dacin et al., 2007; Scott, 1995) .",

When firms want to increase their presence in the market or enter a new business field, they need recognition in the market and from the important stakeholders. Researchers propose that market legitimacy is especially pertinent and de facto required when governmental authority over business is substantial and government endorsement is essential for existence in a particular market (Peng, 2000; Yiu and Makino, 2002) . For example, the Chinese government mandated a markettechnology swap policy as a condition for foreign firms' entrance in China and wanted multinational enterprises to contribute to the local technological capability. Although GM was a later entrant, it established a joint R&D institute with a local automobile manufacturer and successfully demonstrated market legitimacy to the Chinese government (Lee et al., 2012) .",

Constituents of the stakeholders vary, and key stakeholders differ depending upon the business context. However, what is common across contexts is to send all stakeholders a strong signal that the firm is worthy to do business with. The importance of perceived worthiness becomes even greater as globalization accelerates and increases the presence of international stakeholders in a firm's web of relationships (Bresser, 1988; Kanter, 1989) . Relational legitimacy helps firms overcome the liability of foreignness and enhances trust and reliability (Zaheer, 1995) . Inter-firm resources and expertise help deal with difficult situations, reduce risks, and enhance firm performance (Child and Faulkner, 1998) . Therefore, the need for relational legitimacy is essential for firms that have to deal with a large number of stakeholders. Relational legitimacy enables firms to obtain trust and reliability from stakeholders, and, by so doing, the firms can have a wider range of partner choices in relationship formation (Dacin et al., 2007) . For example, in the e-commerce industry, platform firms must deal with many sellers and buyers. The enhancement of relational legitimacy ensures buyer trust and, at the same time, can better attract qualified sellers.",

Although it is difficult to generalize across countries, existing studies suggest that the adoption of B2B (business-to-business) e-commerce shows the most visible differences between developing countries and developed countries because developing countries tend to lack the necessary financial, legal, and physical infrastructures for the development of e-commerce (Tan et al., 2007) . In order to continue industrial development, firms as well as technologies should be accepted by society. Platform firms in the e-commerce industry have to interact with consumers, sellers, regulators, technical partners, and shareholders. In the e-commerce system, trust is one of the fundamental requirements (Palvia, 2009) or determinants for the successful proliferation of online exchange relationships (Gefen, 2000) . Without trust, acceptance cannot follow; the consequent use of an underlying infrastructure and Internet application layer would be impossible, and e-commerce would not then grow (Martinez and Williams, 2010) .",

A disreputable company may exit the business and reenter with a different identity at a very low cost, with no perceptible break in activity (Oxley and Yeung, 2001) . Developing countries, most of which were not ready to prepare for technical incompleteness, had trouble with online acceptance and tried hard to increase the social trust. Accordingly, the development of e-commerce technologies is influenced by the technology-enabled efforts to complement the social trust. South Korea, for example, shared the problems of customer trust in online merchants in the early stage of e-commerce development (Jin et al., 2008) . There were fears that merchants might sell defective products, that merchants could be dishonest thieves, and that online payments cannot be recovered even if the product is not delivered. For another example, during the early stage of e-commerce, the Chinese government was either unwilling or unable to fully enforce many of the Internet and e-commerce regulations it instituted (Efendioglu and Yip, 2004) . Accordingly, 40% of the sellers using an online auction site were reported to pick a buyer in their hometown so that they could swap the goods for cash face-to-face but use the website for electronic advertisement and bidding.",

Instead, we have selected Alibaba as our case study for several reasons. First, Alibaba has witnessed the industrial evolution since the early stage of e-commerce. The firm, thus, is a valuable source to provide information about the industry's efforts toward legitimacy building over time. Second, although Alibaba shares approximately 50% of the e-commerce platform business (KPMG, 2014; McKinsey and Company, 2013) , its share rises to 90% of the business if including mobile commerce, another form of e-commerce in a broader sense. This fact sufficiently qualifies Alibaba as a key object to study in China's e-commerce industry. At the same time, it means that Alibaba's legitimacy has been essential in explaining its market success. Third, as Alibaba went to initial public offering in the overseas market, the firm is now being globalized. We also examine whether the increasing overseas sales have affected legitimacy building in the domestic market.",

As of the end of 2015, more than 12,000 village-level service centers have been opened in 20 provinces. These service centers have taken care of the logistics between counties and villages, rural marketing activities, and customer service communications. They have also assisted villagers with limited access to the Internet with the entire process of e-commerce, from product order, delivery, refund, and exchange as well as payment collection from selling local (rural) products.",

Once Alibaba designates a Taobao Village, rural farmers and sellers in the village can use the platform provided by Taobao at no charge. Alibaba marks a Taobao Village based on three criteria: \"businesses of the village should start from the use of Taobao platform,\" \"the annual transaction volumes should exceed 10 million RMB,\" and \"more than 10 percent households should be involved in the e-commerce or 100 active Taobao stores should be opened\" (Allizila, 2016) . By the end of 2015, Alibaba had promoted 780 Taobao Villages, which operate a distribution system across and within 17 provinces and had opened more than 200,000 online shops on the Taobao platform as a result of implementing this initiative.",

In the early 2000s, when the Internet penetration rate was very low, posting or promoting products online was far beyond the technical knowledge of rural residents in China. Alibaba continued to provide rural residents with online business solutions, including Alisoft, Aliloan, and Alimama. Alisoft is service platform software that instructs sellers on their business IT needs. Aliloan lends to sellers with good transaction histories and customer ratings at Alibaba. Small sellers, which usually have difficulty in accessing bank loans, have greatly benefited from Aliloan. Alimama enhances a seller's marketing capability. Combined with Alisoft and data services provided by Alibaba, sellers have been able to start businesses by following detailed steps guided by Alimama first to set up Taobao shops and then to organize, publish, and promote products. Alimama also offers instant communication tools to link buyers and sellers and teaches production promotion through online advertisement. Although Taobao also provides solution manuals for platform maneuvers, most rural sellers obtained necessary information from their acquaintances or the community members. These Ali-family additional solutions have eased the way of learning from peers, so that rural sellers on the Taobao platform have become adaptive to command new IT business skills.",

By so doing, sellers do not have to bear the storage, packaging, or delivery costs, all of which are burdened by Alibaba. Due to the under-developed infrastructure in China, supply chain building was difficult in the domestic market. Alibaba instead first experimented overseas and has operated Cainiao in the US, the EU, Japan, and Korea.

This research explains why some standards survive in the market and others do not when there are multiple standards in competition. The Alibaba experience clearly demonstrates that standards, even with government endorsement, should not condescend to the social aspects. Without acceptance in society, standardization would remain nothing but unnecessary state intervention.

Alibaba introduced Tmall, a typical open platform and the most representative online B2C business now. Jingdong (JD.com), another leading e-commerce firm in China, started its B2C business in 2004 and experienced exponential growth from 2007.

The business model of JD.com also integrated the entire value chain built under its control. In 2015, JD.com shared 22.9% of China's B2C market, leading others that operated with a closed business model",
