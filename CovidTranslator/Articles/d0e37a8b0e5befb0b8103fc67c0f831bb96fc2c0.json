The UK is home to over two million Muslims, who make up 4.8% of the overall population of England and Wales, 10 and these Muslims will visit Mecca and Medina in the KSA for religious purposes at least once in a lifetime. There are three main religious ceremonies or events that occur in KSA, 11 for which over 25 000 pilgrims from the UK travel to KSA each year: (1) the Hajj, which is the main obligatory pilgrimage and attracts up to three million pilgrims per year, (2) Umrah, which is a mini pilgrimage and is undertaken at any time during the year, and (3) Ramadan, the month of fasting. During these events, mass gatherings of pilgrims group together and simultaneously carry out the various religious rituals over a period of days or weeks. These mass gatherings are known to be associated with the transmission of a range of infectious diseases, with respiratory tract infections being exceedingly common. 11 Birmingham is the second largest city in the UK, and 21% of its population are Muslims. 10 The city also acts as a hub for travel to and from the Middle East from the surrounding areas. The regional public health laboratory situated in Birmingham provides a 7-day service. It is one of the few laboratories in the UK that has been responsible for enhanced surveillance covering the South West, the Midlands and the North of England, for returning travellers with severe respiratory symptoms that fit the clinical and epidemiological criteria of the Public Health England (PHE) MERS-CoV algorithm. 12 A detailed analysis of the results from this continued surveillance for MERS-CoV and other viral respiratory tract infections was conducted, which included the period over the three Hajj seasons of 2013, 2014, and 2015.",

This concurs with the wider global finding of no record of person-to-person transmission of MERS-CoV during the mass gatherings at the Hajj during the period 2013-15. 16 Since the diagnostic yield of MERS-CoV is dependent on the quality and type of respiratory tract sample, 17 MERS-CoV cases may have been missed. Furthermore, since MERS-CoV causes a wide clinical spectrum of presentations from mild to severe, 3 there is a possibility that returning pilgrims with MERS-CoV infection are being missed since they may recover without presenting to healthcare or may recover before a diagnosis is made. Thus the follow-up of patients to test for seroconversion and further epidemiological studies using serological tests 18 are necessary to establish whether any MERS CoV infections occur in pilgrims that we are unaware of.",

The viruses most frequently found were influenza A and rhinovirus, in approximately equal proportions. This is in contrast to some previous reports, which have indicated influenza A to be predominant. 19, 20 As befits the investigation of a LRT illness, the site of sampling appeared to have a bearing on the likelihood of a virus being detected: almost 60% of all positive results were obtained from LRT samples. Where patients had samples obtained from both the LRT and URT, and thus a direct comparison of results could be made, influenza A was more likely to be detected in LRT samples, whereas rhinovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza B were more likely in URT samples. This finding emphasizes the role played by influenza A in the development of pneumonia, and also the desirability of obtaining the most reliable specimen type to give an accurate diagnosis. This mirrors the optimal approach to the detection of MERS-CoV with the reported pronounced and prolonged shedding of virus from the LRT. 21 By extension, this frequency of detection of influenza A and B in patients suspected of having MERS-CoV infection also supports the use of empirical antiviral treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors pending the results of laboratory testing. Indeed, the use of antivirals should not be dependent on the prevailing likelihood of circulating influenza in the UK, since most travellers arrived back in the UK outside of the seasonal influenza activity period and most likely had acquired it following exposure to other Hajj pilgrims travelling from the Southern hemisphere.",

In particular, together with the above data implicating influenza A in the development of LRT infections, it is recommended that a documented history of influenza vaccination within the previous year is introduced as part of the pre-assessment of all Hajj pilgrims, in a similar fashion to the meningococcal vaccine pre-requisite.",

Even with these fluctuations in demand, it is imperative to maintain heightened awareness and enhanced surveillance with rapid detection of viral pathogens. 22 This should ensure that an outbreak due to MERS-CoV or other seasonal respiratory viruses, does not result from an undiagnosed returning traveller. MERS-CoV continues to spread within the Middle East and remains a global public health risk.
