The clinical classifications are as follows: (1) Mild: only mild symptoms, no sign of pneumonia in imaging. (2) Ordinary: with fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and imaging shows pneumonia. (3) Severe: meet any of the following: a) respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u2265 30 beats / min; b) in the resting state, means oxygen saturation \u2264 93%; c) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/ oxygen concentration 300mmHg (1mmHg = 0.133kPa). Pulmonary imaging showed that the lesions progressed more than 50% within 24-48 hours, and the patients were managed according to moderate case. (4) Critical: one of the following conditions: a) respiratory failure occurs and requires mechanical ventilation; b) Shock occurs; c) ICU admission is required for combined organ failure.
