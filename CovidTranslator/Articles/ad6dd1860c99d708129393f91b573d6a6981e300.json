Ribavirin is prescribed for chronic hepatitis C and is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in the male sexual partners of women who are pregnant. Both sexes are advised to avoid pregnancy for 6 months after exposure. The Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry was established in 2003 to monitor pregnancy exposures to ribavirin for signals of possible human teratogenicity. Methods This voluntary registry enrolls pregnant women with prenatal exposure to ribavirin. Exposure is classified as direct-women taking ribavirin during pregnancy or the 6 months prior to conception-or indirect-women exposed through sexual contact, 6 months prior to or during pregnancy, with a man who is taking or has taken ribavirin in the past 6 months. Women are followed until delivery and infants for 1 year. When enrollment is complete, birth defect rates will be compared with the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program's",

Of the 11 infants, nine had structural defects and two had chromosomal anomalies. Patterns suggesting a common etiology or relationship with ribavirin exposure are not seen. Conclusion Based on the patterns of birth defects reported, preliminary findings do not suggest a clear signal of human teratogenicity for ribavirin. However, the current sample size is insufficient for definitive conclusions, and ribavirin exposure should be avoided during pregnancy and during the 6 months prior to pregnancy, in accordance with prescribing information.

A second ribavirin product from Hoffman-La Roche, Copegus \u00d2 (ribavirin) [2] , was approved by the FDA in 2002 with a similar post-marketing commitment and a recommendation that Hoffman-La Roche and Schering Plough develop a joint pregnancy exposure registry for ribavirin to enroll from within the USA. In 2003, the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry was established. In subsequent years, five additional ribavirin manufacturers joined the registry as their products were approved for use in the USA.

However, for several of the 11 infants, an alternate origin may be etiologic. Two of the 11 infants with birth defects had chromosomal/genetic disorders (Table 4 , Case Numbers 2 and 10); therefore, it is unlikely that these conditions were related to ribavirin. Among the structural defects, two infants had a family history of the same defect, suggesting an inherited cause or predisposition. One of the infants with hypospadias had a paternal history of hypospadias (Table 4 , Case Number 8), and the infant with polydactyly (post-axial, right foot) and a neonatal tooth had a family history of both defects (Table 4 , Case Number 11). Of the two infants with torticollis (Table 4 , Case Numbers 6 and 9), one was reported as intermittent and, therefore, may be attributed to positioning in utero (Table 4 , Case Number 6) [37] . For the infant with 80% hearing loss (Table 4, Case Number 3) , there was no mention of this condition during the routine 1-year follow-up. This abnormality was first reported to the registry when the infant was 19 months of age, after participation in the registry was completed. The hearing loss was reported by the mother and was not confirmed by a healthcare provider. Hearing loss with a delayed onset is not characteristic of congenital deafness and suggests other prenatal factors (e.g., genetic diseases, congenital cytomegalovirus infection) or post-natal environmental factors, although none were reported. Finally, regarding the infant with secundum ASD (Table 4 , Case Number 5), the report was based on auscultation of a murmur at birth, and the registry was unable to obtain information on severity. However, the registry learned that at 7 months of age, the infant had a transthoracic echocardiogram, which indicated that the secundum ASD had resolved, and no additional cardiac abnormalities were found. The infant was included in the birth defect rate as a case, because the defect was present at birth, which is consistent with the handling of cases in the comparator population from MACDP [31] . The registry reports a variety of conditions among the 11 birth defect cases but has not detected patterns among subjects or similarities to the animal data [2, [10] [11] [12] suggestive of a teratogenic mechanism.",

Some birth defects may go unreported due to incomplete infant follow-up data; for example, some neurosensory or cardiac defects may not be observed by 1 year of age. Also, if the registry was unable to engage the pediatrician, birth defects that are typically identified later in infancy, which would have been captured in the 6-month or 1-year follow-up, may be underreported. Over-estimating the birth defect rate may have occurred due to the conservative approach used by the registry whose assessors are not blinded to the exposure when classifying birth defects. To avoid missing a potential signal, the registry classifies infants with birth defects as cases in the calculation of the direct and indirect birth defect rates when there may be a clear association with a genetic or environmental factor. In addition, the registry has a high lost to follow-up rate, which varies by the type of initial reporter (i.e., patient, healthcare provider, registry sponsor), and this limits the precision of estimated rates and the power of the comparison to MACDP.",

The variable representing congenital anomalies was a composite of all congenital anomalies reported in the secondary databases used in this study, and maternal medication use was not evaluated. The cohort dates (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) are prior to the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents for HCV in the USA in 2011. Therefore, it appears that prenatal ribavirin exposure during pregnancy cannot be ruled out in this population and, thus, this cohort may not be an unexposed population. Connell et al.

When this study was initiated, ribavirin was a relatively new medication with limited data on its use, particularly among pregnant women. Since that time, both the availability of secondary data for research (e.g., claims data, electronic health records data) and experience with ribavirin has increased. A study of this topic using a large secondary database that includes medication exposure may provide more data than a voluntary registry; however, this was not a feasible option in 2003. Nonetheless, secondary data on ribavirin use could provide an estimate of the extent of ribavirin use in the target population and thereby improve enrollment projections.",
