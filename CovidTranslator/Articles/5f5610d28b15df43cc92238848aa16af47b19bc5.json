This study aims to evaluate knowledge of IFT among emergency nurses of three Accident and Emergency Departments in Hong Kong. Methods: Questionnaires were distributed to registered nurses of the three departments. Data was sought on participants' characteristics, knowledge on equipment preparation and management of en route adverse events. Four clinical IFT scenarios were set for participants and answers were scored. Measured outcomes were defined as (1) relationships between clinical experience and relevant training in 1755-599X/$ -see front matter c",

Results: Participants' test scores ranged from 24 to 37 (out of 40) with a mean of 30.6 (95% confidence interval 29.7-31.5). Participants with more clinical experience demonstrated significantly better test scores (p < 0.05). Most participants were familiar with the monitoring devices carried in ambulances but were less familiar with the pharmacologic agents and airway devices available routinely in Hong Kong ambulances. Thirty participants (59%) had encountered en route adverse events in the past. Conclusion: Nurses in emergency departments in Hong Kong have good knowledge of IFT. Extensive clinical experience is related to better IFT knowledge. IFT training for nurses should emphasize available ambulance service resources and capabilities. c 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

            "text": "The role of inter-facility patient transport (IFT) is constantly being extended and expanded especially in smaller scale local hospitals in Hong Kong. This trend can be explained by three reasons. Firstly, there is ongoing centralization of specialist services to tertiary centers and this reorganization of services increases demand for IFT. Secondly, the difficult first hand experience of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis sensitized all healthcare staff to the importance of maintaining strict infection control measures. Strict infection control policies have led to declines in both patient turnover and the capacities of the wards. This clinical framework further aggravated existing bed constraints and a high quality IFT service became a must. In addition, IFT also plays a role in supplementing the primary trauma diversion program as trauma patients who have airway or breathing compromise that cannot be overcome at the scene or in transit require stabilization in the nearest hospital (Cheung et al., 2006) .",

Pre-transport preparation comprises patient stabilization (wherever possible), communication and documentation. This study showed that 65% (n = 33) of the participants had experienced physiological deteriorations during transport and referring facility therefore should attempt to stabilize the patient prior to dispatch as the presence of physiological instability is associated with greater risks of en route deterioration (Tan, 1997; Oakley, 1999; Uusaro et al., 2002) . However, the benefits of transport may outweigh the risks in some circumstances (for example, transfer to a vascular unit for surgery for ruptured aortic aneurysm) and this principle was essentially revealed by the guidelines written by American College of Critical Care Medicine Task Force (1993). A reliable communication system including physician-to-physician and/or nurse-to-nurse communication regarding patient's condition is also a fundamental principle of IFT (Tan, 1997; Warren et al., 2004) . Documentation is vital in IFT not only for the quality of the transport, but also to minimize potential medico-legal issues including informed consent, a written plan from attending doctors and an en route observation record (Maxwell and Miller, 1988) .",

Pre-transport assessment implies ensuring all equipments, intravenous lines, tubes and drains are secured and function properly as well as recording vital signs before dispatch. A multitude of equipment mishaps such as dislodged cannulae or loss of tubes can occur during IFT that is also demonstrated in this survey. Equipment support is a major component regarding preparatory work accountable by emergency nurses (Maxwell and Miller, 1988; Tan, 1997; Oakley, 1999; Barbara, 2003) . It can be classified into two parts -escort kits and on board equipments. Escort kits are usually pre-packed with minimum recommended devices (airway, monitoring and intravenous) and pharmacological agents (intravenous fluid and medication) (Warren et al., 2004) . As in this survey, the majority of participants felt that escort kits were over-equipped. The content of escort kits commonly overlap with ambulance equipment and a crowded kit may hinder personnel from accessing necessary equipment in a timely manner. The performance of the survey participants was suboptimal with respect to knowledge of drug availability on ambulances -only 33% of participants could state that adrenaline was routinely stocked in ambulances. A standardized ''vehicle equipment checklist'' and ''trauma kit equipment checklist'' prepared by Ambulance Command, Hong Kong Fire Service Department (1998) documents the equipment and drugs stored in each ambulance. Future training efforts for IFT in Hong Kong could include distributing these checklists to AED staff to improve awareness. Britto et al. (1995) , Etxebarria et al. (1998) and Blackwell (2002) identified equipment that is often brought on board after including devices for monitoring cardiac rhythm, blood pressure and oxygen saturation; ventilatory support (ventilator and capnometry); and cardiac support (defibrillator, pacing). They should be compact, robust, vibrationresistant, clearly visible and illuminated and have adequate battery power (Oakley, 1999) . Nearly two-thirds of participants reported equipment mishaps in this survey. Over a third of nurses experienced monitoring device failures and a fifth experienced venous access and endotracheal tube dislodgements during transport. Equipment checks and trouble-shooting should form part of the IFT curriculum for nurses in Hong Kong.",

It remains unclear as to whether a physician or nurse should be present during IFT. Configurations can be nurse-paramedic or physician-nurse combination (Oakley, 1999; Blackwell, 2002; Barbara, 2003) . Alternative personnel or specialized transport teams may be necessary depending on specific patient conditions (McGinn et al., 1996; Vos et al., 2004) . There is still no worldwide accepted standard for assigning accompanying personnel for IFT (Markakis et al., 2006) . In Hong Kong, training for IFT is not mandatory. This study did not show the significant relationship with training which is different from other studies (Tan, 1997; Blackwell, 2002; Uusaro et al., 2002) . Nevertheless, training is still to be recommended for frontline staff in order to enhance and enforce their skills in an unfamiliar prehospital environmentthe noisy, vibrating and bumpy ambulance (American College of Emergency Physicians, 1990; Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, 2003) .",
