Using integrated electronic health records data, we developed an automated search algorithm to identify SARI cases in a large cohort of critical care patients and evaluate patient outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all admissions to a medical intensive care unit from August 2009 through March 2016. Subsets were randomly selected for deriving and validating a search algorithm, which was compared with temporal trends in laboratory-confirmed influenza to ensure that SARI was correlated with influenza. The algorithm was applied to the cohort to identify clinical differences for patients with and without SARI. For identifying SARI, the algorithm (sensitivity, 86.9%; specificity, 95.6%) outperformed billing-based searching (sensitivity, 73.8%; specificity, 78.8%). Automated searching correlated with peaks in laboratory-confirmed influenza. Adjusted for severity of illness, SARI was associated with more hospital, intensive care unit and ventilator days but not with death or dismissal to home. The search algorithm accurately identified SARI for epidemiologic study and surveillance.",

A big-data approach is only as good as its inputs and thus its definitions and further consideration should be given as to whether the standing SARI definition is adequate for critical illness research and quality improvement. Despite the increase in ventilator use and length of stay, the ultimate end point of death was no different between SARI patients and non-SARI critically ill patients. This is a novel finding because most SARI mortality research to date has examined subsets of the SARI population, such as children and adults and human immunodeficiency virus-positive or negative patients [7] [8] [9] . Two studies reported high rates of mortality among SARI patients but did not compare them to a larger cohort [10, 11] . Another study by Sakr et al. [11] did find a correlation with SARI and mortality; however, those authors also identified several other independent risk factors that could aid risk stratification in an ICU.",

The patients with SARIs received comprehensive treatment and support in critical care settings and outcomes may be different if this approach were applied to a larger cohort of hospitalised patients. A more appropriate comparator among critically ill patients may be an age-and comorbidity-matched cohort of non-SARI patients. Nonetheless, if SARI activity does not correlate with mortality end points in the ICU, it may be worthwhile to consider a different definition for ICU outcomes which further differentiates the most severely [12] . This definition is more restrictive than the WHO surveillance definition of SARI, but it may be worth additional evaluation as a potential definition for identifying the most vulnerable, at-risk SARI patients and designing improved care process models. In our present study, we did not directly compare this definition with the WHO definition of SARI because of known issues with electronic surveillance and interrater reproducibility of radiographic findings well described in the ventilatorassociated-event literature [13] . This may be a topic for future studies. A limitation of our temporal correlation is a restriction of this analysis to patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Other SARIs most certainly contributed to the activity seen and may be responsible for much of the activity. However, as a disease with a well-documented and well-followed seasonality, it provides a good natural experiment and has been used in other studies to evaluate the utility of the SARI definition [14] .",

For example, a patient with SARI who requires ventilator care, vasopressors, or other organ support in the first 24 h after admission would likely be part of another tier of outcomes among the critically ill. For SARI to be the most useful for critical care research, the criteria probably need to be developed further beyond cough, fever, acuity, respiratory illness and hospital admission. A potential template for this may come from the European Adaptive Randomised Controlled Trial to Improve Survival in Hospitalised Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Infection. This ongoing study enrolls adult patients who are highly suspected of having community-acquired pneumonia according to at least two clinical criteria and radiologic confirmation and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation in the first 48 h",
