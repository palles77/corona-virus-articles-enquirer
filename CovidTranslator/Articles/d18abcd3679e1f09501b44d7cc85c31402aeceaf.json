Female mosquitoes ingest virus from the blood of an infected animal. On biting another animal the mosquito transfers the virus through saliva into the new host. Birds are the most common arbovirus hosts, whereas humans and other animals such as horses are usually dead-end hosts -they do not transmit the virus to others in the 'herd', and cannot function as a reservoir for reinfection of mosquitoes. Infection of dead-end hosts can, however, lead to clinical disease (TABLE 1) . In this review, we focus on selected viruses such as Venezuelan equine and Japanese encephalitis viruses (VEEV and JEV, respectively), which cause epidemics by adapting to domestic animals and exploiting them as amplification hosts. We discuss other mosquito-borne viruses including West Nile virus (WNV) and DENV, which cause neurological disease. We consider the patterns and history of host-and geographical-range alterations that lead to disease emergence, and the experimental model systems that are used to study the evolutionary constraints on arbovirus host-range changes.",

VEEV was isolated in 1938 from a post-mortem brain specimen of a horse with encephalitis 9,10 , but it was only in the late 1950s that the VEEV was identified as a cause of human diseasepresenting as a febrile illness, sometimes accompanied by neurological manifestations and occasional mortality 11, 12 . Until 1995, periodic but unpredictable outbreaks of VEE (some involving hundreds of thousands of equine and human cases) were mostly restricted to as well as in Mexico and Florida. These ENZOOTIC strains differed from the strains that were isolated during equine epizootics and epidemics; they were antigenically distinct and generated little or no viraemia in experimentally infected horses. It was therefore thought that enzootic strains were incapable of causing epidemics, although fatal infections documented in Panama and Mexico established their virulence as human pathogens 18, 19 . In the late 1960s, antigenic studies shed light on the relationship between epizootic and enzootic VEEV strains. The strains isolated during major epizootics were antigenically similar, and were classified into SUBTYPES IAB and IC. The enzootic strains were antigenically distinct from the epizootic strains and were more diverse. The enzootic strains were grouped into subtypes ID-IF and II-VI, and were later classified as several different species 12, 20 (TABLE 2) . As it was initially believed that enzootic VEEV strains were unrelated to VEE outbreaks, because they were incapable of amplification in equines and were never isolated during major epidemics, the source of the subtype IAB and IC strains that initiated VEE epizootics and epidemics remained unknown 19 .",

Initially, RNA oligonucleotide fingerprinting showed that some enzootic strains in subtype ID were more closely related to certain subtype IC epizootic strains than was indicated by their antigenic properties 21 . Later, genome sequencing confirmed Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia (FIG. 1) . (Human cases were only recognized retrospectively for the earliest outbreaks.) Widespread and long-lasting VEE outbreaks did occur -one EPIZOOTIC began in El Salvador and Guatemala in 1969 and spread through most of Central America and Mexico, reaching Texas in the United States in 1971. However, after 1973, VEE outbreaks and epizootic STRAINS seemed to disappear for 19 years. There were many reasons for this long period of viral inactivity. Equine encephalitis has a high mortality rate, and those animals that survive usually produce protective neutralizing antibodies and are immune to reinfection 13, 14 . Insufficient populations of mosquito vectors also limited incidence of the disease. However, in 1992, an outbreak of VEE occurred in Venezuela (1992-1993 Venezuelan epizootic/epidemic) 15 , and in 1995, there were epizootics/epidemics in Venezuela and Colombia 16 , as well as small equine epizootics in southern Mexico in 1993 and 1996 (REF. 17) .",

Preliminary studies in which these mutations were introduced into the envelope protein of an enzootic ID strain indicate that an Arg or Lys residue at amino-acid position 213 is the main determinant of the equine viraemia phenotype. Interestingly, these mutations also change the serotype from ID to IAB/IC, explaining the correlation between VEEV serotype and epizootic potential. This single amino-acid substitution, which has a major effect on the vertebrate host range, has resulted in the repeated occurrence of VEE emergence over the past 75 years. This period correlates with the introduction of equines into the New World from Europe, and the establishment of equine populations that are large enough to mediate efficient amplification. RNA viruses, including alphaviruses, have very high mutation frequencies because their error-prone RNAdependent RNA polymerases lack proof-reading ability 28 . Estimates of mutation frequency for a closely related alphavirus, eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), are approximately 10 -4 substitutions per nucleotide. This indicates that the single mutation leading to the Lys or Arg substitution at position 213 in the envelope glycoprotein E2 occurs regularly in nature, because VEEV populations in mosquitoes and vertebrate reservoir hosts usually exceed 10 4 plaque-forming units (pfu) ml -1 . An interesting exception to the association between equine VEEV amplification and epizootic transmission is the recent mechanism of equine disease emergence in Mexico 17 . Although phylogenetic studies support the recent acquisition of the equine virulence phenotype by local, enzootic subtype IE strains 27, 29 , the link between neuroinvasion and viraemia -which occurs in all other epizootic strains (subtypes IAB and IC)is broken in the Mexican strains isolated from encephalitic horses in 1993 and 1996. These VEEV strains cause equine encephalitis in the absence of high-titre viraemia, which indicates increased neurotropism, as high plasma levels of circulating VEEV are usually necessary for cerebral invasion 30 . The lack of equine amplification by these strains probably explains their failure to spread to the United States and Central America, despite similar ecological conditions and a geographical position in the path of the widespread 1969-1971 subtype IAB outbreak. Other epizootic amplification hosts are being sought in Mexico to explain the sudden emergence of VEE in 1993, but selection by deforestation for adaption to an alternative, non-sylvatic vector may also be involved 31 . this similarity 22 . Phylogenetic studies concluded that the enzootic subtype ID strains were ancestors of the epizootic viruses -now known to have evolved independently on at least three occasions (FIG. 2) . This led to the prediction, in 1992, that additional epizootics would follow despite a 19-year hiatus 23 . In the case of the 1992-1993 Venezuelan outbreak, and both Mexican outbreaks, phylogenetic studies identified SYMPATRIC, closely related enzootic strains that seemed to represent the epizootic progenitors. The 1995 Venezuelan/ Colombian isolates were almost identical to strains isolated in the same regions during a 1962-1964 epizootic/epidemic, suggesting either release from a laboratory source or unprecedented genetic stability in a cryptic, natural transmission cycle 24 .",

Why has only one of the closely related enzootic VEEV lineages (FIG. 2) apparently generated all epizootic IAB and IC strains responsible for major outbreaks? Do slight differences in the gene and protein profiles of other enzootic VEEV lineages prevent adaptation to equine hosts and/or epizootic vectors by altering the effect of minor genetic mutations? As equine populations decline in Latin America, and human and domestic animal populations increase, will the scale and frequency of VEE epizootics decrease? Can humans or domestic animals such as cattle replace equines as amplification hosts? Humans can sustain levels of viraemia similar to those of equines, but are probably Mosquito host range and emergence. As well as adaptation to equine amplification,VEEV emergence from enzootic progenitors requires an alteration in the mosquitovector host range. All seven of the vector species identified in enzootic VEEV cycles are members of the Culex (Melanoconion) subgenus of mosquitoes, and all of these mosquitoes are also members of the Spissipes section (comprising 23 species) of this subgenus 32 . The ecological and physiological properties that facilitate efficient transmission of enzootic VEEV by these mosquitoes are unknown, but might include their relative population stability, as they inhabit areas around permanent water sources. However, during outbreaks, floodwater mosquitoes of genera such as Ochlerotatus (formerly named Aedes) and Psorophora -which show large seasonal changes in population density -are the main transmission vectors of epizootic VEEV. Outbreaks often occur in desert-like habitats -such as the Guajira Peninsula of Venezuela and Colombia -at times of unusually heavy rain. Similar climatic events might contribute to the emergence of other arboviruses such as Rift Valley fever virus, which, unlike VEEV, is efficiently maintained by transovarial transmission 33 . Studies showing that Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus (probably the most important epizootic vector in coastal outbreaks) has a higher oral susceptibility to epizootic (subtype IAB) compared with enzootic (subtype IE) VEEV ZOONOTIC Pathogens or diseases that normally circulate among nonhuman animals but that can be transmitted to humans. figure) . VEEV adaptation to domestic amplification hosts (equines) requires mutations in the E2 gene that encodes the envelope glycoprotein. These mutations increase the level of host viraemia, and have occurred at least three times during the past century. This change is accompanied by an alteration in the VEEV serotype to IAB or IC. Adaptation to epizootic mosquito vectors also seems to accompany some VEEV outbreaks. Dengue viruses have emerged as the most important human arboviral pathogens by altering their host range, from non-human primate enzootic reservoirs to humans, in an ecologically and separately evolving urban endemic transmission cycle (see figure) . The four dengue serotypes all emerged independently as human pathogens hundreds to thousands of years ago, when human populations had attained sufficient density to enable continuous horizontal transmission, probably supplemented by vertical transmission in mosquitoes.",

Cattle, dogs and other domestic animals are susceptible to infection with VEEV, but levels of viraemias are low, and adaptation would probably be required for amplification in these hosts. During 1995, epidemic VEE occurred in regions of Venezuela lacking equine populations, but with abundant goats, sheep and people, implicating humans or other animals as amplification hosts (G. Medina and N. Perez, personal communication). Can epizootic VEEV strains persist in nature in the absence of efficient equine amplification and transmission? Is epizootic adaptation to equine and mosquito hosts species-specific, resulting in a loss of fitness for the sylvatic hosts that are required for permanent viral circulation? Further research is needed to predict the future impact of VEE, and to design effective measures to prevent and control natural emergence events and possible terrorist introductions.",

            "text": "There are other interesting questions about EEEV and western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV). Unlike VEEV, these viruses do not amplify efficiently in equines (they produce low levels of viraemia), and epizootics involve avian hosts and usually occur only in close proximity to their enzootic swamp (EEEV) 37 or agricultural the level of viraemia is too low to infect mosquitoes. Similarly, an unusually wide range of animals, including birds, dogs, bats and snakes are dead-end hosts that are unable to infect mosquitoes. Pigs and birds are the major amplifying hosts of JEV, although infection usually does not produce clinical disease. These animals do, however, develop high-titre viraemias, which provide an excellent source of infection for mosquitoes. In parts of Asia where pigs are often kept adjacent to human dwellings, these animals are an important source of viral amplification and significantly enhance human exposure and infection. Also, as most domestic pigs are slaughtered by 16 months of age, annual birth cohorts provide a population of animals that are susceptible to infection 42 . As JEV does occur in areas of Asia where pig populations are low, they are not essential hosts for the enzootic transmission cycle. Interestingly, in central Java, where there are few pigs, it seems that cattle, which are normally considered a dead-end host, might be involved in the natural transmission cycle of JEV 43 . Migratory birds allow JEV to travel large distances. Unlike VEEV, there case of encephalitis 41 . JEV is the largest worldwide cause of epidemic encephalitis. The virus causes epidemics of paediatric encephalitis, mainly in India, Korea, China, south-east Asia and Indonesia. Owing to its large geographical range, more than two billion people are at risk of infection, and case-fatality rates often exceed 20%. Approximately 50,000 cases occur each year, of which 15,000 are fatal; importantly, up to 50% of those who survive the disease suffer from neurological sequelae that last from months to years. The ratio of apparent to inapparent (asymptomatic) infection varies from 1 in 50 to 1 in 400, depending on the geographical area. For example, in northern Thailand, cases of encephalitis caused by JEV have been diagnosed each year since the late 1960s, with most cases occurring during the rainy season in June, July and August. The fatality rate of virologically confirmed cases is 33%, and, in Thailand, about 1 in 300 humans that are infected with JEV develop encephalitis.",

The relevance to human disease of the genotypic and antigenic differences among JEV strains is unknown. Early genetic studies used RNA oligonucleotide fingerprinting to identify genetic differences; however, determination of the nucleotide sequence of the first JEV genome in 1987 (strain JaOArs892, genotype III) 47 facilitated comprehensive genetic studies. Representative genomic sequences of the four genotypes have been determined, and results are consistent irrespective of the technique used (T1 mapping, partial or complete genome sequencing). The genotypes show different levels of geographical clustering (FIG. 3) . Genotype I is found in Australia, Japan, Korea, northern Thailand and Cambodia; genotype II is found in Australia, southern Thailand, Malaysia, Sarawak and Indonesia; genotype III is found throughout Asia and genotype IV is found only in Indonesia. Initial studies suggested that there were genetic differences between strains associated with endemic (round the year) disease in tropical regions of Asia such as Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, compared with epidemic (summer-only) disease in temperate regions of Asia (for example, Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China). However, this has not been confirmed, and differences in endemic and epidemic disease are probably due to climatic variation. JE is an emerging disease, and its geographical distribution is increasing. Australia is the latest country in which JEV has been isolated, and the virus was probably introduced by viraemic migratory birds or wind-borne infected mosquitoes.",

The phylogeny of JEV (FIG. 3) indicates that genotype IV, which is found only in Indonesia, is ancestral. Genotypes II and III have also been found, sometimes concurrently, in the Indonesia/Malaysia region. Introduction of JEV into Badu Island in the Torres Straits, Australia, in 1995 involved genotype II, whereas the subsequent introduction of JEV into northern Australia in 1998 involved genotype I. Genotype III is most commonly isolated, and is found throughout Asia (but not Australia). Similarly, genotype III was the only genotype found in Japan until 1998, when genotype I was first isolated.

Studies have indicated that there are antigenic and genetic differences among JEV strains, with at least four genotypes and five antigenic subtypes [44] [45] [46] . These genotypes and subtypes might correspond, although this has not been experimentally proteins (part a in figure) . During infection, two mRNAs are synthesized -a full length mRNA that forms the viral genome and a smaller mRNA that is used to produce virion (part b, right) shows the RNA genome in the centre surrounded by 240 copies of the capsid protein, and the lipid-bilayer envelope, which is derived from the host-cell plasma membrane. The capsid protein is arranged into hexons and pentons on a T = 4 lattice, which complements the organization of the envelope glycoproteins. The E1 envelope glycoproteins are parallel to the envelope and the E2 envelope glycoproteins form spikes on the surface. The E2 protein is believed to be the site of mutations that alter the host range of VEEV for equines and mosquitoes to mediate epizootic emergence, probably through cellular-receptor interactions. The nucleocapsid (part c) has capsid proteins arranged with T = 4 icosahedral symmetry. The figure was reproduced with permission from REF 49 . It is thought that migratory birds might be important in the emergence of JEV. The Asiatic cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis coromandus) is an important amplifying host, and its geographical range increased in Asia during the nineteenth century because of changes in agricultural practices 50 . This coincided with the evolution and spread of recent JEV genotypes. It is also tempting to hypothesize that the Second World War had an important role in JEV emergence, because isolation of JEV strains had been restricted to Japan prior to this conflict. Some important questions remain. Why is genotype IV restricted to the Indonesian/Malaysian region, whereas recent genotypes are geographically more widespread? Genotype IV has only been identified once (in 1981), from five mosquito isolates, and its ability to cause human disease is unproven. Although it is thought that genotype IV existed prior to 1981, this has not been confirmed. The sequence of the structural protein genes of a 1952 strain (Muar) from Malaysia 51 indicates that Muar is ancestral to genotype IV and is a fifth genotype (FIG. 3b) source of the virus, because humans only develop a low-titre viraemia and are therefore considered deadend hosts. Bioterrorism is also an unlikely source, as the epicentre of the 1999 outbreak was in the Queen's district of New York City, and the virus was transmitted by mosquitoes. One explanation is that WNV was introduced to New York by a viraemic animal that was subsequently bitten by a mosquito, which then spread the disease to humans. Many exotic animal species, particularly birds, are imported into the United States through New York, and it is possible that an imported viraemic bird initiated transmission. Alternatively, an infected migratory bird might have carried the virus to the United States. Normally, migratory birds fly in a north-south direction, rather than in an east-west direction. The north-south route would imply that the virus entered the United States from Central/South America. This seems unlikely, as WNV was only found in the southern United States at least one year after it was discovered in New York. Another possibility is the east-west route. Although this might also seem unlikely, vagrant racing-pigeons from Europe occasionally appear in the United States. Recently, the UK media reported that a homing pigeon called 'Billy' was released in France en route to Britain, but instead flew to New York 58 . Finally, an infected mosquito that was transported aboard an aircraft could have introduced WNV to the United States. Aircraft departing from the Middle East to the United States are not routinely treated with insecticide, and mosquitoes often enter aeroplanes -attracted by humans or bright light. ",

This conclusion was supported by serological studies that showed a lack of anti-WNV antibodies in individuals living in New York prior to 1999 (REF. 54 ). Initial studies revealed that the nucleotide sequences of strains found on the eastern seaboard of the United States were similar to the prototype 'New York 1999' (NY99) strain isolated from a flamingo in the Bronx Zoo, and indicated that the NY99 strain spread westward in 2000-2002. Recent studies have shown that a genetic variant termed 'North America' has arisen since 2001 and has replaced NY99 as the dominant genotype present in North America 56 . The 'North America' genotype only differs by 0.18% from NY99, but has characteristic nucleotide and amino-acid substitutions. Other genetic variants have been identified, including a south-east coastal Texas genotype that differs by 0.27% from NY99 and by 0.55% from 'North America', and a Mexican genotype that differs by 0.45% from NY99 (REF. 57 ). Overall, these data might indicate a lack of Darwinian selection in the evolution of a particular genetic variant, and support genetic drift of the virus during its dissemination across North America. Consistent with this hypothesis, the southeast coastal Texas genotype was only isolated in 2002 from the Texas-Louisiana border, and might have become extinct. To date, there is no evidence for selection of any phenotypic differences among North American strains, and it remains to be seen if WNV will evolve towards reduced virulence as it adapts to new hosts in the western-hemisphere ecosystem.",

In urban settings, DENVs are transmitted among human hosts by the PERIDOMESTIC mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. However, studies of dengue virus ecology in sylvatic habitats of west Africa 72 and Malaysia 73, 74 have identified transmission cycles involving non-human primates as reservoir hosts and arboreal, tree-hole dwelling Aedes (Stegomyia) spp. as vectors. Efficient inter-human DENV transmission probably requires a human population of 10,000 to 1 million people, a feature of urban civilizations that did not exist until about 4,000 years ago, and therefore the sylvatic cycle is probably ancestral 75 . Endemic/epidemic DENV is therefore thought to have evolved in Africa or Asia from sylvatic viral forms. Initial phylogenetic studies of both endemic/ epidemic and sylvatic strains of DENV-2 showed evolutionary divergence of these ecologically distinct forms 76 .",

The highly efficient peridomestic transmission cycle -which is now independent of the ancestral sylvatic cycles -benefits greatly from the ecology of A. aegypti. This species lays its eggs in waterstorage containers and in refuse, it readily enters human habitations and it often takes several blood meals during each reproductive cycle for both egg production and nutrition. Once infected, this competent vector transmits the virus to many human hosts 78, 79 . Interestingly, as with sylvatic DENV, A. aegypti originated from another tree-hole-dwelling Aedes mosquito which is found in sylvatic African habitats (Aedes aegypti formosus) 80 . However, the sylvatic African forms of DENV do not use A. aegypti formosus as a principal vector, and this subspecies is relatively refractory to infection 81 . Yellow fever virus also uses A. aegypti aegypti as its main vector during African urban epidemics, but this cycle seems to be temporary and cannot be detected during inter-epidemic periods. It is not known why YFV has not adapted to a permanent human-A. aegypti endemic cycle, which would have devastating public health implications.",

There are two main hypotheses based on comparisons with other members of the JEV group members. First, WNV could become enzootic and endemic, similar to St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), and cause limited human disease through spillover. Alternatively, the virus could become epidemic, similar to Asian strains of JEV, and could cause annual outbreaks affecting large numbers of humans and animals. The 'explosive' nature of the North-American WNV epidemic as well as the equine and avian epizootics might reflect highly efficient enzootic amplification and avian virulence. North-American birds have probably not developed resistance to WNV because of low levels of viral exposure. Virulence in the avian host might subsequently decline because of the strong selection for resistance to WNV resulting from high bird-mortality rates. If resistance is accompanied by a decline in viraemia levels, enzootic amplification could subside. Then, spillover to humans and equines would diminish. The transport of WNV into Latin America by migratory birds raises important questions about pre-existing human and avian immunity to other flaviviruses such as SLEV, DENV, YFV and Rocio virus. Cross-reactive immunity could protect against WNV infection and/or disease, or could increase pathogenesis through immune enhancement, which is thought to contribute to the aetiology of dengue hemorrhagic fever. It is still not known if WNV and South American flaviviruses can share the same hosts and ecosystems (similar to WNV and SLEV in the United States). It is also not known how WNV will spread and cause human disease in the presence of flavivirus antibodies.",

Another arbovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), can also adapt simultaneously to sandfly and vertebrate host cells, and the mutation rate of the virus in specialized compared to alternating-host passages is the same. This contradicts the hypothesis that arboviruses are constrained in their evolutionary potential 87 . Surprisingly, VSV populations that are specialized for replication in vertebrate cells showed fitnessincreases for replication in sandfly cells, indicating a lack of specificity in some adaptation events. Further study of these model systems is needed to determine if alternating passages generate mutations that increase fitness in both cell types, or if they generate a polymorphic population with host-cell-specific adaptive mutations. Recent in vivo experiments have produced results that contradict the cell-culture experimental models of arbovirus evolution. When VEEV was placed into a laboratory transmission cycle -consisting of ten cycles in hamsters alternating with ten cycles in A. aegypti mosquitoes -genetic stability of the virus isolates was observed, and virus fitness was either reduced or unchanged. However, specialization for replication in the hamster host resulted in rapid increases in virus fitness with many mutations, consistent with virus adaptation and evolutionary constraints imposed by the alternating-host cycle of arboviruses 88 .

Viruses that have obligate alternating replication cycles in taxonomically disparate hosts -vertebrate and arthropod -should be compromised because they are 'generalists', owing to their fitness in both hosts. Other viruses that use a single host as their main reservoir might be able to adapt more readily to related hosts. This might account for the slow rates of evolution of most arboviruses (approximately 10 4 substitutions per nucleotide per year) compared with many single-host RNA viruses (approximately 10 2 -10 3 substitutions per nucleotide per year) 84 . Experimental cell-culture model systems have been developed to test this hypothesis, but results are only partially supportive. In vitro transmission cycles of EEEV have been established by serial passage in vertebrate (baby-hamster kidney), or mosquito (A. albopictus C6/36) cells 85 . EEEV has also been introduced into an alternating-host cycle of both cell types to mimic the natural transmission cycle. As predicted, virus-fitness increases occurred in both hosts following specialization. Viruses that had specialized to one host type showed a decline in fitness in the alternate cells, as well as in comparable vertebrate or mosquito cells, consistent with specificity of adaptation during specialization. Surprisingly, the alternating-host-cell cycles resulted in simultaneous adaptation to both cell lines, with increased levels of fitness comparable to those associated with host specialization, contradicting the hypothesis that arboviruses are limited in their adaptation potential by the alternating-host transmission cycle. However, specialization resulted in a larger number of mutations than alternating-host passages, consistent with the reduced rates of nucleotide-sequence changes typical of arboviruses.

Furthermore, none of approximately 300 JEV sequences are closely related to strain Muar, indicating that this lineage might be extinct. The isolation of strain Muar from a human might indicate that all JEV strains, including genotype IV, can cause human disease.",
