For centuries, the herb has been employed in clinical practice for treatment of virus infection and inflammation. However, its active ingredients remain unclear. Aim of the study: In the present study, the anti-influenza virus activity of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, the Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products, was firstly evaluated in vitro and in ovo and their mechanism of action was investigated. Materials and methods: Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were isolated from Isatidis Radix by chiral separation. In vitro and in ovo evaluations were performed on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and embryonated eggs respectively, both using protocols including prevention, treatment and virus neutralization. Hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays were performed for further understanding of the antiviral mechanism. Results: Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products all exhibited dose-dependent inhibition effect against influenza A virus (H1N1) without toxicity. The antiviral potency of the components was in the order of progoitrin > goitrin > epigoitrin > epiprogoitrin. The attachment of the constituents to the viral envelope conduced to the mechanism of their antiviral action without disturbing viral adsorption or budding. Conclusion: Taken together, these results are promising for further development of Isatidis Radix and may contribute an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for influenza virus infection.",

Annually, influenza epidemics lead to 200-500,000 fatal cases globally (Courtin et al., 2017) . Currently, therapeutic strategies to lower the mortality rates mainly rely on vaccines and chemical drugs. But usage of vaccines has been often challenged by frequent mutation of the antigen and narrow spectrum (Tao et al., 2017; Zarubaev et al., 2015) . On the other side, viral resistance and adverse effects restrict the clinic application of currently available anti-influenza virus drugs including neuraminidase inhibitors, M2 channel blockers and RNA synthesis inhibitors (Hayden and De Jong, 2011; Samson et al., 2013; Correia et al., 2015) . Hence, alternative drugs with low toxicity, broad spectrum and less resistance remain to be developed.",

Among them, Isatidis Radix (\"Ban-Lan-Gen\" in Chinese, the sun-dried root of Isatis indigotica Fortune ex Lindl.) is well-known for its antiviral activity. In ethnic medical practice, Isatidis Radix has been prescribed for treating fever, pestilence, sore throat, seasonal toxin, papule caused by warm toxin, macula, scarlatina, mumps, swelling abscess, erysipelas and erysipelas facialis (Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2015) . As officially approved medicinal material and products in China, Isatidis Radix and its formulations have been used as the major herbal remedies in prevention and treatment against a wide range of viral infections, (Lin et al., 2005; Deng et al., 2013) . Regardless of the various subtypes of viruses and their rapid mutations, Isatidis Radix was found to be effective in clinic against infections caused by influenza viruses with different strains and subtypes (Ke et al., 2012) . Notwithstanding the anti-influenza efficacy of Isatidis Radix and its preparations is well acknowledged, their active constituents and pharmacological actions have not been elucidated. So far, a few antiviral components have been identified in Isatidis Radix, including (3H)-quinazolinone , glycoprotein (Yamada, 1999) , epigoitrin, 2,4(1H, 3H)-quinazolinedione (Xu et al., 2005) , indirubin (Mak et al., 2004) , fructopyrano-(1 \u2192 4)-glucopyranose (Zhang et al., 2013) , clemastanin B , lariciresinol-4-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (Li et al., 2015) , polysaccharides (Li et al., 2017) , isatithioetherin B and isatithioetherin D (Guo et al., 2018) . Among these, the antiviral monomer epigoitrin has received much attention and it was chosen as the marker of antiviral efficacy in Isatidis Radix when drafting the 2010 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.",

Consequently, the assay marker for Isatidis Radix was changed to (R, S)-goitrin in 2010 and 2015 editions of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. In addition, (R, S)-goitrin was first resolved by the authors (Nie et al., 2010) using normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC). Later, novel supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed for high-throughput chiral separation and stereospecific assay, respectively (Nie et al., 2016 (Nie et al., , 2017 . On the other hand, epigoitrin and goitrin were verified as breakdown products of their glucosinolate prototypes, epiprogoitrin ((R)-hydroxy-3-butenylglucosinolate) and progoitrin ((S)-hydroxy-3-butenylglucosinolate), on the effect of myrosinase ( Fig. 1 ) (Nie et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2011) . As well as being isomers, pure enantiomeric forms of epiprogoitrin and progoitrin were extracted and resolved by the authors from Isatidis Radix. In spite of the chemical structures and the biotransformation of the glucosinolates and their breakdown products are illuminated (Xie et al., 2011) , the antiviral activity of the monomers and their mode of action remain elusive.",

The scientific name of the plant has been checked with http://www. theplantlist.org on 26, August 2019. The plant material, grown in good agricultural practice (GAP) base in Yutian, He-Bei Province, was obtained from Beijing Tongrentang Co., Ltd. The origin was authenticated by Associate Professor Shuai Kang, Curator of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbarium of National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, using macroscopic and microscopic analysis according to the Chinese pharmacopoeia (Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2015) . For future reference, its specimen (No. B-1) was deposited at the Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbarium, National Institutes of Food and Drug Control (Beijing, PR China). Epiprogoitrin and progoitrin were extracted and isolated form Isatidis Radix based on a similar strategy from a previous report (Xie et al., 2011) . First, the pulverized Isatidis Radix was extracted with methanol; then the extraction was deproteinized with ammonium acetate and purified with granular activated carbon to obtain the crude extracts of glucosinolates; and, finally, epiprogoitrin and progoitrin were separated from the crude extracts by preparative ion-pair chromatography. Epigoitrin and goitrin were separated from (R, S)-goitrin reference standard (National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Lot No. 111753-201706) by SFC chiral resolution on a Chiralpak IC column with acetonitrile and carbon dioxide as the mobile phase (Nie et al., 2016) . The structures of the purified compound were confirmed by 1 H and 13 C NMR (Bruker DRX-500), MS (Waters SYNAPT G2) and optical rotation (Rudolph Autopol IV). The purities of the prepared compounds were all determined to be > 98% by HPLC (Xie et al., 2011) and chiral SFC (Nie et al., 2016) methods. Contents of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin in the plant material were determined to be 0.19%, 0.10%, 0.10% and 0.05% respectively by HPLC methods (Nie et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2011) . Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted with sodium chloride injection to get test solutions at concentrations. The solutions were kept at 4\u00b0C in a sterilized container.",

First, CPE inhibition assays were designed in three different ways to examine their inhibitory effect against influenza virus strain A/ California/7/2009 (H1N1) in vitro, and to determine at which stage they act in the viral replication cycle. The results indicated that the antiviral activity of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin was mainly attributed to their virucidal effect, but not action on host cell protection or post-virus-adsorption interruption. Virus, rather than cell, was more probably to be the action target of the components. Hence, further insight into the antiviral activity in ovo was performed by hemagglutination test on the allantoic fluid of embryonated eggs. In agreement with previous observations, the four components were all found to significantly reduce viral titer in chicken embryos when mixed with virus before infection. Taken together, it was concluded that epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin showed obvious virucidal effect on influenza virus A (H1N1) in vitro and in ovo.",

Influenza virus is an enveloped RNA virus with hemagglutinin (HA) and Fig. 3 . Effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin on hemagglutinin. Effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin on hemagglutinin was evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin at a concentration of 5 mg/mL was serially diluted 2-fold and added to the 96-well plate. The standardized hemagglutinin viral solution was added to the 96-well plate. Then, 0.6% chicken red blood cells suspension was added to the mixtures as described in the Material and Methods. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) neuraminidase (NA) embedded in the lipid envelope. Viral adsorption to cells is the initial step of influenza infection, which is performed via the binding between sialic acid on the cell surface and hemagglutinin of the virus (Skehel and Wiley, 2000) . Results of HAI assay showed that exposure to epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin or goitrin did not affect the hemagglutinin activity of H1N1 virus. The components were indicated not to interfere with the binding of sialic acid and hemagglutinin. On the other hand, for the release of the influenza virus from the cell, NA functions as an enzyme cleaving sialic acid groups from the host glycoproteins (Huang et al., 2008) . Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were found to exert low inhibition rates on neuraminidase by a NA inhibition assay. The components were indicated not able to prevent budding of progeny virus from the cell membrane. Therefore, it is implied that epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin play their antiviral activity by acting as virus neutralizers, which associate with some component on the viral envelope without interfering with viral adsorption or budding. Based on the IC 50 values obtained from CPE inhibition assay, the activity of the compounds in vitro was in the order of progoitrin = goitrin > epigoitrin > epiprogoitrin. Comprehensive comparison of the minimum concentrations exhibiting 100% inhibition and the inhibition rate at a minimum investigated concentration of 0.625 mg/mL obtained from HA assay on embryonated eggs, the activity of the compounds in ovo was in the similar order of progoitrin > goitrin > epigoitrin > epiprogoitrin. When comparing the potency of the antiviral activity between the monomers, no remarkable difference was found between the precursor and the myrosinase-derived product (epiprogoitrin vs. epigoitrin and progoitrin vs. goitrin). On the contrary, considerable discrepancy was observed between the enantiomers (epiprogoitrin vs. progoitrin and epigoitrin vs. goitrin). The gap between the antiviral potency of progoitrin and epiprogoitrin was larger than that between goitrin and epigoitrin. S-enantiomers (progoitrin and goitrin) claimed higher activity than R-enantiomers (epiprogoitrin and epigoitrin). It is implied that the heteroaromatic chain/ring is the main functional group of the Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolates isomers and their breakdown products. And cyclization of the heteroaromatic chain to the oxazoline ring has no obvious influence on the function. The stereogenic center (chiral carbon atom) in the heteroaromatic chain of epiprogoitrin and progoitrin and in the oxazoline ring of epigoitrin and goitrin is an important structural feature from both chemical and biological points of view. Lucky enough, all the components were found to be safe both to the cells and the embryos.",

The finding enriched the pharmacology and the mechanism for research and development of Isatidis Radix, the most common traditional medicine used for treating influenza. Further mechanistic studies implied that the above components had no inhibitory effect on hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Thus, the attachment to the viral envelope without disturbing viral adsorption or budding to host cells was suggested to contribute critically to the mode of antiviral action of the components. Potential activity on other influenza virus targets like endonuclease, viral polymerase, nucleoprotein or M2 protein needs future exploration. With accurate anti-viral efficacy and low toxicity, epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin from Isatidis Radix are expected to be used as promising antiviral drug resources. Consequently, further validation including in vivo evaluation and clinical trials are required before introducing them from the research into practical application. However, whether the glucosinolates and their enzymatic hydrolysates could inhibit other influenza viruses or not is unknown and the molecular mechanism still needs to be clarified by further investigation.",
