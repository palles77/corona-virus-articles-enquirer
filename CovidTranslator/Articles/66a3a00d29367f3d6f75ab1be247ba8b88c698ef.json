Solid phase immune electron microscopy (SPIEM) allowed quantification of NA1 virions and identification of faecal samples with optimal virus levels. NA1 particles were 36.6 nm in diameter, had an indefinite surface structure resembling that of human small round structured viruses (SRSVs), and a buoyant density of 1.34 g ml 31 . A single capsid protein of 49.4 kDa was detected by Western blotting in purified NA1 preparations prepared from post-infection but not pre-infection faecal samples and with post-but not pre-infection sera. NA1 was antigenically unrelated to the bovine enteric calicivirus NA2 by SPIEM. These properties were consistent with classification of NA1 within the Caliciviridae but demonstrated heterogeneity in the capsid composition of bovine enteric caliciviruses. \u00df",

Pre-and post-inoculation NA1 antisera were raised in a 50 days old gnotobiotic calf (P143) inoculated orally with 3 ml of a faecal \u00a2ltrate of NA1 prepared by passage of a 25% faecal emulsion in PBSK through a 0.45 Wm membrane \u00a2lter. The calf developed diarrhoea and recovered. Calici-like virus particles were identi\u00a2ed in faecal samples by electron microscopy but no other viruses were seen. Ten weeks later, a similar faecal \u00a2ltrate was inoculated intravenously and the calf was bled out 5 days later to provide antiserum. The antiserum was free of antibodies to bovine astrovirus, the UK strain of bovine rotavirus, bovine enteric coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, feline calicivirus and the Haden strain of bovine parvovirus (J.C. Bridger, personal observations).",

The speci\u00a2city of the protein band was con\u00a2rmed by examination of day 0 versus day 2 p.i. faecal samples, staining with pre-and postinoculation antisera and association with the presence of virus particles in CsCl gradients. No signal was seen with the day 0 faecal sample which did not contain virus particles but which was puri\u00a2ed in the same way as the day 2 p.i. faecal sample (Fig. 4a, track 1) . A comparable band was absent in the day 2 puri\u00a2ed fractions when probed with the pre-inoculation NA1 serum (Fig. 4b, track 2) . In CsCl density gradients, the protein band was observed only in the CsCl fraction with the peak number of virus particles and not in fractions with no or low numbers (not shown).",

The particle diameter of 36.6 nm and CsCl buoyant density of 1.34 g cm 33 were within the ranges for established caliciviruses, including the human SRSVs [12, 13] . In puri\u00a2ed preparations, NA1 morphology was con\u00a2rmed as being similar to human SRSVs. Puri\u00a2ed NA1 virions contained a single capsid protein, a property characteristic of caliciviruses. However, antigenic diversity between bovine enteric caliciviruses was demonstrated in vitro for the \u00a2rst time by the complete lack of cross-reactivity by SPIEM between NA1 and the established bovine enteric calicivirus NA2. This supported earlier experiments in vivo where the two viruses failed to cross-protect [9] . Considerable antigenic diversity is well established amongst human enteric caliciviruses (SRSVs) [14^16] . Further studies will be needed to establish the extent of antigenic diversity amongst bovine enteric caliciviruses and their relationship to the equivalent human viruses. The capsid molecular mass of 49.4 kDa, was lower than expected from the 57^63 kDa range reported for human enteric caliciviruses with SRSV morphology [12,13,17^20] . It was also lower than the 55 kDa molecular mass of the in vitro translated capsid protein of the Jena virus, the only other bovine enteric calicivirus with a known capsid molecular mass [8] . Considerable care was taken to determine the molecular mass of the NA1 capsid protein by electrophoresis of the capsid protein with molecular mass standard proteins. Capsid proteins with molecular masses less than 55 kDa have been associated with some calicivirus capsids but, in most instances, a higher molecular mass protein has been apparent [21^23]. There was no evidence that the NA1 49.4 kDa band represented a degradation product of the capsid protein. A higher molecular mass band was never seen in the NA1 preparations and the CsCl preparations used contained intact virus particles with typical SRSV size and morphology. Con\u00a2rmation of the low NA1 capsid molecular mass will have to await elucidation of the deduced amino acid sequence of the NA1 capsid protein from genomic analysis and recombinant capsid expression studies. However, it has not been possible to amplify the NA1 genome from faecal suspensions or puri\u00a2ed preparations using a range of PCR primers used successfully with NA2, further supporting the notion that bovine enteric caliciviruses are diverse.",

Earlier studies used direct electron microscopy but only low numbers of particles were identi\u00a2ed making it impossible to identify samples with adequate numbers of virions for further study [2, 9] . The present study showed that virions are not di\u00a4cult to detect if early samples are examined by SPIEM. SPIEM enabled NA1 to be detected in the absence of a cell culture infectivity assay or knowledge about its genomic composition and, thus, allowed us to characterise the virus. The short period of virus shedding seen in the experimental calves by SPIEM was similar to that found in experimental infections with the previously described bovine enteric calicivirus NA2 [7] and the human Norwalk virus [24, 25] but contrasts markedly with bovine rotaviruses, another enteric pathogen, which are excreted at high levels for 4^6 days. The short virus excretion period and the lack of a broadly reactive and sensitive detection method may explain why so few investigators have reported the involvement of caliciviruses in outbreaks of calf diarrhoea. Enteropathogens were not detected in 31% of diarrhoeic faecal samples in a study of the microbiology of calf diarrhoea in the UK [3] . Failure to detect caliciviruses may be the reason for the lack of a diagnosis and further studies are warranted.",
