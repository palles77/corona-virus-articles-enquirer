Three of the horses showed clinical abnormalities including pyrexia, coughing, leucocytosis and neutrophilia after the first 20h of transportation. Endoscopical examination of the trachea revealed exacerbation of airway inflammation as a result of transport in two of the three affected horses. A consistent finding in the affected horses was focal serous neutrophilic pneumonia affecting the cranio-ventral portion of the caudal lung lobe with a propensity to affect the right lung. Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus was isolated from the pneumonic areas, in which corresponding bacterial antigens were identified immunohistochemically. Viral cultures from the pneumonic lesions proved negative for respiratory viruses. It is suggested that transport predisposes the upper respiratory tract and the lower airways to invasion by the bacterium, with episodic pyrexia and acute pneumonia.",

In one study, 24\"4% of horses with pneumonia had recently been transported more than 500 miles (Raphael and Beech, 1982) . In a later study, in the UK, eight of 11 affected horses had been subjected to long-distance travel within the previous 24h (Mair and Lane, 1989) . Pulmonary defence mechanisms may be adversely affected by stress (Bayly et al., 1986; Chrisman, 1987; Traub-Dargatz et al., 1988) and airborne pathogens or irritants may be inhaled (Chrisman, 1987; Leadon et al., 1990) during transport. Further Studies on the effects of transport on equine respiratory infections have been made by Mair and Lane (1989) , Rooney (1991) , Hayakawa et al. (1993) and Oikawa et al. (1994) , but the pathogenesis is still obscure.",

For scanning electron microscopy, small tissue specimens were pre-fixed in a solution of glutaraldehyde 2% in 0'2 M sodium cacodylate buffer and rinsed in 0\"2 M cacodylate buffer. Then they were dehydrated in a graded acetone series and transferred to amyl acetate. The specimens were dried ",

            "text": "It is likely that transport adversely affected the normally effective mucosal defence mechanism in the airways, leading to invasion by S.z. (a common commensal micro-organism in the equine tonsil and nasopharynx) into the lower airways, thus inducing acute lower airway inflammation in the affected horses. Evidence supporting this possibility included (a) the abrupt onset of neutrophilic leucocytosis with an increase of both the absolute and relative number of neutrophils, associated with transport, (b) increased mucopus in the trachea after transport, (c) spread of S.z. from the upper to the lower trachea, where the organism would not normally be expected (Blunden and Mackintosh, 1991) , associated with neutrophilic tracheitis, (d) tracheal ciliary abnormality suggestive of impairment of mucociliary function in the airway, (e) a decrease in the amount of secretory granules in goblet cells and the glandular epithelium of the trachea (decreased mucous lining), and (t) acute pneumonic lesions containing S.z. and S.Z. antigen. Endoscopical and pathological findings in the trachea indicated that airway inflammation was initially present in some of the horses and was exacerbated by transport. These findings suggest that pre-existing mild airway infection leads to pneumonia when horses are subjected to a prolonged period of transportation, as has been claimed by Raphael and Beech (1982) . There seemed to be an association between the spread of S.z. in the airways and the presence of the organism in the palatine tonsil, with lacunar tonsillitis, in the affected horses. It has been reported that increased exposure of the lower respiratory tract to pathogenic microorganisms under conditions of environmental stress is accompanied by increased colonization of the palatine tonsil by agents such as Pasteurella spp. in lambs and sheep (Yates, 1988) . It is difficult to explain the association between transport and diminished mucosal defence mechanisms in the airways. One possible explanation is that the desiccating effects of exposure to air currents and low relative humidity while the transport vehicle is in motion (Leadon, 1994) may reduce the thickness of the respiratory mucous lining and prevent effective ciliary motility (Derksen, 1991) . The finding that the tracheal membrane surface was not glistening and moist and that the cilia often showed a deformed pattern with clubbed ends suggested that drying of mucous membranes had occurred. A further possibility is that a large number of airborne hay dust particles inhaled during transport may have suppressed the mucosal clearance capability of the airways, as plant material was detected frequently in the inflammatory exudates in the airways. A similar association was reported by Chrisman (1987) . Possible infection with unidentified viruses, mycoplasmata (Gerber, 1986 ) and chlamydiae (Burrell etal., 1986) as primary pathogens of equine respiratory infection cannot be ruled out, but in the present study the findings indicated that S.z. was the primary cause of lower airway inflammation. Profuse migration of neutrophils in the lung seemed to develop as a result of S.Z. infection, suggesting that injury to pneumocytes and endothelial cells may be caused in part by tissue-damaging enzymes released from these degenerating cells (Yates, 1988) . The leucocyte response in the peripheral blood seems consistent with this finding. Platelets closely associated with the endothelial surface might enhance neutrophil adhesion and congestion of the microvasculature, leading to vascular damage, increased capillary permeability (Jorgensen et al., 1970) , intra-alveolar effusion, and pleural and interlobular septal oedema.",
