In this study, we used documented data of 117,000 patients world-wide with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This study proposes an AI model to help hospitals and medical facilities decide who needs to get attention first, who has higher priority to be hospitalized, triage patients when the system is overwhelmed by overcrowding, and eliminate delays in providing the necessary care. The results demonstrate 93% overall accuracy in predicting the mortality rate. We used several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to predict the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. In this study, the most alarming symptoms and features were also identified. Finally, we used a separate dataset of COVID-19 patients to evaluate our developed model accuracy, and used confusion matrix to make an in-depth analysis of our classifiers and calculate the sensitivity and specificity of our model.",

The primary purpose of feature selection is to find the most informative features and eliminate redundant data to reduce the dimensionality and complexity of the model [11] . We used univariate and multivariate filter method and wrapper method to rank the features and select the best feature subset [11] . Figure 2 demonstrates the steps of filter and wrapper method that we used for feature selection. Filter methods are very popular (especially for large datasets) since they are usually very fast and much less computationally intensive than wrapper methods. Filter methods use a specific metric to score each individual feature (or a subset of features together). The most popular metrics used in filter methods include correlation coefficient, Fisher score, mutual information, entropy and consistency and chisquare parameters [11] .",

The best neural network results were achieved with two hidden layers with 10 neurons in the first layer and 3 neurons in the second layer. We used sigmoid function as the hidden layer activation function and used stochastic gradient optimizer, constant learning rate and the regularization rate of alpha = 0.01. The SVM model was configured with linear kernel, and regularization parameter C=1.0. The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method combined of multiple decision tree predictors that are trained based on random data samples and feature subsets [17] .
