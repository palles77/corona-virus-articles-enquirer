Here, we report the use of lentiviral vectors for long-term in vivo delivery of RNAi selectively to resident alveolar macrophages (AMs), key immune effector cells in the lung. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this approach by RNAi-based downregulation of p65 (RelA), a component of the pro-inflammatory transcriptional regulator, nuclear factor B (NF-B) and a key participant in lung disease pathogenesis. In vivo RNAi delivery results in decreased induction of NF-B and downstream neutrophilic chemokines in transduced AMs as well as attenuated lung neutrophilia following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Through concurrent delivery of a novel lentiviral reporter vector (lenti-NF-Bluc-GFP) we track in vivo expression of NF-B target genes in real time, a critical step towards extending RNAi-based therapy to longstanding lung diseases. Application of this system reveals that resident AMs persist in the airspaces of mice following the resolution of LPS-induced inflammation, thus allowing these localized cells to be used as effective vehicles for prolonged RNAi delivery in disease settings.",

The lung is an attractive target organ for RNAi-based therapy owing to its air interface and unique architecture that offers its entire epithelial surface as a potential target for inhaled delivery. Previous work harnessing RNAi for treatment of acute pulmonary infections has shown promise [1] [2] [3] [4] but target gene knockdown has been transient and not restricted to specific lung lineages.",

Drawing on approaches pioneered for delivery of traditional gene therapy, a variety of methodologies have been used to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to cells or tissues with varying degrees of success. These approaches have included introduction of siRNA directly into a target tissue [5] [6] [7] or addition of a ligand to a coating or stabilizing molecule to help provide specificity of delivery. 8, 9 To achieve more prolonged expression, viral vectors have been used to deliver short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) under the control of Pol II or Pol III promoters. Lentiviral vectors in particular have been used to knock down gene expression by direct injection into target tissues. [10] [11] [12] [13] The ability to induce lineage-specific expression in a complex tissue such as the lung, however, has proven challenging. To improve upon existing technology and extend RNAi-based therapy to chronic lung diseases, a delivery system is needed that can target specific lung cell types to achieve sustainable, verifiable knockdown.",

To confirm successful, sustained p65 knockdown in target cells, we introduce a novel lentivirus-based approach to track transcription factor activity in live animals and demonstrate that shRNA-treated animals exhibit diminished activation of NF-B, knockdown of downstream chemokines, and decreased neutrophil influx in response to intratracheally instilled lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Unexpectedly, our studies revealed that lentivirally transduced resident AMs persist in the airspaces following the resolution of NF-B inflammatory activation, suggesting these cells as convenient vehicles for selective and sustained delivery of RNAi to the lung parenchyma.",

[22] [23] [24] [25] Although these studies suggest NF-B signaling as an intriguing target for knockdown in the lung, nonselective or global inhibition of NF-B can be highly toxic, as evidenced by embryonic lethality of the p65 knockout mouse in contrast with lineage-specific p65 knockouts. [26] [27] [28] Because intratracheally instilled lentivirus allows us to specifically transduce resident AMs, 14 we reasoned that selective knockdown of NF-B signaling in the lung might be achievable using this method. We therefore modified our RNAi-expressing vectors to knock down p65, the NF-B family member known to be most active in the lung. 29 We cloned a previously published shRNA sequence known to target p65 30 or a scrambled version of this sequence into pLVTHM to create the vectors lenti-GFP-shp65 and lenti-GFP-scramble (Figure 2a) . 15 To test the efficacy of lenti-GFP-shp65 in vitro, we assessed the effects of LPS stimulation on Raw 264.7 macrophages following transduction with lenti-GFP-shp65. Fifteen passages after lentiviral transduction of Raw cells, shp65 expression resulted in persistent knockdown of p65 mRNA and reduced NF-B-dependent cytokine secretion at baseline and (a) Schematic of the lenti-DsRed-shGFP vector designed for delivery of a shRNA sequence targeting enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP). In addition to constitutive expression of DsRed under control of the elongation factor 1 (EF1 ) promoter, a 20 bp sense sequence depicted in red targets eGFP and is followed by a linking loop sequence (blue) and then by the complementary, antisense sequence (green). A scrambled version of the same sequence was used as a control. The coding sequence is flanked by RNA Pol III transcriptional start (CCCC) and stop (TTTTT) sequences and expression is driven by the H1 promoter. An element (teto) precedes the H1 promoter that allows tetracycline inducibility of the H1 promoter in the presence of additional constructs that express a repressor fusion protein, TTR-KRAB. 15 In the absence of any TTR-KRAB-expressing construct (as used here), the H1-shRNA construct constitutively drives shRNA expression. All vectors in this manuscript include the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) to augment gene expression levels. in the presence of LPS stimulation (Figure 2b ; Supplementary Figure S1 ). Western blots of lysates from clonal populations of Raw 264.7 macrophages similarly found less p65 protein in lenti-GFP-shp65 transduced clones than in those transduced with lenti-GFP-scramble (Figure 2c ).",

In each of two repeat experiments (n = 6 per group and n = 10 per group), we found persistent knockdown of p65 message restricted to transduced (GFP + ) AMs 4 weeks after lentiviral treatment (Supplementary Figure S2) . In all samples, knockdown of gene expression was restricted to lentivirally transduced AMs with no evidence of spillover to nontransduced AMs. Knockdown of p65 in the transduced subset of AMs also resulted in a decreased presence of neutrophils in the BAL of LPS-exposed mice, suggesting a functionally relevant anti-inflammatory effect persisted 4 weeks after RNAi delivery (n = 10 per group; P = 0.02; Figure 2g ). Next, to compare our p65 knockdown results with complete ablation of p65, we used mice in which p65 is deleted following cre-mediated excision in myeloid cells including AMs (LysM-Cre x p65-floxed mice; hereafter p65 \u0394/\u039426 ). To assess the effects of relative p65 levels on global lung inflammatory signaling, we analyzed levels of 11 different cytokines in the BAL fluid (BALF) of both lenti-GFP-shp65 treated mice and p65 \u0394/\u0394 mice following LPS exposure. Because epithelial cells as well as AMs experience NF-B activation mediated via LPS binding of toll-like receptor 4, we anticipated that AM-specific p65 downregulation or ablation might not be sufficient to affect global lung expression of inflammatory genes. As expected, we found no decrease in NF-B dependent cytokine levels in the BALF of mice deficient in p65 resulting either from RNAi delivery (with lenti-GFP-shp65) or cre-mediated excision (p65 \u0394/\u0394 ) (data not shown). We performed preliminary testing of lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP in Raw 264.7 macrophages. After overnight infection, Raw macrophages were split before stimulation with either E. Coli-derived LPS (100 ng/ml), known to upregulate the NF-B pathway through specific ligation of toll-like receptor 4, or standard media (negative control wells). 31 In the unstimulated state, lenti-NF-B-luc- GFP-transduced Raw macrophages had levels of luminescence that were detectable just above background, consistent with either minimal basal levels of NF-B signaling in macrophages cultured on plastic or basal leak of the luciferase reporter (Figure 3d ).",

We administered IT lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP, or control lentiviruses constitutively expressing either GFP (negative control) or luciferase (positive control) to recipient C57BL/6 mice followed 4 weeks later by IT LPS (illustrated in Figure 4a ). Negative control mice and mice treated with lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP had no measurable background luciferase activity by photon flux imaging before IT LPS exposure (Figure 4b) . In contrast, mice treated with lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP followed by either 100 ng or 500 ng LPS exhibited luciferase activity localized to the thorax that was consistent with a dose response. We observed that luciferase activity in LPStreated animals diminished with time, raising the possibility of either resolution of NF-B activation or resident AM cell death following LPS stimulation. AMs have previously been presumed to have a short half life that may be further diminished by inflammatory activation suggesting rapid dropout of transduced AMs exposed to LPS might be expected. 32 More recent literature has instead reported that resident AMs persist in the alveolar space following LPS, but the issue remains controversial. 33 Because IT lentivirus tags resident AMs, we were able to address this question using an independent experimental approach. We performed BALs and harvested AMs from treated mice 4 weeks after LPS stimulation, a time point after decrement of our NF-B-luciferase reporter signal. Even after treatment with significant doses of LPS, a high percentage of lavaged AMs were found to be GFP + suggesting that tagged, resident AMs persisted in the alveolar space following inflammatory injury (Figure 4c) . It occurred to us that AMs persisting in the alveolar space after LPS treatment might lack the capacity to respond to LPS. To explore this question further, subsets of AMs lavaged from each animal were cultured overnight before incubation in media with or without LPS. Recapitulating our in vivo findings, AMs from lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP treated mice but not controls had increases in luminescence in response to LPS stimulation (Figure 4c) . This result demonstrated that tagged AMs persisting after LPS stimulation were in fact capable of upregulating NF-B activity in response to repeated LPS exposure.",

To determine whether our lenti-NF-B reporter vector could detect shRNA-mediated downregulation of p65, we sorted single GFP + Raw 264.7 cells following transduction with lenti-GFP-shp65 or -scramble (Figure 5a) . After expansion in culture, these clones were subsequently transduced with lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP. After incubation in LPS-containing or control media, we observed abrogation of NF-B-driven luciferase expression only in lenti-GFP-shp65transduced cells (Figure 5b) , suggesting that our reporter vector could be used to visualize p65 knockdown. To adapt this approach for use in live animals, we devised an experiment using mixtures of lenti-GFP-shp65 (or scramble) and an altered form of the lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP vector described above, now with the red dTomato fluorochrome cloned into the second position (lenti-NF-B-luc-dTomato; Figure 5a ). In preparation for this experiment, we performed IT injections of mixtures of lentiviruses containing either a red or green fluorochrome demonstrating that significant percentages of AMs are transduced with both constructs when a mixture of two lentiviruses is administered via IT instillation (Supplementary Figure S3) .",

Both groups were found to have significantly increased luciferase activity following IT LPS, as expected. However, the increase in luciferase activity following LPS was significantly attenuated in the lenti-GFP-shp65-treated group, consistent with diminished NF-B activation in the setting of p65 knockdown. To confirm that diminished NF-B driven luciferase levels resulted from p65 knockdown rather than dropout of transduced cells, we performed BALs on treated mice 8 hours after LPS stimulation. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry revealed no difference in the percentage of AMs transduced with lenti-NF-B-dTomato in the two experimental groups, indicating that cell death was not responsible for differences in NF-Bdriven luciferase activity (Figure 5e; Supplementary Figure S4) . The presence of dTomato in this experiment resulted in lower than usual transduction percentages following LPS exposure, possibly resulting from toxic effects of the fluorochrome as has been reported. 34 Repeat experiments substituting lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP resulted in higher transduction efficiency consistent with our typical results (data not shown).",

An intriguing question raised by our research is whether knockdown of p65 in a subset of AMs is sufficient to decrease NF-B signaling in the entire lung. Because AMs are present in the alveolar space and secrete cytokines and other effector molecules directly into the epithelial lining fluid, they have the potential to influence gene expression in alveolar epithelial cells. Our previously published data indicate that AM p65 is critical for whole lung cytokine production early in pneumococcal pneumonia. 28 The literature as a whole suggests that both resident AMs and alveolar epithelial cell NF-B signaling ultimately contribute to the inflammatory response in the lung. 35, 36 Our data support this hypothesis, as neither knockdown nor complete deletion of AM p65 resulted in decreased epithelial lining fluid cytokine levels in our experiments. Additional studies using a cre-lox system to induce epithelial lineage-specific ablation of p65 signaling might help to further address this issue in the future.",

However, the bulk of the HIV genome including these and other transcription factor binding sites have been deleted from the pHAGE and pLVTHM vectors used in our experiments both for safety purposes and to minimize LTRassociated transcriptional interference. 37 An alternative potential explanation of this finding might be the induction of immunological tolerance caused by lentiviral infection of antigen presenting cells, such as AMs and dendritic cells, as featured in our experiments. Lentiviral infection is known to activate toll-like receptor signaling in transduced dendritic cells in vitro and in vivo. 38 Although another report did not find a subsequent tolerance to LPS stimulation of lenti-transduced bone marrow derived dendritic cells in culture, 39 important differences between our studies exist, including our in vivo approach, and the timing and duration of LPS stimulation.

Although our results did not clearly demonstrate decreased survival of lenti-GFP-shp65-transduced AMs, this issue is particularly significant with a target molecule such as NF-B that has many downstream targets and is known to affect cell survival in the setting of injury. Indeed, constitutive high-level expression of any shRNA molecule could render the basic cellular gene silencing apparatus unavailable for other microRNAs involved in natural cellular metabolism. We anticipate that the use of inducible promoter systems to allow temporal control of gene expression will help to address this issue.",

In contrast to conventional methods for measuring transcription factor activity, our vector allows for linear tracking of p65 activation in individual, live animals. This characteristic has many potential advantages, not the least of which is the need for fewer animals to perform measurements at multiple time points. In comparison with existing methods, we expect that this will be a valuable tool to investigators performing studies of this and other transcription factors in vivo.",

Although the tropism of vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotyped lentivirus for AMs rather than lung epithelium in our system results from the architecture of the polarized epithelial cell surface, 14, 17, 41, 42 recently published literature suggests that lentiviruses can be engineered to achieve transduction of cell types displaying specific cell receptors, thus potentially allowing extension of this approach to other cell types. 43, 44 METHODS Animal studies and luciferase imaging.

An element (teto) precedes the H1 promoter that allows tetracycline (tet)-inducibility of the H1 promoter in the presence of additional constructs that express a repressor fusion protein, TTR-KRAB. In the absence of any TTR-KRAB-expressing construct (as used in the experiments described herein) the H1-shRNA construct constitutively drives shRNA expression. To adapt pLVTHM for use in GFP knockdown experiments, cDNA encoding a variant of the red fluorescent protein adapted from Discosoma sp. (DsRed-Express; Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was amplified by PCR with PmeI and SpeI restriction sites added to the 5 and 3 ends, respectively. This amplicon was cloned into the pLVTHM backbone downstream of the EF1 promoter by ligation to PmeI/SpeI cohesive ends. Previously published shRNA's targeting eGFP 16 or p65 30 were adapted for cloning into pLVTHM by the addition of MluI (5 ) and ClaI (3 ) restriction sites and were inserted into the 3 LTR using standard directional cloning techniques.

Traditional assays of NF-B activation require harvesting the cells (in vitro) or animal (in vivo) of interest to determine whether nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-B dimers has occurred, making longitudinal studies of individual animals impossible. To allow tracking of NF-B activation in vivo, we created a novel lentiviral vector (lenti-NF-B-luc-GFP, Figure 3a) containing four tandem copies of the NF-B consensus sequence located upstream of the minimal TA promoter (TAp), the TATA box of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter. Located downstream from TAp is the firefly luciferase reporter gene as well as a ubiquitously expressed GFP reporter under control of the constitutive mammalian ubiquitin C (UBC) promoter. This combination of reporter genes allows for independent tracking of transduced (GFP + ) cells by flow cytometry in addition to continuous, real-time assessment of NF-B activation levels by luciferase expression.",
