            "text": "When DBT-monolayers were infected with MHV3 (American Type Collection Strain previously submitted to three cycles of plaque purification in our laboratory), the formation of s}mcytia became visible at 6 hours postinfeetion (p.i.) and increased in both size and number parallel to the virus titer. Plaque assays were performed on DBT-monolayers in 3.5 cm-diameter petri dishes, following the method described by HII~ANO et, al. (4) . In DBT cells overlaid with ME)/I containing 1 per cent Noble agar, 5 per cent CS, 10 per cent TPB, and 1 : 10,000 neutral red, MHV3-plaques of 0.6--1.4 mm (mean value = 0.9 ram) in diameter could be counted at 40 hours p.i. The plaques were clearly-defined and sometimes contained a deeply-stained area at their center. Comparative titrations showed that the plaque assay gave tigers lower by about half a log than did the LDs0 method in mice (Table 1) . To ira.prove the sensitivity of the plaque assay we examined the effect of diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D) on the plaque formation and plaque diameter of MHV3, as BRADBUllNE and TYRREL]5 had reported that DEAE-D added to overlay agar increased the plaque number of human coronavirus (2). When DEAE-D was added to the overlay medium, no significant increase in the mean plaque number was produced compared with that of cultures overlaid with a DEAE-D-free medium. When DEAE-D was given along with the virus suspension to DBT cells, a clear-cut increase in the plaque number was found (Fig. 1) . The most remarkable increase was observed in those cells which received a. 50 ~zg/ml dose of DEAE-D. ~Vith a 25 tzg/mI dose of DEAE-D the mean plaque number was still 4 times greater than that of the control. With regard to the plaque diameter, no significant difference was found between the control group and a n y of the treated groups. The effect of trypsin on M H V 3 -p l a q u e formation in DBT-monolayers was also investigated. After infection, D B T cells were overlaid with MEM containing 1 per cent Noble agar and trypsin at a concentration of 5, 10 or 25 [zg/ml. The Dl3T-dishes were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours and plaques were stained with a second overlay medium consisting of MEM with 1 per cent Noble agar, 5 per cent CS, 10 per cent T P B and 1 : 10,000 neutral red at 37 \u00b0 C for 16--18 hours. Whereas an enhancing effect, on the plaque formation of myxoviruses has been reported (1, 6), no significant increase in the mean plaque n u m b e r of M H V 3 was observed. However, the plaques were larger (mean value --1.4 mm in diameter; range = 0.6--2.3 ram) and clearer t h a n those in the control group.",

As D B T is an established cell-line, it is far less troublesome in handling t h a n mouse macrophages and, through the plaque assay on D B T cells, virus titers are determined in a shorter period of time t h a n through the LDs0 assay in mice which is widely used as a titration m e t h o d of M H V 3 today. Consequently, the assay method of M H V 3 described above can a d v a n t a g e o u s l y replace not only plaque assay on mouse embryo cells or mouse maerophages but also the LDs0 assay in mice.",
