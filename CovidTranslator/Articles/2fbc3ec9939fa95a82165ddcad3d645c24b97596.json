Here, single particles of vesicular stomatitis virus, a prototype RNA virus, were used to infect individual BHK cells. Infected cells produced 50 to 8000 progeny virus particles, but these differences were lost upon subsequent culture, suggesting the diversity of yields reflected cell-to-cell differences rather than viral genetic variation. Cells infected at different phases of their cell cycle produced from 1400(early S) to 8700(G 2 M) infectious virus particles, coinciding with the middle-to-upper range of the observed distribution. Fluctuations in virus and cell compositions and noisy gene expression may also contribute to the broad distribution of virus yields. These findings take a step toward quantifying how environmental variation can impact the fitness distribution of a RNA virus.",

            "text": "Although RNA viruses employ different strategies to reproduce within their host cells, they share two requirements for growth. They require their own polymerases for replication of their RNA genomes, and like all viruses, they depend on host-cellular resources for biosynthesis of their nucleic acids and proteins. A distinguishing feature of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases is the highly error-prone nature of their processing (Drake and Holland, 1999; Gohara et al., 2004; Steinhauer et al., 1992) , which couples viral genome replication with genetic diversification of the virus progeny released from infected cells. Consequently, RNA viruses exist as genetically heterogeneous populations (Domingo et al., 1985; Goodenow et al., 1989; Holland, 1993) , and this genetic heterogeneity enables them to adapt to new host environments (Demma et al., 2005; Parrish and Kawaoka, 2005) , including environments containing anti-viral drugs (Domingo, 2003) . Moreover, mounting evidence suggests that the within-host genetic diversity of RNA virus populations plays a significant role in their pathogenicity (Aaskov et al., 2006; Carrillo et al., 2007; Farci et al., 2000; Vignuzzi et al., 2006) . Despite progress that has linked viral genetic variation to the functional diversity, adaptability and natural persistence of RNA viruses, little attention has been devoted toward understanding how factors beyond viral genetic differences, such as variation across host environments, can impact virus growth. The problem is challenging in part because potentially important cell-to-cell differences will be masked by standard culture methods that only provide average-virus or average-cell behaviors. We address this issue by measuring virus progeny yields from single cells infected by single particles of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), an RNA virus that exists as a quasi-species (Cuevas et al., 2005; Marcus et al., 1998; Steinhauer et al., 1989) and ranks among the most widely investigated systems for the study of viral evolution Elena et al., 1996; Holland et al., 1982; Nichol et al., 1989; Novella et al., 2007; Novella et al., 1999; Quer et al., 2001; Sanjuan et al., 2007) . We infect cells with a recombinant strain of VSV that expresses green-fluorescent protein, and we employ fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate individual cells that have been infected by single virus particles.",

The low MOI was used to minimize the likelihood that any cell was infected by more than one virus particle; 99.5 percent of the cells should receive zero of one virus particle at MOI 0.01, assuming particles are distributed to cells as a Poisson process. A GFP signal was apparent at 3 hours post infection (HPI), and the intensity increased between 3 and 5 HPI (Figure 1a) , indicative of infection-mediated expression of GFP. Infected cells could be distinguished from non-infected or dead cells at different times based on the intensities of their fluorescence signatures shown in the lower right quadrant of the panels in Figure 1a . Dead cells, which were discarded, were detected based on their uptake of propidium iodide (PI) and the resultant signal in the PI channel. Further, the fraction of detectable infected cells and their level of GFP expression increased monotonically between 2 and 5 HPI (Figure 1b) , consistent with the timing of protein expression in VSV infections.",

To test how these processes collectively impact virus production, infected cells were sorted into multiple subpopulations, each containing 500 cells, and these subpopulations were then cultured, sampled at different times, and assayed for viral progeny. The resulting one-step growth behavior for sorted cells followed a trajectory that was indistinguishable from control cells that had not been sorted (Figure 2 ), indicating that sample processing had no detectable effects on the production of virus from infected cells. Together, the results from Figures 1b and 2 indicate 3 HPI as an appropriate point for detection and sorting of infected cells, a point that preceded the start of detectable virus progeny release.",

As shown in Figure 3 (lower panel), seven descendents of low-fitness virus, drawn from samples of the initial distribution that produced between 10 PFU/cell and 500 PFU/cell, and eight descendents of high-fitness virus, drawn from samples of the initial distribution that produced more than 4500 PFU/cell, were amplified and characterized by one-step growth cultures. None of these 15 descendents of the initial population produced similar yields as their parental populations. Five descendents of low-fitness viruses and all eight descendents of highfitness viruses produced progeny yields that were essentially indistinguishable from each other, within 15 percent of 2550 PFU/cell. The remaining two descendents of the low-fitness virus produced lower-than-average yields at 1125 PFU/cell (descendent 1) and 1594 PFU/cell (descendent 2), which were significantly lower than the yields from the other 13 descendents (P < 0.0005). The persistence of the low-fitness phenotype during culture indicates a genetic contribution to the variation in fitness of these two isolates that is lacking in the other 13 isolates. The low fitness of these two isolates was further reflected by average plaque size measurements of 0.7 mm and 1.0 mm respectively, which fell below the 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 mm value measured from one of the average-yield descendents and the high-yield descendents (not shown).",

Our amplification of the high-fitness viruses involved neither repeated genetic bottleneck (plaque-to-plaque) passaging nor changes in growth conditions that can reduce the fitness of RNA viruses (Chao, 1990) , including VSV (Duarte et al., 1992; Elena and Moya, 1999) . Moreover, genetic bottleneck passaging followed by large-population passaging can give rise to gains in the fitness of VSV populations Miralles et al., 1999) , but the low-fitness viruses in this study were not cultured under such conditions. While it is unlikely, it remains conceivable that compensatory loss-or gain-of-fitness mutations in the high-and low-fitness isolates, respectively, occurred during amplification. Differences between parental and descendent virus yields might be attributed to differences in their determination; parental virus yields were measured from individual cells infected by single virus particles while descendent yields were measured from one-step virus cultures performed at MOI 5. However, when yield distributions were determined for cell cultures infected over the range of MOI in this study negligible differences were observed ( Figure S1 ). In light of these observations, the lack of correlation between parental and descendent virus yields in Figure 3 (upper versus lower panels) indicate that genetic differences among individual virus particles cannot account for the broad distribution of yields in Figure  3 (upper panel).",

            "text": "To reproduce, viruses rely on the biosynthetic machinery of the cells they infect. Larger cells may provide more resources for biosynthesis than smaller cells, so the total yield of viral progeny from an infected cell may correlate with the size of the cell. FACS was implemented to divide cells into high-, medium-, and low-forward scattering (FSC) populations (Figure 4a), and confirmed by microscopy that the measures of FSC correlated with cell size (Figure 4b ), as expected from theory (Sharpless and Melamed, 1976) . These subpopulations of infected cells, which ranged in average size from 14 to 20 microns, produced average virus yields of 2200 to 2900 PFU per cell, respectively (Figure 4c), consistent with the idea that larger cells can produce more viral progeny. If one extrapolates these measured relationships from the extreme observed values of FSC to estimate the corresponding cell size and yield, then cell sizes spanning 8 to 24 microns would produce virus yields of 1300 to 3400 PFU per cell, respectively, falling short of the observed 50-to-8000 PFU per cell range observed in Figure  3 . Alternatively, one may argue that virus yields should scale with the volume of cellular resources, so a three-fold range of cell diameters would give a 27-fold range of cell volumes, which is far short of the 160-fold range of virus yields. Similarly, Delbr\u00fcck's classic study of bacteriophage yields from single infected bacterial cells showed a greater than 20-fold range of phage progeny yields while bacterial host cells only differed by 3-fold in volume (Delbr\u00fcck, 1945 ). An alternative interpretation of our results is that cells become larger as a consequence of more efficient virus replication. Rounding of cells occurs about 4 HPI owing to expression of the VSV matrix protein (Blondel et al., 1990) , and such rounding could be correlated with changes in cell size. It remains an open question whether variations in the expression of VSV matrix protein or other mechanisms might influence the cell size distribution.",

When a cell leaves the cycle, either temporarily or permanently, it may further become \"quiescent\" (G 0 ). To test the effects of cell phase on virus production, we initially arrested cells at the G 1 /S boundary with aphidicolin (Foisy and Bibor-Hardy, 1988; Pedrali-Noy et al., 1980) , released this drug block, and tracked the progress of the resulting cell populations over 12 hours. Measurements of cellular DNA levels showed a regular pattern of progression of the cells as a population through the cell cycle ( Figure 5a ). Cells synthesize DNA, indicated by the increase in DNA signal from 0 to 6 hours following release of the G 1 S block, and the shift in the intensity of this signal from high to low between 6 and 8 hours reflects cell division. The corresponding distribution of cells across different phases of the cell cycle, estimated from these DNA distributions, indicated that the cells initially populated primarily the early S phase, progressed to the late S phase, and then to the G 2 M phase (Figure 5b) , as expected. Cells in two or more phases, starting at 6 hours, reflect some loss of synchrony as the cells either progressed through or entered the cell cycle. When cells at these different phases were infected at MOI 5, they produced average virus yields spanning from 1800 \u00b1 200 PFU/cell to 5100 \u00b1 400 PFU/cell, as shown in Figure 5c (data points). By contrast, the non-synchronized cell population produced an average of 2500 \u00b1 200 PFU/cell. A simple super-position model, which accounted well for the observed yields ( Figure  5c , lines), provided estimates for virus yields from each phase of the cell cycle, summarized in Table 1 . The predicted virus yield from an infection of non-synchronous cells, based on measured distributions in cell cycle and the values in Table 1 , gave a value of 2900 PFU/cell, about 12 percent higher than our experimental observations, providing an estimate of uncertainty associated with our model. Our observations suggest cells enriched in the G 2 M phase, when infected, would produce a higher average yield than non-synchronized cells, and this prediction has been verified ( Figure S2 ). Overall, segregation of cells based on their cellcycle phase produced a broader range of virus yields than our segregation based on cell size, suggesting that the phase of the cell provides a better foundation for understanding how the resources of the host quantitatively influence the production of viral progeny.",

            "text": "By characterizing how different factors contribute to the distribution of virus growth phenotypes, we have initially sought simple underlying mechanisms. Here we explore the potential multi-layered nature of interactions between genomes and their environments. Genetic differences among clones were identified here based on the persistence of two out of seven low-yield phenotypes from one generation to the next. Owing to the high genetic variability of VSV populations (Steinhauer et al., 1989) , we would expect many viruses within our initial population to be genetically different but indistinguishable from each other based on phenotypic measures of average virus yield or plaque size. By genome sequencing and further study of the two persistent low-yield strains, one might well identify relevant mutations and suggest mechanisms that account for their effects on growth phenotype. Such studies have been performed for VSV (Novella and Ebendick-Corpus, 2004; Novella et al., 2005) and many other viruses (Carrillo et al., 2007; Duffy et al., 2006; Larder and Kemp, 1989; Poon and Chao, 2006; Yen et al., 2005) . We found the G 2 M transition to be a highly productive environment for VSV growth in BHK cells and suggested that viruses use the resources that they encounter by chance in a susceptible cell. However, one should note that viruses can also actively influence their host-cell environments. Many viruses, including papillomaviruses, Epstein-Barr virus and human T-cell leukemia virus type I, encode genes that actively alter the cell cycle by deregulating cell growth and division, processes that can promote cancer (Butel, 2000) . Moreover, RNA viruses, DNA viruses and retroviruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to specifically arrest the cell cycle at the G 2 M transition (Davy and Doorbar, 2007) , and studies of a positive-strand RNA coronavirus indicate that viral-mediated arrest at the G 2 M transition provides favorable conditions for viral replication (Dove et al., 2006) . It is not yet known how the G 2 M transition, beyond contributions from biosynthetic resources that scale with cell size, enhances VSV growth or whether VSV possesses mechanisms to actively arrest cells at G 2 M.",

            "text": "In addition to genetic and cell size or cell-cycle effects, fluctuations in virus particle and cell compositions, as well as stochastic gene expression, may well contribute to cell-to-cell differences in virus yield. A single VSV particle releases one negative-strand RNA genome and about 50 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase molecules into its host cell (Thomas et al., 1985) . Differences in the levels of packaged and released polymerase during the earliest stages of infection, could be amplified owing to fluctuations in levels of cellular resources, including precursors essential for RNA and protein synthesis. Even in the absence of differences in virus or host resource levels stochastic fluctuations associated with small numbers of reactive species may also plausibly contribute to a broad distribution of virus progeny yields. For example, computer simulations (Arkin et al., 1998; Srivastava et al., 2002; Weinberger et al., 2005) and experiments (Weinberger et al., 2005) of gene regulatory components of lambda phage, HIV and hepatitis B virus have exhibited 10-to 100-fold differences in gene expression owing to amplification of intrinsic fluctuations in reaction rates.",

Owing to these different length and time scales over which virus infections act, different measures of fitness may be appropriate. Here we have defined the fitness of an individual virus particle by the yield of offspring virus particles that are produced when it infects a single host cell. If host cells are available in excess of virus particles, competition among different virus strains for cells, perhaps over multiple generations of virus growth, may define alternative measures of fitness based, for example, on the rate rather than yield of virus production (Cuevas et al., 2005) . In the presence of anti-viral drugs, fitness may be defined by whether or not virus strains carry mutations for drug-resistance. Moreover, fitness may be defined by an ability of a virus strain to escape surveillance and destruction by the innate or adaptive immune defenses of the infected host (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2006) . Advances in our ability to reliably and precisely quantify other measures of fitness will motivate a need to better understand how they are quantitatively influenced by genetic, environmental, and stochastic factors.",

The cells were released from the aphidicolin block by washing with HBSS three times (1 ml per wash) prior to incubation in standard growth medium. (2) Cell cycle analysis. Cells were synchronized as described above. Every 2 h in a 12 h period after drug removal, cells from one plate were dislodged by trypsinization and then either counted by trypan blue exclusion or resuspended in 70% ethanol.

The stained samples were analyzed by a FACSCalibur benchtop analyzer equipped with 488 nM and 633 nM lasers. The DNA histograms show the number of cells per channel in the ordinate and the relative fluorescence intensity which varies in proportion with the DNA content in the abscissa. The contribution of each cell phase to the observed signal was estimated using MODFIT LT (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Beforehand, the DNA content of a non-synchronized cell population was analyzed to locate the G 0 G 1 channel assuming that the majority of the cells were in this phase. The position of that G 2 M channel was then determined given that the amount of DNA content of the cells in this phase was twice of that in G0G1. (3) Measurement of viral productivity in different phases of the cell cycle. Cells were synchronized as described above.
