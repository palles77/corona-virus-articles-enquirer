With the help of peroxidase-labelled MAbs at least nine epitopes (epitope clusters) located on three distinct antigenic sites were identified on the hexon. Epitope on antigenic site I recognized by two MAbs could be the genus specific antigenic determinant based on the broad reactivity patterns of the MAbs. Epitopes on the antigenic site II recognized by fifteen MAbs could be divided into seven epitope clusters according to the competition patterns. Antigenic site III recognized by one MAb completely differs from the antigenic site I and on the basis of one-way blocking with all the MAbs specific for antigenic site II, should be also different from the latter one. The data suggest that the seven epitope clusters of antigenic site II contain partially overlapping epitopes and may be a part of a large single immunodominant antigenic region on AV 1 hexon as well as on hexons of heterologous types.",

Since the nonspecific binding of individual conjugates varied considerably, binding to control antigen (BSA) was taken to represent background, and binding of each conjugate to viral antigen as maximum binding. This difference was taken to represent 100 per cent binding, and the relative inhibition by the competing first antibody was normalized to this scale in each individual test. Results were expressed as a percentage of competition, and rated as complete inhibition if the first three dilutions caused more than 70 per cent reduction of absorbanee, partial inhibition if the reduction was between 60 to 40 per cent and results were considered negative if the reduction of absorbance was not more than \u00a20 per cent (17) .",

MAbs of epitope cluster I I / 3 show a n o t h e r form of reciprocal competition, i.e., one of the MAbs (2 C 4) partially-inhibits the binding of three other MAbs (2 C 6, 1 B 2 and 2 A 5), and the latter three MAbs completely inhibit each other (Fig. 5 ). MAbs specific for epitope cluster I I / 4 show similar inhibition p a t t e r n s as those of epitope cluster 1I/3. It means, t h a t one Mbkb of this group (2 B 5) could partially inhibit the binding of two other MAbs (1 A 6 and 2 C 1) showing reciprocal partial inhibition patterns, but the two latter MAbs completely inhibit the binding of each ",

After preincubation at 37 \u00b0 C 50 ~l of each mixture was added to AV 1 hexon coated wells and the absorbanees were determined both in the presence and in the absence of heterologous hexon types. types of the same subgenus (types 2, 5, and 6). As can be seen, in the case of the MAbs 1 A 3, 2 A 1, and 2 A 6, each hexon types mixed with the MAbs causes nearly 100 per cent inhibition. The results with types 1, 2, and 6 were similar, when mixed MAb 2 B 2, while type 5 could not compete the binding of this MAb. The curves representing the competition with heterologous types of subgenus D (Fig. 8 a-c) only in the case of MAb 1 A 3 are similar to the types of subgenus C, and in high concentration of type 9 with MAbs 2 A 1, 2 A 6, and 2 B 2.

These MAbs have broad reactivity patterns, because they reacted with. the hexons of all human AV types studied by ELISA and HA (2) , and with bovine AV type 3 in gel precipitation experiment (3) . Their specificity to sterically independent epitopes comparing to MAbs H 12, 2 A 1, and 1 B 2 were also demonstrated by gel diffusion experiments. MAb H 12, however reacted with all human AV types tested, failed to react with bovine AV type 3 both in ELISA and I~ (unpublished data), as well as in gel diffusion experiments (3). This MAb did not inhibit the binding of the two MAbs specific for antigenic site I and showed only unidirectional complete blocking of the MAbs specific for the antigenic site II. These findings suggest that the epitope recognized by MAb H 12 should be considered as a sterieMly distinct antigenic determinant (site III).",

The cause of the nonreciprocal (unidirectional or one-way) inhibition could be a static change of the epitope due to the attached MAb, which than prevents partiMly the binding of the labelled MAbs. Neighbouring epitopes may be located in a groove on the surface of the antigenic site, therefore the binding of the competing MAb could sterieMty block the access of the labelled l~L~b specific for a different epitope in the groove (7, 8, 10, 15) .
