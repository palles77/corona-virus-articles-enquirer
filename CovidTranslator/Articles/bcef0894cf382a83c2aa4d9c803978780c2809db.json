We show that a number of human haematopoietic cancer cell lines 28 and the canine kidney MDCK II (but not MDCK I) cells are susceptible to H17-pseudotypes 29 (H17-PV). We observed with microarrays and qRT-PCR that the dog leukocyte antigen DLA-30 DRA mRNA is over expressed in late passaged parental MDCK and commercial MDCK II cells, 31 compared to early passaged parental MDCK and MDCK I cells, respectively. The human 32 orthologue HLA-DRA encodes the alpha subunit of the MHC class II HLA-DR antigen-binding 33 heterodimer. Small interfering RNA-or neutralizing antibody-targeting HLA-DRA, drastically 34 reduced the susceptibility of Raji B cells to H17-PV. Conversely, over expression of HLA-DRA 35 and its paralogue HLA-DRB1 on the surface of the unsusceptible HEK293T/17 cells conferred 36 susceptibility to H17-PV. The identification of HLA-DR as an H17N10 entry mediator will 37 contribute to a better understanding of the tropism of the virus and will elucidate its zoonotic 38 transmission. 39 40",

Hence, 176 taking advantage of the high expression of HLA-DR on certain human hematopoietic 177 carcinomas 40 , we further explored H17-PV tropism using a panel of human leukaemia and 178 lymphoma cell lines (Fig. 2d) . We found that the Burkitt's lymphoma-derived Raji, Ramos and 179 BJAB B-lymphocytes and the B lymphoblastoid cells (B-LCL) show decreasing susceptibility, 180 in that order, to H17-PV. Kasumi-1 leukaemic cells showed marginal susceptibility in terms of 181 luciferase activity, while Molt-4 and HL-60 leukaemic cells, Jurkat T-cells, pro-monocytic THP-182 1 and U-937 cells, and primary B cells showed no susceptibility to the pseudotypes (Fig. 2d,  183 left Y axis). We hypothesised that the different susceptibility of the various cell types by H17-184 PV were due to disparate expression of HLA-DR, confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis for a non-185 polymorphic region of the \u03b1 chain of HLA-DR on the same samples (Fig. 2d , right Y-axis).

HEK293T/17 cells were 212 transiently transfected with the DRA expression vector, alone or in combination with DRB1. Taken together, HLA-DR is shown to function as a bona fide entry mediator for H17 but may 226 function with unknown factors that facilitate virus internalisation. Interaction between HLA-227 DR and H17 may trigger viral entry through canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis, but 228 could also trigger entry through an activation of cell signalling pathways that the virus 229 subverts to its advantage. Our finding therefore raises questions on the utility and possible 230 evolutionary advantage(s) that an APC-associated receptor would confer to H17N10 231 infectivity and broader fitness.

The measles virus for example, exploits macrophages or 234 dendritic cells, which traffic the virus to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue or regional 235 lymph nodes, resulting in local amplification and subsequent systemic dissemination by 236 viremia 46 . A similar strategy employed by H17N10 could provide an explanation on why viral 237 RNA was detected in different organs and tissues in carrier S. lilium bats (i.e. lung, kidney, 238 liver, intestine) and why the virus fails to grow in vitro in cell lines developed from the same 239 In this study we did not establish the stoichiometry of the HLA-DR: H17 engagement, or 250 clarify how the virus moves to sub-membranous regions and might hijack the receptor-251 mediated signalling pathway to promote its internalization. It is likely that the determinants 252 of viral entry in vivo are more complicated. We cannot rule out the use by H17N10 (as by 253 other bat-borne viruses, e.g. SARS CoV 51, 52 ) of more than one molecular species as (co-) 254 receptors. Nevertheless, the implication of this study is that H17N10 has the capacity to 255 enter human HLA-DR + cells and our work provides substantial evidence that the H17N10 256 virus has zoonotic potential.
