Whereas several single and double mutants remained dimeric, insertion of either two or four amino acids at the dimerization interface resulted in a monomeric form of the protein (mGRFT). Monomeric character of the modified proteins was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and by their high resolution X-ray crystal structures, whereas their binding to carbohydrates was assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry. Cell-based antiviral activity assays utilizing different variants of mGRFT indicated that the monomeric form of the lectin had greatly reduced activity against HIV-1, suggesting that the antiviral activity of GRFT stems from crosslinking and aggregation of viral particles via multivalent interactions between GRFT and oligosaccharides present on HIV envelope glycoproteins. Atomic resolution crystal structure of a complex between mGRFT and nonamannoside revealed that a single mGRFT molecule binds to two different nonamannoside molecules through all three carbohydrate-binding sites present on the monomer.",

In particular, infections caused by viruses such as HIV, SARS-associated corona virus, ebola hemorrhagic fever virus, and hepatitis virus are in need of novel ways of prevention and therapy. One of the promising, although not well-developed strategies for combating these viral infections is inhibiting viral entry with lectins such as cyanovirin-N (CV-N), scytovirin (SVN), or griffithsin (GRFT) (Balzarini, 2007) . GRFT, originally isolated from extracts of red alga Griffithsia sp., has demonstrated antiviral activity against both HIV (Mori et al., 2005) and SARS (O'Keefe et al., 2010; Zeitlin et al., 2009 ). It has the most potent activity of all known lectins against various HIV-1 isolates, with EC 50 in the midpicomolar range. Furthermore, GRFT has been shown to be amenable to large-scale, agricultural manufacturing (O'Keefe et al., 2009) . The stability and low immunogenicity of GRFT make it a candidate for formulation as a component of vaginally or rectally applicable microbicides (Zeitlin et al., 2009) .",

However, we were not able to prepare soluble complexes of GRFT with branched carbohydrates corresponding to those present on viral envelopes, such as a synthetic nonamannoside or a slightly larger Man9 (Figure 1 ), since such complexes precipitated from solution even at very low concentration. For that reason, previously we used molecular modeling to derive the putative structure of the GRFT-Man9 complex (Zi\u00f3 lkowska et al., 2007a) . GRFT is a domain-swapped homodimer with the first 16 amino acids of one monomer completing the b-prism-I fold of the other monomer . Each monomer comprises one binding surface at opposite ends of a double-prism homodimer, and each binding surface is composed of three carbohydrate-binding pockets, for a total of six binding pockets per GRFT dimer. Still to be answered are questions about the exact mechanism for the antiviral activity of GRFT and its mode of binding to high-mannose, branched carbohydrates. Logical models for the mechanism of GRFT's activity include (i) coating of viral particles and blocking interaction with cell surface receptors, (ii) inhibiting viral entry postattachment, (iii) aggregation/agglutination of viral envelope glycoproteins or particles, and (iv) enhancement of the cellular immune response. One approach to finding answers to these questions appeared to be through engineering, expression, and purification of a monomeric form of GRFT (here called mGRFT). The availability of such a protein was expected to allow us to directly address the role of multivalency and crosslinking in GRFT binding to carbohydrates and to elucidate how these binding interactions relate to antiviral activity. It was also anticipated that an antiviral protein of reduced size might exhibit potentially more advantageous physiological attributes.",

Our initial efforts at creating monomeric GRFT were aimed at stabilizing its hinge region (residues 15-19) so as to allow the monomeric form to predominate, and on removing the hydrogen bonded interactions with the N-terminal peptide. We have thus created a series of mutants, starting from the replacement of Ser65 (which makes a hydrogen bond with the amide group of Gly8) by an aromatic residue, such as tyrosine or tryptophan. Additional mutations were made at positions 2 (L2V), 6 (K6V), 106 (S106E), and 119 (E119I), both singly and in combination with the mutation S65Y. None of these initial attempts resulted in the formation of monomeric GRFT and the resulting proteins retained their dimeric character.",

Furthermore, structures of GRFT in complex with maltose and N-acetylglucosamine (Zi\u00f3 lkowska et al., 2007b) contain an ethylene glycol molecule spanning the 7.4 \u00c5 gap between the swapped strands at the dimerization interface. We hypothesized that the gap between the swapped strands can be bridged by insertion of two or more residues between Ser16 and Gly17, at least one being a serine (to provide polar interactions similar to those of ethylene glycol). Additionally, sequences containing GS are commonly found in natural linkers (Lubkowski et al., 1999) ; thus, we selected either one or two of these dipeptides in designing mGRFT.",

However, regardless of the crystallization conditions, all tested crystals were isomorphous in the tetragonal space group I4 1 . Diffraction data were obtained at a resolution of 0.97 \u00c5 ( Table 1 ). The electron density maps show very clearly that the complex was formed, delineating unambiguously the position of the D1 and D2 branches of the nonamannoside ( Figure 4A ) and of the two connecting b-mannoses. The density was partial and weak in the region where mannose 5 of the D3 branch would be expected. The binding mode of nonamannoside to 1GS-S is different in some important respects from our previous computational model (Zi\u00f3 lkowska et al., 2007a) , or from the recently proposed mode of binding of Man9 to actinohivin, a lectin isolated from Longispora albida which is also presumed to contain three carbohydrate-binding pockets creating an equilateral triangle (Tanaka et al., 2009 ). The terminal mannose 11 of the D1 branch and mannose 8 of the D2 branch of the nonamannoside bind into two pockets of 1GS-S (pockets 3 and 1 according to the previously introduced nomenclature; Zi\u00f3 lkowska et al., 2006) , with the rest of the nonamannoside molecule spanning an arch between these two binding pockets. In addition, binding pocket 2 is occupied by mannose 7 of the D2 branch of a symmetry-related nonamannoside molecule, and hence the overall ratio between polysaccharide and lectin is still one to one. The weight-averaged molecular mass of the nonamannoside-saturated complex was 16.73 \u00b1 0.13 kDa, suggesting a two-to-one ratio of nonamannoside to 1GS-S in solution. This apparent stoichiometric ambiguity can be explained by the difference in the primary structure of the three binding The hinge region of the swapped strands is shown in the dashed rectangle with the glycerol molecule seen in two structures colored in cyan. The lock region is shown in the dashed oval with the relevant hydrophobic residues (L2, I101, and Y117) from both chains in stick configuration.

The preceding residues are Asp67 and Asp109 in pockets 3 and 1, respectively, whereas Ser26 forms part of pocket 2. This difference in primary structure leads to significant alteration of the electrostatic landscape of the carbohydrate-binding surface ( Figure 4B ). Whereas the surface potential is highly negative in pockets 1 and 3, it is much less negative in pocket 2. In addition, Asp67 and Asp109 are both within hydrogen bond distance from the nonamannoside, while Ser26 in pocket 2 is too far to contribute to binding. It is thus likely that pockets 1 and 3 offer better binding to the terminal mannoses of two branches of nonamannoside, while pocket 2 is occupied more transiently. It can be postulated that when this site becomes temporarily occupied by b-mannose 7 of a nonamannoside bound to another protein molecule, the resulting symmetric interactions lead to creation of a stable crystal lattice, which ultimately changes the apparent stoichiometry of the complexes. These results point out that the originally proposed model in which only the terminal mannoses of each branch bound to a single molecule of GRFT (Zi\u00f3 lkowska et al., 2007a) was most likely oversimplified, with the observed mode of crosslinking being only one of many that lead to prevention of the viral entry by this class of lectins.",

Compared with the dimannose titration experiments, titrations of GRFT and mGRFT with mannopentaose resulted in a 3-fold increase in affinity, presumably due to the three terminal nonreducing mannoses of the mannopentaose. However, the 6-fold increase in enthalpy could not be accounted for by a simple additive enthalpic contribution of the exposed terminal mannoses in the mannopentaose (DH mannopentaose > > 2DH a1,3 dimannose + DH a1,6 dimannose ), suggesting that chemically equivalent nonreducing mannoses in the context of a branched sugar structure (mannopentaose) yielded better binding contacts and better binding affinity with GRFT as compared with the linear dimannoses. In the absence of a crystal structure of this branched sugar with GRFT, it is unclear how these terminal mannoses occupy the sugar binding sites. However, from examining the entropy of binding it was apparent that crosslinking of proteins by the mannopentaose did not occur, as this thermodynamic parameter remained favorable (Table 2, positive TDS). Similar to the dimannoses, the mannopentaose appeared to mediate more contacts with the mGRFT protein (negative DH) than with dGRFT.",

In terms of energetics, the bindings were largely enthalpically driven (negative DH; DG = DH -TDS), with 50-fold increase in enthalpy over the dimannoses, and an approximate 10-fold increase in enthalpy over the mannopentaose. Such an increase in enthalpy indicated the presence of numerous favorable contacts between the sugar and the protein, in addition to those mediated by the sugar-binding pockets. This was suggested by the observed crystallographic results (Figure 4 ) that showed how a single nonamannoside molecule spanned an arch of 15 \u00c5 on 1GS-S mGRFT. The expanse of protein surface area bridged by the sugar could have allowed the two binding partners to come close enough together to mediate multiple, short-distance contacts to account for the large increase in enthalpy observed in the calorimetry experiments. Moreover, the observed calorimetric stoichiometry of two nonamannosides bound per mGRFT (data not shown) indicated multisite binding and additionally supported analytical ultracentrifugation experiments which showed a weighted average of 16.73 kDa for the nonamannoside-mGRFT complex and which suggested that, on average and in solution, two molecules of nonamannoside were bound to one molecule of 1GS-S mGRFT. Where the binding entropy of the smaller sugars was favorable, the unfavorable binding entropy (negative TDS) of nonamannoside-GRFT complex strongly suggested that nonamannoside acted as a multivalent ligand, binding separate protein molecules and greatly limiting the conformational freedoms of both binding partners as well as potentially trapping more water molecules and further reducing the entropy of the system. The calorimetry data, taken together with the crystallographic structures and the analytical ultracentrifugation data, indicated that the multisite binding by GRFT and the multivalent binding mediated by the nonamannoside contributed to the tight affinity/avidity of the binding system. The avidity of the multisite, multivalent interaction between GRFT and nonamannoside was also seen in dynamic light scattering experiments (data not shown) where the percent polydispersity indicated the presence of multiple species ranging from monomer to higher combinations of the protein and oligosaccharide.",

Previously, the antiviral lectin cyanovirin-N (CV-N), which has two carbohydrate-binding domains, has been shown to be able to simultaneously bind to both HIV gp120 and gp41 (O'Keefe et al., 2000) . This interaction was later shown to be due to specific multivalent interactions between CV-N and high mannose oligosaccharides on the surface of HIV envelope glycoproteins (Shenoy et al., 2001) . Thus, it was reasonable to investigate the effect that multivalency might play in the carbohydrate-binding and biological activity of both mGRFT (with three unidirectional binding sites) and dGRFT (with a bidirectional composition of six binding sites) with gp120. As can be seen from the results of the ITC experiments (Table 2) , dGRFT shows approximately 15-fold greater affinity for gp120 than mGRFT. This difference in measured affinity is likely more related to a change in avidity resulting from the decreased off-rate of dGRFT (which caused significant precipitation of gp120 in solution) as compared with mGRFT (which did not cause similar precipitates). This result was additionally supported by dynamic light scattering experiments (data not shown) which showed the dGRFT-gp120 complex to be fully precipitated, whereas the mGRFT-gp120 complex to be in a fluid, transitory, and fully soluble system composed of a number of differently sized species. Hence, the reduction in crosslinking of HIV envelope glycoproteins by the more limited carbohydratebinding interface of mGRFT, as evidenced by the lack of precipitates, resulted in a significant reduction in the measured affinity/ avidity of this molecule for gp120. The functional relevance of this lack of crosslinking on antiviral activity was further investigated via assessment of the anti-HIV activity of the various GRFT mutants.",

Nine different mutant forms of griffithsin were tested for their activity in protecting CEM-SS cells from HIV. As can be seen in Table 4 , dGRFT was potently active against HIV with and EC 50 < 0.2 nM. Several additional mutants made in the effort to design an obligate monomeric from of GRFT were also tested. The mutant forms of GRFT which did not form monomers (S65W, S65W/S106E, E119I/ S65Y, K6V/S65Y, L2V/S65Y) retained potent anti-HIV activity with EC 50 values below 1 nM. However, all monomeric forms of GRFT exhibited severely diminished anti-HIV activity. Interestingly, such activity seems to be directly correlated to the thermal stability of the mutants and inversely correlated to their propensity to self-aggregate (Tables 3 and 4) . HIV-1 gp120 has been estimated to bear 24 N-linked oligosaccharides of which 11 are high mannose (Zhang et al., 2004) . As our ITC results have shown that the binding affinity of GRFT and mGRFT for branched high-mannose oligosaccharides are essentially identical, the antiviral results argue for the conclusion that it is the crosslinking of these oligosaccharides on individual or close neighbor gp120 molecules that results in the striking antiviral activity displayed by GRFT.",

(1997) . Unlike in the case of true domain-swapped proteins, there was no previous indication of the existence of a monomeric form of this lectin, although the general fold of GRFT is the same as of the members of jacalin family (Bourne et al., 2002) . Whereas jacalin and related proteins have been shown to form oligomers, none of them make domain-swapped dimers . However, the reported dimeric nature of banana lectin (Meagher et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2005) may be related to its comparatively high antiviral activity (Swanson et al., 2010) . It has been also pointed out that other known antiviral lectins, such as CV-N (Bewley et al., 1998) and SVN (Moulaei et al., 2007) , form at least quasidimers (Botos and Wlodawer, 2005) . Domain-swapped dimers and a variety of multimeric forms have been reported for the members of the structurally unrelated b-prism-II family (Chandra et al., 1999) and served as a basis of evaluating multivalency of binding to carbohydrates, using molecular modeling (Ramachandraiah et al., 2003) . Creation of a monomeric form of GRFT was considered by us as a step in the direction of correlating the quaternary structure of the antiviral lectins with their biological activity, but the successful engineering of mGRFT also yielded an unexpected benefit of allowing a crystallographic study of a complex of this protein with the branched carbohydrate nonamannoside. The latter results form the basis of a proposed model that explains the role of multivalency of carbohydrate binding on the antiviral activity of b-prism-I family. Initial attempts at forming stable monomers of GRFT centered on stabilizing the hinge region in GRFT that provides the flexibility necessary for domain swapping, as well as on preventing hydrogen bonding between the N-terminal peptide and the body of the protein. These mutants, involving aromatic substitutions of Ser65, and sometimes additional 1-2 amino acids, did not have the desired effect and thus an alternative approach was necessary. A clue to the best way of designing mGRFT was provided by the presence of a glycol molecule in the vicinity of residues 16 and 17 0 (Zi\u00f3 lkowska et al., 2007b) , suggesting a path for their connection. Similarly to the case of an engineered Cro monomer (Albright et al., 1996) , it appeared that insertion of two or more residues into the hinge region might prevent domain swapping and result in a monomeric form of GRFT. Whereas utilization of a string consisting of five different residues (DGEVK) led to engineered monomeric Cro, it was sufficient for GRFT to insert only one or two repeats of the sequence GS, frequently found in linking regions of proteins due to its flexibility (Lubkowski et al., 1999) .",

Interestingly, both constructs were less stable than the dimeric GRFT, and several additional mutations destabilized them even further. The most telling of these additional mutations were the 1GS-S and 1GS-SDNDY forms that resulted in melting temperature of 63 and 51 C, respectively, a loss of up to 27 of thermal stability compared with GRFT. The results of the DSC studies suggest that the mutations necessary to form true monomeric GRFT result, in this instance, in a less stable protein. These studies were followed up with experiments designed to assess the effect of nonamannoside binding on the stability of both GRFT and various mGRFT mutants. As shown in Table 3 , although GRFT shows no change in stability coincident with carbohydrate binding, mGRFT showed a definite increase in thermal stability upon binding to nonamannoside. With the overall reduced thermal stability of mGRFT compared with GRFT, the increase in melting temperature upon binding nonamannoside is suggestive of conformational changes leading to such enhanced stability.",

            "text": "Not surprisingly, in isothermal titration calorimetry experiments both the monomeric and dimeric forms of GRFT exhibited similar affinity to disaccharides, pentamannoside, and virtually identical avidity of binding to the branched oligosaccharide nonamannoside. The progression of both binding enthalpies and dissociation constants indicates that both GRFT and mGRFT share similar binding interfaces to carbohydrates. What is telling, however, is the significant increase in the strength of the binding interaction when one moves from likely single-site binding interactions (i.e., mannobioses) to those that potentially involve multiple binding sites on individual GRFT monomers (e.g., pentamannoside and, to a greater degree, nonamannoside). Despite the similarity of their interactions with isolated oligosaccharides, the binding of GRFT and mGRFT to the viral envelope protein gp120 differed significantly, with the avidity of mGRFT being approximately 15-fold lower. Another major difference was observed in their antiviral properties, with GRFT exhibiting EC 50 of <0.2 nM, whereas the activity of mGRFT was reduced by three orders of magnitude under similar conditions (EC 50 of 323 nM). This observation is in agreement with the results reported for the monomeric and dimeric forms of CV-N, where the presence of at least two binding sites, whether located on a single molecule or on two molecules, was shown to be necessary to for their antiviral properties (Liu et al., 2009) . Furthermore, the activity of CV-N mutants that were inactive as monomers was restored by their dimerization (Matei et al., 2010) . However, another quasidimeric lectin, SVN, behaves in a different way, since even just its N-terminal domain (SD1) exhibits significant antiviral properties (Xiong et al., 2006) . It should be noted that several other mutants of GRFT created for this study did not show either decreased antiviral activity or true monomeric character. The antiviral assay and thermodynamic results described here detail the close association of multivalent interactions between dGRFT and gp120 with its antiviral activity. The significant reduction in the affinity of mGRFT for gp120 is mirrored by its drastic reduction in antiviral activity. The results showing that both dGRFT and mGRFT bind with similar enthalpies and dissociation constants to the Man9 analog nonamannoside indicate that the interactions between individual high mannose oligosaccharide moieties and individual monomeric units of GRFT are not sufficient to engender significant antiviral activity. It is only in the crosslinking of multiple high-mannose oligosaccharides present on gp120 when the carbohydrate-binding capabilities of lectins such as GRFT confer an antiviral effect. These results further explain our previous results which detailed the large difference in anti-HIV EC 50 values for a number of monovalent and multivalent monosaccharide-specific lectins (Zi\u00f3 lkowska et al., 2007b) .",

All previous attempts to grow crystals of the complexes of GRFT with Man9 or nonamannoside failed due to precipitation of the material from solution (T.M. and A.W., unpublished data). This was the case even when both components were mixed at very low concentration and then concentrated. These results indicate that the activity of GRFT might be compared with that of an antibody, which requires the presence of dimers in order to crosslink the antigens. Whereas the absence of such crosslinking would not influence carbohydrate binding, it would abolish the ability to interfere with viral infection. A similar explanation of the basis of antiviral activity was also recently proposed for CV-N (Matei et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "The mode of binding of nonamannoside to mGRFT seen in the crystals was quite unexpected and did not correspond fully to the previously published model of their interactions (Zi\u00f3 lkowska et al., 2007a) . The model structure assumed that the three terminal mannoses of branches D1-D3 of the nonamannoside would each occupy sites 1-3 on a GRFT monomer (as defined by , whereas the remaining mannoses would participate in only limited or no interactions. In agreement with that model, we found that in the crystals of mGRFT one nonamannoside molecule inserts its mannose 11 from the D1 branch into site 3 on the protein, whereas mannose 8, terminal in branch D2, is located in site 1. However, it is mannose 7, the second unit on the D2 branch from a symmetry-related nonamannoside molecule, that is located in site 2 of mGRFT. It is very likely that this mode of binding is a crystallization artifact, which, incidentally, must have helped in the growth of that particular crystal form of the complex. However, this fortuitous mode of binding may actually be used to explain why GRFT, at least in its dimeric form, possesses strong antiviral activity, whereas jacalin (with one binding site per monomer), or b-prism II lectins such as garlic lectin, despite their three sites, do not. A major difference between GRFT and garlic lectin is the distance between carbohydrate-binding sites on a monomer, 15 \u00c5 for the former and a minimum of 22 \u00c5 for the latter. Thus, a single molecule of nonamannoside cannot reach more than one site on the garlic lectin (Ramachandraiah et al., 2003) but can easily reach two or three on GRFT (Zi\u00f3 lkowska et al., 2007a) . If all three GRFT sites were occupied by the terminal residues of a single nonamannoside molecule, there would not be any more branches left to provide crosslinking. However, with two sites that are bound to terminal mannoses in the D1 and D2 branch offering different electrostatic properties than the third one ( Figure 4B ), the latter (and presumably weaker) site may provide an anchoring point for other nonamannosides and thus initiate crosslinking. The presence of two, almost identical, sites that can be reached by a single molecule vastly increases the avidity of binding, whereas the third site enhances crosslinking. Such organization is unique to GRFT (other lectins mentioned above either have fewer sites, or the existing sites cannot be spanned by a single complex carbohydrate molecule). With dimers allowing much more elaborate crosslinking patterns than monomers, their antiviral activity is enhanced. While highly likely, this interpretation will still require further verification through mutagenesis studies that would involve modification of the individual binding sites.",

In brief, CEM-SS cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media without phenol red and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), 2 mM L-glutamine (BioWhittaker), and 50 mg/mL gentamicin (BioWhittaker). Exponentially growing cells were washed and resuspended in medium, and a 50 ml aliquot containing 5 3 10 3 cells was added to individual wells of a 96-well round-bottom microtiter plate containing serial dilutions of GRFT, GRFT mutants, or AZT in a volume of 100 ml medium. Stock supernatants of HIV-1 RF were diluted in medium to yield sufficient cytopathicity (80%-90% cell kill in 6 days), and a 50 ml aliquot was added to appropriate wells. Plates were incubated for 6 days at 37 C, then stained for cellular viability using 2,3-bis-[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt (XTT).",
