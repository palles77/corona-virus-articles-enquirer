The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data Methods: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, timedependent recovery rate, and time-dependent mortality rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. Findings: On average, 925 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases.",

The government's strategy of communicating with the public to inform them about infection prevention is also crucial. Extra support for managing the recession is also important. However, it is not clear that other countries can implement the measures that the Chinese eventually adopted to reduce and control the incidence in the future. Extensive capacity is needed for such a level of medical care, which is a health emergency and is particularly challenging. We hope that the analytical results of this study will help to clarify important aspects of the outbreak so that the spread of coronavirus in different locations can be minimized in the shortest possible time.",

At the time of the outbreak of COVID-19, the best and most urgent steps must be taken to overcome the coronavirus epidemic. The fight against coronavirus infection should be an emergency. It can only be overcome with the active cooperation of various businesses and professions such as the medical industry, transportation, government, manufacturers of technology products, etc. (9).Several essential tasks must be done while controlling the outbreak. 1. Controlling the virus source. In the face of the virus, the most effective strategy is to keep any suspected infected patient in a relatively confined space (hospital or home) to prevent the virus from spreading.Verified patients should be treated at the hospital immediately. 2.

Along with vaccines or diagnostic tests, mathematical modeling can be a useful tool for designing strategies for prediction and designing appropriate interventions for rapid control of infectious diseases if not effectively treated. The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 8, 2020 were investigated and the prediction was made until March 29, 2020. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.Methods:A simple model of SARS and the precise prediction by Zhang et,al.(7) motivated us to use this model for Covid19. Limited laboratory kits, prolonged test results, people's lack of awareness and non-referral to medical centers led to incomplete registration of infected, suspected or dead cases in the onset days of the epidemic in Iran. In this situation, it is better to use a model with few parameters and include time-dependent rates. Suppose equation (1) includes three parameters: \u03b2(t) time-dependent transmission rate, \u03a5(t) time-dependent recovery rate, \u03bc(t) time-dependent death rate, and time-dependent infected number. The number of patients in our model is a function of time. We predict the number of patients day by day.Therefore, we use the second equation that is based on the first equation.",
