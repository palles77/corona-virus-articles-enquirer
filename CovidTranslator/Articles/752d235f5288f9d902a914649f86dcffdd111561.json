In this study, we constructed a suite of recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum with surface displaying the spike (S) protein coming from TGEV and fused with DC cells targeting peptides (DCpep) to develop an effective, safe, and convenient vaccine against transmissible gastroenteritis. Our research results found that the recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum (NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep) group expressing S fused with DCpep could not only significantly increase the percentages of MHC-II + CD80 + B cells and CD3 + CD4 + T cells but also the number of IgA + B cells and CD3 + CD4 + T cells of ileum lamina propria, which elevated the specific secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) titers in feces and IgG titers in serum. Taken together, these results suggest that NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep expressing the S of TGEV fused with DCpep could effectively induce immune responses and provide a feasible original strategy and approach for the design of TGEV vaccines.",

In 1946, Doyle and Hutchings for the first time reported TGE in the United States (Doyle and Hutchings 1946) , and it has now become a worldwide swine disease and has caused great harm to the global pig industry . TGEV is one of the main causes of piglet disease and death today. The spike (S) protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus encoded by the S gene of TGEV is located in the outermost organelles and the main antigen protein of TGEV; it carries the major B lymphocyte epitopes and is the only structural protein that induces the body to produce neutralizing antibodies and provide immunoprotection (Krimmling et al. 2017) . TGEV is also a cell-dependent viral antigen, and T cells can respond to whole virus particles and cause a cellular immune response (Chen et al. 2016) .",

The Lactobacillus plantarum NC8 strain was a strain of Lactobacillus that was isolated from grass silage in the 1980s (Axelsson et al. 2012) . Now, it is used as a model strain in the development of genetic tools, for instance, transformation, conjugation, and expression vectors (Yang et al. 2017a) .

DCpep has been considered to be a bridge between adaptive and host immunity because of its potent antigen-presenting ability and important role in inactivating and modulating the immune response (Mohamadzadeh et al. 2008) . It can effectively capture foreign antigens and autoantigens and then present them to T cells, which induce different immune responses according to the environment . Poly-\u03b3-glutamic acetase synthase A (pgsA) is a constituent protein of the polyglutamate synthetase (PGA) system of Bacillus subtilis that can act as a bacterial surface display component and stably anchor-related enzyme systems to the surface of the cell membrane (Narita et al. 2006) . Given the characteristics of the pgsA protein, it has been applied to a variety of prokaryotic protein surface displays. In particular, it has been successfully applied in Gram-positive receptor strains such as lactic acid bacteria, which provide a theoretical basis for us to study how to anchor exogenous proteins on the cell wall surface of Lactobacillus plantarum (Lei et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017c) .",

Groups were housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment. The piglets of the same group were placed in a uniform environment; however, they were separated into rooms and fed a balanced diet with free access to water. The piglets were administered orally with 5 ml saline, 10 10 CFU NC8-pSIP409-pgsA, 10 10 CFU NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-Ctrlpep, 10 10 CFU NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep, and 2 ml inactivated TGEV, respectively, approximately twice at 7-day intervals.

The blood samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight without shaking and then centrifuged at 4\u00b0C and 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the serum was obtained and stored at 80\u00b0C for subsequent analysis. The feces were collected as previously published . The piglets were handled and maintained under strict ethical conditions according to international recommendations for animal welfare. All group piglets were euthanized at 21 days after secondary immunization, and the intestinal segments were collected as previously described but with minor alterations (Zhao et al. 2014) . In detail, upon washing with ice-cold PBS, the fixed tissues were immediately embedded in OCT (embedding medium for frozen tissue specimens; Sakura, USA) and then stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until further use. Frozen tissue sections (5 \u03bcm thick) were cut on a frozen slicer (Leica CM 3050S cryostat, Germany) and transferred to poly-L-lysine-coated microscope slides. The slides were air-dried and stored for up to 4 weeks at \u2212 80\u00b0C before immunofluorescence staining.

            "text": "Lactobacillus plantarum is a well-characterized bacterium that is a particularly popular probiotic used to express heterogeneous proteins and deliver targeted antigens . In a previous research report, due to the use of the intracellular expression vector pSIP409 to express target antigens aiming to protect against Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the research results did not achieve the expected results (Jiang et al. 2015) . To overcome these hurdles, as a powerful technology, surface display may be a good choice to express heterogeneous peptides and proteins on cells, making use of natural functional components of microorganisms (Raha et al. 2005; Kuczkowska et al. 2016 ). Poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid synthetase A (pgsA), which is a constituent protein of the polyglutamate synthetase system (PGA) of Bacillus subtilis, has been widely used to anchor foreigner protective antigens on the surface of lactic acid bacteria (Sewaki 2010; Lei et al. 2015) . In previous studies, we successfully used surface display technology to express a number of targeted proteins, such as hemagglutinin subunit 2 (HA2) of avian influenza virus (AIV), and murine IL-10 and spike protein (S) of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Cai et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2017 ). Because DC targeting strategies could stimulate stronger and lasting immune responses, they have attracted the eyes of an increasing number of people. In the present study, to reduce the number of vaccinations of L. plantarum, which served as oral administration, the specific 12-mer DC-binding peptides were utilized to target DCs from the bacteriophage library. Previous studies have found that anthrax PA or hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3, which genetically fused DC-binding peptides, could efficiently deliver antigens to DCs (Shao-Hua et al. 2016) . In previous reports, this vaccine strategy offered a variety of benefits in that the constructed L. plantarum expression of protein-fused DCpep could activate mucosal DCs, B cells, and T cells to induce the immunological response and could regulate inflammatory responses that took place in a mucosal microenvironment (Steinman and Idoyaga 2010) . Our laboratory has previously studied Yang et al. 2016 ) the effects of recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing target antigens and DCpep on MHC-II + CD80 + DCs; however, the impact of recombinant lactic acid bacteria cells has not been studied in MHC-II + CD80 + B (such cells not only can secrete SIgA involved in mucosal immunity but also can act as antigen-presenting cells) (Adler et al. 2017; Mizoguchi and Bhan 2017) . Therefore, in this study, we mainly researched the effects of recombinant lactic acid bacteria NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep expressing DCpep and target antigen S protein on MHC-II + CD80 + B cells, CD3 + CD4 + cells related to mucosal immune responses, and anti-TGEVspecific antibodies. In this study, the results showed that the recombinant lactic acid bacteria NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep could raise not only the rate of MHC-II + CD80 + B cells in PPs and spleens by flow cytometry but also the number IgA + B cells in ileum lamina propria by immunofluorescence and T cells in the mesentery by flow cytometry (Figs. 3, 4, and  7) . This research also showed that NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep could increase S-specific SIgA antibody titers in fecal matter to produce mucosal immune responses and S-specific IgG antibody titers in serum to produce humoral immune responses by ELISA analysis (Fig. 5) .",

It has been considered that CD3 + CD4 + T cells serving as a type of T-helper cells could promote other immune cells to mature and activate by secreting a variety of cytokines. The primary liability of the significant production of mucosal SIgA in the NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep group should be borne by observed T-cell expansion. This may be the cause for recombinant lactic acid bacteria NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep expressing DCpep and target antigens S protein being able to better assist recombinant antigen-induced dendritic cell proliferation and activation in piglets in vivo. DCs captured the DCpep binding targeted antigen S protein and then presented the antigens to T cells; by secreting cytokines, Th cells activated the B cells .",

            "text": "IFN-\u03b3, which is a cytokine, could enhance phagocytic activity to efficiently kill pathogens and is produced by NK cells and T lymphocytes. It was reported that IFN-\u03b3 could cause Th1 responses to protect against pathogen infection by adjusting chemotaxis and enhancing antigen presentation (Schroder et al. 2004 ). IL-4 promotes the expression of MHC-II and CD40 in B cells and enhances the ability of B cells to present antigen so that the immune system can produce an immune response to antigen stimulation. The Th1 and Th2 cell responses are related to the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, respectively. As a consequence, in this study, the secretion levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 were analyzed in the immunized animals to indirectly reflect the capacity of the vaccine to induce the Th1 or Th2 response. In addition, the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses was evaluated by the secretion levels of these cytokines (Chen et al. 2010) . In this study, compared to the saline control group in the piglets, we found that NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep could significantly induce the secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, indicating that NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep significantly heightened the immunogenicity of the TGEV vaccine and triggered the immune response of Th1-and Th2-type cells (Fig. 9) . The results also suggested that NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep administered orally to piglets had a powerful potentiation influence on both humoral and cellular immunity. A previous study showed that oral administration of Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 notably heightened not only the production of Th1-type cytokines in serum but also specific SIgA antibody responses to influenza (Olivares et al. 2007 ). The increased percentages of IL-4-secreting Th2 cells then possibly stimulated the differentiation of IgA + B cells and increased production of mucosal SIgA antibodies. In addition, the primary function of Th2 cells is to induce B-cell proliferation and produce antibodies that are related to humoral immunity. It was reported that IL-17 has significant functions that participate in pro-and anti-inflammatory effects . Previous research showed that recombinant Lactobacillus induced the expression of IL-17 in both systemic and mucosal immune responses to protect against TGEV infection (Jiang et al. 2014) . Similarly, in this study, we found that piglets immunized with NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep could remarkably induce the expression of IL-17 in spleen cells (systematic immune responses) and mesenteric lymph node cells (mucosal immune responses) compared with other groups (Fig. 9 ). Regulatory T (Treg) cells take part in the regulation of anti-inflammatory responses primarily through the secretion of cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 (Noack and Miossec 2014) . Previous studies have found that the oral administration of Lactobacillus casei can increase the expression of TGF-\u03b2 in blood, and this is essential for Th17 differentiation in the spleen (Jiang et al. 2014) .",

There was a report that compared with the vaccinated group, which was not colonized in piglets, the vaccinated probiotic colonized in piglets dramatically increased small intestinal TLR9 expression (Vlasova et al. 2013) . TLR9 recognizes bacterial CpG motifs and the higher expression of TLR9 coming from MNCs was very important for mucosal IgA to participate in the immune response. A previous study showed that toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an important role in the activation of DCs using recombinant Lactobacillus (Kathania et al. 2013) . Recombinant Lactobacillus has been reported to serve as a vaccine to effectively inhibit the expression of TLR in piglets . However, in this study, we also evaluated the expression of TLR-2 and TLR-9 in piglets immunized with recombinant L. plantarum by real-time RT-PCR analysis and found that recombinant L. plantarum could increase the number of TLR-2 and TLR-9 expression in pigs to stimulate the host mucosal immune system (Fig. 2) . It is likely that lactobacilli induced the expression of TLR-2 and TLR-9, which is related to the higher lactobacilli quantity (Wen et al. 2009 ). It is well known that the expression levels of cytokines and TLR in splenic lymphocytes are indicators of systemic immunity, but the expression of cytokines and TLR in the cells coming from MLNs is concerned with local and mucosal immune responses. BAFF and APRIL are usually secreted by not only monocytes and intestinal epithelial cells but also T cells (Fagarasan et al. 2010 ). BAFF has a strong B-cell chemotaxis and can induce activated B cells to secrete large amounts of IgG, IgA, and IgM as costimulatory factors for B-cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro, which can help the immature B cells of peripheral blood survive and differentiate into mature B cells in vivo (Boneparth and Davidson 2012) . A previous study showed that piglets colonized by Lactobacillus rhamnosus showed that probiotic treatment enhanced the expression of APRIL in the gut but had no influence on the expression of BAFF in MNCs compared with control groups (Kandasamy et al. 2014) . In this study, we found that recombinant lactic acid bacteria NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep also boosted APRIL and BAFF expression in the gut (Fig. 9) . A previous study reported that the CD40-CD40L and CD28-CD80 pathways are essential for the activation of T cells and activation of polyclonal B cells (Tokunaga et al. 2005) . This research also found that recombinant lactic acid bacteria NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep could improve the expression of CD40 and CD80/CD86 (Fig. 3) . The above results provided a reason for why NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep could enhance the number of IgA + B cells and CD3 + CD4 + T cells in the ILP.",

            "text": "It is well known that the mucosal immune response is considered the first barrier function to neutralize viruses, including TGEV. Previous research studies have already demonstrated that SIgA participates in the response protecting against disease at mucosal surfaces (Liu et al. 2011) . SIgA agglutinates and incapacitates pathogens, by which it inhibits pathogen adhesion to the mucosal surface and is easily cleared in the secretions. Therefore, SIgA disenables pathogens to interact with epithelial cell receptors and inhibits the assembly of viral particles within the host cell cytoplasm (Kurashima and Kiyono 2017) . Recombinant lactic acid bacteria can induce the production of SIgA in the intestines. In our research, we found that recombinant Lactobacillus NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep could significantly increase the titer of anti-TGEV SIgA in feces and anti-TGEV IgG titer in the serum of piglets after oral immunization, comparing the different versions of NC8-pSIP409-pgsA, NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-Ctrlpep, and NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep (Fig. 5 ). In addition, it is worth noting that the levels of specific antibodies induced by NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep could continue 28 days at a high level. This may be related to Lactobacillus colonization in the intestinal tract. Comparing the different versions of NC8-pSIP409-pgsA, NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-Ctrlpep, NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep, and TGEV inactivated vaccines, upon immunization, we also found that NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep triggered expected immune responses between B and T cells, and as expected, the expression of SIgA was higher and continual. In addition, it has been shown that lymphocyte proliferation occurs in the ileum lamina propria of piglets immunized with an oral dose of recombinant L. plantarum. It was further suggested that recombinant Lactobacillus could induce mucosal immune responses in piglets. In summary, all results recommended that the NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep expressing the S of TGEV fused with DCpep could effectively induce immune responses, including mucosal immune and systemic immune responses.",

Furthermore, NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep could significantly raise not only the specific SIgA titers in feces but also IgG titers in serum. The NC8-pSIP409-pgsA-S-DCpep provided a feasible original strategy and approach for the design of TGEV vaccines. Fig. 9 Analysis of the expression of cytokines. The levels of cytokines IL-4 (a) and IFN-\u03b3 (b) in serum were detected by respective ELISA kits.
