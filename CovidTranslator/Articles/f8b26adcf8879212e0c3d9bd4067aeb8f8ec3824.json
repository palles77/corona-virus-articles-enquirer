We present a simple approach to assess disease seriousness, creating a reference cohort of pneumonia patients from sentinel hospitals. First comparisons exposed a higher rate of COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation. There were more case fatalities among COVID-19 patients without comorbidities than in the reference cohort. Hospitals should prepare for high utilisation of ventilation and intensive care resources.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline on Pandemic Influenza Severity Assessment, severity indicators would be transmissibility, disease seriousness and impact [1] . Transmissibility reflects the movement of the virus, which is influenced by the dynamics of the spread, the R 0 and the susceptibility of the exposed population. So far, several estimates on R 0 exist, ranging between 1.4 to 6.49, which indicate a higher transmissibility than seasonal influenza, and even higher than SARS-CoV [2] . Impact reflects the impact on the healthcare sector, such as capacity utilisation of general practitioners, hospitals and public health authorities, and on society. Given the current data, the impact in countries other than China is hard to assess, although potentially high [3, 4] . Disease seriousness reflects the extent of individual sickness including clinical symptoms, complications and outcomes. Recent publications from the area first affected in China (the city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei) offer valuable, although preliminary, data such as the proportion of hospitalised coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients treated in intensive care units (ICU), ventilated or deceased. These are important parameters for the assessment of individual disease seriousness. However, a challenge is to apply these data to the situation in Europe, given the different population structures and comorbidities.",

We defined a reference group from a well-known setting: in 73 German sentinel hospitals, we extracted the data of all inpatients diagnosed with pneumonia (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes J12-J18, primary diagnosis [13] ) that were admitted during three consecutive weeks, after the start and before the peak of the influenza epidemic in the years 2015 to 2019. We compared severity parameters that were described for COVID-19 patients (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ventilation, intensive care, case fatality) with those from the German sentinel system. Furthermore, we stratified parameters by potential risk groups such as age, sex and chronic comorbidities. We also compared outcomes and risk factors for critically ill patients (i.e. received intensive care and ventilation) [14] . As the Chinese population is younger, with a larger proportion of males compared with the German population, we applied weights and provided crude and adjusted proportions for the sentinel pneumonia patients (SPP) [15] . This approach, which can be used by other countries using syndromic surveillance, attempts to replicate the uncertainty of initial results for the new coronavirus.",

This may have inhibited adequate treatment as the strikingly higher case fatality indicates [18] .

As more data on European cases are published, the system can be applied to cases with a more comparable background. First comparisons expose the high rate of patients requiring ventilation over prolonged time periods, thus hospital resources may be in higher demand of ventilation supply than usual. In fact, Liu et al. suggests that early non-invasive mechanical ventilation can promote positive outcomes [9] . This can only be implemented if hospitals prepare for high utilisation of ventilation and intensive care resources. Although fatalities occur mostly among elderly people with chronic comorbidities, serious disease progressions do also occur among younger, healthy patients and more often than would be expected from the experience during influenza epidemics.",
