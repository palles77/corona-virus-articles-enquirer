Anti-N MAbs immunoprecipitated a 48 K protein derived from both P 115 and M 6 infected cell lysates, and a 44 K protein was co-immunoprecipitated mainly from P 115 infected cell lysates. The same finding was noted when three of the four hyperimmune porcine sera were tested. This unique 44 K protein has not been reported by other Siao-Kun Wan Welch and Linda J. Saif researchers. One explanation may be that the percentage of cross-linker in our gel system was different from others; therefore, the resolution for the 44 K protein was better. Our results suggest that although this 44 K protein occurs in both P 115 and M 6 infected cells and was detected by hyperimmune sera and MAbs produced against virulent TGEV, it accumulates more in the P 115 infected cells.

[8] . Whether this 14K protein is an intrinsic protein for only Purdue attenuated TGEV or a cleavage product of E 2 is not yet known. Nevertheless, this protein was not immunoprecipitated by the MAbs or the four hyperimmune swine sera. The four MAbs which had low neutralizing antibody activity, showed high background and low intensity reactions in RIP and were reported as unclassified MAbs which may possibly be E 1-specific. Additional tests are required to confirm their protein specificities using either more extensive absorption methods or a solid phase immunoisolation technique [20] .",

It is possible some anti-E 1 MAbs may inactivate TGEV infectivity via complement-mediated virolysis. Interestingly, all four unclassified MAbs (which may react with E 1 protein) produced in the present study had low to moderate virus neutralizing antibody titers, but the neutralizing activities were not enhanced in the presence of 4 hemolytic units/ml of swine complement (data not shown).

Immunofluorescence patterns in TGEV-infected cells reacted with E 2-specific MAbs suggest that E 2 proteins are produced mainly in the cell perinuclear regions. Anti-N MAbs produced bright cytplasmic particulate immunofluorescence in TGEV-infected ST cells suggesting that N proteins are abundant in cytoplasm and often in aggregates reflected by the particulate nature of the fluorescence. In the case of the four unclassified MAbs, fewer immunofluorescent TGEV-infected ST cells were evident (although all cells were infected with the same m.o.i.) and fluorescence on the cell surface was more distinct around cell to cell junctions. Laude et al. [12] demonstrated 3 similar fluorescence patterns. However the membrane fluorescence was shown in paraformaldehyde-fixed cells reacted with an anti-E 2 MAb and a fluorescence pattern for anti-E 1 MAbs was not identified.",

Using MAbs to Purdue TGEV in competitive assays, Delmas et al. [3] demonstrated that the neutralization mediating determinants were highly conserved among TGEV strains. Furthermore, Jimenez et al. [9] showed that neutralizing epitopes on attenuated TGE virus were conformational and highly conserved. Our data suggest differences exist between a virulent and attenuated strain of TGEV, perhaps in the density of certain epitopes expressed on the viruses, or the proteins they elicit in infected cells. First, neutralizing antibody titers of unclassified MAbs 1 H 8 and 13 D 8 and anti-E 2 MAb 25 E 4 were 72, 9 and 13-fold higher respectively, to M 6 than P 115 TGEV. Second, anti-E 2 MAb 25 H 4 had a 4-fold higher neutralizing antibody titer to P 115 than to M 6. Third, all anti-N and anti-E 2 MAbs had 4 to 16-fold higher CCIF titers to M 6 than P 115. Furthermore, fluorescence intensity was stronger against the M 6 strain than P 115 strain of TGEV. Finally, differences in the relative mol. wt. of E 1 and E 2 proteins and in the quantity of the 44 K protein between the virulent and attenuated TGEV strains, imply that phenotypic variation between the 2 strains may exist. This has not been reported previously.",
