Cartilage differentiation and chondrocyte maturation are required for normal skeletal development, but the intracellular pathways regulating this process remain largely unclear. This study was designed to identify novel genes that might help clarify the molecular mechanisms of chondrogenesis. Chondrogenesis was induced by culturing human bone marrow (BM) derived MSCs in micromass pellets in the presence of defined medium for 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Several genes regulated during chondrogenesis were then identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using an ABI microarray system, we determined the differential gene expression profiles of differentiated chondrocytes and BM-MSCs. Normalization of this data resulted in the identification of 1,486 differentially expressed genes. To verify gene expression profiles determined by microarray analysis, the expression levels of 10 genes with high fold changes were confirmed by RT-PCR. Gene expression patterns of 9 genes (Hrad6B, annexinA2, BMP-7, contactin-1, peroxiredoxin-1, heat shock transcription factor-2, synaptotagmin IV, serotonin receptor-7, Axl) in RT-PCR were similar to the microarray gene expression patterns. These findings provide novel information concerning genes involved in the chondrogenesis of human BM-MSCs.",

MSCs isolated from bone marrow (BM) and expanded in vitro in their undifferentiated phenotype, retain an extensive capacity for multi-lineage differentiation into chondrocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts, and tenocytes under appropriate environmental cues (2) . The presence of specific, distinct antigens identified by the monoclonal antibodies SH2, SH3, and SH4, on the surfaces of marrow-derived MSCs, that are not present on osteocytes and osteoblasts, suggests that these epitopes are developmentally regulated. The antigen which bound to SH2 antibody was identified as endoglin (CD105), a receptor for TGF-\u03b23, which potentially plays a role in mediating the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and in their interactions with hematopoietic cells (3) .",

Annexins bind to negatively charged phos- pholipids in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner and have a conserved structure. The human annexin, annexin A2 (alternative names: annexin II, p36, and lipocortin II) is expressed abundantly in various human organs, including the placenta, lungs, heart, and liver (19) . At the cellular level, annexin A2 is expressed on endothelial cell surfaces and acts as a co-receptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (20) . Furthermore, annexins are commonly dysregulated in cancer (21) and annexin A2 is upregulated in a variety of tumors and cancer cell lines (22, 23) . Contactin-1 is a cell surface adhesion molecule, which is normally expressed by neurons, oligodendrocytes, and human astrocytic gliomas (24, 25) . Previous studies have reported that MSCs express IL-15, essential hematopoietic growth factor (26, 27) and IL-15 is also a potent apoptosis inhibitor and has many immunomodulatory activities (28) . The Serotonin receptor 7 is the most recently identified member of the serotonin receptor family and is found in brain, mainly in the hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex (29) .",
