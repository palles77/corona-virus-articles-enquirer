            "text": "Recent outbreaks of emerging infections, caused by viruses such as Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Coronavirus, and Zika Virus, represent a global threat and emphasize the critical need for new vaccine concepts and vectors and for rapid clinical development. However, predicting and achieving vaccine efficacy remains a major challenge in the acceleration of vaccine development. Systems vaccinology approaches can assist with the identification of early immune signatures predictive of vaccine immunogenicity (Pulendran et al., 2010) . Previous studies have investigated the potential of early innate immune signatures to predict the antibody response to vaccines, such as the yellow fever or influenza vaccines (Nakaya et al., 2011; Querec et al., 2009; Gaucher et al., 2008; Furman et al., 2013) , among others (Li et al., 2014) , but it remains unknown whether molecular signatures can be identified that can be used to predict immune responses to novel vaccines. Here we applied a systems vaccinology approach to disentangle the early innate immune responses elicited by the Ebola vaccine rVSV-Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) to identify innate immune responses correlating with Ebola virus (EBOV)-glycoprotein (GP)specific antibody induction. This replication-competent recombinant vaccine candidate is based on the vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine vector, for which limited data on immune responses and no innate immunity profiles in humans have been reported thus far. rVSV-ZEBOV represents one of the most promising Ebola vaccine candidates to date, with anticipated licensure expected soon. This vaccine has shown to be protective in relevant EBOV animal challenge models, including nonhuman primates (NHPs), where it conferred 100% protection (Jones et al., 2005; Qiu et al., 2009; Geisbert et al., 2008 Geisbert et al., ,2009 . Furthermore, it is the only EBOV candidate vaccine for which an efficacy evaluation against the risk of infection in humans was possible. A cluster-randomized ring vaccination trial conducted in Guinea in 2015 showed promising results, demonstrating that a strategy of contact tracing and immediate ring vaccination of contacts with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine protects against Ebola virus disease compared with controls (Henao-Restrepo et al., 2017) . While this ring vaccination trial was focused on clinical endpoints only and did not assess immune responses induced by the vaccine, the safety and immunogenicity of vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV were evaluated in 2014-2015 in a number of investigator-initiated dose-escalation phase 1 clinical trials coordinated through a World Health Organization (WHO)-led African and European VSV-Ebola Consortium (VEBCON), which informed dose selection for the efficacy trials. These harmonized but independent investigatorinitiated phase I trials were completed in 2015 and took place at four different international sites, including the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in Germany (Agnandji et al., 2016) . In these trials, vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV was shown to be immunogenic and induced GP-specific antibodies in all participants (Agnandji et al., 2016) . However, the immunological mechanisms leading to antibody induction, in particular the role of early innate immune responses to this vaccine vector, remain to be elucidated.",

Because human data on the recombinant VSV vaccine platform are scarce, our study makes important contributions to the understanding of the immunological properties of this vaccine in humans and may provide unique insights for future use of this vector technology in emergency vaccines, including candidate vaccines currently in development against Zika virus (Betancourt et al., 2017) .",

Plasma was isolated on days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 after vaccination and analyzed for concentration levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-12 p70, IL-10, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), interferon-g (IFN-g), IFN-a, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), TNF-b, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1a), MIP-1b, monocytechemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and IP-10 using a Luminex assay. The respective cytokines were selected based on their reported roles in orchestrating host immune responses to vaccines (Querec et al., 2009; Nakaya et al., 2011; Barouch et al., 2013; Teigler et al., 2012) . The vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV induced a rapid and robust increase in cytokine levels, with a maximum peak as early as day 1. Significant increases in concentration levels were noted for IP-10 (CXCL-10) on days 1 and 3 and for MCP-1 and MIP-1b on day 1 relative to their expression on day 0 (Wilcoxon signedrank test, false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p < 0.001 for each cytokine; Figures 1A and 1B) . Cytokine levels of MCP-1 and IP-10 were vaccine dose-dependent, with the highest levels observed in higher vaccine dose group 2 receiving 20 3 10 6 plaque-forming units (PFUs) compared with the lower dose group receiving 3 3 10 6 PFUs (Wilcoxon rank-sum test for betweengroup comparison on day 1; FDR-adjusted p = 0.003 and 0.048, respectively; Figure 1C ). The remaining 10 cytokines had concentration levels below the range of the standard curve in >50% of the measurements at several time points, and no statistical analyses were performed on these cytokines. Altogether, we show here that rVSV-ZEBOV leads to a significant and early induction of the cytokines IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP-1b, with maximum plasma peak levels on day 1 after vaccination.",

Vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV led to a strong and early induction of a wide spectrum of activating molecules and upregulation of costimulatory molecules on both antigen-presenting cells (monocytes and DCs) and NK cells ( Figure 2 ). Significant modulations were seen in the frequency of CD86+/CD40+ mDCs and pDCs as well as CD16+ inflammatory monocytes, accompanied by an increase in the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD40 on pDCs and CD86 on mDCs. Analysis also revealed significant upregulation of several activation markers on NK cells, including NKG2D and CD38 (Figure 2 ). The entire spectrum of assessed innate surface markers is shown in Table S1 . The kinetics of surface marker expression and frequency differed among the distinct cell subsets, with peak values either reached by day 1 or day 3 following vaccination (Table S1) . For all markers, frequency and surface expression declined again following day 3 after vaccination ( Figure 2 ; Table S1 ).",

Given the high number of predictor variables (435 early innate immune marker variables across day 0, day 1, and day 3) and the small sample size (20 trial participants), we took advantage of the full spectrum of antibody response measurements between day 28 and day 180 to increase the amount of response information in the model using sparse partial least-squares (sPLS). Cross-validated down-selection resulted in a single sPLS component including five early innate markers as correlates of the later antibody responses (with 49%-67% of the variance of each of the five antibody response measurements explained; Table S2 ).

            "text": "Longitudinal assessment of early innate immune responses showed a strong and early activation of innate immune responses as early as day 1 after vaccination. IP-10, MIP-1b, and MCP-1 were significantly induced by day 1 after vaccination, with dose-dependent peak levels of MCP-1 and IP-10. Increase The matrix shows positive correlations with the corresponding antibody responses in blue and negative correlations in red. The stronger the intensity of the color, the stronger is the correlation. See also Figure S1 , Tables S2 and S3, and Table S4. in IP-10 levels after vaccination has also been reported in previous studies investigating immune responses to the yellow fever vaccine (Querec et al., 2009) and the inactivated trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) (Nakaya et al., 2011) . However, these studies did not include an analysis of any immune changes as early as day 1 and reported peak levels of cytokine levels on day 3 following vaccination. It therefore remains unclear whether the true peak was missed or is indeed reached at a later time point in these studies because dynamics of cytokine expression may depend on the vaccine or vector being used. In line with previous results of the aforementioned vaccine studies, we also observed a strong increase in the frequency of CD16+ inflammatory monocytes and CD86+ DCs and monocytes. We found peak expression to be reached as early as day 3 in our studies compared with day 7, as reported for the yellow fever vaccine (Querec et al., 2009) , indicating that dynamics in surface marker expression on innate immune cells may indeed depend on the specific vaccine being tested. Changes in frequency or expression of further activating markers on antigen-presenting cells, as revealed by our study, have not been reported before. Particularly, changes in frequency and phenotype of NK cells following vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV in humans have not been described in any previous vaccine study. Our data thus provide insights into the full picture of early vaccine-induced key mediators involved in the innate immune response to vaccination. NK cells have previously been suggested as critical players in the mediation of early protection against Ebola infection in NHPs; Marzi et al. (2015) showed that vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV protected macaques against a lethal challenge with the West African EBOV-Makona strain. Intriguingly, complete and partial protection was achieved with a single dose given as late as 7 or 3 days before challenge, respectively, even before an adaptive antibody response had been developed (Marzi et al., 2015) . Thus, Marzi et al. (2015) implicated a role for NK cells in conferring this early-induced protection after vaccination because the cytokine signature induced by the vaccine was highly suggestive of NK cell activation, eventually resulting in NK cell-mediated killing of virus-infected cells. Their findings suggest that vaccination-induced activation of NK cells could contribute to control of EBOV replication before specific antibody responses have developed. Furthermore, NK cells have also been implicated in survival of EBOV infections, showing a decisive role for NK cells during lethal Ebola virus infection (Feldmann et al., 2007; Warfield et al., 2004) . In the present study, MFI of CXCR6 on CD56 dim NK cells and frequency of CD56 bright NK cells were identified as positive correlates of the GP-specific antibody response, supporting the role of NK cells in shaping subsequent adaptive immunity. CXCR6, a member of the seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled chemokine receptor (CKR) family was shown to act as a chemokinetrafficking molecule and is indispensable for persistence of NK cell memory of haptens and viruses in animal models (Shimaoka et al., 2000; Paust and von Andrian, 2011; Paust et al., 2010) . Future studies should explore whether these markers display a functional role in vaccine-induced generation of antibody responses.",

CD86 is a costimulatory molecule that provides key signals required for T cell activation (Fanslow et al., 1994; Lu et al., 1996; Sansom et al., 2003) . A negative effect of vaccine-induced inflammatory monocytes on T cell proliferation and antibody production has been reported previously in mice (Mitchell et al., 2012) . Here, vaccination-induced inflammation, although necessary for effective immunity, also generated strong counter-regulatory immune responses that were mediated primarily by inflammatory monocytes through suppression of T cell responses. It was demonstrated that suppression of T cell help eventually led to reduced antibody titers in vaccinated mice, implicating a potential role for inhibition of monocyte-mediated inhibitory responses as an effective strategy for enhancing vaccine immunity. Because DCs share many features with monocytes as antigen-presenting cells, a counter-regulatory effect on the adaptive immune responses elicited by these cells may also be arguable but has yet to be demonstrated. Taken together, these data suggest that activated (inflammatory) monocytes have a negative effect on the generation of GP-specific antibody responses, reflecting a counter-regulatory, suppressive effect of these antigen-presenting cells on the development of adaptive immune responses.",

IP-10 is one of the most potent cytokines secreted from monocytes and DCs (Dufour et al., 2002) . It is secreted from cells stimulated with type I and II IFNs and is a strong chemoattractant for activated T cells. IP-10 can generate and amplify antitumor immunity through recruitment of antigen-specific T cells to antigen-presenting DCs in draining lymph nodes (Christensen et al., 2006) . Interestingly, studies have shown that, when linked to a model tumor antigen, IP-10 can increase tumor antigen-specific T cell immune responses in mice because of both enhanced antigen presentation and chemoattraction, thus enhancing vaccine potency (Kang et al., 2011) . It has also been demonstrated that, in the setting of DC-based tumor vaccines, modification of the vaccine through addition of IP-10 generated more tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and stronger anti-tumor effects in vaccinated mice compared with the control group (Kang et al., 2009 (Kang et al., , 2011 . Furthermore, next-generation RNA sequencing revealed dose-dependent differential gene expression on day 1 or 3 after vaccination with CXCL10, the gene encoding for IP-10, among the 10 genes with the largest fold changes. The gene signature identified through RNA sequencing correlated with the later antibody responses and included TIFA on day 1, which is related to the IP-10 pathway. This analysis was performed in an unbiased way, not influenced by the results from markers identified through cytokine/chemokine and flow cytometry analyses.",

The final sPLS model was selected through cross-validated mean squared error of prediction (MSEP() and proportion of explained variance, whereas final multivariable linear regression models were selected using cross-validated RSR as well as a goodness-of-fit criterion (adjusted coefficient of determination, R 2 ). All variables were centered and reduced for sPLS analyses, whereas original variables were used in the multivariable linear model (for interpretation in their biological measurement units). Missing values were imputed (among the four cell populations finally selected by sPLS, this only concerns CXCR6 for one participant).",
