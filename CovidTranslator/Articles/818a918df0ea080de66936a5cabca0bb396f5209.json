The cells grew and secreted mAb stably. Antibody titers in the culture supernatant and ascites were 2.048 \u00c210 6 and 4.096 \u00c210 6 , respectively. By applying the anti-HBs G6 mAb and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-HBs antibody, we developed a sandwich ELISA (defined G6m ELISA) for detecting both wild-type and immune escape mutant HBsAgs (IEM HBsAg). The assay was performed to detect 17 species of genome recombinant expression HBsAg, including two wild-type species and 15 IEM HBsAg species, which varied in the \"a\" determinant, in a group of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The patients previously had a lower ELISA detection signal [(absorbance of patients/absorbance of normal people (P/N): 1.0-4.5)]. The results demonstrated that the sensitivity of this assay to wild-type HBsAg was no less than 0.125 \u03bcg/L; 12 of 15 IEM HBsAg species (P/N\u22652.5) were positive for G6 mAb. Of the positive IEM HBsAg species, two had a low absorbance value at 450 nm (A 450 ), one had an intermediate A 450 value and nine had a high A 450 value, which was 7.55%(mean), 59.4% and 92.1%-109.4% of the wild-type A 450 value, respectively. The two species with low A 450 value and the three negative species mutated at the bases 120-124 in the first loop of the HBV \"a\" determinant. Using the G6 ELISA and two commercial ELISA kits (A and B), 177 patients were tested. The G6 ELISA had a significantly higher detection rate than either commercial ELISAs (19.21% vs 14.89% and 6.21%, respectively; P < 0.01, P < 0.05, respectively).",

            "text": "The ongoing epidemic of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most serious public health issues in the world [1, 2] . As the virus polymerase enzyme lacks proofreading activity, it is likely to have a much higher mutation frequency than the polymerases of other DNA viruses [3, 4] . When mutations develop in some specific gene regions, such as the \"a\" determinant, a shift can occur in the expressed hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which can result in an HBV immune escape mutant strain (HBV IEMS) [1, 4] . Many researchers have demonstrated that the immune escape mutant of HBV (IEM HBV) is similar to wild-type HBV in both pathogenesis and infectivity [5] [6] [7] . Because the mutant virus cannot be neutralized by the protective antibodies already circulating in the body and most commercial kits cannot detect it, it is possible that clinical misdiagnoses can be given to infectious HBV patients and both blood donor screening and serum epidemiology investigations become unreliable. As a result, this problem has attracted much attention [6, [8] [9] [10] . Our group has begun to investigate this phenomenon that goes back to the last century. A new monoclonal antibody (mAb)producing cell line (anti-HBs G6 mAb) has demonstrated a strong capacity for combining with mass IEM HBsAg. In this study, we primarily evaluated the binding ability of this mAb with the HBV mutant in the \"a\" determinant.",

The methods, positive rate and positive coverage of the detections are various, and the clinical significances are also different [19] [20] [21] [22] . Since the early 1990s, many researchers have studied the difficulties in the detection of IEM HBsAg. They attempted to increase the clinical detection rate of HBsAg using kits coated with polyclonal antibodies, high-affinity antibodies against the non \"a\" determinant of HBsAg or a group of mAb against the \"a\" determinants of different IEM HBsAgs to prevent common health problems caused by false-negative diagnoses of the HBV infection [20] [21] [22] . Since 2000, many domestic ELISA kits have been able to detect IEM HBsAg to some degrees. However, detection products that have similar detection rates as Abbott chemiluminescence are not available. We attempted to prepare an mAb for the reliable clinical diagnosis of HBV infection and obtained one hybridoma cell line that secreted an anti-HBsAg antibody named \"G6\". Systematic assessments demonstrated that this cell line could secrete an antibody with high efficiency and the secreted antibody was equal to or better in specificity and affinity than the corresponding antibody in the currently available commercial kits. The sensitivity of G6 ELISA was no less than 0.125 ng/mL based on its ability to detect the wild-type HBsAg.",

The results were verified by our study.

Anti-HBs G6 mAb could block the reactions of anti-HBs A11 and anti-HBs Mt with r-wHBsAg, but the degree of blocking was limited, and its ability to block anti-HBs A11 was lower than the latter, suggesting that the corresponding antigen determinant of anti-HBs G6 mAb was independent of anti-HBs A11 and anti-HBs Mt mAb in the primary structure. In addition, it suggested that there was a significantly larger spatial distance between the corresponding antigen determinants of anti-HBs G6 mAb and anti-HBs A11 mAb than that of anti-HBs G6 mAb and anti-HBs MT mAb. Because the specificity of the anti-HBs A11 mAb to the \"a\" determinant (or the nearby sites) of HBsAg is most definite, we conclude that there exists some distance in the amino acid sequence between the corresponding antigen determinant of anti-HBs G6 mAb and the HBsAg \"a\" determinant.",

The results demonstrated that G6 ELISA and commercial ELISA kits B and C had similar sensitivities (0.125, 0.25 and 0.125 ng/mL, respectively), and the positive rate was 19.21% (34/177 cases), 6.21% and 14.89%, respectively. The negative serum was correctly identified by the G6 ELISA and the two commercial ELISA kits. Together, these data indicate that the G6 ELISA has a stronger capability to detect HBsAg than the commercial ELISA kits. The G6 mAb had a strong sensitivity for wild-type HBsAg (0.125 ng/mL), same as the commercial ELISA kits; its blocking efficiency against G145R HBsAg was greater than that against wild-type HBsAg when coated with the anti-HBs Mt mAb (Table 3) ; it detected more IEM HBsAgs and its ELISA signal intensity was stronger than the tested commercial ELISA kits and/or anti-HBs mAbs (Tables 2 and 3 ), and we presume that the sera were detected as HBsAg positive only by using the G6 ELISA containing IEM HBV. The recent studies by Ijaz and Louisirirotchanakul et al have also provided some clinical evidence [29, 30] .",
