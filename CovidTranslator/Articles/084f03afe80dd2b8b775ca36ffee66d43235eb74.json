Once the virus infects the nasal mucosa, it is propelled to the nasopharynx through mucociliary action of the respiratory epithelium lining the nasal cavities. The virus then binds to epithelial cell receptors, which allow it to gain entrance into these cells. Within the epithelial cells rapid viral replication occurs.",

In response to viral infection of the nasal epithelial cells, an upregulation of inflammatory mediators occurs, including cytokines such as interleukins 6 and 8, 4,5 which drive the host's inflammatory response. As a result, there is an influx of neutrophils, vasodilation, and an increase in vascular permeability that results in the leakage of plasma proteins into the nasal cavity. Additionally, parasympathetic stimulation occurs, which causes production of excess mucous. 4 This process translates into nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. 4, 5 One reason people are susceptible to recurrent URIs year after year is challenges to immunity. Some virus types, including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, and coronavirus, do not produce lasting immunity. Other viruses, including rhinovirus, adenovirus, and enterovirus, do produce lasting immunity but so many serotypes exist that one is still susceptible to recurrent infection. These challenges are also the reason that no antiviral medications are available that are effective in treating URIs.

            "text": "Nasal congestion is one of the most common and bothersome symptoms of a URI, and therefore many over-the-counter cold remedies are geared toward relieving this symptom. Common oral decongestants include pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine. Phenylpropanolamine was previously used in over-the-counter preparations but has been removed from the market because of an associated risk of intracranial hemorrhage. 5 Pseudoephedrine, a popular over-the-counter remedy for nasal congestion, has come under scrutiny recently because of its use in the illicit manufacturing of methamphetamines. Although still available over-thecounter, it is now only accessible behind pharmacy counters and its purchase is monitored. 5 A review of the current literature was completed in 2009 by Taverner and Latte 7 to assess the efficacy of topical and oral decongestants in relieving nasal congestion. Only randomized, placebo-controlled trials were included in their review. Their analysis indicated that nasal decongestants offer modest but significant relief of nasal congestion with a low incidence of adverse effects. Symptomatic relief was supported by a physiologic response of a significant reduction in nasal airway resistance. The evidence supports recommending a single dose trial of decongestants for patients with a URI. Those who experience improvement in symptoms of nasal congestion should be encouraged to continue treatment for 3 to 5 days. It is important to inform patients to discontinue use of topical decongestants after this period because of the risk of a rebound increase in congestion, as is seen with rhinitis medicamentosa. Patients with hypertension and/or benign prostatic hypertrophy should be closely monitored if using oral decongestants because the a-adrenergic properties may exacerbate these conditions.",

Their research concluded that when taken prophylactically, it was not effective in reducing the incidence of common cold in the general population. It did, however, have a beneficial effect on the severity and duration of symptoms. In a population consisting of people who performed strenuous physical activity and/or were subjected to significant cold stress, it can reduce the incidence of URIs when taken prophylactically. 19 When vitamin C was taken after the onset of cold symptoms, it did not exhibit a benefit on the severity or duration of symptoms, but this is an area that requires further study. 19 Vitamin D Vitamin D is known to play a role in immune system regulation. Studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency may result in more missed work days because of URIs. 20 Therefore, questions regarding its potential role in preventing or treating infection have been raised. A randomized controlled trial comparing vitamin D 3 supplementation versus placebo completed over 12 weeks during winter revealed no benefit in reducing the incidence of URIs or the severity of symptoms with vitamin Complementary and Integrative Treatments supplementation. 21 However, the authors postulated that they could have failed to detect a benefit because of small sample size and late initiation of vitamin D supplementation during winter. They suggest that initiating supplementation during the fall could be more effective because it coincides with the time year when sunlight exposure deceases and would allow more time for vitamin D levels to stabilize. 21 Therefore, further study seems warranted.",

Additionally, when considering all subjects, an affect on URI rates, symptom severity, or symptom duration was not appreciated. 30 Multimodal Approaches Acupuncture Sinus and nasal symptoms are ailments frequently treated by licensed acupuncturists who report good efficacy. 33 However, evidence supporting the use of acupuncture for URIs is limited, and therefore, a well-designed randomized control trial is needed.",
