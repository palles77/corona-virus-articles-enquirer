If an influenza pandemic occurs, it is expected to have dire consequences, including millions of deaths, social disruption, and enormous economic consequences. The Department of Health and Human Resources plan, released in November 2005, clearly affirms the threat of a pandemic. Anticipating a disruption in many factions of society, every segment of the healthcare industry, including nursing homes, will be affected and will need to be self-sufficient. Disruption of vaccine distribution during the seasonal influenza vaccine shortage during the 2004/05 influenza season is but one example of erratic emergency planning. Nursing homes will have to make vital decisions and provide care to older adults who will not be on the initial priority list for vaccine. At the same time, nursing homes will face an anticipated shortage of antiviral medications and be expected to provide surge capacity for overwhelmed hospitals. This article provides an overview of current recommendations for pandemic preparedness and the potential effect of a pandemic on the nursing home industry. It highlights the need for collaborative planning and dialogue between nursing homes and various stakeholders already heavily invested in pandemic preparedness.",

The only missing characteristic is the lack of a sustained human-to-human transmission, although transient human-to-human transmission has been reported. 3 Direct sustained contact with infected birds is a requisite for avian influenza infection, although for efficient human-to-human transmission to occur, only a single genetic mutation is required. 2 Wild birds, which carry the virus asymptomatically, have been spreading H5N1 to domestic birds (ducks and chickens) throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. Domestic birds are highly susceptible to this virus, and mortality rates in these flocks can reach 100% [3] [4] [5] .",

They have a duty to provide care to their patients; at the same time, society has an obligation to support HCWs, who will bear the greatest risk in fulfilling their care responsibilities. One of several ethical dilemmas that nursing homes face is determining whether vaccine should be distributed to save the \"most number of lives\" or the \"most years of life.\" 20 Should policy makers give priority to individuals who are more likely to die if infected (e.g., an 89-year-old nursing home resident) or to individuals who are less likely to die if infected but stand to lose more if they did (e.g., a 41-year-old HCW with two children)? The HHS pandemic preparedness plan currently advocates saving \"most years of life\" by prioritizing immunization to HCWs. 6 Nursing homes, like other healthcare employers, are expected to maintain healthy work environments. Whether they have appropriate guidance to streamline their immunization programs during healthcare emergencies, be it seasonal influenza vaccine shortage or pandemic influenza response planning, needs to be examined further.",

Current regional-level planning does not bring nursing homes to the table. In a severe pandemic, traditional hospital care (as well as care provided in the community and nursing homes) will need to be altered significantly, and elective services would have to deferred and acute services rationed.
