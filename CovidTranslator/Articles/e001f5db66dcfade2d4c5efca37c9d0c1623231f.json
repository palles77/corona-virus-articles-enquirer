The largest report of COVID-19 from the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention summarized findings from 72, 314 cases and noted that while 81% were of a mild nature with an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%, a small subgroup of 5% presented with respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction resulting in fatality in half of such cases, a finding that suggests that it is within this group that the opportunity for life saving measures may be most pertinent. 1 Once the disease is manifest, supportive measures are initiated with quarantines; however a systematic disease modifying therapeutic approach remains empirical.",

Whether in native state, immunoquiescent state as in the elderly, or immunosuppressed state as in heart transplantation, the disease tends to present and follow these two phases, albeit in different levels of severity. The early reports in heart transplantation suggest that symptom expression during the phase of establishment of infection are similar to non-immunosuppressed individuals; however, in limited series the second wave determined by the host-inflammatory response appears to be milder, possibly due to the concomitant use of immuno-modulatory drugs. 5, 6 Similarly, an epidemiological study from Wuhan in a cohort of 87 patients suggests that precautionary measures of social distancing, sanitization and general hygiene allow heart transplant recipients to experience a low rate of COVID-19 illness. 7 We do not of course, know if they are asymptomatic carriers, since in this survey-based study universal testing during the early 3 months was not employed. One interesting fact in this study was that many heart transplant recipients have hematological changes of lymphopenia due to the effects of immunosuppressive therapy which may obfuscate the laboratory interpretation of infection in such patients should they get infected.",

It is imperative that a structured approach to clinical phenotyping be undertaken to distinguish the phase where the viral pathogenicity is dominant versus when the host inflammatory response overtakes the pathology. In this editorial we propose a clinical staging system to establish a standardized nomenclature for uniform evaluation and reporting of this disease, to facilitate therapeutic application and evaluate response. We propose the use of a 3-stage classification system, recognizing that COVID-19 illness exhibits three grades of increasing severity which correspond with distinct clinical findings, response to therapy and clinical outcome (Figure) .",

For most people, this involves an incubation period associated with mild and often non-specific symptoms such as malaise, fever and a dry cough. During this period, SARS-CoV-2 multiplies and establishes residence in the host, primarily focusing on the respiratory system. Similar to its older relative, SARS-CoV (responsible for the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak), SARS-CoV-2 binds to its target using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cells. 8 These receptors are abundantly present on human lung and small intestine epithelium, as well as the vascular endothelium. As a result of the airborne method of transmission as well as affinity for pulmonary ACE2 receptors, the infection usually presents with mild respiratory and systemic symptoms. Diagnosis at this stage includes respiratory sample PCR, serum testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, along with chest imaging, complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests. CBC may reveal a lymphopenia and neutrophilia without other significant abnormalities. Treatment at this stage is primarily targeted towards symptomatic relief.",

It should be noted that serum procalcitonin is low to normal in most cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. In early stage II (without significant hypoxia), the use of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 may be avoided. 4 However, if hypoxia ensues, it is likely that patients will progress to requiring mechanical ventilation and in that situation, we believe that use of anti-inflammatory therapy such as with corticosteroids may be useful and can be judiciously employed. Thus, Stage II disease should be subdivided into Stage IIa (without hypoxia) and Stage IIb (with hypoxia).",

In this stage, markers of systemic inflammation appear to be elevated. COVID-19 infection results in a decrease in helper, suppressor and regulatory T cell counts. 9 Studies have shown that inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, Creactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer are significantly elevated in those patients with more severe disease. 10 Troponin and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can also be elevated. A form akin to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) may occur in patients in this advanced stage of disease. 11 In this stage, shock, vasoplegia, respiratory failure and even cardiopulmonary collapse are discernable. Systemic organ involvement, even myocarditis, would manifest during this stage. Tailored therapy in stage III hinges on the use of immunomodulatory agents to reduce systemic inflammation before it overwhelmingly results in multi-organ dysfunction. In this phase, use of corticosteroids may be justified in concert with the use of cytokine inhibitors such as tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) or anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist). 11 Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may also play a role in modulating an immune system that is in a hyperinflammatory state. Overall, the prognosis and recovery from this critical stage of illness is poor, and rapid recognition and deployment of such therapy may have the greatest yield.",
