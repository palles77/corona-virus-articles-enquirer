In poor countries, not only are children more vulnerable to disease and death than adults, compared with industrialized nations, they constitute a much larger proportion of the population. Most developing countries have pyramidal populations reflecting high birth rates and short-life spans. By contrast, the age structure of industrialized countries tends to be onion shaped due to decreasing birth rates and longer life expectancy. Recent socioeconomic changes in many poor countries have resulted in a shift in the patterns of disease. As a consequence of lifestyle and behaviour changes, as well as a shift from rural to urban living, developing countries have to cope with chronic noncommunicable illnesses such as adult cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression, while continuing to struggle with childhood infectious, perinatal and nutritional disorders. 2 Despite these recent developments, the public health sector still tends to focus on children. This is not only because the greatest disease burden still occurs in the youngest age groups, but also because childhood interventions tend to be the most costeffective and sustainable, and the development of children determines the quality of future populations.",

Two further adjustments are made: discounting and age-weighing. Future years of healthy life lost are often discounted by 3% per year, i.e. years in the future count for less compared to those in the present. Discounting future health reduces the relative impact of a child death compared with an adult death. The value that is accorded for a year of life lost is also age-weighed, based on the assumption that the relative value of a year of life rises rapidly from zero at birth to a peak in the early 20s, after which it steadily declines. The strengths of this approach are that it incorporates disability and it allows comparison between diseases, populations and time periods.",

Frequently, it is necessary to conduct a census to have an accurate and up-to-date denominator. The conduct of RETROSPECTIVE REVIEWS OF EXISTING DATA An assessment of available data provides a general idea about health and disease statistics in a country or region. Collating and analysing existing information is relatively cheap and quick, may be useful to assess trends and may provide a nation-or region-wide picture but its limitations need to be kept in mind. The quality of the assessment depends on the data used to reach it. For example, reliance on public agencies' estimates of a disease, which may be inflated to increase public attention and consequently increase funding, will distort global calculations. The World Health Organization (WHO) compiles more comprehensive health data annually but the accuracy of reporting varies between diseases and across countries. 3 These estimates rely on routine notification, which may be weakened by over-and under-diagnosis, incomplete reporting and delays. Reporting of some diseases may be suppressed due to social taboos (e.g. HIV/AIDS) or the fear of trade sanctions (e.g. cholera).",

An illness may be uncommon or have low death rates but can still cause considerable burden through chronic disability. In the 1990s, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, together with the WHO and the World Bank, estimated the global burden of disease by region and age group, in terms of disability-adjusted life years lost (DALYs). DALYs are the sum of years of life lost due to premature death and years living with disability of specified severity and duration.

For example, dengue, a vector-borne viral illness, has a broad range of presentations. The majority of patients recover following a self-limiting febrile illness but a small proportion progress to severe disease, mostly characterized by plasma leakage leading to circulatory failure. 10 Home visits and clinic-based studies are likely to detect dengue fever, whereas hospital-based studies mainly capture the severe forms of the disease ( Figure 6 .1).

Active surveillance detects the disease of interest by regularly visiting or contacting residents of a community. Active surveillance is especially appropriate when the disease of interest is characterized by mild symptoms not likely to cause the patient to present for treatment. Active surveillance, particularly if diagnosis requires laboratory testing and confirmation, is labour-intensive and expensive. In addition, field workers require rigorous training and close supervision to ensure adherence to standardized methods. These logistic complexities limit the population size that can be included in such studies. There is also the danger of fatigue or refusal by the community if the purpose of the study is incompletely understood or if the visits are not conducted in a culturally acceptable fashion.",

Passive surveillance may be done through treatment facilities established by the researchers or through existing primary healthcare units. When the burden of disease in a very large population is to be measured, then sentinel surveillance in several selected secondary or tertiary hospitals dispersed over a large geographic area may be conducted. This method is much more cost-efficient but unlike active surveillance, is subject to potential bias, since case detection is influenced by the study population's utilization of treatment. Although passive surveillance may be enhanced by regular community dialogue and household visits to encourage consultation for the disease of interest, it may still underestimate the burden of a disease for which the population usually selfmedicates or seeks care with alternative or traditional healers who do not participate in the study. To avoid this bias, the incomplete or the reported cause of death may be unreliable. Many deaths in developing countries do not occur in hospitals, and officials who had neither treated nor seen the deceased person, may be requested to sign death certificates. Verbal autopsy or verbal postmortem is an alternative method to collect mortality data. It enables investigators to ascribe a probable cause of death, retrospectively. Verbal autopsy consists of a detailed interview of the deceased's next of kin or caregiver and a review of relevant records (e.g. clinic visit records) to determine symptoms and signs of illness before death, so as to establish the most likely cause of death.",

The interviewers should be specially trained. The interval between death and interview should be culturally appropriate but not overly long as to affect recall. Algorithms for decoding the completed interviews into causes of death must be clearly pre-defined. For example, two medically trained individuals may independently assess the completed verbal autopsy forms to identify the likely cause of each death. If there is disagreement between the two diagnoses, a third physician may adjudicate the decision. If the physicians cannot determine the cause of death, the death may be recorded as unspecified. Computer-automated methods for assigning cause of death have also been proposed and used. In most studies, the cause of death is assigned according to the International Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death codes as recommended by the WHO. 12 Metrics for assessing the performance of different verbal autopsy cause assignment methods have been developed. 13 Verbal autopsy studies are becoming increasingly common, with the largest to date conducted in India. 14 In this 'One million deaths study' , all deaths occurring in 2001-2003 in 1.1 million nationally representative Indian households, were surveyed. fraction of presenting or admitted patients who die (case fatality rate) or who develop complications and disability is reported. In prospective surveillance studies, cases have to be immediately and appropriately treated, thus the rates of complications, disability and death are often lower than would be noted outside a research setting. This inherent bias has to be kept in mind when drawing conclusions about sequelae and deaths from prospective research studies.",

Unlike prospective surveillance studies, cross-sectional surveys do not provide information on incidence, i.e. the number of new cases per population during a specific time period. However, they may provide other important public health information. For example, for diseases that induce life-long antibodies (e.g. HIV, hepatitis A and B), sero-epidemiological studies may show the age groups most affected and when done at different time periods and geographic locations, may indicate the effectiveness of prevention and control strategies.

For example, the public, provider and patient costs of culture-confirmed cholera were measured in four choleraendemic study sites using a combination of hospital-and community-based studies. 20 Families with culture-proven cases were surveyed at home, 7 and 14 days after confirmation of illness. Hospital-based studies found that the costs of severe cholera were US$32 and US$47 in Matlab (Bangladesh) and Beira (Mozambique), respectively. Community-based studies in North Jakarta (Indonesia) and Kolkata (India) found that cholera cases cost between US$28 and US$206, depending on hospitalization. Patients' cost of illness, as a percentage of average monthly income, was 21% and 65% for hospitalized cases in Kolkata and North Jakarta, respectively. This analysis highlighted the financial burden of an acute diarrhoeal disease on households, often contributing to further poverty. The impact of chronic conditions such as HIV/AIDS on individuals, households and countries is more difficult to quantify. Presumably, HIV/AIDS is an important cause of poverty in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. And yet, the impoverishing effects of AIDS have been inadequately assessed by existing studies, likely because of methodological challenges. 21 Policy-maker surveys may be conducted to elicit government opinions about diseases. For example, DeRoeck and co-workers interviewed policy-makers and other influential professionals in four South-east Asian countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam) to determine their views on the public health importance of dengue, the need for a vaccine and the determinants influencing its potential introduction. 22 ",

The method involves randomly allocating participants into study and control groups, to receive or not receive the intervention being evaluated. 1 The results are assessed by a comparison of rates of disease or other appropriate outcome in the study and control group. There are practical challenges to doing RCTs in less developed countries, where infrastructure and expertise may not be available. But many infections are geographically limited to developing countries and data on protection against naturally occurring disease can only be obtained in these sites. Even for diseases occurring in both industrialized and developing countries, study results may not necessarily be generalizable because of differences in population characteristics. For example, it has been shown that the immunogenicity of vaccines can be much lower in populations in developing compared with industrialized countries. Poorer performance has been especially problematic for orally administered live vaccines. The efficacy of the Rotarix\u2122 and RotaTeq\u2122 vaccines against severe rotavirus related disease in developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Central America does not appear to be as high as that seen in developed countries. [25] [26] [27] Another frequently cited example is the finding that three doses of oral polio vaccine, as formerly used in the USA, resulted in sustained, probably lifelong immunity, whereas many children in developing countries may require >3 doses for adequate seroconversion. 28 The poor performance of these vaccines in developing country populations is not well understood, but could be due to several factors, including high levels of pre-existing natural immunity (either maternal or infection-derived), poor nutritional status, tropical enteropathy and co-existing infections. 29 Even within the developing world, findings from a randomized, controlled trial done in one region may not be generalizable to another region because of differences in the epidemiology of disease. For example, to seek new and improved treatments for severe falciparum malaria, a large multinational randomized comparison of parenteral artesunate versus the standard therapy of parenteral quinine was conducted in South-east Asia. 30 The trial proved that severe falciparum malaria mortality could be reduced by 30% in Asian adults when artesunate is used, but key decision-makers in Africa felt the results of this study were not generalizable to their populations where severe falciparum malaria tends to occur in children, rather than in adults. Over a 5 year period 5000 children with severe malaria in nine African countries participated in a large, multicentre, open-label randomized trial that established the superior efficacy of parenteral artesunate over quinine and led to a change in treatment guidelines. 31, 32 ",

The GCP guidelines aim to ensure not only ethical conduct of studies, but generation of credible data. The guidelines' objectives of documenting informed consent, participant safety and data integrity are worthy. However, it has been argued that these GCP guidelines are based on consensus of expert opinions and not on evidence. 43 Not surprisingly, the individual standards as well as the concept of standardization of clinical trials of pharmacological interventions are not free of controversy. There have been increasing calls for the guidelines to be made more scientific, up-to-date, flexible and simple through collaborative and evidence-based efforts. 43, 44 For trials in developing countries, rigid adherence to GCP standards as they are now formulated, have both positive and unfavorable consequences. 45 The complexity and expense of clinical trials has risen rapidly in recent years. A portion of this increased expense arises from the extensive documentation and auditing requirements demanded by GCP guidelines. This constitutes a disincentive to the clinical testing of drugs and vaccines for diseases mainly affecting developing countries and for which profitable markets are not foreseen. Furthermore, compliance with the stringent GCP requirements often requires the engagement of expensive policy. This may require development of both detailed 'investment cases' , as well as much shorter policy briefs. Presentation of the information in scientific journals is important, but it is also important to arrange presentations of study findings in both small and large meetings attended by policy-makers. The onus of assuring the attendance of policy-makers at such meetings is on the investigators. Finally, because the WHO has the ear of policy-makers, presentation of the findings at relevant WHO meetings, at both the regional and global levels is critical. An illustration of this approach was provided by efforts to synthesize and communicate the evidence on cholera and oral cholera vaccines. Synthesis of these findings into a white paper, and subsequently an investment case, for WHO's Scientific Advisory Group of Experts led to a greatly strengthened recommendation on oral cholera vaccines by WHO, 48 and provided the background for a recent World Health Assembly resolution, recommending the use of vaccines in the public health armamentarium against cholera. 49",

For example, the DOMI Program was based on an initial systematic survey of policymakers about evidence needs in targeted countries, and the DOMI field research programme was formulated on the basis of these findings. 47 Also, DOMI's multifaceted research programme to generate evidence was implemented in partnership with Ministries of Health in order to ensure that the decisionmakers would have a sense of ownership of the findings.
