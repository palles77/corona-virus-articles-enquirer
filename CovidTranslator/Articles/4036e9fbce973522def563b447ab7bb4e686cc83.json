            "text": "A novel polyomavirus (WU virus) has been identified in pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI), but its role as a respiratory pathogen has not yet been demonstrated. To investigate if WU virus is related to acute respiratory infections in infants and children in Beijing, specimens collected from 674 pediatric patients with ARI from April 2007 to May 2008 and from 202 children without ARI were used for this investigation. Common respiratory viruses were tested by virus isolation and/or antigen detection by indirect immunofluorescent assay followed by RT-PCR or PCR for other viruses associated with respiratory infections in specimens collected from patients with ARI before WU virus DNA was detected. WU virus DNA was detected by initial screening and secondary confirmation PCR for all specimens. The region encoding the VP2 gene of the virus was amplified from 17 WU-virus-positive clinical specimens, and sequence analysis was performed. Thirty-eight of 674 (5.6%) specimens from patients with ARI and 3 of 202 (1.5%) specimens from children without ARI yielded PCR products with the predicted molecular weight, using either screening or confirmation primer sets, indicating that these specimens were WU virus positive. However, more than 60% of the 38 WU-virus-positive specimens from patients with ARI were also positive for one or more respiratory viruses. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the region encoding the VP2 gene from 17 Beijing WU viruses shared high homology ([98.5%) with sequences from GenBank and among themselves. The data indicated that WU virus in Beijing occurred 3.7 times more frequently in pediatric patients with ARI than in those without ARI (p \\ 0.05).",

The virus was initially detected in a nasopharyngeal aspirate collected from a 3-year-old Australian child diagnosed with pneumonia. Although its multiple DNA fragments shared limited homology with known polyomavirus, the genomic characteristics of these fragments were similar to those of members of the family Polyomaviridae, and the virus was therefore referred to as WU polyomavirus (WU virus) [1] . Since then, the detection and molecular characterization of WU virus in clinical respiratory specimens from patients with ARI have been reported in several articles [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , but the role that the virus plays as a respiratory pathogen remains to be determined [7] .",

Among the 14 different polyomaviruses that have been described, BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV) are the only two known to productively infect and cause disease in humans [8, 9] . BKV has been reported to cause nephropathy, hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic cystitis in immunosuppressed patients, and JCV has been linked to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in immunocompromised patients [10] . The mode of transmission for BKV and JCV has not yet been well defined. However, some of the evidence has suggested that respiratory transmission occurs. Sero-antibodies for both viruses are prevalent, and seroconversion occurs in childhood, as indicated by seropositive rates for BKV reaching 90% in children aged 5-9 years and for JCV, reaching 50-60% after the age of 10 years. Potential alternative modes of transmission for these viruses include urino-oral, transplacental transmission, and transmission by blood transfusion, semen and organ transplantation. Primary infections with BKV and JCV are typically subclinical or linked to mild respiratory illness and are followed by viral dissemination to the sites of lifelong persistent infection [11] .",
