            "text": "Neonates represent a unique and highly vulnerable patient population. Advances in medical technology that have occurred over the last few decades have improved the survival and quality of life for neonates, particularly those infants born with extreme prematurity or with congenital defects. Although immunologic immaturity and altered cutaneous barriers play some role in the vulnerability of neonates to nosocomial infections, clearly, therapeutic interventions that have proven to be lifesaving for these fragile infants also appear to be associated with the majority of infectious complications resulting in neonatal morbidity and mortality. Rates of infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have varied from 6% to 40% of neonatal patients, with the highest rates in those facilities having larger proportions of very low-birth-weight infants (birthweight #1000 grams) or neonates requiring surgery. Efforts to protect the vulnerable NICU infants include the following: (1) optimal infection control practices, especially good hand hygiene and good nursery design; (2) prudent use of invasive interventions with particular attention to early removal of invasive devices after they are no longer essential; and (3) As with other settings in which critically ill patients receive care, infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) are at risk for health care-associated infections because of their profound physiologic instability and exposure to invasive devices and broadspectrum antibiotics. [1] [2] [3] However, this group of infants has some unique host risk factors that make them particularly vulnerable for acquiring health careassociated infections, as well as experiencing more severe illness as a result of these infections. Whether the infant is born prematurely or at full term, many components of the immune system exhibit diminished functional capacity (quantitative and qualitative) when compared with older children and adults 4 ( Table 1) . Most of the differences are based merely on an agerelated intrinsic immaturity, which is more profound the earlier during gestation that the infant is born. In addition, the protected environment of intrauterine life prevents any significant immunologic exposure that would be necessary to prime many valuable protective immune responses. For these reasons, the newborn infant depends heavily on passively acquired maternal antibodies received from their mother by transplacental passage. 5 These passively acquired antibodies are primarily immunoglobulin G (IgG). Transmission of the antibodies to the fetus begins approximately midgestation (24-26 weeks gestation), with levels of IgG antibodies in the fetus not reaching adult levels until near full term. Infants born prematurely will have IgG antibody levels that are significantly lower than older children and adults. 5 These passively acquired antibodies represent the mother's prior experience and therefore may not always provide adequate protection against microorganisms to which the infant will be exposed in the NICU. The sick premature infant as well as full-term neonate may exhibit an iatrogenic hypogammaglobulinemia as a result of frequent blood drawing, which removes available maternally derived antibodies before the infant is capable of producing adequate antibodies for immunologic protection.",

A mode of nosocomial transmission that is unique to neonates is natal or intrapartum transmission of microorganisms from mother to infant derived from the maternal birth canal. Any microorganism found in the maternal birth canal can result in infection of the newborn based on the pathogenicity of the microorganism and the susceptibility of the infant ( Table 2) . NICU residents can also become infected with health care-associated infections through horizontal transmission of microorganisms spread by aerosol or contact (direct or indirect) transmission. Despite the enhanced safety of blood products administered in hospitals at the present time, the frequent utilization of blood products in the stabilization of critically ill newborns allows for the potential transmission of bloodborne pathogens, currently identified and those yet to be identified. [12] [13] [14] [15] Administration of breast milk from either the infant's mother or donor-bank breast milk provides an opportunity for the transmission of agents found in breast milk and skin of the breast milk donor [15] [16] [17] (Table 3) . However, donor screening and pasteurization of donor breast milk has made this product very safe for use in even the most critically ill neonate.",

            "text": "Bacteremias or bloodstream infections (BSI) are the single most important infections within the NICU because of their frequency and their potential for lifethreatening consequences. Infants who develop bacteremia in the first few days of life (early onset sepsis) typically acquire their organism from their mother during the intrapartum period. The microorganisms responsible are found in the maternal birth canal and are transmitted to the infant either through an ascending route immediately prior to labor and delivery (especially in the presence of ruptured amniotic membranes) or through exposure as the infant is delivered. The illness is characterized by a fulminant multisystem disease, with a high mortality rate. Premature birth, low birth weight, maternal fever, premature rupture of membranes, maternal chorioamnionitis, and maternal colonization with group B Streptococcus are specific risk factors for early onset bacteremia and sepsis. Utilization of antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis to prevent early onset group B Streptococcus sepsis has successfully reduced the incidence of early onset group B Streptococcus infections 26 but has been associated with an increase in early onset Escherichia coli infections in very low-birth-weight infants. 27 Late onset bacteremia occurs after 5 to 7 days of age. This may be due to maternally derived microorganisms that colonize the infant in the intrapartum period or can represent infection acquired nosocomially (horizontal transmission). Most episodes of nosocomial bacteremia in the NICU are associated with indwelling vascular catheters. 27, 28 Administration of lipids, low birth weight, respiratory tract disease on admission, catheter hub colonization, blood sampling through the central catheter, and treatment with H2 blockers also are independently associated with bloodstream infections. 29, 30 If the infection occurs in the first 30 days of life, microorganisms most commonly identified are coagulasenegative Staphylococcus (CONS), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, and gram-negative enteric rods. After 30 days of age, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus is still the most common organism causing nosocomial bacteremia. However, fungi, particularly Candida 31 species, and Malassezia furfur become more prominent. Infants whose birth weights are ,1000 gram are at greatest risks for nosocomial bacteremia. Despite the recognition of the importance of nosocomial bacteremia in the NICU, the rate of bacteremia in NICU patients identified by the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System has not changed considerably over the last decade 3, 32 (Table 4) .",

            "text": "Critically ill neonates frequently have underlying respiratory tract conditions (hyaline membrane disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and others). The respiratory status of the neonate may be further compromised by the development of pneumonia or tracheitis (Table 4 ). Similar to bacteremia, respiratory tract infections can be divided into groups by time of onset: early onset pneumonia versus late onset pneumonia/tracheitis. In the first few days of life, neonates who develop pneumonia usually have infections with microorganisms acquired natally. Group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, and gram-negative enteric rods may result in an overwhelming respiratory tract infection that may be present very shortly after birth. 33 Late onset pneumonia and tracheitis are more commonly because of infection with gram-negative enteric bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus. Endotracheal intubation is the major risk factor. 33, 34 As with other invasive device-related infections, health care-associated pneumonia and tracheitis can be reduced by minimizing intubation days and proper care and maintenance of the ventilator-endotracheal tube circuit. Colonization of the endotracheal tube is virtually inevitable. Lower respiratory tract disease is not established by the mere presence of bacteria isolated from samples of the respiratory tract. Rather, lower respiratory tract disease is diagnosed by changes in respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, changes in oxygen requirements, new or changing infiltrates on the chest x-ray, increased volume or change in consistency of secretions suctioned from the endotracheal tube) combined with evidence of an acute inflammatory response, such as fever or polymorphonuclear leukocytes and a predominant bacteria on gram stain of tracheal secretions. Infants in the NICU are particularly vulnerable to community-acquired viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza can be devastating to the critically ill neonate and may be responsible for nursery-wide outbreaks. [35] [36] [37] Immature gastrointestinal immunity, diminished interfering normal microbial flora, higher gastric pH, shorter gastric emptying time, increased permeability of gastrointestinal mucosa, and use of nasogastric tubes place the critically ill neonates at particular risk for acquiring gastrointestinal infections while in the NICU. Specific agents responsible for gastrointestinal disease may vary, based on the geographic location of the nursery, but viruses such as rotavirus, 38 and enteric adenovirus and coronavirus, as well as Escherichia coli species and other gram-negative enteric rods are most commonly implicated. 39, 40 Clostridium difficile presents a unique problem. Asymptomatic colonization of the neonate has been identified. 41, 42 Neonates have reduced receptors for the Clostridium difficile toxin and therefore are less susceptible to development of disease following colonization with C difficile. 43 However, although asymptomatic colonization may occur, neonates can develop disease because of Clostridium difficile. Identification of C difficile toxin in a symptomatic newborn without evidence of another pathogen, and particularly in the presence of colitis (stools with leukocytes and/or red blood cells), warrants therapy and isolation for C difficile. Necrotizing enterocolitis is a unique medical condition seen primarily in critically ill newborns. This condition is multifactorial in origin (immature gastrointestinal tract, ischemia; overgrowth of bacteria). Outbreaks of necrotizing enterocolitis have been temporally associated with nursery outbreaks with Klebsiella, E coli, Entrobacter cloacae, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, rotavirus, enteric Coronavirus, and Clostridium difficile. [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Superficial and deep skin and subcutaneous infections are common in newborns in the NICU. Neonates have extremely fragile skin, which is frequently traumatized. Cellulitis, abscesses, and dermatitis are common and are frequently noted at sites of percutaneous puncture (lancets, scalp electrodes, and others) and surgical procedures or the sites of diapers or electrodes. Omphalitis is relatively uncommon but occurs more frequently in the preterm infant than in the term infant. Staphylococcus aureus is by far the most common microorganism responsible for all skin and subcutaneous infections in NICU patients. Recent increases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), both endemic health care associated and community acquired, have made management of these infections more complicated. Vancomycin utilization has increased because many of the alternate antibiotics for MRSA have little experience or are not appropriate in neonates (eg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, linezolid, daptomycin). Gram-negative enteric rods and yeasts are less commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections than Staphylococcus aureus. However, these microorganisms are becoming more prevalent and are particularly associated with surgical procedures affecting the gastrointestinal tract.",

In addition, CDC Category Specific Isolation Precautions or some similar isolation precautions may be necessary to restrict spread of contagious diseases within the NICU.

However, nurseries are frequently set up in a ward setting and have fewer private or isolation rooms in other areas of the hospital. If and when isolation rooms are not available, cohorting of patients with similar contagious diseases may be necessary. The routine use of gowns is not indicated for staff and visitors. 51 The routine use (not for isolation purposes) of gowns has not been shown to reduce health care-associated infections, increase handwashing, or decrease nursery traffic. [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] However, gowns should be used if required for isolation, and soiling is possible. Also, long-armed gowns should be used for handling infants outside of the incubator or bassinet. Caps, masks, and hair nets are not indicated for routine use but may be required for isolation or surgical procedures. The wearing of employee scrubs is of no proven infection control benefit. 51 However, this traditional practice may have some additional benefits for the staff morale.",

The NICU should have policies that will identify visitors with contagious diseases. A trained health care professional should interview parents at a site outside of the nursery to assess the health of parents and each sibling visitor. No child with symptoms consistent with an acute contagious illness should be allowed to visit. Fever, rhinorrhea, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, and dermatitis should exclude visitors from entering the NICU. Visitors should perform appropriate hand hygiene on entering the NICU.

If resources are limited, it may not be possible to monitor rates of all infections. Efforts should concentrate on those infections that have higher morbidity or those that are more common within the nursery. Surveillance needs to be done in real time so that the information obtained can have an impact in a timely manner. Routine surveillance cultures are generally not recommended.

However, judicious use of antibiotics may represent one of the more important measures for reducing the impact of infections within the NICU. Whenever possible, the narrowest spectrum antibiotics should be used to treat an identified infection or condition. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, particularly those that can impact the endogenous microbial flora of the gastrointestinal tract or skin, have the potential to eradicate many of the helpful bacteria and replace them with more virulent and antibioticresistant bacteria. Use of third-generation cephalosporins and vancomycin should be minimized, and possibly restricted, so that they only are prescribed for serious or life-threatening infections for which alternate narrower spectrum antibiotics are not adequate or appropriate. Antibiotics should only be used to treat proven or suspected bacterial infections. The entire antibiotic treatment course should be completed. However, antibiotics should be discontinued when the infection is cured or when it is likely that the condition is not due to a bacterial infection. H2 blockers should be avoided when possible. H2 blockers raise the gastric pH, which might play a role in promoting overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria or fungi. This increase in bacterial and fungal colonization might play a role in increasing respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract infections in the ill neonate.",
