A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent and was subsequently termed SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Epidemic disease quickly spread across 31 provinces and regions. As of 23:00 CET on March 5, a total of 98,067 new confirmed cases have been reported globally, with deaths of 3,281. A total of 17,637 cases have been confirmed in 78 countries outside China. [1] The new coronavirus outbreak has surpassed the severity of SARS in 2003. [2, 3] The outbreak of virus coincided with China's Spring Festival travel peak, and to curb the spread of the disease, the Chinese government launched unprecedented public health intervention measures, such as shutting down Wuhan transportation, extending the legal holiday, mass isolation, strict enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, and canceling all public gatherings and health public to abide by hygienic practices. To reduce the flow of people, the health monitoring of returning residents has been conducted at the nationwide level. As of 16:00 clock on February 28, Dr. Wan'nian Liang, chief of the National Health Commission's institutional reform department and head of the Chinese expert panel, said: The virus outbreak in Wuhan is curbed basic. The number of new confirmed cases per day declined from a high peak of 3,900 cases on 13 February to 323 cases on 27 February. The number of newly cured cases has exceeded the number of newly confirmed cases for eight consecutive days since February 20. The proportion of severe cases declined from 31.6% to 22.4% from February 11 to February 27. The death rate has fallen from a peak of 9.0% on January 16th to 4.4% now. [4] As the WHO leader Bruce Aylward said at a COVID-19 news conference on February 24, \"China's made comprehensive non-pharmaceutical interventions, which have effectively prevented the transmission of the virus, providing important lessons for the global response to new virus\" [5] . This is an unprecedented effort, and it surpasses previous efforts to combat SARS.\" However, there is no doubt that no other countries can follow China's current example. [6] In the global spread background, from the perspective of social epidemiology, this paper aims to summarize these detailed intervention measures taken by the Chinese government and explain how the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province was effectively controlled by these public health interventions measures. We also improve the public health system in the future by summarizing these lessons from this outbreak.",

The response mechanism was initiated with multisectoral involvement in joint prevention and control measures. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the municipality of Wuhan was closed, and efforts were made to identify the zoonotic source. Information on the epidemic was sent to WHO on 3 January, and the whole genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was shared with WHO on 10 January. Protocols for COVID-19 diagnosis and diagnosis and treatment were formulated. Mechanism of the State Council were established. President Xi Jinping personally directed and deployed the prevention and work control and requested that the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak be the top priority of government at national levels. [7] Prevention and control measures have been implemented rapidly, from the early stages in Wuhan and other key areas of Hubei province to the current overall national epidemic. It has been undertaken in three main phases, with important events defining those phases. COVID-19 outbreak was included in the statutory report On January 29, all provinces across China had launched the highest level of response for major public health emergencies.",

In Wuhan city and other priority areas of Hubei Province, the focus was on actively treating patients, reducing deaths, and preventing exports. In other provinces, the focus was on preventing importations, curbing the spread of the disease and implementing joint prevention and control measures. In this fight, medical resources from all over China have been mobilized to support the medical treatment of patients in Wuhan. A total of 343 medical teams were organized, and 42,200 medical staff members from 29 provinces and Xinjiang production and construction corps were used to assist Wuhan and Hubei Province.

The data and information system for epidemic prevention and control based on the people's public security big data system is an important \"weapon\" for Wuhan to win the battle of epidemic prevention and control. Additionally, the Wuhan government proposed a large step to ensure that 100% of confirmed patients should be received to the hospital, that 100% of suspected cases were undergoing nucleic acid-based testing, 100% of fever patients were detected, 100% of close contacts persons were isolation, and community villages implemented 100% 24-hours closed management.

The past month, for example, there were more than 1,800 epidemiological investigation teams in Wuhan, with at least 5 persons in each group, tracking thousands of close contacts every day. It is through painstaking efforts that the vast majority of identified close contacts were tracked down and their health monitored.
