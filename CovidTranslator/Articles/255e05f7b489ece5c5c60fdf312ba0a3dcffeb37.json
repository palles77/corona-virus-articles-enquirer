This study surveyed the prevalence of HCoV-NL63 and influenza viruses in patients with influenza-like illness in Taiwan during 2010 e2011. Methods: Throat samples from 107 hospitalized patients with pneumonia and 175 outpatients with influenza-like illness were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction assays with virus-specific primers, and then virus-positive specimens were confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products. Results: HCoV-NL63 infection was identified in 8.4% (9/107) of hospitalized patients with pneumonia, but not found in outpatients with influenza-like illness. Age distribution of HCoV-NL63 infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia indicated that the group aged 16e25 years (20%) had the highest positive rate compared with the other groups, and exhibited a similar age-specific pattern to influenza A/H1N1 infection, but not influenza A/H3N2 and B infections in hospitalized patients. Seasonal prevalence of HCoV-NL63 infection was late winter, overlapping the highest peak of the influenza A/H1N1 epidemic during",

Two specific embedded proteases, papain-like (PLpro) and 3C-like (3CLpro), mediate processing of 1a and 1ab precursors into 16 nsps (termed nsp1ensp16). Phylogenetic tree analysis of CoV genomes indicates HCoV-NL63 forming a subcluster with HCoV-229E, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and Bat-CoV, assigned to the alphacoronaviruses. 3 Among all genes, HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid (N) shows a low percentage of nucleotide and amino acid identity compared to other CoVs. 2 HCoV-NL63 infection is usually surveyed in children with upper or lower respiratory tract illnesses. HCoV-NL63 infection is found worldwide, but is rarely positive by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. 4e7 The positive rate of HCoV-NL63 infection in children ranges from 1.2% in Japan, 7 1.3% in Taiwan, 8 2.1% in Australia, 4 2.3% in Belgium, 9 2.5% in Canada, 10 to 7% in Switzerland. 11 For adults, HCoV-NL63 infection is identified in 9.3% of respiratory tract illness patients under the age of 20 years in France. 12 HCoV-NL63 infection is predominant in the winter season in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany and Japan, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13 but in spring and summer in Hong Kong, 5 and in autumn and winter in Taiwan. 8 This study analyzed 2010e2011 surveillance data for HCoV-NL63 and influenza virus infection in hospitalized patients with pneumonia and outpatients with influenza-like illness in Taiwan, indicating the prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of HCoV-NL63 infection. Our results demonstrate a comprehensive comparison between HCoV-NL63 and influenza virus infection in hospitalized patients and outpatients.",

A QIAamp Virus RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to extract viral RNA from clinical samples and supernatant of infected cells with HCoV-NL63, with influenza A and B viruses as the positive controls. For detection of HCoV-NL63 infection, a two-step RT-PCR using SYBR Green I was used. The specific primer pair for HCoV-NL63 N gene (nucleotides 26,416e26,666) was forward primer 5 0 -CTGATGGTGTTGTTTGGGTTGC-3 0 and reverse primer 5 0 -AGAATCAGAACGAGTGCGAGAC-3 0 . Real-time RT-PCR mixture contained 2.5 mL cDNA (reverse transcription mixture), 200nM each primer in SYBR Green I master mix (LightCycler TaqMAn Master; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States). PCR was performed with amplification protocol consisting of one cycle at 50 C for 2 minutes, one cycle at 95 C for 10 minutes, 45 cycles at 95 C for 15 seconds, and 60 C for 1 minute. Amplification and detection of specific products were conducted in ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States).

The C t values were 30 for two copies, 27 for 20 copies, and 24 for 200 copies of HCoV-NL63. Melting curve analysis revealed HCoV-NL63 N-specific amplicon melting at 81 C. The PCR products were separated using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, where a 251-bp band was clearly observed in the PCRs with 20 copies and 200 copies of HCoV-NL63 post gels stained with ethidium bromide. The results indicated that the detection limit of the two-step real-time RT-PCR assay was around 20 copies of HCoV-NL63. In addition, cultured supernatants of coxsackie virus 16, enterovirus 71, and influenza viruses were not detectable using two-step real-time RT-PCR assay with HCoV N-specific primers.

Prevalence of HCoV-NL63 was predominant in late winter; co-infection with HCoV-NL63 and influenza A/H1N1 was associated with pneumonia in older adults. Phylogenetic analysis indicated HCoV-NL63 strains in Taiwan were in one of two major clusters based on 1a gene sequences of global strains, showing a low level of heterogeneity between Taiwan and global strains. Transmission of HCoV-NL63 in older adults causes severe low respiratory tract diseases. Our results yield a better understanding of the epidemiology of HCoV-NL63 in Taiwan and contribute information necessary for worldwide surveillance of HCoV-NL63 infection.",
