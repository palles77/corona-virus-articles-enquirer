Taiwan experienced the third-largest outbreak of SARS in the world. This study was conducted in an academic university hospital in Taipei, the city with the largest number of SARS cases in Taiwan during the outbreak. Soon after SARS was reported, the emergency department (ED) of the hospital was inundated by febrile patients returning from affected areas or local people wary of the disease. The situation worsened after consecutive outbreaks within 3 local hospitals and the presence of SARS cases without traceable exposure history, leading to a cessation of emergency service on May 12, 2003.",

Means and SDs were significantly different between SARS and non-SARS groups. The clinical symptoms more commonly found in the SARS group were myalgia (N=52; 65.8%; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.76), loose stool or diarrhea (N=36; 45.6%; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.57), lower respiratory tract symptoms (cough or dyspnea; N=36; 45.6%; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.57), headache (N=18; 22.8%; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.32), and chills (N=16; 20.3%; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.29). Upper respiratory symptoms, including sore throat (N=3; 3.8%; 95% CI 0 to 0.08) and rhinorrhea (N=2; 2.5%; 95% CI 0 to 0.06), were rarely found in the SARS cohort but were common in the non-SARS cohort ( Figure 1 ). Initially, infiltrations on chest radiography were found in 59 SARS (74.7%; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.85) and 22 non-SARS (9.9%; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.14) cases. The final diagnoses of febrile non-SARS cases with infiltration on chest radiography were bronchopneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, and 1 newly diagnosed AIDS patient with pneumocystis carinii infection. Among the SARS patients, infiltration on chest radiography appeared more frequently than the presence of lower respiratory tract symptoms (74.7% versus 45.6%).",

Although cough before or during fever is more likely to be associated with non-SARS cases, lower respiratory tract symptoms developing later (on an average of 3.2 days) in the clinical course would favor the diagnosis of SARS. Furthermore, in 32 (40.5%; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.51) SARS patients, abnormal chest radiographic infiltrate was identified before the onset of lower respiratory tract symptoms. The finding suggests that the absence of lower respiratory tract symptoms is not useful in ruling out SARS and indicates the importance of chest radiographic examination in screening procedures. 9 Although the SARS and the non-SARS groups were significantly different in many laboratory indices, these results should be interpreted carefully. In our study, the SARS patients had longer duration of fever before presenting to the ED than the non-SARS patients.

First, the duration of fever before hospitalization was self-reported and was subject to individual sensitivity to the change of body temperature. However, this limitation should not affect the chronologic sequence of various symptoms. Second, symptoms after hospitalization were not included in our analysis. Although these later symptoms may be helpful in making the diagnosis of SARS, they may not be useful in making early diagnosis. Third, the study was conducted in a single medical center in northern Taiwan, so the findings may not be extrapolated to other patients across the island. However, because the institution was the leading SARS hospital during the outbreak, reporting in total about 24% of the probable SARS cases in Taiwan, the samples should be considered representative. Percentage of initial symptoms and abnormal chest radiograph infiltration. The high seroconversion rates against SARS coronavirus (97.4%) among our SARS cohort suggested that most patients classified as having probable SARS in this study actually had coronavirus infections. Meanwhile, only 40.4% of SARS patients in this study had positive disease course for the 2 groups, with regard to the onset of fever. These laboratory indices may be useful in diagnosis of SARS at later course of the disease but not necessarily applicable to the early stage of the disease. reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results. Although reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is an important laboratory test and should be obtained for all patients with suspected SARS, it may not be useful and practical for screening purposes. Nearly 70% of the SARS patients exhibited the characteristic time sequence of symptoms: myalgia and loose stool or diarrhea around the onset of fever, without coryza or sore throat, followed by progressive lower respiratory tract symptoms. Similar clinical presentation was observed in only 3.2% of the control group.
