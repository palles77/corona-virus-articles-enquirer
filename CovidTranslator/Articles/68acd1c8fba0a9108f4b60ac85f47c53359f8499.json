DQP-1105 inhibited GluN2C-and GluN2D-containing receptors with IC 50 values that were at least 50-fold lower than those for recombinant GluN2A-, GluN2B-, GluA1-, or GluK2containing receptors. Inhibition was voltage-independent and could not be surmounted by increasing concentrations of either coagonist, glutamate or glycine, consistent with a noncompetitive mechanism of action. DQP-1105 inhibited single-channel currents in excised outside-out patches without significantly changing mean open time or single-channel conductance, suggesting that DQP inhibits a pregating step without changing the stability of the open pore conformation and thus channel closing rate. Evaluation of DQP-1105 inhibition of chimeric NMDA receptors identified two key residues in the lower lobe of the GluN2 agonist binding domain that control the selectivity of DQP-1105. These data suggest a mechanism for this new class of inhibitors and demonstrate that ligands can access, in a subunit-selective manner, a new site located in the lower, membrane-proximal portion of the agonist-binding domain.",

            "text": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors belong to the family of ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate the majority of excitatory neuronal transmission within the central nervous system . NMDA receptors comprise four subunits that combine to form functional ion channels. Each subunit folds into four semiautonomous domains, including the amino-terminal domain, the ligand-binding domain, the transmembrane domain, and the carboxyl-terminal domain. Functional NMDA receptors are formed by the assembly of two GluN1 subunits that bind the coagonist glycine together with two GluN2 subunits that bind the coagonist gluta-mate. Four independent genes encoding GluN2 subunits have been identified (GluN2A-D) and account for differences in functional properties of the NMDA receptors, including deactivation time course, agonist potency, mean open time, and open probability (Dingledine et al., 1999; Chen and Wyllie, 2006; Paoletti and Neyton, 2007; Traynelis et al., 2010) . The GluN2 subunit also controls the sensitivity of the receptor to Mg 2\u03e9 block, proton inhibition, modulation by Zn 2\u03e9 , as well as potency and efficacy of the endogenous agonists glutamate and glycine .",

Despite considerable progress in our understanding of ionotropic glutamate receptor structure and function, the lack of subunit-selective pharmacological tools targeting NMDA receptors has impeded advances in understanding the roles of different GluN2-containing NMDA receptor subtypes both in normal brain function and in various disease states. Here we report a new structural class of antagonists, typified by 4-(5-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(6-methyl-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid (DQP-1105), which is approximately 50-fold selective for GluN2C units/ml penicillin, and 10 g/ml streptomycin. HEK cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) with cDNAs encoding green fluorescent protein, GluN1, and GluN2A or GluN2D at a ratio of 1:1:1 and 0.5 g/well total cDNA for 16 to 24 h before whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were conducted, as described previously (Yuan et al., 2009) . After transfection, cells were incubated in media supplemented with NMDA receptor antagonists DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (200 M) and 7-chlorokynurenic acid (200 M) . BHK-21 cells (American Type Culture Collection; hereafter BHK cells) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 1 mg/ml G418, 10 g/ml blasticidin, 200 M 7-chlorokynurenic acid, and 200 M D-(\u03ea)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid.",

One day before the experiment, the cells were seeded in 20 l of media at 6 \u03eb 10 5 cells/ml in black, clear-bottomed 384-well plates (CellBind; Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA) using a Multidrop 384 Reagent Dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). On the day of the experiment, the media was gently aspirated by a 384-format Biomek liquid handler (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The cells were then loaded with Fluo-4 \"no wash\" (Invitrogen) dissolved in HEPES-buffered saline (Invitrogen) with 2.5 mM (1%) probenecid and 30 M 7-chlorokynurenic acid for 60 min at 37\u00b0C in the dark. Cells were gently washed again with 30 l/well using the same buffer without Fluo-4 dye, and placed in 20 l/well buffer. The cell plates were then loaded into a functional drug-screening system (FDSS7000; Hamamatsu Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ), and realtime recordings of changes in Fluo-4 emission were performed (excitation at 480 nm and emission at 540 nm) at room temperature (20-22\u00b0C). After 10 s of baseline recordings, 10 l/well of 3\u03eb concentrated test compound, controls, or assay buffer in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 1 mM glycine (final concentration) were added. The high glycine concentration will displace the 7-chlorokynurenic acid (Hansen et al., 2010b) . After 2 min, an additional 10 l/well of a 4\u03eb concentrated EC 80 solutions of NMDA (110 M for GluN2A, 100 M for GluN2C, or 30 M for GluN2D) were added; an EC 100 concentration of NMDA (1 mM) was used for GluN2B. Changes in fluorescence were subsequently recorded for 2 min. For determination of the concentration-response relationships, test compounds were 3-fold serially diluted over 10 concentration steps. Responses [fluorescence units (FU) ] were normalized to the first recording and expressed as percentage of NMDA activation (no inhibition) and NMDA plus 100 M dizocilpine maleate (MK801) as 100% inhibition according to Inhibition (%) \u03ed (1 \u03ea (FU TEST \u03ea FU MK801 )/(FU NMDA \u03ea FU MK801 )) \u03eb 100) (1) ABBREVIATIONS: NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MK801, dizocilpine maleate; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N\u0408,N\u0408-tetraacetic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank; AMPA, \u2423-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; DQP, dihydroquinolone-pyrazoline-containing; DQP-997, 3; 4-(3-(6-bromo-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-5-(4-bromophenyl)-4,5dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1105, 19; 4-(5-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(6-methyl-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1209, 9; 4-(3-(6-bromo-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1Hpyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1210, 22; 4-(3-(6-bromo-4-phenylquinolin-3-yl)-5-(4-bromophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1308, 18; 4-(3-(6-methyl-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1309, 21; 6-bromo-3-(5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-propionyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-4-phenylquinolin-2(1H)-one; DQP-1177, 25; 4-(3-(4-bromophenyl)-5-(6methyl-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1178, 8; 4-(3-(6-bromo-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1183, 1; 4-(3-(6-bromo-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1, 2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1184, 2; 4-(3-(6-bromo-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3yl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1185, 5; 4-(3-(6-bromo-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-5-(ptolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-2003, 7; 4-(3-(6-bromo-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-5-(2, 5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1250, 24; 3-(1-acetyl-5-(4-bromophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-6methyl-4-phenylquinolin-2(1H)-one) and; DQP-2005, 20; 4-(5-(2-methoxyphenyl)-3-(6-methyl-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-4,5dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-2033, 4; 4-(3-(6-bromo-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-4, 5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid; DQP-1128, 6; 4-(3-(6-bromo-2-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)-5-(4methoxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-oxobutanoic acid.",

That is, openings that showed direct transition between two conductance levels were treated as having a single duration. Although all patches contained several active channels, only a minority of openings (\u03f31%) were due to simultaneous opening of two or more channels.

The comparative homology modeling program MODELLER 9v1 (Sali and Blundell, 1993 ) was used to generate homology models for the GluN1/GluN2D and GluN1/ GluN2A containing NMDA receptors. A protein family alignment was generated using the rat sequences for the NMDA receptors (GluN1, GluN2A-D), AMPA receptors (GRIA1-4), and kainate receptors (GRIK1-5). The MUSCLE alignment program was used to align the sequences and was subsequently used in model construction (Edgar, 2004) . The crystal structure of the AMPA receptor GluA2 (PDB entry 3KG2; 3.60-\u00c5 resolution) was used as template, which served as a scaffold to build an NMDA receptor that includes the amino-terminal domain, the ligand binding domain, and the transmembrane domain. The symmetry used in the construction of the models is the same as that suggested by Sobolevsky et al. (2009) : Chain A,C \u03ed GluN1; Chain B,D \u03ed GluN2. Because of a low overall homology between GluA2 and the NMDA receptors, multiple templates were used (19% sequence identity between GluA2 and GluN2D and 23% sequence identity between GluA2 and GluN1). The resolved structure for the monomeric ATD of GluN2B (Karakas et al., 2009 ; PDB entry 3JPY; 3.21-\u00c5 resolution) was used as a template to model the amino-terminal domain of both GluN1 and GluN2 (sequence identities of 14 and 23%, respectively). The structure of the ligand binding domain of the GluN1 and GluN2A complex (PDB entry 2A5T; 2.00-\u00c5 resolution; GT-linker removed) was used as a template to model the respective domain in the GluN1/GluN2D models (Furukawa et al., 2005) . The transmembrane region was modeled based on the AMPA coordinates, the unresolved regions being omitted. The model was subjected to quality analysis using PDB sum generator (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbsum; Laskowski, 2009 ). The analysis revealed some discrepancy in the overall G factors between the crystal structure (0.32) and the GluN1/GluN2D (\u03ea0.29) model, which is expected for models built on low-resolution structures with low homology; scores above \u03ea0.5 are considered acceptable.",

            "text": "Structure Activity Relationship for Dihydroquinolone-Pyrazolines. The dihydroquinilone-pyrazoline scaffold was identified as an inhibitor of NMDA receptors from a multiwell Ca 2\u03e9 -based screen of approximately 10 5 compounds from ChemDiv and Asinex diversity libraries against GluN1/GluN2C-or GluN1/GluN2D-expressing BHK cell lines (Hansen et al., 2010b) . Evaluation of a subset of analogs sharing this scaffold led to the identification of DQP-1105 ( Fig. 1A) , which is the primary focus of this study. Various substitution patterns of the dihydroquinolone-pyrazolinecontaining scaffold (Table 1 ) affect potency and selectivity and reveal several key features of the ligand-receptor interactions. Beginning from the initial screening hit (compound 3), we evaluated the IC 50 value at four different recombinant NMDA receptors for analogs that altered substituents at five positions as a starting point for assessing the structureactivity relationship. The IC 50 values of compound 3 ranged from 2.7 M at GluN2D-containing receptors to \u03fe75 M at GluN2A when evaluated at recombinant receptors expressed in X. laevis oocytes. Evaluation of various substitutions on the C-ring while the A-ring R 1 bromine was held constant showed that the R 4 -bromo (compound 3) is the most favorable configuration. Substituting R 1 of the A-ring with a methyl group led to compound 19, referred hereafter to as DQP-1105, which shows the most favorable combination of potency and selectivity for GluN2D over GluN2A and GluN2B of all of the analogs tested. We also evaluated core structural perturbations to better understand the requirements of activity (Table 2) . Beginning with analogs of the initial screening hit (compound 3), truncation of the acyl-chain off the pyrazoline nitrogen from an acid to an ethyl group (compound 21) elim-Noncompetitive NMDA GluN2C/D Subunit-Selective Antagonists inated antagonist activity. Likewise, removal of the succinate group and substituting with R 1 -methyl analog (compound 24) abolishes activity. Removing the oxo-functionality from the quinoline (compound 22), which removes a resonance form, also eliminates activity (Table 2) . Thus, the position of the imine within the pyrazoline compound as well as the connectivity, length, and charge of the acyl chain are important features for potency and selectivity. We selected DQP-1105 (compound 19) as the compound with the best combination of potency and selectivity to study in terms of mechanism of action.",

We have evaluated the actions of DQP-1105 against current responses from recombinant NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors expressed in X. laevis oocytes ( Fig. 1B ; Table 3 ) to determine its potency and selectivity across the glutamate receptor ion channel family. When coapplied in solutions containing maximally effective concentrations of glutamate and glycine, DQP-1105 inhibited recombinant NMDA receptors containing the GluN1/GluN2C and GluN1/GluN2D subunits with IC 50 values that were lower than that for inhibition of GluN1/ GluN2A (Table 3) . For example, in X. laevis oocytes, DQP-1105 inhibited GluN1/GluN2D receptors with an IC 50 value of 2.7 \u03ee 0.2 M (mean \u03ee S.E.M.; n \u03ed 44), whereas it had minimal effects on GluN1/GluN2A. The IC 50 value at GluN1/ GluN2A determined by fitting each concentration-effect curve was at a minimum 206 \u03ee 36 M, and might be higher, because responses from some oocytes showed no inhibition and thus could not be fitted and included in this analysis (n \u03ed 13; Fig. 1B ; Table 3 ). IC 50 values determined at recombinant human and rat NMDA receptors were similar (Table 3) . DQP-1105 had minimal effects on current responses of homomeric GluA1 AMPA receptors or homomeric GluK2 kainate receptors (Table 1) , and no effect on the leak currents in uninjected X. laevis oocytes (n \u03ed 4; data not shown), or on the leak currents from oocytes expressing NMDA receptors (n \u03ed 4; data not shown).",

Because we had observed selectivity in both oocytes and BHK cells in which the intracellular milieu had not been disrupted by dialysis, we reasoned that the whole-cell patch recording configuration, which is known to enhance NMDA receptor desensitization (Sather et al., 1990) (Fig. 2, compare A and B) , may have artificially increased the potency of DQP-1105 on GluN2A receptors. To test this idea, we used perforated patch recordings in which electrical ac-cess to the cell was obtained through gramicidin pores (Ebihara et al., 1995) . This configuration allows measurements of whole-cell currents without changing the intracellular composition. As predicted, we observed considerable selectivity between glutamate-activated GluN2D-containing (IC 50 , 2.1 M) over GluN2A-containing (IC 50 54 M) NMDA receptors when we recorded using perforated patches (Table 3 ). This observation suggests that dialysis of the cytoplasm and perhaps the associated enhancement of desensitization can increase the affinity of DQP-1105 for its binding site. We interpret the differences between the observed IC 50 values for N.E., no effect. N.E., no effect. ",

Furthermore, the EC 50 values for glutamate and glycine at GluN1/GluN2D receptors expressed in X. laevis oocytes were not significantly altered in the presence of an IC 75 concentration of DQP-1105 (5 M). Glutamate EC 50 values in 30 M glycine were 0.30 \u03ee 0.02 and 0.27 \u03ee 0.03 M in the absence and presence of DQP-1105, respectively (p \u03fe 0.05, unpaired t test, n \u03ed 10-11).

            "text": "We subsequently examined the effects of DQP-1105 on the NMDA receptor response time course in whole-cell voltageclamp recordings of GluN1/GluN2D receptors expressed in HEK cells. Current responses were evoked by rapid solution exchange from glycine alone to glycine plus glutamate or NMDA (Fig. 4A) . The current response of GluN1/GluN2D undergoes virtually no desensitization during agonist application, as described previously (Vicini et al., 1998; Wyllie et al., 2008) . Coapplication of agonist plus 0.3 to 30 M DQP-1105 caused concentration-dependent relaxation of the current response (Fig. 4) , with virtually complete inhibition of GluN1/GluN2D responses at 30 M. Concentration-effect curves for the steady-state current responses to the agonist NMDA show that the IC 50 for DQP-1105 inhibition on GluN1/GluN2D receptors was in excellent agreement with that obtained in the other expression systems ( Fig. 4B ; Table  3 ). Coapplication of DQP-1105 with NMDA and glycine induced a relaxation of the current response that could be fitted by a single exponential function. Coapplication of different concentrations of DQP-1105 with NMDA resulted in different time constants ( ONSET ), which we interpret to reflect the time course of association of DQP-1105 with the receptor. In this case, the reciprocal of ONSET should be linearly related to DQP-1105 concentration with a slope equal to k ON and an intercept equal to k OFF . Consistent with this idea, values of 1/ ONSET were significantly correlated with DQP-1105 concentration (r \u03ed 0.996; Pearson's test, p \u03fd 0.005) for GluN1/GluN2D (Fig. 4C ). Regression analysis of this relationship for NMDA-activated GluN1/GluN2D gives values of 4.5 \u03eb 10 5 M \u03ea1 \u2150 s \u03ea1 for k ON and 0.65 s \u03ea1 for k OFF , from which K D can be calculated as 1.4 M, in agreement with the fitted IC 50 value ( Fig. 4C ; Table 3 ). Inhibition by DQP-1105 also was evaluated when GluN1/GluN2D receptors were activated by 100 M glutamate and 30 M glycine. Analysis of the glutamate-activated GluN1/GluN2D response relaxation time course as a function of DQP-1105 concentration yielded similar values for k ON (4.4 \u03eb 10 5 M \u03ea1 \u2150 s \u03ea1 ) and k OFF (1.44 s \u03ea1 ; n \u03ed 6 cells). The resulting K D for DQP-1105 inhibition of glutamate-evoked currents (3.3 M) was similar to the independently determined IC 50 for glutamate-evoked responses (Table 3 ). In addition, the K D and IC 50 values for DQP-1105 inhibition were typically less than 2-fold lower for the partial agonist NMDA-evoked than for glutamate-evoked currents, suggesting the affinity of DQP-1105 is only modestly influenced by agonist efficacy.",

GluN1/GluN2D receptors expressed in HEK cells were recorded under voltage-clamp and activated by rapid 5-s application of 200 M NMDA in the continuous presence of 100 M glycine. The peak and steady-state current responses then were compared with the currents evoked by application of 200 M NMDA after preincubation with 100 M glycine and 3 M DQP-1105 (Fig. 5A) . Even when DQP-1105 was preapplied, the NMDAevoked currents exhibited a pronounced relaxation of the current response, with a peak response of 84 \u03ee 1.9% compared with control and a steady-state response of 21 \u03ee 1.6% compared with control (Fig. 5, A and C; n \u03ed 7) , suggesting that DQP-1105 did not bind with the same affinity in the absence of NMDA. The time course could be described by a single exponential function with a time constant (580 \u03ee 33 ms) that was not significantly different from that obtained with no preapplication of DQP-1105 (530 \u03ee 27 ms; p \u03ed 0.72, unpaired t test; compare Figs. 4A and 5A). By contrast, activation of GluN1/GluN2D by a rapid application of 300 M glycine after preincubation with 20 M NMDA and 3 M DQP-1105 (Fig. 5B ) did not show a pronounced relaxation in current response time course. Rather, the peak response was inhibited to 29 \u03ee 0.9% of control, with a steady-state response of 24 \u03ee 1.6% of control (Fig. 5 , B and C; n \u03ed 5), These recordings displayed a pronounced relaxation of the current response after NMDA binding, with an 84 \u03ee 1.9% peak response compared with control and a steady-state response of 21 \u03ee 1.6% compared with control (n \u03ed 7). B, GluN1/GluN2D receptors were activated by a 5-s application of 300 M glycine in the continuous presence of 20 M NMDA, and subsequently activated by a 5-s application of 300 M glycine in the continuous presence of both 20 M NMDA and 3 M DQP-1105. These recordings did not show a prominent relaxation of response, with a peak response of 29 \u03ee 0.9% compared with control and a steady-state response of 24 \u03ee 1.6% of the control response amplitude (n \u03ed 5). C, although the peak responses of GluN1/GluN2D receptors activated by NMDA or glycine after pretreatment with 3 M DQP-1105 were significantly different (p \u03fd 0.05; paired t test), the steady-state responses (D) were not significantly different (paired t test).

We used this set of chimeric receptors to evaluate the structural determinants of DQP-1105 action and found that transferring the ATD, S1 region of the ligand-binding domain, or the transmembrane elements by themselves (including two transmembrane helices and a reentrant loop) did not render GluN2A containing receptors sensitive to DQP-1105 (Fig. 7, A and B) . By contrast, transferring either the S1-S2 regions or the S2 domain alone from GluN2D to GluN2A completely transferred the DQP-1105 sensitivity to GluN2A (Fig. 7 , A and B), suggesting structural determinants that define subunit selectivity may be contained within the S2 region of GluN2D. This result is surprisingly similar to the structural determinants for neurosteroids (Jang et al., 2004; Horak et al., 2006) and the structurally unrelated quinazolin-4-ones (Hansen and Traynelis, 2011) . Consistent with this result, experiments in which the GluN2D subunit ATD has been removed show that the ATD is not involved in the selectivity of DQP-1105 for GluN2D over GluN2A (Fig. 7, A and B) .",

This strategy allowed us to examine whether clusters of residues that are divergent between GluN2D and GluN2A affect DQP-1105 selectivity. We found that the S2a, S2b, and S2c chimeric receptors exhibited reduced sensitivity to DQP-1105 when tested at a single concentration, suggesting that some of the nine divergent residues between GluN2A and GluN2D within these three regions control DQP-1105 potency at the receptor. Subsequent mutation of each of these divergent residue in GluN2D to that observed in Glun2A identified two amino acids (GluN2D Gln701 and Leu705) that significantly reduced in-hibition (Fig. 7E ). Concentration-effect curves showed that GluN2D(Q701Y) and GluN2D(L705F) decreased the potency of DQP-1105 more than 6-fold to 19 \u03ee 2 M (n \u03ed 8) and 17 \u03ee 2 M (n \u03ed 8), respectively. These data suggest that DQP-1105 shares structural determinants with quinazolin-4-ones (Hansen and Traynelis, 2011) and perhaps neurosteroids (Horak et al., 2006) , identifying this region as a site at which structurally diverse endogenous and exogenous ligands can interact.",

Inhibition occurs without actions on the stability of the open state or the channel closing rate. Rather, binding of DQP-1105, presumably to the GluN2 subunit, reduces the frequency of channel openings without other actions. We also show, unexpectedly, that the structural determinants of selectivity for DQP-1105 reside within a portion of the S2 region of GluN2D that overlaps closely with previously identified structural determinants important in the selectivity of quinazolin-4-ones, another class of GluN2C/D-preferring antagonists (Hansen and Traynelis, 2011) . In addition, the shared reliance of quinazolin-4-ones, dihydroquinolone-pyrazolines, and neurosteroids on the lower lobe of the ligandbinding domain clamshell indicate that this region is an important site at which channel gating can be controlled (Jang et al., 2004) . These data also show that the allosteric binding site(s) in this region can accommodate a wide range of structurally diverse, negative modulators, which increases the likelihood that well tolerated and potentially therapeutically useful subunit-selective NMDA receptor antagonists can be developed. Furthermore, the findings presented here provide support for a previously unknown antagonist binding site that does not involve the amino-terminal domain, the well conserved agonist recognition sites, or residues within the channel pore. That is, this new site is distinct from ",

Of these, only one other class of noncompetitive GluN2C/D antagonist has been reported with potency in the low micromolar range and greater than 20-fold selectivity over NMDA receptors composed of other GluN2 subunits, AMPA receptors, and kainate receptors. That class, which contains the previously identified AMPA antagonist quinazolin-4-one backbone (Mosley et al., 2010) , is chemically distinct from DQP-1105 yet shares similar structural determinants of action and a similar mechanism, in that glutamate/NMDA binding enhances antagonist potency (Hansen and Traynelis, 2011) . Structural determinants within NMDA receptor subunits have not been defined for other GluN2C/D-preferring antagonists, apart from the suggestion that the S2 region of the ligand binding domain is important in their actions (Horak et al., 2006; Costa et al., 2010) .

The data from our single channel analysis, as well as the structural determinants that were identified, support the idea that DQP-1105 could interfere with a crucial gating step that leads to an increase in the energy barrier for the transition from the closed to the open state for DQP-1105-bound receptors. Moreover, we have previously proposed that the GluN2C/D ligand binding domain closure around glutamate can increase the potency for quinazolin-4-one antagonists (Hansen and Traynelis, 2011) , which share structural determinants of selectivity with DQP-1105. In this model, residues implicated by site-directed mutagenesis as being important for the actions of inhibitors, including the residues identified in this study, are close enough to the linkers (S1-M1 and M3-S2) connecting the transmembrane helices to the proximal region of the ligand binding domain to influence their movement (Fig. 8) . Numerous studies have shown that structural determinants near or within the linker regions modulate receptor gating (Krupp et al., 1998; Yuan et al., 2005; Talukder et al., 2010) . Most recently, specific residues within the S1-M1, M3-S2, and S2-M4 linker regions were suggested to serve as potential targets for allosteric modulators (Talukder et al., 2010) . Our identification of residues in the vicinity of the extracellular end of the transmembrane linkers raises the possibility that DQP-1105 and related analogs could interact with both the ligand binding domain and portions of the linker regions to negatively modulate the receptors.",

Concentration-effect curves at GluN1/GluN2D, GluN1/GluN2A, GluN1/ GluN2A(2D-S1S2), GluN1/GluN2A(2D-S1), and GluN1/GluN2A(2D-S2), B, GluN1/ GluN2A(2D-M1M2M3), GluN1/GluN2A(2D-ATD), and GluN1/GluN2A(\u232cATD) receptors were analyzed, and the mean IC 50 values (\u03ee S.E.M.) are shown. These data suggest that the S2 region transfers DQP-1105 sensitivity to GluN2A. C, linear representation of the S2 regions of GluN2A(2D-S2) in which regions of GluN2D-S2 have been reverted to that of GluN2A to probe for loss of inhibition of DQP-1105. D, the inhibition produced by 5 M DQP-1105 in the presence of 1000 M glutamate and 300 M glycine is shown as a percent of control. Three chimeric receptors show significantly reduced inhibition compared with GuN2A(S2) chimera (p \u03fd 0.05, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's test, n \u03ed 5-13 oocytes per chimeric receptor). E, site-directed mutagenesis of residues within GluN2D S2 chimeric regions identified Gln701 and Leu705 (asterisks in B) as key structural determinants for antagonist activity of DQP-1105 at GluN2D receptors (p \u03fd 0.05, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's test; n \u03ed 4-11 oocytes per mutant receptor).",

However, no crystallographic data exist for GluN2C, and the region identified in chimeric receptors shows a high degree of chain flexibility in the crystallographic structure of the isolated GluN2D ligand binding domain (Vance et al., 2011) . Moreover, whereas we conclude that GluN2D residues Gln701 and Leu705 control the selectivity between GluN2A and GluN2D, the determinants of GluN2C selectivity have yet to be explored in depth. One of the residues important for GluN2D selectivity (Leu705) is a conserved Phe in GluN2A/ B/C, suggesting this residue does not contribute to selectivity for GluN2C over GluN2A. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that these residues may form or influence part of the binding pocket for DQP-1105 and related analogs. The finding that the DQP class of molecules shares structural determinants with the previously identified quinazolin-4ones suggests that potent and selective molecules incorporating functionality from both groups might be developed through medicinal chemistry efforts. Fig. 8 . Homology models of GluN1-GluN2 receptors shows that residues identified in lower lobe of the clamshell shaped ligand binding domain are localized near each other in three-dimensional space and in close proximity to the linkers that connect the ligand binding domain to the transmembrane helices. A, left, a GluN1-GluN2D receptor homology model (ATD omitted); right, shows a GluN1-GluN2A homology model (ATD omitted). B, the GluN2D-subunit is expanded (left) to show the lower portion of the ligand-binding domain containing residues Gln701 and Leu705 (red), which are critical divergent structural determinants for the antagonist activity of DQP-1105. The S1-M1 and M3-S2 linker regions are also shown in red. A GluN2A-subunit is expanded (right) to show the same region with the residues corresponding to GluN2D-Gln701(Tyr in GluN2A, yellow) and GluN2D-Leu705 (Phe in GluN2A yellow); linkers are also shown in yellow. Compound DQP-1105 is shown in the lower panel on the same scale.",
