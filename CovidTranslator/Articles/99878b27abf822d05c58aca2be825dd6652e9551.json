The shale boom in the US was a game changer, as was the election of Donald Trump as US president. Trump pushed an ambitious \"America first\" agenda aimed at transforming the US into a global energy superpower. The purpose of this article is two-fold: first, it outlines the key pillars of the emerging global energy order. Second, it underscores the role of contingent events, a factor neglected by some previous studies because of their reliance on what A.O.Hirschman (1970) termed \"paradigmatic thinking\". The recent transition in the international energy order is an outcome of two paramount, yet largely unanticipated events: the shale revolution in the US and Trump's neomercantilist and unilateralist economic policies. While contingencies are an inherent feature of social reality, the scenario approach can be a useful heuristic for dealing with uncertainties. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these developments for global energy governance.",

The administration of President Trump is set to convert the US from a net energy importer into a global energy superpower. To this end, the US has increased exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Asian markets and pushed European countries to buy natural gas from US producers as a putative way to reduce European dependence on Russian gas supplies. At the same time, the US withdrew from a number of binding international environmental commitments, notably the Paris Climate Agreement. In dealing with unfriendly oil exporters, Venezuela and Iran, the US imposed sanctions and used coercive diplomacy.",

The combination of these factors contributed to a major systemic transformation in global energy with wide-ranging and long-lasting policy implications. Some experts believe that this profound shift will \"redraw the geopolitical map of the 21 st century\" (IRENA, 2019, 14) and undermine the power of long-term energy producers. This raises the question: What implications do these changes have for the global energy system? And what accounts for the recent shift in the international energy regime to a new energy order characterized by the rise of the US as a net energy exporter, the relative abundance of energy resources and the persistence of low oil prices?",

Drawing on Krasner's earlier formulation, Colgan and collaborators (2012) argue that shifts in energy regime complexes follow a path-dependent pattern and are best captured by the punctuated equilibrium model. In their account, institutional change is driven by the degree of dissatisfaction of major oil importing or exporting states which in turn is determined by rational calculations of substantial revenue loss that the government risks to incur. They argue that \" [d] uring periods of high oil prices (e.g., 1973-81; 2003-2010) , we expect to see dissatisfied energy-importing states acting to change institutional arrangements to handle contemporary problems. Conversely, in periods of low oil prices (e.g., 1985-86, 1998) , we expect to see dissatisfied energy-exporting states acting to change institutional arrangements\" (Colgan et al., 2012, 133) .",

The new status of the US in the nascent oil order evades easy categorization into an exporter-importer binary. Bolstered by the surge in shale gas and oil production, the US has opted out of multilateral climate commitments and rolled back about 90 federal environmental regulations (Popovich et al., 2019) . The Trump administration has acted unilaterally, rather than through international organizations, to pursue US energy interests. On the one hand, there is a certain degree of continuity on climate policy with previous US administrations ( MacNeil and Paterson, 2020) , and there were precedents, notably the failure of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. On the other hand, the Trump administration's rollbacks on Obama-era environmental policies and the retreat from a number of international environmental treaties (Seo, 2019) is a manifestation of the erosion of the international energy regime as a global regulatory framework. Most importantly, Trump's actions undermine US leadership of international climate regime and hurts multilateral efforts to curb greenhouse emissions (Bordoff, 2017) . This observation is generally in line with the contention in recent International Relations scholarship that the US-led post-World War II international liberal order appears to be in disarray. After the election of Trump in 2016, the US displayed apparent aversion to membership and participation in multilateral trade regimes, military security alliances, human rights and environmental agreements (Ikenberry, 2018) .",

The surge in shale oil and gas production has transformed the US energy industry and turned the US into an energy superpower capable of competing with traditional energy producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the ascent of the US as a new energy superpower is reshaping the world energy map. The increase in energy production in the US and other new producers means there is enough oil to match the world demand for fossil fuels keeping global oil prices low. Lower oil prices appear to weaken the geopolitical leverage that traditional energy exporters -OPEC plus Russiaused to enjoy for almost half a century (Blackwill and O'Sullivan, 2014) . Moreover, a bigger share of renewables and low-carbon sources in the energy mixes of leading industrialized economies is expected to make a greater number of countries energy self-sufficient in the long run. Lower energy prices already hit hard the fiscal balances of traditional oil and gas producers, most of which are governed by authoritarian regimes (Ross, 2014) . Fiscal dependence on oil revenue makes oil-dependent states vulnerable to external shocks, and their survival hinges on the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund (SWF). SWFs are state-owned investment funds that accumulate, among other assets, state revenues from mineral wealth. These reserve funds provide autocratic governments with a protection cushion shielding them against adverse oil price shocks in periods of oil price hikes (Ahmadov, 2019) .",

            "text": "In the worst case scenario, the consequences of the coveted transition to renewables and low-carbon alternatives for oil exporters will be dire. In the long run, a decline in fossil fuel demand is likely to push the oil price down making extraction of such resources commercially unattractive (Manley et al., 2017) . While renewables or low-carbon sources have grown fast, an even partial transition to renewables by 2050 seems unrealistic (REN21 2017). The global fossil fuel system, according to IRENA (2019, 64), relies on a massive built-in infrastructure of oil wells, pipelines, tankers and refineries. This stock of physical assets worth US $25 trillion may be stranded due to technological innovations and government efforts to switch to renewables and low-carbon alternatives. Van de Graaf and Bradshaw (2018) predict that the established oil producers might \"end up with lower future revenues from [their] assets (the bursting of the 'carbon bubble'), capital investments in oil infrastructure that cannot be recovered because of reduced demand or reduced prices ('stranded assets') and existing oil reserves that are left unexploited ('unburnable oil reserves')\" (1322). On the other hand, the interlocking web of infrastructure, technologies and institutions underpinning the existing fossil fuel-based system creates a path-dependent process of 'carbon lock-in' which inhibits transitions toward low-carbon alternatives (Seto et al., 2016) .",

The 2004-2014 commodity price boom encouraged companies to invest in exploration and production in previously technologically inaccessible areas, such as deep shelves of the Caspian Sea and offshore fields in Latin America, West Africa and the Arctic (Kemp, 2015) . The increase of supply from traditional sources and the diversification of energy sources led to excess supply of fossil fuels in international energy markets. For example, in 2018, the so-called Big Three (Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US) saw oil output reach record levels (IEA, 2018; IEA, 2018b) . The oversupply of oil and gas from North American sources was one of the drivers for the fall in oil prices in mid-2014. This low-price constellation continues to this day. The Brent crude prices that averaged US $111 per barrel (bbl) in 2011-2012 fell to as low as 52 $/bbl in 2015 and hovered around 44-71 $/bbl in the following three years (BP Statistical Review of Energy, 2019). The global outbreak of coronavirus since the start of 2020 and shrinking oil demand have driven crude prices further down. On March 6, 2020, at an OPEC \u00fe meeting in Vienna Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to negotiate production cuts of 1.5 million bbl/d which caused Brent crude prices to plunge to below 36 $/bbl (Kotsev, 2020) .",

Since the 1970s, America shifted from being an oil producer to being an importer of oil. In 1956, geologist M. King Hubbert formulated the 'peak oil' theory which predicted the bell-shaped curve of US oil production that would peak around 1965 and decline in the early 1970s. Peak oil theory underpinned much of US energy strategy in the 1950s and 1960s fueling a concern that oil resources are nearing its end. Hence, the strategic significance US policymakers attached to the Persian Gulf energy reserves that have since then been seen as vital to US national security (Hendrix, 2018) . Formulated in 1980, the Carter doctrine states that \"an attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force\" (Davis, 2017) . In contrast to the current \"energy dominance\" doctrine, the US policy traditionally focused on domestic conservation and the reliance on supplies from foreign sources. In the wake of the 1970s oil shocks, the US enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) and the Export Administration Act of 1979, curtailing the ability of domestic oil producers to export crude (Hendrix, 2018) . This ban was lifted in 2015.",

President Trump made it clear that an increase in American LNG imports by European countries would undermine Russia's monopoly of gas supplies and \"make that continent less vulnerable to political blackmail\" (Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, 2017, 10). President Trump has reportedly criticized European leaders for supporting the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, saying it would give Moscow too much influence over Germany. Trump threatened to use sanctions against companies that help construct the gas pipeline project. \"It will be a disaster for Europe to ditch Nord Stream 2 under U. S. pressure,\" said Rainer Seele, CEO of Austrian energy company OMV financing Nord Stream 2. The Russian gas via Nord Stream 2 is cheaper than US LNG and US pressure, he said, threatens \"Europe's independence and security of energy supplies\" (Gardner and de Carbonnel, 2019) . Other energy experts also doubted that America can compete with cheaper Russian gas: \"The cost of liquefying gas in the United States and transporting it to Europe doubles its price for American companies. So if they were to sell to customers in Europe at current prices, they would lose money\" (Reed, 2018) .",

The creation of IEA in 1974 following the Arab Embargo a year earlier was a reaction to shortage of gasoline and high oil prices. For example, the rise in oil prices since the turn of the millennium incentivized oil importing countries led by the US to create new institutional arrangements including the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Partnership on Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC). In this view, institutional innovation and creation is driven by the dissatisfaction of major players with oil market prices.",

State capitalism has come to replace the previous 'neoliberal order' that was in place from 1986-2000, according to Van De Graaf's periodization. The 'state-capitalist' order (2000s onwards) is characterized by rising oil prices and resource nationalism. Resource nationalism refers to the shift of revenueas well as relative power-away from international oil companies in favor of the host government's greater control over national resource development in what Vernon (1971) saw as an 'obsolescing bargain' (Stevens, 2008, 5) . This echoes the recent assessment in which national oil companies (NOCs) are viewed as crucial players in key oil producing countries including Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Venezuela. As of 2017, NOCs estimated to have accumulated combined assets of $3.1 trillion. Saudi Aramco alone had net income [in 2018] of over $100 billion (Heller et al., 2019) .",

This fueled an academic and policy debate about the relative merits of state versus multinationals in managing oil earnings. Scholars like Ross (1999; have argued that state control is associated with suboptimal outcomes and inefficient management of a country's leading resource sector.

It is clear that the Trump administration opted for unilateral action and disregarded international cooperation on energy and climate change issues. While Trump's aversion to international institutions is not unusual in US history (consider the Bush administration's renunciation of the Kyoto Protocol), it is distinguishable by the scale of a rollback on climate obligations and its harmful effects on international efforts to curtail climate change. Turning inwards, the Trump administration has been preoccupied with promoting domestic energy companies and lifting pre-existing environmental regulations and commitments including Paris Climate Agreement and disengaging from other multilateral organizations. In short, Trump's administration proceeded unilaterally instead of trying to bring about a new institutional model.",

Just before a fracking-boosted oil boom occurred in the US in 2007, the country was preparing to build LNG import terminals whereas just 7 years after the shale revolution the US was building LNG terminals to export oil (Sernovitz, 2016) . \"Even stranger,\" writes an oil industry expert Sernovitz (2016) , \"this U.S. shale renaissance has happened in left-for-dead places like West Texas \u2026 and in places I had forgotten ever had oil and gas. North Dakota now has double the oil production per capita of Kuwait. Eight years ago, it produced less oil than Italy\" (6) . Wang and Krupnick (2013) argue that the key factor was technological innovation in hydraulic fracturing, drilling and geological knowledge that was made possible through US government sponsorship of R&D in developing technologies of extraction of unconventional natural gas. Such investments seem logical in light of the energy security concerns following a series of supply disruptions during the 1970s. The leading role in developing fracking technologies belong to small independent gas firms (e.g., Mitchell Energy, Devon Energy) that contributed large investments in the initial stages of shale gas development (Wang and Krupnick, 2013) .",

Shale producers face financial pressures from investors and shareholders. The irony is that while by increasing production and technological efficiency gains shale companies helped to bring the oil price down, the price of oil needs to be above $70 per barrel to make hydraulic drilling profitable (Morse, 2014) . With the crude oil price in the $50-60 per barrel range after the 2014 price fall, shale companies were failing to deliver returns. Frustrated by poor returns, investors and lenders lose an interest in shale production (Cunningham, 2019) . Limited access to capital hurts drilling companies. In what has been dubbed the \"shale slump\", cash-stripped drillers are forced to close down wells and cut back on drilling operations (Chapa, 2019) . The oil price crash on March 9, 2020 to around $30 per barrel, if sustained, might undermine the shale oil industry leading to bankruptcies (Bordoff, 2020) .",

In a series of scenarios published in 1971-1973, Shell referred to the possibility that power would shift from international oil companies to the oil-producing nations, and this shift could cause a surge in oil prices (Wilkinson and Kupers, 2013) . Shell's scenario planning team also pointed out that smaller oil-producing countries in the Middle East would limit further depletion of petroleum resources for the lack of absorptive capacity to manage the inflows of oil revenues (Jefferson, 2012, 187) . The 1979 oil crisis following the downfall of the Shah in Iran and its aftermath were elements included in Shell scenario thinking from March, 1976, and the emergence of a 'Hard Times' scenario (March 1981) anticipating economic slowdown and the drop in oil prices (Jefferson, 2012, 193; Chermack, 2017, 100-101) .",

Some of the policy implications of this transformation include the following: -As energy transitions to low-carbon and renewable energy sources advance, more countries are expected to become energy selfsufficient in the long run. The pace of a low-carbon transition will depend on a multitude of factors, and the inertia of carbon lock-in will militate against it. -The surge in shale production in the US reduced its import dependence on supplies from the Middle East and other regions. Shale development in Northern America is thus weakening the power of traditional energy producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela. -An excess supply from the US and other new producers is likely to keep oil prices low. Lower prices will reduce the fiscal revenue base of traditional oil and gas producers. Elites in these countries will be pushed hard to diversify the economy or otherwise face the risk of fiscal crisis and social instability. -The US is now competing with traditional energy producers for export markets in Europe and Asia and has tightened sanctions against Iran and Venezuela. To secure its energy export interests abroad, the US might be tempted to use coercive diplomacy against market competitors.",

While contingencies are an inherent feature of social reality, the scenario approach can be a useful heuristic for dealing with uncertainties. 2) Incremental technological advancessuch as rock fracturingcan sometimes lead to revolutionary transformations; these sorts of technological innovations are key to understanding the processes driving energy transitions. 3) An emerging energy order appears to be less institutionalized than is commonly believed; the US withdrawal from multilateral agreements threatens the continued existence of liberal institutionalism; perhaps, we will see a greater fragmentation of the liberal order and its replacement with a multipolar one dominated by China, Russia and other major powers.",
