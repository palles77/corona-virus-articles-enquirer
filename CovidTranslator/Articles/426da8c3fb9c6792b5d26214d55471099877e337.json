As a definitive treatment regimen has never been thoroughly evaluated for coronavirus infections, there is an urgent need to rapidly identify potential therapeutics to address future cases of nCoV. To determine an intervention strategy, the effect of interferon-a2b and ribavirin on nCoV isolate hCoV-EMC/2012 replication in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells was evaluated. hCoV-EMC/2012 was sensitive to both interferon-a2b and ribavirin alone in Vero and LLC-MK2 cells, but only at relatively high concentrations; however, when combined, lower concentrations of interferon-a2b and ribavirin achieved comparable endpoints. Thus, a combination of interferon-a2b and ribavirin, which are already commonly used in the clinic, may be useful for patient management in the event of future nCoV infections.",

A dose dependent reduction in genome copies was observed for IFN-a2b treatment with a 0.53-log reduction in viral loads at 500 U/ml reaching a 1.84-log reduction at 5000 U/ml (Figure 2A) .

For Vero cells, this was reduced to 62 U/ml IFN-a2b and 12 mg/ml ribavirin with the absence of CPE at and above 125 U/ml IFN-a2b and 25 mg/ml ribavirin ( Figure 1A ).

Given the genetic relationship of hCoV-EMC/ 2012 to other bat coronaviruses 5 , one can speculate that bats may be the reservoir of this virus; however, additional host species should be considered. With documented human-to-human transmission in close contact situations, and the first documented mild case 22 , there is a real concern that we could be observing the 'tip of the iceberg' and perhaps the start of an epidemic. Regardless, with a 65% case-fatality rate despite intensive medical intervention, therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Despite the significant increase in research on coronaviruses since the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2003, there is no definitive antiviral or therapeutic treatment for coronavirus infections in humans. Pegylated interferon-a was shown to be an effective prophylactic treatment against infection with SARS-CoV in cynomolgus macaques, but was less effective when administered post exposure 23 . No other therapeutics have been tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in a higher order animal model. In the SARS-CoV mouse model, poly IC:LC 24 and mDEF201 (an adenovirus expressing mouse IFN-a) 25 can protect mice from lethal disease; however, neither of these approaches yields an immediate therapeutic for use in humans. Poly IC:LC has been tested in numerous clinical trials, but is not currently approved for treatment of any human disease. Adenovirus-based therapy has multiple complicating factors, such as pre-existing immunity, that have not been adequately addressed, nor is it approved for use in humans 26 .",

The lack of a standard dosing regimen for ribavirin makes comparisons difficult 18 ; however, low dose ribavirin (400-600 mg/day) therapy was shown to be ineffective likely due to an insufficient plasma concentration 40 . In contrast, when used at higher doses other studies have found that ribavirin alone reduced viral loads in over half of the patients and when combined with the viral protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir, patients had a lower incidence of adverse outcomes 16 unclear whether ribavirin alone was effective against SARS-CoV 41 . Alfacon-1, a synthetic IFN-a, has also been suggested to be beneficial to patients 17 . Unfortunately, all of these studies suffer from the confounding use of corticosteroids in doses that vary among studies making a definitive treatment elusive. It has been suggested that combination of interferon and ribavirin treatment should be evaluated 18 . While ribavirin can result in reversible hemolytic anemia, this complication typically occurs following longer treatment protocols 35, 42 . This suggests that short-course ribavirin therapy for an acute infection such as nCoV may not be a significant complication as mild anemia was the most frequently reported side effect during ribavirin treatment for Lassa virus infection 43 .",

The levels of IFNa-2b and ribavirin required for inhibition of nCoV replication must be achievable in humans in order to be relevant for clinical use. In humans, an interferon concentration of 100-750 IU/ml has been observed after intravenous injection of up to 3 3 10 7 U 46,47 , while 24 mg/ml of ribavirin is achievable following a 1000 mg intravenous dose 35 . Here IFN-a2b and ribavirin alone were shown to have an antiviral effect against hCoV-EMC/2012; however, in Vero cells the concentrations required to achieve a beneficial effect are likely higher than what is achievable in humans. When combined, the inhibitory concentration of both IFNa-2b and ribavirin drops to ranges that are likely achievable in humans, suggesting that the combination is a potential treatment option. Used early in the course of infection or given prophylactically to close contacts of sick individuals (close contact transmission has been documented in infection chains) this combination may improve clinical outcomes. In addition, reduced viral load would also likely translate to reduced virus shedding; thus, reducing the risk of secondary transmission. As these two drugs are currently used together in the clinic, combination therapy including IFN-a2b and ribavirin should be considered for case patient management of new nCoV cases and possibly for prophylaxis in highly exposed individuals.",

HCoV-EMC was subsequently propagated on Vero cells using DMEM as above with 2% FBS (complete DMEM). Antiviral assays. Confluent Vero and LLC-MK2 cells in 24-well culture plates (Costar, Corning, NY ) were infected in triplicate with hCoV-EMC/2012 diluted in complete DMEM at an MOI 5 0.001. Following 1 h adsorption at 37uC, the inoculum was removed and the cells were washed 3 times with DMEM. Subsequently, complete DMEM containing IFN-a2b (0-5000 U/ml) (PBL Interferon Source, Piscataway, NJ) and/or ribavirin (0-2000 mg/ml) (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) was added to the cells. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37uC, 5% CO 2 in a humidified environment and the supernatant was removed, an aliquot was inactivated with AVL (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) for viral load quantification and the remainder was stored at 280uC for subsequent virus titration. The supernatant was replaced with fresh complete DMEM containing IFN-a2b and/or ribavirin. Supernatant was also collected at 72 h and 120 h. Five days post-infection representative wells were photographed to document cytopathic effect (CPE) and cells were subsequently collected for protein analysis in 43 SDS-PAGE loading buffer.",
