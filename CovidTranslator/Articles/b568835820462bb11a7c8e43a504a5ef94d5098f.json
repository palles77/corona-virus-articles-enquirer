Unresolved questions about corporate links have been raised about expert advisers to the FSA, the European Food Safety Authority, WHO's International Programme on Chemical Safety, and the international Codex Alimentarius Commission. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] The fi rst FSA Board (May, 2000) had 14 members, of whom fi ve declared relevant personal interests. 11 In December, 2007, fi ve of 12 declared personal interests but one analyst has argued that if recent interests were included, the number would rise to 11 of 12 who \"either works, or worked, for a food, farming or catering company, or own shares in such companies, or is an adviser to the industry or has a close relative working in it\". 6 In March, 2008, after new members had been appointed, the balance altered. Although seven of 14 declared current interests, if previous commercial and industry interests were included, nine would be seen as having present or recent commercial interests. 19 Although the Code of Conduct safeguards the participation of Board members in the discussion of matters in which they have a potential interest, in view of the preponderance of Board members with industry interests and the Code's failure to deal clearly with recent and previous interests, the undertakings provided by ministers on the independence of the FSA Board have not been consistently or fully implemented. That implementation defi cit is unacceptable.",

One element of this policy will be global health, a subject often characterised by controversy. The debate that will shape the next administration's approach to global health has begun, including the decision by the US Institute of Medicine to update its 1997 report on US global-health priorities. 1 What principles might inform this debate? Policy makers often reason by metaphors to boil down a set of complex policy tradeoff s into a few consistent strategies and principles. 2 We suggest that there are at least fi ve metaphors that can be applied to global health (table) . These are global health as foreign policy, 3,4 global health as security, 5 global health as charity, 6 global health as investment, 7 and global health as public health. 8 The policies that will be pursued crucially depend on which metaphor is dominant.",

Ideally, these discussions would be informed by the metaphor of global health as public health, so that priorities would move closer to the actual, rather than the commonly perceived, contributors to the burden of disease, with a greater emphasis on non-communicable diseases and mental illness. Yet, unless these discussions take account of the other metaphors, which are likely to dominate the defi nition of broader US foreign policy, any proposals risk being marginalised. The Institute of Medicine's 1997 report 1 identifi ed the key issues as \"global health as security\" and \"global health as foreign policy\". Now the challenge is to build a coalition that embraces the principal metaphors being used, explicitly aligning the pursuit of public health with foreign policy, security, charity, and investment and, when contradictions emerge, exposing and dealing with them. The UK's new global-health strategy, which does just this, might be a good place to start. 12 ",

A paan might be off ered as a delicacy after food because it gives a pleasant oral sensation; the oral mucosa and lips being tinted red by the ingredients. Paan is believed by many to be an aphrodisiac, which thus further heightens its attractiveness, particularly to young men. Its use is, however, far from benign, as shown by a study among Gujaratis in northwest London, which found that paan chewers had cocaine-like dependency with withdrawal symptoms of headaches and sweating. 4 The sight of queues outside paan shops in the morning is thus perhaps not surprising.
