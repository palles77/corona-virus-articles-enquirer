Lung macrophages are highly plastic and heterogeneous cells that are resident in the lung interstitium and alveoli or recruited upon inflammatory stimuli. Inflammatory monocytes and resident tissue macrophages play critical roles in initiating and maintaining inflammation Newly emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome CoVs (MERS-CoV), and H7N9, cause fatal acute lung injury (ALI) by driving hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation through mechanisms that remain elusive. In SARS-CoV/macaque models, we determined that anti-spike IgG (S-IgG), in productively infected lungs, causes severe ALI by skewing inflammation-resolving response. Alveolar macrophages underwent functional polarization in acutely infected macaques, demonstrating simultaneously both proinflammatory and wound-healing characteristics. The presence of S-IgG prior to viral clearance, however, abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted MCP1 and IL-8 production and proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment and accumulation. Critically, patients who eventually died of SARS (hereafter referred to as deceased patients) displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary proinflammatory, absence of wound-healing macrophages, and faster neutralizing antibody responses. Their sera enhanced SARS-CoV-induced MCP1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of Fc\u03b3R reduced such effects. Our findings reveal a mechanism responsible for virus-mediated ALI, define a pathological consequence of viral specific antibody response, and provide a potential target for treatment of SARS-CoV or other virus-mediated lung injury.",

            "text": "during the acute stage of ARDS, as well as in the resolution phages of inflammation and recovery from ARDS. At steady state, resident macrophages are normally quiescent to prevent damaging the alveoli and are critically involved in normal tissue homeostasis. After tissue injury or during infection, resident macrophages become activated. Circulating monocytes can be efficiently recruited to the site of injury. Inflammatory monocytes/macrophages (IMMs) and resident macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes, and they can be classified into proinflammatory (M1 or classically activated) and inflammatory-resolving (M2, alternatively activated, wound-healing, or antiinflammatory) macrophages, with a continuum of macrophage polarization existing beyond these discrete categories (9) . During acute infection, monocytes/macrophages often display a phenotype of classically activated macrophages. These cells mediate host defenses against viruses and also promote lung injury by producing nitric oxide (NO); ROS; IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8; and TNF. Simultaneously, some macrophages may become alternatively activated, exerting antiinflammatory function and regulating wound healing by producing matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), growth factors, and antiinflammatory cytokines, particularly TGF-\u03b2. When the pathogen or inflammatory stimulus is eliminated, proinflammatory macrophages diminish. The predominant macrophage population assumes a wound-healing phenotype. At the final recovery stage, macrophages show a regulatory/suppressive phenotype, secreting increased levels of IL-10, which facilitates the resolution of wound healing and restores homeostasis. When the wound-healing response is well organized and controlled, the inflammatory response resolves quickly, and normal tissue architecture is restored. Disturbances in wound-healing response can lead to uncontrolled production of inflammatory mediators, contributing to a state of persistent injury (9) (10) (11) . In patients who eventually died of SARS (hereafter referred to as deceased patients) and animal models, extensive lung damage is associated with high initial viral loads, increased IMM accumulation in the lungs, and elevated serum proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-10, and MCP1) levels (4, 5, 12, 13) . While much is known about the terminal phase of SARS, little is known about the early immune events during the acute phase of infection. Studies defining macrophage heterogeneity and function during acute infection and ALI using nonhuman primate and patient specimens are limited, and the factors driving the hypercytokinemia and aggressive inflammation remain elusive.",

            "text": "During the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, most patients (70%-80%) presented with abnormal chest radiographs, with approximately one-quarter of these individuals progressing to ALI. After 12 days, 80% of these SARS patients developed ARDS, coincident with IgG seroconversion (6) . In a detailed analysis of antibody responses against SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein, we reported that the anti-S neutralizing antibody (NAb) response developed significantly faster in deceased patients compared with recovered patients after the onset of clinical symptoms (14) . It took an average of 20 days for the recovered patients to reach their peak of NAb activities, as opposed to only 14.7 days for the deceased patients. Moreover, the actual NAb titer is significantly higher in deceased patients compared with that in the recovered patients during the same time period (14) . These findings suggest a role of anti-S antibodies in SARS-CoV-mediated ALI during acute infection. Consistently, preexisting serum antibodies against influenza antigens were found to associate with worse clinical severity and poor outcomes in patients during the 2009 influenza pandemic (15, 16) . Moreover, multiple vaccine platforms and viral infection appeared to induce SARS-CoV-specific immune memory that enhanced lung inflammation following homologous challenge in mice and African green monkeys (17) (18) (19) . The mechanism responsible for the immunopathologic reaction remains elusive. Recent studies suggested that T cells play a crucial role in protection of mice against lethal SARS-CoV infection (20) (21) (22) . Enhanced pulmonary immunopathology in vaccinated and challenged animals reflects an inadequate Th1 response (22, 23) . The role of virus-specific antibody response in SARS-CoV-induced lung injury has yet to be clearly defined. Therefore, we used vaccination and anti-S-IgG passive immunization strategies to evaluate the effects of anti-S antibodies on SARS-CoV-induced ALI in Chinese rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Our results now show that, in productively infected lungs, anti-S-IgG causes severe ALI by skewing inflammatory resolving responses during acute infection.",

Two macaques showed moderate inflammation with more interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration and were scored as ++ (CL26, CE24; Supplemental Figure 1C and Supplemental Figure 2 ). Only 1 macaque showed typical symptoms of acute DAD with extensive exudation and cell infiltration at 35 dpi (CL22, scored as ++++; Supplemental Figure 2 ).

One macaque showed severe acute DAD with exudation, hyaline membrane formation along the alveoli, pneumocyte desquamation, and damaged alveolus filled with hemorrhage and inflammatory cells (SL15, scored as +++++; Figure 1D ). One macaque showed early symptom of acute DAD (SL14, scored as +++; Supplemental Figure 1D ), and the remaining 2 macaques showed moderate inflammation (SE13 and SE17, scored as ++; Supplemental Figure 2 ). The comparison of lung histopathlogical scores of 2 groups showed significantly enhanced lung injury in the ADS-MVA-vaccinated group at both 7 and 35 dpi compared with the control ADC-MVA group, suggesting that S-specific -but not MVA-specific -immunity promotes ALI during SARS-CoV infection ( Figure 1E ). Moreover, there is a moderate correlation between lung pathological scores and sera NAb titers at 0 dpi ( Figure 1F ), suggesting a role of S-specific antibody in enhancing SARS-CoV-mediated lung injury.",

In our previous study, i.n. inoculation of Chinese macaques with SARS-CoV PUMC (1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 ) led to lower respiratory tract infection in all animals within 2 days (25) . However, most of them rapidly cleared infection in the lungs, and all of the animals (n = 8) exhibited mild lung lesions before 3 dpi (25) . Severe lung injury in SARS-CoV-infected Chinese macaques has not been detected until 7 dpi (26, 27) . To determine the effect of anti-S antibody on the extent of SARS-CoV-mediated lung injury, we adoptively transferred 5 mg (low dose) and 200 mg (high dose) purified anti-S-IgG from ADS-MVA-vaccinated but unchallenged macaques into 2 groups of unvaccinated macaques (n = 6/group) via i.v. injection, and then i.n. challenged recipients with SARS-CoV PUMC (1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 ) ( Figure 2A ). As controls, another 2 macaques were administered 200 mg of control IgG (C-IgG) derived from ADC-MVA-vaccinated macaques. We sacrificed half of the macaques in each group at 2 dpi to avoid potential disruption by virus infection-induced antibodies against nucleocapsid protein (N) and other viral proteins -and prior to when induction of ALI was typically observed. The remaining half of the macaques in each group was sacrificed at 21 dpi to evaluate long-term impact (Figure 2A ). At day 2, sera from macaques that received low-or high-dose S-IgG showed neutralizing activity, with IC 50 values ranging from 10-260 and 1,000-10,000, corresponding to the dose of sera transfer; macaques that received C-IgG failed to show neutralizing activity ( Figure 2B and Supplemental Table 1 ). While NAb titers in the sera of macaques in the high-dose group declined steadily between 2 and 21 dpi, macaques in the low-dose and control groups displayed increased NAb titers over time ( Figure 2B ), suggesting active viral replication.",

Therefore, we measured viral RNA + cells by in situ hybridization (ISH), as well as NP signals in the lungs and the hilar LNs by IHC staining to evaluate the actual pulmonary infection of each macaque. Consistent with the results by viral isolation (Supplemental Table 1 ), viral RNA was detected in pneumocytes of 1 macaque in the high-dose (HS02, 33%), 2 macaques in the low-dose (LS01, LS02; 66%), and the C-IgG-treated macaque ( Figure 3A and Supplemental Table 3 ), suggesting reduced productive infection by S-IgG. However, an NP antibody identified positive signals in the lungs and hilar LNs of all S-IgG and C-IgG recipients (7 of 7 macaques) but not healthy controls ( Figure 3B and Supplemental Table 3 ), suggesting that S-IgG failed to prevent SARS-CoV entry, and SARS-CoV established lower respiratory tract infection in all of the challenged animals.",

MAC387 + and CD163 + monocytes/macrophages not only gathered around NP + cells, but also formed clusters in tissues with little NP signal ( Figure 3C ), suggesting that infection-induced recruitment from circulation continued after viral clearance and accumulated at the inflamed site. Moreover, more-concentrated CD68 + signals were found, indicating altered macrophages functional response by S-IgG treatment ( Figure 3C ). Consistently, elevated serum levels of IL-8 were observed in macaques treated with high-dose S-IgG at 2 dpi (Supplemental Figure 3 ), and the IL-8 levels are strongly correlated with anti-SARS-CoV NAb titers (Supplemental Figure 3 ). IL-8 is a macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokine important in initiating ALI. These results, therefore, suggest that S-IgG likely altered macrophage functional response in the lungs during acute infection, resulted in increase in IL-8 production, and enhanced ALI and IMM infiltration and accumulation.",

A well-organized wound-healing response leads to timely resolution of inflammation, whereas disturbance in wound-healing response results in persistent inflammation and injury. To understand the S-IgG-caused excessive inflammation, we further defined macrophage heterogeneity and activation statues in the lung lesions of C-IgG (n = 1) and S-IgG recipients (n = 3) at 2 dpi.

They are interstitial macrophages (IMs; MAC387 + HAM56 -CD206 -) ( Figure 4A ) and resident alveolar macrophages (AMs; CD68 + HAM56 -) expressing low levels of CD163 and CD206, a marker specific to the macrophage wound-healing response, corresponding to their intrinsic antiinflammatory function ( Figure 4B ) (29) . In lung lesions of both C-IgG-treated and naive macaque groups challenged with SARS-CoV PUMC , IMMs were further characterized and divided into 2 subpopulations. One subpopulation was the recently recruited MAC387 + HAM56 -CD68monocytes ( Figure 4C ) (29) , which is like IM but is larger in size and primarily coexpressed CD163 (Supplemental Figure 4) . The other subpopulation was single CD163 + inflammatory macrophages that had differentiated from newly recruited MAC387 + monocytes/macrophages ( Figure 4D and Supplemental Figure 4 ) (29) . Importantly, resident AMs (CD68 + ) differentiated into HAM56 + cells, with a slight increase in numbers and increased size, with stronger CD163 and -more importantly -CD206 staining, suggesting that they are alternatively activated ( Figure 4D ). Strikingly, elevated levels of TGF-\u03b2 expression were detected in all MAC387 + -and most enlarged CD163 + -as well as CD68 + macrophages in the lungs of both C-IgG-treated and unvaccinated macaques compared with healthy controls (Figure 4 , G-I), indicating that many IMMs and activated resident AMs have assumed a wound-healing function in infected lungs within 2 days of infection.",

Compared with the macaques not treated with S-IgG, the number of IMMs (MAC387 + and CD163 + HAM56 -) significantly increased in S-IgG recipients (Figure 4 , E and F). Moreover, many recently recruited MAC387 + HAM56monocytes/macrophages did not coexpress CD163 (Supplemental Figure 4) , representing the newest recruited blood monocytes, as a result of enhanced monocytes infiltration by S-IgG. Importantly, the majority of CD163 + HAM56 -IMMs coexpressed CD68 (Supplemental Figure 4) , suggesting a change of function of this subpopulation by S-IgG. Moreover, resident macrophages (CD68 + HAM56 + ) in the lungs of S-IgG recipients no longer express CD206, which -being surrounded by many CD163 + IMMs ( Figure 4F ) -suggests a loss of wound-healing function and a role in recruiting blood monocytes. Consistently, S-IgG-treated macaques displayed a loss of TGF-\u03b2 and high expression of IL-6 in all macrophage subpopulations ( Figure 4 , G, H, and J). IL-6 favors macrophage accumulation at the site of injury and is important for the development of persistent inflammation and ALI (31, 32) . Therefore, we conclude that, while AMs underwent phenotypic and functional changes in acutely infected lungs, many monocytes/macrophages assumed a wound-healing function for inflammation resolution, but the presence of S-IgG skewed the wound-healing response, leading to uncontrolled inflammation and tissue injury.",

To determine whether S-IgG skews wound-healing response through modifying wound-healing macrophage functional response during SARS-CoV infection, we treated in vitro-polarized alternatively activated human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) for 20 hours with SARS-CoV pseudovirus and heat-inactivated sera of high-dose S-IgG-treated macaques (S-IgG sera) collected at 2 dpi. We then measured the concentrations of 13 inflammatory cytokines in cell culture supernatants, including IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, MCP1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-33. Sera from C-IgG recipients or healthy macaques were included as controls. In vitro-polarized classically activated MDM was also studied and compared with alternatively activated MDM in parallel. Consistent with previous report, unstimulated classically activated MDM produced high levels of IL-8 and IL-6; alternatively activated MDM only produced minimal levels of those cytokines ( Figure 6A ). Addition of SARS-CoV pseudovirus induced IL-8 production in alternatively activated MDM to levels comparable with those found in unstimulated, classically activated MDM, as well as in low-level MCP1 and IL-6 production ( Figure 6B ). By contrast, SARS-CoV pseudovirus caused less than a 1-fold increase in IL-8 secretion, but not other cytokine secretion, by classically activated MDM ( Figure 6C ). Strikingly, while none of the sera samples induced cytokine production when they were administered into MDMs alone, panel in B, D, and F) . A and B show 2 subpopulations at steady states, including interstitial macrophages (IM) (MAC387 + HAM56 -CD206 -) (yellow arrow), and resident alveolar macrophages (AM) (CD68 + CD163 lo CD206 lo HAM56 -) (white arrows). C and D show the presence of alternatively activated resident AM and accumulated IMMs in the C-IgG group. Alternatively activated AMs are CD206 hi CD68 + CD163 hi HAM56 + (D, white arrows). IM are MAC387 + HAM56 -CD206 -(C, yellow arrow). IMMs include newly infiltrating monocytes/ macrophages (MAC387 + ) (C, green arrow); and inflammatory macrophages (CD163 + CD68 -CD206 -HAM56 -) (D, green arrow). E and F show significantly increased number of IMMs and decreased number of alternatively activated macrophages in the S-IgG group. IMMs include newly infiltrating monocytes/macrophages (MAC387 + ) (E, green arrow) and inflammatory macrophages that are CD68 + HAM56 -(green arrow, F, upper panel) and CD163 + CD206 -HAM56 -(green arrow, F, lower panel). Resident AMs are no longer expressing CD206 (CD68 + HAM56 + CD163 + CD206 -) (blue arrow, F, upper panel). (G-J) TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 expression in macrophages in the lungs. These sections were double-immunostained with antibodies for TGF-\u03b2 or IL-6 (TRITC) and MAC387, CD163, or CD68 (FITC). G shows low expression levels of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 in IMs (MAC387 + ) and AMs (CD68 + ) in healthy macaques. H shows increased TGF-\u03b2 expression in the C-IgG group (white arrows) but increased IL-6 in the S-IgG group (blue arrows). I and J show the numbers of TGF-\u03b2 + and IL-6 + monocytes/macrophages in 3 groups in a 200\u00d7 field. administration of S-IgG sera caused a dose-dependent increase in the production of all 3 inflammatory cytokines in SARS-CoV-stimulated alternatively activated MDM, resulted in a greater than 10-fold increase in IL-6, an 8-fold increase in MCP1, and a 5-fold increase in IL-8 ( Figure 6 , D and E). This enhancement, however, was not observed when S-IgG sera were replaced with sera from C-IgG recipients or healthy macaques (Figure 6 , F, G, and H), suggesting that S-IgG, but not other sera components, enhanced SARS-CoV-stimulated cytokine production by alternatively activated MDM. Administration of S-IgG sera had no effect on cytokine production by SARS-CoV-treated classically activated MDM ( Figure 6 , I, J, and K), indicating that S-IgG do not modulate virus-mediated classically activated macrophage functional response. MCP1 and IL-8 are key cytokines that regulate monocytes/macrophages migration and promote neutrophils infiltration, while IL-6 promotes persistent inflammation and injury. These results suggest that, in response to SARS-CoV infection, wound-healing macrophages produce IL-8 and low amounts of MCP1 to recruit neutrophils and blood monocytes, whereas the presence . Viral RNA + (TRITC) type I pneumocytes (FITC) was found at 2 dpi (n = 2) and 7 dpi (n = 1). (C) Viral RNA in the swabs and lung homogenates on 7 dpi. SARS-CoV RNA was detected using nested RT-PCR in swabs from 3 macaques (AD0516, AD0517, and AD0518) and lung homogenates from macaque AD0516. (D) Viral antigen and inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs at 7 dpi (200\u00d7). These sections were stained for SARS-CoV NP (red) and nucleus (blue) by IHC, showing NP signal in macrophage-like cells in AD0516 and AD0517 (red arrows), and type I pneumocytes in AD0518 (blue arrows), but substantial inflammatory infiltrates were only observed in AD0516 (green arrows). (E) Serum neutralizing activity. Serum neutralizing activity was detected in macaques AD0515 and AD0516 at 7 dpi. (F-I) Decreased wound-healing response in macaques with productive pulmonary viral infection and serum neutralizing activity (200\u00d7). These sections were double-immunostained for TGF-\u03b2 (TRITC) and CD163 (FITC) or triple stained for CD206 (cyan), HAM56 (FITC), and CD163 (TRITC). The figure shows that wound-healing response took place within 2 dpi, with alternatively activated monocytes/macrophages (TGF-\u03b2 + and CD206 + , white arrows) and IMMs (CD163 + CD206 -, green arrows) coexisting in the lungs (F). After viral clearance, IMMs diminish at 3 dpi (G), and the homeostasis was restored at 7 dpi (AD0515) (H). When pulmonary viral infection persists, IMM (CD163 + CD206 -, green arrows) infiltration and accumulation is enhanced, and wound-healing macrophages (CD206 + ) are reduced in macaques that have faster NAb response (AD0516) (I).",

To examine whether human anti-SARS-CoV antibody modifies wound-healing response during SARS-CoV infection, we treated in vitro-polarized alternatively activated MDM with SARS-CoV pseudovirus for 20 hours in the presence of sera collected from SARS patients during acute infection. Macrophages treated with SARS-CoV pseudovirus or sera alone were included as controls. We then examined the protein levels of cytokines/chemokines in the cell culture supernatant. Consistent with findings in macaques, administration of sera from a deceased SARS patient (D1; Supplemental Table 5 ) into SARS-CoV-treated alternatively activated MDM caused a dose-dependent increase in the production of cytokines, leading to a 2-to 3-fold increase in MCP1 and IL-8 after 20 hours (Figure 8, A and B ). This enhancement, however, was not observed in cells treated with sera alone (Figure 8, A-D) . Administration of sera from recovered patients (n = 8; Supplemental Table 5 ) had no effect on cytokine production except 1 sample (Figure 8, C and D) . These differences may be explained, at least in part, by their lower NAb titers, although it is also possible that sera from recovered patients contain different antibody populations. Consistently, the only serum sample -R2, which enhanced chemokine production -has a relatively higher NAb titer among the samples tested (Supplemental Table 5 ). Moreover, statistical analysis shows that IL-8 production strongly correlates with NAb titer of sera from deceased patients ( Figure 8E ). Furthermore, IL-8 production was significantly reduced when cells were treated with SARS-CoV pseudovirus and sera from deceased SARS patient (diluted 1:4,000) in the presence of Fc\u03b3R blocking antibody, indicating that anti-SARS-CoV antibody modifies wound-healing response in humans partially through Fc\u03b3Rs ( Figure 8F ).",

Respiratory CoVs infection poses a unique challenge to the immune system: not only must the virus be rapidly eliminated, but lung inflammation must also be controlled to prevent acute respiratory failure (33) . In the present study, we show that, despite markedly reducing virus titers, anti-S-IgG caused lung injury during the early stages of infection by abrogating a wound-healing macrophage response and TGF-\u03b2 production, while promoting proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 and MCP1 production and inflammatory macrophage accumulation. To our knowledge, our data demonstrate a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying virus-mediated ALI and suggest that modulation of the anti-S antibody response or blockage of Fc\u03b3 receptors during acute infection might be needed for effective treatment for respiratory CoV infection.",

However, the effect of S-specific immunity in protecting against pulmonary immunopathology has been controversial. In some cases, vaccination-induced immunity assists the viral clearance and protects mice or ferrets against lethal challenge (36) (37) (38) (39) , whereas in many other situations, multiple vaccine platforms appear to induce increased eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary response upon challenge (18, 23, 40) . These differences may be explained, in part, by the characteristics of the vaccine being studied, the infectious dose, and the viral strain employed, as well as by the type or quality of immune response elicited. Recent studies suggest that CD8 + T cell response plays a crucial role in viral clearance and protection of mice against eosinophilic immunopathology and lethal SARS-CoV infection, whereas immunopathology predominantly reflects an inadequate vaccine-induced Th1 response (20) (21) (22) (23) .",

Although several vaccine candidates protected macaques against viral replication in the lungs, pulmonary immunopathology was not evaluated in these studies (24, 41, 42) . By contrast, it was shown that SARS-CoV-specific immune memory induced by prior infection enhanced lung inflammation following homologous challenge in African green monkeys (17) . Similarly, augmentation of disease by vaccination has also been described in studies of atypical measles and dengue hemorrhagic fever, as well as several respiratory diseases, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pandemic influenza (16, 43) . In the study of RSV vaccine conducted in 1966 and 1967, 80% of RSV vaccinees needed hospitalization, whereas only 5% of RSV-infected children in the control vaccine group required admission, although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Using Chinese rhesus macaques, we show that an ADS-MVA-based vaccine protected macaques against viral replication but significantly enhanced acute DAD at both 7 and 35 dpi compared with the control ADC-MVA group, suggesting that S-specific but not MVA-specific immunity promotes ALI (Figure 1 ). Until now, it remains unknown if SARS vaccine candidates with a focus on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein can avoid the induction of ALI in nonhuman primates. These vaccines have been shown to induce highly potent NAb responses and elicit long-term protective immunity in immunized small animals (38) .",

Our data suggest that these effects, in part, reflect the rapid control of viral replication in the lungs, which peaked between 24 and 48 hours after inoculation (hpi) and diminished within 7 days, thus creating an interval between lung inflammation and high titer antibody production in most macaques. Indeed, although SARS-CoV infection resulted in significant infiltration of macrophages in the lungs, the number of macrophages was rapidly reduced following virus clearance at 3 dpi ( Figure 5 ). At 7 dpi, inflammation appeared to be mostly resolved ( Figure 5 ). By contrast, control of virus replication is less efficient in SARS patients, and the peak in viral load coincides with the first appearance of an antibody response, approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms (6) .",

Using vaccination and passive immunization, we conditioned anti-S antibody titers in macaques during the early stage of infection when ALI was not typically observed. We found that prior administration of anti-S-IgG led to massive accumulation of monocytes/macrophages in the lungs within 2 dpi. This result is consistent with previous reports, in which mice given the SARS vaccine exhibited an immunopathologic lung reaction after the subsequent challenge with SARS-CoV (18, 19) . Moreover, in SARS patients, clinical course and outcome are more favorable in children younger than 12 years of age compared with adolescents and adults (44) , indicating that prior alternative CoV infection might play a role in driving enhanced pulmonary inflammation. A recent study reported that pathogenic immune complexes promoted lung injury during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (16) .

By contrast, abrogated wound healing by S-IgG resulted in decreased TGF-\u03b2 production and prolonged classical macrophage activation, and it promoted severe lung injury. Our findings are primarily based on imaging of formalin-fixed tissues of infected macaques, which may have technical limitations. A detailed flow cytometric analysis would be helpful to further characterize macrophage subpopulations in infected lungs. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to obtain any live cells, including macrophages, for analysis by flow cytometry outside the BSL-3 laboratory in China, which is in line with \"WHO biosafety guidelines for handling of SARS specimens\" (https://www.who.int/csr/sars/biosafety2003_04_25/en/). Having said this, TGF-\u03b2 is mainly derived from wound-healing macrophages but not from classically activated macrophages. Therefore, by staining both TGF-\u03b2 and CD206 (another biomarker of wound-healing macrophages), we believe that the finding of reduction of this type of macrophages in the S-IgG-treated lungs is convincing.",

These results might reflect a different quality of antibodies in recovered patients from deceased patients during early infection. Indeed, we previously observed that deceased patients had significantly higher NAbs with a very low level of anti-N antibodies in serum during the early stage of infection (14) . In contrast, recovered patients had more rapid anti-N antibody and slower NAb development (14) . Consistently, serum from deceased patients -but not SARS survivors during early stages of infection -enhanced IL-6, IL-8, and MCP1 production by wound-healing macrophages (Figure 8) . We previously identified epitopes in S protein that elicited NAbs and antibodies that enhanced SARS-CoV infection (48, 49) . Further studies that will attempt to identify antibodies and epitopes that mediate prevention or enhancement of ALI might be needed for future vaccine design and immunotherapy.",

Fc\u03b3Rs are functionally divided into activating and inhibitory receptors. Activating Fc\u03b3Rs, such as Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RIIA, and Fc\u03b3RIII, triggers production of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in their intracytoplasmic domain and SRC family kinases and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), whereas the inhibitory Fc\u03b3R, Fc\u03b3RIIB, has an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhi bition motif (ITIM) in its intracytoplasmic domain and counteracts the signals that are mediated by activating Fc\u03b3Rs. Based on literature and our experiments, human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages express higher levels of CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIII) and CD32A (Fc\u03b3RIIA) (50) . Therefore, it is likely that S-IgG promoted proinflammatory cytokine production through Fc\u03b3RI and/or Fc\u03b3RIIA. S-IgG did not affect classically activated macrophage function in vitro. This difference can be possibly explained by the high baseline level of proinflammatory cytokines before infection and the downregulated expression of Fc\u03b3R on classically activated MDM by SARS-CoV treatment.",

ZC is the principal investigator, with overall responsibility for the design of the study. QW and CQ coordinated the autopsy organization and collection of autopsy materials of Chinese macaques. QW was involved in the development and performance of the RT-PCR assay. LL, HT, TW, and KWC performed the neutralization assay. LL, XA, and AL were involved in the development of the H&E, SARS-CoV IHC, and ISH assays. HW performed the ISH assay and the IHC staining of NP and calculation of the mean florescence intensity in the lungs. LL, HK, and KN performed the H&E and double-or triple-IHC staining. JF and HT performed culture of monocyte-derived macrophages. QL, HT, JP, and ZT performed analysis of cytokine production in cell culture supernatant and monkey sera. KHC and KYY coordinated the collection of sera and tissue sample from SARS patients. All authors were involved in the correlative interpretation of the pathological and molecular data.",

(A) Experimental design used to investigate the influence of S-specific immunity on SARS-CoV-induced lung injury. Two groups of Chinese rhesus macaques (n = 8/group) were subjected to i.m. injections of ADS-MVA or control vaccine ADC-MVA at weeks 0 and 4, followed by i.n. challenge with live pathogenic SARS-CoV PUMC (1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 ) at 4 weeks after the second vaccination. Four animals each were sacrificed at 1 and 5 weeks after inoculation. Three healthy macaques were included as controls. (B) Serum neutralizing activity. Sera collected from macaques were tested for a capacity to neutralize SARS-CoV pseudotype virus. (C) Detection of viral RNA in oral swabs. SARS-CoV RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR in the swabs at the indicated time points relative to infection. (D) Pathology changes of the lung tissue. Sections were stained with H&E. D shows symptom of acute DAD exhibited in 6 of 8 ADS-MVAvaccinated macaques with extensive exudation (yellow arrow), hyaline membranes lining the alveolar walls (black arrows), and massive cell infiltration in alveolar cavities (white arrow). Left image shows a low magnification overview (100\u00d7). Middle image shows higher magnification of the boxed area in left image (200\u00d7). Right image shows minor inflammation observed in 7 macaques received ADC-MVA (n = 8) with slight alveolar septa broadening and sparse monocyte infiltration (original magnification, 100\u00d7). (E) Histopathological scores of the ADS-MVA group, including lung samples collected at both 7 and 35 dpi, were compared against the ADC-MVA control group. See Supplemental",
