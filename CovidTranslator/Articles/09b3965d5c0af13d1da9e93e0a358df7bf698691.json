This study evaluated 222 diarrhoeic faecal samples from four Brazilian geographical regions (South, Southeast, Midwest, and North), collected between February 2010 to May 2012. To evaluate the frequency of occurrence in different types of livestock, samples from beef (n=105) and dairy (n=117) cattle herds were evaluated. To determine the category of animals more susceptible to infection, the sampling included samples from calves (n= 182) and adults animals (n=40). The 216 bp fragment of the Aichivirus RdRp gene was amplified by a RT-PCR assay in 18.2 % (40/222) of the samples evaluated in both beef and dairy cattle animals. The highest (P<0.05) detection rate (20.9 %; 38/182) of the Aichivirus B was found in calves. The nucleotide sequencing analysis showed that the Brazilian Aichivirus B strains clustered in a distinct branch in the phylogenetic tree of the European and Asiatic strains. This is the first description of Aichivirus B infection in Brazilian cattle herds.",

The Parana State demonstrated the highest rate of virus detection, with 50 % of herds testing positive, which shows that Aichivirus B infection in cattle is widespread among herds in this state. Comparing the two types of livestock production, the highest (22.2 %; 26/ 117) detection rate of Aichivirus B positive diarrhoeic faecal samples was found in dairy herds, while in beef cattle herds the virus was found in 13.3 % (14/105) of the evaluated samples. However, there was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05) between the presence of infection in dairy and beef herds. Aichivirus B has been detected in Japan (Yamashita et al. 2003) , Thailand (Khamrin et al. 2008) , Belgium (Mauroy et al. 2009 (Barry et al. 2011) , respectively. In this study Aichivirus B was detected in 20.9 % (38/182) of the faecal samples from calves \u226460 days of age, while studies performed in South Korea found the Aichivirus B in 40.9 % and 66.7 % of samples from calves Park et al. 2011) . The high prevalence of infection in young animals can be explained by the fact that this virus belongs to the group of agents responsible for neonatal disease, which has also been observed in pigs, and the highest positive rate for Aichivirus C is found in piglets (Park et al. 2010; Ribeiro et al. 2013; Verma et al. 2013) .",
