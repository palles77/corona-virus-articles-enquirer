MxA belongs to the family of Mx proteins which are among the few effector proteins of the IFN a/b system with known antiviral activity. The Mx proteins are abundantly expressed in interferon-treated cells and play a crucial role in the early antiviral defense against certain RNA viruses which has been demonstrated in studies with transgenic mice also (Arnheiter et al., 1990; Hefti et al., 1999; Pavlovic et al., 1995) . Human MxA is shown to inhibit multiplication of several ssRNA and dsRNA viruses including influenza, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Pavlovic et al., 1990) , measles virus (Schnorr et al., 1993) , Thogoto virus , Bunyavirus (Frese et al., 1996) , and Semliki forest virus (Landis et al., 1998) . MxA has also been shown to confer resistance to some DNA viral genomes (Gordien et al., 2001) (Netherton et al., 2009) . In general, MxA appears to interfere with steps involving viral transcription although the exact mechanism of action is not known or fully understood.",

These proteins present a highly conserved N-terminal GTPase domain of ~300 amino acids, a central interactive domain of ~150 amino acids, and a GTPase effector domain (GED) of ~100 amino acids which encompasses two leucine zippers that have the capacity to form \u03b1-helices. The MxA GTPase domain has a low affinity for GTP but high GTP turnover rate which is indicative of efficient cycling achieved only within dense protein complexes typically assembled on the membrane surface (Goryachev and Pokhilko, 2006; Melen et al., 1994; Richter et al., 1995) . Studies with human MxA protein have shown that the GED effector domain is able to specifically contact the middle domain, and that this interaction is critical to constitute a functional GTPase domain, as well as for oligomerization (Gao et al., 2010; Haller and Kochs, 2011) and antiviral functions Schumacher and Staeheli, 1998) .",

It has previously been reported that a SNP at nucleotide position \u221288 (G or T) in the promoter region of the gene modulates MxA function at multiple levels including expression. MxA mRNA is significantly up-regulated with the mutant \"T\" (TT or GT) allele as compared to the wild type homozygous \"G\" allele (Fernandez-Arcas et al., 2004; Furuyama et al., 2006; Hijikata et al., 2001) . This functional polymorphic marker (rs2071430) is well studied and demonstrates an association with various diseases such as susceptibility to hepatitis C virus (Hijikata et al., 2000) , SARS (Hamano et al., 2005) , and sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis (Torisu et al., 2004) . Interestingly, an interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) is located around the single nucleotide polymorphism (rs2071430) in the promoter region and can also influence MX1 promoter activity. The T allele restores and the G allele attenuates ISRE binding due to sequence homology (Hijikata et al., 2000; Nakade et al., 1997) . Functional promoter studies using MxA luciferase reporter assay has also demonstrated that promoter activity is highest in individuals with TT genotype and lowest in the GG genotype (Hijikata et al., 2001; Torisu et al., 2004) .",

The OAS1 and prostate cancer association study prompted to ask the question whether polymorphisms in other classical IFN inducible anti-viral genes such as MxA are also common risk factors in prostate cancer. For this study we selected a single functional polymorphic marker at position \u221288 (rs2071430) in the promoter of MxA gene. In general the rs2071430 GG genotype promotes disease susceptibility whereas TT genotype confers protection towards Hepatitis C and B virus infection (Hijikata et al., 2001) . At the mechanistic level, the functional rs2071430 GG, GT and TT genotype results in the lowest, intermediate and highest MX1 enzyme activity respectively (Fernandez-Arcas et al., 2004; Noguchi et al., 2012) . In in vitro luciferase based reporter assays and in PBMC the allele TT/GT at \u221288 demonstrated higher reporter activity and MxA expression in response to IFN-alpha than GG allele suggesting a functional ISRE around rs2071430 (Fernandez-Arcas et al., 2004) . Consistent with these observations, the rs2071430 genotype has been proposed to predict responsiveness to IFNalpha therapy and susceptibility of Multiple sclerosis and Hepatitis C and B.",

Our results suggest that the low activity GG genotype is a risk factor for prostate cancer whereas higher activity genotype TT protects against prostate cancer in general. These results are significant and suggest that low MxA expression due to GG genotype could be associated with prostate cancer especially in context of a functional study which demonstrated that MxA acts as tumor suppressor. MxA inhibits the motility and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells suggesting that its attenuated expression may promote aggressiveness of the disease (Mushinski et al., 2009) . The GTPase activity of MxA appeared necessary and sufficient for blocking prostate cancer cell (PC3) invasiveness.",

Our present findings are clinically very useful for future studies to determine whether the \u221288G>T SNP may influence clinical outcome or is a genetic factor for increased risk or aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the association of two interferon inducible antiviral genes OAS1 (ref) and MxA, as shown in this study strongly suggests the possible viral etiology of prostate cancer. A larger study addressing the association between rs2071430 polymorphism and MxA expression in the prostate would be required to firmly establish whether MxA genotype is associated with altered expression. Alternatively, MxA rs2071430 genotype could lead to increased risk of prostate cancer due to complex gene-gene and/or geneenvironment, (such increased susceptibility to infections) interactions.",
