Methods A total of 3,527 Hong Kong Chinese adults were interviewed by telephone within the framework of six identical cross-sectional surveys carried out during the 28-month study period. Given a hypothetical scenario that two to three new human-to-human H5N1 cases had been reported in Hong Kong, the trends of the respondents in various H5N1-related risk perceptions, anticipated personal psychological responses, and anticipated personal preventive behaviors were investigated. Results Over time, a decreased proportion of the respondents (1) felt susceptible to contracting H5N1, (2) expected a large outbreak would eventually occur, (3) believed that the impacts of H5N1 were worse than those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and (4) anticipated adopting more types of preventive measures and experiencing mental distress in the case of a smallscale outbreak in Hong Kong (AOR from 0.27 to 0.43, p \\ 0.001), but the public remained vigilant on public health behaviors, such as hand-washing. The prevalence of misconceptions on the mode of transmission declined, but remained high; perceptions on the fatality of H5N1 remained largely underestimated. The SARS experience and unconfirmed beliefs about the transmission modes were associated with variables on anticipated preventive behaviors and emotional distress. Conclusion Starting in 2005 through to 2008, respondents perceived a decreasing level of susceptibility, severity, and anticipated stress towards a hypothetical human-to-human H5N1 outbreak, possibly due to the low efficiency of transmission. The public's general preparedness was still relatively good and rational, even though individual preventive behaviors were less common. However, misconceptions were prevalent among the respondents. Based on these results, public education is warranted to rectify these misconceptions.",

Although human-to-human transmission of H5N1 is inefficient [3] , a conservative estimate of the effect on human health of an antigenic shift of the H5N1 virus is that up to 7.4 million deaths would occur worldwide [4] . In 1997, the first human H5N1 cases were reported in Hong Kong; this outbreak consisted of 18 human cases with six deaths [5] . Only two human cases of H5N1 influenza were reported in Hong Kong in 2003, despite intermittent reports of small numbers of dead birds being H5N1 carriers [6] . Hong Kong and other countries have since instigated H5N1 preparedness plans to control potential outbreaks, which primarily involve hospital infection control measures.",

            "text": "During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic period from March through June 2003 in Hong Kong, disease-related perceptions in the general population not only changed dramatically over a short period of time, but they were associated with community panic levels and the adoption of prevention behaviors [7] . Public perceptions of H5N1, such as the low perceptions of its seriousness and lack of control of external causes of the outbreaks, are often at odds with the efforts put in place to control its spread [8] . Results obtained from our earlier baseline studies showed that unconfirmed beliefs about H5N1 disease transmission modes were also prevalent in Hong Kong and associated with immediate behavioral responses, particularly avoidance behaviors, such as the avoidance of eating poultry meat and the avoidance of crowded places [9] . A small-scale outbreak of human H5N1 in Hong Kong would cause increased psychological distress and the adoption of preventive behaviors in the general population [10, 11] . We also found that H5N1-related perceptions were associated with higher anticipated psychological distress and the adoption of personal prevention behaviors [10, 11] . Perceptions and anticipated community responses, however, do change over time. We subsequently conducted five additional surveys that were comparable to the aforementioned baseline study with the aim of monitoring changes in perceptions and anticipated community responses. The results are reported in this paper. The study reported here therefore monitored-over a 28-month study period-trends in H5N1-related risk perceptions, anticipated psychological responses, and anticipated personal preventive behaviors in the case that two to three new human-to-human H5N1 cases would be reported in Hong Kong.",

Random numbers were generated by the computer to represent page number, column. and row numbers. Six rounds of cross-sectional telephone surveys were conducted: survey 1, November 2005 (n = 503); survey 2, March 2006 (n = 501); survey 3, August 2006 (n = 502); survey 4, January 2007 (n = 501); survey 5, August 2007 (n = 770); survey 6, February 2008 (n = 750). A total of 3,527 individuals were therefore phoned during a 28-month period; the calls were placed between 6:30 and 10 p.m. to avoid an overrepresentation of unemployed people. The baseline study was conducted with a separate funding source, and surveys 2-6 were implemented roughly at 6-month intervals according to the study protocol. The eligible household member, whose last birthday was closest to the date of the survey, was invited to participate the study. Prospective participants were briefed on the study, and verbal informed consent was obtained before the commencement of the anonymous interview. At least three other independent telephone calls were made at different hours and days to those unanswered telephone numbers before the number was defined as invalid. Similar telephone survey methods have been used in a number of published studies related to SARS and H5N1 influenza [7] [8] [9] [10] [12] [13] [14] . The response rate, defined as the number of completed interviews divided by the number of eligible households, was close to 60%. Approval for the study was obtained by the Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",

Potential human-to-human transmissions had also been documented [17] . Therefore, the actual threat from H5N1 therefore did not dissipate during the study period. Extrapolating the answers of our respondents to the general population, however, it would appear that the general public in Hong Kong is responding rationally to this potential threat. Over time, high proportions of the general population worried less about a large-scale epidemic outbreak, showed increasing confidence in the governmental preparedness, and perceived lower susceptibility in contracting H5N1. In contrast, lower proportions of the study population believed that the human H5N1 would cause severe damage or would have unfavorable disease-related havoc (e.g., infectivity, fatality, epidemic duration), showed mental distress, or believed that the reporting of a few new human H5N1 cases would have a large impact on oneself. Compared to the baseline data, the prevalence of anticipated avoidance behaviors and the use of face-masks in public areas had also decreased by 20-30% at survey 6. Moreover, although the vast majority of the respondents at survey 6 believed that there was no effective treatment or vaccine for H5N1, neither of these two beliefs was associated with the mental distress dummy variable. All of these findings consistently suggest that the likelihood of community panic and irrational reactions at the initial phase of an H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong has been decreasing. These trends mirrored the epidemiological data on inefficient human-to-human transmissions and reporting of geographically scattered human H5N1 cases. H5N1 has drawn less media attention, and reports on H5N1 have become less strident over time.",

The effectiveness of the face-mask in preventing influenza transmission is, however, controversial [18] , although a local study showed that it did contribute to the control of SARS [19] . The psychological impact of a masked city may damage the economy and, in addition, relevant government guidelines on face-mask use in public venues would be required.

Moreover, the general public greatly underestimated the fatality rate of H5N1. Unlike the clustering of SARS cases, reporting of human H5N1 cases tended to be sporadic. Rectification of this misconception on the risk of fatality may result in shorttime community distress, but the public would be better prepared to face the reality in the long run.

Although self-reported responses may be slightly biased from social desirability, general trends in the data should still be valid. The response rates were modest but comparable to those of similar local studies [12-14, 21, 22] . Over time, there was a lack of significant changes as there were no human cases reported in Hong Kong, while such cases were reported intermittently in other countries. It should also be pointed out that while the declines from survey 1 to survey 5 were, in general, consistently observed, the change at survey 6 tended to be larger than previous changes. There is no particular explanation for these larger changes, although it can be speculated that by the end of the study period, H5N1 had received very little media attention for a relatively long time.
