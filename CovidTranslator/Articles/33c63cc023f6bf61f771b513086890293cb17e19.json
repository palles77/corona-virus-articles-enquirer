Methods: 2010-2015 incidence data for influenza A (IAV), influenza B (IBV), respiratory syncytial (RSV) and parainfluenza (PIV) virus infections were collected from 18 sites (14 countries), consisting of local ( n = 6), regional ( n = 9) and national ( n = 3) laboratories using molecular diagnostic methods. Each site submitted monthly virus incidence data, together with details of their patient populations tested and diagnostic assays used.",

The tropical sites Singapore and Kuala Lumpur showed fluctuating incidence of these viruses throughout the year, whereas subtropical sites such as Hong Kong, Brisbane and Sydney showed distinctive biannual peaks for IAV but not for RSV and PIV. Conclusions: There was a notable pattern of synchrony of IAV, IBV and RSV incidence peaks globally, and within countries with multiple sampling sites (Canada, UK, Australia), despite significant distances between these sites.",

[31] [32] [33] [34] [35] However, it is clear from the literature that international collaborations are increasing, in an effort to pool and compare such contemporaneous epidemiological data, to improve our understanding of how these respiratory viruses are behaving -not just within our local or national populations, but simultaneously across the world. Although national surveillance data are invaluable to reveal how these viruses are behaving and moving through populations, and also capture the incidence of viral infections in the community to some extent, the bulk of that population's healthcare burden may be more accurately represented by the routine diagnostic testing data obtained from patients who were sufficiently ill to be admitted to hospital.",

The influenza and RSV seasons generally last 3-4 months, Fig. 4 . Patterns of viral incidence between geographically closely related cities within the same counties. Note that the incidence peaks for influenza A (IAV), influenza B (IBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and (where available) parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3) are more or less coincident for Leicester-Cambridge, Brisbane-Sydney, and Vancouver-Edmonton-Halifax, despite the variable and large distances between these cities within the same country. The coincidence is less obvious when all subtypes of PIV are grouped and compared. In contrast, note that there is much less synchrony between the incidence peaks of these viruses in the Singaporean and Malaysian populations. * Sydney and Edmonton do not have PIV3 specific data.",

Whilst the recurring, predictable seasonality of IAV, IBV and RSV has been reported by single centre or country, or even several countries, this study has shown that this phenomenon appears to be occurring simultaneously in multiple countries sharing the same Northern or Southern hemisphere, which cannot be demonstrated with a series of individual, singlesite studies, or multiple-site studies confined to the Northern or Southern hemisphere alone.",

It has also been shown that RSV is also an important cause of hospitalization and death in some adults. 41 This further supports the WHO's recent BraVe initiative in tackling some of the non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRVs). 7 Whilst we acknowledge that the nature and pattern of this data will be affected by the specific populations fitting the individual testing criteria at each contributing site, the widely recognised universality of RSV as a major cause of pediatric morbidity makes such testing criteria likely similar at each site, such that the patterns of RSV incidence obtained from these INSPIRE network laboratories are very likely globally generalizable and real.",
