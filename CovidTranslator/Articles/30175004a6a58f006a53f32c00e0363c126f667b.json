Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 was transformed with segments of vP4 of the porcine rotavirus inserted into the pNZ8112 surface-expression vector, and a recombinant L. lactis expressing VP4 protein was constructed. An approximately 27 kDa VP4 protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and immunostaining analysis. BALB/c mice were immunized orally with VP4-expression recombinant L. lactis and cellular, mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses were examined. Specific anti-VP4 secretory IgA and IgG were found in feces, ophthalmic and vaginal washes and in serum. The induced antibodies demonstrated neutralizing effects on porcine rotavirus infection on MA104 cells. Our findings suggest that oral immunization with VP4-expressing L. lactis induced both specific local and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses in mice.",

There are three groups of rotaviruses that affect humans and animals, which are referred to as group A, B, and C on the basis of the group-specific inner capsid protein VP6 [2] . Group A rotaviruses are the most common agents that cause diarrheal disease in the young of not only humans but also many animal species including piglets. The core of porcine rotavirus is composed of double-stranded RNA arranged in 11 genome segments. Segment 4 encodes VP4 outer capsid protein on the rotavirus surface, which not only defines viral P serotypes, but is also a potent protective immunogen [3] ; VP4 protein can independently elicit neutralizing antibodies resulting in protective immunity. The antigenic functional region from the 5 end of VP4 is encoded by a 756-bp fragment that includes the trypsin region of VP8 at the C terminus and VP5 at the N terminus [4] .",

Gut innate immunity provides the first line of defense against pathogenic microorganisms and also initiates acquired immune responses. Thus, oral vaccines present an ideal immunoprophylactic strategy for eliciting protection against this type of infection. However, an obstacle in the generation of oral vaccine formulations is maintaining immunogenicity while simultaneously avoiding being denatured in the presence of the gastric environment. Therefore, we designed a delivery system resistant to the gastrointestinal environment by engineering a L. lactis VP4 expression vector. In this study, the potential of using L. lactis to express heterologous rotavirus VP4 protein and its ability to act as an antigen delivery carrier for oral vaccination were analyzed. The immunogenicity of the recombinant VP4-expressing L. lactis was analyzed by oral administration of live bacteria in the BALB/c mice. Our data indicate that oral inoculation of VP4expressing L. lactis can induce specic immune responses, both in the mucosal and systemic immune systems in a mouse model study, which is useful for the subsequent evaluation of immune responses with recombinant L. lactis as a potential rotavirus oral vaccine in pigs.",

            "text": "Many lactic acid bacteria (LAB) vectors used to express and deliver heterologous pathogen antigens have been constructed in recent years [16] [17] [18] [19] . The discovery of such vectors offers a new way to explore live bacterial vehicle vaccines for the prevention of infectious diseases, especially in mucosal infectious diseases. In this paper, we constructed a surface-expression recombinant L. lactis pNZ-VP4/NZ9000, and VP4 expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot analysis, and immunostaining. Balb/c mice were immunized orally with recombinant L. lactis expressing VP4, and cellular, mucosal, and systemic immune responses were examined. We found that VP4-expressing recombinant L. lactis induced both local and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses against the VP4 rotavirus while using mice as model animals. Group A rotaviruses, the main agents associated with significant diarrheal disease in humans and animals, are nonenveloped viruses containing 11 RNA fragments. Outer capsid proteins are of importance in infection and immunity. VP4, a nonglycosylated outer capsid protein [20] , has been implicated as a virulence determinant in mice and piglets [21] . VP4 also induces neutralizing antibodies [22, 23] , and antibodies directed against VP4 neutralize the virus in vitro [24, 25] and passively protect mice against heterologous rotavirus challenge in vivo [26] . Further studies have shown that VP4 effectively induces protective immunity in animals Figure 5 : Anti-VP4-specific IgA responses. Specific anti-VP4 IgA was measured in fecal (a), vaginal washes (b), or lacrimal fluids (c). Mice were orally immunized with 10 9 CFU of pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 and pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000, respectively. The immune protocol was administered on three consecutive days: immunization at days 0, 1, and 2; a booster at days 14, 15, and 16; and a second booster at days 28, 29, and 30 (the arrows on the Xaxis indicate the times of vaccination and boosters). Samples from fecal extracts, vaginal washes, and lacrimal fluids were analyzed for the presence of specific Anti-VP4 IgA by ELISA. The OD value of each replicate well is the one of the mixture of two samples; the bars represent IgA mean OD values in four wells representative of eight samples, which were detected at different time points for each group. [27, 28] . Proteolytic cleavage of VP4 into VP5 and VP8 results in an enhancement of viral infectivity [29, 30] . DNA vaccines encoding the murine rotavirus proteins VP4, VP6, or VP7 can induce rotavirus-specific serum antibodies and virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses generated by each of the three vaccines, but virus-neutralizing antibodies could be detected only in mice that were inoculated with DNA vaccines encoding for VP4 and VP7 [31] . VP6 DNA vaccine did not provide significant protection against a rotavirus challenge [32] . Therefore, the VP4 protein plays a major role in porcine rotavirus immune prophylaxis. Since the VP4 protein is associated with protective immunity, we used it as a target antigen to evaluate its immunogenicity as a potential mucosal vaccine. Mucosal immunity is the first barrier in the prevention of infections beginning via the mouth, respiratory, and genital tracts. Stimulation of mucosal immunity is most efficiently induced following oral immunization, as it stimulates the production of sIgA and elicits systemic immunity. However, one obstacle in the development of effective oral vaccines is that target antigens are often unable to withstand denaturing in the environment of the stomach and intestinal tract before reaching the surface of the intestinal mucosa and effectively stimulating gut-associated lymphatic tissue. One strategy that can be used to overcome this is to develop a live expression vector that can both properly deliver and express the heterogenic antigen and survive in the intestinal milieu [17, 18] . We investigated the potential adhesion and persistence of cFDA-SE-labeled L. lactis NZ9000 orally fed to mice in the intestines. At day 7 following inoculation, the amounts of L. lactis NZ9000 that remained adherent to the intestinal mucosa were 69.76%, 51.59%, and 60.67% of those on the first day in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, respectively (data not shown). Lactococcus provides an excellent expression system, because it is safe and can persist in the intestinal mucosa. In addition, the long-term use of Lactococcus in the food industry supports the beneficial use of these kinds of organisms. L. lactis is one of the primarily utilized species in the food industry, in fermentation and in medicine. L. lactis grows rapidly and can be processed easily, making it an ideal expression vector for exogenous gene products [33] [34] [35] .",

These organisms have been shown to be good live vehicles for the delivery of antigens for mucosal immunization. Currently, our research is under way to determine whether the recombinant Lactococcus lactis expressing porcine rotavirus VP4 protein could be used to stimulate mucosal and systemic immunization and to produce the protective anti-VP4 antibodies after mucosal vaccination in porcine model. Serial dilutions of the antisera of mice immunized with pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 and control sera immunized with pNZ8112/NZ9000 were mixed with an equal volume of 100 TCID 50 rotavirus at 37 \u2022 C for 1 hour, respectively, and MA104 cells were then infected with the virus-serum mixture. Cytopathicity was strongly inhibited by the addition of the antiserum of mice immunized with pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the control sera could not inhibit virus-induced cytopathicity, indicating that the protective antigen-specific antibody responses in sera from the mice immunized orally were generated by our intervention.",

Therefore, an oral porcine rotavirus vaccine must induce a specific mucosal IgA response. We used BALB/c mice as an animal model and evaluated the immunogenicity of VP4-expressed recombinant L. lactis following oral administration. Mucosal antibody secretory IgA (sIgA) was detected in feces vaginal and ophthalmic washes. Specific anti-VP4 sIgA can be obtained in feces via the oral route as well as in vaginal and ophthalmic washes, indicating that VP4-expressed recombinant L. lactis is able to elicit both local and systemic mucosal immune responses, which is important for specific resistance to respiratory and genital tract infectious diseases but not intestinal infectious diseases. From our experiments investigating the detection of mucosal sIgA and serum IgG after a prime vaccination, a booster at a two-week interval apparently increased the production of anti-VP4 sIgA, but a second booster did not seem to increase the sIgA titer much higher than that of the first booster. These results indicate a more rational vaccination procedure that would need to be administered to obtain a satisfactory antibody response. An oral administration regime was used in this study, which consisted of three sets of three successive daily doses of the VP4-expression recombinant L. lactis as the experimental vaccine. This protocol was adapted from the procedure of Challacombe [13] , who found that this pattern of immunization was consistently effective when particulate oral vaccines were used to immunize mice. Whether this procedure is suitable for L. lactis expression in mice immunization needs to be further tested in future experiments.",
