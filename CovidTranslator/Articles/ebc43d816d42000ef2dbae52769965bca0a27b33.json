At present, little is known about how viruses overcome IFITM restriction. In this study, we have utilized HIV-1 as a model and selected IFITM1resistant viruses after multiple passages of HIV-1 in IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells. Sequencing the entire viral genome revealed several mutations in the vpu and envelope genes, among which mutations Vpu34 and EnvG367E together enable efficient HIV-1 replication in IFITM1-expressing cells. Vpu34 introduces a stop codon at amino acid position 35 of Vpu, whereas EnvG367E changes the G367 residue at the CD4binding site of gp120. These two mutations do not appear to overcome the downregulation of viral p24 expression caused by IFITM1, but rather enhance HIV-1 replication by promoting cell-to-cell virus transmission. Altogether, our data demonstrate that HIV-1 can mutate to evade IFITM1 restriction by increasing cell-to-cell transmission.",

The antiviral functions of some of these ISGs have been well characterized. Examples include the RNase L and OAS proteins, protein kinase R (PKR), myxovirus-resistance (Mx) proteins, ISG15, APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G), TRIM5\u03b1 (Tripartite motif-containing protein 5\u03b1), tetherin, SAMHD1 (SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1) and Schlafen 11 (Hrecka et al., 2011; Laguette et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Neil et al., 2008; Sadler and Williams, 2008; Stremlau et al., 2004) . A recent addition to this list is the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins which inhibit a number of highly pathogenic human viruses (Brass et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2011; Schoggins et al., 2011; Weidner et al., 2010) . IFITM proteins are distinct from all other ISGs in that they inhibit viral entry, particularly the step of membrane fusion (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2011) (reviewed in (Diamond and Farzan, 2013; Perreira et al., 2013) ).",

            "text": "Humans have IFITM1, 2, 3, 5 and 10, all of which are located on chromosome 11 (Hickford et al., 2012) . IFITM1, 2, 3 and 5 are clustered in a 26.5 kb region, whereas IFITM10 is located 1.4 Mb apart. IFITM5 is also called bone-restricted IFITM-like (Bril) protein due to its strict expression in osteoblasts and its role in bone mineralization and maturation (Hanagata et al., 2010; Moffatt et al., 2008) . The function of IFITM10 is unknown, but it is highly conserved in different species (Hickford et al., 2012) . IFITM1, 2 and 3 have been shown to promote anti-proliferation, homotypic cell adhesion, and apoptosis (Brem et al., 2003; Deblandre et al., 1995; Evans et al., 1993 Evans et al., , 1990 . They are also overexpressed in some tumor cells, such as human colorectal tumors, suggesting a possible role in oncogenesis (Andreu et al., 2006; Siegrist et al., 2011) . In addition to their ubiquitous expression in different tissues (Seo et al., 2010; Yamashita et al., 2000) , IFITM1, 2 and 3 also respond to the stimulation by interferon (Lewin et al., 1991) , supporting their roles in host antiviral defense. Indeed, IFITM1, 2 and 3 have been reported to inhibit the infections by influenza A virus (IAV), flavivirus (West Nile virus, Dengue virus, and Yellow Fever virus), filovirus (Ebola virus and Marburg virus), SARS coronavirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), reovirus, Rift Valley fever virus, as well as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Anafu et al., 2013; Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2011; Mudhasani et al., 2013; Raychoudhuri et al., 2011; Schoggins et al., 2011; Contents Weidner et al., 2010) . In addition to this broad antiviral activity, knockout of ifitm3 in mice or IFITM3 deficiency in humans renders the hosts highly vulnerable to IAV infection (Bailey et al., 2012; Everitt et al., 2012; Wakim et al., 2013) , highlighting the importance of IFITM proteins in host antiviral defense in vivo.",

            "text": "Human IFITM1, 2 and 3 are of 125, 132 and 133 amino acids in length, respectively. They are predicted to have two transmembrane domains (Siegrist et al., 2011) . Results of cell-surface immunostaining and flow cytometry experiments suggest that their amino-and carboxy-termini project toward the extracellular space or luminal compartments (Brass et al., 2009; Weidner et al., 2010) . However, recent evidence also supports the cytoplasmic localization of the N-terminus (Bailey et al., 2013; Yount et al., 2012) . In addition to the plasma membrane, IFITM proteins are also observed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endosomes (Alber and Staeheli, 1996; Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Jia et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2007; Yount et al., 2010; Zucchi et al., 2004) . The localization of IFITM3 in late endosomes is important for inhibiting IAV infection, because ectopic expression of IFITM3, or its induced expression by interferon, causes expansion of late endosomes and lysosomes and results in the sequestration of endocytosed IAV particles in these acidic membrane compartments (Feeley et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011) . By taking advantage of lipid analogs and fluorescence labeling, we recently showed that oleic acid (OA), but not chlorpromazine (CPZ), rescues the inhibitory effect of IFITMs on cell-to-cell fusion induced by Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) Env and IAV hemagglutinin (HA), indicating that IFITM proteins interfere with the hemifusion stage of virus entry, possibly by changing membrane fluidity and curvature (Li et al., 2013) . This conclusion is further strengthened Fig. 1 . Identification of escape mutations. (A) Replication of wild type HIV-1 and the escape viruses named HIV-1(R) in IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells. The same amounts of viruses were used to infect SupT1 cells expressing IFITM1 with induction by doxycycline. Amounts of viruses in the supernatants were determined by measuring the viral reverse transcriptase activity. The expression of IFITM1-Flag in SupT1 cells was examined by Western blotting with doxycycline (Dox) induction. (B) Illustration of the escape mutations in HIV-1 genome. Seven viral DNA clones were sequenced. The frequency of each mutation in seven clones is shown. (C) Vpu28 and Vpu34 mutations cause premature termination of Vpu translation. Part of the DNA sequences and amino acid sequences of the wild type and mutated Vpu are shown. The Vpu fragments of the Vpu28 and Vpu34 mutants are illustrated. (D) Mutations EnvR311K and EnvG367E are located in the V3 and C3 regions of envelope protein, respectively. The g7178a mutation does not cause amino acid change. Part of the DNA sequences and amino acid sequences of the EnvR311K and EnvG367E mutations are presented. Locations of these two mutations in the gp120 structural model are shown. The structural models were generated using the I-TASSER server for protein 3D structure prediction (Zhang, 2008) . by the fact that IFITM proteins increase lipid order of membranes (Li et al., 2013) . This latter property of IFITM proteins is at least partially attributed to their interaction with VAPA (vesicle-membrane-protein-associated protein A) and consequent disturbance of cholesterol homeostasis (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013) .",

Indeed, HCV infection increases the expression of miR-130a that targets the 3 0 untranslated region of IFITM1 mRNA and thus diminishes IFITM1 expression (Bhanja Chowdhury et al., 2012) . Additionally, arenaviruses, which require low pH for entry, are refractory to IFITM restriction (Brass et al., 2009) , although the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. In order to better understand the viral evasion of IFITM restriction, we investigated whether HIV-1 can develop resistance to IFITM1 in CD4 \u00fe SupT1 cells. The results showed that long-term culture led to the emergence of IFITM1-resistant HIV-1 mutants, and the escape mutations were mapped to the viral Vpu and Env proteins.",

In order to investigate whether HIV-1 is able to develop resistance to IFITM restriction, we grew HIV-1 in IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells and observed that the virus gradually became refractory to IFITM1 inhibition and replicated to high levels ( Fig. 1A) . As a control, we also grew HIV-1 in SupT1 cells without ectopic expression of IFITM1 for the same time interval. We then sequenced the entire genomes of these two virus populations. Five mutations were identified only in IFITM1resistant viruses, not in those that had replicated in the control SupT1 cells (Fig. 1B) . Two mutations are located in Vpu, namely Vpu28 and Vpu34, respectively. Vpu28 was seen in two out of the seven sequenced viral DNA clones, Vpu34 in five clones, indicating that the virus either carried the Vpu28 or the Vpu34 mutation. Both mutations created a stop-codon, resulting in the premature termination of Vpu translation (Fig. 1C) . The other three mutations were found in the Env coding region (Fig. 1B) . EnvR311K resides in the variable loop 3 (V3), which is critical for co-receptor-binding ( Fig. 1D ). EnvG367E is in the CD4-binding site in constant region 3 (C3) (Fig. 1D ). The g7178a mutation does not cause any amino acid change in envelope, nor in the Rev or Tat proteins. This mutation was found in five out of the seven sequenced DNA clones. These data suggest that HIV-1 is able to escape from IFITM1 inhibition by mutating its Vpu and Env proteins.",

Since Vpu28 and Vpu34 mutations both resulted in truncation of Vpu, and Vpu34 was seen in five out of seven viral DNA clones, we chose to further characterize Vpu34 by performing the following experiments. We inserted Vpu34, EnvR311K, EnvG367E and g7178a into the HIV-1 proviral DNA either individually or in different combinations, and generated 11 mutated HIV-1 DNA clones (Table 1) . We then transfected these viral DNA clones into HEK293T cells to produce viruses, and used viruses of the same viral p24 amounts to infect SupT1 cells that were induced with doxycycline to express IFITM1. Infection experiments were also performed without doxycycline as the control for the IFITM1-negative condition. In the absence of IFITM1 expression, HIV-1(Mut4) (containing Vpu34, EnvR311K, EnvG367E and g7178a mutations), Vpu34/ EnvG367E, and Vpu34/EnvR311K/G367E grew slightly faster than the wild type virus and other viruses (Fig. 2) . With IFITM1 expression, viruses HIV-1(Mut4), Vpu34/EnvR311K/G367E, and Vpu34/EnvG367E exhibited much robust replication, in strong comparison to the wild type and other mutants which were inhibited by IFITM1 (Fig. 2) . We thus conclude that the Vpu34 and EnvG367E mutations together are sufficient to overcome IFITM1 inhibition, and that EnvR311K and g7178a do not play an important role.",

To test whether the Vpu34 and EnvG367E mutations can overcome this defect, SupT1 cells were infected with the same amounts of wild type and mutated HIV-1 particles, and viral Gag/p24 expression was measured by staining cells with FITC-conjugated anti-p24 antibody.

This observation was confirmed by the results of Western blots measuring cell-associated HIV-1 Gag and p24 (Fig. 4B , 200 ng p24 virus infection). This deficiency was likely a result of the impaired virus entry, since results of HIV-1 virion fusion experiments showed that the HIV-1(Mut4), Vpu34/EnvG367E and EnvG367E mutants were more than 10 fold less efficient in Table 1 Mutations in each HIV-1 mutant.",

Such a mutation would be expected to diminish the affinity of envelope for CD4. Indeed, we observed that as little as 0.1 mg/ml of soluble CD4 (sCD4(D1/D4)) was able to reduce the infection of wild type HIV-1 and the Vpu34 virus by 10-fold, as opposed to less than 30% decrease for the EnvG367E, Vpu34/EnvG367E and HIV-1(Mut4) viruses (Fig. 5A) . We further tested the usage of CD4 receptor using an antibody named VRC03 that recognizes the CD4-binding site on gp120 Zhou et al., 2010) . Again, viruses HIV-1 (Mut4), EnvG367E and Vpu34/EnvG367E, which all carry the EnvG367E mutation, exhibited greater resistance to VRC03 inhibition than the wild type virus (Fig. 5B) . We speculated that the diminished usage of CD4 by the EnvG367E mutant may render the virus more sensitive to the cell surface CD4 level. To test this possibility, we first used the CD4 antibody SIM4 to block cell surface CD4 and then measured its effect on HIV-1 infection. The results showed a much greater inhibition of the Vpu34/EnvG367E and EnvG367E viruses as compared to the wild-type HIV-1 and the Vpu34 mutant (Fig. 5C ). Next, we used shRNA to knock down CD4 expression in SupT1 cells. Out of the four shRNA clones tested, one clone diminished CD4 level by approximately 40% (Fig. 5D) , the other three did not significantly affect CD4 expression (data not shown). This CD4knockdown SupT1 cell line was then infected by either the wild type HIV-1 or the HIV-1(Mut4) virus. Compared to their replication in the control SupT1 cells, the growth of HIV-1(Mut4), but not the wild type HIV-1, was delayed in the CD4-knockdown cells (Fig. 5D) . Results of Fig. 5E and F further showed that the Vpu34 and EnvG367E mutations did not affect the usage of CXCR4 as the co-receptor, since all mutated viruses were as sensitive as the wild type virus to the inhibition by the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (Fig. 5E) , and none was inhibited by the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (Fig. 5F) . These results suggest a deficient engagement of CD4 by the mutated viral envelope EnvG367E.",

            "text": "It is intriguing that the Vpu34/EnvG367E virus particles were 10-fold less infectious than the wild type HIV-1 (Fig. 4 ), yet this mutant replicates as efficiently as does the wild type virus in SupT1 cells (Fig. 2) . We also noted that, although infection of the mutated viruses was initially impaired as shown by the results of Western blotting at day 2 after infection, the HIV-1(Mut4) and Vpu34/EnvG367E mutants produced similar levels of viral p24 as compared to wild type HIV-1 at day 4 and day 8 after infection (Fig. 4B ). Given that cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 is known to dominate virus spread over free-virus infection (Sattentau, 2008) , it is possible that the Vpu34/EnvG367E mutant compensates for its reduced infectivity by enhancing cell-to-cell transmission. To test this, we first infected the donor SupT1 cells with the wild type or mutated HIV-1 particles bearing the VSV-G protein, ensuring that both wild type and mutated HIV-1 would generate similar numbers of infected donor cells. Forty hours after infection, donor cells were mixed with target SupT1 cells that were labeled with a cell tracker BMQC, and viral p24 was examined with FITC-conjugated anti-p24 antibody. In order to distinguish cell-to-cell transmission from free virus particles, we used trans-wells to separate donor cells from target cells. As would be expected, few p24-positive cells were detected in the trans-well infection (Fig. 6A) , indicating that free HIV-1 particles did not lead to significant infection of target cells. We then added HIV-1 fusion inhibitor T-20 into the mixed cell population and did not observe significant infection of target cells (Fig. 6B) , confirming that the cell-to-cell virus transmission shown in Fig. 6C is viral envelope-dependent. When the control SupT1 cells (without IFITM1 expression) were used as the target cells in the transmission assay, the HIV-1(Mut4) and Vpu34/ EnvG367E mutants were 3-4 fold more efficient at cell-to-cell transmission than the wild type virus or the Vpu34 and EnvG367E mutants (Fig. 6C) . We next used IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells as target cells, and observed that IFITM1 did not markedly affect HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission (Fig. 6D) . Again, Vpu34 and EnvG367E mutations together enhanced the transmission of viruses from donor cells to IFITM1-expressing target cells (Fig. 6D) . In order to validate these data, we measured the amount of HIV-1 late cDNA in the mixed of donor and target SupT1 cells at time 0 and 8 h after mixing. The increases of HIV-1 late cDNA over a 8-h period of coculture are 4.6 and 3.7 folds for HIV-1(Mut4) and Vpu34/ EnvG367E, but are less than 2-fold for wild type HIV-1, Vpu34 and Env367E (Fig. 6F) , which suggests a much higher cell-to-cell transmission efficiency for HIV-1(Mut4) and Vpu34/EnvG367E. Therefore, we conclude that the Vpu34 and EnvG367E mutations rescue HIV-1 replication in IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells through promoting cell-to-cell virus transmission.",

This transmission deficiency was likely caused by the EnvG367E mutation, because both EnvG367E and Vpu34/ EnvG367E were incompetent in cell-to-cell transmission, yet the Vpu34 mutant spread more efficiently than the wild type virus (Fig. 8A) . To dissect whether this transmission deficiency is of donor or target cell-effect, we performed additional cell-to-cell transmission assays using SupT1 as donor and CEM cells as target cells, or vice versa. The results showed that the HIV-1(Mut4), EnvG367E, and Vpu34/EnvG367E mutants transmitted efficiently only when SupT1 served as target cells (Fig. 8B-D) , suggesting that the target cell type determines the cell-to-cell transmission efficiency of the EnvG367E-containing HIV-1 mutants.

The Vpu34 mutation creates a translation stop codon at the amino acid position 35 (Fig. 1C) , resulting in the expression of the first 34 amino acids of Vpu that form the transmembrane domain. We ruled out the involvement of this 34-amino-acid Vpu fragment in antagonizing IFITM1, because eliminating the full-length Vpu expression by mutating the translation start codon AUG also enabled the EnvG367E mutation to rescue HIV-1 replication (Fig. 3) . Together, our results indicate that the loss of Vpu and a mutation in Env (EnvG367E) are both critical for HIV-1 to evade IFITM1 restriction. We also detected the R311K mutation in the V3 loop of Env, but this mutation does not appear to contribute significantly to circumventing IFITM1. Nonetheless, mutating the V3 loop may represent one way for the virus to counter different inhibitory pressures. This scenario is supported by a recent study showing that feline immunodeficiency virus is able to escape from inhibition by a N-terminal fragment of TSG101 by acquiring a K410N mutation in the V3 loop of its Env protein (Luttge et al., 2013) .",

Because the Vpu34 mutant replicated almost as efficiently as the wild type HIV-1 in SupT1 cells (Fig. 2) , despite of its inability to downregulate the cell surface CD4 (Fig. 3B) , Vpu is dispensable for HIV-1 to replicate in SupT1 cells. This could result from the lack of endogenous tetherin expression in SupT1 (Rong et al., 2009 ), which alleviates the need for Vpu to antagonize tetherin. It is possible that, in the face of both tetherin and IFITM1, both of which can be induced by IFN, HIV-1 would have to overcome these two restrictions by evolving pathways other than mutating Vpu alone.",

Interestingly, this defect does not apparently affect the replication of the EnvG367E mutant in SupT1 cells, and Vpu34 and EnvG367E together enhance the viral growth in SupT1 cells as compared to the wild type virus. How can HIV-1 tolerate such a deleterious mutation as EnvG367E? One possibility is that SupT1 cells express relatively high level of CD4 (Fig. 7B) , which could support the EnvG367E mutant to efficiently transmit from cell to cell (Fig. 6 ). In addition, given that EnvG367E is unable to replicate in T cell lines other than SupT1, SupT1 cells may express a factor(s) that allow the replication of EnvG367E mutant.",

            "text": "We found that the Vpu34 and EnvG367E mutations were unable to overcome the defect in viral p24 expression caused by IFITM1 (Fig. 4) . Instead, they enhanced the HIV-1 transmission between SupT1 cells by $4-fold, indicating that the enhanced replication of these mutants in SupT1 cells are due to cell-to-cell transmission. It is possible that such a gain in cell-to-cell transmission allows HIV-1 to evade different types of restrictions. This Vpu34/EnvG367E-dependent pattern requires SupT1 as the target cells (Fig. 8) , which suggests that certain features of the infected target cells promote the formation of virological synapse. These features may include high CD4 level at cell surface as a result of losing Vpu and high level of the EnvG367E envelope that has a weak affinity for CD4 and therefore is less likely trapped at the ER as a result of CD4 binding. Alternatively, the Vpu34/ EnvG367E mutant may be efficient in entry via cell-associated routes. It is currently unclear which of these possibilities promotes HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission. It is interesting to note that a previous study by Gummuluru and colleagues has reported a Vpu mutation called Rap5, which is very similar to Vpu34 (Gummuluru et al., 2000) . Rap5 was selected in a rapid turnover assay performed in Jurkat cells, resulting in a frameshift of Vpu and leading to the expression of its first 32 amino acids, which is remarkably similar to the Vpu34 mutation reported here. Importantly, Rap5 also rescued HIV-1 replication by promoting cell-to-cell spread of virus, which is related to accumulation of Rap5 viruses on the cell surface, despite that Rap5 had no apparent effect on the expression of Env. This mechanism was further supported by a later study showing that, in the absence of Vpu, tetherin promotes HIV-1 cell to cell transmission (Jolly et al., 2010) . Although this virus particle retention mechanism may not operate for Vpu34 in SupT1 cells that do not express tetherin, the virus manages to evolve a second mutation G367E in envelope protein that, together with Vpu34, achieves higher transmission efficiency to escape IFITM1 inhibition. Apart from enhanced cell-to-cell transmission, we also observed that the EnvG367E virus caused a delayed cytopathogenecity during infection of SupT1 cells as compared to the wild type virus (data not shown), suggesting that the attenuated binding of EnvG367E to CD4 likely also diminishes cell fusion/killing and thereby allows the infected cells to produce more viruses. IFITM1 has been shown to inhibit entry of a number of enveloped viruses, including IAV, Yellow Fever virus, SARS coronavirus, Ebola virus, etc. (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013) . Interestingly, it does not appear to restrict HIV-1 by impeding entry (Lu et al., 2011) . Instead, IFITM1 reduces HIV-1 Gag/p24 expression in virus producer cells, which results in diminished virus production. Interestingly, we found no evidence that the escape mutations would overcome this latter defect. While it is possible that the effect of IFITM1 on HIV-1 is cell type specific and virus-strain dependent (Brass et al., 2009) , the identification of the escape mutations that promote HIV-1 cellto-cell transmission, as reported here, demonstrates that HIV-1 can evolve a mechanism to evade IFITM1 restriction. We envision that similar mechanisms are also operative for other viruses that are restricted by IFITMs.",

Second, shortterm infection of the SupT1 cells. SupT1 cells were first exposed to viruses equivalent to 200 ng viral p24 antigen. Forty hours after infection, the infected cells were washed with cold 1 \u00c2 phosphatebuffered saline and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. The infected cells were stained with anti-HIV-1 p24 antibody and scored by flow cytometry. Third, long-term infection of SupT1 cells. SupT1 cells were infected with virus equivalent to 10 ng viral p24. Viral replication was monitored by measuring the levels of viral reverse transcriptase activity in supernatants over various time intervals. Lastly, we used the CEM-Rev-Luc cells to examine the sensitivity of HIV-1 to inhibition by different agents. The CEM-Rev-Luc cells express luciferase in a qHIV-1 Rev-dependent manner (Wu et al., 2007) . These cells are a gift of Dr. Yuntao Wu (George Mason University).
