We previously developed a strategy to recover prototype reovirus strain T3D from cloned cDNAs transfected into murine L929 fibroblast cells. Here, we report the development of a second-generation reovirus reverse genetics system featuring several major improvements: (1) the capacity to rescue prototype reovirus strain T1L, (2) reduction of required plasmids from ten to four, and (3) isolation of recombinant viruses following transfection of baby hamster kidney cells engineered to express bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. The efficiency of virus rescue using the 4-plasmid strategy was substantially increased in comparison to the original 10-plasmid system. We observed full compatibility of T1L and T3D rescue vectors when intermixed to produce a panel of T1L \u00d7 T3D monoreassortant viruses. Improvements to the reovirus reverse genetics system enhance its applicability for studies of reovirus biology and clinical use.",

            "text": "One of the most transformative technologic advancements in virology has been the development of reverse genetics systems for nearly all major groups of RNA-and DNA-containing viruses. Although the molecular design and methodologic details of these systems vary, their common feature is the availability of cloned cDNAs encoding viral genomes that can be manipulated and subsequently used to isolate viruses containing engineered changes in genomic nucleic acids. RNA virus rescue systems typically entail intracellular transcription of full-length genomic or antigenomic RNAs from plasmids transfected into permissive cells, frequently in conjunction with transient expression of essential components of the viral replicase (Bridgen and Elliott, 1996; Collins et al., 1995; Fodor et al., 1999; Garcin et al., 1995; Lawson et al., 1995; Neumann et al., 1999; Racaniello and Baltimore, 1981; Schneider, Schwemmle, and Staeheli, 2005; Schnell, Mebatsion, and Conzelmann, 1994; Whelan et al., 1995; Yoneda et al., 2006) . Furthermore, translational competence of (+)-strand RNA virus genomes has enabled rescue of infectious virus from cells following introduction of in vitrogenerated genomic RNAs free of viral proteins (Almazan et al., 2000; Coley et al., 2005; Gritsun and Gould, 1995; Kinney et al., 1997; Racaniello and Baltimore, 1981; Rice et al., 1989; Yount et al., 2003; Yun et al., 2003) . Development of a fully plasmid-based reverse genetics strategy for double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses of mammalian species, which includ e coltiviruses, orbiviruses, reoviruses, and rotaviruses, has trailed other major systems owing in part to the technical complexities involved in manipulation of a multipartite genome containing ten or more segments. We have developed a reverse genetics system for mammalian reovirus (Kobayashi et al., 2007) , a nonenveloped, double-layered particle containing ten dsRNA gene segments (Schiff, Nibert, and Tyler, 2007) , and used this system to engineer changes in both structural and nonstructural proteins for studies of reovirus replication and pathogenesis (Boehme and Dermody, In Press; Danthi et al., 2008a; Danthi et al., 2008b; Kirchner et al., 2008; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Kobayashi et al., 2009; Zurney et al., 2009 ).",

These plasmids are presumed to generate transcripts identical in sequence to reovirus-generated (+)-strand RNAs that serve as templates for translation and dsRNA synthesis in infected cells. The primary round of reovirus replication is initiated by cotransfection of all ten plasmids into murine L929 (L) cells infected with a replication-defective vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. Following five days of incubation, recombinant strain (rs) viruses are isolated from co-transfection lysates by plaque assay using L cells. The global replication behavior and strain-specific phenotypes of rs viruses studied to date are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the natural parental isolates (Danthi et al., 2008a; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Kobayashi et al., 2009) . These results demonstrate that the reovirus reverse genetics system is a biologically plausible approach to study viral replication and pathogenesis, optimize viral oncotropism, and develop reovirus as a live, naturally attenuated vaccine vector for diverse pathogenic microorganisms.",

T1L and T3D display numerous phenotypic differences including receptor usage, activities of viral replication proteins, regulation of the interferon response to reovirus infection, apoptosis induction, growth in various types of primary and transformed cells, and virulence, dissemination pathways, and cell and tissue tropism in newborn mice (Schiff, Nibert, and Tyler, 2007) . Reassortant viruses derived from co-infections of T1L and T3D have been used to define the genetic basis of several of these biologic polymorphisms. Such analyses have provided key insights into viral replication and disease mechanisms. A marker rescue system for T1L does not exist. However, the availability of tools to derive infectious T1L particles starting with plasmid templates would greatly expand the potential utility of reovirus reverse genetics by permitting any desired combinatorial exchange of T1L and T3D gene segments and providing an alternative genetic background to optimize cell targeting and vectoring capacity.",

The electropherotype of rsT1L was indistinguishable from that of native strain T1L. To exclude the possibility that rsT1L represents contamination by native T1L, a unique PmlI site in the L3 gene was destroyed by the introduction of two silent point mutations into the L3 rescue plasmid: C to T at nucleotide 2059 and G to C at nucleotide 2062 ( Figure  2B ). An 1189 bp fragment of the L3 gene was amplified using RT-PCR of viral dsRNA extracted from T1L and rsT1L virions. The L3 gene RT-PCR product derived from T1L was digested with Pm1I to produce 586 bp and 603 bp fragments, whereas the L3 product derived from rsT1L was not ( Figure 2C ), indicating that rsT1L originated from plasmids. To ascertain whether rsT1L and native T1L have similar replication kinetics, yields of rsT1L and T1L were quantified following infection of L cells at an MOI of 2 PFU/cell ( Figure 2D ).

Therefore, a primary goal of this study was to generate a reverse genetics system for T1L.

Here, we show production of T1L virions from cloned cDNAs. Similar to rsT3D and native T3D, the replication characteristics of rsT1L reflect native T1L. Growth kinetics, total yields, inclusion morphology, and genomic electrophoretic signatures were indistinguishable between T1L and T3D. These results further validate retention of native viral properties by plasmid-derived viruses. Moreover, development of the T1L rescue system will expand the utility of reverse genetics for studies of reovirus biology.",

This observation suggests there may be interactions among viral proteins, RNAs, or both that influence reovirus evolution. Additionally, compensatory mutations that promote viral replication efficiency may be necessary to stabilize certain genetic combinations (Roner et al., 1995) . Prior to this study, it was unclear whether generation of all 20 single-gene T1L \u00d7 T3D reassortant viruses would be feasible due to uncertainties about the replicative fitness of gene constellations not previously isolated in T1L \u00d7 T3D reassortant panels. Development of a fully plasmid-based rescue system for T1L will now allow systematic characterization of gene segment co-evolution and may facilitate isolation of viruses with replication impediments or combinations of T1L and T3D genes normally disfavored in mixed infections (Nibert, Margraf, and Coombs, 1996) .",

However, the current system is limited by the inefficiency of transfection of ten plasmids (Kobayashi et al., 2007) . Therefore, a second goal of this study was to improve viral yields by reducing the number of plasmids required for virus recovery. This goal was accomplished by combining two or four transcriptional cassettes in a single plasmid, reducing the total number of plasmids from ten to four. Compared to the first-generation marker-rescue system, the 4-plasmid strategy enhanced efficiency of virus recovery by reducing time to virus isolation and supporting increased total yields. The improved reverse genetics system also offers the economic advantage of requiring fewer reagents and less preparation time. Interestingly, recovery of T1L appears to be more efficient than T3D using either the 4-or 10-plasmid reverse genetics system. While the simplest explanation is that T1L exhibits an intrinsic replication advantage over T3D in cell lines used for virus rescue, another possibility is that different gene arrangements between the T1L and T3D 4-plasmid systems contribute to higher yields of T1L. Whether genetic linkage within the rescue constructs affects virus production is unknown.",

First, since fewer plasmids are required to simultaneously enter a cell, the probability is increased that a full set of viral RNAs will accumulate to a critical threshold for replication initiation. While plasmids are provided in vast excess, there may be a limit to the amount of plasmid that can enter a single cell. Second, it is possible that only a small fraction of transfected plasmids avoid degradation and remain competent for transcription. By decreasing the number of plasmids from ten to four, the likelihood that a single cell will contain a sufficient number of intact transcription cassettes is enhanced. Third, it is possible that constraining transcription and translation of individual viral RNAs to the same intracellular microenvironment, as might be anticipated for multicistronic vectors, facilitates essential protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions required for virus recovery.",

Early reverse genetics systems for influenza virus required co-transfection of 12-16 plasmids encoding viral mRNAs or proteins (Neumann et al., 1999) . Subsequently, the number of required plasmids was reduced to eight; each containing a viral gene flanked by both pol I and pol II promoters that drive viral genomic and messenger RNA expression, from the same cDNA (Hoffmann et al., 2000) . As these systems were practical only in cell types supporting high transfection efficiencies, further improvements were achieved by combining eight RNA pol I transcription cassettes for viral RNA synthesis into a single plasmid and condensing three of the four protein expression cassettes onto one plasmid. The resulting three-plasmid system increases efficiency of virus production in Vero cells, which are amenable to propagation of influenza vaccines for use in humans (Neumann et al., 2005) . Hence, reverse genetics of viruses containing segmented genomes appears to be inherently inefficient, but this problem is surmountable through plasmid reduction.",
