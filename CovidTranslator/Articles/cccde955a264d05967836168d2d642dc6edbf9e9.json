Circumstances can however, change dramatically due to emergencies, disasters, or pandemics and may make it difficult to meet the standard of care in the way nurses are accustomed. The Australian nursing profession has not yet facilitated a broad discussion and debate at the professional and institutional level about adapting standards of care under extreme conditions, a dialogue which goes beyond the content of basic emergency and disaster preparedness. The purpose of this paper is to encourage discussion within the nursing profession on this important ethical and legal issue. A comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken to determine the state of the evidence in relation to adapting standards of care under extreme conditions. Content analysis of the literature identified categories related to adapting standards of care that have been considered by individuals or groups that should be considered in Australia, should a dialogue be undertaken.",

The current expectations by the community and health professionals of a high level of technically supported health care may not be achievable for a number of reasons. If there is no electric power or running water or if buildings are blown away or are underwater, or a limited number of personnel are able or willing to work (Gebbie et al., 2009) . One definition of 'standard of nursing practice', articulated by the American Nurses' Association (ANA) states that ''they are the rules or definition of what it means to provide competent care. The registered professional nurse is required by law to carry out care in accordance with what other reasonably prudent nurses would do in the same or similar circumstances'' (American Nurses Association, n.d.) .",

This highlighted the importance of a discussion on the expectation on whether standards of care should remain constant, are able to be adapted or need to be changed in the face of major disasters; (2) the relationships between legal requirements and the provision of care during disastrous events. This involves having clear documented expectations for practitioners so that they feel confident in making the decision to adopt standards of care or not without fear of legal reprisal; (3) the exploration of the potential differing ethical perspectives of resource rationalisation and allocation between hospital and public health priorities. The perspectives raised in relation to this category explored the importance of understanding which one of these health service areas may need to draw on more than normal resources to meet the surge capacity in an immediate or evolving disaster situation, especially when there is a shortage of human and material resources. It may be that public health becomes the main focus of a response and draws upon resources from the hospital sector, particularly when pandemics are experienced; and (4) the degree to which dialogue is a necessary foundation for making care decisions in situations of a largescale emergency or resource shortage within and among health practitioners. The dialogue should include legal practitioners, health service leadership personnel, policy makers (within and outside of government), and the public at large. This category reflects the importance of involving the community in understanding that access to and the type of care may change if there is a major disaster and resources are short. It is best for the community to understand this before an event, rather than seek to complain during or after a disaster when the focus needs to be on the rapidly changing environment.",

This gap in the literature suggests that there may be the need to have some dialogue on the challenges to professional practice during an extreme event that limits resources or pushes care into unfamiliar environments. This is to enable nurses to be well-prepared to make appropriate changes such as frequency of vital signs observations, assisted ambulation, oral intake or medication intervals, or the use of family and volunteers for supportive tasks. Nurses in Australia who are familiar only with practice in a modern, technologically sophisticated environment, or in community settings well-connected by computer and telephone to tertiary consultation resources, may not have considered what it would be like to provide care in a situation without electrical power, with no incoming supplies, or with limited external communication.",
