Can sequence patterns influence recognition? And how can we infer those patterns from sequence data? Here, we detail recent computational and experimental evidence associated with sequence-specific sensing. We review the mechanisms underlying the detection and discrimination of foreign sequences from self. We also describe quantitative approaches used to infer the stimulatory capacity of a given pathogen nucleic acid species, and the influence of sequence-specific sensing on host-pathogen coevolution, including endogenous sequences of foreign origin. Finally, we speculate how further studies of sequencespecific sensing will be useful to improve vaccine design, gene therapy and cancer treatment.",

A pioneering study showed that a metric based on dinucleotide usage could adequately discriminate a random contiguous segment of human DNA from a random contiguous segment of bacterial DNA [3] . The primary dinucleotide that enforces this discrimination is CpG. Indeed, CpG methylation of DNA, a feature vastly more prevalent in mammals than bacteria, promotes cytosine deamination, leading to accelerated cytosine to thymine mutation. Thus, CpG methylation is thought to account for underrepresentation of CpG motifs in mammalian genomes.",

Hence, the same pattern detected computationally to discriminate mammalian and bacterial genomes is associated with an actual innate receptor performing the same task. Subsequently, new methods were introduced to computationally identify such discriminatory motifs. One approach introduced further constraints on genomes, fixing not just nucleotide frequency but also the coding sequence of a virus and its codon usage. By randomizing the genome sequence while fixing these constraints, it is possible to identify patterns that discriminate pathogen and host genomes, independently of their effect on the codon usage or amino acid sequence [5] .",

These approaches thus become ill suited to longer genomes or whole transcriptome analyses, where the size of the dataset requires more efficient methods. Motivated by this issue, the problem was recently recast using methods from statistical physics, which avoid tedious genomic randomizations to find atypical patterns [6] . The computational speed associated with this improved conceptual language allows larger datasets, such as eukaryotic transcriptomes, to be efficiently analyzed. In this framework, one defines a force on a genomic pattern as the information entropy cost for a genome to have that pattern at the observed frequency. In other words, a pathogen pays a measurable evolutionary cost to reorganize the information in its genome in a non-random way in order due to the influence of specific sequence patterns targeted by a PRR, reaching an equilibrium with its host that balances between the selective forces on the pattern and randomizing entropic forces. As a consequence when a pathogen changes hosts, potentially encountering a new set of PRRs, it will evolve towards a new equilibrium between PRRs and sequence entropy.",

The same immunostimulatory potential of certain dinucleotides was suggested by genomic analyses that identified a pervasive suppression of CpG and UpA dinucleotides in RNA viruses infecting mammals [7] [8] . Later, an evolutionary survey of influenza A upon transition from avian to human hosts suggested a selection pressure against CpG dinucleotides in A/U rich contexts [5] . Interestingly, this motif pattern is highly under-represented in the sequences of several human innate immune genes, such as the type I interferon (IFN-I) family. These RNA, expressed at high quantity almost exclusively during the response to viral infection, may have evolved to avoid further immune stimulation, which could create a positive feedback loop [9] . Similarly, in a study comparing the dinucleotide usage patterns of Flaviviridae viruses infecting vertebrate or invertebrate organisms, the vertebrate-infecting viruses display a decreased CpG frequency not observed in insect-only viruses [10] .",

Yet another feature comprises large secondary RNA structures observed in several RNA virus families. Their presence has been linked to viral fitness, in vivo persistence and escape of innate immune detection [11] . Furthermore, as for many viral families, lentiviruses, such as Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), possess a genome with a significant nucleotide ratio bias compared to human genes [12]. One hypothesis explaining this biased composition is that, as a retrovirus, HIV is subject to innate pressure from RNA editing enzymes such as APOBEC3G, which can edit cytosine nucleic acids in a motif specific fashion, inducing a mutational bias [13] . Likewise, an analysis of different HIV-1 virus subtypes has uncovered a correlation between HIV-1 nucleotide bias, its ability to elicit an innate immune response, and its pathogenicity [14] . Thus, while there is evidence that some specific immunostimulatory motifs are being selected against, microbial sequences also evolve under both intrinsic and host-related constraints, leading to some pattern usage biases not necessarily identical to those of their hosts.",

Taking advantage of the genetic code's degeneracy, this strategy consists of replacing whole portions of viral genomes with sequences either enriched for or depleted of the pattern of interest, without altering the protein coding sequence. Pioneering studies introduced rare codons in the capsid-coding region of poliovirus genome and observed that it led to viruses with altered replication fitness, lower virulence and infectivity [16] [17] . Similar strategies, including alterations in codon usage, codon pair usage, and/or dinucleotide content also led to viral attenuation, the mechanisms of which are currently under investigation. Depending on the studies, authors have thus far reported inhibition of protein synthesis [17] [18] [19] [20], inhibition of viral cDNA synthesis [21] or reduction of virion infectivity [17] [22] . Interestingly, several of these investigations, listed in Table 1 , found that modification of viral genomes modulates their interactions with the innate immune system. Of note, a team generated two non-replicative influenza virus mutants in which the viral PB1 polymerase gene was replaced by a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. One virus contained a GFP sequence with 21 (A/U)CG(A/U) motifs, while the other contained only 2. Upon infection of human primary plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the mutant with more CpG motifs elicited higher levels of interferon-\u03b1 [23] .",

A different team produced a mutant of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) with optimized nucleotide composition by lowering nucleotide bias in the pol gene, resulting in increased CpG frequency, and overall reduction of dinucleotide bias [27] .

The structure of mouse TLR13 bound to a 13-nt ssRNA derived from 23S rRNA has also been characterized. When bound to TLR13, the ssRNA folds into a stem-loop-like structure that is different from its usual shape in the bacterial ribosome, and that is also required for activation of TLR13. However, most of the ssRNA nucleotides make basespecific contacts with the surface of TLR13, accounting for its sequence specify [81] .

A study showed that a uridine-rich tetramer is the minimal sequence required to elicit TLR7 and TLR8 responses and further suggested TLR8 has increased specificity for AUrich sequences, while TLR7 has a comparatively heightened specificity for GU-rich sequences [31] . A second investigation found that endogenous nucleic acid sequences induced a level of TLR7 activation in murine B cells directly proportional to their uridine- content, and, particularly, to the frequency of two motifs, U(C/G)U and U(U/A)N [32] . The crystal structure of TLR8 in complex with ssRNAs showed that the receptor contains two ligand-binding sites and that synergistic binding of both sites to their respective ligand is required for signal transduction. The first site binds a uridine residue and the second binds a short guanosine-containing oligoribonucleotide, like UG [33] . After crystallization, intact ssRNA was not observed bound to the TLR8 structure, suggesting TLR8 binds products of ssRNA degradation catalyzed by yet unknown nucleases and phosphatases [33] . A follow-up study performed on TLR7 showed that it also contains two ligand-binding sites. Indeed, TLR7 acts as a dual receptor that binds both guanosine and uridine-containing ssRNA. Interestingly, the ssRNA-binding site is spatially and structurally distinct form that of TLR8. However, as for TLR8, synergistic binding of both ligands is required for efficient activation [34] . Interestingly, use of guanosine derivatives such as Resiquimod (R848) shows chemicals with a minimal nucleotide structure can act as agonist of both TLR7 and TLR8 [35] .",

Indeed, depending on its sequence, a DNA strand will act either as TLR9 agonist or antagonist [36] . The TLR9 immunostimulatory CpG motif, which consists of a hexamer with a central unmethylated CpG, was first described as RRCGYY, with R representing a purine and Y a pyrimidine [4] . In humans, the CpG motif with formula GTCGTT has been proposed as an optimal ligand [37] . The crystal structure of TLR9 has been characterized. Using agonist 12-mer oligonucleotides, it was found that the consensus hexamer sequence, and no other part of DNA, is directly recognized by TLR9 [38] . TLR9's specificity for CpG motifs and their flanking sequences is determined by precise van der Waals' interactions and water-mediated hydrogen bonds between multiple TLR9 amino acids and DNA bases. Of note, TLR9 recognizes CpG in DNA sequence only. However, CpG dinucleotide are also suppressed in many RNA viruses, which do not produce DNA at any step of their replication cycle. Thus, it's likely that TLR9 specificity drives CpG suppression in DNA viruses for example, but is unlikely to be involved in ssRNA and dsRNA viruses genome shaping. Additionally, the backbone phosphate is needed for recognition. In another study, TLR9 has been shown to recognize DNA:RNA hybrids [39] . Curiously, ssDNA fragments isolated from these hybrids were not potent in activating TLR9, presumably due to the absence of CpG motifs. Overall, these results suggest an intriguing dependency of TLR9 sequence specificity to the nature of its ligand.",

MDA5-MDA5 binds dsRNA independently of its terminal moieties and, according to structural studies, without any direct sequence specificity. Indeed, MDA5 interacts primarily with the phosphate backbone and 2\u2032 hydroxyl groups of ribose in dsRNA, using it as a platform to stack along dsRNA in a head-to-tail arrangement. The cooperative binding of MDA5 on longer dsRNA increases its affinity, eventually leading to the proper activation of downstream signaling pathways [51] .

This is the case for TLR3, which was initially identified as a dsRNA receptor [87] . It has been shown that dsRNA must meet a minimum length of 40 base pairs to activate TLR3 [88] . The crystal structure of human TLR3 complexed to dsRNA demonstrates that TLR3 recognizes the phosphate backbone of dsRNA, but makes minimal contacts with bases, confirming sequence-independent sensing [89] . Yet, several reports have since suggested RNA structures other than perfect stretches of dsRNA activate TLR3, including structures formed by bacterial and host ssRNAs [90] . These studies indicate that specific sequences may form self-RNA duplexes recognized by TLR3. Similarly, Protein Kinase R (PKR) is a PRR activated by several distinct RNA secondary structures including dsRNA, short stem-loop RNAs flanked by single-stranded tails, and misfolded RNA with structural defects, like the bulges and internal loops often found in microbial transcripts [91] .",

A study recently performed in yeast shows that the DEAD-box protein Dhh1p (an ortholog of human helicase Ddx6) is able to sense codon bias in cellular mRNA and induce a selective decapping and decay of biased mRNA [93] . The authors propose a mechanism where Dhh1p preferentially binds to mRNAs with high codon bias, owing to an additional interaction of Dhh1p with ribosomes, which are known to stall and accumulate during the translation of non-optimal codons stretches. According to the authors of this study, Dhh1p would thus be able to sense ribosomal speed and induce the selective degradation of codon-biased mRNA. These results echo back an older study showing that Schlafen 11, an interferon stimulated gene, could restrict retroviral infection in a codon-usage-dependent manner, this time by modulating the cellular tRNA levels during HIV infection [94] . Given the strong involvement of DEAD-box proteins in innate immunity and their ability to interact with several innate immune adaptors [95] , analyzing the role of Ddx6 and its homologs in sensing microbial sequences may unravel interesting mechanisms linking codon adaptation and pathogen sensing.",

Reactivation of these normally silenced elements has been associated to autoimmune diseases [67] . Studies on Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) have linked the excessive IFN-I response characteristic of this condition to mutations in nucleases such as TREX1 and RNAseH. These mutations may result in inappropriate accumulation of nucleic acids and subsequent activation of RNA and DNA sensors such as MDA5 and cGAS [68] [69] . In the mouse, artificial activation of Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) has been shown to increase the expression of IFN-I and ISGs [70] . Interestingly, silenced endogenous sequences can be activated by innate immune responses, suggesting a role for these sequences in signal amplification. For instance, exposure to environmental microbes causes global modulation of endogenous retroelement transcription [71] . Moreover, treatment with IFN-I induces transcription of the short interspersed element (SINE), Alu, which in turn stimulates the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in a TLR7-dependent manner. The authors of this study were able to identify a specific Alu sequence motif, normally bound to RNA binding protein Ro60, as immunostimulatory [72] . Similarly, activation of the B cell response with T cell-independent type 2 antigens induces transcription of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) RNAs, which are then detected via DNA and RNA sensing pathways [73] . Interestingly, this mechanism can be hijacked by viral infections. Of note, Herpes virus infection leads to the expression of SINE elements, enhancing viral replication and gene expression through activation of the antiviral NF-\u03baB pathway [74] . Thus microbial activation of retroelement expression may function to further alert and amplify the presence of an invading pathogen.",

Although some of them can differ in sequence from self-RNA (Fig. 1) , the connection of specific viral sequence patterns embedded in retroelements to their observed immunostimulatory activity has yet to be established. One particular subclass of pericentromeric repeats, the human repeat human satellite repeat II (HSATII), is greatly overexpressed in certain cancers [78] . It has been shown that HSATII sequences are enriched in the motif pattern of CpG dinucleotides in AU-rich contexts, whose detection induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines [79] . In addition to their atypical dinucleotide composition, pericentromeric repeats display other similarities with retroviral RNAs, including their ability to be reverse-transcribed [80] . Altogether, these results strengthen the proposition that endogenous retroelements bear functional roles in initiating immune responses during cancer development. ",
