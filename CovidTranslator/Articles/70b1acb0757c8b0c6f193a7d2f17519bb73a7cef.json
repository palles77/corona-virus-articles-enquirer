Optical sections were acquired with a spinning disc confocal microscope and after deconvolution, Zstacks were used for 3D reconstruction. The movie was generated with the Imaris 8 software package and shows the proximity of NS3/NS4B-containing punctae to DENV-induced elongated mitochondria. Figures 1 and 2) . (A) Huh7 cells stably expressing the mTurquoise2 fluorophore fused with the COX8 mitochondria-targeting signal (mito-mTurquoise2) were generated by lentiviral transduction. Cells were infected with the reporter virus DVs-R2A (MOI=0.1) and Renilla luciferase activity (RLU), used as a readout of DENV replication, was measured 24, 48 and 72 hours post-infection (hpi). Note that the reporter cells support DENV replication comparably to the parental non-transduced cells. AU: arbitrary units. (B) Huh7-mito-mTurquoise2 cells were infected with DVs (MOI=1). Three days post-infection, cells were fixed, permeabilized and NS3 was detected by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. Scale bar: 10 \u00b5m. (C) Live cell imaging frame captures of uninfected Huh7-mito-mTurquoise2 cells. Captures were made 20, 28, 36, 44 and 52 hours after a two-hour mock-infection and show a normal mitochondrial network. To facilitate tracking, two cells of interest are labeled with \u03b1 and \u03b2. Scale bar: 10 \u00b5m. (D) Huh7 cells stably expressing mito-mTurquoise2 and YFP-Sec61\u03b2 were generated by lentiviral transduction. Cells were infected with the DENV reporter virus DVs-R2A (MOI=0.1). Renilla luciferase activity (RLU) was measured 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-infection. Note that the simultaneous expression of the two fluorophore reporters has little effect on permissiveness to DENV. (E) Cells were infected with DVs (MOI=1). Three days later, cells were, fixed, permeabilized and NS3 was detected by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. Note the punctate staining pattern of NS3 that overlaps perfectly with YFP-Sec61\u03b2. Scale bar: 10 \u00b5m. Figure 2 ). Images of transversal sections of approximately 10 nm were acquired and used for 3D reconstruction. Reconstructed mitochondria are shown in red and DENV convoluted membranes in green.

The construction of pWPImito-mTurquoise2 will be described elsewhere (A.R. and K. Rohr, in preparation). For lentiviral constructs expressing DENV2 proteins, sequences corresponding to NS4A, NS4B, 2K-NS4B and NS4A-2K-NS4B were amplified using PCR and pTM-based expression plasmids (Chatel-Chaix et al., 2015) as templates. PCR products were inserted into the BamHI/SpeI cassette of the pWPI plasmid. pENTR221-hDNM1L (a kind gift of Dr. Nathan R.

For Western blot analysis, purified material was eluted with PBS containing 5% SDS and concentrated by acetone-mediated precipitation. For mass spectrometry-based identification of NS4B interactors, purified proteins were collected by three successive elutions using 100 \u00b5L of a 100 ng/\u00b5L HA peptide solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Pooled eluates were concentrated by acetone-mediated precipitation and submitted to GeLC-MS/MS (performed by the proteomics platform of the Institute of Microbiology, University of Greifswald, Germany). Protein composition of the resulting samples was determined using X!Tandem (version 2013.06.15 ). P-values from spectral counts were computed using the R/Bioconductor package DESeq and adjusted for multiple testing by the method of Benjamini-Hochberg (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) . A cellular protein was considered as a NS4B interaction partner when it was significantly enriched more than 8-fold (p \u2264 5x10-2) relative to the negative control which corresponded to cells infected with the non-tagged NS4B DENV that were processed in parallel.",

After washings, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS/5% BSA for two hours. After three washes with PBS, cells were subjected to one-hour incubation with AlexaFluor 488-, 568-, or 647-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were washed three times with PBS for 15 minutes each and nuclei were stained with DAPI for 10 minutes. Coverslips were mounted on slides with FluoromountG (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and examined with a Leica SP2 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica). For the quantification of mitochondria phenotypes, cells were observed with an inverted light microscope. The mitochondrial network of at least 100 cells per condition and experiment (2-6 independent replicates per virus) was examined and classified into three distinct categories (normal, fragmented and elongated morphology). A mitochondrial network was considered elongated when the elongation was observed at the whole cell level with at least 5 mitochondria longer than 15 \u00b5m (corresponding to the approximate diameter of a Huh7 cell nucleus). Mitochondria were classified as fragmented when \u2265 75 % of mitochondria appeared homogenously circular and with a diameter of ~1 \u00b5m in a dot-like pattern with no sign of elongation. Optical sections of 130 nm thickness were acquired with a Nikon TE2000-E inverted confocal microscope equipped with an Ultraview ERS spinning disc (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

Cells were washed with 0.1 M PHEM buffer and stored at 4\u00b0C until further processing in a PELCO BioWave Pro microwave processor (Ted Pella, Inc.). For post-fixation samples were incubated with 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 0.8% potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 ; Merck) in 0.1 M PHEM. Cells were rinsed with 0.1 M PHEM, incubated with 0.5% uranyl acetate in water, rinsed with water, dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol (25, 50, 75, 90 and 100%) and embedded with a graded series of Epon (Serva). Epon-infiltrated cells were incubated at 55\u00b0C to polymerize the resin. The part of the resin block containing the cells was mounted onto a SEM stub (Agar Scientific) using carbon sticker (Plano, GmBH, Wetzlar) and surrounded with silver paint (Pelco Colloidal Silver, Ted Pella Inc.) with the cells pointing upwards, perpendicular to the electron column. Samples were sputter-coated with gold (Quorum, GaLa Instrumente GmbH) for 120 sec at 30 mA. Images were recorded with a dual beam Auriga 60 FIB-SEM microscope (ZEISS), equipped with a gallium ion source for focused ion beam milling and a field emission gun scanning electron microscope. The specimen stage was tilted to 54\u00b0 and exposed to the focused ion beam in a way that the stage of the plane was parallel to the ion beam. Prior to milling and imaging, the sample surface was coated with platinum (~1 \u00b5m) using the gas injection system to cover the region of interest (on average 50 \u03bcm 2 ). All sample preparation and acquisition settings were performed using the Atlas3D software package (FIBICS Inc.). A cross sectional cut was introduced in two stages. First, a cut was made at high beam current (typically 16 nA) and at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV to create a trench that enabled viewing of the cross-section. In the second step, the ion beam was scanned using a current of 2 nA to polish and smooth the surface. SEM imaging was done using the ESB (back-scattered electron) detector at 1.5 kV, with a pixel size of 10 nm in x/y. For slice-and-view image series, a z-step of ~10 nm was chosen to remove the material from the specimen surface with the focused ion beam in order to obtain isotropic datasets. All acquired images were combined as a stack using the FIJI (ImageJ) software package and aligned using the TrakEM2 plugin. Finally, the contrast of all images was inverted to obtain the contrast of conventional TEM images. Organelles of interest were rendered using the IMOD software package (version 4.7).",

Two days posttransfection, lentivirus-containing medium was collected and filtered. Lentiviruses were titrated by transducing HeLa cells and subsequent treatment with 1 ug/ml puromycin. Five days later, cells were fixed and stained with 1% crystal violet/10% ethanol for 15-30 minutes. Stained cells were rinsed with water, colonies were counted and titers calculated taking into account inoculum dilution. For all experiments, transductions were typically performed using a MOI of 5 for Huh7 or 3 for A549 cells in the presence of 4 \u00b5g/mL polybrene. The pLKO plasmids TRCN0000001097 and TRCN0000082686 (Sigma Aldrich) were used to knockdown the expression of DRP1 and MFN2, respectively. The non-targeting shRNA-encoding plasmid SHC002 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as negative control and reference. Cell viability of transduced cells was evaluated using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega) measuring ATP amounts according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured with a Mithras LB940 plate reader (Berthold Technologies). The same transduction approach was used to produce Huh7 cells expressing YFP-tagged Sec61\u03b2 and mitochondria-targeted mTurquoise2. Cells expressing the latter were selected with 2 \u00b5g/ml zeocin and then, transduced with YFP-Sec61\u03b2-encoding lentiviruses. After double selection with 1 \u00b5g/mL puromycin and 2 \u00b5g/mL zeocin, cells were used for CLEM.
