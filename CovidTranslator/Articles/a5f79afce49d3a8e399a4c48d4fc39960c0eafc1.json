            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening form of atypical pneumonia that is caused by a newly identified virus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 7) . The disease emerged in southern China in late 2002 and spread worldwide. A total of 8,096 cases of SARS had been identified in 29 countries as of the end of 2003, and 774 patients had died; the fatality rate is 9.6% (World Health Organization [http://www .who.int/csr/sars/country/table 2004_04_21]). Despite the medical importance of this disease, an effective vaccine or therapy is not yet available. However, neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV has been broadly elicited in SARS patients (5) . It has also been reported that the transfer of mouse immune serum (passive immunity) has reduced pulmonary viral titers significantly in infected mice (8) . SARS-CoV is a member of the family Coronaviridae. The spike glycoprotein is a highly antigenic envelope protein and is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion (1, 4) . Therefore, human monoclonal antibodies to the spike protein may have potential as passive immunization reagents that can be used to reduce the rate of mortality from SARS-CoV infection. We report here on the generation of a human monoclonal antibody Fab fragment, AS3-3, to SARS-CoV spike protein from a combinatorial immunoglobulin gene library derived from two patients who recovered from SARS.",

The amplified gene was ligated with the pET22a vector and was then introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant protein was obtained as an inclusion body and was then refolded. The first screening of positive clones producing anti-SARS-CoV antibodies was performed essentially as described previously (2) . Briefly, approximately 5 \u03eb 10 3 E. coli colonies per 90-mm plate were grown on Luria broth agar containing 50 g/ml of ampicillin. Bacterial colonies were first transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were replaced on the surface of fresh plates containing 1 mM isopropyl-\u2424-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and ampicillin, and then they were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 6 h. The filters were treated with chloroform vapor and lysis buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 g of DNase per ml, and 40 g of lysozyme per ml overnight. After the filter was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the filter was blocked with PBST containing 5% skim milk. Each filter was incubated with 125 g of the recombinant spike protein of SARS-CoV and then with the sera from the patients who were the donors of lymphocytes. Positive signals on the filter were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat antibody to human immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Aurora, OH) and with an HRP-1000 immunostaining kit (Konica Co., Tokyo, Japan). Positive clones were identified in the original plates and were then cultured in 10 ml of super broth (30 g tryptone, 20 g yeast extract, 10 g 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid per liter, pH 7.0) containing ampicillin to an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of 0.8. Isopropyl-\u2424-D-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 100 M was added to the bacterial culture, which was then incubated overnight at 30\u00b0C for 12 h. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then sonicated. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 \u03eb g for 10 min, and supernatants were subjected to a second screening by ELISA.",

In the second screening of these three Fab clones by ELISA, only one clone, designated AS3-3, reacted specifically with the recombinant spike protein. In Western blotting analysis, AS3-3 reacted with a 30-kDa protein, as did the patients' sera and commercial rabbit polyclonal antibody to the SARS-CoV spike protein (data not shown). AS3-3 was further tested for its ability to bind to native SARS-CoV in infected cells by an indirect immunofluorescence assay; the result showed that AS3-3 specifically recognized infected cells but not noninfected cells (Fig. 1) . The affinity of AS3-3 to the recombinant protein was analyzed by a surface plasmon resonance assay; the association and dissociation constants were 5.05 \u03eb 10 7 M \u03ea1 and 1.98 \u03eb 10 \u03ea8 M, respectively. The heavyand light-chain genes were sequenced, and the deduced amino acids in the variable regions are shown in Fig. 2 .

It has also been demonstrated that 85.9% of serum samples obtained from 623 SARS patients contained neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV, and most of the neutralizing activities could be attributed to IgG (5) . The high IgG titers to SARS-CoV shown by ELISA were also confirmed in the two patients in our study. Recently, we have generated neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies to a surface lectin of the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica using combinatorial immunoglobulin gene libraries prepared from a symptomatic patient and an asymptomatic cyst passer (11) . Although the antibody titer in the cyst passer was lower than that in the symptomatic patient, the proportion of antibodies recognizing the surface antigen seemed to be higher in the asymptomatic individual. The use of lymphocytes from patients who recovered from symptomatic conditions would be a useful way to obtain neutralizing antibodies. The efficiency of using memory B cells from patients who recovered from SARS for the production of human monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV has also been demonstrated by the method of immortalizing B cells with Epstein-Barr virus (13) .",

Although the neutralizing activity of AS3-3 toward SARS-CoV has not yet been evaluated, the recombinant spike protein used for the screening in the present study (residues 258 to 573) includes the receptor-binding site. Recently, it has been reported that one of the neutralizing human single-chain variable-region 80R fragments binds to a similar part (residues 261 to 672) of the spike protein with a dissociation constant of 3.23 \u03eb 10 \u03ea8 M (9). Therefore, the affinity of AS3-3 to the spike protein demonstrated in this study seems to be 1.6-fold higher than that of the 80R single-chain variableregion fragment.",
