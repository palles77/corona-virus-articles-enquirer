Griffithsin molecules form a domain-swapped dimer, in which two b strands of one molecule complete a b prism consisting of three four-stranded sheets, with an approximate 3-fold axis, of another molecule. The structure of each monomer bears close resemblance to jacalin-related lectins, but its dimeric structure is unique. The structures of complexes of griffithsin with mannose and N-acetylglucosamine defined the locations of three almost identical carbohydrate binding sites on each monomer. We have also shown that griffithsin is a potent inhibitor of the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Antiviral potency of griffithsin is likely due to the presence of multiple, similar sugar binding sites that provide redundant attachment points for complex carbohydrate molecules present on viral envelopes.",

For these reasons, several such proteins, among them cyanovirin-N and scytovirin (Bokesch et al., 2003) , have been under active development as topical antiviral therapeutics. Most recently, another potent antiviral lectin, griffithsin, was isolated from the red alga Griffithsia sp., collected from the waters off New Zealand (Mori et al., 2005) . Griffithsin was shown to inhibit the cytopathic effects of different isolates of HIV-1 at concentrations as low as 43 pM (Mori et al., 2005) , and its binding to viral envelope glycoproteins was shown to be directly dependent on their glycosylation states. These properties make griffithsin a promising potential candidate for development as a future pharmaceutical agent.",

More careful analysis of the sequence of griffithsin indicates that this protein belongs to a diverse family of b-prism-I (or jacalin-related) lectins (Raval et al., 2004) and shares structural characteristics with proteins such as jacalin (Aucouturier et al., 1987) , artocarpin (Jeyaprakash et al., 2004) , and heltuba (Bourne et al., 1999) ( Figure 1A ). However, sequence identity between griffithsin and any of these other proteins is less than 30% (Mori et al., 2005 ) (see also Figure 1A ). Thus, structural details, particularly of the carbohydrate binding site(s), cannot be readily modeled, necessitating solution of an experimental structure. We report here the structures of griffithsin in three crystal forms, with and without bound carbohydrate molecules.",

            "text": "The structure of griffithsin was solved by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) with selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled protein produced in E. coli and was refined at high resolution with material grown in plants. Three different crystal forms of griffithsin were studied (Table 1 ). The fold of griffithsin corresponds to the well-known b-prism motif (Chothia and Murzin, 1993) , found mainly in a variety of lectins but also in some other proteins (Shimizu and Morikawa, 1996) . The motif consists of three repeats of an antiparallel four-stranded b sheet that form a triangular prism. However, unlike other lectins whose sequences are compared in Figure 1A , griffithsin forms an intimate dimer ( Figure 2 ) in which the first two b strands of one chain (consisting of 18 residues located at its N terminus) are associated with ten strands of the other chain (and vice versa). That arrangement is unique among the family members that have been described so far and is seen in all crystal forms of griffithsin, despite the presence of a significant nonnative N-terminal extension in one of them. Thus, griffithsin can be described as a domainswapped dimer, although it is not clear whether a corresponding monomeric forms does (or even could) exist. A considerable distance between the residues A18 and B19 (10.5 \u00c5 between their Ca atoms) is much larger than a corresponding distance in the domain-swapped proteins that have been shown to exist in both mono-meric and dimeric forms, such as, for example, another antiviral lectin, cyanovirn-N (Yang et al., 1999) . In our previous study that utilized size-exclusion chromatography, griffithsin was shown to exist as a homodimer in solution (Giomarelli et al., 2006) .",

Deletion of this residue may be related to the domain-swapped nature of griffithsin that differentiates this protein from all the other related lectins.

However, the six principal sites are arranged in two groups of three, one on molecule A and the other on molecule B, and are very similar in both structures. The only significant difference is that whereas the electron density in the lower-resolution structure (Figure 4 ) could be interpreted as resulting from the presence of exclusively a mannose, clear indications of the presence of an admixture of b mannose are seen in the atomic-resolution structure.

Based on the demonstrated promiscuity of griffithsin binding to oligosaccharides, it was hypothesized that griffithsin should be capable of binding to the spike protein of the SARS virus and inhibiting subsequent infection. The results of three different antiviral assays with the SARS virus showed that griffithsin could indeed inhibit both viral replication and the cytopathicity induced by the virus (Table 2) . Though griffithsin was active against the virus at nanomolar concentrations, it was not as active against the SARS virus as it is against HIV (Table 3) .",

Both monomers and dimers of cyanovirin-N could be isolated, whereas we have seen no indications of the existence of griffithsin in a monomeric form.

The other structurally closely related lectins ( Figures 1A and  3) contain either a single carbohydrate binding site, or at most two such sites, in each molecule. Although griffithsin shares structural homology with many mannoseor N-acetylglucosamine-specific lectins, its reported biological activity against HIV was >1000-fold better than those previously reported for several monosaccharidespecific lectins (Charan et al., 2000) . Of those lectins most closely related to griffithsin, only jacalin has been previously reported to exhibit anti-HIV activity (Corbeau et al., 1995) . Jacalin was, however, found to be relatively weak in its anti-HIV activity, not reaching an EC 50 level at a high dose of 10 mg/ml (227 nM) in the same whole-cell assay system in which griffithsin displayed an EC 50 = 43 pM (Mori et al., 2005) . The source of this enhanced potency and, presumably, higher affinity for HIV envelope glycoproteins, is of considerable interest. An explanation is suggested from the structure of griffithsin, which offers no less than six separate binding sites for mannose in a compact domain-swapped dimer. The enhanced binding potential for the high-mannose oligosaccharides present on the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 to be gained from this multivalency is significant. The sites on each monomer are much closer than in the lectins that belong to the b-prism-II family, presumably allowing tighter binding of complex carbohydrates. Similar enhancement was seen in previous studies on the anti-HIV protein cyanovirin-N, which detailed the increased relative binding affinity, due to multivalent interactions, of this domain-swapped dimer for high mannose oligosaccharides (Shenoy et al., 2002) . Initial attempts at the crystallization of griffithsin with larger oligosaccharides have shown signs that similar multivalent binding to these carbohydrate structures occurs (Charan et al., 2000) 9 8 Urtica diocia agglutinin a (Charan et al., 2000) 105 P. tetragonolobus lectin a (Charan et al., 2000) 5 2 N. pseudonarcissus lectin a (Charan et al., 2000) 9 6 Myrianthus holstii lectin a (Charan et al., 2000) 150 Scytovirin (Bokesch et al., 2003) 0 . 3 Cyanovirin-N 0 . 1 Griffithsin a (Mori et al., 2005) 0.04 a Monosaccharide-specific lectins.",

The specificity of griffithsin for monosaccharides was at first thought to be a disadvantage for this protein's potential as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent. However, in some ways, the specificity displayed by griffithsin may be an advantage. It was previously speculated that griffithsin, due to its more promiscuous carbohydrate binding, might be active against viruses such as the coronavirus responsible for the recent SARS outbreak (Mori et al., 2005) . This prediction was based on the ability of griffithsin to bind a broader spectrum of oligosaccharide structures than other antiviral lectins such as cyanovirin-N (Bolmstedt et al., 2001) and scytovirin (Adams et al., 2004) . This prediction has proved to be true as recent data from anti-SARS assays has shown that griffithsin is indeed active against this virus at nanomolar concentrations, while both cyanovirin-N and scytovirin were inactive (data not shown). Whether or not this protein will prove to have any clinical utility as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for the treatment or prevention of viral infections remains to be answered, but its unique structure and interactions with carbohydrates, in addition to its unusual potency against HIV, provide ample justification for continued study.",

For the CPE assay, four log10 dilutions of griffithsin (e.g., 1000, 100, 10, 1 mg/ml) were added to triplicate wells of a 96-well flat-bottomed microplate containing the Vero 76 cell monolayer; within 5 min, the SARS virus was added, the plate was sealed and incubated at 37\u00baC, and CPE was read microscopically when untreated infected controls developed a 3 to 4+ CPE (approximately 72 to 120 hr). A known positive control drug (interferon a-n3) was evaluated in parallel with griffithsin. The data were expressed as 50% effective concentrations (EC 50 ).",

An EC 50 was also determined from this dye uptake. Decrease in Virus Yield Assay Following positive CPE inhibition and NR dye uptake results, griffithsin was retested both by CPE inhibition and, using the same plate, for effect on reduction of virus yield assay. Frozen and thawed eluates from each cup were assayed for virus titer by serial dilution onto fresh monolayers of Vero 76 cells. Development of CPE in these cells is an indication of presence of infectious virus. As in the initial tests, interferon a-n3 was run in parallel as a positive control. The 90% effective concentration (EC 90 ), which is the test drug concentration that inhibits virus yield by 1 log10, was determined from these data.",
