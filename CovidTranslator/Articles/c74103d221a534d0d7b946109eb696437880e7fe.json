Microbiol., 13: 189--200. Inoculation of tracheal organ cultures from bovine foetuses with Mycoplasma bovis resulted in a loss of cellular structure of the lamina propria, followed 20--22 days later by lifting and detachment of overlying epithelium. The effect was associated with large numbers of M. bovis, identified by immunoperoxidase labelling and electromicroscopy, infiltrating between the epithelial cells and amassing in the lamina propria, especially in the region of the basement membrane of the epithelium. Ciliary activity was undiminished for up to 18 days following inoculation and little or no cytopathic effect on the ciliated epithelium was seen in spite of the close proximity of large numbers of organisms.",

The cytopathology observed for each mycoplasma bore a close similarity to the behaviour of the two mycoplasmas in vivo and it is suggested that the organ culture system may be a useful and relevant system to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms for each mycoplasma.",

M. bovis is a significant pathogen for the bovine respiratory tract Thomas et al., 1986) ; it was thought therefore that a useful insight into its pathogenicity might be obtained by its inoculation into tracheal organ cultures and by comparison with another pathogen of the bovine respiratory tract, M. dispar (Thomas and HoWard, 1974; Howard et al., 1976) . This paper describes the results of this investigation.",

Rings were removed for sampling on Days 2, 4 and 14 (Experiment 1) and Days 2, 4, 8, 11, 15 and 22 (Experiment 3) . For Experiment 2 six tracheal rings from one of two foetuses were placed in a bottle in 10 ml of medium. Duplicate cultures from each foetus were inoculated with 0.1 ml of one of the four strains of M. bovis. The maintenance medium was sampled on Day 1 following inoculation and thereafter medium and tissue were sampled at 5-6 day intervals until the termination of the experiment on Day 28. The maintenance medium was also changed on the day of sampling. Sampled rings were divided into segments and pieces taken for estimation of Mycoplasma numbers, histology, including immunoperoxidase labelling, and electron microscopy (Experiment 3 only).",

By Day 22, some parts of the epithelial layer were still intact but in other areas there was lifting and detachment of the epithelium. The effect of M. bovis on the connective tissue cells of the lamina propria was striking: by Day 8 a significant loss of cell nuclei was apparent and by Day 15 little or no cellular structure, excepting a few epithelial cells lining the secretory glands, was discernible (Fig. 5) .

The capacity of M. bovis to penetrate between the cells of the respiratory epithelium without causing damage to those cells is remarkable and is in sharp contrast to the action of M. dispar, which, as described in an earlier paper (Thomas and Howard, 1974) and confirmed in the present study acts, entirely at the ciliated margin of the epithelial layer to produce its cytopathic effect. The ability of all four strains of M. bovis used to penetrate the respiratory epithelium and enter the intercellular spaces resembles to some extent the reported action of M. pneumoniae in organ cultures of hamster trachea (Collier et al., 1971) . However, M. pneumoniae attaches, forms clumps and is restricted to the ciliated margin of the epithelium; furthermore this organism appears to possess a special modification for attachment at this site, none of which was observed for M. bovis. Subsequent studies have also shown that M. bovis, in contrast to M. pneumoniae, is non-motile (W. Bredt and L.H. Thomas, unpublished observations) .",

The relatively slow onset of the cytopathic effect due to M. dispar compared with that seen earlier (Thomas and Howard, 1974 ) may be attributed to the low titre of inoculum used. This was designed to ensure that the onset of the cytopathic effect for each Mycoplasma might coincide; a high titre inoculum for M dispar (104--106.7 ccu ml -~) produced a marked cytopathic effect within 48 h (Thomas and Howard, 1974) . compatible with their behaviour in vivo. M. dispar causes an exudative bronchiolitis with peribronchiolar and alveolar round cell infiltration whereas M. bovis appears to be a more invasive pathogen, causing extensive coagulative necrosis in lung parenchyma with apparently little effect on the respiratory epithelium (Thomas et al., 1986) . Some caution should be used, however, in interpreting in vivo effects for these Mycoplasma from their behaviour in organ culture; although a progressive penetration of M. bovis from the epithelial layer to the lamina propria was apparently demonstrated, the cut, transverse surface of the tracheal ring does expose the lamina propria for direct penetration by the mycoplasmas. The colonisation of the peritracheal connective tissue by M. bovis is probably an artefact but nevertheless the lack of cytopathic effect in this location is surprising. The work described here supports the view that M. bovis is second only to M. mycoides subsp, rnycoides in its pathogenicity for bovine tissue. The mechanism whereby M. bovis produces its cytopathic effect remains to be elucidated. A toxin has been described for M. bovis (Geary et al., 1981) and the relevance of such a toxin to its pathogenicity in lung tissue discussed (Thomas et al., 1986 ). However we have, to date, been unable to demonstrate any toxic effect for organ cultures using a cell free filtrate of medium from cultures infected with M. bovis (Thomas and Howard, unpublished observations) .",
