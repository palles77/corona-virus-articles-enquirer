However, their bioavailability remains to be improved compared with that of chemical drugs. Here, we screened and identified a new peptide, Ctry2459, from a scorpion venom peptide library that was proven to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection via inactivating infectious viral particles. However, Ctry2459 cannot suppress established infection of HCV because of the poor cellular uptake and restriction of endosomes. Based on the molecular template of the Ctry2459 peptide, we designed two histidine-rich peptides (Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3) with significantly enhanced cellular uptake and improved intracellular distribution. Moreover, the two mutated peptides, as well as the wild-type peptide Ctry2459, exhibited virucidal activities against HCV. In distinct contrast to the Ctry2459 peptide, the mutated peptides significantly suppressed the established HCV infection at the cellular level but demonstrated lower cytotoxic and hemolytic activities. Our work presents an effective design strategy for optimizing natural antiviral peptides and opens a new avenue for enhancing the bioavailability of peptide drugs.",

Peptide drugs are advantageous because they are amenable to rational design and exhibit highly diverse structures and broad biological activities. Owing to this superiority, peptide drugs play significant roles as both therapeutics and biomarkers [1e3] . However, many obstacles must be overcome before peptide drugs can be applied clinically. Peptide drugs have short half-lives in systemic circulation, are easily degraded by proteases in plasma and target cells, are often easily cleared by the reticuloendothelial system and can be immunogenic [4] . New synthetic strategies for limiting metabolism and alternative routes of administration have emerged recently and have resulted in numerous peptide-based drugs that are now being marketed [5] . Nevertheless, new strategies are still urgently needed to solve problems such as nonspecific targeting, poor uptake, low effective biological activity and bioavailability.",

            "text": "As a family of peptide drugs, antiviral peptides have attracted much attention, and some of these molecules have displayed effective bioactivities. A series of synthetic antiviral peptides have been reported. For example, T-20, a 36-mer peptide derived from the HIV-1 transmembrane glycoprotein (gp41), showed potent inhibition of HIV-1 membrane fusion and virus entry and is now in clinical use in HIV-1-infected patients [6] . Despite the therapeutic potency of T-20, resistant strains have emerged. To achieve fusion inhibition without this setback, a similar peptide (T-1249) was designed and synthesized. The peptide T-1249 was more effective than T-20 even with a single daily administration instead of the two administrations used for T-20 and retained activity against most T-20-resistant strains [7, 8] . Another synthetically derived peptide, C5A, prevented HCV infection by inactivating both extra-and intracellular infectious particles. As a potent anti-HCV peptide, C5A destabilizes the viral membrane based on its lipid composition, offering a unique therapeutic approach to HCV and other types of viral infection [9] . However, improving C5A for clinical use would be challenging. These antiviral peptides still face problems such as drug resistance and bioavailability.",

These small peptides are multifunctional as effectors of innate immunity on the skin and mucosal surfaces and have demonstrated direct antimicrobial activity against various bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites [14] . Natural AMPs from scorpion venoms have attracted much attention due to their antiviral bioactivities. The mutational peptide mucroporin-M1 was shown to be virucidal against the measles, SARSeCoV and influenza H5N1 viruses [15] , and inhibited HBV replication in vitro and in vivo [16] .

Since the addition of histidine residues can enhance the helicity, amphiphilicity and endosomal escape of peptides, we try to design histidine-rich peptides from the template of Ctry2459 to improve antiviral activities, cellular uptake and intracellular distribution. The helicity and amphiphilicity of peptides were characterized by circular dichroism (CD). The antiviral activities were studied using real-time RT-QPCR. Confocal microscopy assay was used to investigate the bioavailability. The potential biotoxicity of peptides was characterized by measuring their cytotoxic effect on various cell lines and hemolytic effect on human red blood cells.

By contrast, Ctry2459 was much less inhibitory when added to the cells together with the virus and entirely noninhibitory when added to the cells for 2 h and removed before the virus was added, as well as noninhibitory when added to the cells 4 h after infection. These results suggest that the peptide Ctry2459 only prevented initiation of HCV infection and had no intracellular anti-HCV activity. We speculated that there were some barriers in the infected cells that restricted the action of the peptide Ctry2459. To identify the exact barriers, the cellular localization of Ctry2459 was determined by confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3C , labeled Ctry2459 peptide slightly entered the cells and accumulated in granular structures in the cytoplasm.

The inhibitory activities of Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 against HCV infection both occurred in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 6C and D) . Additionally, the 50% effective (EC 50 ) concentrations were 1.08 mg/ml and 0.85 mg/ml, respectively. To determine whether Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 were virucidal for HCV, the viral supernatant was pretreated with peptide for 2 h, and the HCV RNA content and infectivity were measured. Unlike wild-type Ctry2459, Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 reduced the viral RNA by 40% and 70%, respectively, although the viral infectivities were both reduced by 90%, similar to that of the Ctry2459 peptide. These data suggest that the addition of histidine residues did not affect the mode of peptide action but significantly enhanced the disruption of viral integrity.",

Specifically, the peptides formed granular structures in the cytoplasm instead of being dispersed and equally distributed. These results demonstrated that the efficient action of such peptides requires acidification of the endosomes, further confirming the endosomal escape pathway of Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3. The cytotoxic activities of Ctry2459 and mutational peptides against Huh7.5.1 and L02 cells were tested using the MTT assay ( Fig. 9A and B) , and hemolysis activities were also tested (Fig. 9C) . The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) and the 50% hemolysis concentration (HC 50 ) were calculated. As shown in Table 2 , the CC 50 of Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 against Huh7.5.1 cells were both >500 mg/ml, which was more than 6-fold higher than the CC 50 of Ctry2459.

These results indicated not only that the anti-HCV activities were improved by the addition of histidine residues but also that the cytotoxic and hemolysis activities were significantly reduced. Although we do not understand the principle of toxicity improvement in detail, the designed histidine-rich peptides exhibited optimizing properties as peptide drugs, including bioavailability and toxicity (Fig. 10 ).",

Based on the structure consistency, Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 exhibited more effective virucidal activities in vitro than that of Ctry2459 by displaying stronger disruption of the viral integrity (Fig. 6) . The cellular uptake of Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 significantly increased, and their intracellular distributions were completely different from the intracellular distribution of Ctry2459. In particular, Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 exhibited dispersed distribution in the cytoplasm, indicating the property of endosomal escape. When used as treatments for established HCV infection, Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 exhibited a slightly inhibitory effect when added 4 h postinfection, much less inhibition when added 24 h postinfection but stronger inhibition when added 48 h postinfection. The cause may be that at the early state of infection, there were very few mature viral particles in the cytoplasm so that the virucidal effect could not be significantly reflected. However, HCV replicated to high levels 24 he48 h postinfection, and intracellular mature viral particles rapidly accumulated [31] . Therefore, the mutational peptides Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 effectively enter the cells, break through the endosomes, interact with the mature viral particles, and exhibit significant antiviral activities. The mechanism of enhancement of cellular uptake most likely involves the addition of histidine residues, which enhance modification with stearic acid and increase fusion with the endosomal membrane because of the high membrane affinity of stearic acid [23] . The mechanisms of endosomal escape mostly include the interaction of the peptide with the endosomal membrane and the proton sponge effect: (i) Interaction with the endosomal membrane. The histidine residues are uncharged at neutral pH; however, when the pH of the endosomal lumen drops, the imidazole rings become protonated and can adopt an in-plane orientation at the membrane surface that induces membrane disorder. Hence, pH-induced changes in the peptide charge during endosomal acidification enhance the ability of the escape from the endosome and the ability to reach the cell cytosol and/or, eventually, the nucleus [25, 32] . (ii) Proton sponge effect. Protonation induces an extensive inflow of ions and water into the endosomal environment that subsequently leads to osmotic swelling, endosome rupture and release of the entrapped components [33] .",

To determine the rationality of the action mode, 150 nM bafilomycin A1 was used in the confocal analysis of Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3. After inhibition of the acidification of endosomes, the peptides accumulated in granular structures (particularly Ctry2459-H2) in the cytoplasm, similar to Ctry2459, as shown in Fig. 8 . This result suggests that Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 interact with the intracellular viral particles via the endosomal escape pathway.",

Moreover, the hemolytic activities were also reduced by 1.5fold and 3-fold, respectively. This reduction was most likely related to the net charge of the peptides. At neutral pH, the net charge of peptide Ctry2459 is \u00fe1, whereas Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 are uncharged. The positive charge may enhance the interaction between the peptide and plasma membrane, causing a higher disruption of the plasma membrane. Thus, uncharged Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 exhibit lower cytotoxic and hemolytic activities. However, the specific mechanism of the reduced pharmacological toxicity is not fully understood. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism, and more optimized peptides could be designed and tested on multiple viruses.",

The addition of lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine and Ca 2\u00fe significantly improves the cellular uptake and intracellular distribution of Ctry2459, thus promoting the antiviral activity against established HCV infection. Therefore, we designed two histidine-rich peptides to overcome the cellular uptake and endosome barriers. The designed Fig. 10 . Schematic diagram illustrating a mechanism of the histidine-rich peptide action via the cellular uptake and endosomal escape pathways. The peptides were taken up by the cells via endocytosis and were restricted in endosomes. With the acidification of endosomes by H \u00fe -ATPase, common peptides would be digested by the enzyme, whereas Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3 with endosomal escape properties can easily break through the endosomal barrier. The released peptides in the cytoplasm would be targeted to intracellular HCV particles and act as an antiviral compound.",

The peptideevirus mixture was then removed, and then the cells were washed three times and replenished with growth medium without peptide.
