Of particular concern and urgency for global health is the fact that the majority of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs)-diseases caused by previously undescribed pathogens, or by known pathogens that have recently expanded their host and/or geographic range-are of wildlife origin. 1,2 As human population growth and environmental change bring people into contact with wildlife in unprecedented ways and increasing frequency, pathogens carried by wildlife are \"spilling over\" into domestic animal and human populations. 3 Commonly, these events are occurring in places where a lack of diagnostic testing facilities and planning and infrastructure for outbreak control means that by the time a wildlife zoonotic EID event is recognized, opportunities for effective control measures have passed, resulting in devastating loss of life ( Fig. 19.1) .",

Viruses, especially RNA viruses, are of greatest of concern, because of their ability to rapidly evolve to gain virulence and adapt to new hosts. 4 Ecologically, certain wildlife taxa are of more concern than others. For example, because bats are an ancient vertebrate from wildlife sources that would inform capacity-building for EID mitigation, control, and prevention. Led by the University of California, Davis, One Health Institute (in the School of Veterinary Medicine), PREDICT was initially implemented in 20 countries in Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Latin America by a consortium of organizations including EcoHealth Alliance, Metabiota, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Wildlife Conservation Society ( Fig.  19 .2). PREDICT's objectives were to: (1) conduct wildlife surveillance and virus discovery in EID \"hotspots\" characterized by high wildlife diversity and increasing human pressure on natural resources; (2) characterize high-risk human-animal interfaces, behaviors, and drivers of pathogen spillover from wildlife to people; (3) improve virus detection and discovery by developing laboratory and disease outbreak response capacities; (4) optimize predictive models for zoonotic disease emergence and spread; and (5) deploy cutting-edge information management and communication tools to advance a more integrated, global approach to sharing data from zoonotic virus surveillance. As well, the PREDICT Consortium was wholly committed to limiting potential harm to wildlife populations by implementing live-capture protocols only and by expressing a conservation ethic in all activities, especially communications with stakeholders. For example, when discussing bats as hosts of potential zoonoses, PREDICT teams always coupled these messages with an explanation of the importance of bats to ecosystems, agriculture, and biodiversity. Also, in order to discourage bat depopulation, messages emphasized that killing bats would likely result in increased risk for viral transmission due to dispersal of disturbed populations and increases in reproductive rates to compensate for mortality. live in markets for human consumption. This unfortunately triggered large-scale extermination of civets in a misguided attempt to curb the outbreak, as it was later determined that SARS-like coronaviruses (Co-V) were endemic in wild bats, with civets and humans as spillover hosts. 14",

Expanding upon its substantial investments in building worldwide capacity for avian influenza surveillance and control, USAID launched the Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program in 2009 with the goal of strengthening capacities in developing countries to prevent, detect, and control all emergent wildlife zoonotic diseases (not just avian influenza). The EPT program was designed to be proactive and preemptive in its approach to wildlife zoonoses: to increase our understanding of the ecologic, viral, and behavioral drivers of wildlife virus spillover; train people in biodiversity hotspots around the world to detect and control zoonoses and disease emergence; and build capacity among government ministries for outbreak response and mitigation. 15 Of several core projects that comprised the first 5-year phase of the EPT (2009-2014), PREDICT's mandate was to build the evidence base for zoonotic disease emergence role in zoonotic disease emergence. 16 Wild animals were live-caught with traps, nets, or remote immobilization techniques, according to established protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for safe and humane capture, and were released post sampling. Standard morphometric measurements and photographs were obtained to aid species identification. Whole blood, mucosal (oral, nasal, rectal, genital) swabs, feces, and urine (when feasible) were collected from each animal, placed in a variety of media (lysis buffer, viral transport media), and then transferred within hours to \u221280\u00b0C freezers or liquid nitrogen dewars for safe storage until testing. PREDICT also developed and utilized techniques for noninvasive sampling of wildlife for application in circumstances that made safe capture of wildlife difficult or impossible. 17 At these sites, qualitative data were collected on the nature and extent of these human-wildlife interactions, and on the presence of domestic animals, water sources, etc.",

            "text": "While most large-scale animal disease surveillance programs have targeted known or expected pathogens and have been conducted in areas of known disease occurrence, PREDICT's approach had to achieve the early detection of unknown yet potentially emergent viruses. Therefore, a risk-based approach to viral surveillance was utilized. PREDICT country-based teams worked with governmental and nongovernmental partners to identify sites where human activities were resulting in a high level of contact between wildlife and people. Sampling also took place at sites where there were extensive anthropogenic impacts on habitats and landscapes (e.g., not in pristine habitats) adjacent to human communities deemed vulnerable to zoonoses due to a lack of infrastructure for quality food storage, safe hygiene, or accessible health care. Field personnel then conducted sampling specifically at these high-risk human-wildlife interfaces and focused their sampling on the specific taxa-primates, rodents, and bats-for which there was a preponderance of scientific evidence for their Among hundreds of viral discoveries, many have implications as potential sources of pandemics of wildlife origin. For example, PREDICT effectively doubled the known number of viruses in the family Coronaviridae that includes SARS and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (see Chapter 42). Novel retroviruses and paramyxoviruses were also detected, including the detection of novel henipaviruses (the same viral family that contains Nipah and Hendra viruses) and filovirus exposure in bats. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] As well, PREDICT researchers found strong evidence for western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) as the nonhuman primate reservoir for Human T-lymphotropic virus in western Africa, and discovered a new simian immunodeficiency virus strain in a naturally infected chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) with AIDS-like symptoms. 25, 26 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was found to be circulating among gorillas and chimpanzees and among subspecies of chimpanzees, refuting the previously held assumption that HBV genotypes are host-specific, with implications for the potential for spillover in this group of viruses. 27 Furthermore, PREDICT documented anthropozoonoses-human to primate transmission of viruses-including a human metapneumovirus that caused fatal respiratory disease in wild mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) and human herpes simplex-1 virus that caused classic stomatitis in confiscated eastern lowland gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri). 28, 29 New Models for Emergence PREDICT built upon the original \"hotspots\" model to further assess patterns of wildlife disease emergence in time and space, confirming that the risk of EIDs is highest in areas of high mammalian biodiversity, and finding that mammal diversity, land use type, and land use change are the most important factors for predicting wildlife EIDs. 3, 30 As well, PREDICT searched all published data available through 2010 to identify animal hosts, human activities, and high-risk disease transmission interfaces implicated in zoonotic virus spillover. Network analyses were used to examine these data for transmission pathways, viral traits, host species characteristics, taxonomic ranges, and geographic distributions of zoonotic viruses, to provide fresh insight on the virus characteristics and conditions that pose a risk for future wildlife EIDs. 16 ",
