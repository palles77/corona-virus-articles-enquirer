In that article the variotis aspects of the disease from etiologic, pathogenetic and immunological points of view, were considered as well as for each viral infection the respective clinical-induced condition was also reported. Rotavirus infection was chosen for a detailed study because of its high frequency in the newborn and the consequent need to obtain useful data which eventually would lead to the preparation of a vaccine to be used for the prevention of the disease.",

The isolates were obtained in cultures of an established cell line of fetal Rhesus monkey kidney (MA-104) inoculated with fecal specimens collected from the diarrheic animals. The isolates produced cytopathic effects (CPE) consisting of loci of rounded cells which tended to aggregate linearly and containing cytoplasmatic inclusions of different sizes and shapes. The replication of the virus and the production of the CPE appeared to be strictly dependent on the presence of the trypsin (5 #g/ml) in the culture medium. On the other hand the attempts to grow the isolates on bovine embryo kidney (BEK) cell cultures, with or without trypsin, were unsuccessful.",

Each of the animals of group 4 was given culture medium and served as virus control. One hour later the calves were challenge exposed.

The results of the experimental infection and cross immunity tests are presented in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. The findings from experimental infection can be summarized as follows: after 2-4 days of incubation, all animals became anorexic and depressed and most had a febrile reaction. All had diarrhea, 2-4 days after infection and voided yellowish, fluid feces sometimes containing mucous and/or blood. Most of the calves had sunken eyes and were markedly dehydrated. Symptoms were most severe in calves infected with 81/36F isolate. One calf in this group died on PID 28; this calf had profuse diarrhea for 25 days and it was particularly emaciated when it died. At necropsy its small intestines were thin-walled and the mucosa was generally congested. A second calf from the same group was killed on PID 9, having experienced extremely severe diarrhea and high fever. The lesions in this calf were limited to the ileum and were characterized by thickening of the mucosa. An additional calf, inoculated with 81/40F isolate, was killed on PID 3. When killed it was extremely depressed, febrile and had profuse diarrhea. At necropsy the mucosa of the small intestines appeared markedly congested. The surviving calves had diarrhea for a maximum of 7-10 days, then their general condition improved progressively, reaching complete recovery in approx. 2 weeks.",

By contrast, rotavirus was isolated from 11 of the 27 fecal swabbings that were collected from the control calves. The results of this study seem to strengthen both the opinion that the rotaviruses have an important etiological role in the neonatal diarrhea of calves, and the suggestion that passive immunity would represent a logical way to prevent the disease [27, 30] . As far as the latter aspect is concerned, the aim might be attained by the way indicated in these tests and also suggested by others [27, 28, 30] , i.e. (a) vaccination of the dams with an inactivated vaccine and, (b) feeding newborn calves throughout the period of greatest risk (the first 7-10 days of their life) with colostrum of their dams as part of the diet.",

Despite having isolated strains of rotavirus and demonstrating their capacity to cause disease, their work was largely ignored.

Moreover when these 4 isolates were compared by cross serum neutralisation tests it was found the simian SA-11 and porcine strain ED were indistinguishable and both appeared to relate identically to bovine strain 81/36F.
