            "text": "Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) belongs to a new group of positive-strand RNA viruses, presently classified as genus Arterivirus [3] , which also includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [22, 23] . Expression of the viral genomes of 12-15 kb in infected cells is via the formation of 3'coterminal nested sets of 6 or 7 subgenomic mRNAs. The major structural proteins of these viruses are translated from subgenomic mRNAs 5, 6, and 7. The 5' three-quarters of the viral genome encodes two large proteins, la (1727-2396 amino acids) and lb (1410-1448 amino acids) which are translated from genomic RNA. The ORF lb protein is expressed via a frameshift mechanism involving a slippery sequence and a pseudoknot [8] . The ORF lb proteins of these viruses possess several common functional motifs, i.e. replicase, helicase, and zinc finger motifs, and probably represent the RNA replicases of these viruses. The ORF la protein of EAV possesses an N-terminal papain-like cysteine proteinase (PCP) that autocatalytically cleaves off the N-terminal 29-kDa end of the protein; (nonstructural protein-l; nsp-1) downstream of the catalytic PCP residues [26] . The ORF la proteins of LDV and PRRSV possess two PCPs. Both are functionally active in cleaving off N-terminal products of about 21 (nsp-la) and about 26kDa (nsp-l[3), respectively [7] (see Fig. 1 ). In the case of EAV, a 61 kDa product (nsp-2) is then removed by another cysteine proteinase CP [7] . In addition, the ORF la proteins of these viruses possess a serine proteinase (SP) motif in the C-terminal half of the molecule (see Fig. 1 ), and the SP has been suggested to be responsible for the further cleavage of the protein into functional units [7, 26] .",

            "text": "The function of the ORF la proteins is unknown. However, hydrophobic moment analyses of the ORF la proteins of LDV, EAV, and PRRSV have identified similar 11 or 12 potential transmembrane segments in their C-terminal segments of about 1200 amino acids [20] which flank the SP motif, 4 to 7 segments on either side (see Fig. 1 ). The predicted structure is unique among virus-encoded proteins and implies some specific function of the ORF la proteins in arterivirus replication. The only other proteins with 11 or more transmembrane segments are membrane-associated transport proteins [2, 6, 15, 19] . In the present study we provide strong evidence that the segment of LDV ORF la protein with transmembrane segments 5-11 (see Fig. 1 ) becomes intimately associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes during synthesis and that none of its potential N-glycosylation sites becomes glycosylated. Our approach has been to in vitro translate mRNAs representing portions ofLDV ORF la in the absence and presence of microsomal membranes and then to examine the membrane association of the protein products and their susceptibility to degradation by proteinases. At the same time we have examined the efficiency of termination of the ORF la protein and of frameshift/readthrough at the slippery sequence at the end of LDV-P ORF la (6763GCU UUA AAC UGUUGA... ; slippery sequence and ORF la termination codon are underlined; [20] ).",

The DNAs of pBSK-A69, pBSK\u00f7181-3 and pC4.6 were linearized and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerases or with T3 RNA polymerase in the case of pBSK-A69 as described previously [11] . The integrity of the RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (see later, Fig. 3A ). The transcribed RNAs were in vitro translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in the absence and presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes as also described previously [10, 11] . For investigating their association with microsomal membranes, the products of translation were incubated and centrifuged under different buffer conditions 1-5, 13, 21] . The translation reaction mixtures were diluted about t00-fold with Tris-buffered sucrose (250raM sucrose, 25 mM Tris-HCt, pH 7.5) or 100mM sodium carbonate, pH 11.5. The mixtures were incubated on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged for 1 h at about 100 000 x g at 4 \u00b0C. When incubated in isotonic sucrose buffer, the microsomal membranes remain closed vesicles and all proteins associated with the membrane and those located within the vesicles will be located in the membrane pellet (P), whereas proteins synthesized on free ribosomes will be recovered in the supernatant (S). In contrast, when translation products are incubated in 100mM Na\u00f7-carbonate at pH 11.5, the membrane vesicles are disrupted and only integral membrane proteins remain associated with the pelleted membranes, whereas secreted glycoproteins and peripheral proteins are recovered in the supernatant [13] . After centrifugation, the proteins in the supernatant (S) were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and air dried. The pelleted material (P) was washed once in sterile water. The S and P proteins were suspended in reducing sample buffer and analyzed by tricine sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) [25] using 16.5%T: 3%C or 12.5%T: 3%C gels (T refers to total percentage of acrylamide and bisacrylamide monomers and C refers to the percentage of crosslinker relative to T [ 17] ) as described previously [11] .",

The main product of the A69 transcript whether translated in the absence or presence of microsomat membranes was a protein of about 2022 kDa ( Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 4) . However, the presence of membranes enhanced translation of the A69 transcript and the product was almost exclusively recovered in the membrane pellet and thus associated with membranes, whereas the protein synthesized in the absence of membranes was mainly recovered in the S fraction. Incubation in carbonate buffer, pH 11.5, did not cause a significant release of the protein from the membranes (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 5) . Thus the protein product became integrated into the membranes during membrane-associated synthesis. Translation must have been initiated at one of the three AUG codons of ORF la located close together at the 5' end of the transcript, but which one is not clear. None of the three AUGs are in favorable context for translation [18] with C rather than a purine at the -3 position, relative to the A(+ 1) of the AUG codon but the same is the case for the initiation codons of most of ORFs 2-7 which function efficiently and specifically in translation initiation [11] . The termination codon was provided by the vector so that the six terminal amino acids in the protein product were derived from vector sequences. Initiation at one of the three AUG codons would yield proteins with 246, 234 or 205 amino acids, respectively. Another minor product of about 45-kDa was consistently produced from the A69 transcript with properties similar to those of the about 22-kDa protein. Its nature is unknown.",

As also predicted by the hydrophobic moment analyses (Fig. i) , the pC4.6 product did not become membrane-associated. A transcript of pC4.6 could potentially yield two protein products if a frame-shift occurred at the slippery sequence at nt 6765-6771 (see earlier and Fig. 1 ). One protein would be composed of 321 amino acids (35.2 kDa), 4 Nterminal amino acids encoded by the vector plus the 317 amino acid long C-terminal end of the ORF la protein. The second protein would possess an additional 80 amino acids (about 10 kDa), 76 representing the N-terminal end of the ORF lb protein plus C-terminal 4 amino acids encoded by the vector. Both products were generated. Since the 44 kDa product possessed twice as many Met residues as the 35 kDa protein, namely six, the level of radioactivity in the two proteins indicates that the read-through product was synthesized in considerably lower amounts than the terminated ORF la protein ( Fig. 2A, lane 9 ). Since significant amounts of a 10 kDa protein were not produced, little, if any, cleavage of the 10 kDa ORF lb protein segment from the 44 kDa read-through product occurred. The presence of membranes had no significant effect on the translation of the pC4.6 transcript and the products were recovered in the soluble supernatant fraction whether synthesized in the presence or absence of membranes ( Fig. 2A, lanes 9-12) .",

The same products were generated by proteinase digestion after incubation of the primary product in carbonate buffer, pH 11.5 (Fig. 4B) . The lower recovery of some products after the carbonate treatment does not indicate additional protein digestion since a variable loss was also frequently observed with non-proteinase-treated proteins after carbonate, pH 11.5, treatment, apparently resulting from sticking of the proteins to test tube walls [1 iI. The smallest proteinase digestion products varied in size depending on the proteinase used (Fig. 4) ; it was the smallest after proteinase K digestion.",

This might be followed by the autocatalytic release of another protein (nsp-2) by the action of cysteine protease [7] . One of the putative transmembrane segments then could function as a processed or uncleaved signal peptide so that the synthesis of the remainder of the ORF la protein occurs on membrane vesicles, however, in a manner that prevents N-glycosylation. In contrast, all the N-glycosylation sites in the ectodomains of the ORF 2 and ORF 5 glycoproteins become glycosylated during membrane-associated in vitro synthesis and the oligosaccharide chains seem to become processed during traverse through Golgi membranes in vivo [11, 12] .",

However, the integration of at least a large portion of the protein into ER membranes suggests one possibility, namely that this process results in the formation of unique double-membrane vesicles that are invariably associated with the replication of all arteriviruses regardless of the nature of the host cell [23, 27, 28] . Electron micrographs suggest that these double membrane vesicles originate from rough ER by protrusion and detachment [28] . Their formation is a very early event in LDV replication in macrophages and free nucleocapsids first appear among these vesicles before budding into single-membrane cisternae located generally next to Golgi membranes [23, 27] . These findings combined with the uniqueness of these structures suggests that these double membrane vesicles may play an important role in virus replication. The possibility that comes to mind is a role in the synthesis of viral genomic and subgenomic lnRNAs since viral RNA synthesis in general seems to be membrane associated. The function of membranes and their associated proteins in viral nucleic acid synthesis is not known, but they might supply some organizational component to the replication complex and/or facilitate RNA folding as suggested for RNA chaperones [16] . In the case of the arteriviruses, the ORF lb replicase protein is not an integraI membrane protein and probably supplies the catalytic RNA replicase functions since it possesses helicase, replicase, and zinc binding motifs [22] . Our results as well as those for EAV [8] suggest that the ORF lb protein is synthesized in much smaller amounts than the ORF la protein which is typical for ribosomal frame shifting [1] . Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ORF la and lb proteins provide structural and catalytic functions, respectively.",
