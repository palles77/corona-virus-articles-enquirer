Serum protein electrophoresis and the concentration of haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), a 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP), IgG and IgM were evaluated in cats exposed to feline coronavirus (FCoV) and in cats with FIP. The highest concentration of APPs was detected in affected cats, confirming the role of these proteins in supporting a clinical diagnosis of FIP. Repeated samplings from both FIP affected and FCoV-exposed cats showed that when FIP appeared in the group, all the cats had increased APP levels. This increase persisted only in cats that developed FIP (in spite of a decrease in a 2globulins) but it was only transient in FCoV-exposed cats, in which a long lasting increase in a 2 -globulins was observed. These results suggest that changes in the electrophoretic motility of APPs or APPs other than Hp, SAA and AGP might be involved in the pathogenesis of FIP or in protecting cats from the disease.",

In contrast, the percentage of seropositivity was higher in cats that developed the disease, in agreement with previous findings (Pedersen, 1995) .",

Compared to controls, cats with FIP shared the typical electrophoretic changes (Sparkes et al., 1991) , and increased APP levels. In particular, a 10-fold increase of SAA was detectable, thus confirming its role as an APP in cats (Kajikawa et al., 1999) . Although no cats with diseases other than FIP were included in this study, the high SAA concentration detected in sick cats suggests that this protein might also be a marker of FIP, as has been reported for Hp and AGP (Duthie et al., 1997; Stoddart et al., 1988) . It is interesting to note that the APPs were particularly high at T 0 in cat No. 51, suggesting that an inflammatory reaction was already occurring before the appearance of the symptoms (Kajikawa et al., 1999) . Furthermore, cats with FIP had high IgG levels, most likely due to antibody production, Fig. 3 . a 1 -Acid glycoprotein concentrations (mg/mL) in the four samples FCoV-exposed cats. but low IgM concentrations probably reflecting the fact that most of the cats were at an advanced stage of disease: in fact, b-globulins, where IgM migrate, increase only in cases of FIP with recent lesions (Paltrinieri et al., 2001) . Unfortunately it was not possible to repeat the sampling in the two cats with FIP which were not euthanasized after the diagnosis. The behaviour of bglobulins and of APPs was different in the two cats probably depending on the different clinical forms or on the different times of sampling: in experimentally induced FIP, Hp decreases during the first 20 days postinfection, then increases (Stoddart et al., 1988) .",

Non-Ig proteins with c-motility have been already reported (Paltrinieri et al., 1998) . Although APPs with b-motility (e.g., transferrin or CRP) might account for the increase of b-globulins recorded in FCoV-exposed cats, one could speculate that the electrophoretic motility of some APPs might change during FIP, as occurs in humans, maybe due to changes in their glycosylation pattern (Mackiewicz and Mackiewicz, 1995; Ducret et al., 1996) . This hypothesis is supported by the finding that AGP concentration was often higher than the total amount of a 1 -globulins, where AGP should migrate. Moreover the decrease of a 2 -globulins, observed in both the cats with FIP during the course of the disease, is not due to a quantitatively similar decrease of APPs. SAA concentration was too low (lg/mL) to influence the total a 2globulin concentration, but changes of Hp levels should induce changes in the corresponding electrophoretic band. In contrast, the decrease of a 2 -globulins in cats with FIP was higher than that of Hp, probably due to the decrease of some other ''negative APP'' (Kaneko, 1997) or to changes of electrophoretic motility of APPs. The behaviour of a 2 -globulins needs to be further investigated because it might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease. This fraction decreased during FIP, but slightly increased in FCoV-exposed cats.",
