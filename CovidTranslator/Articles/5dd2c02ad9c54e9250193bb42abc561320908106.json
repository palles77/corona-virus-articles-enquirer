This sharp demarcation is even seen in situations where CNS axons are not myelinated, such as the myelin-deficient rat and the jimpy mouse. 22 A similar demarcation is also seen in rare situations close to the root transition zone where \"islands\" Schwann cells are occasionally found myelinating CNS axons or where \"islands\" of central glial cells occur in nerve roots in normal animals, 24 where Schwann cells are occasionally found myelinating CNS axons in normal animals,18,37,44 and more extensively in mutants such as the Browman-Wyse rat.2 Thus, in situations where there has been no pathological alteration to astrocytes there is a sharp transition from Schwann cell to central glia ensheathment of axons. The central glia ensheathment may be by astrocytes alone, or by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Intermixing of oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell myelination of axons is never seen in normal animals.",

This failure of astrocytes to maintain the integrity of the CNS environment allows Schwann cells to enter the CNS and myelinate axons. It is useful to compare the X-irradiation situation to the myelin-deficient rat. In the MD rat there is a similar failure of myelination. due to degeneration of myelinating oligodendrocytes. However, in contrast to the X-irradiated neonatal cord, there is no compromise to the astrocytes. This means that the glia limitans remains intact throughout development, and hence there is no Schwann cell invasion (Fig. 1) . The importance of the intact glia limitans in preventing this invasion is best illustrated by the observation that Schwann cells will myelinate CNS axons following X-irradiation of the spinal cord of MD rat neonatesz2 The demyelinated axons therefore reside in an environment which, in terms of the glial population, is neither CNS nor PNS. If such a lesion is created in X-irradiated white matter, this situation presists indefinitely, and thus provides a useful 'test-bed' in which to examine how transplanted glia interact with demyelinated axons. ii-Ethidium bromide lesions created in normal, non-irradiated white matter undergo spontaneous repair. The nature of this repair process reveals the mutual exclusion between PNS and CNS glia that is the key to understanding the behaviour of Schwann cells within the CNS. The demyelinated axons are remyelinated by either Schwann ceils or oligodendrocytes.",

Schwann cell myelination of CNS axons is frequently seen following naturally occurring and experimentally induced spinal cord trauma. 16,32.34 The axons of retinal ganglion cells of the rat are normally not myelinated. However, following trauma to the retina and choroid, Schwann cell myelination of these axons can be observed and it is of particular interest that the extent of Schwann cell myelination is influenced by the animals age.40 There are several possible explanations for this observation: (1) the recruitment signal for attracting Schwann cells is greater in developing animals; (2) Schwann cells become less responsive to these signals with age; or (3) the ability of astrocytes to exclude Schwann cells increases with age. When Schwann cells are found myelinating axons in the retina in this and other situations, the areas of myelination are restricted, indicating that factors other than the presence of axons available for myelination play a significant role in controlling Schwann cell myelination of CNS axons.",

The manner in which Schwann cells migrate within a glia-free area of drmyelination becomes apparent when Schwann cells arc transplanted into the sub-arachnoid space above an X-irradiated ethidium bromide lesion.x i-Schwann cells enter the lesion along blood vessels (BV), using the perivascular extracellular matrix as a substrate. This same matrix enables the Schwann cells to remyelinate those demyelinated axons immediately adjacent to the blood vessel. Subsequently, remyelination proceeds in a stepwise manner away from the blood vessel. migrating Schwann cells using the basal lamina around established myelinating Schwann cells to reach an available length of demyelinated axon and then invest it with a new myelin sheath. ii-The absence of an cxtracellular matrix within glia-free areas of dtmydination means that Schwann cells are unable to migrate through areas containing only d~myeIinated axons. iii-The absence of extensive Schwann cell remyelination at the edges of the lesion indicate that the extracellular matrix associated with astrocyte surfaces is a minor route of entry into the lesion from the subarachnoid space compared with the blood vessel route.

If, however, the experiments are undertaken in the cat and the transplantation is carried out 14 days after induction of demyelination, the larger size of the lesion together with the absence of inflammatory responses associated with the intraspinal injection, means that the routes by which this migration takes place can be more readily appreciated* (Fig. 3) . In this situation, the restriction of Schwann cell myelination to the perivascular region is striking. When such perivascular clumps of Schwann cells are examined in detail it can be seen that myelination is most advanced adjacent to the blood vessel, with earlier stages of remyelination (engagement, engulfment, spiralling etc) occurring at increasing distances away from the blood vessel. This pattern of remyelination indicates that the perivascular space represents an important avenue of migration for Schwann cells into the CNS, a conclusion supported by a number of other studies. 22,41 Moreover, it also provides information on the manner in which Schwann cells move away from the blood vessel into areas of the lesion containing demyelinated axons. These areas contain no glial cells and the Schwann cells move through the axon environment in a stepwise fashion, engaging demyelinated axons only where they can maintain contact with an established Schwann cell. There was no evidence that Schwann cells could migrate along demyelinated axons which lay in an environment that was both glia-free and devoid of extracellular matrix. Thus, movement of Schwann cells through an environment consisting solely of demyelinated axons is very much more cautious than that through collagen containing areas where one observes multiple Schwann cells interacting with single axons so that remyelination of a lesion proceeds rapidly. These irz vivo observations are entirely consistent with those made 111 vitro, where it was observed that Schwann cells would not myelinate along suspended fascicles 01 neurites, but were able to do so if they could maintain contact with a collagen-coated surface.'7 In vivo the surface may be provided by extracellular matrix or cells, in particular those coated in basal lamina. A further important point to arise from these studies is that Schwann cells respond to a diffusible chemotactic signal, indicated by the migration of Schwann cells from a remote source in response to a lesion containing demyelinated axons. These signals have yet to be identified but the demyelinated axon itself seems a probable source. An appreciation of how the Schwann cells' dependence on contact with a stable extracellular matrix17 will affect the cells behaviour in the CNS is readily appreciated following the injection of Schwann cells into glia-free areas of demyelination in the cat\" (Fig. 4) . When cells are injected into such a lesion they will come to rest next to demyelinated axons in association with one of three structures:",

            "text": "Some years ago a series of transplantation studies were undertaken to formally test the hypothesis that astrocytes restrict Schwann cell access to CNS axons. These studies made use of the both the non-X-irradiated and X-irradiated ethidium bromide lesion in the rat spinal cord. Central to understanding these experiments are two observations. Firstly, the normalethidium bromide lesion is mainly repaired by Schwann cells, with oligodendrocyte remyelination limited to astrocyte containing areas around the edges of the lesion next to normal white matter.\"' Secondly, all glial cell cultures prepared from the CNS are contaminated by Schwann cells. This point was first established when cultures. ostensibly of CNS glia. were transplanted into non-repairing X-irradiated ethidium bromide lesions and resulted in areas of Schwann cell remyelination.\" Careful examination of the cultures revealed the presence of small numbers of Schwann cells (4%). identified as cells co-expressing S 100 and laminin or L 1. Unless specific steps are taken to remove these cells. they have been identified in all subsequently prepared cultures of CNS glia. Thus, following transplantation into the non-irradiated lesion, Schwann cells are of both host origin and transplant origin, whereas, in the X-irradiated lesion they are exclusively of transplant origin. The predominantly Schwann cell-repaired ethidium bromide lesion can be changed to one where most remyelination is by oligodendrocytes by transplanting mixed CNS cultures. If the proportion of astrocytes within the transplant is reduced this change does not occur, and the majority of axons are remyelinated by Schwann cells despite the increased number of central myelinating cells. Taken together, these two results indicate that the presence of astrocytes is necessary to prevent extensive Schwann cell remyelination and is consistent with an inhibitory role for astr0cytes.l' Interestingly, the shift towards oligodendrocyte remyelination is not as great if astrocytes alone are transplanted, a result which suggests that the ability of astrocytes to control the invasion of Schwann cells may be related to the availability of oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Following transplantation of a mixed culture, these cells are in abundance. However, following transplantation of astrocytes alone, the host is the only source of oligodendrocyte-linkage cells?5 The interaction between oligodendroc~e-lineage cells and astrocytes in controlling Schwann cell invasion can be investigated further using the X-irradiated ethidium bromide lesion, where the presence of Schwann cells can be confined to the small contaminating population within the transplant. When a mixed population of central glia is transplanted into a non-irradiated lesion, all but a few axons are remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. l1 However, as the proportion of transplanted oligodendrocytes is reduced, a level is reached below which the astrocytes within the transplant are unable to prevent the co-transplanted Schwann cells from becoming the dominant myelinating cell within the lesion. 2o Thus, oligodendrocyte lineage cells are required in order for astrocytes to contain the small population of Schwann cells. When astrocytes are transplanted with a small contaminating population of Schwann cells and no oligodendrocyte lineage cells, the failure of astrocytes to control the Schwann cells again becomes evident. 26 In this latter situation, transplanted astrocytes are confined to small, basal-lamina bound islands or clumps of cells that contain a few axons. The majority of axons remain outside these small islands and are remyelinated by Schwann cells, which presumabIy make use of the basal lamina associated with the astrocyte to migrate and myelinate (Fig. 4iii) .",

When oligodendrocytes are present the two cell types combine to reconstruct an extensive glial environment containing many oligodendrocyte remyelinated axons contained within a glia limitans. Schwann cell remyelination is restricted to those axons that are \"outside\". Thus, the normal relationship between CNS and PNS is re-created by the transplanted cells. In the absence of oligodendrocytes, although a glia limitans is established by transplanted astrocytes most of the demyelinated axons lie \"outside\". What is interesting to note is that when astrocytes are transplanted without Schwann cells, the tendency of astrocytes to aggregate so as to exclude demyelinated axons is not pronounced, suggesting that it is the Schwann cells that induce this behaviour in the transplanted astrocytes.27",

When Schwann cells are injected into the normal CNS, few if any cells can be detected 1 month after transplantation. ',12 Moreover, an astrocytosis is detected around the implantation site that appears to be induced by the Schwann cells.' Thus, when Schwann cells are transplanted into the developing CNS, it appears that the Schwann cells are not merely confined to the area around the point of injection but are actively extruded by astrocytes when they do establish within the substance of the CNS. Attempts to introduce Schwann cells into areas containing large diameter unmyelinated axons and astrocytes, such as occurs in the retina, results in very little Schwann cell remyelination despite there being axons available to be myelinated.lO The same is also true of Schwann cell transplants into the myelin deficient ratz (Fig. 1) . It would therefore appear that not only are Schwann cells unable to gain entry into astrocytic environments in mature animals, but their presence also stimulates an astrocytic response.",

In essence, there is a \"mutual exclusion\" between the two cells types, a phenomenon which can be related to the epithelial properties manifested by both cells. A feature of epithelial cells is their association with a basal lamina along one surface, a feature also exhibited by both axon-associating Schwann cells and astrocytes of both the normal or reconstructed glia limitans. It is a basic principle of development that basal lamina formation separates IIOIIcompatible tissue elements and there is a sharp transition between one type of epithelia) ccl1 and the next when they share the same basal lamina. as occurs for instance in the respiratory and digestive systems. In these latter systems, if one cell type should degenerate, the territory previously occupied by that cell type can be taken over by its neighbour. This process wilt continue until viable epithelium is reached, when the invasion ceases and a new boundary is cstablishcd. It would appear, therefore, that in their interactions astrocytes and Schwann cells manifest all the basic behaviour of epithelial cells. With this appreciation it is possible to predict what would happen if one tried to remyelinate multiple sclerosis plaques by transplanting Schwann cells without first removing the astrocytes which surround the demyelinated axons.

In this mutant. the axons of the PNS, including the nerve roots, are normally myelinated by Schwann cells, but the axons comprising the CNS white matter tracts are unmyelinated due to the premature degeneration of oligodendrocytes.The presence of an intact astrocytic environment around these axons, including the basal lamina-coated glia limitans. prevents these axons from being myelinated by Schwann cells, in spite of their close proximity to the nerve roots. ii-Following transplantation of Schwann cells into the white matter of the myelin-deficient rat, Schwann cell myelination of the axons is limited. Moreover. it is localized to the point of injection where the astrocytes have been damaged by the trauma associated with the injection procedure itselfi-Following injection of ethidium bromide into white matter, a small, focal lesion is created which is devoid of both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.",

For this reason, astrocytes transplanted into lesions together with Schwann cells may promote rapid Schwann cell remyelination of the lesion.26THE BEHAVIOUR OF SCHWANN CELLS PLACED NEAR TO OR INTO AREAS OF GLIA-FREE DEMYELINATION",
