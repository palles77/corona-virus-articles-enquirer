            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) can present with a wide range of symptoms, ranging from a mild clinical syndrome to more severe forms that may need hospitalization and even admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In individuals over 65 years of age, it is one of the major causes of death and the greatest cause of death from infectious disease. 1 The fact that it continues to be a problem is shown by a recent study that reports an increase of up to 8.8% in hospitalizations in recent years, and increased rates of infection caused by enterobacteriaceae. 2 Since the appearance of influenza A and the routine use of molecular detection techniques, more and more evidence is emerging on the role of viruses as etiological and/or concomitant agents in CAP. In general, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus are still the most common, but the highly fatal coronavirus outbreaks in recent years and the zoonosis of the influenza virus suggest that we should be on the alert for these new emerging pathogens. 3 Viral pneumonias have led to other complications such as obesity and pregnancy being added to the list of comorbidities included in risk scales as factors for severity in this type of pneumonia.",

However, evidence suggests an increase in mortality at 30 days and even up to 5 years after CAP, mainly due to heart diseases. Readmission after CAP was also required in up to 18% of cases, either for the same pneumonia or for extrapulmonary (primarily cardiovascular) complications, 4 and reincorporation into activities of daily living was also delayed, particularly in elderly patients. Prognostic scales, then, should perhaps not be limited to evaluating short-term or in-hospital mortality, but instead should be designed to predict other variables that are important in the survival and quality of life of CAP patients.",

Along the same lines, it would be relatively easy to add comorbidities and oxygen saturation to the previously used scales CURB-65 (DS-CURB-65). 5 In conventional scales, age is one of the most weighted variables, and this can distort the score: one way to correct this in subjects over 76 years of age may be to incorporate SOAR (oxygen saturation, age and respiratory rate). This approach has shown greater sensitivity for predicting mortality than the CRB-65, but its specificity is low. In recent years, the possibility of using biomarkers as predictors for mortality has been explored; procalcitonin (PCT) has been one of the most widely studied markers, with a low PCT on admission being associated with low mortality, irrespective of PSI or CRB-65. A great many others, such as PaCO 2 , platelet count, and proadrenomedullin, have also been studied.",
