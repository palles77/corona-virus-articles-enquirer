Laboratory examination identified a novel coronavirus which was tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. The WHO has more recently formally named the 2019-nCoV as coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19). Within one month, the novel coronavirus rapidly spread across the whole of China through droplet transmission and contact transmission, and the reported number of confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrated a rising trend. Radiological examinations, especially computed tomography CT, were confirmed as effective methods for the screening and diagnosis of infected cases. Reports stated that many radiologists and technologists were being infected when examining patients with COVID-19. In order to clarify the imaging features of COVID-19 and reduce the infection risk of medical personnel in radiology departments, we summarized the experience on radiological examinations and infection prevention for COVID-19, aiming to guide virus prevention, diagnosis and control within radiology departments.",

Characteristics, clinical symptoms, diagnosis and reporting of COVID-19 2.1 Etiological and epidemiological characteristics The new coronavirus belongs to the new coronavirus of the genus \u03b2, which has an envelope, the particles are round or oval, often polymorphic, and the diameter is about 60-140nm. Its genetic characteristics are significantly different from both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Current research shows that it has more than 85% homology with bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45). Most understanding of the physical and chemical properties of coronavirus comes from research into SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The virus is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. Kept at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes, lipid solvents such as ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, and chloroform can effectively inactivate the virus. Chlorhexidine, however, cannot effectively inactivate the virus",
