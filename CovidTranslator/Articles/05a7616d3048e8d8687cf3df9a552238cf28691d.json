The 11 ISRCC volunteer participating radiologists (9 in Iran, 1 in Canada, and 1 in the United States) all received subspecialty fellowship training and have 4 to 24 years of experience in thoracic imaging. Based on recent published literature of present outbreak in Wuhan, China, and short supply of test kits in Iran, the following triage strategy was established [2, 4, 8] (Fig. 1) . Patients with early clinical and laboratory findings suspicious for COVID-19 infection should undergo chest CT interpreted by a local general radiologist. CT scans of patients with abnormalities are referred to a teleradiology group as described later. An additional patient triaging algorithm depending on the results of the CT scan with or without rRT-PCR testing is described in Figure 1 .",

Once a study (image files in JPEG format or cine clips in MP4 format) was submitted, the coordinator assigned a case number and posted images to the ISRCC private WhatsApp group. Then, one of the available volunteers generated a report using a standard format as a comment on the post [7] . Access to the private group was strictly limited to the coordinator and volunteer radiologists, who were instructed to access information on their passwordprotected devices to ensure the confidentiality of information. Disagreements on specific cases were resolved by consensus agreement through radiologists' discussions in the same post. Participation of expert radiologists in different time zones allowed efficient time coverage for reviewing submitted images. The coordinator forwarded the final report to the referrer via WhatsApp or e-mail.",

Nonetheless, our priority was to identify the majority of suspicious cases on chest CT and use rRT-PCR testing in a more selective fashion to minimize resource drain. It is imperative that CT findings should be interpreted in the context of positive exposure history and clinical symptoms, especially in epidemic areas with high pretest probability for disease. Although we were able to meet the current need using 11 volunteers, the increased demand for thoracic radiology expertise might exceed the capacity of traditional or even social media-delivered teleradiology services as the volunteers' home countries experience an influx of diagnostic cases and are themselves subject to infection.
