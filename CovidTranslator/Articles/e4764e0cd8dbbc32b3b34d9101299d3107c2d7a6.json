However, low resolution and mass accuracy of SELDI-TOF-MS remain a major obstacle for determination of biological identities of potential protein biomarkers. We report here a refined workflow that combines ZipTip desalting, acetonitrile precipitation, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis for the profiling, purification and identification of the targeted serum proteins found by SELDI-TOF-MS. By using this workflow, we purified ten targeted proteins from the sera of patients with various types of advanced stage (stage III-IV) cancers. These proteins were identified as isoforms of the human serum amyloid protein A (SAA) family with or without truncations at their N-terminals. This was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Different SAA expression patterns were observed by MALDI-TOF-MS profiling. SAA has long been reported as a biomarker for various cancer types such as lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. However, in this study we found increased SAA expression in the sera of advanced-stage cancer patients with different cancer types. Our results suggest that maybe SAA should not be used alone as a biomarker for any specific cancer type.",

With the advantages of simple operation, high-throughput capability, relatively high sensitivity, and the capability of profiling small proteins with molecular weight less than 20 kDa, it has been widely used as a screening tool for clinical samples, and led to potential protein biomarker discovery in many cancer types, including lung can- cer [1] , prostate cancer [2] , ovarian cancer [3] and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia [4] . However, the inherent low resolution and mass accuracy have prevented SELDI-TOF-MS from application in identification of targeted proteins. As a consequence, many reports were limited to a general description of protein peaks, without further elucidation of protein identities and clinical and pathological validation. Therefore, developing novel approaches for the purification and identification of targeted proteins remain a major challenge in SELDI-TOF-MS-based biomarker discovery.",
