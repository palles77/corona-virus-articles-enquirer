            "text": "Back in 1928, Alexander Fleming 1 began the microbial drug era when he discovered in a Petri dish seeded with Staphylococcus aureus that a compound produced by a mold killed the bacteria. The mold, identified as Penicillium notatum, produced an active agent that was named penicillin. Later, penicillin was isolated as a yellow powder and used as a potent antibacterial compound during World War II. By using Fleming's method, other naturally occurring substances, such as chloramphenicol and streptomycin, were isolated. Naturally occurring antibiotics are produced by fermentation, an old technique that can be traced back almost 8000 years, initially for beverages and food production. Beer is one of the world's oldest beverages, produced from barley by fermentation, possibly dating back to the sixth millennium BC and recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Another old fermentation, used to initiate the koji process, was that of rice by Aspergillus oryzae. During the past 4000 years, Penicillium roqueforti has been utilized for cheese production, and for the past 3000 years soy sauce in Asia and bread in Egypt has represented examples of traditional fermentations. 2 Natural products with industrial applications can be produced from primary or secondary metabolism of living organisms (plants, animals or microorganisms). Owing to technical improvements in screening programs, and separation and isolation techniques, the number of natural compounds discovered exceeds 1 million. 3 Among them, 50-60% are produced by plants (alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, carbohydrates, etc.) and 5% have a microbial origin. Of all the reported natural products, approximately 20-25% show biological activity, and of these approximately 10% have been obtained from microbes. Furthermore, from the 22 500 biologically active compounds that have been obtained so far from microbes, 45% are produced by actinomycetes, 38% by fungi and 17% by unicellular bacteria. 3 The increasing role of microorganisms in the production of antibiotics and other drugs for treatment of serious diseases has been dramatic. However, the development of resistance in microbes and tumor cells has become a major problem and requires much research effort to combat it.",

            "text": "It is important to understand that many chemically synthesized drugs owe their origin to natural sources. Applications of chemically synthesized natural metabolites include the use of a natural product derived from plant salicyclic acid derivatives present in white willow, wintergreen and meadowsweet to relieve pain and suffering. Concoctions of these plants were administered by Hippocrates back in the year 500 BC, and even earlier in Egypt and Babylonia, for fever, pain and childbirth. Synthetic salicylates were produced initially by Bayer in 1874, and later in 1897, Arthur Eichengrun at Bayer discovered that an acetyl derivative (aspirin), reduced acidity, bad taste and stomach irritation. These plant-based systems continue to play an essential role in health care, and it has been estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) that approximately 80% of the world's inhabitants rely mainly on traditional medicines for their primary health care. 5 Other synthesized compounds originating from natural products include a nonapeptide, designated teprotide, which was isolated from the venom of the Brazilian pit viper Bothrops jararaca. 6 This led to the design and synthesis of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril, which was the first marketed, orally active ACE inhibitor. 7 Enalapril, another ACE inhibitor used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, was approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1985. 6 The alkaloid quinine, the active constituent of the 'fever tree' Cinchona succirubra, has been known for centuries by South American Indians to control malaria. During the twentieth century, massive programs to synthesize quinoline derivatives, based on the quinine prototype, were carried out. The first of the new quinolones to be used clinically as an antibacterial agent was nalidixic acid, which emerged as part of a large chemical synthesis program developed at the Sterling Winthrop Research Institute. 8, 9 The program was begun when 7-chloro-1,4-dihydro-1-ethyl-4-oxoquinolone-3-carboxylic acid was obtained as a side product during purification of chloroquine and found to have antibacterial activity. The best compound found in the program was nalidixic acid, which had remarkable activity against Gram-negative bacteria and was shown to be an inhibitor of DNA gyrase. Its discovery led to a whole series of synthetic quinolone and fluoroquinolone antibiotics (pefloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, etc.), which have been very successful in medicine and have achieved major commercial success (Table 1) . It is important to appreciate that all quinolones, though synthetic, are based on the structure of the natural plant product quinine.",

            "text": "Secondary metabolites have exerted a major impact on the control of infectious diseases and other medical conditions, and the development of pharmaceutical industry. Their use has contributed to an increase in the average life expectancy in the USA, which increased from 47 years in 1900 to 74 years (in men) and 80 years (in women) in 2000. 11 Probably, the most important use of secondary metabolites has been as anti-infective drugs. In 2000, the market for such antiinfectives was US$55 billion (Table 1 ) and in 2007 it was US$66 billion. Table 1 shows that, among the anti-infective drugs, antivirals represent more than 20% of the market. Two antivirals that are chemically synthesized today were originally isolated from marine organisms. They are acyclovir (active against the herpes virus by inhibition and inactivation of DNA polymerase) and cytarabine (active against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). Both compounds are nucleoside analog drugs, originally isolated from sponges. 12 Other antiviral applications of natural compounds are related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. In the pathogenesis of this disease, HIV-1, similar to other retroviruses, depends on its stable integration into the host genome to facilitate efficient replication of the viral RNA and maintenance of the infected state. Therefore, de novo viral DNA synthesized during reverse transcription is immediately integrated into the host cell DNA (through the integration step), allowing for further transcription of viral RNA. In the late phase of HIV viral replication, the large precursor polyprotein (gag-pol precursor, Pr 160) must be appropriately cleaved by a viral protease. The cleavage of the gag precursor protein of HIV is critical for the maturation and infectivity of the viral particle. Without the appropriate cleavage of the precursor polyproteins, non-infectious viral particles are generally produced. To confront this problem, a tremendous effort has been made at the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), in search of natural metabolites capable of inhibiting HIV reverse transcriptase and HIV protease. Chemically synthesized derivatives of these compounds are the main agents now used against HIV. Furthermore, reports have been published on natural product inhibitors of HIV integrase obtained from among the marine ascidian alkaloids; that is, the lamellarins (produced by the mollusk Lamellaria sp.), and from terrestrial plants (Baccharis genistelloides and Achyrocline satureioides). The most consistent anti-HIV activity was observed with extracts prepared from several Baccharis species. 13 In addition, NCI has been evaluating the HIV-1 inhibitory activity of pepstatin A, a small pentapeptide produced by several Streptomyces species. It contains a unique hydroxyamino acid, statine, that sterically blocks the active site of HIV-1 protease. 14, 15 REASONS FOR DEVELOPING NEW ANTIBIOTICS New antibiotics that are active against resistant bacteria are required. Bacteria have lived on the Earth for several billion years. During this time, they encountered in nature a wide range of naturally occurring antibiotics. To survive, bacteria developed antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Therefore, it is not surprising that they have become resistant to most of the natural antimicrobial agents that have been developed over the past 50 years. 16 This resistance increasingly limits the effectiveness of current antimicrobial drugs. The problem is not just antibiotic resistance but also multidrug resistance. In 2004, more than 70% of pathogenic bacteria were estimated to be resistant to at least one of the currently available antibiotics. 17 The so-called 'superbugs' (organisms that are resistant to most of the clinically used antibiotics) are emerging at a rapid rate. S. aureus, which is resistant to methicillin, is responsible for many cases of infections each year. The incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria is increasing. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) reported in 2004 that in US hospitals alone, around 2 million people acquire bacterial infections each year (http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id\u00bc4682). S. aureus is responsible for half of the hospital-associated infections and takes the lives of approximately 100 000 patients each year in the USA alone. 18 The bacteria produce a biofilm in which they are encased and protected from the environment. Biofilms can grow on wounds, scar tissues and medical implants or devices, such as joint prostheses, spinal instrumentations, catheters, vascular prosthetic grafts and heart valves. More than 70% of the bacterial species producing such biofilms are likely to be resistant to at least one of the drugs commonly used in anti-infectious therapy. 14 called 'nosocomial bacteria.' More than 60% of sepsis cases in hospitals are caused by Gram-negative bacteria. 14 Among them, Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounts for almost 80% of these opportunistic infections. They represent a serious problem in patients hospitalized with cancer, cystic fibrosis and burns, causing death in 50% of cases. Other infections caused by Pseudomonas species include endocarditis, pneumonia and infections of the urinary tract, central nervous system, wounds, eyes, ears, skin and musculoskeletal system. This bacterium is another example of a natural multidrug-resistant microorganism. Although many strains are susceptible to gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin, resistant forms have also developed. These multidrug-resistant bacteria make hospitals ''dangerous places to be, especially if you are sick, but even if not.'' 19 Although we are seeing a steady increase in resistance in almost every pathogen to most of the current antibiotics over time, not all the antibacterial agents show the same rate of resistance development. For example, antimicrobials such as rifampicin, which targets single enzymes, are most susceptible to the development of resistance, whereas agents that inactivate several targets irreversibly generate resistance more slowly.",

At least 30 new diseases emerged in the 1980s and 1990s and they are growing in incidence. Emerging infectious organisms often encounter hosts with no prior exposure to them and thus represent a novel challenge to the host's immune system. Several viruses responsible for human epidemics have made a transition from animal host to humans and are now transmitted from human to human. HIV, responsible for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, is one example. Although it has not been proven, it is suspected that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS coronavirus, also evolved from a different species. 20 In the early 1990s, after decades of decline, the incidence of tuberculosis began to increase. The epidemic took place owing to inadequate treatment regimens, a diminished public health system and the onset of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The WHO has predicted that between 2000 and 2020, nearly 1 billion people will become infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and that this disease will cost the lives of 35 million people.",

In this case, the infection is acquired from the bite of ticks belonging to several species of the genus Ixodes. Borrelia burgdorferi is the predominant cause of Lyme disease in the US, whereas Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are implicated in most European cases. The disease presentation varies widely, and may include a rash and flu-like symptoms in its initial stage, followed by musculoskeletal, arthritic, neurologic, psychiatric and cardiac manifestations. In the majority of cases, symptoms can be eliminated with antibiotics, especially if the treatment begins early in the course of illness. However, late or inadequate treatment can lead to 'late-stage' Lyme disease that can be disabling and difficult to treat. 21 (v) Other evolving pathogens include the Escherichia coli 0157:H7 (enterohemorrhagic E. coli), a strain that causes colitis and bloody diarrhea by producing a toxin called Shiga toxin, which damages the intestines. It is estimated that this bacterium causes infection in more than 70 000 patients a year in the USA. Another example is (vi) Cryptosporidium, an obligate intracellular parasite commonly found in lakes and rivers. Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the common species affecting the digestive and respiratory organs. Intestinal cryptosporidiosis is characterized by severe watery diarrhea. Pulmonary and tracheal cryptosporidiosis in humans is associated with coughing and is frequently a low-grade fever. People with severely weakened immune systems are likely to have more severe and more persistent symptoms than healthy individuals.",

In both the developing and developed nations, the leading cause of death by a wide margin is acute respiratory disease. In the developing world, acute respiratory infections are attributed primarily to seven bacteria: Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis. In addition, the major viral causes of respiratory infections include respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3, influenza viruses A and B, as well as some adenoviruses. These diseases are highly destructive in economic and social as well as in human terms and cause approximately 17 million deaths per year, and innumerable serious illnesses besides affecting the economic growth, development and prosperity of human societies. 22 Morse 23 identified six general factors in the emergence of infectious diseases: ecological changes, human demographics and behavior, international travel, technology and industry, microbial adaptation and change, and breakdown in public health measures. 24 One additional reason for developing new antibiotics is related to their own toxicity. As with other therapeutic agents, the use of antibiotics may also cause side effects in patients. These include mild reactions such as upset stomach, vomiting and diarrhea (cephalosporins, macrolides, penicillins and tetracyclines), rash and other mild and severe allergic reactions (cephalosporins and penicillins), sensitivity to sunlight (tetracyclines), nervousness, tremors and seizures (quinolones). Some side effects are more severe and, depending on the antibiotic, may disrupt the hearing function (aminoglycosides), kidneys (aminoglycosides and polypeptides) or liver (rifampin).",

These modified tetracyclines show potent activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including strains that carry the two major tetracycline-resistance determinants, involving efflux and ribosomal protection. Two of the glycylcyline derivatives, DMG-MINO and DMG-DMDOT, have been tested against a large number of clinical pathogens isolated from various sources. The spectrum of activity of these compounds includes organisms with resistance to antibiotics other than tetracyclines; for example, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. 27 Tigecycline was approved by the FDA in 2005 as an injectable antibiotic. 28 Among the novel class of antimicrobial agents used in treating resistance to Gram-positive infections, we can also mention the cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin produced by Streptomyces roseosporus. This compound was approved in 2003 by the FDA for skin infections resulting from complications following surgery, diabetic foot ulcers and burns. It represents the first new natural antibiotic approved in many years. Its mode of action is distinct from any other approved antibiotic: it rapidly kills Gram-positive bacteria by disrupting multiple aspects of bacterial membrane function (by binding irreversibly to the bacterial cell membrane, causing membrane depolarization, destroying the ion concentration gradient and provoking the efflux of K + ). It acts against most clinically relevant Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis and Enterococcus faecalis), and retains in vitro potency against isolates resistant to methicillin, vancomycin and linezolid. Traditionally, these infections were treated with penicillin and cephalosporins, but resistance to these agents became widespread.

It shows potent activity against pathogens implicated in communityacquired respiratory tract infections, irrespective of their b-lactam, macrolide or fluoroquinolone susceptibility. Some of the microorganisms susceptible to this antibiotic are pneumococci, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, including b-lactamase-positive strains. In addition, telithromycin has a very low potential for selection of resistant isolates or induction of cross-resistance found with other macrolides. 33 Clavulanic acid, first detected in Streptomyces clavuligerus, contains a bicyclic b-lactam ring fused to an oxazolidine ring with an oxygen in place of a sulfur, a b-hydroxyethylidene substituent at C-2 and no acylamino group at C-6. It was first described in 1976 and shown to be a potent inhibitor of the b-lactamases produced by staphylococci and plasmid-mediated b-lactamases of E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Shigella, Pseudomonas and Haemophilus. Although it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, clavulanic acid possesses only very low antibacterial activity. Therefore, the molecule has been combined, as a b-lactamase inhibitor, with a variety of broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillins. For example, when administered with amoxicillin, it is used for the treatment of infections caused by b-lactamase-producing pathogenic bacteria. 34 It has world sales of over US$1 billion, and in 1995 it was the second largest selling antibacterial drug. Clavulanic acid can also be combined with ticarcillin, which is a penicillin effective against organisms such as E. coli, Proteus, Salmonella, Haemophilus, Pseudomonas and S. aureus. It is normally used in hospitals for treating severe infections affecting blood or internal organs, bones and joints, upper or lower airways or skin and soft tissue. The combination extends ticarcillin antimicrobial activity by inhibiting the action of the b-lactamases produced by certain bacteria.",

            "text": "Mycosis is a condition in which fungi pass the resistance barriers of the human or animal body and establish infections. These organisms are harmless most of the time, but sometimes they can cause fungal infections. In most cases, these infections are not life threatening. However, when they are deeply invasive and disseminated, they lead to more serious infections, particularly in critically ill patients, elderly people and those who have conditions that affect the immune system (by disease or through the use of immunosuppressive agents). In addition, the use of antineoplastic and broad-spectrum antibiotics, prosthetic devices and grafts, and more aggressive surgery has increased invasive fungal infections. Patients with burns, neutropenia, pancreatitis or after organ transplantation (40% of liver transplants, 15-35% of heart transplants and 5% of kidney transplants) are also predisposed to fungal infection. 35 Approximately 40% of death from nosocomial infections are caused by fungi, and 80% of these are caused by Candida and Aspergillus, although Cryptococcus spp., Fusarium spp., Scedosporium spp., Penicillium spp. and zygomycetes are increasingly involved. 36 Pulmonary aspergillosis is the main factor involved in the death of recipients of bone marrow transplants, and Pneumocystis carinii is the leading cause of death in AIDS patients from Europe and North America. 37 The rising incidence of invasive fungal infections and the emergence of broader fungal resistance have led to the need for novel antifungal agents. Amphotericin B is the first-line therapy for systemic infection because of its broad spectrum and fungicidal activity. However, considerable side effects limit its clinical utility. Echinocandins are large lipopeptide molecules that inhibit the synthesis of 1,3-b-Dglucan, a key component of the fungal cell wall. Three echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin) have reached the market. Caspofungin is also known as pneumocandin or MK-0991. This compound was the first cell-wall-active antifungal approved as a new injectable antifungal; this was in 2000. 38 It irreversibly inhibits 1,3-b-D-glucan synthase, preventing the formation of glucan polymers and disrupting the integrity of fungal cell walls. 39 It is more active and less toxic than amphotericin B and shows a broad spectrum of activity against Candida (including fluconozole resistance), Aspergillus, Histoplasma and P. carinii, the major cause of HIV death. Micafungin is licensed for clinical use in Asian countries and in the US. This compound exhibits extremely potent antifungal activity against clinically important fungi, including Aspergillus and azole-resistant strains of Candida. In animal studies, micafungin is as efficacious as amphotericin B with respect to improvement of survival rate. It is characterized by a linear pharmacokinetic profile and substantially fewer toxic effects. Anidulafungin is currently licensed in the US. 40 Although several new antifungal drugs have been developed in the past 6 years, some patients remain resistant to treatments. The main reasons for this include intrinsic or acquired antifungal resistance, organ dysfunction preventing the use of some agents and drug interactions. In addition, some drugs penetrate poorly into sanctuary sites, including the eye and urine, and others are associated with considerable adverse events. However, there has been some progress. Posaconazole is a new member of the triazole class of antifungals. It has shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis and has potential as a salvage therapy for invasive aspergillosis, zygomycosis, cryptococcal meningitis and a variety of other fungal infections. It is available as an oral suspension and has a favorable toxicity profile. The wide spectrum of posaconazole activity in in vitro studies, animal models and preliminary clinical studies suggests that it represents an important addition to the antifungal armamentarium. 41 ",

Anthracyclines act by intercalating DNA strands, which result in a complex formation that inhibits the synthesis of DNA and RNA. It also triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in mechanisms that lead to cell death. In their cytotoxic effects, the binding to cell membranes and plasma proteins plays an important role. Their main adverse effects are heart damage (cardiotoxicity), which considerably limits their usefulness, and vomiting. The first anthracycline discovered was daunorubicin (daunomycin) in 1966, which is produced naturally by Streptomyces peucetius. Doxorubicin (adriamycin) was developed in 1967. Another anthracycline is epirubicin. This compound, approved by the FDA in 1999, is favored over doxorubicin in some chemotherapy regimens as it appears to cause fewer side effects. Epirubicin has a different spatial orientation of the hydroxyl group at the 4\u00a2 carbon of the sugar, which may account for its faster elimination and reduced toxicity. Epirubicin is primarily used against breast and ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and lymphomas. Valrubicin is a semisynthetic analog of doxorubicin approved as a chemotherapeutic drug in 1999 and used to treat bladder cancer.",

Their antitumor activity is apparently due to the cleavage of double-stranded DNA. 55 They are highly toxic, but it was possible to introduce one such compound into the clinic by attaching it to an antibody that delivered it to certain cancer types selectively. This ingenious idea of the Wyeth Laboratories avoided the side effects of calicheamicin. In this regard, gemtuzumab is effective against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Calicheamicin is bound to a monoclonal antibody against a transmembrane receptor (CD33) expressed on cells of monocytic/myeloid lineage. CD33 is expressed in most leukemic blast cells, but in normal hematopoietic cells the intensity diminishes with maturation. It was approved by the FDA for use in patients over the age of 60 years with relapsed AML who are not considered candidates for standard chemotherapy. 56 A successful non-actinomycete molecule is taxol (paclitaxel), which was first isolated from the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia, but is also produced by the endophytic fungi Taxomyces andreanae and Nodulisporium sylviforme. 57 This compound inhibits rapidly dividing mammalian cancer cells by promoting tubulin polymerization and interfering with normal microtubule breakdown during cell division. The drug also inhibits several fungi (Pythium, Phytophthora and Aphanomyces) by the same mechanism. In 1992, taxol was approved for refractory ovarian cancer, and today it is used against breast and advanced forms of Kaposi's sarcoma. 58 A new formulation is available in which paclitaxel is bound to albumin. Taxol sales amounted to US$1.6 billion in 2006 for Bristol Myers-Squibb, representing 10% of the company's pharmaceutical sales and its third largest selling product. Currently, taxol production uses plant cell fermentation technology.",

Five analogs are now undergoing investigation as candidate anticancer drugs, and their preclinical studies have indicated a broad spectrum of antitumor activity, including taxol-resistant tumor cells. With the best currently available therapies, the median survival time for patients with metastatic breast cancer is only 2-3 years, and many patients develop resistance to taxanes or other chemotherapy drugs. One epothilone, ixabepilone, was approved in October 2007 by the FDA for use in the treatment of aggressive metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer no longer responding to currently available chemotherapies. 62 In tumor cells, p-glycoprotein reduces intracellular antitumor drug concentrations, thereby limiting access of chemotherapeutic substrates to the site of action.

            "text": "In the pathogenic processes of some diseases, such as emphysema, arthritis, pancreatitis, cancer and AIDS, protease inhibitors are potentially powerful tools for inactivating target proteases. Examples of microbial products include antipain, produced by Streptomyces yokosukaensis, leupeptin from Streptomyces roseochromogenes and chymostatin from Streptomyces hygroscopicus. 70 Leupeptin is produced by more than 17 species of actinomycetes. 67 XO catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to uric acid through xanthine. An excessive accumulation of uric acid in the blood, called hyperuricemia, causes gout. 77 The inhibitors of XO decrease the uric acid levels, which result in an antihyperuricemic effect. A potent inhibitor of XO, hydroxyakalone, was purified from the fermentation broth of Agrobacterium aurantiacum sp. nov., a marine bacterial strain. 78 Fungal products are also used as enzyme inhibitors against cancer, diabetes, poisonings, Alzheimer's disease, etc. The enzymes inhibited include acetylcholinesterase, protein kinase, tyrosine kinase, glycosidases and others. 79 Immunosuppresants Suppressor cells are critical in the regulation of the normal immune response. An individual's immune system is capable of distinguishing between native and foreign antigens and of mounting a response only against the latter. A major role has been established for suppressor T lymphocytes in this phenomenon. Suppressor cells also play a role in regulating the magnitude and duration of the specific antibody response to an antigenic challenge. Suppression of the immune response either by drugs or by radiation, to prevent the rejection of grafts or transplants or to control autoimmune diseases, is called immunosuppression.",

Cyclosporin A was originally introduced as a narrow-spectrum antifungal peptide produced by the mold, Tolypocladium nivenum (originally classified as Trichoderma polysporum and later as Tolypocladium inflatum), by aerobic fermentation. Cyclosporins are a family of neutral, highly lipophilic, cyclic undecapeptides containing some unusual amino acids, synthesized by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. Discovery of the immunosuppressive activity led to its use in heart, liver and kidney transplants and to the overwhelming success of the organ transplant field. 80 Cyclosporin was approved for use in 1983. It is thought to bind to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of immunocompetent lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. This complex of cyclosporin and cyclophilin inhibits calcineurin, which under normal circumstances is responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin-2. It also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release and therefore leads to a reduced function of effector T cells. Sales of cyclosporin A have reached US$1.5 billion per year.",

            "text": "Other important transplant agents include sirolimus (rapamycin) and tacrolimus (FK506), which are produced by actinomycetes. Rapamycin is especially useful in kidney transplants as it lacks the nephrotoxicity seen with cyclosporin A and tacrolimus. It is a macrolide, first discovered in 1975 as a product of S. hygroscopicus, and was initially proposed as an antifungal agent. However, this was abandoned when it was discovered that it had potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties. This compound binds to the immunophilin FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), and this binary complex interacts with the rapamycin-binding domain and inactivates a serine-threonine kinase termed the mammalian target of rapamycin. The latter is known to control proteins that regulate mRNA translation initiation and G1 progression. 81 The antiproliferative effect of rapamycin has also been used in conjunction with coronary stents to prevent restenosis, which usually occurs after the treatment of coronary artery disease by balloon angioplasty. Rapamycin also shows promise in treating tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a congenital disorder that leaves sufferers prone to benign tumor growth in the brain, heart, kidneys, skin and other organs. In a study of rapamycin as a treatment for TSC, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) researchers observed a major improvement in mice regarding retardation related to autism. 82 As rapamycin has poor aqueous solubility, some of its analogs, RAD001 (everolimus), CCI-799 (tensirolimus) and AP23573 (ARIAD), have been developed with improved pharmaceutical properties. Everolimus is currently used as an immunosuppressant to prevent the rejection of organ transplants. Although it does not have FDA approval in the USA, it is approved for use in Europe and Australia, and phase III trials are being conducted in the US. Everolimus may have a role in heart transplantation as it has been shown to reduce chronic allograft vasculopathy in such transplants. 83 Everolimus is also used in drug-eluting coronary stents as an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection. CCI-779 is a rapamycin ester that can be converted to rapamycin in vivo. RAD001 is a rapamycin analog currently being investigated in phase II trials for recurrent endometrial cancer as a single agent, and in phase I/II trials for the treatment of glioblastoma in combination with the inhibitor of certain epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family members. 84 AP23573 is a novel non-prodrug rapamycin analog with a nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior that has demonstrated antiproliferative activity against several human tumor cell lines in vitro and against experimental tumors in vivo. 85 This agent is currently under evaluation in phase I-II trials, including patients with different tumors. Two additional small-molecule rapamycin analogs, AP23841 and AP23675, are currently in preclinical development for the treatment of bone metastases and primary bone cancer. 86 Tacrolimus (FK506) was discovered in 1987 in Japan. 87 It is produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis. However, its use was almost abandoned because of dose-associated toxicity. Dr Thomas Starzl (University of Pittsburgh) rescued it by using lower doses, realizing that it was approximately 100 times more active as an immunosuppressive than cyclosporin A. 88 It was introduced in Japan in 1993, and in 1994 it was approved by the FDA for use as an immunosuppressant in liver transplantation. Furthermore, its use has been extended to include bone marrow, cornea, heart, intestines, kidney, lung, pancreas, trachea, small bowel, skin and limb transplants, and for the prevention of graft-vs-host disease. Topically, it is also used against atopic dermatitis, a widespread skin disease. In the laboratory, tacrolimus inhibits the mixed lymphocyte reaction, the formation of interleukin-2 by T lymphocytes, and the formation of other soluble mediators, including interleukin-3 and interferon g. Recently, it has been reported that tacrolimus inhibits tumor growth factor-b-induced signaling and collagen synthesis in human lung fibroblastic cells. This factor plays a pivotal role in tissue fibrosis, including pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, tacrolimus may be useful for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis, although its use in the acute inflammatory phase may exacerbate lung injury. 89 Hypocholesterolemic drugs Atherosclerosis is generally viewed as a chronic, progressive disease characterized by the continuous accumulation of atheromatous plaque within the arterial wall. The past two decades have witnessed the introduction of a variety of anti-atherosclerotic therapies. The statins form a class of hypolipidemic drugs used to lower cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme in the liver stimulates low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL from the bloodstream and a decrease in blood cholesterol levels. Through their cholesterol-lowering effect, they reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, prevent stroke and reduce the development of peripheral vascular disease. 90 In addition, they are anti-thrombotic and antiinflammatory.",

In 1972, the Z\u00e4hner group in Germany isolated phosphinothricin tripeptide, a peptide antibiotic consisting of two molecules of L-alanine and one molecule of the unusual amino acid L-phosphinothricin; that is, N(4[hydroxyl(methyl)phosphinoyl]homoalanyl)alanylalanine. They isolated it from Streptomyces viridochromogenes as a broad-spectrum antibacterial including activity against Botrytis cinerea. 101 In Japan, it was discovered at the Meiji Seiki laboratories in 1973 from S. hygroscopicus and named bialaphos. 102 The bioactive L-phosphinothricin is a structural analog of glutamic acid, acting as a competitive inhibitor of glutamine synthetase, and has bactericidal (Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria), fungicidal (B. cinerea) and herbicidal properties. 103 Glufosinate (DL-phosphinothricin) (without Ala-Ala) was developed as a herbicide. Therefore, the agent acts as a herbicide with or without Ala-Ala. Bialaphos has no influence on microorganisms in the soil and is easily degraded in the environment, having a half-life of only 2 h. This low level of environmental impact is of great interest to environmentalists.",

Parasites are organisms that inhabit the body and benefit from a prolonged, close association with the host. Antiparasitics are compounds that inhibit the growth or reproduction of a parasite; some antiparasitics directly kill parasites. In general, parasites are much smaller than their hosts, show a high degree of specialization for their mode of life and reproduce more quickly and in greater numbers than their hosts. Classic examples of parasitism include the interactions between vertebrate hosts and such diverse animals as tapeworms, flukes, Plasmodium species and fleas. Parasitic infections can cause potentially serious health problems and even kill the host. Parasites mainly enter the body through the mouth, usually through ingestion of tainted food or drink. This is a very common problem in tropical areas, but is not limited to those regions. There are 3200 varieties of parasites in four major categories: Protozoa, Trematoda, Cestoda and Nematoda. The major groups include protozoans (organisms having only one cell) and parasitic worms (helminths). Each of these can infect the digestive tract, and sometimes two or more can cause infection at the same time. The WHO reported that approximately 25% of the world's population is infected with roundworms. In addition, a major agricultural problem has been the infection of farm animals by worms.",

Certain antibiotics were also shown to possess antihelmintic activity against nematodes or cestodes, but these failed to compete with the synthetic compounds. Although Merck had earlier developed a commercially useful synthetic product, thiabendazole, they had enough foresight to examine microbial broths for antihelmintic activity, and found a non-toxic fermentation broth that killed the intestinal nematode Nematosporoides dubius in mice. The Streptomyces avermitilis culture, isolated by \u014c mura and coworkers at the Kitasato Institute in Japan, 104 produced a family of secondary metabolites (eight compounds) with both antihelmintic and insecticidal activities. These compounds, named 'avermectins,' are pentacyclic, 16-membered macrocyclic lactones, that harbor a disaccharide of the methylated sugar, oleandrose, with exceptional activity against parasites, especially Nemathelminthes (nematodes) and arthropod parasites (10 times higher than any known synthetic antihelmintic agent). Surprisingly, avermectins lack activity against bacteria and fungi, do not inhibit protein synthesis and are not ionophores. Instead, they interfere with neurotransmission in many invertebrates, causing paralysis and death by neuromuscular attacks. 105 The annual market for avermectins surpasses US$1 billion. They are used against both nematode and arthropod parasites in sheep, cattle, dogs, horses and swine. A semisynthetic derivative, 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1 ('ivermectin') is 1000 times more active than thiabendazole and is a commercial veterinary product. The efficacy of ivermectin has made it a promising candidate for the control of human onchocerciasis and human strongyloidiasis. 106 Another avermectin, called doramectin (or cyclohexyl avermectin B1), produced by 'mutational biosynthesis' was commercialized for use by food animals. 107 A semisynthetic monosaccharide derivative of doramectin called selamectin is the most recently commercialized avermectin, and is active against heartworms (Dirofilaria immitis) and fleas in companion animals. Although the macrocyclic backbone of each of these molecules (ivermectin, doramectin and selamectin) is identical, there are different substitutions at pharmacologically relevant sites such as C-5, C-13, C-22,23 and C-25. 108 The avermectins are closely related to the milbemycins, a group of non-glycosidated macrolides produced by S. hygroscopicus subsp. Aureolacrimosus. 109 These compounds possess activity against worms and insects.",

            "text": "Coccidiostats are used for the prevention of coccidiosis in both extensively and intensively reared poultry. Coccidiosis is the name given to a common intestinal disease caused by the invading protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria that affects several different animal species (cattle, dogs, cats, poultry, etc.). The major damage is caused by the rapid multiplication of the parasite in the intestinal wall and the subsequent rupture of the cells of the intestinal lining, leading to high mortality and severe loss of productivity. Coccidia are obligate intracellular parasites that show host specificity; only cattle coccidia will cause disease in cattle; other species-specific coccidia will not. For many years, synthetic compounds were used to combat coccidiosis in poultry; however, resistance developed rapidly. A solution came on the scene with the discovery of the narrow-spectrum polyether antibiotic monensin, which had extreme potency against the coccidian. 110 Made by Streptomyces cinnamonensis, monensin led the way for additional microbial ionophoric antibiotics, such as lasalocid, narasin and salinomycin. All are produced by various Streptomyces species. They form complexes with the polar cations K + , Na + , Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ , severely affecting the osmotic balance in the parasitic cells and thus causing their death. 111 The widespread use of anticoccidials has revolutionized the poultry industry by reducing the mortality and production losses caused by coccidiosis. Of great interest was another extremely valuable application of monensin; that is, growth promotion in ruminants. Synthetic chemicals had been tested for years to inhibit wasteful methane production by cattle and sheep and increase fatty acid formation (especially propionate) to improve feed efficiency; however, they failed. The solution was monensin, which became a major success as a ruminant growth enhancer. 110 For more than 40 years, certain antibiotics have been used in foodanimal production to enhance feed utilization and weight gain. 112 From a production standpoint, feed antibiotics have been consistently shown to improve animal weight gain and feed efficiency, especially in younger animals. These responses are probably derived from an inhibitory effect on the normal microbiota, which can lead to reduced intestinal inflammation and improved nutrient utilization. 113 Pigs in the USA are exposed to a great variety of antibiotics. These include b-lactam antibiotics (including penicillins), lincosamides and macrolides (including erythromycin and tetracyclines). All these groups have members that are used to treat infections in humans. In addition, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, pleuromutilins, quinoxalines and virginiamycin are utilized as growth stimulants. Flavophospholipol and virginiamycin are also used as growth promoters in poultry.",

However, antibiotic resistance in microbes has created a dangerous situation and the need for new antibiotics is clear. Unfortunately, most of the large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for new antimicrobial compounds. Owing to the economics, they have concluded that drugs directed against chronic diseases offer a better revenue stream than do antimicrobial agents, as for the latter the length of treatment is short and government restriction is likely. Some small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing antibiotics, but most depend on venture capital rather than sales income, and with the present regulations, they face huge barriers to enter the market. These barriers were raised with the best intentions of ensuring public safety, but will have the opposite effect if they terminate antibiotic development while resistance continues to increase. 121 However, there are some bright possibilities. One of the most promising is the utilization of uncultivated microorganisms. Considering that 99% of the bacteria and 95% of the fungi have not been cultivated in the laboratory, putting efforts into finding means to grow such microorganisms are proceeding and succeeding. 122 Furthermore, researchers are now extracting bacterial DNA from soil and marine habitats, cloning large fragments into, for example, bacterial artificial chromosomes, expressing in a host bacterium and screening the library for new antibiotics. This metagenomic effort is allowing access to a vast untapped reservoir of genetic and metabolic diversity, 123, 124 which could result in the discovery of new and useful natural products. 125 In addition to these two relatively new techniques, the chemical and biological modification of old antibiotics could still supply new and powerful drugs.
