Since outbreak of unexplained pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China in December, 2019(2), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to more than 90 countries. By 7 th March, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 has influenced 101,918 patients globally(3). Recommended by World Health Organization (WHO)(4), a positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) result could confirm the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients. However, there still lacks thoroughly research concerning nucleic acid conversion time among different samples in COVID-19 patients. Here we compared the nucleic acid conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 in different samples of intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients and analyzed their characteristics.",

For blood, the conversion time was 10.17 \u00b1 6.134 and 14.63 \u00b1 5.878 days in non-ICU and ICU patients respectively. Saliva in non-ICU and ICU patients took 13.33\u00b15.272 and 16.50\u00b16.188 days separately to converse to negative. As shown in Figure 1B, the nucleic acid conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 of nasal swab in non-ICU patients was significantly shorter than ICU patients (P=0.02). No obvious significance was indicated in blood and saliva samples between non-ICU and ICU groups. RT-PCR was a widely used tool in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Guided by WHO(4), two consecutive negative RT-PCR result with at least two days apart should be achieved before discharge of patients. Several cases have been reported negative of RT-PCR tests before confirmation(1). In our study, one patient experienced five continuous negative results before admission and then the sixth nasal swab on admission finally supported his diagnosis. Considering this situation, the molecular diagnosis should be made with other clinical samples or other NAAT tests including serological tests, CRISPR, or metagenomic sequencing. The nucleic acid conversion time of SARS-CoV-2 was reported around two weeks(5). The longer time consumed to turn from positive to negative in nasal swabs than in blood and saliva samples was in accordance with the respiratory transmission characteristics of the disease, and indicated that a longer surveillance needed in respiratory samples for nucleic acid testing.",
