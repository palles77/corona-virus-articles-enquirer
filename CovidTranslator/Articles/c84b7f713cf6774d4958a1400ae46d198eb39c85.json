Our patient had a history of long exposure to immunotherapy: a kind of paradoxical immunological response to influenza infection/vaccination during immune checkpoint inhibitors have been described [5] , but we have no data regarding immune checkpoint inhibitors and the risk of COVID-19. Our patient presented a rapid evolution of respiratory failure and wasn't treated with more invasive procedures, probably due to his cancer and emphysema history. We don't know if treatment with steroids, not routinely recommended in COVID-19 but very useful to contrast side effects of immunotherapy, could help to control pneumonitis in these patients.",
