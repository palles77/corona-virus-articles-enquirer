About 10 min after synthesis of the E1 protein, N-acetyl-galactosamine was added. This was followed ~10 min later by the addition of both galactose and sialic acid to give the mature oligosaccharides. This sequence of additions was confirmed by analyzing the 3H-labeled oligosaccharides bound to each of the El forms using gel filtration on P4 columns. The intracellular location of the first step was determined by ex-",

The virus normally buds first into a smooth membrane compartment lying between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the cis side of the Golgi stack (Tooze et al., 1984) . At 31\u00b0C the virus is assembled but does not appear to enter the Golgi stacks. The addition of N-acetyl-galactosamine is unaffected although the addition of galactose and sialic acid is inhibited. These results strongly suggest that addition of N-acetyl-galactosamine occurs in this budding compartment, the morphology of which is similar to that of transitional elements and vesicles. p ROTEINS exported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)' move through each of the cisternae of the Golgi stack before they are directed to their correct destination either inside or outside the cell (Rothman, 1981; Griffiths and Simons, 1986; Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . Many proteins undergo a series of posttranslational modifications during this transport including the addition of oligosaccharides which are either N-linked to asparagine or O-linked to serine or threonine. The sequence of modifications to these covalently bound oligosaccharides reflects the movement of the protein from one compartment to the next on the transport pathway. The addition and modification of the N-linked oligosaccharides has been extensively investigated (reviewed by Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1980) but much less is known about the addition of O-linked oligosaccharides. For the simplest and most common type there is indirect evidence that construction of the O-linked glycans is a two-step process, the addition of N-acetyl-galactosamine (GalNAc) preceding that of galactose (Gal) and sialic acid (NANA). The addition of the last two sugars almost certainly occurs in the trans part of the Golgi stack (Cummings et al., 1983; Elhammer and Kornfeld, 1984) . Proposals for the site of addition of the first sugar, however, range from the rough ER (Strous, 1979) , where the proteins are assembled, to the 1. Abbreviations used in this paper: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Gal, galactose; GalNAc, N-acetyl-galactosamine; MEM-met, methionine-free modified Eagle's medium; MHV-A59, mouse hepatitis virus, strain A59; NANA, N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (sialic acid); Tx-114, Triton X-tI4. cis part of the Golgi stack which is the entry point for proteins that have left the ER (Cummings et al., 1983; Roth, 1984) , to the medial part (Niemann et al., 1982; Elhammer and Kornfeld, 1984) , and finally to the trans-Golgi cisternae (Johnson and Spear, 1983) . Most of the evidence supports the idea that GalNAc is added either just before or just after the protein leaves the ER. There are several reasons why it has proven so difficult to locate the site of this first sugar addition, of which the absence of a combined biochemical and morphological study of the O-glycosylation of a single protein must rank as the most important.",

MHV-A59 buds intracellularly and E1 is the only viral membrane protein needed for budding (Holmes et al., 1981a, b; Rottier et al., 1981) . After synthesis in the rough ER this protein is transported to a smooth membrane compartment between the rough ER and Golgi stack where it accumulates allowing nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm to bind which results in the formation of a virion (Holmes et al., 1981a; Tooze et al., 1984) . The virions then follow the secretory pathway out of the cell (Holmes et al., 1981b; Tooze et al., 1987) . The virions contain in addition to E1 a second envelope glycoprotein, E2, which is essential for infectivity (Sturman, 1981) and is incorporated at some as yet undefined stage during the budding or transport of the virions through intracellular compartments. E2 is a fusogen and is also transported in cellular membranes to the plasma membrane where it helps spread the infection by inducing the fusion of infected cells with contiguous uninfected cells (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) .",

            "text": "At 37\u00b0C, sac(-) cells release progeny virus exponentially, beginning at ~5 h after the start of infection and continuing until the cells lyse. The release of E1 molecules in virions parallels the release of virus particles consistent with the known dependence of budding on the E1 glycoprotein (Tooze, 1987) . Holmes and Behnke (1981) observed in a preliminary morphological study that at 32\u00b0C virions were assembled, but accumulated within the infected cell instead of being released. To confirm this observation, infected sac(-) cells were incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C and the release of infectious virus was measured by a plaque titration assay over the next 6 h in cultures either kept at 37\u00b0C or shifted to 31\u00b0C. As an added precaution, cells were treated for 2-3 min with proteinase K 3.5 h after infection to remove any virions from the infecting inoculum still remaining on the cell surface. This ensured that only released progeny particles were measured. Infected cells were labeled from 6 to 9 h after infection with [3~S]methionine in MEM-met containing 5 Ixg/p.I cold methionine at 37 or 31 \u00b0C. At the end of the labeling period the cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 4\u00b0C for 2-3 min. The proteinase K was neutralized with PMSF and the cells were pelleted at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was then pooled with the medium collected from the cells before the proteinase K treatment and the labeled virions were purified on sucrose gradients. Both cells and virions were subjected to Tx-114 extraction followed by SDS-PAGE. * Counts per minute in all forms of El detected by fluorography, including the lower molecular weight forms of El generated by proteinase K digestion (Rottier et al., 1984 (Rottier et al., ). 1981a Rottier et al., 1981) . To eliminate the possibility that at 31\u00b0C the cells were releasing large numbers of noninfectious particles, which would not be scored in an infectivity assay, El contained in virus particles released from the cells was quantitated. Infected cells were labeled from 6 to 9 h after infection with pSS]methionine at 37 and 31\u00b0C, the medium was collected, and any labeled virions associated with the plasma membrane were removed by proteinase K treatment at 4\u00b0C and pooled with the virions in the medium. After SDS-PAGE and fluorography of virions purified from the medium, the E1 band was excised and counted. As shown in Table II , the 6\u00b0C drop in temperature during the labeling period inhibited the release of virion-associated E1 by >80%. In marked contrast, however, the total amount of E1 synthesized was reduced by only ,x,20% upon shifting the temperature to 31\u00b0C (Table II) . Total protein synthesis, in both infected and uninfected cells, was on average decreased by only 23 % over the same time period. The discrepancy between the observed 1,000-fold decrease in the release of infectious virions (Table I ) and the fivefold decrease in the release of virion-associated E1 (Table II ) may mean that at 31\u00b0C more noninfectious particles are assembled and released. However, we favor an alternative explanation, namely, that proteinase K treatment damages some cells and leads to artifactual release of intracellular virions because, when medium is collected from cells at 31\u00b0C without proteinase K treatment, the amount of methioninelabeled virion-associated E1 is below the limits of detection by fluorography after SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Furthermore, electron microscopic studies of thin sections of infected cells incubated at 31\u00b0C from 7 to 24 h after infection reveal very few extracellular virions associated with the plasma membrane (see below and Fig. 10) .",

At 7 h after infection at 37\u00b0C, E1 was restricted to a perinuclear region (Fig. 7 a) and the pattern of labeling was similar to, but more extensive than, that observed with antibodies specific for an endogenous Golgi protein (data not shown). Between 7 and 12 h after infection at 37\u00b0C syncytia developed, each containing several hundred nuclei, and concomitantly E1 became detectable in the rough ER throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 7 b) . At these late times the mAb against E1 also labeled patches at the cell surface (Fig. 7 b) ; this labeling we attribute to released progeny virions, which are known to remain closely associated with the cell surface (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1984) . In contrast, when the cells were shifted at 7 h after infection to 31\u00b0C and incubated until 12 h after infection, the E1 labeling within the cells remained restricted to the peri-Golgi region, although the area and intensity of labeling increased above that seen at 7 h after infection (Fig. 7, a and c) . Furthermore, neither the rough ER nor the surface of cells incubated from 7 to 12 h after infection at 31\u00b0C labeled for El. These observations imply that E1 accumulated in the perinuclear region during the incubation at 31\u00b0C and that virions were not transported out of the cell. During the 5-h incubation at 31\u00b0C, the syncitia also failed to enlarge significantly, The viral envelope glycoprotein E2 is responsible for viral-induced cell fusion (Sturman and Holmes, 1985) and we attribute the lack of growth of the syncytia to the failure in the transport of virions out of the cells. There may also be, at 31\u00b0C, a reduction in the transport to the plasma membrane of E2 as a membrane glycoprotein, independent of the transport of virions, but this was not investigated. This inhibition of the enlargement of the syncytia was reversible; they expanded rapidly within 2-3 h after a return to 37\u00b0C (data not shown).",

At these early times, the first and only site of budding was a smooth membraned compartment with a complex and irregular vesiculotubular morphology (Fig. 8) . This compartment, which we refer to here as the budding compartment, was always closely associated with cisternae of the rough ER, including transitional elements. Usually, but not always, the budding compartment was also juxtaposed to the cis side of the Golgi stack (see Fig. 11 ). Since the membrane of the budding compartment is smooth it cannot be the site of synthesis of E1 or its insertion into membranes. Furthermore, we have reported previously that the budding compartment does not contain a cytochemical marker of the rough ER (Tooze et al., 1984) . We conclude that the initial site of accumulation of E1 to levels that support budding is a distinct smooth- membraned compartment usually found between transitional elements of the rough ER and usually lies between them and the Golgi complex.",

In part, no doubt, this is a result of the budding of virions, each ~1,000/~ in diam, into this compartment in the infected cells. Although we have not made extensive morphometric analyses of the budding compartment, it is clear from examination of single and serial sections that its volume and surface area are smaller than those of either the Golgi complex or the rough ER.",

Few virions are seen within the Golgi cisternae or in post-Golgi transport vesicles (Fig. 10) , and very few are seen outside the cells associated with the plasma membrane.

In uninfected cells this compartment (arrowheads) is found closely associated with transitional element regions of the rough ER (arrows). Often the budding compartment occurs between transitional elements and Golgi stacks but sometimes, as this figure shows, it is not adjacent to a Golgi stack. In this situation, because of the absence of smooth cis-Golgi membranes, it is easier to trace the budding compartment through serial sections. Note the complex irregular morphology of the budding compartment and the absence of ribosomes from its membrane. The micrographs shown are of nine sections (SI-$5, $7, and $I0-S12) from a continuous ribbon of 13 sections, each ,~50-60 nm thick. In this example, therefore, the budding compartment extended through a depth of ,,,650 nm. All micrographs are at the same magnification.

            "text": "The addition of Gal and NANA probably occurs in the trans-Golgi complex, because the necessary enzymes are found there (Carlson et al., 1973; Sadler et al., 1979; Rearick et al., 1979; Elhammer and Kornfeld, 1984) and drugs which inhibit transport into and through the Golgi complex (Quinn et al., 1983; Tartakoff et al., 1983) inhibit formation of the mature oligosaccharide structure. We have found that both monensin and CCCP inhibit the glycosylation of E1 in a manner essentially identical to the inhibition at 31\u00b0C (Tooze, 1987) . Such results must, however, be interpreted with some caution because with these drugs it is often impossible to distinguish between inhibition of transport and direct inhibition of the enzymes which add the sugars. The pathway taken by newly synthesized E1 is complicated by the intracellular budding of the virus. At its simplest, one can envisage that E1 moves to the budding compartment, nucleocapsids bind and bud, and E1 then moves through the secretory pathway as part of the maturing virion. However, immunoperoxidase labeling shows clearly that E1 in the Golgi complex is not only present in virions but also in every cisternal membrane (see Fig. 11 ). The amount of E1 in Golgi membranes cannot be estimated because of the catalytic nature of the peroxidase technique but, until very late in the viral infection, it must be lower than that needed to support budding of the virus. This accumulation of E1 in the Golgi membranes during infection may represent a dead end caused by \"leakage\" of E1 from the budding compartment if the nucleocapsids are unable to trap all of the E1 in budding virions. This idea is supported by the finding that E1 is not transported beyond the Golgi stack in cellular membranes (Tooze and Stanley, 1986; Tooze et al., 1987) . Alternatively, cisternal E1 may represent a genuine part of the maturation pathway. El may have to move through Golgi cisternae and then back again to the budding compartment before it can participate in the budding reaction. This seems very unlikely, however, because all attempts to show movement of other ER proteins to the Golgi stack and back again have failed (Yamamoto et al., 1985; Brands et al., 1985) . It is, therefore, more reasonable to assume that E1 is transported from the membrane of the ER to the budding compartment where it reaches a concentration sufficient to allow budding for the first time. Thereafter, incorporated into the envelope of progeny virions, it moves through the Golgi stack and thence to the cell surface with only a small amount leaking to the Golgi stack independent of the virions. As the infection progresses the amount of El being synthesized increases (our unpublished data) and at the same time budding of progeny virions directly into the lumen of the rough ER begins and increases. We interpret this to indicate that the rate of insertion of E1 into the rough ER membrane beings to exceed the rate of its transport out of the ER to the budding compartment.",

All the morphological evidence suggests that at 31\u00b0C it is the entry of virions into the Golgi complex that is inhibited; as a result, few virions are seen in the Golgi cisternae or in the post Golgi transport vesicles and the Golgi stack maintains its normal morphology. The inhibition of virion transport is accompanied by an inhibition of terminal glycosylation. This would be expected if (a) terminal glycosylation occurred in the trans-Golgi complex and, (b) if the E1 is delivered there normally incorporated in the envelopes of progeny virions rather than as an integral protein of cellular membranes. But at 31\u00b0C, addition of GalNAc still occurs to an unchanged extent suggesting that this sugar is added in or just before the budding compartment.",

If GalNAc was added either cotranslationally or while the E1 resided in the rough ER membrane, an increase in the amount of the Eli form would be expected both at 37 and 31\u00b0C as the concentration of E1 reaches levels that not only support budding into this compartment but also can readily be detected by immunocytochemistry (Tooze et al., 1985) .

            "text": "The budding compartment is not a product of infection because it is found in uninfected sac(-) cells and our preliminary observations of serial sections of rat exocrine pancreatic cells and murine AtT20 cells shows that it is not peculiar to sac(-) cells. In all three cell types, the budding compartment is found frequently in close association with patches of rough ER differentiated into transitional elements in regions juxtaposed to the cis side of the Golgi apparatus. However, the budding compartment and transitional elements of the rough ER in sac(-) cells are not restricted to this region; they also occur associated with patches of rough ER remote from the Golgi apparatus. The existence of peripheral transitional elements in pancreatic cells has long been known (Jamieson and Palade, 1967) . Our observations, together with those of Saraste and Kuismanen (1984) , Tartakoff (1986) , and Merisko et al. (1986) indicate that the structure of the transitional element-transitional vesicle region of the cell is considerably more complex than hitherto appreciated. Fig. 12 summarizes our interpretation of the results described above which suggest that GalNAc is added in the budding compartment. This is not to say that the enzyme, N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase, is found exclusively in this compartment, although available fractionation data shows that it is restricted to smooth membranes (Kim et al., 1971; Ko and Raghupathy, 1972; Hanover et al., 1980 Hanover et al., , 1982 Elhammer and Kornfeld, 1984) . One must remember that the position of an enzyme can only be inferred from the position of the substrate and product subject to certain strict criteria. Obviously, the enzyme cannot be located in the pathway after the point at which the substrate acquires the sugar, but it can exist at any site up to the point at which the substrate appears to be modified. This is because the substate may have to assume a particular conformation before it can be acted upon by the enzyme. The N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase could be present earlier in the pathway than the budding compartment but the E1 may not be a substrate until it reaches the budding compartment. Alternatively, the means of detecting the modification may depend on the substrate conformation. The presence of protein-bound GalNAc in the cis Golgi as detected by lectin labeling (Roth, 1984) may reflect addition of the sugar in this compartment or in some prior compartment in which the protein-bound oligosaccharide is inaccessible to the lectin. These possibilities are not normally considered but they could explain the large and otherwise irreconcilable discrepancies in the location that has been assigned to N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase (Strous, 1979; Niemann et al., 1982; Cummings et al., Figure 12 . Schematic illustrating the first site of budding of MHV-A59 into a smooth membrane compartment between the transitional elements of the ER and the Golgi stack. Reduced temperature blocks entry of the virions into the Golgi stack and prevents El acquiring galactose and sialic acid but not GalNAc. This sugar is probably added in the budding compartment which is of limited size and distinct from both the ER and Golgi apparatus.",

            "text": "1983; Johnson and Spear, 1983) . These differences will only be resolved by locating the enzyme itself using an immunocytochemical technique. The transport to the plasma membrane of the envelope glycoproteins of the influenza virus, SFV, and VSV can be slowed in the trans-most Golgi compartment by reducing the incubation temperature from 37 to 20\u00b0C (Matlin and Simons, 1983; Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984; Fuller et al., 1985) . Blocking the transport of these proteins from the rough ER to the Golgi stacks requires a further reduction in temperature to 16\u00b0C (Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984) . By contrast, lowering the incubation temperature by only 6\u00b0C, from 37 to 31\u00b0C, results in at least a 1,000-fold reduction in the release of MHV-A59 virions and concommitantly blocks the completion of the O-glycosylation of the E1 viral envelope glycoprotein, as we have shown here. Why the transport of MHV-A59 particles from the budding compartment to the Golgi apparatus and thence out of the cell is so very much more cold sensitive than the transport out of the rough ER of the envelope glycoproteins of VSV and SFV remains to be explained. Possibly the difference stems from the fact that in one case it is whole virions which are being transported and, in the other, viral glycoproteins inserted into cellular membranes.",
