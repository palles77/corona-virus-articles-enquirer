The native S1 gene was modified at A + T abundant regions; n.t. 777-1683, n.t.1041-1050, n.t.1236-1248, n.t.1317-1335, n.t.1590-1605; based on the same amino acid sequences. The modified gene was cloned into a yeast expression vector pPIC9K. The resultant plasmid pPIC9K-S1 was transformed into Pichia pastoris GS 115 and the protein expression was induced with methanol. SDS-PAGE confirmed that the recombinant SI was secreted in the supernatant of induced GS 115. The protein yield reached 69 mg/l. ELISA and Western blot demonstrated that the S1 could react with the convalescent sera of people infected by SARS-CoV. Furthermore, ligand blot assay showed that the recombinant S1 could react with ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV. The molecular mass of expressed S1 was about 70 kDa, which was higher than that of the 30 kDa expected. PNGase F deglycosylation resulted in a protein band of 30 kDa. In conclusion, the S1 gene modification rendered the high-level expression of S1 in P. pastoris GS 115 and the protein was secreted as a biologically active form which was hyperglycosylated.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV is tentatively classified into group IV coronavirus because of its low homology of the genomic sequence with those of other coronaviruses. However, like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV enters host cells by binding the Spike (S) protein to its cellular receptors [4] [5] [6] . S protein belongs to class 1 transmembrane glycoprotein and can be divided into S1 and S2 fragments by its structure although it does not experience cleavage. S 1 is situated in the N terminal and responsible for the binding to cellular receptor, while S 2 is situated in the C terminal and responsible for the fusion with cellular membrane [7] . The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the major cellular receptor of SARS-CoV, [4, 5, 8] . The receptor-binding domain of S 1 was determined to be within the region of 318-510 amino acids (AA) [9] . Meanwhile, this region includes several linear and conformation-dependent epitopes to neutralization antibodies [10, 11] . Therefore, S 1 plays an important role in SARS-CoV-mediated infection and transmission. Additionally, S1 is a key vaccine antigen for the control of SARS-CoV-mediated infection. However, SARS-CoV is one of the human viruses which are highly restricted for the purpose of research because of the biosafety issue. The cloning and in vitro expression of S1 may provide an alterative approach to study the virus pathogenesis and infection control.",

Like higher eukaryotic expression systems, P. pastoris expression system undergoes posttranslational modifications such as disulfide bond formation, proteolytic processing, and glycosylation [12] . We ever cloned S1 gene fragment (n.t.777-1683) including receptor binding domain into a P. pastoris expression vector pPIC9K but failed to express it. More recently, S1 was successfully expressed in P. pastoris expression system with much lower efficiency compared to the E. coli system [13] . Sequence analysis of the native S1 gene excluded the code bias problem in yeast. However, it was found that many A + T repeats exist at regions of n.t.1041-1050, n.t.1236-1248, n.t.1317-1335, and n.t. 1590-1605, Socrer et al. demonstrated that the A + T abundant regions may act as a polyadenylation loop in P. pastoris and result in improper termination of transcription of HIV envelop glycoprotein gp120 [14] . To test the hypothesis that the A + T abundant regions may impede the expression of S1 in P. pastoris system, S1 gene was modified to remove the A + T repeats but keep the correct codons for translation. As a result, this modification enabled the high expression of S1 in P. pastoris.",

P. pastoris produces foreign proteins with high efficiency either intracellularly or extracellularly. Furthermore, this yeast expression system performs many eukaryotic posttranslational modifications such as processing of signal sequences, folding, glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, and proteolytic processing [12] . Expression vectors based on the methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter are integrated into the host chromosome. However, there are some disadvantages which impede the heterologous protein expression such as the codon bias, A + T composition of cDNA, glycosylation patterns, etc. High-level expression of genes in P. pastoris prefers a lower ratio of A + T and the third nucleotide of C for a trinucleotide codon. A + T rich sequence lowered transcriptional efficiency because of the transcriptional blocks [18] . For instance, AT-rich regions such as 5\u00a2-ATTATTTATAAT-3\u00a2 in the gene of HIV-1 gp120 resulted in premature transcriptional termination and the production of truncated mRNA. When G + C content was increased by synthesizing the gene, this transcriptional problem was overcome giving rise to full-length mRNA [14] .",

            "text": "In our previous study, we failed to detect expression of SARS-COV S1 gene fragment (n.t 777-1683) which includes the receptor-binding region (n.t. 954-1530) [9] . Later we realized that this fragment had abundant AT repeats and some of AT-rich regions even span more than 7 nucleotides. Therefore it was assumed that this AT-rich sequence might result in an undesirable termination of S1 gene transcription by acting as a polyadenylation loop in P. pastoris. Based on the same meaning of the native codons, we changed A or T to G or C as much as possible at four sites with over 7 nucleotides of A + T repetition. As a consequence, this modification of S1 gene rendered its high-level expression in P. pastoris with the yield of 69 mg/l. The Fig. 4 ELISA detected the reaction of S1 protein expressed by the recombinant yeast with convalescent sera of the SARS patients. S1 was coated on ELISA plates and reacted with the sera. Bar 1, 2 represented the sera from two SARS convalescent patients respectively; Bar 3-6 represented sera from four healthy people, respectively. The OD value for each bar represented the mean of three independent experiments. The error bars represented the standard deviation (SD) Viru Genes (2006) 33:329-335 333 expressed S1 was functionally demonstrated by its reaction with antisera to SARS-CoV and the receptor ACE2 (Figs. [3] [4] [5] . These evidences support our assumption that high content of A + T in heterologous genes impedes the expression in P. pastoris. One of the advantages for P. pastoris expression system is that the expressed protein can be glycosylated. However, the glycosylation patterns differ between yeast and mammal expression systems [19] . Although able to add both O-and N-linked carbohydrate moieties to secreted proteins, P. pastoris glycosylated a heterologous protein by adding Olinked and N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides. Some of foreign proteins appear to be hyperglycosylated with outer chains of 50-150 mannose residues in length [12] . The native S protein of SARS-CoV is a highly-glycosylated protein with high mannose and/or hybrid oligosaccharides, and our S1 protein fragment includes four N-glycosylation sites located in residues 269, 318, 330, and 357, respectively [20, 21] . The hyperglycosylation of S1 protein secreted by the recombinant P. pastoris was confirmed by PNGase F deglycosylation. PNGase F is an amidase, which cleaves between the innermost G1cNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose, hybrid and complex oligosaceharides from N-linked glycoproteins. Therefore PNGase F hydrolyzes nearly all types of N-glycan chains from glycopeptides/proteins. After PNGase F deglycosylation, the high molecular mass (70 kDa) of S1 protein was degraded to the expected size of S1 (30 kDa). Unlike the SDS-PAGE result, we detected two bands on NC membrane when the antisera to SARS-CoV were used to probe the degraded S1 protein in Western blot analysis. Because the recognition site of PNGase F is located between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose, it would be possible that the other 40 kDa band was the oligosaccharide cleaved by PNGase F which could be recognized by antisera to SARS-CoV but not detected by protein stain Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 3) .",
