Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed ~96% genomic similarity with bat CoV (RaTG13) and clustered together in phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, RaTG13 also showed 97.43% spike protein similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that RaTG13 is the closest strain. However, RBD and key amino acid residues supposed to be crucial for human-to-human and cross-species transmission are homologues between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin CoVs. These results from our analysis suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus of bat and pangolin CoVs. Moreover, this study also reports mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes signifying its aptitude for evolution. In short, our findings propose that homologous recombination has been occurred between bat and pangolin CoVs that triggered cross-species transmission and emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and, during the ongoing outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is still evolving for its adaptability. 2019).

The viruses are further classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronavirus (King et al., 2012) . So far, all coronaviruses (CoVs) identified in human belong to the genera alpha and beta. Among them betaCoVs are of particular importance. Different novel strains of highly infectious betaCoVs have been emerged in human populations in the past two decades that have caused severe health concern all over the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was first recognized in 2003, causing a global outbreak (Zhong, 2004; Peiris et al., 2004; Cherry, 2004) . It was followed by another pandemic event in 2012 by a novel strain of coronavirus designated as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2013) . Both CoVs were zoonotic pathogens and evolved in animals. Bats in the genus Rhinolophus are natural reservoir of coronaviruses worldwide, and it is presumed that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been transmitted to human through some intermediate mammalian hosts (Li et al., 2005a; Bolles et al., 2011; Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2014 The large trimeric spike glycoprotein (S) located on the surface of CoVs is crucial for viral infection and pathogenesis, which is further subdivided into N-terminal S1 subunit and C-terminal S2 domain. The S1 subunit is specialized in recognizing receptors on host cell, comprising of two separate domains located at N-and C-terminal which can fold independently and facilitate receptor engagement (Masters, 2006) . Receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of most CoVs are located on S1 C-terminus and enable attachment to its host receptor (Li et al., 2005b) . The host specificity of virus particle is determined by amino acid sequence of RBD and is usually dissimilar among different CoVs. Therefore, RBD is a core determinant for tissue tropism and host range of CoVs. This article presents SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic trees, comparison and analysis of genome, spike protein, and RBD amino acid sequences of different CoVs, deducing source and etiology of COVID-19 and evolutionary relationship among SARS-CoV-2 in human.",

In the phylogenetic tree, strains of SARS-CoV-2 (red colored) are cluster together and belong to the genera Betacoronavirus. Among Beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV, Civet SARS CoV, Bat SARS-like CoVs, bat/RaTG13 CoV, and SARS-CoVs-2 clustered together forming a discrete clade from MERS-CoVs.

Regardless of low homology between SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1_MN908947) and SARS-CoV (SARS_AAR07630), they had many homologues areas in S-protein. The five key amino acid residues of S-protein at positions 442,472, 479,480, and 487 of SARS-CoVs are described to be at the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor complex interface and supposed to be crucial for human to human and cross-species transmission (Li et al., 2005b; Wu et al., 2012) .

Mutation in encoding segments of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from public-domain databases were investigated. In comparison with the first reported SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1_MN908947), amino acid substitutions were observed at 87 positions of SARS-CoV-2 open reding frames (orfs) (Figure 3) . Total number of amino acid substitution in corresponding orfs are listed in Table 2 . Among different orfs of SARS-CoV-2, orf1a was most variable segment with total number of 44 .

It was followed by spike segment S orf with 13 amino acid residue substitutions. However, orf6 and orf7b are the most conserved regions without amino acid changes. In addition, orf10, E, M and orf7a have tended to be more conserved, with only one or two amino acid substitutions.",

Usually, RNA viruses have high rate of genetic mutations, which leads to evolution and provide them with increased adaptability (Lin et al., 2019) . To further explore SARS-CoV-2 evolution in human, we have performed phylogenetic analysis based on the aforementioned SARS-CoV-2 in correspondence with their amino acid substitution. Figure   4 . illustrates the phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 and associated amino acid changes. Our phylogenetic tree demonstrates that BetaCoV/Chongqing/YC01/2020 is the closest SARS-CoV-2 to bat CoV (Bat/Yunnan/RaTG13) as compared to the first reported SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1_MN908947). Taking BetaCoV/Chongqing/YC01/2020 as a reference group, South Korea SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/South_Korea/SNU01/2020) has 7 amino acid substitutions in six orfs (S, E, orf1a, orf31, and orf8). BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH-001/2020 has total of 16 amino acid substitutions in four coding regions with highest substitution of 11 amino acid residues in orf1a.

Our finding suggest that pangolin is the most possible intermediate SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, which may have given rise to cross-species transmission to humans. These new findings suggest further research to investigate pangolin as a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. Another important outcome of our analysis is the genetic mutations and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as it spread globally. These findings are very significant for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",
