            "text": "Methods for translating gene expression signatures into clinically relevant information have typically relied upon having many samples from patients with similar molecular phenotypes. Here, we address the question of what can be done when it is relatively easy to obtain healthy patient samples, but when abnormalities corresponding to disease states may be rare and one-ofa-kind. The associated computational challenge, anomaly detection, is a well-studied machinelearning problem. However, due to the dimensionality and variability of expression data, existing methods based on feature space analysis or individual anomalously expressed genes are insufficient. We present a novel approach, CSAX, that identifies pathways in an individual sample in which the normal expression relationships are disrupted. To evaluate our approach, we have compiled and released a compendium of public expression data sets, reformulated to create a test bed for anomaly detection. We demonstrate the accuracy of CSAX on the data sets in our compendium, compare it to other leading methods, and show that CSAX aids in both identifying anomalies and explaining their underlying biology. We describe an approach to characterizing the difficulty of specific expression anomaly detection tasks. We then illustrate CSAX's value in two developmental case studies. Confirming prior hypotheses, CSAX highlights disruption of platelet activation pathways in a neonate with retinopathy of prematurity and identifies, for the first time, dysregulated oxidative stress response in second trimester amniotic fluid of fetuses with obese mothers. Our approach provides an important step toward identification of individual disease patterns in the era of precision medicine.",

Precision diagnostics based on expression array signatures are increasingly moving into the clinic (Mehta et al., 2011; Glas et al., 2006) . However, methods for designing microarray-based diagnostics or discovering disease subtypes require a reasonable number of samples representing each patient class (Slonim, 2002) . There are techniques for boosting the signal when relatively few samples are available (Tusher et al., 2001; Dougherty, 2001) , but these don't eliminate the need for a representative set of samples that fully characterize the molecular variability underlying the phenotypes of interest. For rare diseases or genetically heterogeneous disorders, another analysis paradigm is needed. Here we demonstrate that by characterizing the expression patterns of ''normal'' samples, it is often possible to identify abnormal samples even when each abnormality is one-of-a-kind.",

We characterize the classes of anomalies we can expect to detect, and we discuss how clinical intuition might be applied to identify anomalies suitable for these methods.

FRaC learns relationships among gene expression in the training data and measures their reliability. It uses those models to estimate the likelihood of test set expression. The extent to which a test set gene's expression is considered anomalous is measured by the log-loss of its likelihood, according to those models. Anomaly scores for samples are computed by summing anomaly scores over all genes.

CSAX's most anomalous pathway across all src samples is ''NCAM signaling for neurite out-growth,'' with a median rank of 2, meaning that this pathway was ranked either first or second in at least half the bagging trials. The next two top pathways, both with median rank 3, were ''Signaling by FGFR'' and ''Downstream signaling of activated FGFR.'' FGFR signaling is mediated by src (Sandilands et al., 2007) . NCAM binds to FGFR-1, and its role in cell migration depends on both FGFR-1 and src activation (Francavilla et al., 2009) , showing that src activation in the anomalous samples produces anomalous gene sets reflecting the direct effects of src expression. These low median rank scores suggest that there is remarkable consistency across the different test samples.",

We therefore suspected that it would be impossible to predict abnormalities accurately given the normal amniotic fluid data, and that the presence of preterm complications could be predicted with only moderate accuracy. This hypothesis proved correct. The preterm data set had a CSAX AUC of 0.606 (compared to 0.580, 0.498, and 0.574 with LOF, SVM, and FRaC, respectively); the amniotic fluid data, a CSAX AUC of 0.534 (compared to 0.572, 0.534, and 0.540 with LOF, SVM, and FRaC, respectively). Yet despite the limited overall prediction accuracy, we found the gene sets CSAX highlighted for individuals or groups of samples to be very informative. 3.3.1. Blood from preterm neonates. Only a single neonatal sample had retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) but no other complications. The top gene sets in this sample, with median ranks of 1 and 2 respectively, were ''platelet degranulation'' and ''platelet activation.'' ROP, which can lead to vision defects and even blindness, is caused by disordered retinal vascularization. There is an ongoing debate in the literature about whether platelets play a role in the pathogenesis of ROP and what that role might be ( Jensen et al., 2011; Vinekar et al., 2010) . Our observation of disrupted expression relationships among genes involved in platelet activation in an individual with ROP may provide valuable evidence about the molecular mechanisms of this process. Our samples also included 14 infants with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), a type of ischemic brain injury that can lead to cerebral palsy. Glutamate-mediated defects in calcium signaling play a significant role in oligodendrocyte damage in PVL (Butt, 2006) and offer the potential for protective therapeutic intervention (Follett et al., 2004) . CSAX highlighted dysregulation of calcium signaling or homeostasis pathways in six individuals with PVL. Such analyses may not only confirm the role of these pathways, but could identify individuals who might be candidates for treatments targeting this process.",

The ApoD protein has been demonstrated to regulate inflammatory response (Do Carmo et al., 2008) and to exert neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects in a rodent model of excitotoxic brain injury, possibly by protecting against oxidative stress (He et al., 2009; Franz et al., 1999; Bajo-Graneras et al., 2011) . However, until now, the link between increased expression of APOD and increased oxidative stress in second trimester fetuses of obese women has been only speculative; traditional analyses of these same samples sought but did not find evidence of this connection.

FRaC learns reliable relationships between genes' expression patterns from the training data, and identifies anomalies when these patterns break down. This method is therefore entirely data-driven; it does not rely on prior knowledge about gene sets. Yet it makes sense that many clinically important conditions would be characterized by a breakdown in the expected relationships between genes' expression patterns. So it is perhaps not surprising that FRaC is particularly effective.",

We find it revealing that CSAX also outperforms the simple combination of running enrichment analysis on the FRaC anomaly scores (''FRaC + enrichment''). This result suggests that CSAX's bagging and weighting steps succeed in providing the desired robustness.",

If the anomalous samples are likely to be no more different from the normal samples than the normal samples are from each other, no method is likely to succeed.
