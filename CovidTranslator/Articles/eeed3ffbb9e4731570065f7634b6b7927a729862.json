Six topics were addressed in detail by speakers and workshop participants and are reported in a series of six reports. This workshop report, the second in the series, provides recommendations for current and future use of nonanimal methods and strategies for veterinary vaccine potency testing. Workshop participants recommended that future efforts to replace animal use give priority to vaccines (1) that use large numbers of animals per test and for which many serials are produced annually, (2) that involve significant animal pain and distress during procedures, (3) for which the functional protective antigen has been identified, (4) that involve foreign animal/zoonotic organisms that are dangerous to humans, and (5) that involve pathogens that can be easily spread to wildlife populations. Vaccines identified as the highest priorities were those for rabies, Leptospira spp., Clostridium spp., Erysipelas, foreign animal diseases (FAD), poultry diseases, and fish diseases. Further research on the identification, purification, and characterization of vaccine protective antigens in veterinary vaccines was also identified as a priority. critical knowledge and data gaps, including opportunities to apply new science and technology. Recommendations included (1) investigations into the relative impact of various adjuvants on antigen quantification assays, (2) investigations into extraction methods that could be used for vaccines containing adjuvants that can interfere with antigen assays, and (3) review of the current status of rabies and tetanus human vaccine in vitro potency methods for their potential application to the corresponding veterinary vaccines. Workshop participants recommended enhanced international harmonization and cooperation and closer collaborations between human and veterinary researchers to expedite progress. Implementation of the workshop recommendations is expected to advance alternative in vitro methods for veterinary vaccine potency testing that will benefit animal welfare and replace animal use while ensuring continued protection of human and animal health.",

However, the testing necessary to ensure vaccine effectiveness and safety can involve large numbers of animals and significant pain and distress. In the United States, the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) and the National Toxicology Program Interagency Center for the Evaluation of Alternative Toxicological Methods (NICEATM) promote the scientific validation and regulatory acceptance of test methods that accurately assess the safety of chemicals and products while reducing, refining (less pain and distress), and replacing animal use. Accordingly, NICEATM and ICCVAM recently identified vaccine potency and safety testing as one of their four highest priorities [1] .",

For example, analysis of serials released in the UK between 2007 and 2009 indicated that potency tests involving live challenge testing for Leptospira spp. and rabies vaccines accounted for a high proportion (>25%) of animals used in batch potency testing [14] . Vaccine challenge tests that require live viruses and bacteria that are hazardous to laboratory workers, livestock, companion animals, and wildlife were also considered high priorities (e.g., rabies and FMD vaccines). In addition, prioritization of vaccines for which the functional protective antigen has previously been identified would greatly facilitate the successful development of antigen quantification methods. Finally, new vaccines were included as high priorities in order to encourage the development of replacement alternatives early in the development cycle.",

The successful transition from an in vivo assay to an in vitro ELISA was aided by the fact that there was a strong correlation between antigen content and antibody response. The antigen-specific antibodies correlated with protection, and the European NDV vaccines were a homologous group with a single serotype and comparable oil-based adjuvants. Even with these distinct advantages, the replacement test took almost 10 years (1997-2006) to be incorporated in the EU monograph for inactivated Newcastle vaccines [18, 88, 90, 91] . Although publication in the EU monograph is encouraging, the in vitro assay is only optional because it is one of several approved assays for inactivated Newcastle vaccines currently included in the monograph. Accordingly, it is difficult to estimate how widely this or any other replacement assay is used by vaccine manufacturers to release vaccine products. Table 2 provides specific examples of potency tests for inactivated veterinary vaccines that do not require the use of animals. This is not an exhaustive list, and in some cases general methods are available, often without detailed methodologies. Adding to the complexity, these references do not clearly indicate what assays are being used to release a product. Nor do they indicate that multiple methods may be available and approved for a specific vaccine by a specific regulatory agency.",

Typically, in vivo potency tests evaluate the protective or immune response to the complete vaccine, including antigenic material (e.g., adjuvants, excipients). However, many typically use adjuvants such as mineral oil and aluminum salts, which may interfere with in vitro quantification methods. Therefore, these adjuvants would need to be separated from the antigen component of the vaccine before in vitro potency testing. Because the adjuvant is a critical component for developing the appropriate protective response for inactivated vaccines, additional in vitro tests may be required to ensure their quality. Regardless, when antigen quantification methods are being developed, the effect of an adjuvant on the immunogenicity of the protective antigen will also need to be investigated [18, 88, 91] . In addition, the effect of the inactivant on in vitro potency methods must be investigated.",

Recently implemented reduction and refinement alternatives to this test include (1) the use of a single-dilution vaccination (reduction) [53] that results in a significant reduction in animal usage to approximately 60 mice per test and (2) the incorporation of earlier humane endpoints of paresis, paralysis, and convulsions (refinement) [52] .",

According to the European Pharmacopoeia, the RFFIT may be used after a correlation has been established with the mouse vaccination-challenge in vivo test. A recent study demonstrated good correlation between results from the RFFIT and the traditional in vivo challenge assay [55] . The RFFIT is also reproducible within and between laboratories, providing a potential alternative to the mouse vaccination-challenge assay [22, 56] . In fact, the European Pharmacopoeia recently published a revised draft monograph incorporating the RFFIT potency assay for inactivated rabies vaccines for veterinary use [53] . Considering these recent developments, workshop participants recommended a focused international workshop to discuss the barriers to international implementation of the RFFIT.",

The FDA has approved the replacement of several animal-based immunogenicity assays with ELISA-based potency assays for some vaccine products, but this does not include human rabies vaccines [19] . At issue is the fact that, although the neutralizing antigens are well defined, a clear correlation has not been demonstrated among the amount of antigen required to induce immune response in animals, the amount of antigen measured using alternative in vitro assays, and the immune response in human vaccines [19] .

A focus on inactivated vaccines for rabies, Leptospira spp., and Clostridium spp. diseases was generated from this debate. An important outcome of this workshop was the recommendation for a similar international workshop to specifically discuss the development, validation, and implementation of alternative reduction, refinement, and replacement potency testing assays for rabies vaccines for both human and veterinary use. This workshop is currently scheduled for October [11] [12] [13] 2011 in Ames, Iowa.",

Based upon these criteria, the highest-priority vaccines were identified as those for rabies, Leptospira spp., Clostridium spp., erysipelas, foreign animal diseases (e.g., FMD), poultry diseases, and fish diseases.
