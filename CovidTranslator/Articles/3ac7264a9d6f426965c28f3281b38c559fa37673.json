            "text": "Effusions are commonly encountered in veterinary practice and often assist in determining a definitive diagnosis. The term effusion describes inappropriate accumulation of fluid within a body \"potential\" or \"third\" space outside of vascular or lymphatic conduits and visceral structures. These are often disclosed on physical examination; for example, overhydrated skin turgor and thickened lip folds, conjunctivae, tarsal webs, or scrotum may indicate localized edema or whole-body edema (i.e., anasarca); joint cavity distention indicates joint effusion often associated with arthritis; dyspnea and/or tachypnea, muted lung sounds, or cough may indicate pleural effusion; irregular femoral pulses, pulses alternans, and muted cardiac sounds concurrent with a jugular pulse may indicate pericardial effusion; and slippery visceral surfaces or a ballotable fluid wave may indicate abdominal effusion. Unfortunately, some effusions evade detection until imaging studies (radiography, ultrasonography) disclose their presence. Furthermore, centripetal adiposity can be confused with abdominal effusion but is easily differentiated on ultrasound examination. Collection, physicocytologic characterization, and chemical evaluation of effusions are crucial for accurate categorization. Classification schemes incorporating these features direct differential diagnoses considering the associated disease pathomechanisms.",

A 1-inch, 23-to 20-gauge needle, over-the-needle Teflon catheter, or butterfly needle-catheter is recommended. Fluid analysis usually requires a minimum of 3 to 5 ml of fluid. If ultrasound guidance is used, it is important to prevent sample contamination with ultrasound gel that induces artifacts (i.e., blue-appearing smudges on Diff-Quik or Wright-Giemsastained preparations). Aspiration methods should relieve negative pressure during needle withdrawal from the site of sample collection to avoid collection of contaminating and irrelevant tissues (cells).",

The urinary bladder should be emptied before the procedure, particularly when 14-gauge catheters are used. In patients with tense abdominal distention, the abdomen is punctured laterally to avoid gravitational ventral midline seroma formation and adhesions associated with ovariohysterectomy. If septic peritonitis is suspected but unproven with routine abdominocentesis, a fourquadrant tap can be performed. Ultrasonographic guidance is helpful for sampling loculated fluid or fluid collecting in the abdominal gutters. Usually a 22-to 20-gauge, 1-inch needle or Teflon catheter is attached to extension tubing. Mobility afforded by the extension tubing helps avoid visceral laceration should the patient move during the centesis procedure. Alternatively, a butterfly catheter set is used. If an abdominal effusion is difficult to sample, a 14-gauge Teflon catheter is used to puncture the abdomen, and a closed-ended polypropylene Tomcat catheter is inserted through its lumen. The Teflon catheter provides a \"sterile stent\" through which the Tomcat catheter may be manipulated as the patient's position is altered. Local anesthesia (lidocaine block) may be needed in some patients to enable nonpainful abdominocentesis.",

            "text": "Pericardiocentesis \u2022 Before pericardiocentesis, samples of blood are used to determine baseline packed cell volume (PCV), total solids (TS) concentration, platelet count, and activated coagulation time (ACT). This procedure is best performed with the patient in sternal recumbency and with local analgesia block. The site of thoracic penetration is surgically prepared and blocked with local anesthetic, and a small incision is made in the skin to facilitate movement of the catheter through the dermis. The right side is preferred to avoid large coronary arteries on the left side. However, echocardiography should assist in determining the optimal site for pericardiocentesis. Without access to echocardiography, the site selected corresponds to the palpable cardiac beat or just caudal to or below the elbow at the level of the costochondral junction (fifth to sixth intercostal space). The catheter is usually passed through the fifth or sixth right intercostal space (i.e., the cardiac notch between lung lobes) after local anesthetic is injected to the level of the pleura. A 12-to 16-gauge, 4-to 6-inch over-the-needle Teflon catheter is used with two or three extra holes aseptically snipped in the lateral aspect of the catheter approximately 1.5 to 3.0 cm from the tip. Extension tubing and a three-way stopcock are necessary in medium-and largesized dogs. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is simultaneously recorded while the catheter is advanced; touching the myocardium elicits premature ventricular beats. Ultrasound guidance is routinely used for this procedure. Pleural effusion is usually present and first encountered, typically a modified transudate, amber to slightly red in color. Entrance into the pericardium may require an acute thrust associated with a \"pop,\" after which the catheter is slipped over the needle into the pericardial sac, and the needle removed and discarded. Collection of a hemorrhagic effusion is typical and necessitates immediate differentiation of centesis fluid from peripheral blood using comparisons between each fluid in PCV, platelet count, TS concentration, and supernatant color, and an ACT on the fluid to confirm its inability to clot. These assessments avoid inadvertent removal of large volumes of intracardiac blood. Pericardial hemangiosarcomas may initiate a hemorrhagic effusion upon pericardiocentesis that may be difficult to differentiate from iatrogenic cardiac puncture. Ultrasonographic imaging may assist in resolving this conundrum. Complications associated with pericardiocentesis include ventricular premature contractions, laceration of the coronary artery, and sudden death. After removal of pericardial fluid, the patient should be monitored for arrhythmias and acute recurrence of hemorrhagic tamponade (abrupt onset of tachycardia, poor pulse quality, pulsus paradoxus, tachypnea).",

Very-small-volume samples may yield falsely low cell counts as a result of anticoagulant dilution. Poor sample mixing, sample contamination, prolonged storage, and medical therapy may each influence cell counts. Differential counts are best performed from concentrated cellular components. This can be simply done by sample centrifugation, smear preparation, and Diff-Quik staining. Smears of unconcentrated fluid allow estimation of cell numbers when cell counts exceed 1000/\u00b5l. At least six slides of collected fluid should immediately be made, rapidly air-dried to preserve cell morphology, and stained using a modified Wright stain such as Diff-Quik.

            "text": "Diagnostic considerations in animals with suspected abdominal effusion encompass a wide spectrum of disorders (see Figure 10 -4). Pure transudates are typically associated with severe hypoalbuminemia (see Chapter 12; see also and are usually caused by PLN, PLE, hepatic failure, protein loss from exudative cutaneous lesions, repeated body cavity lavage, or repeated largevolume or therapeutic abdominocentesis of a largevolume effusion. Anorexia and emaciation alone do not produce hypoalbuminemia severe enough to elicit edema or effusion. Important rule outs include causes of pathologic proteinuria (see Chapter 7) and hepatic insufficiency (see the discussion of bile acids in Chapter 9). Because PLE may occur without signs of enteric disease, enteric biopsy may be needed for diagnosis. Adjunctive scrutiny of the serum cholesterol concentration (see Chapter 8) is helpful in differentiating the cause of a pure transudate associated with hypoalbuminemia: PLE and hepatic failure usually cause hypocholesterolemia, whereas PLN usually causes hypercholesterolemia. The contribution of portal hypertension as an important pathomechanism of abdominal effusion can be discerned by calculating the serum albumin-effusion albumin (SA-EA) gradient, defined by the serum albumin concentration minus the ascitic fluid albumin concentration. Finding an SA-EA value greater than 1.1 indicates that portal hypertension has played an etiopathologic role in that patient's effusion. The gradient correlates directly with only a single physiologic variable (portal pressure) as compared to the ascites fluid total protein concentration which is influenced by serum protein concentration as well as portal pressure. This ratio is not affected by diuresis, paracentesis, or type of hepatic disease causing portal hypertension, and has a higher utility than traditional effusion classification schemes for differential diagnosis of the cause of effusion in human patients. 42 The utility of the SA-EA gradient has also been examined in dogs. 38 Noteworthy is that detection of portal hypertension with the SA-EA gradient is not synonymous with a diagnosis of hepatic failure, as there are numerous disorders (Figure 10-10; see also Figure  10 -4) that can lead to prehepatic, hepatic (presinusoidal, sinusoidal, post-sinusoidal), or post-hepatic portal hypertension. Considerable overlap of SA-EA gradients has been shown in humans and animals for different disorders. In the absence of liver-related causes, malignancy is the second most important cause of an increased SA-EA gradient and portal hypertension. Differential diagnosis of causes of abdominal effusion is best done considering collective physical findings and diagnostic features (Table 10-3) .",

Splenic and other abdominal masses (i.e., neoplasia, sepsis should be given intravenous antimicrobials before surgery and intraoperatively; a combination of metronidazole, enrofloxacin, and ticarcillin is recommended. Positive culture results should be reconciled with the antimicrobials in use and the regimen tailored appropriately. Animals with abdominal contamination secondary to surgery or iatrogenic infections (e.g., contamination during paracentesis) should have antibiotic therapy tailored to results of culture and sensitivity; these cases have higher risk for resistant nosocomial pathogens. Infections with fungal agents may also underlie exudative effusions. Fungal cultures should be considered in animals with body cavity effusions characterized as granulomatous and in animals with unexplained effusions within geographic find (e.g., Nocardia and Actinomyces). Therefore all exudative effusions should be cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacteria (see Chapter 15) . Samples should be immediately submitted in sterile clot tubes or transferred to appropriate transport medium. If samples in transport medium cannot be immediately submitted, they should be refrigerated to slow bacterial growth to avoid medium substrate use and microbe death. Finding irrefutable evidence of an infectious organism may indicate a need for emergency exploratory surgery. However, animals with suppurative cholangitis or hepatitis may be placed at great risk by surgical exploration that will have no direct survival benefit (aside from tissue biopsy and culture). Animals with obstructive biliary disorders associated with preparations or examination of centrifuged fluid sediment increases the likelihood of finding malignant cells. Sometimes neoplastic cells are only found using sediment derived from large volumes (e.g., >50-ml samples) of effusion. It is important to remember that \"reactive\" mesothelial cells resemble carcinoma cells and may be erroneously classified without immunocytochemical or immunohistochemical investigations. Ultrasonography can aid in aspiration of mass lesions for cytologic evaluation that may yield a more diagnostic population of cells for definitive identification. Chylous abdominal effusions usually suggest intestinal lymphangiectasia; lymphoproliferative disease of the gut, mesenteric lymphatics, or lymph nodes; intraabdominal neoplasia \"strangulating\" the mesenteric root; or idiopathic disease (these may be malformations). Rarely, vitamin E-responsive steatitis or biliary cirrhosis has accompanied feline chyloabdomen (see Figure 10 -4). While small lymphocytes are the initial cell type associated with chylous effusions, neutrophilic inflammation becomes established with chronicity. Repeated largevolume removal of chylous effusions depletes systemic protein concentrations (i.e., chyle contains 1 to 6 g protein/dl), further disrupting Starling's forces that may with spontaneous or \"field\" FIP were shown in one study to help distinguish FIP-affected cats from cats with similar clinical signs. 15 Unfortunately, not all cats with FIP have raised AGP values. The total nucleated cell count in body cavity effusions from cats with FIP is highly variable, ranging from 1000 to 30,000 cells/\u00b5L. Cytology reveals nondegenerative neutrophils as the predominant cell type and numerous macrophages and variable numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Inconsistencies in signs and clinical pathologic findings in FIP-affected cats (see Chapter 15) makes conclusive diagnosis impossible in cats with atypical features (e.g., long-term survival, modified transudative effusions) without immunocytochemistry or immunohistochemistry using anti-Coronavirus antibody.

Severe acute hemorrhage not caused by thrombocytopenia initially increases the platelet count. An ACT and buccal mucosal bleeding time (BMBT) (see Chapter 5) detect many hemostatic defects; BMBT is only pursued in animals with an adequate platelet count (>100,000/\u00b5l). Samples for effusion characterization should be obtained before initiating fluid or blood replacement therapy. Thoracic radiographs may reveal pleural fluid, lymphadenopathy (e.g., sternal lymph node), or frank metastasis. Ultrasonography may discover vascular tumors, usually associated with hepatic or splenic hematomas, and may disclose augment further fluid accumulation. Secondary infections are rare in animals with chylous effusions because chyle imparts a bacteriostatic influence. Animals with chyloabdomen should be evaluated for pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and metastatic neoplasia by thoracic radiography. Ultrasonography may reveal mesenteric root masses or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Hemoabdomen may be associated with trauma (e.g., ruptured spleen or hepatic parenchyma; avulsed renal pedicle or mesenteric vessels), vascular neoplasia (e.g., hemangiosarcoma, other vascular tumors, or tumors with necrotic centers such as hepatomas and hepatocellular carcinomas), increased hepatic fragility as occurs in feline hepatic amyloidosis, or coagulopathies (see Chapter 5; see also . Physical examination usually reveals abrasions or pain in traumatized animals, with follow-up radiographs sometimes disclosing broken bones. Inspection for signs of bleeding or coagulopathy should include detection of petechiae (e.g., fundic examination, mucous membranes), rectal and fecal examination looking for melena or hematochezia, palpation for hemarthrosis (i.e., swollen, painful joints), and urinalysis looking for hematuria. Without history or physical findings suggesting trauma, a complete blood count (CBC), including a area of leakage for best assessment owing to the propensity for omental encapsulation of the most diagnostic fluid (i.e., bile particulates, bacteria). Uroabdomen occurs when urine leaks and pools within the peritoneal cavity. Affected animals may appear to void normally if the rent reflects a single ruptured ureter or when bladder avulsion surrounded by a fibrous tract provides a voiding conduit. Avulsion of a ureter at the renal pedicle may cause retroperitoneal effusion. Trauma is the major cause of urinary system leakage, but cystocentesis, traumatic diagnostic cystoscopy, or neoplasia may also be causal factors. The degree of azotemia varies depending on severity and chronicity of urinary leakage into the abdomen. If virtually all urine accumulates in the abdomen, rapid-onset azotemia and hyperkalemia are expected. Most patients develop a vaguely painful abdomen, lethargy, fever, and dehydration. Some animals develop pathologic arrhythmias associated with electrolyte aberrations (i.e., severe hyperkalemia and acidosis). Markedly increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentrations, hyperphosphatemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis are expected. The effusion is slightly turbid, blood tinged, and yellow. Fluid creatinine concentration is markedly higher relative to peripheral blood, whereas there may be no substantial difference between fluid and serum urea nitrogen concentrations. The small size of the urea molecule allows rapid systemic dispersal in body water, negating its diagnostic utility in uroabdomen. Ultrasonography or an IV urogram (followed by a retrograde urethral cystogram as necessary) usually locates the damaged area. Diagnosis may be more descriptive if contrast studies use CT. Urinary drainage and abdominal lavage rapidly correct electrolyte and acid-base derangements if surgical intervention is delayed.",

Biliary tree leakage may be immediate or delayed after blunt or surgical injury (see Table 10 -4). Affected animals may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Symptomatic patients demonstrate variable low-grade abdominal pain, lethargy, fever, and jaundice associated with a mild to modest abdominal effusion and may have concurrent bacterial contamination. Patients with aseptic bile peritonitis may be asymptomatic with the exception of jaundice and equivocal cranial abdominal discomfort. Clinical signs may correlate with the extent/severity of bile leakage (e.g., experimentally, the lethal dose of sterile bile injected intraperitoneally into dogs ranged from 20 to 30 ml/kg body weight). Pale or acholic feces indicate deviation of bile from the intestines (extrahepatic bile duct obstruction or severe small bile duct \"ductopenia\" as develops in cats with immunemediated cholangiohepatitis). Serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities and total bilirubin concentrations are invariably increased. Appearance and severity of jaundice depend on underlying cause and severity and chronicity of bile leakage. Bile induces a chemical peritonitis associated with cytokine release and alterations in fluid transport across peritoneal membranes. Cell membranes exposed to high concentrations of bile acids (functionally acting as detergents that disrupt cell membranes), bilirubin, and lysolecithin develop leaky gap junctions permitting translocation of enteric bacteria and endotoxin, leading to endotoxemia and/or septic peritonitis. Focal bile peritonitis may be restricted by omental adhesions to biliary structures. These present as pericholecystic effusions or effusions within the porta hepatis on ultrasonography. Cautious targeted aspiration using a spinal needle and ultrasonographic guidance may successfully collect diagnostic fluid in these cases. A ruptured gallbladder may be indicated by its sudden absence on ultrasound evaluation. In some cases, ultrasound imaging can identify the location of bile leakage (i.e., focal fluid accumulation, hyperechoic foci, adhesions, loss of normal gallbladder wall layering). Focal ileus of small intestine or colon may be identified adjacent to a site of biliary rupture, reflecting chemical peritonitis. Bile peritonitis is cytologically characterized by high numbers of neutrophils and macrophages and the presence of free and phagocytized bile (see Figure 10 -3). The fluid specimen is often turbid with a golden-brown or golden-green color. A higher bilirubin concentration relative to peripheral blood is found.

The most common neoplasm causing pleural effusion in dogs and cats is mediastinal lymphoma. In dogs, lymphocytes are the predominate cell population and these may lack obvious malignant characteristics. Aspiration of mediastinal masses or lymph nodes or other more accessible enlarged nodes may be diagnostic. In cats, exfoliated lymphoblasts are common. It is important to differentiate thymomas from lymphoma, as the former may have a better prognosis. Differentiation of thymoma from lymphoma may require tissue sampling. Malignant or benign best detected with the patient laterally recumbent. This represents an exaggerated change in arterial pressure during respiration: fall in pressure during inspiration and stronger pulse during expiration that coordinate with exaggerated right atrial and ventricular filling during inspiration and reduced stroke volume from reduced left ventricular volume. Pericardial effusion is usually associated with pericardial irritation and inflammation, neoplasia causing hemorrhage, or central venous congestion. Animals with congestive cardiomyopathy may have small to moderate amounts of pericardial fluid that can lead to diagnostic confusion in delineating the cause of clinical signs. Pericardial effusion is associated with a severe globoid or round enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with the size increasing with the volume of accumulated effusion (large size with chronicity, perhaps near-normal shape and size with rapid onset). The caudal vena cava, an important capacitance vessel, is usually large on the lateral thoracic radiograph reflecting hepatic congestion and hepatomegaly due to passive congestion. Pleural effusion and evidence of metastatic disease may be apparent. Edges of the cardiac silhouette may appear unusually \"sharp\" due to decreased motion artifact associated with the diminished cardiac contraction. 46 Abdominal radiographs may disclose hepatomegaly or reduced abdominal detail due to ascites derived from severe passive congestion (right-sided congestive heart failure) caused by pericardial tamponade. Sinus tachycardia is a common electrophysiologic finding along with low-voltage QRS complexes (50% of dogs with pericardial effusion). Electrical alternans (cyclic change in R-wave amplitude) reflects motion of the heart suspended in the pericardial sac. Finding a normal ECG does not dismiss pericardial effusion from considered differential diagnoses. The gold standard for diagnosing pericardial effusion is echocardiography; effusion in the pericardial sac is obvious and can be identified by entry-level ultrasound operators. Fluid volumes as small as 10 to 15 ml can be detected using ultrasonography. Diastolic collapse of the right atrium or ventricle is a classic feature. 46 Mass lesions may be identified but often require an operator with specialized training. A cavitated mass associated with the right atrium is highly consistent with hemangiosarcoma, the most common neoplasm in large-breed dogs associated with pericardial tamponade linked with a hemorrhagic/ xanthochromic effusion. Small hemangiosarcomas located beyond the echocardiographic \"window\" may remain undetected.",

Modified transudates are found with idiopathic pericarditis, rightsided heart failure, pericardial cysts (congenital malformations), uremic pericarditis, and syndromes associated with vascular leakage. Exudates are found with FIP and bacterial or fungal pericarditis. Septic pericarditis is rare but has been reported secondary to migrating grass awns. Apparent chylopericardium also is rare but may develop secondary to mediastinal venous hypertension derived from cardiomyopathy. Trauma, neoplasia, coagulopathy, or rare spontaneous left atrial rupture can cause hemopericardium. Pericardial tamponade is most common in dogs and is most often associated with a total accumulated volume. Rapid accumulation of volumes as small as 25 to 100 ml can abruptly cause tamponade, whereas slower accumulations can generate volumes as large as 2 L in large-breed dogs (which are most commonly affected) before onset of clinical signs. Dogs with chronic pericardial effusion eventually demonstrate clinical signs consistent with right-sided heart failure: lethargy, exercise intolerance, tachypnea, weight loss, and abdominal distention. Signs are progressive in development concordant with fluid accumulation that exceeds compliance of the pericardial sac. Dogs with acute symptomatic pericardial effusion present with acute collapse, syncope, or weakness precipitated by physical exertion and require emergency pericardiocentesis. The clinician should look for jugular pulse, pulsus paradoxus, hepatojugular reflex, poor femoral pulse quality, muffled cardiac sounds, exercise intolerance, and physiologically inappropriate tachycardia consistent with pericardial tamponade or restrictive pericardial disease. Hepatojugular reflex is elicited by applying gentle abdominal compression to liver or cranial abdomen for 10 to 15 seconds (increases venous return to the heart) and observing jugular vein distention or pulsation (indicating reduced right heart function or filling). Hepatomegaly caused by venous congestion may be difficult to palpate because of abdominal distention due to ascites formation or secondary to patient conformation (deepchested dog).

Synoviocytes modify synovial fluid, provide viscous hyaluronic acid for joint lubrication, remove large molecules (i.e., plasma proteins), and participate in maintenance of articular cartilage. Synovial fluid, a plasma ultrafiltrate enriched with viscous hyaluronic acid important for joint mobility, nourishes articular cartilage and functions as a boundary lubricant for periarticular tissues. 32 Synovial effusions reflect cartilage injury secondary to degenerative joint disease, trauma, immunemediated mechanisms, and infection. On injury, chondrocytes and synoviocytes release cytokines that induce vasodilation of subsynovial capillaries leading to enhanced vascular permeability and extravasation of protein and inflammatory cells into the joint space. Inflammation is fostered by accumulated leukocytes and release of degradative enzymes and mediators from multiple cell types. Number and cellular composition of leukocytes infiltrating the synovium and migrating into synovial fluid determine characteristics of a joint effusion and clinical features of associated arthritis. Generally, arthropathies are considered inflammatory or degenerative, exudative or transudative, septic or nonseptic, hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic, and erosive or nonerosive, and are cytologically classified similar to other body cavity effusions with additional assessment of joint fluid viscosity.",

Normal joint fluid has one to three nucleated cells per high-power field (400\u00d7) where each nucleated cell represents approximately 1000 cells/\u00b5l; less than 10% of cells are neutrophils and these have a normal cytologic appearance. The remaining cells (90%) consist of small lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and a few synoviocytes. Phagocytosed cytoplasmic debris is common in joint fluid from animals with degenerative joint disease and resolving or chronic inflammation. Infectious agents, including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, are sometimes found within macrophages in septic arthritis. Infrequent but informative cells in different disorders include multinucleated giant cells, osteoclasts, ragocytes, and lupus erythematosus (LE) cells. Multinucleated giant cells are rarely observed but represent fusion macrophages; these have multiple round to oval nuclei in a gray granular cytoplasm and may demonstrate phagocytosed debris or organisms.",

Increased total protein, fibrin, and coagulation proteins may cause joint fluid to clot on collection if it is not promptly placed in an EDTA tube. While highest cell counts are encountered with septic effusions, there is broad overlap in neutrophil counts among dogs with septic and immune-mediated arthritis. Neutrophilic inflammation may also be seen in joints affected by degenerative arthritis with as many as 12,000 cells/\u00b5l and up to a 56% distribution of neutrophils.

Noninflammatory arthritides (i.e., degenerative joint disease, traumatic joint injury, hemarthrosis, neoplastic joint conditions) are often characterized by low-grade synovial mononuclear inflammation. Fluid analysis may be normal or show only minor changes: mild vasodilation may slightly increase fluid volume and total protein content, causing mild dilution or no change in hyaluronic acid and fluid viscosity, and a normal or fair mucin clot test. Color of joint fluid in these conditions varies from clear and light yellow to bloody or xanthochromic, reflecting intraarticular hemorrhage. Total nucleated cell counts may be normal to mildly increased but are rarely greater than 5000 cells/\u00b5l. Cytologic features include a predominance of monocular cells and a normal to slightly increased number of neutrophils; total and differential cell counts must be reconciled with blood contamination. Mononuclear cells may appear enlarged and have an abundant foamy vacuolated cytoplasm consistent with phagocytic activity. Traumatic or coagulopathic hemarthrosis often produces erythrophagocytosis and hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Cartilage fragments, chondrocytes, and osteoclasts may indicate severe cartilage damage. Diagnosis of degenerative osteoarthritis is made by reconciling physical findings, radiographic images, and synovial fluid analyses.

Rheumatoid arthritis is classically considered erosive. Nonerosive arthritides are more difficult to definitively diagnose and categorize. SLE and arthritis associated with a variety of underlying diseases are most common. Ragocytes, LE cells, or both indicate immunemediated disease (Figure 10-17) . Submission of sera for antinuclear antibody (ANA) and RF titers (see Chapter 12), blood for an LE cell prep, and synovial biopsies for histologic evaluation may implicate immuno-destructive processes. Chronic, progressive feline polyarthritis usually occurs in males and has two forms. A periostealproliferative form is most prevalent, primarily affecting young adult cats causing tenosynovitis followed by nondeforming periarticular periosteal proliferation and subchondral bone erosions. A deforming or rheumatoid-like arthritis form has an insidious onset in older cats where common causes (Box 10-5). Iatrogenic overhydration does not typically induce marked generalized edema unless another underlying factor (e.g., hypoalbuminemia, anuria/oliguria) coexists, an inappropriately large volume of fluids has been administered, or a concurrent disease condition or drug therapy has stimulated ADH release. Iatrogenic fluid overload imparts generalized edema associated with an obvious change in skin turgor (e.g., jelly-like consistency); morbidly obese patients have the highest risk when calculation of maintenance fluid requirements is based on gross body weight. Overhydration typically resolves within 48 hours of discontinuing fluid administration, although animals demonstrating cough or tachypnea may benefit from short-term furosemide administration. Animals with a normal serum albumin concentration that are highly sensitive to iatrogenic fluid overload may have incipient cardiac disease (e.g., high-output cardiac failure associated with severe anemia, chronic valvular insufficiency), anuric/oliguric renal failure, or disease processes or drug therapies stimulating excessive ADH release (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [SIADH]).",

Forces maintaining homeostatic balance of fluid distribution between the intravascular plasma volume and the interstitial fluid space are referred to as Starling's forces. Finding edema or anasarca signals imbalance of Starling's forces favoring fluid distribution into the interstitial compartment: (1) reduced colloid oncotic pressure (i.e., decreased plasma proteins), (2) altered hydrostatic pressure (i.e., opposing pressures within the interstitium and vasculature) favoring interstitial fluid accumulation, (3) reduced vascular integrity (i.e., leakiness of veins, arteries, capillaries, lymphatics), and/or (4) increased pathophysiologic signals conserving systemic water and sodium (e.g., enhanced angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone [ADH] elaboration, systemic or splanchnic hypotension). To determine the cause of regionalized or local edema, consideration must be given to local anatomy of vasculature and soft tissues and the presence of local inflammatory, structural, or neoplastic conditions.

Total body water retention secondary to SIADH (see Chapter 6) usually coexists with another disorder that overshadows its presence. SIADH is also induced by several drug therapies. With hypoalbuminemia, fluid retention is aggravated by sodium and water retention driven by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as occurs in severe renal, hepatic, or cardiac disease. Systemic hypertension often reflects abnormal activity of this system. History, physical examination, serum albumin determination, thoracic radiographs, cardiac evaluations (i.e., ECG, echocardiography), systemic blood pressure, CVP determination (not routinely used), urinalysis, abdominal ultrasonography, and CT imaging assist in identifying the cause of anasarca (see Figure 10 -19) . Finding a jugular pulse or abnormal hepatojugular reflex suggests intrathoracic disease within the cranial mediastinum or involving the heart or pericardium. If an underlying cause is not found, physical examination and laboratory data are reviewed looking for evidence of vasculitis (i.e., petechiation, microvascular lesions on fundic examination, microscopic hematuria, schistocytes on blood smear).

Although clinical presentations are quite variable, most cats with FIP are chronically ill with systemic signs, hyperglobulinemia (i.e., \u22655 g/dl), and a highprotein abdominal effusion (i.e., >3.5 g/dl). Evaluation of the effusion by protein electrophoresis may assist in achieving a diagnosis; one study demonstrated that finding greater than 32% gamma globulins in effusions with a total protein greater than 3.5 g/dl had a 100% positive predictive value for FIP in a suspect population of cats.47 Estimation of acute phase proteins also may be helpful. Concentrations of \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP) greater than 1.5 g/L in plasma, sera, or effusion from cats regions where endemic fungi are recognized (e.g., Southwest United States for Coccidioides; regions where blastomycosis or histoplasmosis are common).Exudates without cytologic evidence of sepsis necessitate review of history for trauma and possible urinary, biliary, or cyst rupture(Table 10-4; see also Figure 10-4). Neutrophilic abdominal effusion can persist for weeks after blunt abdominal trauma or surgery. Radiography of bony structures sometimes reveals evidence of injury. If trauma is considered unlikely, physical assessments should be made looking for other evidence of inflammation. In cats, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) must be BOX 10-2.

Sudden detection of a cardiac murmur may herald the onset of infectious endocarditis and should be explored with echocardiography. Many dogs with septic joints have minimal or no degenerative neutrophils or negative cultures due to concurrent antibiotic therapy. Some infectious agents may not cause degenerative neutrophil changes and are not cytologically detectable (e.g., mycoplasma, rickettsia, L-form bacteria, viruses [calicivirus in cats, postvaccinal arthritides]). A pyogranulomatous response is usually associated with fungal and bacterial L-form infections (L-forms are bacteria lacking cell walls). Ehrlichia morulae are only found in very small numbers of neutrophils (~1%) in synovial fluid during the acute stages of infection. Protozoa (e.g., Leishmania), fungal hyphae (i.e., Aspergillus), or yeast forms (e.g., Blastomyces) of fungi causing systemic infections also may be observed in synovial fluid macrophages. Feline polyarthritis (i.e., chronic progressive polyarthritis) is statistically linked with feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infections. Viral-induced arthritis may present either as a mild or marked mononuclear effusion, as observed in feline calicivirus or as a suppurative response. Omphalophlebitis may be the source of infection in neonatal animals. Serologic testing for borreliosis (i.e., Lyme disease) may help diagnose inflammatory arthritis of unknown cause (see Chapter 15",
