The efficiencies of two viral RNA extraction methods (liquid phase partition and silica-based adsorption chromatography) and the effects of handling and storage on the stability of RNA isolated from dengue virus (DENV) were studied. Viral RNA extracted from spiked sera or clinical samples characterized with DENV infection were quantified by TaqMan real-time PCR. The presence of high serum proteins severely affected the recovery of DENV RNA by the liquid phase partition, but not the silica-based method. The recovery with Trizol liquid phase partition method was significantly improved by a concomitant addition of a co-precipitant and the reduction of sera proteins, resulting in recoveries similar to that of the silica-based methods. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles did not affect the recovery of viral RNA. While intact DENV was found to be stable in serum for up to 2 hour at 25\u00b0C, recovery of viral RNA from sera stored in the lysis/ binding buffer was stable for up to 5 days. These data indicate that the choice of viral RNA extraction methods , the conditions for handling , and storing of clinical sera critically affect the quantification of viral nucleic acid from clinical samples. This will impact the accuracy and reproducibility of DENV diagnosis by PCR-based assays.",

Various commercially available viral RNA extraction methods are currently in use for clinical diagnostics of viral diseases. These extraction kits are generally based on two methods-liquid phase partition (eg, TRIzol LS) and silica-based nucleic acid adsorption chromatography (eg, High Pure Viral RNA and QIAamp Viral RNA kits). The recoveries of viral RNA by these two methods differ substantially with different viruses, 6 -12 thus making the choice of any particular method for the isolation of viral RNA uncertain. While there were several studies on the isolation and stability of other viruses, few reports have focused on the systematic evaluation of the stability and recovery of DENV RNA from sera. [13] [14] [15] This study examined the contributions of various pre-analytical variables to the sensitivity of DENV RNA detection in serum. Using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), critical pre-analytical variables, including the performances of commercially available liquid phase partition and silica-based viral RNA extraction methods and the effects of storage, handling and freeze/ thaw on the stability of the DENV RNA in serum were investigated.",

The inclusion of linear acrylamide into the sera however significantly improved the recoveries of viral RNA ( Figure 1B) . To test the hypothesis that serum proteins contribute to the poor recovery of RNA, DENV, or viral genomic RNA were spiked into varying dilutions of serum or different amounts of hSA, and the extractions were performed using TRIzol LS with linear acrylamide. The results indicated an inverse linear relationship between the recoveries of RNA and the increase in sera protein concentration for both DENV (r 2 \u03ed 0.993 and 0.963 for sera and hSA respectively; Figure  1C ) and viral genomic RNA (r 2 \u03ed 0.990). Consistent with previous reports, the PFUs were significantly lower than RNA copy numbers. 22, 23 We next explored the use of silica filter-based adsorption of nucleic acids for the extraction of viral RNA from biological fluids. The recoveries of RNA from DENV and viral genomic RNA samples were comparable between the two silica-based kits assessed, and were efficient as compared with the controls (Figure 2, A and B) . Remarkably, the silica-based method did not show preferential binding for higher molecular mass RNA and was also efficient in recovering small RNAs (0.28 kb) (Figure 3 , A-C). The recovery of RNA from serum was however found to be statistically lower ( Figure 3D ) as compared with extraction from PBS, consistent with the results on The asterisks denote statistical significance (Tukey's test, *P \u03fd 0.01, **P \u03fd 0.005) in the amount of viral RNA recovered compared with the control RNA. C: Viral RNA was isolated from either virus (DENV-2, 10 4 PFU/ml) or DENV-2 genomic RNA (10 6 copies/ml) using TRIzol LS reagent with the linear acrylamide additive, in the presence of varying dilutions of normal human serum (50 mg/ml total protein) or human serum albumin (hSA). The asterisks denote statistical significance (paired Student's t-test, *P \u03fd 0.01) in the amount of viral RNA recovered from samples with high protein content (50 mg/ml) as compared with the control RNA. The isolated viral RNA was assayed using the Roche TaqMan RNA amplification kit in parallel with the genomic viral RNA standards. The control reference is the amount of viral RNA obtained from the direct lysis method. The experiments were performed in quadruplicates and assayed in duplicates. The data are expressed as mean \u03ee SEM.",

However, the DENV-2 virus was relatively more stable in serum at 25\u00b0C over a longer period of time. To simplify sample handling, while maintaining and prolonging viral RNA integrity before extraction, the feasibility of using the same lysis/binding buffer of the extraction kit, which contain chaotropes, 27 to store DENV-containing samples was examined.

Additionally, since it is common for patient sera to undergo cycles of freeze-thaw in retrospective studies, the effects of repeated freeze-thaw cycles on DENV RNA recovery and integrity were also examined.
