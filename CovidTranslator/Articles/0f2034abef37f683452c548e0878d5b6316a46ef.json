New diseases have emerged from industrial pollution and HIV, while better imaging has revealed others previously unrecognized. Scientific advances in microbiology, imaging and clinical measurement have improved diagnosis and allowed better targeted treatment. Advances in treatment have been dramatic, the most important being drugs (antibiotics, cortisone, b 2 -adrenoreceptor agonists), ventilatory support (from iron lung to nasal positive-pressure ventilation), inhaled therapy (metered dose inhalers, nebulizers) and lung surgery (resections, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, transplantation). Delivery of care has shifted from sanatoria for the rich but nothing at all for the poor, to hospitals and universal coverage. Generalists have turned into super-specialists and doctors have been joined by growing numbers of professions allied to medicine (PAMs). Management of lung disease has vastly improved but the impact of disease remains.",

Tuberculosis (TB) gave John Keats a far from easeful death in 1821 but provided Violetta in 1853 with the best last act of all in La Traviata.

The air became opaque with coal dust underground, while up above asbestos and other factory chemicals were inhaled, lingered in the lungs and slowly scarred them. New chapters were written into books of lung pathology, new X-ray patterns described. Asthma annoyed William of Orange and Charles Dickens but was never a 19th-century celebrity. However, 100 years later, with the help of Bill Clinton and David Beckham, it became a star; allergy replaced psychology as the cause, and big pharma smelt and dealt in gold. Sleep apnoea moved on from Dickens' fat boy snoring in the background to crest the wave of obesity and became the fastest growing branch of lung disease.",

Of course, it had never really left at all, surging on among the malnourished and overcrowded in poorer countries. Drug-resistant bacteria emerged and TB deaths rose again. Pneumonia, too, had never gone away. Osler in the 1920s named it the 'old man's friend' and may have been right for Donald Bradman in 2001 or Ronald Reagan in 2005. But pneumonia was no friend to the increasing numbers of immunocompromised individuals, their defences weakened by malnutrition (George Orwell in 'How the poor die'), cancer treatments or, from 1981, HIV (Freddie Mercury in 1991). Other viruses hit the headlines. Spanish flu killed 50 million people in 1918, and since then smaller flu epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome have shown that, in spite of vaccination, viruses are still very effective killers.",

Synthetic sulphonamides in the 1930s were toxic and unsuitable for systemic use. Moulds had been used to treat infections for centuries before Fleming investigated penicillin in 1928 (Poland, France, Italy, Belgium and Costa Rica can all claim to have got there first); Florey and Pfizer were essential in taking it on to manufacture in 1942. Then came streptomycin (1944), tetracycline (1945), choramphenicol (1947), erythromycin (1949), isoniazid (1952) and rifampicin (1957) . The transition from watching an infection to treating it was dramatic, and it must have been a wonderful era to be a doctor. Close behind came the miracle of cortisone. In 1949, patients with rheumatoid arthritis picked up their beds and walked, and the wonder drug began to cure all known diseases; recreational use led to cortisone parties in New York. By 1955, the benefits and adverse effects had been quickly established clinical observation e controlled trials take longer. Asthma attacks responded to treatment, and with inhaled corticosteroids came long-term control. Third prize goes to the b-adrenoreceptor agonists, first isoprenaline, then salbutamol and finally the long-acting badrenoreceptor agonists. Selective b 2 -adrenoreceptor agonists are among the world's best-selling drugs for asthma, COPD, sporting performance and beef production.",

In the 1980s, non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation took off, and devices have been improving ever since (Figure 2) , keeping hundreds of thousands of people alive who would, 100 years ago, have died.

Key were endotracheal intubation (1904), anaesthetic gases (chloroform 1847, halothane 1951), antisepsis (1870s), blood groups and safe transfusion (1901), antibiotics (1940s) and, most important of all, brave pioneers. Each new operation builds on the experience of others; artificial pneumothorax (1830s) moved on to thoracoplasty (1880s) and plombage (1920s). The first survival from pneumonectomy was in 1931; the next 16 patients died. Eventually, surgery for TB turned into lung cancer resection in the 1950s. Drainage of pleural fluid was routine from 1850 (Axel Munte describes draining an empyema in a pet ape during a home visit in The Story of San Michele in 1929). Thoracoscopy started in 1910 and advanced in the 1970s with fibreoptics. It has since developed into video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for investigation of pleural disease, lung biopsy, treatment of pneumothorax and simple resections. Lung transplantation opened new and wonderful prospects for endstage lung disease with the first successful operations in the 1970s and has now become routine, albeit limited by scarcity of donor organs.",

These were alongside but separate from hospitals and endured professional snobbery. General physicians looked down on chest physicians ('Chest e yes, physician e never') before the systems were integrated in the 1960s. Today, the lung specialist is often the best general physician. TB nurses morphed, after a brief spell in the wilderness, into respiratory nurses with their own training programmes. Some work in primary care and some are specialist nurses in hospitals and have been joined by respiratory therapists, specialist physiotherapists, lung function measurers, psychologists and the rest.
