NS2A displays both protein/protein and membrane/protein interactions, yet neither its functions in the viral cycle nor its active regions are known with certainty. To highlight the different membrane-active regions of NS2A, we characterized the effects of peptides derived from a peptide library encompassing this protein's full length on different membranes by measuring their membrane leakage induction and modulation of lipid phase behavior. Following this initial screening, one region, peptide dens25, had interesting effects on membranes; therefore, we sought to thoroughly characterize this region's interaction with membranes. This peptide presents an interfacial/hydrophobic pattern characteristic of a membrane-proximal segment. We show that dens25 strongly interacts with membranes that contain a large proportion of lipid molecules with a formal negative charge, and that this effect has a major electrostatic contribution. Considering its membrane modulating capabilities, this region might be involved in membrane rearrangements and thus be important for the viral cycle.",

For the best part of the last century, Dengue virus has been the most prevalent arbovirus affecting the human population. Once restricted to the tropics and subtropics, it is now spreading to previously unaffected zones, owing to the dispersion of its vectors, Aedes spp., driven by several factors, among them an ever-increasing global temperature and widespread traveling. Apart from that, the fact that the last year there were over 390 million estimated cases, 2 DENV is becoming a serious threat to public health. Although the most common clinical manifestations are asymptomatic or mild fevers that can be tackled with well-equipped hospitals, there are two other serious life threatening situations with mortality rates surpassing 20% if left unattended. 3 The fact that more than 40% of the world population lives in regions where Dengue vectors thrive, leaving close to 3 billion people at risk in the world, should not be overlooked. 4 Although several compounds have been identified to inhibit DENV replication, 5 there is actually no clinical treatment for its infection.",

            "text": "The DENV viral genome consists of a single strand of positive RNA that contains a single open reading frame, encoding a polyprotein of more than 3000 residues. After cleavage and maturation by several proteases, this protein gives rise to three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. 6 Similarly to other enveloped viruses, DENV enters the cells via receptor mediated endocytosis through clathrin coated pits. 6\u22129 Once inside the cell, its proteins rearrange cellular membranes that ultimately result in the formation of unique structures where the replication complexes are located. 10\u221212 A significant part of its viral cycle remains elusive, yet its proteins take part in protein\u2212protein and protein\u2212lipid interactions in a very intricate manner. 6, 9 Throughout all of its viral cycle, DENV is associated with membranes and all of its essential steps take place in membranes, especially endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Although the specific genome encapsulation, virion formation, and fusion processes are widely accepted to be almost exclusively carried through by the structural proteins C, prM, and class II fusion protein E, much is still being debated about the exclusivity of those proteins in those processes. 13\u221215 All the polyprotein processing and viral RNA replication steps are generally assigned to the nonstructural proteins, including the formation of replication complexes of the virus. 16 The accumulated knowledge on the functions of NS1, NS2A, NS4A, and NS4B on the viral cycle is very sparse, mainly due to their considerable hydrophobicity and the difficulty of discerning their exact roles. 17 NS4A and NS4B seem to be involved in the host's immune system evasion and immune response, affecting several pathways. 18, 19 Protein NS1 is found mainly in the cytosol of the cell, rendering it an ideal antigen for DENV infection detection, and seems to play a role in autophagy as well. 20 One of the proteins found in the replication complex of flaviviruses is NS2A, 16 what would certify its role in the viral replication. This protein is required for the proper processing of NS1, possesses specific recognition sites for certain proteases, is also involved in the interferon inhibition by NS4A and NS4B, and is mainly found in ER membranes. 18, 21, 22 Recently, a topology model was proposed where NS2A is described as having one N-terminal segment from residues 1 to 31 with no described membrane interaction, followed by a segment, residues 32\u221268, that despite lacking the ability to traverse the membrane is proposed to be in close association with it. 23 Two transmembrane segments ensue from residues 69 to 119, followed by a non-transmembrane segment from residues 120 to 142, and ending with three transmembrane segments from residues 143 to 209.",

We sought to highlight regions that could be important for proper NS2A function, since this protein, essential in the viral RNA replication process, is a poorly characterized highly hydrophobic protein that requires the membrane to perform its functions. Furthermore, DENV protein/lipid and protein/ protein interactions are thought to be therapeutic targets for DENV infection. From both of those points, we sought to highlight the membrane-active regions of this protein, identifying several regions with different interacting capabilities. Besides, we characterize a NS2A peptide, peptide dens25, with interesting properties on membranes. We resorted to several biophysical techniques, such as fluorescence spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), using several model membrane systems. These results possibly provide new therapeutic targets needed to develop new strategies to thwart this highly worrying public health problem. 55 from Dengue Virus Type 2 NGC NS2A protein (with N-terminal acetylation and Cterminal acetylation) and a purity greater than 95% was obtained from Genemed Synthesis, San Antonio, TX, USA.

As described elsewhere, only the outer bilayer leaflet was labeled with FPE. 42 LUVs were incubated with 0.1 mol % FPE dissolved in ethanol (never more than 0.1% of the total aqueous volume) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the dark. Unincorporated FPE was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with the appropriate buffer. FPE vesicles were stored at 4\u00b0C until use in an O 2free atmosphere. The fluorescence of FPE-labeled vesicles was measured after the desired amount of peptide was directly added into 400 \u03bcL of lipid suspension (200 \u03bcM lipid) using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 and 520 nm, respectively, with 5 nm slits. Temperature was maintained at 25\u00b0C throughout the experiment. Background scattering was subtracted from probe free samples. Data were fitted to a hyperbolic binding model 43 considering the following formulas,",

A sample volume of 25 \u03bcL prepared as stated above was placed between CaF 2 windows separated by 50 \u03bcm thick Teflon spacers in a liquid demountable cell (Harrick, Ossining, NY). The spectra were obtained in a Bruker IF66S spectrometer using a DTGS detector. Each spectrum was obtained by collecting 300 interferograms with a nominal resolution of 2 cm \u22121 . A fast Fourier transform algorithm with triangular apodization was applied, and a shuttle accessory was used to average both sample and background spectra in the same time frame. The spectrometer was continuously purged with dry air at a dew point of \u221240\u00b0C. Samples were equilibrated at the lowest temperature for 20 min prior to acquisition. An external bath circulator, connected to the infrared spectrometer, controlled the sample temperature. For temperature studies, samples were scanned using 2\u00b0C intervals and a 2 min delay. Data analysis methodologies were performed interactively using either GRAMS/32 or Spectra-Calc (Galactic Industriesm Salem, MA) as described elsewhere. 39, 44 \u25a0 RESULTS NS2A is a membrane protein with possibly five transmembrane domains and at least two membrane interacting regions. 23 NS2A, essential in the viral RNA replication, is undercharacterized possibly owing to its significant hydrophobicity. Therefore, a multitude of problems arise when trying to define structure, function, and lipid\u2212protein interacting regions. We have conducted a screening of membrane-active regions of DENV NS2A protein, relying on a peptide library that Averaged normalized water-to-membrane (solid line) and water-to-interface (dashed line) transfer free energy scales applied to 41 DENV NS2A primary sequences. The NS2A sequences pertained to DENV1 (02_20, 05K4147DK1, 297arg00, BIDV1323, BIDV1800, BIDV1841, BIDV1926VN2008, BIDV2143, BIDV2243VE2007 and ThD1004901), DENV2 (NGC, BIDV633, BIDV687, CSF381, CSF63, DakArD20761, DF707, DF755, MD1504, MD903, and MD917), DENV3 (05K797DK1, 07CHLS001, 98, 98TWmosq, BIDV1831VN2007, BIDV1874VN2007, BR29002, C036094, TB55i, and ThD31283_98), and DENV4 (2A, BIDV2165VE1998, BIDV2170VE1999, H241, rDEN4del30, Sin897695, ThD4047697, ThD4048501, Vp4, and Yama) strains. 24, 53 Transfer free energies (kcal/mol) were obtained from Wimley and White, 54 Engelman et al., 55 Hessa et al., 56 Moon and Fleming, 57 Meiler et al., 58 and Eisenberg et al. 59 Regions 1\u22128 23 represents the full length NS2A protein composed of 35 different overlapping peptides (Table 1) . Because the library includes the complete linear sequence of this protein and each individual peptide, i, overlaps with two and three consecutive peptides, i + 1 and i + 2, by approximately 11 and 5 residues, respectively, the obtained data should be analyzed considering the effect of protein segments rather than that of isolated peptides. Furthermore, we have performed a thorough Assuming the 3D organization of NS2A's amino acids as an \u03b1-helix and applying it to the whole sequence, 31 the respective average normalized water-to-membrane and water-to-interface transfer free energy scales for each of the residues and for 35 DENV NS2A strain specific sequences have been obtained ( Figure 1A ). Ten distinct regions having considerable hydrophobic and interfacial values throughout the protein sequence can be resolved: region a encompassing residues from 6 to 19, region b from 30 to 54, region c from 55 to 62, region d from 70 to 83, region e from 83 to 93, region f from 101 to 115, region g from 124 to 136, region h from 145 to 164, region i from 165 to 182, and region j from 192 to 211. Xie et al. 23 suggested the existence of eight different regions for the NS2B topology: regions 1 (residues 3\u221224), 2 (residues 32\u221251), and 5 (residues 120\u2212140) as peripheral segments and regions 3 (residues 69\u221293), 4 (residues 100\u2212118), 6 (residues 143\u2212 163), 7 (residues 165\u2212186), and 8 (residues 189\u2212209) as transmembrane segments (see Figure 1A) . Interestingly, regions a, b, and g coincide with regions 1, 2, and 5, whereas regions d\u2212e, f, h, i, and j coincide with regions 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Region c has both a lower intensity and a smaller length than expected to be considered as either a membrane interacting domain or a transmembrane segment. 31 The existence of pretransmembrane domains with a strong propensity for partitioning into membrane interfaces in different viral proteins is well-known. 31 These domains show characteristic high waterto-interface transfer free energies overlapping with high waterto-bilayer transfer free energies. Figure 1B shows the normalized water-to-bilayer and water-to-interface transfer free energies for NS2A region b encompassing amino acids 30\u221255 (the sequence is also shown). As observed, this segment has a significant high water-to-bilayer transfer free energy immediately followed by a region of high water-to-interface transfer free energy, a characteristic pattern of pre-transmembrane domains (so-called stem or membrane-proximal domains). This pattern is characterized by a strong propensity to partition into and interact with membrane interfaces, 25,45\u221252 suggesting that this segment might interact significantly with membranes. Region 2 is coincidental with region b, and has already been proposed to associate with the membrane. 23 It should not be ruled out that this domain's effect on membranes could be similar to other viral pre-transmembrane domains (see below).",

            "text": "The membrane leakage results for the NS2A peptide library are shown in Figure 2 . We have considered seven different lipid compositions, simple and complex: EPC (Figure 2A ), EPC/ Chol at a phospholipid molar ratio of 5:1 ( Figure 2B ), EPC/ BMP at a phospholipid molar ratio of 5:1 ( Figure 2C ), EPC/ BPI at a phospholipid molar ratio of 5:1 ( Figure 2D) , and EPC/SM/Chol at a phospholipid molar ratio of 5:2:1 ( Figure  2E ), whereas the complex ones consisted of an ER synthetic lipid mixture resembling the ER membrane ( Figure 2F ) and a lipid extract of liver membranes ( Figure 2G ). The leakage data showed that some peptides exerted a quite significant leakage effect with a minor dependence on lipid composition. The leakage effects were focused on two segments, one segment delimited by residues 25\u221241 corresponding to peptide 5 and a long segment delimited by residues 103\u2212183 (peptides 18\u2212 29). Leakage elicited by peptide 5 was remarkable in the presence of liver liposomes, since a leakage value of about 45% was observed ( Figure 2G ). Lower but significant values were found for liposomes containing BMP (about 18%, Figure 2C ) and ER-like membranes (about 10%, Figure 2F ). Leakage values elicited by peptides 18\u221229 were lower than that observed with peptide 5, oscillating between 10 and 20%. Apart from these differences, leakage induction was consistent throughout all liposome compositions used ( Figure 2 ). Interestingly, peptide 5 overlaps region b and peptides 18\u221229 overlap regions f, g, h, and i. Peptide 5 would be defined by a significant leakage value concurrent with high hydrophobicity and interfaciality (see above) and therefore would partition extensively to the membrane interface. 31 Phospholipids can undergo a cooperative melting reaction related to the increase in disorder of the lipid palisade; this melting process can be influenced by many types of molecules including peptides and proteins. To assess the influence of the NS2A peptide library on the structural and thermotropic properties of phospholipid membranes, we measured the temperature dependence of the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of the fluorescent probe DPH incorporated into model biomembranes (DMPC, Supplemental Figure 1 (Supporting Information), and DMPG, Supplemental Figure  2 (Supporting Information)). There were no significant changes in the T m values of DMPC in the presence of the NS2A derived peptides, but some of them, namely, peptides 2, 5, and 12, elicited a significant effect on anisotropy and cooperativity (Supplemental Figure 1 , Supporting Information). In the case of DMPG, there were more peptides affecting the thermotropic behavior of the phospholipid (Supplemental Figure 2 , Supporting Information). However, peptides 2, 5, 10, and 12 were the ones that showed a significant effect on the cooperativity, T m , and/or the anisotropy of DMPG. These data would suggest that these peptides should interact with membranes at a relative deep location, considering that DPH is known to locate inside the palisade structure of the membrane. The specific effect that these peptides have on DMPG does not seem to be exclusively electrostatic, since the net charges of peptides having a remarkable effect, i.e., peptides 2, 5, 10, and 12, are \u22122, +2, \u22121, and 0, respectively ( Table 1) .",

Furthermore, the region where peptide 5 resides has been proposed to bind to the membrane surface. 23 Therefore, we have carried out a thorough characterization of peptide dens25, corresponding to the NS2A segment comprised by residues 30\u221255 and its membrane interactions in order to assess the membranotropic character of this protein region. Since peptide dens25 lacks a Trp residue and therefore intrinsic fluorescence, we considered the FPE probe, 40 sensitive to the electrostatic surface potential, to detect the binding extension of the peptide to membranes with distinct lipid compositions and lipid/peptide ratios ( Figure 3A) . Peptide dens25 showed a higher affinity for model membranes composed of negatively charged phospholipids, as well as the complex ER and liver lipid membranes. The dependence of peptide binding on the membrane surface total charge is demonstrated by the linear dependence of FPE fluorescence and EPG content for membranes containing different lipid Figure 3A, inset) . A similar linear relationship is observed for EPC/BPS membranes (not shown). Interestingly, a lower affinity was observed for zwitterionic liposomes, i.e., those composed of EPC, EPC/ Chol, and EPC/SM/Chol ( Figure 3A ). All FPE binding data could be adjusted to either a sigmoidal (Hill coefficient of approximately 1) or a hyperbolic binding model, suggesting that the peptide might interact with membranes as a monomer.",

In order to discriminate between these possibilities, we have studied the contribution of ionic strength to the thermotropic phase behavior of the negatively charged phospholipid DMPG in the absence and in the presence of peptide dens25 by steady-state fluorescence anisotropy of the fluorescent probe DPH (Figure 4) . In the absence of salts, the transition of pure DMPG was a broad one ( Figure 4A ), as it has been noted before. 60 In the presence of peptide dens25 at a lipid/peptide molar ratio of 10:1, the anisotropy of DMPG increased significantly above T m ( Figure  4A ), but the cooperativity of the transition was similar to that found in pure DMPG ( Figure 4M ). When increasing concentrations of either NaCl (Figure 4C , E, G, I, and K) or KCl ( Figure 4D , F, H, J, and L) were added to pure DMPG, the cooperativity of the phospholipid increased. However, when dens25 was present, the cooperativity of DMPG increased steadily, although slightly, at increasing concentrations of either NaCl or KCl ( Figure 4M ). As observed in the figure, even at a concentration of 300 mM of either NaCl or KCl, the cooperativity was lower than that found for the pure phospholipid but higher than the cooperativity found at lower salt concentrations. These data would suggest that the interaction between the peptide and the negatively charged phospholipids would be mainly of an electrostatic nature. The difference of anisotropy in the absence and in the presence of peptide is shown in Figure 4N . It can be observed that the difference is inversely proportional to the salt concentration, being lower for NaCl than for KCl, which would indicate that not only an increase in ionic strength reduces dens25's effect on membranes but also there are subtle differences between the sodium and potassium ions.",

            "text": "The effect of peptide dens25 on the thermotropic phase behavior of different phospholipids was studied using DSC ( Figure 5 ). When properly hydrated and in the presence of salt, DMPC and DMPG display two endothermic peaks on heating, corresponding to the pretransition (appearing at about 12\u221214\u00b0C , L \u03b2\u2032 \u2212P \u03b2\u2032 ) and the main transition (appearing at about 23\u2212 24\u00b0C, P \u03b2\u2032 \u2212L \u03b1 ). Incorporation of dens25 into DMPC at a lipid/ peptide ratio of 10:1 elicited no noticeable effect on the thermotropic behavior of the pure phospholipid, neither at low nor at high ionic strength ( Figure 5A and B, respectively) . In contrast, the main transition of pure DMPG at 25 mM NaCl was apparently composed of two different peaks, which should be due to mixed phases ( Figure 5C ). Incorporation of peptide dens25 induced a significant lowering of the cooperativity of the transition, but no apparent changes to the number of peaks were clearly visible ( Figure 5C ). In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, the main transition of pure DMPG was composed of only one peak, as expected, showing a large cooperativity ( Figure 5D ). When dens25 was incorporated into the membrane, a broad main transition peak was observed, indicating a significant lowering in cooperativity ( Figure 5D ). The pattern observed at 300 mM NaCl for pure DMPG was similar to the one found at 100 mM NaCl, since only one very cooperative peak was observed ( Figure 5E and D, respectively) . The addition of peptide dens25 lowered the cooperativity of the main transition, but the width at 300 mM NaCl was narrower than that at 100 mM, indicating that an increase of NaCl concentration induced an increase in the cooperativity of its transition ( Figure 5D and E) . In the case of DMPS, a similar pattern was visible. In the presence of 25 mM NaCl, peptide dens25 induced a significant decrease in cooperativity in DMPS if compared to the pure lipid sample ( Figure 5F ), whereas in the presence of 100 mM NaCl the peptide barely affected the main transition of the phospholipid ( Figure 5G ). In the presence of 25 mM NaCl, 14BMP, a negatively charged phospholipid, presented two low-enthalpy peaks and one highenthalpy peak ( Figure 5H ). In the presence of dens25, two peaks were observed, a low-enthalpy peak and a high-enthalpy one, the latter displaced to lower temperatures when compared to the pure lipid. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, 14BMP presented a normal pattern, i.e., a low-enthalpy peak and a highenthalpy peak corresponding to the L c1 \u2212L c2 and L c2 \u2212L \u03b1 transitions ( Figure 5I ). Apart from abolishing the low-enthalpy peak, peptide dens25 did not exert any other significant effect on the high-enthalpy high-temperature peak ( Figure 5I ). These DSC data would suggest that peptide dens25 affects more significantly the phase transition of negatively charged phospholipids in the absence of salt, an effect that is significantly increased when the ionic strength is reduced; i.e., the less salt concentration, the bigger the effect dens25 has on negatively charged phospholipids.",

            "text": "To further explore the effects of peptide dens25 on different types of model membranes, we have studied the ester C\ue0c8O stretching band of DMPC and DMPG, which appears between 1745 and 1720 cm \u22121 in infrared spectroscopy ( Figure 6 ). The frequency maximum of the ester C\ue0c8O band of pure DMPC in the presence of 25 mM NaCl had two transitions, one at about 17\u00b0C and the other at about 23\u00b0C, coincident with the pretransition and main gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of the pure phospholipid ( Figure 6A ). When dens25 was present, the frequency of the ester C\ue0c8O band of DMPC displayed only one transition at about 24\u00b0C ( Figure 6A ). Nonetheless, its frequency maximum was higher in the presence of the peptide than in its absence, suggesting that the peptide increased the intensity of the 1743 cm \u22121 component relative to the 1727 cm \u22121 one; i.e., the quantity of non-hydrogen-bonded C\ue0c8O ester bands increased in the presence of dens25. 61, 62 In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, a relatively similar pattern was found for DMPC ( Figure 6B ). The frequency maximum of the ester C\ue0c8O band of the pure phospholipid displayed two transitions at about 16 and 24\u00b0C, i.e., the pretransition and the main phase transition ( Figure  6A ). In the presence of the peptide, the frequency of the ester C\ue0c8O band displayed two transitions, a broad one at about 16\u00b0C and a narrow one at 24\u00b0C. As before, its absolute frequency was higher in the presence of dens25 than in its absence; however, it was not as high as it was found in the presence of 25 mM NaCl (compare parts A and B of Figure 6 ). The frequency maximum of the ester C\ue0c8O band of pure DMPG in the presence of 25 mM NaCl displayed two transitions, a broad one at about 14\u00b0C and a narrow one at 23\u00b0C, coincident with the pretransition and main phase transition of the pure phospholipid in accordance with the DSC data ( Figure 6C ). Noteworthy is the result that the frequency of the ester C\ue0c8O band of DMPG in the presence of dens25 displayed no transition at all in the temperature range studied ( Figure 6C ). In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, the frequency maximum of the ester C\ue0c8O band of pure DMPG displayed two transitions, a broad one at about 14\u00b0C and a relatively cooperative one at 22\u00b0C, coincident with the pre-and main transition of the pure Figure 6C ). In the presence of the dens25 peptide, the frequency of the ester C\ue0c8O band displayed only a broad transition at about 24\u00b0C, in accordance with the calorimetric data ( Figure 6D ). Its absolute frequency was higher in the presence of the peptide than in its absence but at temperatures higher than the main transition ( Figure 6D ). All these data would suggest that dens25 affects the phase transition of DMPG, a negatively charged phospholipid, but not that of DMPC, a zwitterionic one, in the presence of relatively low concentrations of NaCl. Conversely, the interaction of peptide dens25 with DMPG is abolished at relatively high salt concentrations.",

The infrared amide I\u2032 spectra of fully hydrated dens25 in the presence of DMPC and 25 mM NaCl below and above the lipid's main phase transition temperature are shown in Figure 6A . At both temperatures, the amide I\u2032 band presented two bands appearing at about 1623 and 1648 cm \u22121 , the former with relative lower intensity than the latter. The bands at about 1623 and 1648 cm \u22121 arise from the presence of aggregated \u03b2 structures and mainly unordered and helical structures, respectively. 63, 64 Upon data fitting, the relative intensity of the 1648 cm \u22121 band was about 73% and about 27% for the 1623 cm \u22121 band. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl and below and above the main transition of the phospholipid, the amide I\u2032 band of dens25 presented a similar pattern, i.e., two bands at about 1648 and 1623 cm \u22121 , with relative intensities of 68 and 32%, respectively ( Figure 6B ). The infrared amide I\u2032 spectra of fully hydrated dens25 in the presence of DMPG and 25 mM NaCl below and above the main phase transition of the phospholipid are shown in Figure 6C . In this case and in contrast to the DMPC sample, the amide I\u2032 band of dens25 presented two bands with slightly different frequencies. These two bands have a maximum at about 1653 and 1626 cm \u22121 , and their relative intensities were about 85 and about 15%, respectively ( Figure 6C ). When 100 mM NaCl, both below and above the main transition of the phospholipid, the amide I\u2032 band of dens25 presented two bands, but their frequencies were slightly different than in the presence of 25 mM NaCl, about 1648 and 1622 cm \u22121 ( Figure 6D ). In this case, the relative intensities of these two bands were also different, since it was found that they were 68 and 32%, respectively. From this picture, it is quite obvious that, in the presence of DMPG and at low NaCl concentration, the secondary structure of dens25 is different from that at high NaCl concentration, and this one presents a similar pattern to that found in the presence of DMPC at both low and high salt concentration. Although aggregated structures and helical and disordered structures are present in all samples, the quantity of aggregated \u03b2 structures diminished dramatically; i.e., the relative amount of either helical or disordered or both increased in the presence of DMPG, a negatively charged phospholipid, and a low salt concentration.",

The dens25 peptide affected membrane stability, resulting in the release of CF, this effect being dependent on the lipid/peptide molar ratio and lipid composition. Interestingly, the highest CF release was observed for liposomes containing negatively charged phospholipids, whereas Chol induced lower leakage values. We have also shown that dens25 affected the steady state fluorescence anisotropy of DPH inserted into membranes, especially when those membranes were composed of negatively charged phospholipids. Significantly, the interaction of dens25 seemed to be of an electrostatic nature: the data indicated that the effect was inversely proportional to the salt concentration in the medium. Calorimetric experiments further corroborated these results, with peptide dens25 affecting more significantly the phase transition of membranes containing negatively charged phospholipids in the absence of salt, an effect that was significantly reduced when the ionic strength was increased; i.e., the less salt concentration, the bigger the effect dens25 has on negatively charged phospholipids. These results were also corroborated by the infrared analysis of the ester C\ue0c8O stretching carbonyl band of the lipids. In the presence of low salt concentrations, dens25 affected the phase transition of the negatively charged molecule, DMPG, but not the zwitterionic one, DMPC.

The secondary structure of the dens25 peptide was thus affected by its binding to the membrane, as it has been suggested for other peptides. 53, 65 Concomitantly, differences in the frequency of the carbonyl band of the phospholipids were observed, showing that peptide binding modulates phospholipid conformation.",

The effect elicited by peptide dens25 should be primarily due to the electrostatic nature of the phospholipids, i.e., charge, with a slight contribution of hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, peptide dens25 affects membranes at distinct levels, from the membrane surface down to the hydrophobic core. Its location should be at or near the membrane interface, affecting lipid fluidity, most probably having an in-plane orientation. Moreover, its interfacial properties suggest that this region could behave similarly to a pre-transmembrane domain partitioning into and interacting with the membrane depending on the membrane composition and/or other proteins, shifting between membrane bound and unbound conformations and thus affecting its membrane topology.",
