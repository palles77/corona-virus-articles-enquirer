Out of the 26 children with nosocomial ARTI, 5 (19.2%) had bronchitis which was found to be HBoV positive without co-detection of other viruses. The HBoV-positive children were aged 1.7 months to 43 months and their mean age was 13.7 months. Sixteen (100%) children had cough, 11 (68.8%) had wheezing, and 10 (62.5%) had fever.",

[2] In 2005, human bocavirus (HBoV) was discovered in the respiratory samples from Swedish children with respiratory tract infection caused by other unknown agents. [3] Based on the genetic sequence of HBoV, it is classifi ed as bocavirus genus and belongs to the family of parvoviridae. To date, HBoV has been found to circulate worldwide. Serological studies have revealed that antibody seroconversion to HBoV is common in the early childhood. [24] [25] [26] The pathogenic role of HBoV has not yet been proved by classical Koch's postulates because neither an in vitro culture of HBoV nor an animal mode of infection can be established. Two recent studies from Allander and coworkers [23, 27] suggested that HBoV signifi cantly correlates with acute wheezing, and that HBoV-related respiratory infection can elicit B cell immune response.",

Similarly, our present study found HBoV was detected in 5 (19.2%) of 26 inpatients who developed nosocomial ARTI. In 5 HBoV-positive children with nosocomial infection, 7 common viruses were not detected coincidently. Particularly 2 HBoV positive patients had HBoV detected only in their second samples collected during the episode of nosocomial infection; however, their fi rst controlled samples obtained at admission were HBoV negative.

HBoV can be found in respiratory samples from pediatric and adult patients, but mainly in children. [6, 16, 19, 34] Most HBoV-infected patients are younger than 5 years old. [6, 16, 20, 21, 35] In this study, HBoV-positive inpatients were younger than 4 years, as reported previously. Studies from Japan and America revealed that the HBoV-seropositive rate increases with age after 6 months and most children have been exposed to HBoV before school-age. [24, 25] We speculate that infants and young children are most susceptible to HBoV infection, but none of the neonates with pneumonia in our study was found to be HBoV-positive.

[10, 16, [20] [21] 23, 33, 35, 36] Since a few children had upper respiratory tract infection in our study cohort, we only observed that HBoV is associated with lower respiratory tract infection. Most of HBoV-positive children with CA infection suffered from acute wheezing, whereas all HBoV-positive children with nosocomial ARTI did not present wheezing. Whether other viruses especially rhinovirus we had not tested were co-pathogenic for our patients with acute wheezing deserves further investigation. Allander and colleagues [23] reported that HBoV was prevalent in 19% of children with acute wheezing but only 5% of the children had HBoV detected alone. We are not sure that HBoV is a major virus triggering acute wheezing for our children.",

[3, 11, 16, 19, 21] These fi ndings, however, is challenged by a recent study from Canada which reported that HBoV was detected in 13.8% of symptomatic children and 43% of asymptomatic children.
