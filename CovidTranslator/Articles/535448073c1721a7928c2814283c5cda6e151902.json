Many common approaches do not provide a good picture of the actual system behavior, because they neglect feedback loops, instabilities and cascade effects. The complex and often counter-intuitive behavior of social systems and their macro-level collective dynamics can be better understood by means of complexity science. We highlight that a suitable system design and management can help to stop undesirable cascade effects and to enable favorable kinds of self-organization in the system. In such a way, complexity science can help to save human lives.",

In fact, the number of crowd disasters and the overall number of fatalities are on the rise, probably as a result of the increasing frequency and size of mass events (see Fig. 1 ). The classical approach to the avoidance of crowd disasters is reflected in the concept of \"crowd control\", which assumes that it is necessary to \"make people behave\". The concept bears some resemblance to how police sometimes handle violent demonstrations and riots. For example, tear gas and police cordons are used with the intention to gain control over crowds. However, there is evidence that such measures, which are usually intended to improve the safety of the crowd, may also unintentionally deteriorate a situation. For example, the use of tear gas may have played a significant role in the crowd disasters in Lima, Peru [23] . Our approach in the following is to clarify the cause of crowd disasters and then to discuss simple rules to improve crowd safety, oriented at giving more control to the individuals (\"empowerment\"). This strategy can be best described as creating a system design (\"institutional setting\") enabling all individuals and stakeholders to make a beneficial contribution to the proper functioning of the system-here mass events.",

However, such views tend to blame the visitors of mass events, thereby preventing the proper understanding of crowd disasters and their avoidance in the future. In fact, social order will generally not break down during crowd disasters [24] and it has been found that extreme events may lead to an emergent collective identity that will result in increased solidarity with strangers [25] rather than the opposite.",

            "text": "1. The term \"pushing\" suggests that people are relentlessly pushing towards their destination, disregarding the situation of others. However, when the density in the crowd is very high, even inadvertent body movements will cause physical interactions with others. The forces transmitted by such involuntary body interactions may add up from one body to the next, thereby causing a situation where people are unintentionally pushed around in the crowd. This situation is hard to distinguish from intentional pushing. 2. Fatalities during a crowd disaster are often perceived as the result of a \"crowd crush\", i.e. a situation in which the pressure on human bodies becomes so high that it causes deadly injuries. Such a situation may arise in the case of a \"stampede\", i.e. people desperately rushing into one direction but then facing a bottleneck, such that the available space per person is increasingly reduced, until the density in the crowd becomes life-threatening. For example, the crowd disaster in Minsk, Belarus (1999) , was caused by people fleeing into a subway station from heavy rain. 3. Another explanation of crowd disasters assumes a \"state of (psychological) panic\", which makes individuals behave in an irrational and relentless way, such that people are killed. An example of this kind may be the crowd disaster in Baghdad, Iraq (2005) , which was triggered by rumours regarding an imminent suicide bomber. The assumption of mass panic interprets fatalities in crowd disasters similar to manslaughter by a rioting moban interpretation, which may warrant the use of tear gas or police cordons to control an \"outraged crowd\".",

            "text": "In sharp contrast to this, it turns out that many crowd disasters do not result from a \"stampede\" or \"mass panic\" [26] . Prior to 2007, crowd-flow theory generally assumed a state of equilibrium in the crowd, where each level of crowd density (1/m 2 ) could be mapped to a corresponding value of the crowd flow (1/m/s). This assumption turned out to be approximately correct for low-to-medium levels of crowd density. However, it was later found [27] that at very high density the crowd is driven far from equilibrium. In many cases, fatalities result from a phenomenon called \"crowd turbulence\", which occurs when the density in the crowd is so high that bodies automatically touch each other. As a result, physical forces are transmitted from one body to another-a process that is unavoidable under such conditions. These forces may add up and create force chains that cause sudden subsequent pushes from various directions, which can usually not be anticipated. Eventually, the individuals are pushed so much that one or some of them may stumble and fall to the ground. This creates a \"hole\" in the crowd, which breaks the balance of forces for the surrounding people: they are pushed from behind, but not anymore from the front, such that they are either forced to step on fallen persons (\"trampling\") or they will also fall. Due to this domino effect, such \"holes\" eventually grow bigger and bigger (a situation that may be coined \"black hole effect\"). This explains the phenomenon of piles of people, which are often identified as the causes of crowd disasters and interpreted as instances of trampling. Under such conditions, it is extremely difficult for individuals to get back on their feet and people on the ground eventually die of suffocation.",

Nevertheless, the method that is used to describe the free movements of pedestrians has little effect on the dynamics that emerge at extreme densities, since pedestrians movements are mostly unintentional in situations of overcrowding. Describing such situations we may thus use a generic component f 0 i describing how the pedestrian i would move under normal walking conditions.

The displacement of a pedestrian i is the change of location of that individual between two subsequent stops where the speed of i is less than 0.05 m/s. Simulations were conducted at a density of 6 pedestrians per m 2 , corresponding to a unidirectional flow of 360 pedestrians in a corridor of length 10 m and width 6 m with a bottleneck of width 4 m. Model parameters were set to k = 5 \u00d7 10 3 and the body masses m i were uniformly distributed in the interval [60, 100 kg] is particularly likely around bottlenecks, where local increases of the pedestrian density enhance the propagation of physical pressures from one individual to another. In particular, the unbalanced pressure distribution results in sudden stress releases and earthquake-like mass displacements of many pedestrians in all possible directions, which is well approximated by a power law with an exponent of 1.95 (see Fig. 2 ). This result is in good agreement with empirical observations of crowd turbulence, which exhibit a power law distribution with exponent 2.01 [27] .",

This includes institutional settings (e.g. spatial boundary conditions) and the way interactions between different stakeholders are organized.

In case of the reorganization of the annual pilgrimage in Saudi-Arabia (\"Hajj\"), for example, many elements were combined to increase the level of safety.

Hence, organizers of small-and intermediate-size events are often constrained to rely on their intuition and past experience to assess the safety of the events they are in charge of. However, the dynamics of crowd behavior is complex and often counter-intuitive. A systemic failure is usually not the result of one single, well-identifiable factor.

Even though this is a well-established fact in academic circles, it remains a frequent source of crowd disasters [26] . Likewise, the topology of the environment plays a crucial role to ensure a smooth flow of people. Avoiding bottlenecks is probably the most important recommendation. The problems implied by bottlenecks have been demonstrated with many computer simulations, regardless of the underlying model [28, 29, 32] . Bottlenecks exacerbate the physical pressure among neighboring individuals, and create the initial perturbations that might trigger crowd turbulence. Furthermore, bottlenecks produce long queues and excessive waiting times. Therefore, while people naturally keep reasonable distances between each other, they tend to become impatient and reduce inter-individual distances when their perceived progress towards the goal is too slow. This causes a vicious circle: The increasing local density reduces the flow through the bottleneck, and the reduced flow further increases the local density. Importantly, bottlenecks do not only result from the static environment, but can also be created dynamically by other external factors. Ambulances, police cars, people sitting on the ground, lost belongings, or temporary fences often create bottleneck situations that were not initially foreseen. Another less intuitive side-effect is that the temporary widening of pathways can be dangerous as well, because people typically make use of the additional space to overtake those who walk in front of them. This creates bottleneck situations when the pathway narrows again to its normal width. Finally, recent computer simulations have revealed that sharp turns increase the physical pressure around the inner edge of the bend [28] . Even though turnings are not necessarily dangerous, they constitute potential zones of danger in case of unexpected overcrowding.",

Clear signs of emergency, such as people falling or calling for help usually happen at a stage that is already critical and does not enable a timely response. The most accurate indicator of danger is the local density level. Recent studies have revealed the existence of local density thresholds above which the danger to the crowd is significantly increased [28] : Stop-and-go waves tend to emerge beyond 2-4 people/m 2 , while crowd turbulence is likely to occur above 4-7 people/m 2 , depending on the average body diameter. The problem is that local densities are hard to measure without a proper monitoring system, which is not available at many mass events. Nevertheless, crowd managers can make use of simple signs as a proxy for local density. For example, one may observe the frequency and strength of body contacts among neighboring people. Typically, when the frequency of involuntary body contacts increases-often perceived as pushy behavior-this indicates that pressure in the crowd builds up and pressure relief strategies are needed. Crowd managers should also be alerted by the emergence of stop-and-go-waves, a self-organized phenomenon characterized by alternating moving and stopping phases, which is visible to the naked eye [27, 28] . As this stop-and-go pattern is related with a reduced flow of people, the density may quickly increase due to the vicious circle effect described in the previous section, so that measures for pressure relief must be taken. Finally, behaviors such as people climbing walls, overcoming fences, or disrespecting conventional routesoften interpreted as relentless and aggressive behaviors-may indicate escape attempts. They should be considered as a serious warning signal of a possible, upcoming crowd disaster.",

A reliable flow of information between the visitors of an event, the organizers, security staff, police and ambulance is crucial for coordination. In fact, visitors often become aware of developing congestion too late because of the short-range visibility in crowded areas. This may impair orientation, which further increases the problems in the critical zone. In such situations, calm but clear loud speaker announcements informing visitors and well visible, variable message signs can let people know why they have to wait and what they should do. A robust communication system often constitutes the last means to gain control before a situation gets out of hand. It is also important that crowd managers have a reliable overview of the situation. Existing technologies offer useful monitoring systems that allow for realtime measurements of density levels and predictions of future crowd movements (also see Sect. 2.3 describing the use of smartphone applications for inferring crowd density). While such sophisticated monitoring systems are among the most efficient ways to keep track of the situation, most events are not yet using them. The minimum necessary requirement, however, is video monitoring covering the relevant zones of the event, from which the organizers can precisely evaluate the crowd movements and detect signs of upcoming congestion.",

In combination with a large market penetration they provide an excellent instrument for crowd monitoring. In particular, data can be acquired by deploying a mobile application that probes relevant modalities, e.g. the GPS or acceleration sensors.

The velocity of festival visitors is represented in Fig. 7 and the movement direction in Fig. 8 . Together the three figures reflect the collective crowd dynamics. While Fig. 6 shows spectator densities for multiple events at different times, Figs. 7 and 8 show the mobility of the crowd before, during, and after the fireworks show at lake Z\u00fcrich. Mobility patterns can be clearly identified. For instance, a strong northbound flow of the crowd can be observed before the event. Interestingly, lanes appear with a right-handed pedestrian traffic (highlighted box), which improves mobility. To support such kind of self-regulation, street signs (e.g., walking direction arrows) have been employed at other places, for instance at obstacles dividing the pathway.",

The homicide rate in the United States, for example, began to rise steadily in the 1960s and oscillated at around 8 to 10 homicides per 100,000 for 20 years. It only started to significantly decline in the early 1990s (see Fig. 9b ). In fact, such fluctuations in the frequency of crime are visible across a wide and diverse spectrum of criminal offenses, suggesting that cyclic recurrence is a fundamental characteristic of crime (see Fig. 9c ). This observation is notable, in particular, as different criminal offenses- 2 Since the beginning of the privatization of the US prison services in the 1970s the number of prisoners in the US has increased 8-fold from about 300,000 to 2.4 million (US Bureau of Justice Statistics, http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbse&sid=5, accessed April 16, 2014) . In international comparison this implies that with only a twentieth of the world population, the US accounts for a quarter of the world wide prison population [41] . 3 It is also interesting to note that a single prisoner annually costs more than the pay of a postdoctoral researcher. For a recent study on US prison costs per inmate see [43] . homicide and theft, for example-are thought to arise from different kinds of motivations: homicides are usually assumed to be related to manifestations of aggression, whereas theft is most often economically motivated [46] .",

In a structureless dataset, that is in a dataset where the timing of events is statistically independent, the CCDF of inter-event times simply follows an exponential distribution. The deviation of timing signatures from an exponential shape-for example log-normal or stretch exponential signatures-thus points to significant correlations between the timing of subsequent events. 6 Researchers have offered competing explanations for these system-level statistical regularities. The power laws in the severity of attacks, for example, have been linked to competition of insurgent groups and security forces for control of the state [7] , but also to a positive feedback loop between the size and experience of terrorist organizations or insurgent groups and the frequency with which they commit attacks [75] .",

            "text": "It is important to note that the choice of spatial and temporal units of analysis in such aggregate, system-level analysis may strongly affect results. Choosing empirically motivated and sufficiently small spatial units of analysis avoids problems arising from considering time series of potentially unrelated or only very weakly related incidents. In the context of Iraq, for example, the violence dynamics in the Kurdish dominated North are generally quite different from those in Baghdad or the Sunni triangle. The same applies to the selection of suitable time periods, in which the same conflict mechanisms produce aggregate patterns. In fact, the non-parametric analysis of event timing signatures rests on the assumption that the conflict dynamics in the period analyzed are (approximately) stationary [8] . Timing analyses are therefore usually performed for shorter time intervals-for example 6 months-where the overall intensity of conflict does not significantly change (see Fig. 13 ). where the event timing signature is non-trivial. Note that timing analysis was performed for the greater Baghdad area to avoid spurious timing signatures of unrelated events (see also the \"Discussion\" in the text). The data were obtained from the Guardian website [76] ; fit lines shown were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation [77] While such statistical signatures point to similarities in conflict patterns across cases and help identify general conflict mechanisms, detailed case studies on the micro-dynamics of violence suggest that mechanisms at the group-or individual-level may be very conflictand context-specific [78] . A number of micro-level mechanisms that all contribute to the aggregate violence patterns are likely to be present in many conflicts (see, for example Ref. [79] ). The effect of (local) contact between warring factions on levels of violence, for instance, has been of central interest in conflict studies. Examining violence in Jerusalem between 2001 and 2009, a recent study addresses this question using an innovative combi-nation of formal computational modeling and rich, spatially disaggregated data on violent incidents and contextual variables [80] . Past research has given empirical support for two competing perspectives: The first assumes that intermixed group settlement patterns reduce violence, as more frequent interactions enable rivals to overcome their prejudices towards each other and thus become more tolerant. The other argues that group segregation more effectively reduces violence, given less frequent contact and fewer possibilities for violent encounters (see Ref. [80] for a detailed overview of the literature supporting the two perspectives).",

            "text": "One key difficulty in research on the micro-dynamics of conflict is focusing on the \"correct\" theoretically and empirically plausible mechanisms that drive violence. In the study on Jerusalem, for example, one specific mechanism was shown to account for a significant part of the spatial patterns of violence in the city. This and similar studies are powerful in the sense that they explicitly test a particular causal micro-macro-link. Similarly, one may reverse this process and try to infer micro-processes based on the macro-patterns. Recently, such causal inference designs have been extended to be applicable to micro-level conflict event data. A novel inferential technique called Matched Wake Analysis (MWA) [81] estimates the causal effect of different types of conflict events on the subsequent conflict trajectory. Using sliding spatial and temporal windows around intervention events guarantees that the choice of unit of analysis does not systematically bias inferences, a problem known as the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) [82, 83] . For robust causal inference the method uses statistical matching [84] on previous conflict trends and geographic covariates. In order to the estimate average treatment effects for one type of event (treatment) relative to another one (control) the method uses a Difference-in-Differences regression design. Formally, it estimates how the number of dependent events after interventions, n post , changes compared to the number of dependent events prior, n pre , as a function of interventions 7 : n post = \u03b2 0 + \u03b2 1 \u00b7 n pre + \u03b2 2 \u00b7 treatment + u (13) In this expression \u03b2 2 is the estimated average treatment effect of the treated, our quantity of interest (see Ref. [81] for further details on the method). Such inferential methodology is especially useful when testing specific causal hypotheses, in particular those that may otherwise be difficult to detect against the background of largescale violence unrelated to the hypothesized mechanism. We have previously emphasized the importance of reactive dynamics for an understanding of endogenous conflict processes. One such example is the effects of counterinsurgency measures on the level of insurgent violence. The direction of these effects is generally disputed, both theoretically and empirically. One line of reasoning suggests that hurting civilians indiscriminately will generally cause reactive support for the military adversary [70, 85] . Another line of thinking suggests that the deterrent effect of such measures leads to less support for the adversary [68, 86] .",

Specifically, we focus on the greater Baghdad area-the focal area of violence-and consider three frequent types of events. Raids refer to surprise attacks on homes and compounds, in which the military suspects insurgents or arms caches. The relative heavy-handedness and the high probability of disturbing or harming innocent bystanders sets these operations apart from more selective detentions. In turn, to attack incumbent forces insurgents frequently rely on Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and civilian support in manufacturing, transporting, and planting them. If civilians were really more inclined to support the strategic adversary after having been targeted in raids, one would expect more IED attacks to take place after and in the spatial vicinity of raids compared to detentions or arrests under otherwise comparable conditions. The opposite should be true if deterrence (by raids) was the mechanism at work. As visible in Fig. 14 , raids lead to higher levels of subsequent IED attacks compared to detentions: our estimates suggest that 2-3 raids, lead to one additional IED attack in the direct spatial vicinity within up to 10-12 days. This result thus lends empirical support to the notion that civilians support the adversary in reaction to indiscriminate violence. Based on such improved methodology for studying micro-level processes in conflicts, it is possible to gain a better and systematic understanding of the driving forces behind violence.",

Data used for this analysis are significant action (SIGACT) military data (see for example Ref. [70] ) (Color figure online) the multitude of mechanisms underlying the ensemble properties. Yet in practice, the two research strands often exist rather disconnected and insights from one do not enter into the analysis or models of the other. While there may in principle be a systematic limit to the generalizability of insights from the macro to the micro level and vice versa, the current situation is clearly a consequence of lack of engagement with the respective \"other\" literature.",

Historical studies of single wars lack out-of-sample predictive power [87] [88] [89] . More systematic approaches focusing on the conditions that tend to lead to war (e.g., arms races [90] , long-standing territorial rivalries [91] , or large and rapid shifts in power [92, 93] ) rely on indicators that are coarse in time (typically yearly), and therefore tend to miss the crucial steps of the escalation of tensions and the timing of the conflict outbreak [11, [94] [95] [96] . Efforts at finer-grained codification of geopolitical tensions are labor-intensive and costly [97, 98] and limited in time [99, 100] . More systematic coding mechanisms using computer algorithms [101, 102] also have a limited time span, as do prediction markets [103, 104] . In addition, event-based data tend to miss the subtleties of international interactions: on the one hand, the absence of an event may be as important as its occurrence. Moreover, seem- ingly large events need not be cause for alarm whereas small events may greatly matter. The main obstacle to testing our ability to forecast conflicts, in other words, has been the lack of measures of tensions that are both fine-grained in time and cover a large time-span [105] [106] [107] .",

Each vertical line is a boxplot of the bootstrapped median number of conflict-related news prior to all interstate wars since 1902. The number of news tends to rise well ahead of the onset of conflict, and to remain relatively high thereafter, reflecting growing concerns prior to a conflict and lingering ones after its onset [12] .03 available at the time (out-of-sample forecasting). Using such data, the onset of a war within the next few months could be predicted with up to 85 % confidence. Keyword-based predictions significantly improved upon existing methods.

The outbreak of conflict is rarely unavoidable. While countries often prepare for potential conflicts well in advance, the escalation of tensions typically reflects a failed bargaining process, and news articles mirror this escalation by reporting on these developments. Yet, escalation is rarely linear, and its outcome remains uncertain until the very end. A negotiated solution can always be reached before hostilities start. As a result, proximity to the conflict will probably increase not only observers' (journalists) worries about the outcome of the process, but may also generate diverging opinions and scenarios about the likely outcome of the process. As a result, we should observe not only an increase over time in the number of conflict-related news, but also an increase in the variance associated with these news.",

            "text": "In the previous sections, we have seen how crime and conflict can spread in space and time. We will now address another serious threat, the emergence and worldwide spread of infectious diseases. Pandemics have plagued mankind since the onset of civilization. The transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer life styles to settled cultures marked a point in history at which growing human populations, in combination with increasingly cultured life-stock, led to zoonotic infectious diseases crossing the intra-species barrier. New pathogens that could be sustained in human populations evolved, and eventually lead to infectious diseases specific to humans. It is thus no surprise that the greatest killer among viral diseases, the smallpox virus, emerged approx. 4000-7000 years ago [111] . It is estimated that smallpox alone has caused between 300 and 500 million deaths, and along with measles killed up to 90 % of the native American population in the years that followed contact with Europeans in the fifteenth century. Historic records indicate that various large scale pandemics with devastating consequences swept through Europe in the past two millennia. The Antonine Plague (smallpox or measles) killed up to 5 million people in ancient Rome and has been argued to be one of the factors that lead to the destabilization of the Roman Empire [112] , while the Black Death (bubonic plague) swept across the European continent in the fourteenth century and erased more than 25 % of the European population [113] . The largest known pandemic in history, the Spanish flu of 1918-1919, caused an estimated 20-50 million deaths worldwide within a year, more than the casualties of World War I over the previous 4 years. This pandemic was caused by an influenza A virus subtype H1N1, a strain similar to the one that triggered the 2009 influenza pandemic (\"swine flu\"). Although all of these major events are unique and different from each other in many ways, a number of factors are common to all of them. First, increasing interactions with animal populations in farming increases the likelihood that novel pathogens are introduced to human populations. Second, larger and denser human populations increase the opportunity for pathogens to evolve the ability to be sustained in these populations, adapt to the new human host, and trigger local outbreaks. Third, increasing mobility, for instance driven by trade and commerce, promotes the spatial distribution of emergent pathogens, and generates the conditions for full-blown pandemics to follow a local outbreak.",

            "text": "In recent decades, the threat of pandemics has been substantially reduced by a more advanced medical system, the development of sophisticated antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and vaccination campaigns. The greatest success along these lines is the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1979 by a decade-long global vaccination campaign. Today, worldwide health surveillance systems for timely outbreak identification are in place, containing emergent infectious disease, and combating endemic diseases such as polio, tuberculosis, and malaria. However, although advances along these lines are promising news, modern civilization also contributes to the emergence of new pandemics. First, intensive animal farming or industrial livestock production yields a higher rate of intra-species barrier crossing and thus the emergence of potentially virulent human infectious diseases. Second, worldwide Pandemics of the past and present. Global disease proliferation has been prevalent throughout human history. Before worldwide eradication in 1979, smallpox had claimed the largest death toll since its emergence approx. 5,000 years ago followed by measles which is believed to have killed a substantial fraction of native Americans in the times after Columbus. Both, the Justinian Plague and the Black Death were caused by bacterial diseases and each one killed more than half the European population in a few years. The twentieth century Spanish flu claimed more victims that world war I and HIV/AIDS is the most recent globally prevalent non-curable infectious disease population increases quickly, having recently crossed the 7 billion mark. More than 50 % of the Earth's population live in dense metropolitan mega cities, thus providing ideal conditions for an emergent pathogen to be sustained by human-to-human contacts. Third, the modern world is extremely connected by intense long range traffic. For example, more than three billion passengers travel among four thousand globally distributed airports every year (Fig. 18) . Containing global pandemics is certainly a major concern to ensure stable socio-economic conditions in the world and anything that can potentially reduce the socio-economic impact of these events is helpful. In the last decade mathematically parsimonious SIR (susceptibleinfected-recovered) models [114] have been extended successfully by including social interaction networks, spatial effects, as well as public and private transport, and by more and more fine-grained epidemiological models [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] . One of the most relevant and surprising lessons of such models is that, in order to minimize the number of casualties and costs of fighting diseases in industrialized countries, it might be economically plausible for them to share vaccine doses with developing countries, even for free [121] . In this way, the number of infections can be more effectively contained, particularly in the critical, early stage of disease spreading.",

In 1766 Daniel Bernoulli published a paper on the effectiveness of inoculation against smallpox infections [122] . His seminal work not only contained the first application of the theory of differential equations, but was also published before it was known that infectious diseases were caused by bacteria or viruses and were transmissible. The prevalent scientific opinion in Bernoulli's time was that infectious diseases were caused by an invisible poisonous vapor, known as the miasma. Evidence existed, however, that inoculation of healthy individuals with degraded smallpox material incurred immunity to smallpox in some cases. Bernoulli's theoretical work shed light on the effectiveness of this procedure, a topic vividly discussed by the scientific elite of Europe at that time. In the beginning of the twentieth century Kermack and McKendrick laid the foundation of mathematical epidemiology in a series of publications [123, 124] and introduced the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model which is still used today in most state-of-the-art computational models for the dynamics of infectious diseases (see also Refs. [125, 126] ).",

The combination of local, initially exponential growth typical of disease dynamics, with diffusion in space, generically yields regular wave fronts and constant spreading speeds. This type of approach was successfully applied in the context the spread of the Black Death in Europe in the fourteenth century [128] .

This is illustrated in Fig. 19 which shows the worldwide air transportation network. This network connects approx. four thousand airports worldwide and transports more than three billion passengers every year. Recent examples have shown that the strong spatial heterogeneity of the human population in combination with the lack of scale in global mobility no longer lead to regular wave patterns of global disease spread. SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2003 initially proliferated in China but only shortly after its arrival in Hong Kong cases were reported in Canada, the United States and Europe. In 2009, the H1N1 pandemic started in Mexico, quickly reached the US and subsequently arrived in Europe and elsewhere in the world. The spread of modern epidemics is spatially incoherent and chaotic, generically does note bear any metric regularity, and observed spatio-temporal patterns depend sensitively on the outbreak location. All these factors complicate the development of predictive tools that can forecast the time course of emergent infectious diseases.",

Because of the client/server architecture, a model can be defined on the client, and the simulation itself can be run on a remote super-computer in little time. A clear advantage of the GLEAM software is that entire sets of fully stochastic simulations can be performed in order to compute confidence intervals along with the most probable time course. In this respect the design of the GLEAM infrastructure is similar to modern weather forecast systems. The GLEAM project and related simulation approaches have become remarkably successful in reproducing observed patterns and predicting the temporal evolution of ongoing epidemics [130] for instance in predicting the time-course of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.",

Generically these parameters interact non-linearly in a given model, and despite their predictive power, it is difficult to assess which parameters are important and which are less significant. We currently lack a full understanding of the dynamic richness of these highly detailed models and therefore also of the phenomena they describe. Another drawback of purely detailed computational approaches is the fact that parameter values must be chosen and fixed to run a specific computer simulation. This is particularly challenging when new infectious agents emerge for which none of the vital disease specific parameters are known. Consequently, at the onset of an emergent epidemic even the most sophisticated simulation frameworks have to be employed with great caution because, despite their potential to model the phenomenon in a very detailed way, a significant level of uncertainty remains concerning the choices of sensitive parameters.",

Gaining a better understanding of the phenomenon, however, is particularly important because based on a deeper understanding we can potentially predict certain aspects about the most likely time course of a global epidemic, even when a set of parameters is unknown. Along this line of reasoning, in [14] the authors introduce the notion of effective distance to replace conventional geographic distance. This move simplifies the complexity of the spatio-temporal dynamics of global diseases to the point that even complex network-driven contagion phenomena can be understood in the framework of ordinary reaction-diffusion dynamics. In other words, when effective distance replaces geographic distance, spreading phenomena that appear to be complex in conventional geographic representations possess simple wave fronts and constant speeds. Thus, the key result of the study was that the observed complexity is predominantly caused by the inappropriate and antiquated use of purely spatial distance measures.",

If we now consider each node in the metapopulation network as the catchment area of each airport in the global mobility network and take F nm as the passenger flux between airports n and m, the above dynamical system constitutes a structurally simple model for the global spread of an emergent infectious disease. In fact, the earliest successful models that incorporated worldwide mobility were structurally similar to Eq. (19) and most sophisticated models (e.g the GLEAM simulation framework) possess an underlying mathematical machinery of similar nature [116, 121, 133, 134] . Essentially the above This implies that mobility has the slowest time-scale of the system. The complexity of the above model is encapsulated in the flux fraction matrix elements P mn which is shaped by the spatial heterogeneity of the metapopulation and the multiscale properties of the global mobility network. It is this coupling matrix that causes solutions of the above model to appear spatiotemporally complex, as is shown in Fig. 21 . The figure depicts temporal snapshots of two simulated pandemics (i.e. solutions to Eq. (19) ) with initial outbreaks in London and Chicago. Because of the inherent complexity in the global mobility network, i.e. the coupling matrix P nm , the patterns appear to be complex, spatially incoherent and quickly lose any correlation to their initial outbreak location. Clearly, no geographic wave front is discernible except in the very beginning of the spreading process. The lack of geographic imprint makes it difficult to predict arrival time sequences from the maps alone. Furthermore, the geographic de-correlation makes it impossible to reconstruct the initial outbreak location based on a single temporal snapshot of the process. Unlike historic spreading processes that evolved according to more regular wave propagation, modern global disease dynamics make it difficult to define a proper propagation speed by, for instance, correlating geographic distance with arrival times. Because the spatio-temporal complexity generated by the model is caused by the coupling matrix P nm , a plausible strategy for defining an effective distance measure must relate this distance to the coupling matrix. A possible choice is the following definition of an effective, directed length of a link m \u2192 n in the network:",

The effective distance approach shows that complexity science, and network science in particular, can help extract properties of a potential spread that are largely robust against variations in these parameters. Thus universal statements about a potential global spread can be made. This is very valuable information during the onset of an epidemic since one can initiate effective containment strategies with minimal information concerning the disease. Because the approach is so general and is entirely based on the use of a more appropriate notion of distance in heterogeneous network systems, it is clearly applicable to other types of contagion processes that occur on networks, such as the spread of news, information or fads in social networks. Another insight gained by the approach is that one observes concentric wave patterns only from the perspective of the outbreak origin. From the perspective of any other node in the network, the dynamic pattern appears more irregular. This can be quantified and used to reconstruct the outbreak origin for contagion phenomena that have been spreading but are unnoticed until the incidence passes a certain threshold [135] . Typically these incidence patterns bear no geographic regularity and it is difficult, albeit essential, to reconstruct the spatial origin in order to develop efficient containment strategies. The effective distance approach can help reconstruct the outbreak origin by identifying the node from which the observed pattern appears to be most regular. This approach has successfully reconstructed outbreak origins of recent epidemics, e.g. the foodborne disease EHEC/HUS that struck Germany and its European neighbors in 2011.",

Here we will investigate when voluntary vaccination [140, 141] can be a viable alternative to imposing immunization in a top-down way. That is, we use a model to determine if and when information about the risk of becoming ill will enable individuals to voluntarily make decisions that are beneficial, not only to their own health, but also to the health of many others.",

More specifically, following prior models [140] and experimental evidence [143] , we assume that individuals make rational choices. In this framework an individual who vaccinates will incur a cost c v (the cost of vaccination) and one that becomes ill will incur the cost of infection c i (we assume that vaccines have 100 % efficacy and thus vaccinated indi-viduals will never become infected, but this assumption can be easily relaxed). Therefore, the expected cost to an individual who vaccinates is c v . Meanwhile, the expected cost to an individual who does not vaccinate is c i R, where R is an individual's estimate of the probability that she will fall ill if she does not vaccinate. We further assume that R is simply estimated to be the fraction of infected others she sees; thus R = j in a well-mixed model.",

However, as discussed in Sect. 4.1, the complex contact patterns between individuals, which mediate the spread of diseases in the real world, lead to spatio-temporal variation in infection levels. Therefore, we ask how the effectiveness of voluntary vaccination changes when individuals make immunization choices using information that incorporates this variability. To answer this question we introduce a model where individuals interact physically only with a subset of the population, which we call contact neighbors. We employ the formalism of a network [144] to represent this contact structure [145] [146] [147] . Each individual is represented by a node, and the links between nodes represent the potential for an infectious interaction. To model variation in the information that individuals have about the health of others, we introduce a second network where individuals are connected if they are informed about each other's state. (The transmission of information could be through any mechanism: e.g. through direct conversation, word of mouth, observation of symptoms, mass-media reporting, or social media.) The information neighborhood can be (1) a subset of the contact network, (2) exactly equal to it, or (3) a superset (see Fig. 25 ). By construction, all individuals have the same number of contact neighbors k and the same number of information neighbors k info . However, we allow for the number of contact neighbors to differ from the number of information neighbors. The key point is that, in this setting, an individual estimates the risk of infection R from the fraction of its infected information neighbors (rather than considering Fig. 25 The right information range facilitates disease eradication. Probability F that the disease is eradicated after a fixed time T , as a function of k info /N , the fraction of the total population within an individual's information neighborhood (here N = 10 4 agents). The main figure is for a lattice network while the inset shows a random network, both with a contact neighborhood of size k = 12. An individual interacts with others in her contact neighborhood (red) and sees the state of those in her information neighborhood (blue). The overlapping area is shown in violet. The information neighborhood is a subset of the contact neighborhood when k > k info , exactly the same when k = k info , and a superset when k < k info (Color figure online) the global fraction of infected individuals as above). For both of these networks we consider two types of topologies: (1) a network where every node has the same predetermined number of neighbors but otherwise has a random structure, and (2) a lattice network (for description of these two types of networks see a standard network reference, e.g. Ref. [144] ). These two simple network topologies are different enough to demonstrate that the results we find are not due to specific structural features.",

To estimate the probability that vaccination will remove the disease from the population, we fix a time T much larger than the transient time, and count the number of simulations where j (T ) = 0. We find that this fraction F of simulations where the disease is eradicated changes systematically with k info (see Fig. 24 ). Interestingly, F exhibits a clear maximum when the information neighborhood is of an intermediate size. Access to information about a growing number of neighbors initially facilitates eradication of the disease. However, as individuals average over information obtained from increasingly large regions of the system, the disease becomes decreasingly likely to die out. Further experiments indicate that this qualitative behavior holds across different epidemiological parameters that allow the infection to invade the population when there is no vaccination, 10 although the mechanisms driving the behavior vary [148] .",

For example, harmful cascade effects resulting from systemic instabilities and related loss of control may be countered by suitable system designs with engineered breaking points or adaptive decoupling strategies such as separation or immunization [15] : 11 Bankruptcy cascades [149] are a good example for this. 12 A recent report on CIA practices calls the effectiveness of \"harsh interrogation\" techniques into question (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/31/senate-torture-report_n_5061921.html, accessed Apr. 16, 2014) , and an independent US panel recently concluded that mass surveillance of phone data has been ineffective in detecting terrorist threats (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-25856570, accessed Jan. 24, 2014) .

            "text": "1. For example, when the density is so high that there are involuntary body contacts between many people, crowd disasters are quite likely. Under such conditions, forces are transferred between the bodies of people. They may push them around in a phenomenon called \"crowd turbulence\", such that some individuals may stumble. If someone is falling to the ground, a domino effect is likely to cause many people to fall over each other. As a consequence, the people on the ground may suffocate. To avoid this, evacuation (pressure relief strategies) are required early on, to avoid densities under which forces may be transmitted between bodies. In other words, low enough densities will avoid cascade effects. One possible way of reaching this is the use of apps that provide re-routing recommendations to visitors of mass events. 2. We have also seen that crime may spread by imitation of successful neighbors. In our model, we have studied the effect of peer punishment (which also underlies the establishment of social norms). Surprisingly, crime cannot be eliminated by more deterrence and high discovery rates. The reason is that (most) people are not criminal by nature. Their behavior rather depends on the behaviors of their neighbors in the social interaction network. Hence, improving socio-economic conditions may be more effective than sending many people to prison. 3. Furthermore, deterrence may not only fail to stop terrorism but, on the contrary, may lead to more attacks. We showed that unspecific interventions causing harm to civilians tend to undermine the legitimacy of the \"war on terror\", which may instead increase civilian support for the cause of \"freedom fighters\". This, in turn, can ultimately lead to escalation instead of the intended de-escalation of violence. 4. In the context of the conflict in Jerusalem we discussed the effect of socio-cultural distance between different population groups on levels of violence. Deterrence or policing alone does not appear to be sufficient to deter violence between the various factions in the city. If the socio-cultural distance between the groups is too large, encounters in daily life may spark violent confrontations. Given large socio-cultural distances that can not easily be changed, an alternative and more effective strategy may be to limit the contact between groups and, thus, reduce the number of possible triggers and interrupt cascade effects. 5. A complementary approach to reducing violence is to predict the onset of conflict before it actually occurs. We discussed a methodology based on the analysis of large news archives to detect growing tensions that are indicative of potential escalations. In line with findings in complex biological and natural systems, early warnings signals for critical transitions can be found not only by direct measurement of the phenomenon-an increase in the number of conflict-related news prior to conflict-but also by other attributes of the time series, such as changes in variance over time. Based on such signals, international political, social, or economic efforts may be made to reduce upcoming tensions and thereby thwart confrontations and war. 6. Cascade effects do not only promote crowd disasters, crime and violence. They are also the basis of the epidemic spreading of diseases. We have presented an effective distance measure that can serve to understand the spatio-temporal infection dynamics, to identify the origin location of a disease, and to predict its further spreading. Thereby, the model can help to use limited immunization doses in a better way to contain pandemics more effectively. In order to reach the best possible immunization, well-adapted decentralized information strategies, e.g. through social media, promise to be most effective.",

            "text": "The above insights can contribute to saving human lives by promoting approaches that differ markedly from commonly applied strategies. In particular, the findings discussed in our paper suggest that too strict control attempts may actually cause a loss of control in a complex system. The reason is that strong control may not only be expensive, but also ineffective, as it tends to undermine the natural capability of complex systems to self-organize. 13 To control a complex system, a \"long leash\", i.e. allowing for some flexibility (\"freedom\") often works better than a \"short leash\". 14 A promising approach along these lines is the principle of \"guided self-organization\" [15, 153] , i.e. to interfere with the system in a minimally invasive way, such that the system self-organizes and does by itself what we want it to do. In this context, it is worth reminding the reader of the \"minimally invasive\" principle of \"chaos control\", which just pushes the system slightly, at the right moment, to let it take a particular path [154] . Planning and control approaches mostly work well for stationary systems, while complex systems with extremely variable and hardly predictable dynamics call for enough autonomy to flexibly adapt to the respective local requirements [155] . In other words: managing complexity requires decentralized adaptation rather than centralized control. Nevertheless, it is possible (and even necessary) to enable the self-organization of complex systems [156] . Suitable institutional settings, such as proper organizational frameworks for mass events, can support systems in their self-organization and self-regulation, thereby reducing the need for interference. This means replacing (or complementing) the classical concept of planning and top down control with the concept of empowerment, i.e. creating opportunities for individuals to make desirable decisions rather than to enforce a particular way of reaching a goal [157, 158] . In fact, to be manageable, complex systems must be designed in such a way that the interactions and institutional framework jointly enable favorable self-organization.",

Before worldwide eradication in 1979, smallpox had claimed the largest death toll since its emergence approx. 5,000 years ago followed by measles which is believed to have killed a substantial fraction of native Americans in the times after Columbus. Both, the Justinian Plague and the Black Death were caused by bacterial diseases and each one killed more than half the European population in a few years.
