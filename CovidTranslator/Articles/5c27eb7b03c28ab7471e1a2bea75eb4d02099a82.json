Filter efficiency is tested by assessing the proportion of a 300 nanometer (0.3 microns) aerosol challenge, which is filtered by the device. To understand the nomenclature mentioned in the following Now, the size of coronavirus is around 100 nanometers (0.1 microns) 4 and hence simple mathematics would suggest that these particles would pass through most of these filters, which are tested for a 300nm particle challenge. However, particles smaller than 300nm do not travel in a linear motion but travel in a zig-zag movement as they are bounced randomly by molecules of comprising air (Brownian motion) 2 .",
