However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the \"Complementary Exposure\" pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.",

In the past two decades, two highly pathogenic human CoVs (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerging from animal reservoirs, have led to global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality 2 . For example, 8098 individuals were infected and 774 died in the SARS-CoV pandemic, which cost the global economy with an estimated $30 to $100 billion 3, 4 . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 2019, MERS-CoV has had a total of 2494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths, the majority in Saudi Arabia 2 . In December 2019, the third pathogenic HCoV, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2), as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (abbreviated as COVID- 19) 5 , was found in Wuhan, China. As of 24 February 2020, there have been over 79,000 cases with over 2600 deaths for the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak worldwide; furthermore, human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts 6 . However, there are currently no effective medications against 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Several national and international research groups are working on the development of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, but effective vaccines are not available yet. There is an urgent need for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.",

Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery and randomized clinical trials [9] [10] [11] . However, experimental approaches for drug repurposing is costly and time-consuming 12 . Computational approaches offer novel testable hypotheses for systematic drug repositioning [9] [10] [11] 13, 14 . However, traditional structure-based methods are limited when threedimensional (3D) structures of proteins are unavailable, which, unfortunately, is the case for the majority of human and viral targets. In addition, targeting single virus proteins often has high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes 1 .",

Systematic identification of virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) offers an effective way toward elucidating the mechanisms of viral infection 15, 16 . Subsequently, targeting cellular antiviral targets, such as virus-host interactome, may offer a novel strategy for the development of effective treatments for viral infections 1 , including SARS-CoV 17 , MERS-CoV 17 , Ebola virus 18 , and Zika virus 14, [19] [20] [21] . We recently presented an integrated antiviral drug discovery pipeline that incorporated gene-trap insertional mutagenesis, known functional drug-gene network, and bioinformatics analyses 14 . This methodology allows to identify several candidate repurposable drugs for Ebola virus 11, 14 . Our work over the last decade has demonstrated how network strategies can, for example, be used to identify effective repurposable drugs 13, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and drug combinations 28 for multiple human diseases. For example, network-based drug-disease proximity sheds light on the relationship between drugs (e.g., drug targets) and disease modules (molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules within the PPIs), and can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new indications for approved drugs, as well as drug combinations, as demonstrated in our recent studies 13, 23, 27, 28 .",

The nsp12 is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, together with co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 possessing high polymerase activity. From the protein 3D structure view of SARS-CoV nsp12, it contains a larger N-terminal extension (which binds to nsp7 and nsp8) and polymerase domain (Fig. 2c) . The spike is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in mediating viral infection through binding the host receptor 31, 32 . Figure 2d shows the 3D structure of the spike protein bound with the host receptor angiotensin converting enznyme2 (ACE2) in SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 6ACK). A recent study showed that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 is able to utilize ACE2 as an entry receptor in ACE2-expressing cells 33 , suggesting potential drug targets for therapeutic development. Furthermore, cryo-EM structure of the spike and biophysical assays reveal that the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV 34 .

In total, we obtained 119 host proteins associated with CoVs with various experimental evidence. Specifically, these host proteins are either the direct targets of HCoV proteins or are involved in crucial pathways of HCoV infection. The HCoV-host interactome network is shown in Fig. 3a . We identified several hub proteins including JUN, XPO1, NPM1, and HNRNPA1, with the highest number of connections within the 119 proteins. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed multiple significant biological pathways (adjusted P value < 0.05), including measles, RNA transport, NF-kappa B signaling, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and influenza (Fig. 3b ). Gene ontology (GO) biological process enrichment analysis further confirmed multiple viral infection-related processes (adjusted P value < 0.001), including viral life cycle, modulation by virus of host morphology or physiology, viral process, positive regulation of viral life cycle, transport of virus, and virion attachment to host cell (Fig. 3c ). We then mapped the known drug-target network (see Materials and methods) into the HCoV-host interactome to search for druggable, cellular targets. We found that 47 human proteins (39%, blue nodes in Fig. 3a) can be targeted by at least one approved drug or experimental drug under clinical trials. For example, GSK3B, DPP4, SMAD3, PARP1, and IKBKB are the most targetable proteins. The high druggability of HCoV-host interactome motivates us to develop a drug repurposing strategy by specifically targeting cellular proteins associated with HCoVs for potential treatment of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.",

Toremifene (Z = -3.23, Fig. 5a ), the first generation of nonsteroidal SERM, exhibits potential effects in blocking various viral infections, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and Ebola virus in established cell lines 17, 38 . Compared to the classical ESR1-related antiviral pathway, toremifene prevents fusion between the viral and endosomal membrane by interacting with and destabilizing the virus membrane glycoprotein, and eventually inhibiting viral replication 39 . As shown in Fig. 5b , toremifene potentially affects several key host proteins associated with HCoV, such as RPL19, HNRNPA1, NPM1, EIF3I, EIF3F, and EIF3E 40, 41 . Equilin (Z = -2.52 and GSEA score = 3), an estrogenic steroid produced by horses, also has been proven to have moderate activity in inhibiting the entry of Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein and human immunodeficiency virus (ZEBOV-GP/HIV) 18 .

Most of these drugs indirectly target HCoV-associated proteins via the human protein-protein interaction networks. All the drug-target-HCoV-associated protein connections were examined, and those proteins with at least five connections are shown. The box heights for the proteins indicate the number of connections.

Viral infections are often associated with immune-inflammatory injury, in which the level of oxidative stress increases significantly and leaves negative effects on the function of multiple organs 60 . The antioxidant effect of melatonin makes it a putative candidate drug to relieve patients' clinical symptoms in antiviral treatment, even though melatonin cannot eradicate or even curb the viral replication or transcription 61, 62 . In addition, the application of melatonin may prolong patients' survival time, which may provide a chance for patients' immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus. As shown in Fig. 5e , melatonin indirectly targets several HCoV cellular targets, including ACE2, BCL2L1, JUN, and IKBKB. Eplerenone (Z = -1.59), an aldosterone receptor antagonist, is reported to have a similar anti-inflammatory effect as melatonin.

Melatonin was reported in potential antiviral infection via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Melatonin indirectly regulates ACE2 expression, a key entry receptor involved in viral infection of HCoVs, including 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 (ref. 33 ).

Although 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shared high nucleotide sequence identity with other HCoVs (Fig. 2) , our predictions are not 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 specific by lack of the known host proteins on 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. We used a low binding affinity value of 10 \u03bcM as a threshold to define a physical drug-target interaction. However, a stronger binding affinity threshold (e.g., 1 \u03bcM) may be a more suitable cut-off in drug discovery, although it will generate a smaller drug-target network. Although sizeable efforts were made for assembling large scale, experimentally reported drug-target networks from publicly available databases, the network data may be incomplete and some drug-target interactions may be functional associations, instead of physical bindings. For example, Silvestrol, a natural product from the flavagline, was found to have antiviral activity against Ebola 75 and Coronaviruses 76 . After adding its target, an RNA helicase enzyme EIF4A 76 , silvestrol was predicted to be significantly associated with HCoVs (Z = -1.24, P = 0.041) by network proximity analysis. To increase coverage of drug-target networks, we may use computational approaches to systematically predict the drug-target interactions further 25, 26 . In addition, the collected virus-host interactions are far from completeness and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors, including different experimental assays and human cell line models. We may computationally predict a new virus-host interactome for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 using sequence-based and structure-based approaches 77 . Drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles 78 , as drugs can inhibit or activate protein functions (including antagonists vs. agonists). The current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic (antiviral) effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virus-host interactions. Comprehensive identification of the virus-host interactome for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2, with specific biological effects using functional genomics assays 79, 80 , will significantly improve the accuracy of the proposed network-based methodologies further.",

Integration of lung-specific gene expression 23 of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 host proteins and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling 83 may reduce side effects of repurposable drugs or drug combinations. Preclinical studies are warranted to evaluate in vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials. Furthermore, we only limited to predict pairwise drug combinations based on our previous network-based framework 28 . However, we expect that our methodology remain to be a useful network-based tool for prediction of combining multiple drugs toward exploring network relationships of multiple drugs' targets with the HCoV-host subnetwork in the human interactome. Finally, we aimed to systematically identify repurposable drugs by specifically targeting nCoV host proteins only. Thus, our current network models cannot predict repurposable drugs from the existing anti-virus drugs that target virus proteins only. Thus, combination of the existing anti-virus drugs (such as remdesivir 64 ) with the network-predicted repurposable drugs (Fig. 5 ) or drug combinations (Fig. 6 ) may improve coverage of current network-based methodologies by utilizing multi-layer network framework 16 .",

All inferred data, including evolutionary analysis, gene expression data, and metabolic associations, were excluded. The genes were mapped to their Entrez ID based on the NCBI database 92 as well as their official gene symbols based on GeneCards (https:// www.genecards.org/).

Differential gene expression in cells treated with various drugs were retrieved from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database 36 , and were used as gene profiles for the drugs.
