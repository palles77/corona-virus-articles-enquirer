            "text": "The start of the cholera epidemic in Haiti quickly highlighted the necessity of the implementation of an Alert and Response (A&R) System to complement the existing national surveillance system. The national system had been able to detect and confirm the outbreak etiology but required external support to monitor the spread of cholera and coordinate response, because much of the information produced was insufficiently timely for real-time monitoring and directing of a rapid, targeted response. The A&R System was designed by the Pan American Health Organization/ World Health Organization in collaboration with the Haiti Ministry of Health, and it was based on a network of partners, including any institution, structure, or individual that could identify, verify, and respond to alerts. The defined objectives were to (1) save lives through early detection and treatment of cases and (2) control the spread through early intervention at the community level. The operational structure could be broken down into three principle categories: (1) alert (early warning), (2) verification and assessment of the information, and (3) efficient and timely response in coordination with partners to avoid duplication. Information generated by the A&R System was analyzed and interpreted, and the qualitative information was critical in qualifying the epidemic and defining vulnerable areas, particularly because the national surveillance system reported incomplete data for more than one department. The A&R System detected a number of alerts unrelated to cholera and facilitated rapid access to that information. The sensitivity of the system and its ability to react quickly was shown in May of 2011, when an abnormal increase in alerts coming from several communes in the Sud-Est Department in epidemiological weeks (EWs) 17 and 18 were noted and disseminated network-wide and response activities were implemented. The national cholera surveillance system did not register the increase until EWs 21 and 22, and the information did not become available until EWs 23 and 24, when the peak of cases had already been reached. Although many of the partners reporting alerts during the peak of the cholera epidemic have since left Haiti, the A&R System has continued to function as an Early Warning (EWARN) System, and it continues to be developed with recent activities, such as the distribution of cell phones to enhance alert communication.",

In January of 2010, Haiti was struck by an earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale. It left an estimated 230,000 people dead, 300,000 people injured, and 1.3 million people homeless. The impact of the earthquake on the structures of the health sector was dramatic. The three most affected departments in the country, Nippes, Ouest, and Sud-Est, experienced severe damage or complete destruction of 60% of their hospitals. Management capabilities of the MSPP were also greatly affected, because 40% of MSPP buildings and training facilities were destroyed; also, 67% of MSPP staff were left homeless. Around 600,000 people were internally displaced to other departments because of the earthquake, causing a new category of vulnerable persons to emerge in the form of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The increase in IDPs put pressure on host populations and local healthcare systems. 2 In early 2010, national epidemiological information in Haiti came primarily from two sentinel systems, one system *Address correspondence to Patricia Santa-Olalla, Organizaci\u00f3 n Panamericana de Salud, Av.

E-mail: santaolallap@ par.ops-oms.org managed by the Cuban Medical Brigades (BMC), with personnel in 83 of 133 municipalities, and the other system from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which included 51 sentinel sites in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS relief (PEPFAR)-funded surveillance network for reporting on human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). These sites became the post-disaster National Sentinel Site Surveillance (NSSS) System. 3 In addition, a complementary system was developed to support disease surveillance among IDPs. This system, known as the IDP Surveillance System (IDPSS), was created by the MSPP, PAHO/WHO, and CDC to monitor communicable diseases in temporary clinics serving IDPs after the earthquake. 4 The MSPP with CDC support also expanded diagnostic capacity at the national laboratory of Haiti (Laboratoire National de Sant\u00e9 Publique) to identify reportable pathogens, including Vibrio cholerae. 5 Data were also being collected by many private and independent response partners, such as international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), for their own reporting and documentation needs.",

On October 19, 2010, the emergence of cholera, an epidemic disease new to Haiti, 6 made the already difficult humanitarian situation even more complex. The absence of health facilities in many areas and any practical knowledge about cholera as well as the poor preand post-earthquake water, sanitation, and living conditions throughout Haiti posed a major public health threat as cholera began to spread. The lack of experience and capacity of local actors in assessment resulted in an underestimation of the speed at which cholera would become a major outbreak across the entire country and rapidly overwhelm the already limited national capacity to respond. 7 Outbreaks in remote rural areas were of special concern, because of both scant resources and limited infrastructure to treat cases and implement cholera prevention activities.",

As of October 31, 2010, the epidemic was already affecting five of ten departments-Artibonite, Center, Nord, Nord-Ouest, and Ouest-in Haiti. 9 The national health system had been able to detect and confirm the outbreak etiology but required external support to monitor the spread of the disease and direct and coordinate response. National cholera surveillance system. On November 1, 2010, a disease-specific indicator-based surveillance system supported by the CDC was initiated, because the existing reportable disease surveillance systems were unable to provide the necessary accurate and timely information on cholera. 5 This disease-specific surveillance was set up in parallel to the existing NSSS and started operating on November 1, 2010. A case definition for cholera was commonly agreed on among the MSPP, PAHO, CDC, and other partners and distributed to healthcare institutions together with a specific case reporting form. 10 Up to December of 2010, the case definition included any person with three or more liquid stools with or without vomiting in the last 24 hours. From mid-December of 2010, the case definition was any case of profuse acute watery diarrhea with or without vomiting in a department affected by cholera (from November 21, 2010, all departments were affected).",

Early warning (EWARN) systems are timely surveillance systems that collect information on potential risks to public health to trigger prompt public health action and should be implemented early in an emergency. 11, 12 An EWARN detects alerts or clusters and sudden changes in trends of events that could be a potential hazard to health through an epidemic intelligence 13,14 process, which integrates both indicator-and event-based components. The indicator-based component refers to the information coming from routine surveillance systems based on the regular reporting of a number of previously well-defined items or indicators provided mainly by healthcare facilities. The eventbased component refers to unstructured and diverse information coming from multiple types of sources, both official and informal (including unverified rumors from the media), that usually needs to be verified, assessed, and investigated. The aim of event-based surveillance is event detection before official reporting, confirmation, and eventual notification. [15] [16] [17] The early warning functions of surveillance are fundamental for national, regional, and global health security. The importance of early detection and response to health risks is reflected in the IHR (2005). 1 The regulations were unanimously approved by the World Health Assembly in May of 2005 and entered into force in June of 2007. They constitute a significant advance in global surveillance and public health security 18-20 and a major paradigm shift compared with the previous regulations. The IHR (2005) expand the range of events that States must notify to the WHO and to which the regulations apply, and they introduce a new class of event, the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Other substantive changes consist of the inclusion of a decision instrument to facilitate the identification of the new events to be reported, the requirement for Member States to establish National IHR Focal Points for communication with WHO and develop core capacities for surveillance and response, and the new responsibilities of the WHO. 1 ",

The PAHO-MSPP A&R System was based on a network of partners supported by the health cluster mechanism that included any institution, structure, or individual that could identify, verify, and respond to alerts. The system was composed of a national alert team (an Alert and Response coordinator, an epidemiologist or public health expert with experience in event-based disease surveillance and disease control) based in Port-au-Prince and the PAHO/ WHO field teams based at the departmental level covering all departments in Haiti. During the first phase of the response, both the A&R coordinator/epidemiologist and the field teams were mainly staffed by GOARN personnel and supported by the PAHO/WHO structure. Essential to this system was a broad network of partners, including MSPP staff at national and departmental levels, partners from different response clusters (http://haiti .humanitarianresponse.info/), NGOs, the CDC, the BMC, the UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) and other UN agencies, public and private hospitals, local authorities or leaders, and other governmental and non-governmental institutions (Figure 1 ).",

Despite the support, the involvement of national officials in running the A&R System remained a challenge because of a lack of resources and the limited technical capacity available. To date, the system is still operating, with the MSPP staff supported by the epidemiologists of the PAHO/WHO Country Office. To ensure that reports on alerts reach both the MSPP epidemiologists on the field and departmental coordinators as well as the managers of the MSPP's CTCs and CTUs, the MSPP distributed cell phones to them and developed a system with PAHO for transmitting data through text messages.

In this context, an event-based surveillance system becomes of paramount importance to improve core surveillance capacities to detect, assess, notify, and respond to health threats as well as prevent and control the spread of diseases inside and beyond borders, as reflected in the IHR (2005). 1, 11, 27 The A&R System set up by the PAHO/WHO with GOARN support showed how the rapid detection of cholera alerts was a key element to the identification of outbreaks and to direct and coordinate urgent response. In contrast, the national cholera surveillance only had access to data from healthcare facilities in a context where one-half of the national population does not have access to a health center. 28, 29 The A&R System was able to identify, verify, and respond to outbreaks in hard-to-reach communities. The investigation that followed each alert identified major gaps in prevention and response, such as the lack of WASH partners in several departments, and highlighted the need to improve the implementation of prevention and control strategies at the community level.",

The latter period coincides with a time during which many partners were closing their cholera treatment facilities and scaling down their cholera activities. It also coincides with the start of the rainy season in 2011. These peaks in the numbers of alerts matched an observed increase in the number of new cholera cases in the country based on the cholera epidemiological data from the MSPP. From EW 25 of 2011, the number of alerts received decreased. This trend could have been related to a real decrease in the number of new cholera cases or the departure of many partners",
