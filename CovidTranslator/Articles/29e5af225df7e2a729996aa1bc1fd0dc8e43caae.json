However, Chinese medicine doctors (CMDs) follow the traditional treatment rules to select or administer these diverse Chinese medicine formulae. The main purpose of our study was to explore data on the frequency of medication and medication habits by CMDs for the treatment of URTIs with Chinese herbs and Chinese medicine formulae. Methods: The TCM treatments for patients consulting with an URTIs were analyzed from the National Health Insurance Research Database using the appropriate codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnoses for Taiwan in 2009. A data mining and association rules, were used to analyze co-prescriptions of TCM for patients with URTIs. Results: For 472,005 patients who sought the treatment of URTIs, a total of 46,805 patients with URTIs received TCM treatments, of these 29,052 patients sought both TCM and Western medication treatments. Of the URTIs patients who had received a TCM treatment, 79% presented with an acute common cold, 9% had influenza, and 9% had acute upper respiratory infections. Furthermore, 53.89% of the sample were aged between 20 and 49 years, and 62.84% were women, 3.56% of the patients used Yin-Qiao-San and 2.76% used Jie-Geng. Yin-Qiao-San and Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang were the most commonly combinations of prescriptions for patients with URTIs. Conclusions: The patients experiencing URTIs were more likely to request TCM treatment if their symptoms were mild and they were women. The Chinese medicine doctors treating URTIs generally followed TCM theory. A coding system for TCM diagnostic classifications could improve evaluations of TCM treatments.",

To the best of our knowledge, the current principles of the TCM treatments used for diseases, such as URTIs remain diverse. Therefore, this study employed a database analysis to investigate the basis of Chinese medicine doctors' (CMD) treatments. Several reports have described how TCM treatments for URTIs and related diseases, including influenza, can alleviate symptoms with fewer side effects [3, 4] . The efficacy of TCM possibly results from the antibacterial and antiviral effects of the Chinese herbs and formulae [5] . Many articles mention Chinese herbal medicines may shorten the symptomatic phase in patients with the common cold and treat or prevent seasonal influenza. However, these articles are weak owing to the lack of high quality TCM trials. Well-designed clinical trials are required [6] [7] [8] . In spite of this, many extracts of medical herbs have been found to have the potential to treat URTIs and prevent colds [9, 10] . Some Chinese herbs have even been recommended as a treatment to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [11] . The same Chinese herbs or formulae may be used to treat many diseases, and CMDs may use a single Chinese herb or a mixture of herbs, depending on their experience. Nevertheless, how CMDs follow the treatment rules to select or administer these drugs or Chinese medicine formulae remains diverse [12] . This required further investigation.",

Each single herb or Chinese medicine formula was set as an independent fixed prescription to estimate the support probability of all of the prescriptions in the data set containing the fixed prescription in order to measure how frequently the association rule occurred in the data set.

Chuan-Beimu is considered the best antitussive and expectorant in TCM. Zhe-Beimu contains a cholic acid-verticinoneester that may regulate central opioid receptors; thus, its excellent antitussive and expectorant effects are believed to be superior to those of codeine phosphate [46] . Extant studies had shown that Ban-Lan-Gen (Radix Isatidis) possesses anti-helicobacter [47] , anti-E. coli [48] , and anti-endotoxic effects [49] . Thus, we can conclude that the common Chinese herbs used to treat URTIs have antitussive and/or expectorant properties.",

These methods differ from the etiological diagnoses of Western medicine. Therefore, when selecting herbs for the treatment of disease, patient symptoms, such as appetite, thirst, and mood, play a crucial role [1] ; (3) the study did not use condition probability to explore the relationship between herbs and diseases and further analysis the different patterns of herb or herb combination; (4) the study did not record the usage of Western medication, so therefore, information for common polypharmacy was unavailable; (5) the study is limited to the use TCM theory to explain the simple descriptive statistics.
