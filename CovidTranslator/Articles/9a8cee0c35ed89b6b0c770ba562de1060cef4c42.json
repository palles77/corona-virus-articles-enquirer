In coronaviruses these homologous recognition sequences are involved in the iuitiation of transcription suggesting that there are 3 mRNA species in this region of the TGEV genome. Northern blot analysis and nuclease Sl mapping confirmed the presence of 3 mRNA species between mRNA 3 encoding the EZ-peplomer protein and mRNA 6 encoding the El-matrix protein. The 5' regions of these 3 mRNAs encode potential polypeptides of predicted molecular weight; 7859, 27744 and 9287, respectively. The potential translation product of ORF B (27744 Da) is considerably larger than previously reported and could be difficult to distinguish by size from the El-matrix protein.",

These mRNAs share the co-terminal 3' polyadenylated end of the TGEV genome and extend for different lengths in the 5' direction. This transcription mechanism has been well documented in 2 other coronaviruses, murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Lai et al., 1983; Spaan et al., 1983; Brown et al., 1984) . In addition, the 5' end of each subgenomic mRNA contains a short RNA leader sequence, derived from the 5' end of the genome, that primes transcription. This leader sequence is 72 bases long in the case of MHV and approximately 60 bases in length for IBV. The leader and the body sequences of each subgenomic mRNA are joined by a discontinuous transc~ption mechanism. The freely dissociated leader sequence binds to an intergenic recognition sequence and serves as a primer for the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (Lai, 1986) . Thus each subgenomic mRNA contains a homologous recognition sequence approximately 60-70 bases downstream from the actual 5' end. The core recognition sequence for MHV is S'AATCZAAAC and for IBV it is 5'CTEAACAA.",

This is the case for mRNAs that encode the coronavirus structural genes. For TGEV, mRNAs 3, 6 and 7 have been shown by in vitro translation studies to code for the E2-peplomer, El-matrix and nucleocapsid proteins, respectively (Jacobs et al., 1986) . In some instances for subgenomic mRNAs that do not appear to code for any of the major virion structural proteins, internal initiation of translation is thought to occur. These include mRNA D for IBV and mRNA 5 for MHV for which a 12.4 kDa IBV polypeptide and a 10.2 kDa MHV polypeptide have been shown to be translated in infected cells (Skinner et al., 1985; Smith et al., 1987) . In the case of TGEV, 2 mRNA species have been identified by Northern hybridization to be present between the E2-peplomer and El-matrix structural genes (Hu et al., 1984; Jacobs et al., 1986; . The larger of these 2 mRNAs, designated mRNA 4 by Jacobs et al.

Fig. 1 shows a Northern blot of intracellular RNAs extracted from cells infected with either unadapted or plaque-purified TGEV. Each virus produced at least 6 discrete mRNA bands with calculated sixes in kb of 8.2 (RNA 3), 4.0 (RNA 4a), 3.7 (RNA 4b), 3.1 (RNA 5), 2.8 (RNA 6), 2.0 (RNA 7). The RNAs are numbered according to Jacobs et al. (1986) . Although qualitatively identical, quantitative differences were apparent in RNAs 5 and 6 between the unadapted and the plaque-purified viruses. The genomic RNA (RNA 1) was not visualized by Northern blotting, perhaps, due to its large size and poor transfer to the nylon membrane. On the other hand, inadequate transfer could not account for the weak RNA 3 signal, the mRNA encoding the EZ-peplomer protein, because 9.5 kb and 7.5 kb RNA markers on the same gel transferred efficiently (data not shown). This indicated that mRNA 3 is synthesized to a lesser extent than the other smaller transcripts. Our Northern blot analysis identified 3 distinct transcripts between the EZpeplomer mRNA (RNA 3) and the El-matrix mRNA (RNA 6) of TGEV.",

            "text": "The nucleotide sequence for the region of the TGEV genome between the El and E2 structural protein genes was presented for the avirulent Purdue 115 strain . Two nucleotide differences between the Miller and Purdue sequences at positions 426, and 440 (Figs. 2 and 5) alter the interpretation of these sequences and suggest the existence of the third mRNA species and a larger ORF than originally postulated. A single T to C base substitution at position 426 establishes an intergenic recognition sequence S'SCTAAAC marking the approximate 5' limit of the body sequence for mRNA 4b. Fourteen bases downstream from this homologous sequence another T to G base change generates an AUG translation initiation codon in frame with ORF B of 725 bases. ORF B encodes a protein of 244 amino acid residues (predicted molecular weight 27744) in contrast to the truncated X2b polypeptide of 165 amino acid residues predicted for the Purdue strain. Consistent with these findings, we have identified in Northern blots a mRNA species (RNA 4b) with a unique 5' region of the proper size to code for this polypeptide. In addition, in vitro translation of TGEV intracellular RNAs (Purdue strain) of this size have demonstrated a 25 kDa polypeptide (Jacobs et al., 1986) . These data suggest that for TGEV each subgenomic mRNA species is functionally monocistronic at their 5' translated ends and that internal initiation of protein synthesis does not occur. In addition, the Miller and Purdue strains differ in that 2 large deletions are present in the Miller strain between the end of the E2 gene and ORF B. One, a 16 base deletion occurring in the non-coding region between E2 and ORF A, shortens this intergenic region from 121 to 105 nucleotides. The second is a 29 base deletion altering the C-terminus of the ORF A polypeptide by shifting the reading frame. This deletion occurs after base position 359 of the Purdue sequence . The length of the ORF A polypeptide is increased by one amino acid residue, and then, the C-terminal 6 amino acid residues are different (Fig. 2) .",

For all three coronaviruses the predicted translation product of the ORF immediately 5' of the El-matrix protein gene showed similarities in hydropathicity distributions and amino acid sequence homologies. Fig. 6 shows a Kyte-Doolittle plot of N-terminally aligned potential products of TGEV ORF C (82 amino acid residues), the second downstream ORF of MHV mRNA 5 (88 amino acid residues) and the third downstream ORF of IBV mRNA D (109 amino acid residues). The additional length at the C-terminal hydrophilic end of the IBV polypeptide varies in different IBV serotypes (Cavanagh and Davis, 1988) . Both the predicted MHV and IBV polypeptides have been detected in infected cell lysates (Skinner et al., 198.5; Smith et al., 1987) . The conserved hydrophobic patterns of these polypeptides and the potential translation product of TGEV ORF C suggest that each protein might perform analogous functions in the replication of coronaviruses. The amino acid sequence homologies were 23% between the predicted polypeptide of TGEV ORF C and the MHV polypeptide and 22% between the TGEV translation product and the polypeptide predicted for the IBV ORF.",

Sequencing studies predict a molecular weight of 27800 for the mature El protein . The postulated primary translation product encoded by ORF B, molecular weight 27744, is almost identical in size to El, perhaps, preventing the resolution of these proteins on gels. At this time we cannot rule out the possibility that the ORF B protein may contribute to the observed El size heterogeneity. Even after N-linked glycosylation is blocked in TGEV-infected cells with tunicamycin, 2 protein bands remain in the El region of the gel (Hu et al., 1984; Jacobs et al., 1986) . One of these protein bands is El but it is possible that the other could be the product of ORF B. In addition, some caution should be exercised in assigning monoclonal antibody specificity to the El protein simply on the basis of size because the El-matrix protein and the product encoded by ORF B could appear as similar proteins on SDS gels following immunoprecipitation.",
