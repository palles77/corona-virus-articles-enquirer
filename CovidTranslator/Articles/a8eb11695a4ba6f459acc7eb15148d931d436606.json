The goal of myogenic stem cell transplant therapy for DMD is to increase dystrophin expression in existing muscle fibers and to provide a source of stem cells for future muscle generation. Although syngeneic myogenic stem cell transplants have been successful in mice, allogeneic transplants of myogenic stem cells were ineffective in several human trials. To determine whether allogeneic muscle progenitor cells can be successfully transplanted in an immune-tolerant recipient, we induced immune tolerance in two DMD-affected (cxmd) dogs through hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Injection of freshly isolated muscle-derived cells from the HCT donor into either fully or partially chimeric xmd recipients restored dystrophin expression up to 6.48% of wild-type levels, reduced the number of centrally located nuclei, and improved muscle structure. Dystrophin expression was maintained for at least 24 weeks. Taken together, these data indicate that immune tolerance to donor myoblasts provides an important platform from which to further improve myoblast transplantation, with the goal of restoring dystrophin expression to patients with DMD.",

Indeed, intramuscular injection of adult satellite cell-derived myoblasts from a normal syngeneic donor into mdx mice results in the formation of dystrophin-positive muscle fibers. [3] [4] [5] [6] However, smallscale human clinical trials reveal that intramuscular injection of donor myoblasts results in transient expression of dystrophin in a small number of recipient muscle fibers. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] In the absence of immunosuppression, injection of donor myoblasts triggers cellular immune responses that destroy newly formed donor myotubes. 13 Immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine (CSP) and FK506, inhibit calcineurin activity and prevent graft rejection. Yet, patients treated with CSP do not display an increased number of dystrophin-positive myofibers relative to patients receiving placebo. 10 It has been established that CSP alone is not potent enough to prevent graft rejection; additionally, CSP may negatively affect myoblast engraftment, as calcineurin activity is essential for myogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. 14, 15 More important, chronic systemic immunosuppression is associated with serious side effects and considerable risk. Taken together, these observations indicate that myogenic stem cell transplant therapy requires an alternative to traditional immunosuppression.",

[18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Specifically, donor kidneys transplanted into mixed chimeric canine recipients were fully functional and remained intact for at least 5 years, even when only 10% of lymphocytes within the recipient were of donor origin. Therefore, we sought to determine whether HCT could be used to establish an immune-tolerant, random-bred, large animal model of DMD for preclinical myogenic stem cell transplantation studies. The canine model of DMD (cxmd) is characterized by a point mutation in the consensus splice acceptor site in intron 6 of the dystrophin gene, introducing a stop codon within the modified reading frame, resulting in a near complete absence of dystrophin protein. [24] [25] [26] The dystrophic phenotype of the cxmd canine faithfully recapitulates the human disease, making this an ideal model for investigating potential therapies. HCT alone is unable to restore dystrophin expression to cxmd canines. 27 Therefore, we specifically asked whether myeloablative and nonmyeloablative HCT in cxmd canines would permit donor-derived myogenic stem cells to stably engraft and restore dystrophin expression.",

            "text": "Finding a clinically relevant means of restoring long-term expression of dystrophin to skeletal muscle has been a continuing challenge in the field of DMD research. Transplantation of normal myoblasts into human patients was unsuccessful because of immune rejection of donor cells. While long-term immunosuppression might lengthen muscle cell survival, it is toxic to many organs, including kidneys, liver, muscle, bone, and the central nervous system, and leaves patients vulnerable to opportunistic infections. In this study, we demonstrated that HCT established immune tolerance in cxmd canines, permitting stable engraftment of donor musclederived cells in the absence of pharmacological immunosuppression. Importantly, donor muscle-derived cells restored dystrophin expression for at least 24 weeks following transplantation. Although dystrophin protein was detected extensively throughout cryosections from muscle biopsies obtained after cell injection, the level of dystrophin transcript was relatively low. Notably, it has been suggested in exon-skipping studies that in-frame dystrophin mRNA needs to achieve only 10% of total dystrophin levels to revert affected muscle to a mild Becker phenotype. 30 However, it is possible that the level of mRNA observed may not accurately reflect the level of protein present. 31 Although dystrophin protein is easily detected by antibody staining of muscle cryosections, dystrophin is estimated to represent <0.01% of cytoplasmic RNA present in adult skeletal muscle, 32 suggesting that the muscle fiber may produce only limiting amounts of dystrophin transcript, yet translate the message efficiently into protein. As such, measuring the level of dystrophin transcript may not accurately represent the level of functional dystrophin protein.",

In our study, we demonstrate that injection of 10-to 20-fold fewer freshly isolated cells resulted in dystrophin-expressing fibers that encompassed ~30-70% of fibers within the region of injection. Importantly, sustained engraftment did not depend on immunosuppression. This is a crucial distinction, as side effects of FK506 treatment include tremors, hypertension, renal dysfunction, hypomagnesemia, neurological toxicity, and long-term toxicity to liver and kidneys.",

Furthermore, dystrophin expression was clearly restored in both chimeric dogs. Given that HCT induces tolerance to other organs, such as the kidney, lung, and small intestine, the small number of animals in this study nonetheless represent a definitive demonstration of allogeneic tolerance to donor muscle-derived cells and Myeloablative bone marrow transplantation in an cxmd recipient (G289) was followed by intramuscular injection of muscle-derived cells from the marrow donor. Cryosections from donor muscle, recipient muscle preinjection, and recipient muscle 10 weeks after injection of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cultured cells were stained using an antibody specific for dystrophin (green). 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to visualize nuclei (blue). (b) Injection of cultured cells into mixed chimeric cxmd canine. Nonmyeloablative bone marrow transplantation in an cxmd recipient (G604) was followed by intramuscular injection of muscle-derived cells from the marrow donor. Cryosections from donor muscle, recipient muscle preinjection, and recipient muscle 24 weeks after injection of 3.0 \u00d7 10 6 cultured cells were stained using an antibody specific for dystrophin (green). DAPI was used to visualize nuclei (blue). provides an important model from which to further improve dystrophin expression after myogenic cell transplantation. Achieving greater dystrophin expression requires improving donor muscle-derived cell engraftment. Chimeric cxmd canines provide a model in which to optimize donor muscle-derived cell isolation methods and test molecules that stimulate donor cell proliferation or reprogram recipient muscle to enhance fusion. More than 40 years of success in translating results from canines to humans in the clinic highlights that HCT is a clinically relevant platform from which to study and improve myoblast transplantation.",
