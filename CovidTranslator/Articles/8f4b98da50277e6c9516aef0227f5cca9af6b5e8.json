It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika in the near future, but unfortunately so far there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika. In particular, the special concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue arising from antibody-dependent enhancement strongly emphasizes the key role of its NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) as a target for anti-Zika drug discovery/design due to its absolutely-essential role in viral replication.",

Zika virus shares a high degree of sequence and structural homology with other flaviviruses particularly Dengue virus, thus resulting in immunological cross-reactivity (7). As such, Zika was proposed as the fifth member of the Dengue serocomplex. Seriously, the current Zika outbreaks are largely localized within dengue-endemic areas, it is thus possible that preexisting dengue-induced antibodies may enhance Zika infection by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a factor that makes the vaccine approaches extremely challenging (7). Zika genome is translated into a single ~3,500-residue polyprotein, which is further cleaved into 3 structural proteins and 7 non-structural proteins (11) . The correct processing of the polyprotein is essential for replication of all flaviviruses, which requires both host proteases and a viral NS2B-NS3 protease (NS2B-NS3pro) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) . As a consequence, the flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro has been well-established to be key targets for developing antiviral All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

In particular, the unique concern on the vaccine treatment to Zika and Dengue strongly emphasizes the irreplaceable role of the Zika protease as a target for antiviral drug discovery/design. As facilitated by our previous studies on Dengue NS2B-NS3pro (12), we started to work on Zika NS2B-NS3pro immediately after the outbreak of Zika and now successfully obtained several active forms of recombinant Zika NS2B-NS3pro. Furthermore, we attempted to discover its inhibitors from eatable plants and traditional herbal medicines to fight Zika with no delay. Here we release the result that quercetin, a flavonoid existing in many fruits and vegetables, inhibits Zika NS2B-NS3pro, and subsequently determined its inhibitory activity. For the first time, our study reveals that many fruits, vegetables, leaves and grains, as well as herbals containing quercetin are expected to have anti-Zika activity, and therefor can join in to combat Zika immediately.",

We are currently focused on decoding whether quercetin in fact acts as a dynamically-driven allosteric inhibitor as previously observed on other viral proteins (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) . Furthermore, we also attempted to utilize NMR spectroscopy to facilitate the optimization of the inhibitors (26-31). Quercetin is a flavonoid extensively found in many fruits, vegetables, leaves and grains, which have been used as an ingredient in supplements, beverages, or foods. It has been previously documented that quercetin has beneficial health effects ranging from antioxidant to nutraceutical (32). Recently it has also been shown that herbal medicines containing quercetin or quercetin-like molecules showed significant antiviral activities on SARS and Dengue viruses (33-35). Here, for the first time, we provide the experimental evidence that quercetin is also an inhibitor of Zika NS2B-NS3pro, which is absolutely essential for cleaving the Zika polyprotein into functional subunits.

Chemical structure of quercetin extensively existing in many fruits and vegetables including Papaya (B). Here we identified quercetin to be an inhibitor of Zika NS2B-NS3pro (C); thus suggesting that fruits and vegetables containing quercetin have anti-Zika activity (D).Therefore we further determined the IC 50 and K i values of quercetin. Briefly, for determination of IC 50 , the protease at 50 nM was pre-incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min with quercetin at various concentrations and the reaction was initiated by adding Bz-nKRR-AMC to 250 \u03bc M. The obtained data(Fig 2B)were fitted to be 26.Ki determination, the assay was performed with different final concentrations of both quercetin and substrate. The protease at 50 nM was pre-incubated with quercetin at different concentrations for 30 min at 37 \u00baC. Subsequently, the reaction was initiated by addition of the corresponding concentration series of the substrate. The Ki was obtained to be All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
