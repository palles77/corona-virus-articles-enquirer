The large gene and other biological molecule syntheses have promising applications in several areas such as combinatorial biology, gene therapy, DNA immunization for antibody and antisera production, and gene expression.

This became very obvious when our group built a first generation microfluidic microarray system, which had a simple square geometry for both the fluid delivery microchannels and synthesis microreactors (17) . In this original device, highly non-uniform flow was discovered in the middle as well as corner sections of the microfluidic platform.",

In particular, Commenge et al., 2002 (12) suggested that a parallel microchannel structure may exhibit poor flow distribution uniformity which, in turn, significantly limit microreactor functions. To alleviate this problem, the effects of the geometrical dimensions of the microchannel reactors (i.e., length, width, and thickness) on the velocity distribution between channels were studied and the optimal dimensions were found. This study was carried out using an approximate pressure drop model of which fluid distribution was validated against finite-volume calculations. Further, Griffini and Gavriilidis, 2007 (18) used 2D and 3D-CFD models to study how different microchannel plate designs affected fluid flow uniformity and conclude that changing the microchannel's geometry can significantly improve the flow uniformity. In addition to these researchers' work, several studies have been done on searching for the manifold and header designs that can equalize the flow distribution in microchannels (19)- (20) .",

Then, the fluorescent dye was pumped into the microarray, which was initially filled with isopropyl alcohol. The chip adapter was then placed under an imaging camera to take images. Figure 3 displays the line profile taken from one column of microreactors of the microfluidic device. The x-axis denotes the distance from the flow inlet along the line probe in the middle of a column of the microreactors. The yaxis represents the fluorescent intensity indicating the amount of the fluorescent dye present in the area. As can be seen, the alcohol has been replaced by fluorescent dye less in the middle region of the chip (less fluorescent intensity) than in the inlet and outlet regions. This observation indicates the inconsistency of the flow pattern from the inlet region to the middle of the device, and to the outlet region.",

In this figure, the velocity contour is extracted from the middle plane of microreactors. The gray color represents the velocity along the +x axis direction to the left while the black color displays the velocity in the opposite direction. The fluid flows in from the top channel, then distributes to microreactors, and finally departs through the bottom channel.

This velocity contour along a line probe in the y-axis direction at the middle of microreactors is also plotted in Figure 6 . Each lobe of the plot represents a velocity profile inside a microreactor unit. The left flow velocity profile shows all positive U values.

The primary goal of the study is to investigate the geometrical effects on the flow profile uniformity in the microfluidic microarrays. With the model developed in this work, simulations are run according to the geometric parameter values, shown in Table 1 . The velocity profile along the line probe at the middle plane of the microreactors is extracted. The velocities in the x-axis direction (U) of all 7 microreactor columns from the model are superimposed in middle plot in Figure 7 for the nominal parameters. The uniformity of the flow profile in each individual column happens when the maximum velocities of microreactors (the peaks of each velocity lobe) to be of the same magnitude along the line probe. Additionally, the uniformity across all columns requires the velocity plots of all of the left flow columns (+U values) lay on top of each other presenting only one distinct plot as well as the right flow column (\u2212U values) velocity plots exactly match each other resulting in another plot which is a negative mirror image of the left flow column plot. Because the plots in Figure 7 do not conform to the uniformity conditions, we can conclude from Figure 7 that there exist velocity differences in both the flows across columns and within the same column. Higher velocities occur in the corners of microreactors whereas the low velocities happen more in the middle of the microarray. This velocity profile is consistent with a normalized velocity distribution in 23 microchannel model in the paper by Commenge et al., 2002 (12) in which the authors studied geometric effects on flow uniformity in microchannel reactors. Furthermore, similar geometric effect was observed in electric field distribution of DNA biochip study by Kassegne et al., 2003 (6) . Figure 7 also shows the velocity profile when microreactor depth is varied. The top graph is the velocity plot when microreactor depth is increased while the bottom one presents the velocity profile when microreactor depth is decreased. By comparing these plots in Figure 7 , the flow pattern appears more uniform between each column as well as between each microreactor row as a result of microreactor depth decreasing. Therefore, this simulation result suggests that the flow uniformity can be improved by decreasing the microreactor depth.",

The coefficient of variation (CV, the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) of these velocities from the model are calculated for every simulation run in order to quantify the velocity uniformity in which low coefficient of variations imply better fluid flow uniformity.

The coefficient of variation of this case, also shown in Figure 9 , is 15.76% which is significantly higher than the normal value case with the microreactor inlet/outlet. Furthermore, we can conclude that the flow uniformity could be improved by decreasing the width of microreactor inlet/outlet and the microreactor depth, and also by increasing the length of microreactor inlet/outlet channels, the microchannel width, and the microchannel depth. Moreover, the flow uniformity is most sensitive to the variations in microchannel width, microchannel depth, and microreactor depth.

On the other hand, in the bottom figure of uniform flow pattern, most of the pressure drops only occur across the microreactors. This observation and the conclusion inferred earlier from the parametric study suggest that the flow uniformity could be improved by increasing the pressure drop across the microreactors relatively to the microchannels. However, some limitations in the fabrication process and operating procedure prevent us from extensively increasing the pressure drop; for example, too tiny geometry could cause a clogging problem from contaminated particles during synthesis cycles.
