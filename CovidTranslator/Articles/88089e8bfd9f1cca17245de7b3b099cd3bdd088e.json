Nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) is a cofactor of the NS3 serine protease and has been demonstrated to inhibit protein synthesis. In this study, GST pull-down assay was performed to examine potential cellular factors that interact with the NS4A protein and are involved in the pathogenesis of HCV. A trypsin digestion followed by LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that one of the GST-NS4A-interacting proteins to be eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A). Both the N-terminal domain of NS4A from amino acid residues 1-20, and the central domain from residues 21-34 interacted with eEF1A, but the central domain was the key player involved in the NS4A-mediated translation inhibition. NS4A(21-34) diminished both cap-dependent and HCV IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner. The translation inhibitory effect of NS4A(21-34) was relieved by the addition of purified recombinant eEF1A in an in vitro translation system. Taken together, NS4A inhibits host and viral translation through interacting with eEF1A, implying a possible mechanism by which NS4A is involved in the pathogenesis and chronic infection of HCV.",

An NS4B cDNA fragment was amplified from pCRII-Topo-NS(3c-5An) with primer set 5\u00a2-GGAATTCCATATGGCCTCA CACCTCCCTTACATCGAACAA-3\u00a2 and 5\u00a2-CGGGATCCTCTAGATCAGCATGGCGT GGAGCAGTCTTCATT-3\u00a2, and cloned into pCR \u00d2 II-TOPO to generate plasmid pCRII-Topo-NS4B. Plasmid pcDNA-HCV-SG represents a subgenomic replicon of HCV genomic type 1b and consists of the HCV-IRES, the neo gene, and the EMCV-IRES fused to the HCV sequences from NS3 to NS5B and the 3\u00a2 noncoding region. These plasmids were used to generate expression plasmids of HCV NS3, NS4A and NS4B proteins.",

            "text": "(ii) Plasmids pCMV-Tag2C-NS4A and pGST-NS4A. For generation of pCMV-Tag2C-NS4A, a full-length NS4A cDNA was amplified from pCRII-Topo-NS(3c-5An) with the primer set 5\u00a2-CGGGATCCATATG AGCACCTGGGTGCTTGTA-3\u00a2 and 5\u00a2-GGA ATTCAGCACTCCTCCATTTC-3\u00a2, the PCR fragment was digested with Bam-HI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases, and cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pCMV-Tag2C (Stratagene). For generation of plasmid pGST-NS4A, plasmid pCMV-Tag2C-NS4A was digested with BamHI and treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I prior to a further digestion with XhoI restriction endonuclease. The resulting fragment was inserted into the pGEX-6p-1 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) from which the polylinker sequences between BamHI and XhoI had been deleted and the BamHI site blunted. (iii) Plasmids pcDNA-NS4A-V5HisTopo, pc DNA-NS3-V5HisTopo, and pcDNA-NS4B-V5HisTopo. For generation of plasmid pcDNA-NS4A-V5HisTopo, cDNA sequence of the full-length NS4A was amplified from pCMV- Tag2C-NS4A with the primer set 5\u00a2-CACCATGAGCACCTGGGTGCTTGTA3\u00a2 and 5\u00a2-GCACTCCTCCATTTCATC-3\u00a2, and cloned into pcDNA TM 3.1D/V5-His-TOPO \u00d2 (Invitrogen). For generation of pc DNA-NS3-V5HisTopo and pcDNA-NS4B-V5His-Topo, full length cDNA fragments of the HCV NS3 and NS4B were amplified from pcDNA-HCV-SG with the primer set 5\u00a2-CACCATGGCGCCCATCACTGCCTACG CTCAACAGA-3\u00a2 and 5\u00a2-CGTGAC-GACCTCCAGGTCAGCTGCCATGCAT GT-3\u00a2, and the primer set 5\u00a2-CAC CATGGCCTGACACCTCCCTTACATC GAACAA-3\u00a2 and 5\u00a2-GCATGGCGT GGAGCAGTCTTCATTA-3\u00a2, respectively, the resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pcDNA TM (vi) Plasmids pcDNA-eEF1A-V5HisTopo, pcD NA-eEF1A(1-240)-V5HisTopo, pcDNA-eEF1A(201-462)-V5HisTopo, and pcDNA-eEF1A-HisTopo. For generation of plasmids pcDNA-eEF1A-V5HisTopo and its deletion mutants, RNA was isolated from Huh7 cells by a single step extraction method as described previously [17] . The RNA was used to perform RT-PCR with primers sets described below and the resulting cDNA fragments were cloned into pcDNA TM 3.1D/V5-His-TOPO \u00d2 . The primer sets used in the amplification were EF-K (5\u00a2-CAC CATGGGAAAGGAAAAGA CTC-3\u00a2) and EF-R (5\u00a2-TTTAGCCTTCTGAGCTTTCT GG-3\u00a2) for generating pcDNA-eEF1A-V5HisTopo that represents V5His-tagged full length eEF1A, EF-K and EF-NR (5\u00a2-ACGAGTTGGTGGTAGGAT3\u00a2) for generating pcDNA-eEF1A(1-240)-V5HisTopo that represents V5His-tagged N-terminal eEF1A from amino acid residues 1-240, and EF-MK (5\u00a2-CACCATGCTGGAGCCAAG TGCTAA-3\u00a2) and EF-R for generating pcDNA-eEF1A(201-462)-V5HisTopo that represents V5His-tagged C-terminal eEF1A from amino acid residues 201-462. For generation of plasmid pcDNA-eEF1A-HisTopo, the V5-epitope was removed from pcDNA-eEF1A-V5HisTopo following a digestion with XhoI and AgeI restriction endonucleases and the ends were blunted with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I prior to self-ligation. (vii) Plasmids pGST-NS3, pGST-NS4B, and pGST-eEF1A. For construction of pGST-NS3, plasmid pcDNA-NS3-V5HisTopo was digested with NcoI and treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I prior to a further digestion with XhoI restriction endonuclease. The resulting fragment was inserted into the pGEX-6p-1 from which the polylinker sequences between EcoRI and XhoI had been deleted and the EcoRI site blunted. A similar approach was taken to generate pGST-eEF1A from pcDNA-eEF1A-V5HisTopo. For generation of plasmid pGST-NS4B, pCRII-Topo-NS4B described earlier was digested with EcoRI restriction endonuclease and the resulting NS4B-containing fragment was inserted into the EcoRI site of pGEX-6p-1. (viii) Deletion mutants of the plasmid pGST-NS4A. For construction of plasmids pGST-NS4A(1-34) and pGST-NS4A(21-54), cDNA fragments were obtained by PCR-amplification from pGST-NS4A with primer set 5 \u00a2 -CGGGATCCATATGAGCACCTGGGTGC TTGTA-3 \u00a2 and 5 \u00a2 -GGAATTCACTT CCCGGACAAGAT-3 \u00a2 and primer set 5 \u00a2 -GGAATTCCATATGGGCAGCGTGGTCA TTGT-3 and 5 \u00a2 -GGAATTCAGCACTCCTC CATTTC-3 \u00a2 , respectively, and the resultant fragments were digested with NdeI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases. For construction of plasmids pGST-NS4A(1-20), pGST-NS4A (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) , and pGST-NS4A(35-54), cDNA fragments with NdeI and EcoRI recognition sequences at the 5 \u00a2 and 3 \u00a2 ends, respectively, were generated by annealing the following synthetic oligonucleotide sets: 5 \u00a2 -TATGAGCACCTGGGTGCTTGTAGGCG GGGTCCTTGCAGCTCTGGCCGCATAC TG-3 \u00a2 and 5 \u00a2 -AATTCACGTTGTCAGG CAGTATGCGGCCAGAGCTGCAAGGAC CCCGCCTACAAGCACCCAGGTGCTCA-3 \u00a2 for pGST-NS4A(1-20), 5 \u00a2 -TATGGG CAGCGTGGTCATTGTGGGCAGGATC ATCTTGTCC GGGAAGTG-3 \u00a2 and 5 \u00a2 -AATTCACTTCCCGGACAAGATGATC CTGCCCACAATGACCACGCTGCCCA-3 \u00a2 for pGST-NS 4A (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) , and 5 \u00a2 -TA TGCCGGCTGTCATTCCTGATAGGGA GGTTCTCTACCGGGAGTTCGATGAAA TGGAGGAGTGCTG -3 \u00a2 and 5 \u00a2 -AATTMC AGCACTCCTCCATTTCATCGAACTCC CGGTAGAGAACCTCCCTATCAGGAAT GACAGCCGGCA-3 \u00a2 for pGST-NS4A (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) . These cDNA fragments were used to replace the cognate fragment of pGST-NS4A to generate the deletion mutants of GST-NS4A.",

By performing cotransfection experiments with an HCV NS3-, NS4A-, or NS4B-encoding plasmid and a cap-dependent monocistronic luciferase reporter into Huh7 cells, pecific inhibitory effects of NS4A and NS4B on the cap-dependent translation were detected in this study. The luciferase activity was significantly reduced when the reporter plasmid was coexpressed with NS4A or NS4B protein (Figure 2a ). In addition, the effects correlated very well with the protein levels of luciferase (Figure 2b ), whereas the luciferase mRNA level was not affected by the HCV nonstructural proteins (Figure 2c ). Possible effects of the viral nonstructural proteins on HCV IRES-mediated translation were further examined by cotransfecting into Huh7 cells a bicistronic reporter that consists of the Renilla luciferase, the HCV IRES (genotype 1b), and the firefly luciferase genes. Two days posttransfection, Dual-Glo TM luciferase assay (Promega) was performed. Renilla luciferase activity represents the cap-dependent translation and firefly luciferase activity represents the HCV IRES-mediated translation. The results demonstrated that both NS4A and NS4B inhibited HCV IRES-mediated translation to levels similar to those of the cap-dependent translation, whereas no effect was detected with the viral NS3 protein (Figure 2d ). We proposed that through interacting with eEF1A, HCV NS4A protein may deplete or interfere eEF1A in forming functional complexes involved in both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the specificity of the interaction between NS4A and eEF1A. GST fusion proteins of the viral NS3, NS4A, and NS4B were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) in the presence of IPTG, and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Figure 3a) . GST pull-down assay was performed with Huh7 cell extracts followed by Western blot analysis with anti-eEF1A antibody. The results demonstrated that NS4A but neither NS3 nor NS4B interacted with eEF1A in the GST pulldown system (Figure 3b) . To examine the interaction in culture cells, cotransfection experiments were performed in Huh7 cells with plasmids encoding V5-tagged NS4A (pcDNA-NS4A-V5) or NS4B (pcDNA-NS4B-V5) and a His-tagged eEF1A (pcDNA-eEF1A-HisTopo). Two days posttransfection, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-His antibody followed by Western blot analysis with anti-V5 antibody. As shown in Figure 3c , NS4A but not NS4B was coimmunoprecipitated with the eEF1A. These results indicate that, although both NS4A and NS4B are capable of inhibiting protein synthesis, binding to eEF1A is a unique characteristic of NS4A. It is likely that NS4A and NS4B inhibit protein translation through different mechanisms.",

To link the interaction between NS4A and eEF1A to the effect of NS4A on protein synthesis, translation inhibition assay was performed. Huh7 cells were cotransfected with the monocistronic luciferase reporter and a plasmid representing NS4A(1-34) or NS4A (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) . Two days posttransfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for the luciferase activity and the levels of luciferase protein and mRNA. As shown in Figure 5 , NS4A(1-34) inhibited both the luciferase activity and luciferase protein to levels compatible to the full-length NS4A protein did but had little effect on the level of luciferase mRNA. These results indicated that the N-terminal 34 amino acid residues are responsible for the inhibitory effect of NS4A on translation. To determine which of the The inhibitory effects of NS4A and NS4B proteins on cap-dependent translation. Plasmids pcDNA-NS3-V5, pcDNA-NS4A-V5, and pcDNA-NS4B-V5 encoding HCV NS3, NS4A, and NS4B, respectively, were independently cotransfected into Huh7 cells with the monocistronic luciferase reporter plasmid pCMV-Luc. Two days posttransfection, cell lysates were harvested and equal amounts of the proteins were used to perform luciferase assay (panel a) and Western blot analysis (panel b). Meanwhile, total RNA was isolated to perform RT-PCR (panel c). Luciferase activities derived from the transfected cells were normalized by the activity of the cells cotransfected with pCMV-Luc and pcDNA3.1(+) control vector. The results represent the average of four independent experiments. Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies specific to luciferase and GAPDH as indicated. Intensities of the luciferase proteins were normalized in each set against the intensity of GAPDH and compared to the control. Relative intensities of the luciferase protein are shown. RT-PCR of luciferase mRNA was performed with oligo-dT and primers as described in the materials and methods for 20 amplification cycles. Intensities of the luciferase cDNA fragment were normalized in each set against the intensity of GAPDH and relative intensities as compared to the vector control are shown. (d) The inhibitory effects of NS4A and NS4B proteins on HCV IRES-mediated translation. The bicistronic luciferase reporter plasmid pJSS12 was cotransfected independently with the HCV NS3-, NS4A-, and NS4B-encoding plasmid. The activities of Renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase that representing cap-dependent and HCV IRES-mediated translation, respectively, were analyzed 2 days posttransfection with Dual-Glo TM Luciferase Assay System as described in the Materials and methods. Relative luciferase activities in the presence of the HCV nonstructural proteins were calculated by normalization of the activities in each set to that of the cells cotransfected with the reporter plasmid and pcDNA3.1(+) control vector. two eEF1A-interacting domains, NS4A(1-20) and NS4A (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) , is essential for the translation inhibition, GST-NS4A and its deletion mutant proteins were purified (Figure 6a ) and used to perform a translation inhibition assay in a cell-free system. Increasing amounts of the purified GST fusion proteins were pre-incubated with RRL followed by in vitro translation reaction with the monocistronic luciferase mRNA as the reporter. The results demonstrated that both the GST-NS4A and GST-NS4A(21-34) significantly reduced the luciferase activity, whereas the effects of GST-NS4A(1-20) and GST-NS4A(35-54) proteins were negligible (Figure 6b ). In addition, the GST-NS4A(21-34) protein had a stronger effect on the translation inhibition than that of the wild type. It required less than half amount of GST-NS4A(21-34) protein to reach a 50%-inhibition when compared with the full-length NS4A protein (4.29 \u00c2 10 13 moles for full-length and 1.81 \u00c2 10 13 moles for the subdomain 21-34). The effects of NS4A subdomains on the translation inhibition were also examined by analyzing the level of luciferase protein following an in-vitro-translation reaction in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine and 2 \u00c2 10 13 moles of the NS4A proteins. As shown in Figure 6c , GST-NS4A(21-34) had a greater effect than the GST-NS4A(1-20) whereas GST-NS4A(35-54) had no effect on the translation inhibition. BL21(DE3) . Following a partial purification, the GST fusion proteins immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie blue staining is shown. (b) eEF1A specifically copurified with GST-NS4A. Huh7 cell extracts were incubated with partially purified GST-fusion proteins as indicated, followed by GST pull-down assay and Western blot analysis with antibody specific to eEF1A. Cell extract control represents Huh7 cell extract that was loaded directly onto the gel to serve as a control. (c) Interaction between NS4A and eEF1A in transfected culture cells. Plasmids pcDNA-NS4A-V5 and pcDNA-NS4B-V5 that encode V5 epitope-tagged NS4A and NS4B proteins, respectively, were independently cotransfected into Huh7 cells with plasmid pcDNA-eEF1A-HisTopo that encodes a His-tagged fusion protein of the fulllength eEF1A (eEF1A-His). Cell lysates were prepared 2 days posttransfection to perform coimmunoprecipitation assay with antibodies against the His-tag of eEF1A-His protein and Western blot analysis with antibodies specific to the V5-epitope to detect V5-tagged NS4A and NS4B proteins. Input lanes represent 5 % of the cell lysates used in the coimmunoprecipitation assay and were loaded directly onto the gel to serve as positive controls of Western blot analysis. The effect of NS4A on the translation inhibition may be resulted from a competition between NS4A and translation factors that are involved in forming functional translation complexes with eEF1A. We therefore examined GST and GST fusion proteins of the wild-type NS4A and its deletion mutants were eluted out from the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. eEF1A was purified from bead-bound GST-eEF1A following a cleavage with PreScission TM Protease and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) as described in the Materials and methods. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie blue staining is shown. (b)-(c) Cap-dependent in-vitro-translation inhibition assay. Various amounts of the purified GST fusion proteins as indicated in panel b or 2 \u00c2 10 13 moles of the GST fusion proteins as indicated in panel c were pre-incubated with RRL for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Translation reaction was then carried out at 30\u00b0C following addition of the monocistronic luciferase mRNA, amino acid mixtures, and RNase inhibitor in the absence (panel b) or presence (panel c) of [ 35 S]methionine. The translation products were subjected to luciferase activity assay (panel b) or SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (panel c). Relative luciferase activities were calculated by normalization of the luciferase activities in the presence of the GST and GST-NS4A proteins to that without any GST proteins. Relative intensities of the luciferase protein were normalized against the intensity of luciferase protein in the presence of GST. (d) Translation restore experiments. GST fusion proteins of 2 \u00c2 10 13 moles were preincubated with RRL for 1 h at 4\u00b0C followed by an additional incubation for 30 min in the presence of 0.5 lg purified recombinant eEF1A. In-vitro-translation reaction was then performed. The ability of the purified eEF1A to restore the translation inhibition was analyzed by luciferase activity assay. Relative luciferase activities as compared to that of GST in the absence of exogenous eEF1A are shown. The result represents the average of two independent experiments. (e) HCV IRES-mediated in-vitro-translation inhibition assay. Various amounts of the NS4A(21-34) peptide as indicated were preincubated with RRL for 30 min at 4\u00b0C prior to the in-vitro-translation reaction. In-vitro-translation reaction was performed as described in the legend to panel b except that the bicistronic luciferase reporter mRNA and NS4A(21-34) peptide were used. Luciferase activities of Renilla and firefly that represent cap-dependent and HCV IRES-mediated translation, respectively, were analyzed and normalized in each set against the luciferase activity of the reaction without addition of the NS4A(21-34) peptide.",

But the steady state levels of eIF4G, eIF4E, PABP, and 4E-BP1 were not affected [16] . The molecular basis involved in the inhibitory effect of NS4A was not clear. In this study, we found that HCV NS4A protein specifically interacted with the translation elongation factor, eEF1A (Figures 1 and 3) . The N-terminal and the central domains of the NS4A were involved independently in the interaction (Figure 4 ), but the central domain encompassing amino acid residues 21-34 played a major role in the inhibition of the cap-dependent and HCV IRES-mediated translation (Figures 6b, c, and e) . The translation inhibitory effect caused by the NS4A(21-34) could be relieved by the addition of purified recombinant eEF1A into the translation system (Figure 6d) . Nevertheless, the translation inhibition was not fully restored, suggesting that binding of NS4A to the eEF1A may simultaneously deplete other translation factors that are associated with eEF1A. Alternatively, other mechanisms may also involve in the inhibitory effect of NS4A. In addition, although both HCV NS4A and NS4B proteins were shown to inhibit translation ( Figure 2 , and [15, 16] ), no interaction was detected between eEF1A and HCV NS4B protein ( Figure 3) . These indicate that NS4B inhibits translation through a mechanism different from that of the NS4A protein. Recently, the interaction between eEF1A and HCV NS4A protein was also identified by yeasttwo hybrid screening [25] .",

Functional roles of the interactions are not completely understood, but the interactions were proposed to be involved in the regulation of viral replication, translation, and assembly. eEF1A is a G protein that recruits aminoacyl-tRNA to the elongating ribosomes. However, accumulated information leads us to believe that components of the translational apparatus also play important roles beyond protein synthesis. eEF1A couples the pathways of protein synthesis and degradation. It interacts with ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome following ATP depletion and is involved in the proteasome-mediated cotranslational protein degradation [29] . It was also demonstrated that eEF1A interacts with actin and is essential for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology [30] [31] [32] [33] . In addition, overexpression of eEF1A is associated with oncogenic transformation and metastasis [34] [35] [36] . In this study, we found that HCV NS4A protein interacted with eEF1A and inhibited protein synthesis. The interaction may result in a reduction of viral translation and replication leading to the escape of immune responses and establishment of chronic infection. On the other hand, the interaction may also link the un-conventional roles of eEF1A to the pathogenesis of HCV NS4A protein.",

Further deletion analysis indicated that the central domain of NS4A from amino acid residues 21-34 [GST-NS4A(21-34)] is sufficient for the binding of eEF1A. In addition, NS4A(1-20) represents a second domain that, independent of NS4A(21-34), is capable of interacting with eEF1A.",
