The assay uses highly sensitive thin-\u00a2lm detection methods, coupled with speci\u00a2c monoclonal antibodies to the nucleoprotein. The test is simple to perform, requires no instrumentation and is intended to provide a result within 15 min of test initiation in the`point-of-care' environment. In initial clinical studies, the assay was demonstrated to be equivalent to culture in identifying infected individuals. Subsequent independent studies using a variety of sample types have demonstrated sensitivity ranging from 48 to 100% and speci\u00a2cities ranging from 93 to 97%. In addition to detecting human strains, this assay has been demonstrated to be capable of detecting a variety of avian and non-human mammalian in\u00a3uenza viruses. The FLU OIA test has been used in large-scale surveillance schemes intended to provide rapid epidemiological data during normal in\u00a3uenza seasons and has demonstrated the potential for ful\u00a2lling a similar role for multispecies surveillance in, for example, conditions that o\u00a1er challenges for conventional virus isolation methods. Conceivably, such use should facilitate the timely recognition of in\u00a3uenza outbreaks and prioritization of positive specimens for more conventional, laboratory characterization, leading to improved interpandemic surveillance and rapid reaction in the face of the next pandemic.",

Second, recognition of in\u00a3uenza in the clinic precedes specimen collection, laboratory isolation and subtyping of the virus in support of national or international surveillance e\u00a1orts. The former process obviously has immediate bene\u00a2t for disease alleviation and containment whereas the latter is crucial for the recognition of emerging subtypes for determination of annual vaccine composition and timely identi\u00a2cation of viruses with pandemic potential.",

Di\u00a1erentiation of true in\u00a3uenza from diseases caused by other respiratory pathogens therefore presents a challenge for both patient and health-care practitioner. Although the clinical diagnosis of in\u00a3uenza is reported to be correct in 65^85% of cases in the controlled setting of clinical trials, when rigorous case de\u00a2nitions are applied and when in\u00a3uenza has been identi\u00a2ed in the community (reviewed by Cram et al. 1999; Newton et al. 2000) , the accuracy of in\u00a3uenza diagnosis based on symptoms alone may be lower in the more general community. Indeed, several studies have highlighted the di\u00a4culties encountered distinguishing in\u00a3uenza symptoms from those caused by other respiratory pathogens in health practices contributing to in\u00a3uenza surveillance networks, let alone routine health care. For example, recent Australian surveillance data reveal that the clinical suspicion of in\u00a3uenza in general practice is con\u00a2rmed by laboratory isolation of in\u00a3uenza in only 49^54% of cases (Kelly et al. 2000) . Similar studies in England and Wales, France, and Scotland have reported con\u00a2rmation of clinical diagnosis of in\u00a3uenza ranging from 6 to 67% of noti\u00a2ed cases (Joseph 1995; Carrat et al. 1997) .",

Although of bene\u00a2t for disease-surveillance purposes, methods such as cell culture, that require days to weeks to resolve, can provide only retrospective diagnosis in most cases and have no immediate bene\u00a2t for the patient from whom the sample originated. In order to bene\u00a2t the patient and/or healthcare provider, a diagnostic result must be available quickly enough and provide su\u00a4cient information to lead to some action during or immediately after the patient consultation that o\u00a1ers an improvement over the outcome of clinical diagnosis alone. The turn^round time required for the diagnostic result to be useful is in part a function of the environment under which the consultation occurs. For example, for viral respiratory tract infections in the hospital environment semi-rapid (1 day or less) laboratory con\u00a2rmation of clinical diagnoses has been reported to lead to both clinical and \u00a2nancial bene\u00a2ts for patients and health-care providers (Woo et al. 1997; Barenfanger et al. 2000) . Bene\u00a2ts include reductions in mortality, length of stay and hospital costs, and the more appropriate use of antibiotics. Although it is conceivable that such a semirapid test may have bene\u00a2t in general practice, the realities of patient numbers, short consultation time and di\u00a4culties involved in ensuring patient recall for treatment suggest that a much more rapid,`point-of-care' (POC) test is required.",

Typical POC environments include general practitioner and paediatric o\u00a4ces, labour and delivery suites, emergency rooms, walk-in clinics and student health clinics (Hesterberg & Crosby 1996) . In hospital and managed-care environments POC assays have a role wherever rapid con\u00a2rmatory diagnosis is considered bene\u00a2cial and are often referred to as`bedside tests'. In the case of in\u00a3uenza, the probable bene\u00a2ts of rapid tests in such environments are considered to include early institutional outbreak recognition, improved focused diagnosis (particularly in patients with complex medical history), earlier discharge and reduced prescription of inappropriate antibiotics (Newton et al. 2000) .",

The lowest concentration of virus that yielded a result detectable by the operator's eye was considered to be the limit of sensitivity. Sensitivity ranged from 5 \u00c210 2 to 1.2 \u00c210 4 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) units for in\u00a3uenza A and 9.4 \u00c210 2 to 1.4 \u00c210 4 TCID 50 units for in\u00a3uenza B (mean 4.4 \u00c210 3 and 7.4 \u00c210 3 , for A and B, respectively) (table 1).

It seems probable that these discrepancies are caused by di\u00a1erent requirements for isolation of culturable virus and preservation of reactive antigens in a given specimen type. Indeed, the retrospective detection of in\u00a3uenza in several culturenegative and FLU OIA test-positive specimens using other approaches (table 5) supports this hypothesis.

However, it highlights the desirability for a POC diagnostic to accommodate multiple specimen types. Overall it appears that the specimen types yielding the highest FLU OIA sensitivity in clinical practice are aspirates (nasal or tracheal), sputa and nasopharyngeal swabs. Although comparative data were not available in all cases, throat swabs were reported to be the least sensitive sample by several investigators.

This presumably re\u00a3ects the low level of in\u00a3uenza A and B co-circulation during the seasons and locales in which specimens were isolated. The majority of studies appear to have involved specimens principally from in\u00a3uenza A-infected patients. However, two reports have documented FLU OIA performance characteristics using specimens that were predominately in\u00a3uenza B positive (Mitamura et al. 1999; Yamazaki et al. 1999) . In both cases the sensitivity and speci\u00a2city of the FLU OIA test were consistent with the results for in\u00a3uenza A-positive specimens reported by others (table 6) . Data obtained using cultured in\u00a3uenza A and B viruses also indicate that the FLU OIA test is not biased towards either A or B (table 1 and Watanabe et al. (1999) ). In addition, on the basis of the limited cocirculation data available, it appears that the FLU OIA test may have a clinical detection limit for in\u00a3uenza B that is similar to that of in\u00a3uenza A virus (Herrmann et al. 2001) . Taken together, these data indicate that the FLU OIA test has equivalent performance characteristics for in\u00a3uenza A or B virus. The clinical manifestations of in\u00a3uenza and viral shedding patterns are known to di\u00a1er between adults and children (reviewed by Hayden & Palese 1997) . Although the data available to date are limited and further study is warranted, it appears that the FLU OIA test may be ca. 10% more sensitive for paediatric specimens (Mulford et al. 1999; Lynch 2000) .",

A reliable diagnosis of in\u00a3uenza on clinical grounds alone is challenging under most circumstances, and particularly so during the early stages of an outbreak when intervention is likely to be most e\u00a1ective. Since laboratory tests are expensive, require expert sta\u00a1 and provide results that are too late to impact the doctor^patient interaction, there is a role for rapid, sensitive POC tests for in\u00a3uenza A and B to augment clinical impressions. Herein we have reviewed the performance characteristics of one such test, the FLU OIA test. The FLU OIA test is a unique POC test based on silicon chip biosensor-mediated detection of in\u00a3uenza A and B nucleoprotein. The test is broadly reactive with in\u00a3uenza A and B viruses and is used in a wide range of health-care organizations worldwide. It has been found to be compatible with a large number of specimen types, including mucoid specimens such as sputum, which can present problems for`dipstick'-type POC tests relying on chromatographic technology or \u00a3ow-through membrane-based tests.",

For example, throat swabs, which have been found to be a comparatively poor specimen for isolation of in\u00a3uenza virus by culture, are also poor performers in the FLU OIA. The best samples for the FLU OIA test have been found to be nasopharyngeal swabs, aspirates and sputa. Sensitivity of the test using the best specimens from studies which examined multiple specimen types is reported to range from 79 to 100% (mean 91%, table 6). However, it is recognized that \u00a3exibility in the choice of sample type is an important consideration for both health-care workers and patients. The overall high speci-\u00a2city of the FLU OIA test (84 and 94% for all sample types and sample types yielding highest speci\u00a2city, respectively) confers con\u00a2dence in a positive test result even in those circumstances where less than optimal specimens are available. This conclusion is reinforced by the observation that throat swabs are often listed as the specimen type yielding highest speci\u00a2city (table 6) .",

Indeed, a recent report on the use of the FLU OIA test in clinical practice indicated that physicians found routine POC testing to be clinically useful in augmenting clinical impressions (Musgnug & Chapin 2000) . Bene\u00a2ts described included improved patient satisfaction, informed discussion of intervention measures and increased incidence of appropriate therapy. From the institutional perspective, rapid diagnosis of in\u00a3uenza at the outset and during an outbreak provides a useful tool in the timely and informed application of appropriate disease-containment measures. A similar outcome is envisaged for veterinary applications of the FLU OIA test. All of these applications take advantage of the rapid feedback of a diagnostic result to the health-care worker a\u00a1orded by a POC test.",

Although of little immediate bene\u00a2t for the patient su\u00a1ering from in\u00a3uenza, the individuals, institutions and government organizations performing this function play a vital role in in\u00a3uenza management on a community, national and international basis. Rather than supplanting this established network, we contend that the widespread use of POC tests provides an opportunity to extend awareness of in\u00a3uenza in the community and o\u00a1ers the potential for more diverse and cost-e\u00a1ective surveillance. For example, kits such as the FLU OIA test that are appropriate for`\u00a2eld use' may be used to gather data on in\u00a3uenza incidence in remote locations or in communities that lack convenient access to clinical laboratories. In addition, the testing of samples by the FLU OIA test before shipment to the laboratory for tissue culture o\u00a1ers interesting options for increasing the frequency of in\u00a3uenza-positive specimens and reduced laboratory costs.",

In the event of an in\u00a3uenza pandemic it seems probable that demand for diagnostic con\u00a2rmation of suspected cases will become widespread, and in those areas where laboratories are available they are likely to quickly become overloaded. POC tests are expected to prove useful in facilitating increased surveillance through patient screening prior to submission of FLUOIA for improved in\u00a3uenza management S. P. Tucker and others 1921 1999) . In communities that lack access to laboratories, POC testing may be the only option available. Because the simplicity of POC tests such as the FLU OIA test and their self-contained design is consistent with use by nonmedical sta\u00a1, surveillance activities could be extended to include non-traditional sampling sites and personnel. Indeed, it is conceivable that rapid POC tests could become a front-line tool with broad applications for disease management and containment not only in the health-care setting, but also in places such as farms, quarantine centres, military barracks, airports and other locations wherever an on-the-spot diagnosis is required.",
