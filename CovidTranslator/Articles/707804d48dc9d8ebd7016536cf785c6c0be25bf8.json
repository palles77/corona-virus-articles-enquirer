            "text": "It has been more than 30 years since the first incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was discovered in the USA in 1981. At that time, little was known about the disease. There was much stigmatization and discrimination as it was a fatal, infectious disease with a rapidly declining illness trajectory and no known cure. Moreover, HIV mainly affected stigmatized groups such as gay men and intravenous drug users. During the 1990s, significant medical advances ushered in a new era and transformed HIV from a fatal to a manageable chronic disease (Mocroft et al., 1998) . Not only have medical advances enabled people with HIV to have an increased life expectancy, but studies have shown that with the use of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), those with undetectable viral load pose a significantly lower risk of sexual transmission of HIV to others (Bavinton et al., 2014; Cohen et al., 2011) . With transmissibility significantly reduced, they can have sexual relationships, get married, and have HIV-negative children, which are possibilities they may not have had pre-ART (Seeley et al., 2009) . Thus, ART allows people with HIV to regain some semblance of normality with socially normative roles (Persson & Richards, 2008) . Sontag (1989) had earlier predicted that HIV would be treated as another chronic disease once it was better understood and when treatment became available. In the years following the advent of ART, there were attempts to reframe HIV from a health crisis requiring \"exceptional\" intervention strategies to a chronic disease which should be treated \"like any other\" (Moyer & Hardon, 2014) . However, owing to pervasive stigma and discrimination, there is literature which argues against the notion that HIV has been normalized as another disease (Moyer & Hardon, 2014; Persson, 2013) .",

The present health discourse on \"normalization\" is one where people with HIV are encouraged to adhere to their treatment regimen as medication will facilitate the re-establishment of normality (Mattes, 2014) . However, studies have shown that people with HIV only partially incorporated this notion of normality as they are socially embedded in a network of relationships beyond medical interventions, and social contexts are not taken into consideration in the rhetoric of normalization (Beckmann, 2013; Moyer, 2012) . These studies showed that people with HIV preferred to hide their HIV identity as they thought that it impeded their progress towards returning to a \"normal\" life (Beckmann, 2013; Moyer, 2012) . Some researchers also argued that although HIV has features of a chronic disease, it does not meet the goal of regaining normality as medical treatment, which should facilitate people with HIV to \"regain control, create order, reduce dependence on others and to feel 'normal' again\", did not fully materialize (Russell et al., 2007) . A main impediment to normalization is stigma, which has not been significantly reduced in the post-ART era (Lekas, Siegel, & Schrimshaw, 2006) . Research has shown that HIV is more stigmatized than other medical conditions (Fife & Wright, 2000; Mak et al., 2006) . Thus, while the present health discourse promises to fulfil the desire of people with HIV for normalization, their experiences may not live up to this promise (Mattes, 2014) .",

Goffman (1963) defined stigma as a discrediting attribute which is conferred by society on a person who is deemed to be discrepant from normative standards. It is a negative evaluation on groups of people rooted in social relationships and shaped by culture. The concept of stigma is broad and encompasses several dimensions including internalized, anticipated, and enacted stigma (Earnshaw, Smith, Chaudoir, Amico, & Copenhaver, 2013) . While anticipated and enacted stigma involve experiences with others, internalized stigma is a result of self-evaluation based on longheld values and beliefs, and associated with affective health (Earnshaw et al., 2013) . Shame is one of the components measured in internalized stigma and it is posited that people with HIV who feel ashamed of their HIV status may have difficulty developing or maintaining positive perceptions of their HIV status (Earnshaw et al., 2013) . Although shame is associated with poor adjustment to HIV, it is often subsumed under stigma or internalized stigma and seldom studied directly (Bennett, Traub, Mace, Juarascio, & O'Hayer, 2016) .",

            "text": "Shame is an emotion which is experienced through a process of self-reflection and is a result of a perceived failure or violation against standards and rules which is attributed to the self (Lewis, M., 2003; Scheff, 1988) . There are a variety of causes for feelings of shame but the consequence is devaluation of the person's worth in the minds of the self and others (Bedford & Hwang, 2003) . As the self is evaluated negatively, self-concept is affected and identity is, thus, threatened (Bedford & Hwang, 2003) . Shame has been described as an intense emotional pain (Lewis, 2003) . Both shame and guilt are forms of social control (Scheff, 1988) . Some studies showed that guilt targets behaviour and people feel remorse and regret over their actions, while shame is felt towards the self and involves feelings of devaluation and worthlessness (Tangney, Stuewig, & Martinez, 2014) . According to Katz (1999) , shame immobilizes a person from action. Owing to the devaluation caused by shame, it is often a hidden emotion which is not apparent and, thus, not easily studied (Scheff, 1988) . H. B. Lewis (1971) had earlier argued that \"unacknowledged shame\" appears in the guises of other feelings or \"shame markers\", such as awkwardness, low selfesteem, inadequacy, and insecurity. Scheff (2000) suggested that shame is a social emotion and saw it as the basis of human behaviour, where people are motivated to conform to avoid it. This concurs with the study by Bedford and Hwang (2003) , where identity in the Chinese culture is seen in relation to others and shame serves as an effective way to ensure social control and maintain harmony in relationships. Shame is distinguished from guilt and their functions are distinct in Western and Asian cultural perspectives (Bedford & Hwang, 2003) . Bedford and Hwang (2003) linked the concepts of guilt and shame to Confucianist ideas where self is seen in relation with others and differs from the Western concept of an individualistic self. They provided a more nuanced elucidation of the aspects of guilt and shame with reference to the types of transgressions committed. The guilt words are \u5185\u759a (guilt towards others), \u7f6a\u6076\u611f (guilt towards behaviour), and \u72af\u7f6a\u611f (guilt towards action which may be criminal); and the shame words are \u4e1f\u81c9 (embarrassment over behaviour), \u60ed\u6127 (ashamed/embarrassed about behaviour), and \u7f9e\u6127 (ashamed of self) and \u7f9e\u803b (the strongest form of shame). It is noted that the Chinese are more prone to shame than people in Western societies (Sun, 2008) . Proneness to shame is found to be associated with relational mobility or the perception of the possibility of forming new relationships and the cost of ending existing ones. A study by Sznycer et al. (2012) showed that shame proneness is higher and relational mobility is lower in Japan than in the UK and the USA.",

Although Singapore consists of several ethnic groups, 75% of the population is Chinese (Department of Statistics Singapore, 2016) and the Chinese comprise about 78% of all the HIV cases detected in Singapore (MOH, 2016) . In addition, the government has often eschewed the perceived decadent Western values of individualism, hedonism, and self-centredness in favour of the adoption of more \"Asian\" or Confucian values of \"country before community and community before self\" (Velayutham, 2007) . It is hardly surprising that Singapore was found to be the least individualistic and most collectivistic country in a study involving participants from the USA, Hong Kong, and Singapore (Hwang, Francesco, & Kessler, 2003) . Thus, the concept of shame is of particular relevance to this study because of its association with identity as well as the significance of Confucian values accorded to a collectivist society.",

They have all been started on ART and do not have any neuropsychiatric conditions. Phone calls were made to HIV patients who fitted the sampling criteria to explain the study and seek their consent for the interviews. Participants were given financial reimbursement of approximately US$62 for their time and transport costs. The sample size was kept small intentionally as this is a pilot study to gain a preliminary understanding of how heterosexual people with HIV reconstruct their identity with the narrative of HIV as a chronic disease. Having equal numbers from each gender also allows for understanding of gender differences in reconstructing their identity. Hence, the sampling strategy is not one of representativeness but, instead, the small number was chosen to achieve vivid illustrative and illuminating insight. The findings from this study may help in conceptualizing a future study to further understand the process of identity reconstruction.",

They were all of Chinese ethnicity, ranged from 38 to 55 years of age, and had been diagnosed for between 3 and 18 years ( Table I) . The Chinese ethnic group was selected with the intention of examining how an HIV diagnosis affects a person's identity in this shame-based culture (Bedford & Hwang, 2003) and whether reconstruction of identity is achievable. The two male participants were married with children and the two female participants were widowed with children. The male participants were infected by female partners outside their marriage. Their spouses had tested negative for HIV and chose to remain married to them. Both female participants had been infected by their late husbands, who had tested positive for HIV and died shortly after diagnosis. All the participants, except for John, are asymptomatic.

As HIV is still a highly stigmatized disease in many Asian societies, including Singapore (Bishop, Oh, & Swee, 2000; Tan et al., 2013) , data collection was conducted with extreme care and sensitivity. The first author (hereafter Table I referred to as the \"researcher\") was the first social worker assigned to all four participants. This history of providing support for them created a safe environment for the participants to reveal emotionally intense and even contentious areas of their behaviours. Rich insights were gained through the in-depth interviews with these four participants. The participants were at ease with the researcher even though the formal helping relationship had been terminated for at least 1 year at the time of the interviews. Their willingness to reveal could be attributed to the trust built up with the researcher, who had journeyed with each participant during the initial phase of HIV diagnosis, and participants had received emotional and instrumental support at different crisis points, including bereavement (the two widows) and financial hardship. The participants were given a choice of interview venue. All preferred the counselling room of the hospital and declined offers by the researcher to interview them at home. According to them, having a social worker visit their home would bring unwanted attention from other family members or neighbours. The interviews were between 80 and 105 min in length.",

The basic unit of analysis is the individual participant situated within the context of his or her marriage and family (Ragin & Becker, 1992) . The analysis captured the experience of the participants in reconstructing their \"spoiled\" identity after the HIV diagnosis. The data were read, reread, and analysed at two levels: within-case analysis and cross-case analysis. At the first level, the analysis focused on how the participants experienced and interpreted the experience in relation to context; that is, their account of their identity construction as well as whether HIV was a chronic disease in their experience. To increase the trustworthiness of the data analysis, critical reflections and debates between the first author (the researcher), who had a close relationship with the participants, and the second author, who was not involved at all in the data collection and kept a distance from the participants, were intentionally carried out when linking data to propositions to achieve pattern matching and explanation building (Yin, 2013) . A conscious effort was made to avoid domination by the researcher's interpretation. An example of such critical reflection can be observed from how the researcher's original proposition shifted closer to that of the participants' in this interpretive process. The researcher, a veteran healthcare professional, had an ingrained opinion from the mainstream healthcare narrative that HIV is now a chronic disease. This narrative was challenged by the participants' subjective experience of a lack of normality in HIV patients. At the second level of analysis, by comparing the analysis across cases and synthesizing the 2 \u00d7 2 matrix of four participants, three main themes were revealed ( Figure 1 ): (i) an overpowering sense of shame; (ii) constructing a liveable identity; and (iii) keeping shame at bay. These themes will be discussed in detail next.",

This was especially so for Bryan when he thought there was a possibility of losing his job, as his career was very important to him. For the women, their role as caregiver for their children was most important and the need to provide financially for the children was secondary, although it was important after the death of their spouses. Both men and women had carer roles, but for the men, their role as provider was primary, and for the women, their role as caregiver was of greater concern.",

It was a means for him to lead a \"normal\" life and not draw attention to his HIV diagnosis. His meaning for keeping healthy was rooted in his identities and the wish to be \"normal\". The participants learnt that if they took care of their health, they could continue with their existing roles and identities.

The challenge is for those living with the virus to emerge from under the shadow of its dominant narrative and transcend it by reconstructing identities which will enable living to be more manageable and bearable. It seems that even in a Chinese majority society like Singapore, the four participants, who are ethnically Chinese, managed to reconstruct \"liveable\" identities despite the shame of having HIV.",

Studies have shown that HIV is more stigmatized than other chronic diseases such as cancer (Fife & Wright, 2000) and infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tuberculosis (Mak et al., 2006) . The experiences of the participants defied the notion that HIV is a chronic disease like any other. Not only is HIV associated with sexual deviance, it is also a disease which is attributable to the individual's behaviour, perceived to be contagious and a risk to others, incurable, and poorly understood by the community (Alonzo & Reynolds, 1995) , especially so in Asian societies heavily influenced by Confucian values.",

There is a range of terms to denote shame and guilt in Chinese, with some variances in their meaning. In this paper, we have identified a dimension of shame,-\u7f9e\u8fb1 (sense of humiliation), which was repeatedly mentioned by the two female participants. \u7f9e\u8fb1 is made up of two Chinese characters: \u7f9e \"shame\" and \u8fb1 \"disgrace\". When combined, these two words portray a deep sense of humiliation and degradation on the \"self\" inflicted by others. This aspect of shame is not on the list of shame descriptors provided by Bedford and Hwang (2003) . \u7f9e\u8fb1 also denotes a sense of injustice; that is, the humiliation is perceived as not being justifiable. It may explain why this deep shame was experienced only by the female participants who contracted HIV disease from their husbands, because they perceived themselves as innocent (\u65e0\u8f9c). One indicator of \u7f9e\u8fb1 revealed by the female participants was the \"look at us in that abnormal manner\" (\u5f02\u6837\u7684\u773c\u5149) that they experienced from healthcare professionals who were not familiar with HIV patients and people whom they suspect knew about their condition. The specific form of degradation mentioned by the female participants was the unfair image of being perceived as \"promiscuous\", which was a disgrace to their dignity as they claimed to have been faithful and to have had only one sexual partner. This dimension of shame was, however, not mentioned by the male participants. Instead, both John and Bryan felt that they experienced an aspect of guilt because the HIV status could potentially cause themselves, their family and extended families to lose face (\u4e22\u8138 or \u6ca1\u8138). Such nuanced insights into the lived experience of people were accessible largely through indepth interviews by a trusted researcher with whom the participants had a long-term rapport.",
