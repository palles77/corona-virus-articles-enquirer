Thus, diagnosis of the cause of SARS was not required in these clinical definitions. However, to not obtain chest radiographs for a patient suspected as having SARS is not practical, neither is it sensible to label a patient as having suspected SARS in the absence of change on chest radiograph. Therefore, to differentiate suspected SARS from probable SARS on the basis of radiographic changes alone is not logical. Furthermore, any child in Hong Kong who has a cold with fever and cough would be diagnosed as suspected SARS by WHO definition. WHO has now revised their definition of a probable case of SARS to include a suspected case of SARS that is positive for SARS coronavirus.",

Suspected SARS, for instance, is now defined as SARS infection that is serious enough that ribavirin is started. The modification is a practical one and partly avoids overdiagnosis of mild febrile symptoms that are probably not SARS. This modification, however, could lead to underdiagnosis of otherwise mild SARS cases. For example, a teenage girl was identified with symptoms of SARS and chest radiographic changes in accordance with the infection, but no definite history of contact was reported. She was started on ribavirin.",

The classification is not intended for triage of patients because any radiographic abnormality might not be noted at presentation. Virological results might also be available a few days after presentation. When we applied this classification to ten children previously reported, 2 Our classification also helps to guide health-workers on patient's management. Newly admitted patients with persistent fever and pneumonia should be isolated, preferably in a single room, and be eventually classified into one of the four forms of EVP. Patients with EVP [C+, V+], EVP [C+, V-], and EVP [C-, V+] need to be isolated for at least 14 days, whereas those with EVP [C-, V-] could be discharged once their symptoms improve.",

In Hong Kong's public hospitals, healthworkers are unable to provide a room for every patient with suspected or probable SARS. Patients diagnosed with SARS may or may not have the SARS virus(es), but they are at risk of contracting the infection if they are grouped with infected patients. Overdiagnosis also leads to inconvenience in the workplace or at school. The case of a young girl who developed fever during her visit to Taiwan is a good example. She had no SARS contact and chest radiograph was normal. However, the Taiwan government labelled her as a suspected SARS case, and she was transported back to Hong Kong where she was declared free from the infection, but the experience for her was not a memorable one.",

One explanation for this finding could be that in ALLHAT-LLT, almost 50% of the participants were women and a high proportion of patients in the control group used statins. The ASCOT investigators argue that the number of events among women and participants with diabetes was too small, because of the inadequate power of the study.

A higher dose might have shown better results. But there is also a substantial difference in the biochemical structure of the different statins. Lovastatin and pravastatin are natural statins of fungal origin, whereas simvastatin is a semisynthetic derivative of lovastatin. Atorvastatin and fluvastatin are fully synthetic statins. 4 In addition, Cromwell and Ziajka 5 found that the long-term use of atorvastatin led to tachyphylaxis (a decreasing response to a physiologically active agent), which resulted in an increase of LDL cholesterol over time despite optimum treatment. By contrast, all other statins showed no evidence of tachyphylaxis. 5 Atorvastatin offers no additional benefit above antihypertensive treatment for the reduction of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in women, patients with diabetes, and those with left-ventricular hypertrophy or previous vascular disease-and all this without affecting mortality.",
