            "text": "Mice may be maintained as pets because of their size and playful nature. Although playful, mice can be aggressive to cagemates and owners. The aggressive nature often manifests as barbering and/or fi ghting with cagemates and biting their owners. Any potential owner should be educated on the aggressive nature of these small dynamos. Domestic mice (Mus musculus) and the African pygmy mouse (Baiomys spp.) are commonly sold for pets and are available in several varieties. The mice varieties sold in pet stores include white, black, or tan colored, satin hair coat (shiny), pied or spotted, and longhaired 1,2 (Figure 12-1) . The size and ability of mice to escape quickly from the grasp of a human handler make these animals, as pets, better suited for older individuals. The timid nature of mice predispose these animals to biting if handled roughly, which commonly occurs with a young owner. Mice are nocturnal animals and may be a disturbance at night if maintained in a bedroom. Female mice produce less odor than males and therefore may be more desirable as pets. As mentioned earlier, male mice are territorial, and if placed with other male mice, may fi ght. Advantages of having mice as pets include their size, ability to be a good companion animal for the educated (regarding mouse behavior) owner, and adorable appearance.",

Ventilation is essential for small rodent housing to prevent irritation of the respiratory tract from ammonia vapors generated by urine. The recommended housing unit for mice is 12-15\u2033 \u00d7 12-15\u2033 \u00d7 6\u2033 (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height) for each adult mouse; females and young require 2 to 3 times the space listed. 2 The major considerations for selecting an enclosure for mice is that it be resistant to their escape and easy to clean. An open screen top of the enclosure is recommended for proper ventilation. Available rodent cages that fi t this criterion are wire or metal mesh, plastic, and Plexiglas. If the plastic tube housing systems are used, there should be routine cleaning of the sections using hot water and a mild detergent. Owners should be informed of the small distance required for a mouse to escape and their ability to chew through plastic. An owner must always monitor the cage for possible escape avenues, especially if the animal has a predilection for modifying the cage opening through chewing. It is very important to provide cage toys and exercise opportunities for mice. The enclosure should be large enough to house not only food and water containers but also cage toys and an exercise wheel (Figure 12-2 ). Although not a cage toy, a hide box, in some form, should also be included for the psychological well-being of the animal. This hide box can be manufactured or a small cardboard container that has one end cut out. Mice like to hide and also sleep during the day. This piece of cage furniture will enable the mouse to sleep undisturbed during the daylight hours.",

The benefi t of these dietary studies is the availability of commercially produced diets that provide the recommended daily nutritional requirements of the mouse. The problem that most owners face is the multitude of dietary products available for mice and the lack of knowledge regarding which food to buy. Most new mouse owners think that rodents eat seed-based diets. Although mice will happily eat seed, seed-based diets are lacking in a number of the nutritional requirements needed to maintain long-term health. Commercial rodent biscuits or pellets with more than 14% protein are the recommended diets for mice. 2 The commercial rodent biscuits or pellets are the only food mice need to obtain their required nutrients (Figure 12-3) . Again, seed-based diets are not recommended, nor is a signifi cant supplementation of fruits, nuts, vegetables, cheese, or other human foods (e.g., peanut butter). If a treat is to be given, yogurt or dried fruit treats manufactured specifi cally for rodents and/or mice should be provided 2 to 3 times a week. For younger mice, less than 3 weeks old, softer pellets are needed because babies start eating pellets and drinking water at 2 to 3 weeks of age. 2 A sipper bottle, placed on the outside of the cage, is easy to maintain and does not take any space within the enclosure. If the cage is plastic or Plexiglas, modifi cations will be needed to attach the sipper bottle on the outside of the cage. Most sipper bottles come with attachment hardware to attach to wire cages ( Figure  12 -4). Fresh bottled water is recommended for mice, although chlorinated tap water is acceptable. The water should be checked on a daily basis and clean water supplied at least every 2 days, if not every day.",

The animals should be quarantined in conditions similar to those in which they will be permanently maintained. Providing adequate food and water will make for a smooth transition. It is imperative that the owner screen the new animal for diseases and watch for any signs of illness. The most common sign of clinical illness is a rough hair coat.

A small speculum (e.g., modifi ed paper clip) or an otoscope may be used to examine the oral cavity and cheek teeth. Mucous membranes help determine hydration status using capillary refi ll time and moisture. Body condition and abdominal palpation are important information that should be obtained. Lymph nodes and limbs are palpated before checking the nails and plantar surface of each foot. The patient should have a normal posture, be aware of its surroundings, and move properly. Any problems should be noted in the record. Finally, a dermatologic exam considers hair coat quality, alopecia, external parasites, and any skin abnormalities. All abnormal fi ndings are written in the record for case review, differential diagnoses determination, diagnostic testing, and treatment considerations.",

As mentioned previously, an unkempt hair coat may point toward generalized illness or external parasitism. Abrasive lesions or pustules on the skin can be signs of external parasites or infectious dermatitis. If external parasites are a problem, the mouse may be uncontrollably scratching. Hair loss may be associated with barbering, either cagemate or self-induced, or with infection (e.g., ringworm). Although not common, Trichophyton mentagrophytes will cause hair loss in mice, from the face, head, and neck. 4 Mice will commonly present with tumors and abscesses. The entire body of the mouse should be palpated for any evidence of masses. If a mass is identifi ed, a fi ne needle aspirate is recommended for basic diagnostic evaluation. With most fi ne needle aspirate samples, the clinical pathology results are not very rewarding. If a diagnosis cannot be obtained through cytologic examination, a biopsy of the lesion is required, and if possible, an excisional biopsy is the procedure of choice.",

Approximately 0.5 to 0.7 ml/100 g body weight can be safely removed from a nonanemic healthy mouse. 2 The mouse patient should always be anesthetized for blood collection procedures. Usually inducing the animals in a closed chamber and maintaining the patients in a mask will allow the technician plenty of time to collect the blood sample. A small, 25-, 26-, or 30-gauge needle, usually placed on a 1-ml syringe, is recommended for collecting the blood. Recommended blood collection sites in a mouse are a warmed ventral tail vein or the tip of the tail. 2 Box 12-2 describes the technique used for retroorbital bleeding in mice. The retroorbital bleeding technique is commonly used in laboratory animal settings and is easily performed by an experienced veterinarian or veterinary technician. 5 On smaller rodents, the saphenous vein or lateral vein of the tarsus may be used for multiple blood collections without the use of anesthesia. The patient must be properly immobilized in a restraint tube (35-ml syringe) with the leg extended and the skin held tight on the medial aspect of the thigh using the thumb and forefi nger. 2 The taut skin on the lateral aspect of the thigh allows exposure of the saphenous vein. A 23-gauge needle is used to puncture the vein, and blood is collected in a microhematocrit tube as it fl ows from the vessel. 5 Blood samples obtained from nail and ear clips are not considered appropriate diagnostic samples. Cardiac puncture is recommended only in terminal cases and when the animal is maintained under general anesthesia because of possible complications involving the lungs and heart vessels.

Restraint is essential for quality diagnostic images and is even more important when patients weigh as little as 40 g. To obtain adequate restraint and prevent movement of the mouse patient during radiographic evaluation, sedation is required. As with all diagnostic BOX 12-2 Retroorbital Blood Collection for Mice From procedures involving avian and exotic animals, an evaluation of the patient is required to determine its ability to withstand the stress associated with the assessment. If it is determined that the patient cannot withstand sedation, then it should be stabilized until it is deemed healthy enough for diagnostic imaging evaluation. Sedating the mouse using an induction chamber and isofl urane anesthetic, as described for restraint, is necessary to obtain diagnostic fi lms. High-speed, 300-mA machines with fi ne or detail-intensifying screens should be adequate for most small exotic mammal images. With mice, dental x-ray units that can focus at short distances may be advantageous for both isolation of focal anatomy and full body radiographs in extremely small patients. For extreme detail in small exotic mammal medicine, using a traditional radiography unit, the Min R mammography system (Eastman Kodak) with Min R single-intensifying screen cassettes, in conjunction with Min R single-emulsion fi lm, has been recommended. 1 Digital radiography is bringing a new dimension to radiograph evaluations and detail. The secret to success in either traditional or digital radiographic imaging is to restrict patient movement during exposure. Two views, ventrodorsal and lateral, are recommend for mice patients.

Ivermectin and fenbendazole have been used effectively in treating this parasite in mice. 6 Giardia muris is a common protozoal parasite affecting mice. 5 This organism can be seen using a direct fecal examination of an affected patient's fecal material.

Rats are maintained in environments that are similar to those of other small rodents, but rats do not produce the quantities of odiferous urine associated with other rodents. For rats, large wire cages with easy-to-remove plastic bottoms are the optimal enclosure (Figure 12-7) . The recommended housing unit size for rats is 15-20\u2033 \u00d7 15-20\u2033 \u00d7 7-10\u2033 (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height) for each adult rat, with females and young requiring 2 to 3 times the space listed. 2 Rats like to climb ramps and rope for exercise, so a cage that is taller than the listed requirements would be better suited for most singly housed animals. The major considerations for selecting an enclosure for rats, as with mice, are that it is resistant to their escape and easy to clean. An open screen top on the enclosure is recommended for proper ventilation. Available rodent cages that fi t this criterion are wire or metal mesh, plastic, and Plexiglas. If the plastic tube housing systems are used, there should be routine cleaning of the sections using hot water and a mild detergent.

These studies have taken place because of the fact that rats are one of the most commonly used laboratory animals when investigating human disease processes. The benefi t of these dietary studies is the availability of commercially produced diets that provide the recommended daily nutritional requirements of the rat. The problem that most owners face is the multitude of dietary products available for rats, and owners often buy seed-based diets. Like mice, rats will happily eat seed although seed-based diets are lacking in a number of the nutritional requirements needed to maintain long-term health. Commercial rodent biscuits or pellets with 20% to 27% protein are the recommended diets for rats. The commercial rodent biscuits or pellets are the only food rats need to obtain their required nutrients. Again, seed-based diets are not recommended, nor is a signifi cant supplementation of fruits, nuts, vegetables, cheese, or other human foods (e.g., peanut butter). If a treat is to be given, yogurt or dried fruit treats manufactured specifi cally for rodents and/or rats should be provided 2 to 3 times a week (Figure 12-9) . For younger rats, less than 3 weeks old, softer pellets are needed because babies start eating pellets and drinking water at 2 to 3 weeks of age. 2 A sipper bottle, placed on the outside of the cage is easy to maintain and does not take up space within the enclosure. If the cage is plastic or Plexiglas, modifi cations will be needed to attach the sipper bottle on the outside of the cage. Most sipper bottles come with attachment hardware to attach to wire cages. Fresh bottled water is recommended for rats, although chlorinated tap water can also be used. The water should be checked on a daily basis and clean water supplied at least every 2 days, if not every day. ",

Unfortunately, there is no time period that will screen 100% against potential infectious agents, and with rats, time is critical because their life span and repro ductive time frame is so short. Quarantining the introduced animals in conditions similar to those in which they will be maintained permanently, reduction of handling, and providing adequate food and water will make for a smooth transition. It is imperative that the owner screen the new animal for diseases and watch for any signs of illness. All rats that are captive, either as pets or in a breeding setup, should have no access to insects, wild rodents, or other animals. The most common sign of clinical illness is an unkempt hair coat. The lack of grooming is most often related to the animal feeling depressed or sick and thereby not having the energy to perform routine behaviors. If a number of animals are being quarantined, sacrifi cing an apparently diseased animal is the most effi cient way to determine a rapid defi nitive diagnosis.

Dental x-ray units that can focus at short distances may be advantageous for both isolation of focal anatomy and full body radiographs in extremely small patients, including rats. For extreme detail in small exotic mammal medicine, using a traditional radiography unit, the Min R mammography system (Eastman Kodak) with Min R singleintensifying screen cassettes in conjunction with Min R singleemulsion fi lm has been recommended. 1 Digital radiography is bringing a new dimension to radiograph evaluations and detail. The secret to success with either traditional or digital radiographic imaging is to restrict patient movement during exposure. 2 Two views, ventrodorsal and lateral, are recommend for rat patients. If there are rotational problems with the rat patient, a dorsoventral view may provide better imaging quality. 2 The patient should be taped to the cassette or positioning board with white cloth tape or masking tape. Taping the rat to the cassette or positioning board will aid in image consistency with that particular patient and among similar animals.

The most common subcutaneous tumor in rats is the fi broadenoma of the mammary tissue. 4 The mammary tumors can reach very large sizes and affect both males and females. To reduce the incidence of fi broadenomas, ovariohysterectomies are advocated at an early age in female animals. Whereas mammary tumors in mice are almost always malignant, rat mammary tumors are usually localized and respond to surgical resection. 4",

If the position of the incisors is compromised, malocclusion will occur, causing overgrowth of their front teeth. The teeth, if left untrimmed, can cause trauma to the dorsal surface of the oral cavity (upper incisors) and the lower teeth extending outside of the mouth. In severe cases the teeth may adversely affect the animal's ability to eat. The teeth can be trimmed with a high-speed motor tool (e.g., Dremel \u00ae ) with a cutting disk attachment.",

            "text": "A common disease in older male rats is chronic progressive nephrosis; the disease can also affect females. 4 The protein level in the urine commonly exceeds 10 mg/day and progressively increases as the animal ages. 4 The pathophysiology of chronic progressive nephrosis involves glomerulosclerosis with tubulointerstitial disease primarily affecting the convoluted proximal tubule. 4 The progression of the disease process may be slowed through a low-protein diet and anabolic steroid therapy. 4 THERAPEUTICS Fluid therapy can be given to rats through intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intravenous routes. Using a 25-gauge needle, a volume of up to 0.2 ml of fl uid can be injected into the quadriceps muscle. 2 Up to 5 ml of fl uid can be injected under the loose skin covering the neck or lateral body wall. 2 Intraperitoneal fl uids should be administered while the rat is properly restrained to restrict movement. With one of the rat's hindlimbs extended, a 25-gauge needle is inserted into the center of the caudal quadrant of the abdomen, following the line of the extended leg. 2 Up to 5 ml of fl uids can be given via the intraperitoneal route. 2 The most diffi cult method of providing fl uids is intravenously to the lateral tail vein. To access the tail vein, warming the tail to dilate the vessel in warm water for approximately 15 minutes is required to aid in visualization. 2 The older the animal is, the more diffi cult it is to see the vessel through the tail skin.",

As with all animals it is important that a handler always wash his or her hands after interacting with a rat. Salmonella spp. may colonize the intestinal tract of rats. 7 There has been a human case of chorioamnionitis in which Corynebacterium kutscheri has been isolated. 7 This Grampositive bacillus is routinely isolated from the nasopharynx of rats and therefore can be considered a zoonotic agent.Streptobacillus moniliformis and Spirillum minus are organisms that initiate the disease called rat-bite fever. 7 A rat bite is required to seed the bacteria in a human, and after a 6-to 10day incubation cycle, the human begins to show clinical signs associated with the disease (e.g., relapsing fever, chills, vomiting, myalgia, regional lymphadenopathy). 7 Rats appear to be one of the primary rodent carriers of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The rodent develops respiratory disease through which the organism is shed and humans are exposed. Infected humans have respiratory and meningeal disease signs associated with S. pneumoniae illness. 7 It should be mentioned that the rodent fl ea (Xenopsylla cheopis) transmits the plague organism Yersinia pestis. 7 It is wild rodents in which the plague organism is of most concern, but the disease is found worldwide, especially in the American Southwest. This is a very good reason why rats under the care of humans should have no access to wild animals.Leptospira interrogans is transmitted from the infected urine of rats. 7 Again, restricting contact with wild rodents will reduce the risk of pet exposure. Humans infected with L. interrogans have chills and fever and often develop septicemic conditions that can lead to organ dysfunction. 7 Hymenolepis sp. is a cestode found in rats, which can infect humans if contaminated feces are ingested. 7 Giardia sp. is a protozoan parasite, rarely identifi ed in pet rats, that can cause severe gastroenteritis in humans. 7 Because feces have to be ingested for exposure, it is more common for children to become infected with zoonotic intestinal parasites than for adults. Proper sanitary practices after handling rats will help reduce humans' exposure to zoonotic intestinal parasites and other potentially transmissible diseases. All potential rat owners and current rat owners should know that the occurrence of zoonotic disease transmission is extremely rare when commercially bred rats are purchased from reputable pet stores.",
