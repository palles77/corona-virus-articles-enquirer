            "text": "Dimethylamine (DMA) is a highly water soluble gas with many industrial applications. Male F-344 rats were exposed to 175 ppm DMA 6 hr per day for 1,2,4, or 9 days or 2 years. Gross changes in nasal structure were recorded, effects of DMA on the mucociliary apparatus were assessed using video analysis, and tissues were evaluated for histopathology. In vitro nasal mucociliary flow patterns, mucus flow rates, and ciliary activity were studied and recorded for video motion analysis. There were distinct and generally consistent differences in the shape of the naso-, maxillo-, and ethmoid turbinates between young and old animals. Acute and chronic DMA exposures resulted in erosion of the anterior margins of the naso-and maxilloturbinates and fenestration of the adjacent septum. Ciliastasis and mucostasis were observed only on the anteromedial aspect of the maxilloturbinate. In the chronically exposed rats, mucociliary activity was present in areas adjacent to erosions of the turbinates and septum. Abnormal mucus flow patterns, including altered or reversed direction of flow and \"whirlpool-like\" formation, were observed in all treated rats, but were more severe following chronic exposure. There was a good correlation between the distribution of responses as assessed by histopathology and abnormal mucociliary function at all time points. In conclusion, the mucociliary apparatus continues to function in the nasal passages of rats having localized destruction of nasal epithelium, induced by DMA exposure, and this clearance system responds to alterations of nasal structure by modification of mucus flow patterns. 0 1987 Academic Fw.s.

Postmortem assessment of mucociliary function was found to provide a more sensitive indicator of toxicity than histopathology in rats exposed to another gaseous irritant, formaldehyde . This concept has been investigated primarily in relatively young animals and following relatively short exposure periods (up to 10 days). Information on mucociliary function in the rat as it ages and responses to life-time exposure to irritants is lacking in the literature. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of DMA on the nasal mucociliary apparatus of the F-344 rat following acute and chronic exposure. In addition to this, the normal mucociliary apparatus of the F-344 rat at 2 years of age was examined for the first time. Changes in nasal structure that were discovered during the course of the study and thought to be associated with aging or with DMA exposure were also examined. Histopathology of DMA-induced lesions detected in the nasal mucosa which had not been reported previously are also described.",

The 2 year animals were part of a CIIT sponsored bioassay (Buckley et al., 1984) . Six animals were examined at each concentration. Two groups of control animals were used in this study, 12 acute control animals (6 weeks old) and 6 chronic control animals (2 years old) derived from the DMA bioassay. The terminal body weights ofthe animals were 241.67 2 4.99,238.17 + 4.29, 225.33 f 1.84, 221.08 f 3.17, and 346.50 f 9.82 for animals exposed for 1, 2,4, or 9 days or 2 years, respectively, and 228.25 + 4.20 and 355.83 f 11.92 for the acute and chronic control groups (values are expressed as means in grams +-SE). Animals for the acute study were housed in polycarbonate cages on wire racks, over heat-treated hardwood bedding. They were transferred to stainless steel exposure cages which were placed on top of the stainless steel cage racks in the exposure chambers during the exposure periods. Chronic study animals were housed individually in hanging stainless steel wire-mesh cages in the exposure chambers. Pretesting of the chamber for concentration calibration indicated that the concentration of DMA was stable and was found to be within 10% of the nominal concentration at all points within the chamber (W. H. Steinhagen, personal communication) . During periods of nonexposure, the animals were provided with food (NIH-07 open formula diet, Ziegler Brothers, Gardners, PA) analyzed for selected contaminants (Lancaster Labs, Lancaster, PA) and tap water ad libitum. The chambers housing the animals were maintained on a 12hour light/dark cycle. All animals used in the acute phase of this study had negative viral titers in a standard murine virus antibody determination (Microbiological Associates Inc.). Sera from selected animals in the chronic study chambers (none were from animals used in this study) were negative with the exception of a few (3/ 12 controls, l/ 12 175 ppm DMA) positive results for rat corona virus.",

In (10 week) rat nasal cavity following exposure to 175 ppm DMA for 1 or 9 days. The arrows indicate the direction of mucus flow. Note the rotational flow over the posterior lateral wall (asterisk). The solid arrow indicates a region in which mucus flowed from the naso-to the maxilloturbinate over areas of ciliastasis following 9 days of exposure. some animals exposed for 9 days, mucus was seen to flow across adhesions of the nasoturbinate to the maxilloturbinate, thus bypassing obstruction to normal flow direction presented by fenestration of the ventral margin of the nasoturbinate (Fig. 4) . Mean mucus flow rates in the nasopharynx and on the posterior naso-and maxilloturbinates were increased slightly in treated animals compared to controls (Table 1 , areas 9, 10, and 5), but this increase was not statistically significant. In the anterior nasal passages, mean mucus flow rates in DMA-treated rats were decreased compared to controls in several areas. However, the only region of the nose in which mean mucus flow rate was significantly decreased in treated rats was in area 1, a site closely adjacent to DMA-induced fenestrations on the anterior nasoturbinates. DMA-exposed animals: chronic study. Animals exposed chronically to DMA exhibited the same anatomical and functional changes described for chronic control animals (see above). Treatment-induced destruction of nasal tissues included loss of the anterior third of the nasoturbinate and the anterodor-mucus flow patterns were found in association with these areas of tissue destruction, as tissue loss prevented normal flow in these areas, with mucus bypassing affected regions (Fig. 5) . Other alterations of mucus flow patterns included reversal of flow on the lateral wall in the region posterior to the dorsal margin of the maxilloturbinate (Fig. 5) , and in the affected areas the direction of ciliary beat was also modified to the direction of mucus flow. In one animal, the naso-and maxilloturbinates were fused and a thick mucus stream was seen to flow from one turbinate to the other across the point of fusion. Mucus flow rates were generally increased over those of chronic control animals (Table 1 ). In four out of six animals in the chronic study mucociliary activity resembling that in areas lined by respiratory epithelium was observed as a posterior extension of ciliated epithelium into regions normally lined by olfactory epithelium. This was seen during the visual examination (Fig. 5) and was presumed to represent respiratory metaplasia (see histopathology below). Histopathology",

The vacuolation involved both globose and mature olfactory sensory cells, while sustentacular cells were apparently less affected (Figs. 8a and 8b). Following 4 or 9 days exposure there was fairly extensive loss of olfactory sensory cells, but this lesion was again confined to the dorsal meatus. Bowman's glands were unaffected, but in areas of severe sensory cell damage there was some loss of olfactory nerve bundles. DMA-exposed animals: chronic study. Lesions in rats exposed to DMA for 2 years were very similar to those reported previously for rats exposed for 6 months (Buckley et al., 1985) . Only those changes which involve the mucociliary apparatus will be described. Again there was good correlation between the results of functional studies and histopathology. Lesions were most severe in the anterior regions of the nose and comprised focal or regional squamous metaplasia, with the normal respiratory epithelium (Fig. 9a ) being replaced by a stratified squamous epithelium (Fig. 9b) . This response was associated with chronic active inflammation and occurred in regions with complete loss of mucociliary function. More posteriorly, the only consistent response to exposure was moderate to severe goblet cell hyperplasia, which was most prominent on the posterior lateral wall, a region which exhibited reversal of mucus flow. Respiratory metaplasia seen in four out of six animals in the mucociliary function study was characterized by posterior extension of ciliated respiratory epithelium into regions normally lined by olfactory epithelium.

However, during the course of the study some of the changes seen in the noses of 2-year-old control and chronically treated rats were considered to be age related. These changes included anatomical differences between young and old rats and darkening of olfactory pigments in older animals. These observations will be discussed first, to aid in interpretation of the DMA-induced effects. Age-related darkening of the pigmentation of the olfactory mucosa has been reported previously in Sprague-Dawley rats (Hinds and McNelley, 198 1) . Considering the variability of coloration of olfactory epithelium both within and between species, Jackson (1960) concluded that age-related alteration of olfactory epithelial pigmentation is of no functional significance in rats and may be attributable to auto-oxidation of phospholipids in the olfactory epithelium. However, in humans there is a gradual loss of olfactory sensitivity with increasing age (Corso, 197 1) . Despite the evidence from a wide variety of approaches ACUTE AND CHRONIC NASAL TOXICITY OF DMA found in the literature, it appears that little conclusive evidence is available on most of the constituents of the olfactory pigment complex (Moulton, 197 1) . The present study does not address the functional significance of olfactory pigment, but rather provides another observation point for others who may be researching this complex system. We could find no previous report of agerelated anatomical changes in the rodent nasal passages. In the present study there were clear differences between young rats used for acute studies and old rats available from the chronic bioassay, despite the similar genetic backgrounds of the two groups of animals. It was hypothesized that these changes could be due to housing conditions because the chronic study animals were maintained in stainless steel cage racks and were deprived of food each day for the 6 hr of chamber exposure (0 ppm). Recent observations by our group on the nasal anatomy of old F-344 rats that have been housed on bedding and allowed food and water ad libitum revealed anatomical features similar to those reported in the aging rats in the present study. This observation indicates that anatomical changes in the nose of the rat are probably not attributable to chamber housing or 6 hr per day of food deprivation.",

Morphometric information on 2-yearold rats, however, is also not available and was not an aim of this study. The complex structure of the nasal passages, by increasing nasal surface area, plays an important role in nasal functions of humidification, warming, and cleaning of inspired air (Negus, 1958) . Furthermore, airflow patterns in the nose probably play a major role in determination of regional exposure levels to inhaled noxious materials, including particulate matter (Torjussen, 1983 ) and irritant gases (Buckley et al., 1984) . The anatomy of the airway has been shown to significantly influence airflow velocity, local turbulance, and residence times for air in casts of the human and baboon nasal cavities (Girardin ef al., 1983; Patra et al., 1986) . Further work by and Aharonson et al. ( 1974) also demonstrated that inspiratory flow rates can affect nasal deposition of vapors in rats and dogs. Changes in these parameters as a result of the aging process could cause age to have an effect on regional dosimetry in the nose and should be kept in mind when studying mechanisms of nasal responses to inhaled materials.",

Water soluble gases and vapors such as hydrogen fluoride, ammonia, iodine, and formaldehyde are effectively trapped and retained by the moist regions of the upper respiratory tract (Pattle, 196 1; Dalhamn and Sjoholm, 1963; Egle, 1972; Morris and Smith, 1982) . However, absorption of gases in the upper respiratory tract is influenced by many factors including water solubility, reactivity, and saturation of metabolic pathways and is discussed extensively by Stott et al. ( 1986) and . The distribution of lesions found in this study indicates that there is possibly a high rate of deposition of DMA in the anterior nasal passage. Mc-Nulty and Heck ( 1983) showed that following acute exposure, DMA is readily absorbed and retained in highest concentration in the respiratory mucosa, the mucosal type which lines much of the anterior nasal airways. Mc-Nulty and Heck ( 1983) concluded that DMA toxicity is primarily attributable to the irritant properties of the parent compound with a possible role for the metabolites of DMA such as formaldehyde . The direct cytolethal effects of DMA causing frank tissue damage are most likely due to the one or both of these mechanisms; however the mechanisms responsible for the many changes seen in the present study remain to be determined. It is of interest that despite severe tissue destruction in the anterior nose following a single 6-hr exposure, the nasal lesions exhibited very little evidence of progression, even after 2 years of exposure. These findings indicate a possible regional susceptibility to DMA toxicity or a degree of adaptation by the rat to continued DMA exposure. Postmortem examination of mucociliary function has been used to a very limited extent in the nose. This approach has a number of evident disadvantages because of its invasive nature . However, a similar technique was employed to advantage for the assessment of responses to cigarette smoke in the lower respiratory tract of rodents (Iravani and Melville, 1974) . Furthermore, visual assessment of mucociliary function using this procedure has been found to be a more sensitive indicator of formaldehyde toxicity than histopathology in rats ).",

            "text": "In the present study a number of observations of interest were found which could not have been detected using any available in vivo techniques. Effects of DMA on nasal mucociliary function were apparent after a single 6-hr exposure and they exhibited minimal progression throughout the acute study, unlike responses to formaldehyde which have also been studied using this experimental approach . DMA-induced effects included almost complete reversal of mucus flow and ciliary beat in one region of the lateral wall and clear modification of flow patterns to provide clearance around areas of turbinate and septal destruction. These types of effects have been seen in the tracheobronchial tree of rats following exposure to cigarette smoke (Iravani, 1972) and in cases of chronic bronchitis (Iravani and van As, 1972) . In both of the latter studies clearance from the tracheobronchial tree was considered to be impaired. However, we could find no literature on these types of effects in the nasal passages of any species. Altered flow patterns that direct mucus away from areas of ciliastasis raise questions about the mechanisms that control the direction of ciliary beating and mucus flow in the nose, about which little is known. Mucus pooling, seen between and over the turbinates of DMAtreated rats, indicates that while the mucociliary apparatus can respond to damage by altering mucus flow patterns, it may not function optimally under these conditions. Pooling of mucus was also seen in chronic control animals, indicating a possible compromise in the efficiency of the mucociliary apparatus with age. DMA-induced alteration of mucus flow patterns and ciliary beat direction may provide a useful tool for studies of factors which control this complex clearance system in the nose. Buckley et al. (1985) described responses induced in the nasal passages of rats and mice by inhalation exposure for 6 or 12 months to several concentrations of DMA, including 175 ppm. The present study confirmed the previously reported respiratory metaplasia seen in the olfactory region of the nose following chronic exposure of rats to DMA (Buckley et al., 1985) . Furthermore, the present study has demonstrated that areas which exhibit histologic evidence of respiratory metaplasia display the ciliary activity and mucus flow characteristics associated with areas normally lined by respiratory epithelium. Metaplasia of the alveolar lining of the lung of laboratory animals, from a nonciliated to a ciliated cuboidal or columnar epithelium, has been induced by a number of air pollutants, including synthetic smog (Nettesheim and Szakal, 1972) . It is interesting that metaplasia to a respiratory-type epithelium occurs at both extremities of the respiratory tract. However, it remains to be determined whether these responses are protective in nature or whether similar mechanisms are responsible for these changes in the nose and lung.",

Presumably, despite continued exposure, there was considerable repair in the regions lined by squamous epithelium and resolution of the vacuolation seen in the respiratory and olfactory epithelia, following chronic exposure. In the respiratory epithelial-lined regions of the anterior nasal cavity, acute epithelial degeneration led to squamous metaplasia in chronically exposed animals in both the present study and the study reported by Buckley et al.

This change was very severe in affected areas and was seen in both ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells and ducts of underlying glands of the respiratory mucosa, while in the olfactory epithelium this change was largely confined to sensory cells. Buckley et al. (1985) reported vacuolation of olfactory epithelium, which has subsequently been interpreted to involve the ducts of Bowman's glands (K. T. Morgan, unpublished observations) . This vacuolation differs significantly from that induced by acute DMA exposure. Epithelial vacuolation is a common artifact in many tissues (Thompson and Luna, 1978) . However, epithelial vacuolation was not seen in control animals in the present study, and similar changes have not been seen in many other studies of nasal toxicity carried out in this laboratory using similar or identical histologic procedures, suggesting that it was a response to DMA exposure. It has been proposed that toxic responses to DMA may be attributable to the metabolism of this compound to formaldehyde . However, acute formaldehyde toxicity in rats was not found to induce epithelial vacuolation or the severe subepithelial destructive changes seen with DMA in the present study suggesting that an alternative mechanism may be responsible for DMA toxicity. Further studies of DMA-induced epithelial vacuolation may provide further insight into the mechanism of action of this chemical in the nose of the rat.",
