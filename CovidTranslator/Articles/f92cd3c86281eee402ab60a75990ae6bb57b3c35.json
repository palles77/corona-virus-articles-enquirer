Nucleic acid amplification assays are the method most widely used to provide laboratory confirmation of MERS [1] . MERS cases are routinely confirmed based on the detection of unique MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA sequences by real-time reverse-transcription (rRT)-PCR, with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary [2] . The WHO recently published updated interim recommendations for MERS-CoV laboratory testing and recommends an rRT-PCR assay targeting the envelope (upE) gene for screening, followed by confirmation with an assay for the re-gions encoding either the open reading frame (ORF)1a, ORF1b, or the nucleocapsid protein (N). For sequencing, two target sites on the MERS-CoV genome, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes, are suggested [2] [3] [4] .",

The primers and probes were used according to the previous study [3] . All rRT-PCR reactions were performed by using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 \u03bcL (15 \u03bcL PCR reaction mixture and 5 \u03bcL template RNA). Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95\u00b0C and 60 sec at 60\u00b0C. Viral template-positive controls and no-template controls were included in each run. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was amplified simultaneously as a heterologous endogenous internal control to monitor PCR inhibition and specimen quality. A positive test result was defined as a well-defined exponential fluorescence curve that crossed the threshold \u2264 37 cycles, \u2264 38 cycles, and \u2264 35 cycles for the upE, ORF1a, and GAPDH genes, respectively. Nested RT-PCR and sequencing targeting the RdRp and N genes were performed for confirmation, according to the previous protocols [4] . Briefly, the first round of RT-PCR for the two genes was performed by using the primer sets described in the previous report. A second round was conducted if no product was visible by agarose gel electrophoresis after the first round [4] . PCR products were sequenced by using a 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems).",

Monitoring specimen quality is important because assay performance for detection of MERS-CoV is dependent on specimen quality [14] .",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, the PowerChek MERS assay was validated with only upper and lower respiratory specimens. Furthermore, the 50 clinical specimens from MERS-confirmed patients were all sputum specimens. Although lower respiratory specimens are the preferred specimen type for initial MERS diagnosis because of their higher MERS-CoV load, rRT-PCR testing using other specimen types, including serum, urine, and stool specimens, is required in MERS-confirmed cases [2, 16, 17] . Thus, further study to evaluate performance using other specimen types is needed. Second, we did not compare assay performance across different real-time PCR platforms. The PowerChek MERS assay was developed to allow flexibility in the choice of real-time PCR platforms, and can be used with the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System, CFX96 realtime PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), LightCycler 480 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), Rotor-gene Q (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), or Mx3005P thermocycler (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA); however, we evaluated the performance using only the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system. In conclusion, the PowerChek MERS assay has good diagnostic performance for detecting MERS-CoV RNA. This straightforward and accurate assay is a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of MERS and could be especially important in control of a MERS outbreak.",
