TGEV is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes highly fatal acute diarrhoea in newborn pigs. An oral Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) vaccine against anti-transmissible gastroenteritis virus developed in our laboratory was used to study mucosal immune responses. In this L. casei vaccine, repetitive peptides expressed by L. casei (specifically the MDP and tuftsin fusion protein (MT)) were repeated 20 times and the D antigenic site of the TGEV spike (S) protein was repeated 6 times. Immunization with recombinant Lactobacillus is crucial for investigations of the effect of immunization, such as the first immunization time and dose. The first immunization is more important than the last immunization in the series. The recombinant Lactobacillus elicited specific systemic and mucosal immune responses. Recombinant L. casei had a strong potentiating effect on the cellular immunity induced by the oral L. casei vaccine. However, during TGEV infection, the systemic and local immune responses switched from Th1 to Th2-based immune responses. The systemic humoral immune response was stronger than the cellular immune response after TGEV infection. We found that the recombinant Lactobacillus stimulated IL-17 expression in both the systemic and mucosal immune responses against TGEV infection. Furthermore, the Lactobacillus vaccine stimulated an anti-TGEV infection Th17 pathway. The histopathological examination showed tremendous potential for recombinant Lactobacillus to enable rapid and effective treatment for TGEV with an intestinal tropism in piglets. The TGEV immune protection was primarily dependent on mucosal immunity.",

            "text": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a group of Gram-positive bacteria that includes species of Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Streptococcus. Consumed for centuries, LAB has enjoyed a long and safe association with humans and animals for healthy food. Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in the use of LAB as mucosal delivery vehicles. The application of LAB stems from research into effective strategies to deliver vaccine antigens, which may come into contact with the mucosal tissues for the first time, such as the intranasal, oral and genital mucosal surfaces (Lavelle and O'Hagan 2006; Malik et al. 2007 ). Mucosal delivery of therapeutics or vaccines for chronic diseases and infections of mucosal origin could increase their potency and specificity. Because the mucosal immune system builds an effective IgA barrier in no more than 3 days, contact with the mucosal tissues will neutralize the pathogenic microorganism outside of the host. There are abundant studies in the field of LAB vaccines. One major advantage of the use of LAB as a delivery vehicle for vaccines is that the bacteria can elicit both antigen-specific secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A and an effective systemic immune response. The specific IgAs have the same function as the neutralizing IgGs. Some candidate LAB vaccines elicited antigen-specific IgA responses in faeces, saliva or bronchoalveolar and intestinal lavage fluids (Wells and Mercenier 2008) . Additionally, lactobacilli are probiotics that may confer health benefits to the host (Bengmark and Gil 2006; Corthesy et al. 2007; Isolauri et al. 2002; Saarela et al. 2000) , and there is accumulating evidence that lactobacilli are effective at preventing intestinal disease in both humans and animals due to their ability to inhibit pathogen adhesion to the intestinal wall and prevent inflammatory processes (Blum and Schiffrin 2003; de Vrese and Marteau 2007; Ouwehand 2007; Sartor 2005; Sheil et al. 2007 ). Because the porcine digestive tract is similar to the digestive tract of human infants with respect to anatomical and histological features and digestive physiology (Kararli 1995; Oswald et al. 2003; Tadros et al. 2003) , the pig has been used as an animal model to study gastrointestinal diseases of human infants (Gunzer et al. 2002) and vaccination studies against these diseases.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a large family of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that infect a broad range of animal hosts as well as humans. Well-known representatives are porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory CoV, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, canine CoV, feline CoV, bovine CoV, human CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated CoV, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), avian CoV infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey CoV (TCoV). The most famous and critical coronavirus is the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus found in Africa and Asia (Siddell et al. 1983 ). This study investigates whether mucosal immunization is effective in stimulating a protective immune response against CoV infection. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), which is a member of the genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, and order Nidovirales, is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes highly fatal acute diarrhoea in newborn pigs (Cavanagh 1997) . The viral RNA consists of a single strand comprised of three major structural proteins: a phosphorylated nucleoprotein (N protein) and two glycoproteins (the membrane (M) and the spike (S) proteins) (Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler 2006). The S protein has four sites (A, B, C and D). Both the A and D sites were demonstrated to induce TGEV-neutralizing antibodies (Di-Qiu et al. 2011) ; however, the A site is highly glycosylated and thus is not suitable for expression in the LAB prokaryotic expression vector. Additionally, the different TGEV sites induce different immune responses. Following infection with virulent transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, isolated mesenteric lymph node CD4+ T cells mounted a specific proliferative response against infectious or inactivated purified virus upon secondary in vitro stimulation (Anton et al. 1996) . The peptide N321 defines a functional T helper epitope that elicits T cells capable of collaborating with B cells specific for different TGEV proteins (Anton et al. 1995) . The most important finding is that oral immunization with a recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine and infection with TGEV elicit various immune responses, such as humoral immunity and cellular immunity. Here, an oral Lactobacillus casei vaccine against anti-transmissible gastroenteritis virus developed in our laboratory was used to study the mucosal immune response (Jiang et al. 2014) . In this L. casei vaccine, repetitive peptides expressed by L. casei (specifically the MDP and tuftsin fusion protein (MT)) are repeated 20 times and the D antigenic site of the TGEV spike (S) protein is repeated six times.",

Probiotic feed supplementation may benefit the animal host directly by preventing infection and combating the causative agent of the intestinal disorder by balancing the disrupted equilibrium of the enteric flora and augmenting the host's immune responses. However, LAB vaccine has not received national law or certification for human or animal use against coronaviruses. The first clinical trial to use recombinant LAB demonstrated that the containment strategy for L. lactis expressing recombinant IL-10 was effective against Crohn's disease (Braat et al. 2006) . Our laboratory has researched the LAB vaccine for more than one decade, and we have developed many LAB vaccines in the field of piglet diarrhoea (Di-Qiu et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2011; Qiao et al. 2009; Yigang and Yijing 2008) . This study is the last step to obtain new drug certification in China. This Lactobacillus vaccine has been demonstrated to increase the Treg population in the mouse model (Jiang et al. 2014) . Tregs effectively depressed T and B cell proliferation, and some studies demonstrated that this regulation also depressed proliferation in inflammatory bowel disease. Our study investigated whether the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine gradually increased the Breg and Treg populations during the immunization process at the first step of immunization (unpublished data). The intestinal immune system of the pig maintains its ability to mount an active immune response against pathogens and exhibits tolerance to at least food antigens and probably commensal flora through an extremely complex network of cellular and humoral immune interactions. Consequently, it is important to elucidate the immunological inductive sites of the protective mucosal immune response following oral immunization in pigs.",

MDP and tuftsin possess substantial immunopotentiating properties and can induce cellular-mediated immune responses upon oral administration in mice. However, their use in oral vaccines against TGEV challenge in the pig host may have different results. Furthermore, the only host (and target of the vaccine) of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus is the weaning piglet. There have been no clear reports concerning whether TGEV infection stimulates Th1 or Th2type immune response. The relationship between humoral and cellular immune responses is not clear; moreover, whether the systemic or mucosal lymphoid response will be the primary immune response following oral immunization is unknown. At present, we are not certain which pathway the Lactobacillus vaccine will provoke against TGEV infection. Our study is the first to analyse immunity in response to oral immunization and TGEV infection.",

            "text": "Probiotics are well known to have additive effects on human health in terms of improving the gut microflora and modulating immune responses (Villena et al. 2006) . Studies have also reported that probiotic feeding results in an increased spleen mass, followed by higher levels of total serum proteins, increased globulin levels and enhanced production of secretory IgA (Dock et al. 2004) . In humans, lactobacilli colonize the distal small bowel and the large intestine. Different probiotic bacteria possess various mechanisms, including adhesins and/ or coaggregation factors, which aid in adhesion and colonization (Friedrich 2013) . During this period, immunization with recombinant Lactobacillus is crucially important on the effects of immunization, such as the timing of the first immunization in the protocol and the dose. From these results, we show that the immune response in response to the first priming immunization dose is better than the response to the second immunization because the priming dose is better at initiating adhesion and colonization in the piglet. Interestingly, the mucins are large glycoproteins that are the major organic components of mucus. The mucin protein content of the mucus is 20 %, whereas the carbohydrates comprise 70 to 80 % by weight. Intestinal mucin has been shown to inhibit the replication of rotavirus in vitro (Chen et al. 1993; Superti et al. 1993 ). Additionally, a high dose of Lactobacillus adversely affects the immunization. There is some evidence of diarrhoea after a double dose of the Lactobacillus vaccine, but from this result, we find that the two-dose immunization is still the best immunization plan. The reason for the diarrhoea after immunization is the overdose of Lactobacillus, which is a type of microbe that causes a disturbance in the intestinal microbial flora for short time. Many enteric pathogens must first adhere to the intestinal epithelial cells to initiate intestinal disease. Limiting access of the pathogens to intestinal epithelial cells is one strategy to prevent disease that has been investigated previously. For example, the competitive inhibition of bacterial adherence by mimicry of receptors on the apical surface of enterocytes using oral administration of sialylated glycoproteins has been shown to protect newborn calves from the enterotoxigenic E. coli strain K99 (Mouricout et al. 1990 ).",

Furthermore, we showed that the diarrhoea state of piglets administered L. casei was significantly lower than that of piglets administered saline. In the murine model of IFV infection, the virus moves from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory tract (Hori et al. 2001) . HRV-vaccinated and Lactobacillus acidophilus-fed pigs had a significantly higher magnitude of HRV-specific IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cell responses in the ileum and serum IgG antibody and virus neutralizing antibody titres compared to HRV-vaccinated pigs without L. acidophilus colonization (Zhang et al. 2008) . Our immunization stimulated the same systemic specific IgG titres. The specific antibody response neutralized the challenged TGEV, and the load of TGEV in the diarrhoea was significantly decreased. The mucosal immune response formed the first barrier function to neutralize TGEV. In large scale swine farm surveillance, lower piglet birth weight and higher within-litter variability in birth weight were factors associated with higher losses from birth to weaning (Yuan et al. 2015) . During TGEV infection, it is likely that the stronger piglets obtained more IgA than their non-immunized counterparts and thus were more likely to survive until the intestinal villi regenerated and immunity developed. During the histopathological analysis, some damage was observed in the small intestine. For instance, the villus wall of the control groups was thin and almost transparent, probably due to atrophy. Lymphocyte proliferation in the intestinal lamina propria was also found in some piglets administered an oral dose of recombinant Lactobacillus, indicating that recombinant Lactobacillus induced a mucosal immune responses in the piglets. Taken together, our data show the tremendous potential for recombinant Lactobacillus to enable rapid and effective treatment for TGEV infection with intestinal tropism in piglets.",

IFN-\u03b3 induction by TGEV results from interactions between an outer membrane domain of El and the PBMC membrane (Charley and Laude 1988) ; however, these authors did not study the expression of IL-4 by PBMCs. The expression of IFN-\u03b3 was higher than IL-4 in the immunized group, and the Th1/Th2 balance was broken in our study. After immunization with recombinant Lactobacillus, IFN-\u03b3 played a major role in the mucosal immune response. However, after TGEV infection, the systemic and local immune responses shifted from Th1 to Th2. The systemic humoral immune response was stronger than the cellular immune response after TGEV infection. This is the first study to demonstrate that TGEV infection polarized the immune response to Th2 immunity and that recombinant Lactobacillus could weaken TGEV infection in the form of Th2 immunity. From these results, we found that the immunization did not polarize Th2 immunity more seriously compared to the PBS control group. The proteinbased SARS coronavirus vaccine boost induced similar levels of Th1 and neutralizing antibody responses that protected vaccinated mice from subsequent SARS-CoV challenges but induced stronger Th2 and CTL responses (Zheng et al. 2008) . The UV-inactivated SARS coronavirus vaccine retained its immunogenicity and promoted Th2type immune responses (Tsunetsugu-Yokota et al. 2007 ). The activation of Th2 responses such as IL-10 stimulate B cell proliferation, which can produce specific and nonspecific anti-infection antibodies (Grodeland et al. 2015) ; similarly, both T and B cells have functions following Lactobacillus vaccination. The production of IL-9 by Th2 cells results in the proliferation of mast cell growth, and IL-13 stimulates epithelial cell growth (Tukler Henriksson et al. 2015) . The proliferation of epithelial cells is crucial for TGEV infection. The Th2 response could also stimulate the production of mucus by epithelial cells (Zhang et al. 2015) .",

However, the Th1/Th2 balance in the negative control group was different than the balance in the immunized group. TGEV affects both systemic and local cellular immunity without immunization. IL17 has been reported to have both pro-and anti-inflammatory effects (Lafdil et al. 2009; Nagata et al. 2008) . Our results showed that the immunized piglets provoked IL-17 expression form both the systematic and mucosal immune responses after TGEV infection. Compared with the mucosal immune response, IL-17 expression in the mesenteric lymph nodes was markedly lower than the expression in the spleen cells. However, IL-17 expression in the PBS group was lower than the expression level in the immunized groups, indicating that the Lactobacillus vaccine group activated IL-17 expression during TGEV infection. Swine-origin influenza A virus-infected patients exhibited rapid lymphopenia, T cell activation and a preferential loss of the Th17 subset during the early stage of acute infection (Jiang et al. 2010) , which was consistent with the first reports that swine-origin virus inhibited Th17 proliferation after infection. Our study also found the same phenomenon after coronavirus infection in swine compared with the immunized group. The most important finding was that the oral recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine stimulated Th17 cell proliferation. The proliferation was involved in cytokine and chemokine production, neutrophil recruitment, promotion of T cell priming and antibody production (Dirisala et al. 2013) . Th17 responses are protective against lethal influenza virus infection in IL-10deficient mice (McKinstry et al. 2009 ). In contrast, a deleterious role of IL-17 has been proposed to contribute to the acute lung injury associated with IL-17-mediated neutrophil recruitment during influenza virus infection (Crowe et al. 2009 ). There were significant changes in the IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 expression levels in the mesenteric lymph node cells compared with the PBS group. Moreover, IL-4 expression was higher than IFN-\u03b3 expression in the spleen cells. The expression of IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 indicated that the recombinant Lactobacillus effectively inhibited inflammation after TGEV infection.",

            "text": "In this study, we also evaluated TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-9 expression in piglets immunized with recombinant L. casei and then challenged with TGEV. Previously, TLR expression in pigs has been studied only at the mRNA level in lymphocytes using real-time PCR because antibodies against porcine TLRs are not currently available. TGEV infection did not induce TLR-2, TLR-4 and TLR-9 expression in the spleen cells. However, TLR expression was significantly different in the mesenteric lymph node cells compared with the PBS and Lactobacillus vaccine groups. TLR expression was extremely high in the PBS group compared with the other groups. The cytokine and TLR expression levels in the splenic lymphocytes are indicators of systemic immunity, whereas the expression in the mesenteric lymph node cells was associated with the local and mucosal immune responses. The expression levels of all TLRs in mesenteric lymph node cells were higher in the PBS group than the vaccine group, suggesting that the Lactobacillus vaccine effectively inhibited TLR expression. The recombinant Lactobacillus groups exhibited jejuna and ilea with lymphocyte proliferation in the lamina propria. Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus infection resulted in antibody production from primed mesenteric lymph node cells following an in vitro boost with viral antigen (Berthon et al. 1990 ); as an intestinal infectious disease, TGEV would attack the intestinal tissue and local immune system. Exposure of pigs to TGEV or PRCV results in distinct disease patterns related to differences in tissue tropism (Saif 1996) . However, the increased frequencies of TLR-2 and TLR-9 expression in pigs may simply be due to the significantly higher counts of L. casei or MDP and tuftsin, which may translate to an increased magnitude of TLR agonists available to stimulate the host mucosal immune system. It is likely that the higher LAB count in the LAB plus HRV group played a more pertinent role in the significant increases in TLR2 and TLR9 expression (Wen et al. 2009 ). Taken together, TGEV immune protection was primarily dependent on the mucosal immune response. Systemic immunity did not play a key role after TGEV infection. Interestingly, IL-17 expression in the vaccine group was significant higher than IL-17 expression in the PBS group challenged with TGEV, and Th17 played an anti-inflammatory role in mucosal immunity. IL-17 also stimulated intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and growth.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our study suggests that the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine provokes specific mucosal and systemic immune responses to protect piglets from infection. IgA played a dominant role in the mucosal immune response after TGEV challenge. Therefore, the histopathology and RNA copy numbers directly demonstrated that the Lactobacillus vaccine was effective for TGEV infection. The protective efficacy was significantly higher, which would have great value in practice. Moreover, although the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine-induced Th1 immunity, the immune balance was broken by TGEV infection; thus, the immunized piglets initiated a Th2 immune response against TGEV infection. Taken together, we showed that IL-17 signalling was vital for Lactobacillus vaccine immunized piglets infected with TGEV. The Lactobacillus vaccine also inhibited TLR expression, which indicated that most of virus was neutralized because the TLRs were not activated by the virus.",
