However, the global spread of infections such as West Nile and corona viruses, and the need to address the potential threat of bioterrorism, has boosted public interest in, and government support of, countermeasures for infectious diseases. The attractive features of monoclonal antibodies, such as high specificity and effective recruitment of the immune system, would seem to make them excellent candidates as anti-infective agents. Here, we analyse trends in the development and approval of anti-infective monoclonal antibodies, and discuss factors that influence their success.",

Nevertheless, numerous candidates are undergoing preclinical and clinical study, and ample medical needs exist for targeted anti-infective treatments. With careful selection of indications and mAb characteristics (such as specificity, avidity and isotype), opportunities exist for the development of safe and efficacious anti-infective mAbs that would complement the arsenal of vaccines and anti-infective drugs. Some caution is advisable because, despite an increase in government funding for development, the markets for countermeasures to many pathogens have not yet been clearly defined.",

Probabilities of success were calculated for products that entered clinical study in the 1980s and the 1990s.

A 'war on cancer' had been declared in 1971, but efficacious oncology products were still very much in demand a decade later. Nevertheless, a number of companies explored the judicious use of anti-infective mAbs in areas in which medical need was as yet unmet by vaccines or anti-infective drugs -for example, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human rhinovirus infections, and sepsis.",

The presence of competitive products could be one explanation for the dearth of anti-infective mAbs in development. We examined marketed and pipeline vaccines and anti-infective drugs to assess whether these products might provide competition to mAbs in development. We focused on products targeting hepatitis C and HIV viral infections, and B. anthracis, pathogenic Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus bacterial infections because most (76%) of anti-infective mAbs in the clinic (TABLE 2) are treatments for these five pathogens.",

In general, the unique functionalities and higher probabilities of approval success of mAbs compared with small molecules make them attractive for diversification of company pipelines. However, only a small number of anti-infective mAbs are currently under clinical study and few seem ready to enter the clinic. Challenges specific to the development of mAbs as anti-infective agents have clearly caused companies to proceed with caution in this area. Treatment with mAbs is passive immunization, but unlike vaccination, anti-infective mAbs can provide only short-term prophylaxis. The parenteral routes of administration for mAbs are decidedly less convenient than the oral administration of many anti-infective drugs. Production of mAbs is complicated and costly compared with that of many vaccines and drugs. So far, the most optimistic overall approval success rate we calculated for anti-infective mAbs (11%) is lower than that for anti-infective drugs (16%) produced by major pharmaceutical firms 11 , though it must be noted that some of the approved anti-infective drugs are derivative versions of previously successful products, whereas the approved anti-infective mAb is novel. As a consequence of these factors, competition from vaccines and antiinfective drugs has focused mAb development in niche applications in which medical need exists for new treatments.",

Development of anti-infective agents can also be facilitated through use of FDA regulations colloquially referred to as the 'animal rule' . This rule was proposed in 1999 and published in final form in 2002 15 . The animal rule states that FDA approval may be based on evidence of effectiveness from adequate and well-controlled studies in animals. However, safety in humans must also be established and results of animal studies must establish that the product is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans. Approvals under the rule therefore absolutely require the existence of appropriate animal models for the infectious diseases.",
