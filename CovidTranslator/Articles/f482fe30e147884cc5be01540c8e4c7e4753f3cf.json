Pigs of all age can be infected by PED virus from neonates to sows or boars but the fatality rate of PED in swine depends on age 3 . The morbidity and mortality of PED in 10-day-old piglets are less than piglets under 5 days old that may reach 100% in death because of severe diarrhea and dehydration 4 . The older pigs are able to recover within 7 to 10 days but can re-infect within five months 4 .",

However, the disease is highly contagious and rapidly infect throughout the year to both industrial and small pig farms. Swine (Sus scrofa) are the only natural hosts for PED virus infection. Kamau et al. (2010) investigated the ability of using specific pathogen free mice as a potential vector in PED virus transmission. Nevertheless, molecular tests and serological data showed no antibodies detection so mice and rat were not susceptible vectors of the PED transmission 6 .

After that the disease widely spread throughout many swine-raising countries in Western Europe: Hungary (1981); Germany (1981); to Asian countries: Japan (1982); South Korea (2000) ; Taiwan (2013) and North America (2013) 11 . During the 1970s and 1990s, a few severe PED outbreaks have been reported in Europe 12 . Nevertheless, PEDV infection nowadays has become epidemic in Asia pig industries, consist of China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines and Taiwan 13 . In China, a large-scale diarrhea outbreak was reported in the end of 2010 with the confirmation of PEDV in pig population that over 1,000,000 piglets died with a mortality rate of 80%-100% and resulted enormous economic losses 14, 15 . In South Korea, the PEDV was firstly described in 1992 and re-emerged as a severe outbreak during 2013 with considerable variants that were different from previous Korean isolates or vaccine strains 16, 17 . A massive PED outbreak suddenly occurred in the North American pig farm in April 2013 and rapidly spread across the country also to countries sharing the same border: Canada (2014) and Mexico (2013); causing high rates of mortality and huge economic losses 2, 3 .",

            "text": "Although the PED disease has similarly clinical signs to transmissible gastro-enteritis (TGE) including anorexia; vomiting; diarrhea and dehydration, the causative agent PED virus is antigenically distinguishable from TGE virus (TGEV) and haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) 4 . The PED virus belongs to the member of genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae which constitutes the order Nidoviracles and causes acute diarrhea in human and animals, especially fatal to newborn individuals 18, 19 . Under the electron microscopy (EM), the characteristic appearance of PEDV contains an opaque and pleomorphic body about 90 to 190 nm diameter in range, with an electron-dense core, a large fringe and bulb-shaped projections of approximately 20 nm but the detailed internal structure of PED virus remains unknown 1, 7 . The PED virus adapts culture to be stable at wide range of pH from 5.0 to 9.0 at 4\u2103 and still keeps infectivity between pH 6.5 and 7.5 at 37\u2103 1,20 . However, this virus is sensitive to high temperature when heating to or over 60\u2103 for 30 minutes and to chemical reagents such as ether and chloroform 1 . Besides, most disinfectants are effective to against PEDV, consisting of cresol, formalin (1%), anhydrous sodium carbonate (4%), sodium hydroxide (2%), iodophors (1%) in phosphoric acid, ionic and non-ionic detergents. More than 10 years after the first identification of PEDV, the effort of growing PEDV in cell culture was successfully proved in the study of Hofmann M. and Wyler R. (1988) 21, 22 . The Vero cell (derived from African green monkey kidney) culture with the presence of trypsin was susceptible for PED virus propagation. In another research, Shibata et al. (1999) described additional methods to isolate PEDV using pig bladder cell-and kidney cell-derived cultures, also in the presence of trypsin in the medium because trypsin allowed the in vitro propagation of several enteric viruses and facilitated coronavirus growth as an important ingredient in the cell culture media 23 .",

            "text": "The PEDV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome with approximately 28,000 bases in size with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail (Poly A) 9, 24 . The PEDV genome comprises at least 7 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode three non-structural proteins (ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF3) and four structural proteins (ORF2, ORF4-6) 1,8,25 (Figure 1 ). The viral genome organization followed a conserved gene order: an untranslated region (UTR) at 5\u2032-end; the large ORF1a and 1b that cover 70% at the 5\u2032-end of genome for polymerase genes; a set of four genes encoding the structural proteins: 150-220 kDa glycosylated spike protein (S), 7 kDa envelope protein (E), 27-36 kDa membrane protein (M) and 58 kDa nucleocapsid protein (N); and a 3\u2032UTR 1, 8, 26 . Table 1 Based on all sequences of coronaviruses, the ORF1a (nt 297-12650) and ORF1b (nt 12605-20641) shared slightly overlapping sequences at a possible ribosomal frameshift (RFS) site 7, 8 . The ORF1a translated for a replicase polyprotein 1a (pp1a) which could be extended into pp1ab at C-terminal of RFS site and encoded for several functional motifs such as three protease: papain-like proteinase (Plp), X domain (X), poliovirus 3C-like proteinase (3C1) and one growth factor-like motif (Gfl), whereas there were a metal ion binding domain (Mb), a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain (RdRp) and a helicase motif (Hel) that could be encoded within ORF1b by analogy to amino acid sequences of other coronaviruses 25 . The post-translational cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab resulted in a group of 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) by internal proteases. The ORF3 is a functional accessory gene which located between S and E structural protein. It is conserved among canine coronavirus type I and encodes a glycoprotein gp3 that is concerned to virulence of PEDV in the natural host and to be functional as an ion channel but not generally related to viral replication in cultured cells 1,27,28 . Song et al. (2002) analyzed ORF3 in restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to differentiate the Korean PEDV, KPEDV-9 field strains from wild-type strains for application in vaccine against PEDV infection 28 . This study suggested that the loss of ORF3 production or the changes in sequence of ORF3 resulted in unexpected consequence of the adaption of PEDV in cell culture. The E proteins, one of four structural components in PEDV, are recognized as a small, hydrophobic transmembrane protein of coronaviruses with 76-109 amino acids (aa) in length that are rather divergent among different coronavirus strains 29, 30 . It was found that they play a remarkable role on the morphogenesis and viral assembly where they could prompt the curvature of membrane as well as assist in membrane scission 31, 32 . Besides, the E proteins without modifications are also integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane where they are independent of inducing ER stress 33 . Another investigation of E protein expression in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells demonstrate the crucial function in altering membrane permeability 34 and apoptosis promotion 35, 36 . Additionally the E proteins are observed the interaction with host-cell proteins and in vitro ion channel activity which is more selective for monovalent cations and is blocked by hexamethylene amiloride in other coronaviruses 37 . The co-expression of E protein and a major membrane M glycoprotein, via their cytoplasmic domains localizing to pre-Golgi membranes, allows the generation of coronavirus-like pseudoparticles which were identified same size with TGEV virions 33, 38 . In recent studies of other coronaviruses, the absence of E proteins leads to two actions: non-infectious virions and the inhibition of full virus growth 39 .",

Further, another important role of CT region of the PEDV spike protein, which was determined by a signal: a dibasic (KxxHxx-COOH), was accountable to retrieve this protein in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), whereas the S protein with a mutation (H \u2192 R) or lack of this motif resulted in enhanced cell surfaces expression of S protein. Nevertheless the role of a potential tyrosine-based (YxxF motif) signal of CT region remains unknown [53] [54] [55] . The interaction between S proteins and M or E proteins (as mentioned before), which is essential for virus assembly into those intracellular vesicles, involved in the localization of S protein in the ERGIC. Some studies showed that the S protein were not essential for budding of coronavirus particle but needed for infectivity. By culturing coronaviruses MHV A59 in the presence of antibiotic tunicamycin, Rottier et al. (1982) found that the spikeless and noninfectious virions were produced 56 . Additionally, Luytjes et al.

Although the PED virus and TGE virus are serological distinct, this study based on the CO-26K, a collagenase-digested fragment, of the TGEV S protein to find the critical virus-neutralizing epitope located in the S protein of PEDV. By analyzing the neutralizing activity of the polyclonal antisera and comparing the sequences of COE (CO-26K equivalent) gene of spike protein among PEDV strains (PEDV CV777 strain, Korean isolate and PEDV Brl/87), this study suggested that the COE region of PEDV spike protein contained an important virus-neutralizing epitope with no cross-neutralization (based on very low homology in the same region comparing with feline infectious peritonitis virus, FIPV and TGEV).",

The encoded polypeptides range of PEDV N protein is from 377 to 455 amino acids and has the similar physical properties with the other members of the family Coronaviridae 60 . Nevertheless one unique sequence with a 40-residuelong insertion in the central position of PEDV N protein molecule could reflect recombinant event or stuttering of the viral polymerase. This sequence is particularly rich in arginine (Arg), serine (Ser) and asparagine (Asp) residues, and presents in PED virus N protein with no counterpart in the remainder of Coronaviruses. The N protein can be an alternative target to accurately diagnosis PEDV in early infection. Furthermore, Xu et al. (2013) generated a specific cell line IEC (porcine intestinal epithelial cell) expressed PEDV N protein as well as investigated the function and localization of N protein 60, 61 . The study suggested that PEDV N protein affected on cycle progression, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression, cell growth and survival. Particularly the PEDV N protein was identified in the ER membrane, induced cell cycle prolongation at the S-phage, which is associated with a low level of cyclin A transcription and increased in cyclin A degradation, and was responsible for ER stress, which included the initiation of an inflammatory react via activation of NF-kB, as well as up-regulation interleukin-8 expression 60,61 . This study was the first report to demonstrate novel functions of PEDV N protein that was useful in investigating the molecular mechanisms and PEDV pathogenesis.",

Many techniques are available for the detection of PEDV from fecal materials, small infected intestines sample, including reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), direct immunofluorescence tests (IF), indirect fluorescence antibody tests (IFA), immunohistochemistry techniques (IHC), in situ hydridization, electron microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) 2 .

(1995) evaluated the PEDV-infected lesions using transmission EM (TEM) technique, nevertheless the result showed a mix of coronaviruses within the cytoplasm and microvilli of epithelial cells in small intestine 63 . After that they carried out a streptavidin-biotin (SAB) technique to detect the specific viral antigen of PED in the cytoplasm of enterocytes, with light microscopy. This method examined formalin-fixed materials with a serial of washing step and no cryostat that demonstrated adequately detailed diagnosis methods for outbreak of PEDV occurred in Japan. In case the spikes of virus were lost or not clearly visible, the TEM results were inconclusive to confirm that the causative agents were PEDV or viruses with the similar size and morphology, especially TGEV. For the reason that the EM technique is not sensitive and specific, it could not be applied to differentiate PED virus from the remainder of coronaviruses, especially TGE virus. Shibata et al. (1999) employed virus neutralization (VN) test and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to detect antibodies against PEDV as well as the immunohistochemical examination for the detection of PEDV antigens in the enterocytes of infected pigs by avidin-biotin (AB) technique 12 . The paper determined the isolation of PEDV using porcine cell cultures (as mentioned before), whereas established the SB1 and SB2 cells derived from the epithelial cells of cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pig bladder and the SK cells prepared from the CDCD pig kidney for different passage state, instead of using popular methods with Vero cells. Furthermore, this study discovered the effect of different pig age on the disease, in particular, the severe clinical signs were only found in two-day and one-week old piglets. So this research concluded that there was an age-dependent resistance to PED virus in swine. Until now, the Vero cell lines are the most popular and effective to isolate PED virus. Pan et al. (2012) used the Vero cell cultures to isolate CHGD-01 PEDV strain as well as employed direct immunofluorescence assay and EM technique to investigate its specific cytopathic effects in the outbreak of diarrhea in Guangdong (South China) swine 18 . The study also reported the susceptibility of Vero cells to different PEDV strains because the characteristic CPE caused by PEDV isolate in this research was not confirmed until seven passages of Vero cells. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome, the CHGD-01 isolates were placed in a cluster with two other Chinese strains, sharing almost 98% of nucleotide sequence identities. However, this recent Chinese strain might have originated from the Korean PEDV strains KNU 0802, based on amino acid sequence analysis of viral spike protein gene.",

(1996) designed three primer sequences from the membrane protein (M) gene of PEDV for RT-PCR test 64 . The result of this study proved that a positive DNA band of KPEDV-9 M gene could be early detected from fecal specimens at 24 h post-infection in experimentally inoculated pigs. The research from Ishikawa et al. (1997) was in the close agreement with the conclusion of RT-PCR as a practical, rapid and specific method for detecting PEDV in swine 65 . The study developed a RT-PCR detection system by using primers to amplify an 854 bp fragment of M protein gene of PEDV. The RT-PCR system in this study could effectively detect PEDV RNA from viral mixtures or small intestinal/ fecal samples in very low number of virus within short time. The virus isolation and the SAB technique were employed to confirm PEDV positive results by RT-PCR, based on virus and its antigen detection. Moreover, a serial dilution of PEDV JMe2 strain for RT-PCR was conducted to evaluate the ability of this assay to amplify viral RNA from small intestinal samples and fecal specimens as well as to eliminate the inhibitors of RT-PCR in specimens. Previous studies have showed difference in the sensitivity of RT-PCR assay. This could be explained by the difference in RNA extract processes, RT-PCR conditions or the presence of inhibitors in the intestinal and fecal samples that could affect the sensitivity of RT-PCR. There were many factors in the intestinal and fecal specimen that could inhibit the activity of thermostable polymerase in enzymatic reaction of PCR amplification, especially the presence of bilirubin and bile salts 66, 67 . To enhance the specificity and sensitivity of RT-PCR, the extraction process of viral RNA and PCR conditions need to be optimized and chemical reagents that prevented the inhibition factors in raw materials, were advised to use. In the reverse transcription step, the RT-PCR also revealed high potential in cross contamination during mass screening, however. Kim et al. (2007) improved the molecular detection methods of PEDV by generating a multiplex real-time RT-PCR employing 2 sets of primers and different probes labeling with reporter dyes in a single reaction tube 68 . The primers and probes were designed and synthesized base on conserved sequence of the nucleocapsid N genes from a number of strains of TGEV and PEDV, and were labeled with specific dyes for each virus: 5\u2032-reporter dye FAM and 3\u2032-quencher BHQ1 for TGEV, 5\u2032-reporter dye Cy-5 and 3\u2032-quencher BHQ2 for PEDV. The selection of primers and probes which based on the highly conversed regions of nuclecapsid gene of the CV777 strain of PEDV and the Purdue 46-MAD strain of PEDV as well as using the same concentrations for both of them could optimize this assay. The multiplex real-time RT-PCR was able to differentially detect and qualify the PEDV and TGEV rapidly from both experimentally and naturally infected pigs, with no cross-reaction between diarrhea-causing viruses. This assay also saved the time-consuming comparing to complete RT-PCR-based dot blot hybridization and minimized the rate of contamination by reducing the number of experimental steps. Hence, the RT-PCRbased technique was considered as a useful and practical method for rapid, sensitive and specific detection of PEDV infection in fecal samples from live pigs, with out killing.",

The study generated simultaneously 2 separate blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and an indirect fluorescence test (IFT) in order to detect both PEDV antigen in fecal samples and PEDV antibodies in serum, using monoclonal antibodies (MAb) as capture and reporter agents. The results indicated that the antibodies in both natural and experimental PEDV infections were detected by ELISA in shorter time than by IFT (3-5 days sooner). Hence the MAb-based ELISA was considered higher sensitive method allowing the diagnosis of PEDV infection in diarrhea endemic and on farm. However, there was unknown reason between ELISA-negative but IFT-positive results that remained in this study. In another research, the competitive blocking ELISA (CB-ELISA) was generated to identify PEDV in culture medium and fecal samples, evolving non-conjugated monoclonal antibodies to membrane M protein of PEDV. This study also showed the low correlation of sensitivity between the EM technique and the CB-ELISA that only 3/15 fecal samples was positive with coronavirus by EM examination while the negative results of CB-ELISA was 14% (9/65 fecal samples). Hou et al. (2007) based on recombinant 48 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein of PEDV as a useful antigen to develop an ELISA (rnELISA) for detecting antibodies to PEDV 18 . The RT-PCR was conducted to amplify nucleocapsid N protein gene from the PEDV Korean strain, using forward and reverse primer containing restriction enzyme sites (BamHI and SacI). After subcloning into the prokaryotic expression vector pQE-30, the recombinant plasmid pQE30-PN was transformed into host cell (Escherichia coli) to produce the PEDV soluble nucleocapsid proteins with an N-terminal His6-tag of 442 amino acids. The recombinant N proteins were purified by affinity chromatography in Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody before applying to rnEL-ISA for PEDV detection. Besides, the limitation of rnELISA was determined by a cut-off value that was calculated as absorbance values among 80 serum samples from field, based on the mean value plus two SDs (standard deviation). In the additional confirmation from RT-PCR and the serum neutralization (SN) tests, the recombinant N protein IgG ELISA obtained 98% sensitivity (among 103 clinical PEDV-infected sam-ples) and 98.7% specificity (among 80 PEDV-free samples) compared to RT-PCR in methodologies as well as this recombinant protein-based serological test only reached 8.5% false-positive results by antibody detection in 18 of 213 SN negative results. The study indicated that the nucleocapsid N protein might be a sensitive antigen for the serological diagnosis of PEDV and the rnELISA had high sensitivity and specificity for a rapid and simple method for the large-scale detection of PEDV.",

The six MAbs specific for PEDV, which were generated and characterized from the screening of forty hybridomas by indirect IF and indirect ELISA using non-infected and PEDV-infected cells, were purified and modified with horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugation before applying to DAS-ELISA. The six selected MAbs were surveyed the intensity and specificity in different combination, i.e. 1F12 as conjugated MAb and MAb 4C3 as antigen catching antibody, for the best catcher and tracer in DAS-ELISA. The comparison of DAS-ELISA and RT-PCR indicated the complicated correlation between intestinal and fecal samples. For the fecal examining, the high kappa statistic value suggested an almost perfect agreement in two methods that only 2 of 215 samples were ELISA-negative but RT-PCR-positive identification. This could be explained that the clinical samples were collected in the recovery period of disease with the low viral titres and the forms of specific antibody in faeces were immunocomplexes. However the intestinal examination by two methods gave a disagreement because there were 7 samples of RT-PCR negative but ELISA positive. The disagreement might be due to the non-specific binding of antibodies in ELISA reaction and the available inhibitors of PCR assay. These finding agreed with previous studies that serological test-ELISAs were rapid and sensitive for the screening of a large number of specimens so the PEDV-ELISAs were suitable and effective in controlling PED disease during epizootic outbreaks.",

            "text": "In a research by Guscetti et al. (1998) , four methods were compared for diagnosis of wild-type PEDV: an immunohistochemical detection using formalin-fixed tissues, a direct immunofluorescence assay using cryo-stat sections, an ELISA and a PCR method 71 . This study showed that the ELISA results confirmed a sensitive and reliable detection in fecal material for PEDV but the presence of false positive reactions might affect the results when using for large number of specimen samples or samples from different infected animals in clinical practice. The PCR methods were ineffective in this study because wrong negative results were indicated by the other methods but the virus purification step before RNA extraction could enhance this method. According to conclusion of this research, the IHC and IF methods, which were used to detect viral antigen from gut tissues, demonstrated very high sensitivity and reliability, allowing detection for more than 75% enterocytes were positive for viral antigen by IHC in the mid-jejunum particularly. In contrast, the RT-PCR used in the recent study was indicated to be a simple, rapid, specific and sensitive method for the identification of PEDV from fecal samples. Kim and Chae (2012) used and compared reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IH) technique, and in situ hybridization for detection of PEDV in fifteen experimental PEDV-infected pigs and 94 samples of diarrheic piglets 72 . For the intestinal and fecal samples from experimental PEDV-inoculated pigs, the RT-PCR could detect viral antigen and nucleic acid in all samples (15/15) while the IH and in situ hybridization could not identify the causative agent in 1/15 and 2/15 samples, respectively. For PEDV detection of diarrheic pigs in fecal samples, 63/94 samples were positive and 15/94 samples were negative for causative PEDV by all 3 methods, indicating a high agreement and correlation (83%) among these methods. The high rate of agreement demonstrated that the 3 methods could be applied independently to accumulate an accurate diagnosis for PEDV infection. This study also indicated how to choose the suitable technique to diagnose PEDV depends on the available types of sample. The RT-PCR test was recommended for virus detection if only fecal samples were provided whilst the immunohistochemistry (Figure 2 ) and in situ hybridization were suggested for more sensitive detection of PEDV in formalin-fixed intestinal samples 72 . Due to the special features such as rapid detection, high sensitivity and specificity, and cost-effectiveness, the RT-PCR is considered as an important and successful test for detection of PEDV both laboratory and field virus strains.",

Nowadays, the PED epidemic outbreaks, which neonatal pigs are involved, tend to be more serious and dangerous in Asia countries than in Europe and others with the sufficient economic loss. Therefore, several trials of PEDV vaccine were mainly researched and developed in Asia countries such as attenuated vaccine PPEDV-9 strain in Korea, P-5V and 96-P4C6 strain in Japan, CV777-attenuated or inactivated vaccines in China [73] [74] [75] . In sow, neonatal pigs are normally protected until they are 13-day-old by a transfer of IgG maternal antibodies from colostrum and milk of immune mothers 1 . Beside the 60% of IgG accounting in colostrum immunoglobulin content, there are IgM and especially IgA which is more resistant and has high virus neutralizing activity than IgG 76 . However, these antibodies from passive immunity are not able to prevent the intestinal infection of PEDV.",

The piglets intramuscularly or orally inoculated with attenuated virus of high passage level did not reveal any severe symptoms of diarrhea or death comparing to the animal with wild PEDV-infection, so an alternative vaccine might be developed from attenuated virus deriving from serial passage of PEDV. This study also indicated that the vaccinated pregnant sows by intramuscular inoculation had the low mortality rate of piglets. Another researcher group generated a Vero cell attenuated PEDV DR13 which was differed from wild-type PEDVs by a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern 77 . The study compared the ability of the cell attenuated DR13 virus after inoculation via oral (O) and intramuscular (IM) routes in late-term pregnant sows to protect neonatal pigs against PED, employing the SN test and ELISA. The experiment of the immunoprophylactic effect in pregnant pigs showed the similar agreement with the research by Kweon et al. (1999) in decreasing mortality of piglets but cell-adapted DR13 vaccination in this study through oral route 74 . Previously, PEDV DR13 was also isolated in Vero cells through serial passage at level 100 and was analyzed for differentiation from other Korean field strain via RT-PCR RFLP with HindIII and XhoII enzymes. Moreover, the investigation of cell-adapted DR13 indicated the reduced virulence after high serial passage as well as its immune response in 14-day-old piglets and pregnant sows. The attenuation and safety of high serial passage DR13 after oral vaccination were also discussed in this study. Hou et al. (2007) targeted the nucleocapsid N protein of PEDV to develop a recombinant vaccine trial by employing a surface antigen display system on lactobacilli 78 . This system used the poly-\u03b3-glutamate A (pgsA) protein, which is a synthetase complex of Bacillus subtilis, as the transmembrane anchor to express heterologous antigens in the surface of Lactobacillus casei525. The live and dead L. casei anchoring nucleocapsid protein of PEDV were vaccinated to two animal models: intranasal and oral inoculation of mouse, oral inoculation in pregnant sows that induced the systemic and local immune responses in both. The rnELI-SA were carried out to indicate the high levels of serum IgG and mucosal IgA after inoculation. Moreover, the IgG levels of piglets were highly increased after receiving colostrum secreted from vaccinated sows with recombinant L. casei. The surface antigen expression system on LAB (lactic acid bacteria) was potential for vaccine applications to against PED but limited in the display size of foreign antigens.",
