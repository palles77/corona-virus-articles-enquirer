Understanding the incidence rate of pediatric pneumonia and identifying the pathogen for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) forms the basis for diagnosis, therapeutic treatment, and intervention. In a study of 154 children hospitalized for CAP in the United States, between January 1999 and March 2000, a period prior to the universal use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), Michelow et al., 2) identified a bacterial pathogen in 60% of cases of pneumonia. The Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria strain was identified in 73% of bacterial pathogen. S. pneumoniae was a common pathogen of CAP at that time. 2) The causal pathogen of CAP was very different in a survey of children under the age of 18 years who were hospitalized for pneumonia in designated hospitals in southern and Western part of US, between January 2010 and June 2012, a period after the universal use of PCV. 1) In this latter survey, a viral or bacterial cause was identified in 81% of cases, with more than one kind of virus detected in 66% of cases. 1) An exclusive bacterial cause was identified in only 8% of cases, with both bacterial and viral causes identified in 7% of cases. Therefore, by 2012, viruses had emerged as more significant pathogens of pneumonia than bacteria.",

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (50.7%) was the most common organism in all age groups and bacteria was 5.9%. S. pneumoniae (88.9%) was the major cause of bacterial pneumonia including mixed infection. 5) S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were major bacterial pathogens of pneumonia. S. pneumoniae had caused 11% of deaths in children aged under 5 years globally in the pre-PCV era. 6) As medical costs associated with pneumonia are substantial, there have been continuous worldwide efforts to reduce the rate of pneumoniaassociated morbidity and mortality, including the use of vaccines. Changes in complications, morbidity, and the rate of pneumonia of PCV use were analyzed in the United States but not in Korea. The aim of the study was to describe the epidemiology of CAP in Korea, including yearly trends in incidence, frequency of viral and bacterial pathogens and the impact of PCV.",

[8] [9] [10] The pathogens for CAP varied widely based on age, region, and season. Bacteria and viruses were the most typical pathogens, with M. pneumoniae being a common pathogen among preschool-aged children. The difficulty in identifying the causative pathogen due to difficulty in collecting specimen, such a sputum or mouth culture, for microbiological diagnosis, likely explains why an etiology was not specified in two-thirds of our cases. Among those with a clear etiology, viral pathogens were the most common, followed by M. pneumoniae and bacteria. In our case series from 2007 through 2014, the highest prevalence of viral pneumonia occurred in 2009 due to an outbreak of H1N1 influenza, although the prevalence of viral pneumonia did increase from 2007 through 2014 (Table 3) . We speculate that the introduction of multiplex real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) improved the diagnosis of viral pathogens of pneumonia in Korea over the 8-year period of our study. 11, 12) In fact, our data clearly indicate this, with an increase in the diagnosis of human metapneumovirus pneumonia using multiplex RT-PCR since 2011. Multiplex RT-PCR is a test for the addition of human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus to conventional respiratory virus detection (respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus). In Korea, a study on respiratory virus using multiplex RT-PCR has been started in 2006 13, 14) and was gradually expanded. 11, 14) Human metapneumovirus was a newly discovered virus, and it would take time for the ICD code to be created and used in Korea.",

Over our 8-year study period, although not significant, though, the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia decreased between 2007 and 2014, with the exception of a unique spike in 2011. The increase in the total number of patients with pneumonia, the number of patients with bacterial pneumonia, the number of patients with pleural effusion and empyema in 2011 and the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia among children in the 4-6 and 7-12 years age groups in 2011 are speculated to have resulted from an nationwide MP epidemic extending from late 2010 to early 2012 (Fig. 2) . The increased prevalence three years later (2013-2014) also likely resulted from a MP epidemic.",

The decreased prevalence of CAP was more evident in children under the age of 2 years. 23) The PCV7 was introduced in Korea in November 2003, with the PCV10 and PCV13 introduced in June 2010 as an optional. In May 2014, PCV10 and PCV13 were incorporated in the national immunization program in Korea. 21) With regard to the immunization rate achieved, about 40% of the candidates for vaccination are estimated to have received the PCV7 as of 2007. 15) The 2011 national immunization rate survey of 3-year-old children (born in 2007) reported a PCV vaccination rate of 67.1% for the first dose, 60.5% for the second dose, 56.7% for the third dose, and 51.4% for the fourth dose, with a complete vaccination rate of 49.7%. 24) The 2013 national immunization rate survey of three-year-old children (born in 2009) showed an increased rate of PCV vaccination, with a vaccination rate of 83.4% for the first dose, 80.5% for the second dose, 77.8% for the third dose, and 70.4% for the fourth dose. 25) Although we could not evaluate immunization rate among the patients included in our analysis, we were able to confirm a vaccination rate of 50% among 3 years old in our 2007 cohort, which increased to about 70% for this age group in 2013. A limitation of our data set, which spans 2007-2014, is the difficulty in determining if the decline in pleural effusion and empyema could be explained by an increase rate of vaccination with the PCV7 or the introduction of the PCV10 and the PCV13 in 2010. The cyclical MP epidemic in Korea also influences the prevalence of pneumonia, making difficult to clearly distinguish the effects of PCV7 from those of the PCV10 or the PCV13.",

Nevertheless, our analysis of a relatively large cohort of children with pneumonia over an 8-year period does provide evidence of a declining prevalence of bacterial pneumonia, pleural effusion and empyema with the Korean J Pediatr 2018;61(9):291-300 exception of a unique spike in prevalence in 2011. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of the probable contribution of the PCV vaccination program in lowering the risk for pneumonia in children and adolescents.",

Infants <1 year of age also had high rates of ED hospitalization, presumably due to factors related to their age. Newborn and infants <1 year of age accounted for the highest proportion of pediatric patients diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, because of their physiological tendency for gastro esophageal reflux. 27) The yearly ICU admission rate declined over the study period, from 2007 to 2014. Domestic humidifier disinfectants were used until 2011, therefore severe interstitial lung disease was nationally prevalent. Since 2011, the use of humidifier disinfectants has been banned, severe interstitial lung disease has been reduced. It would have contributed in part to the reduction in the hospitalization rate of pneumonia and the rate of admission to the ICU. 28) In this study, bacterial pneumonia and empyema found significant seasonality in December and May, respectively. This is similar to the results of previous studies in other areas of PCV introduction and the cause of seasonality in pneumococcal disease. 29, 30) These results suggest that prevention of severe pneumonia complications, vaccination and health measures are needed more.",

Discussion Over the 8-year period of our study, from 2007 to 2014, the prevalence of ED visits for pediatric pneumonia increased, spiking in 2009 and 2014.
