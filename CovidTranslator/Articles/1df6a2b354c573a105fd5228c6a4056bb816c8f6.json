However, it is challenging to model the behavior of epidemics based on social contact networks due to their high dynamics. Traditional models such as susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model ignore the crowding or protection effect and thus has some unrealistic assumption. In this paper, we consider the crowding or protection effect and develop a novel model called improved SIR model. Then, we use both deterministic and stochastic models to characterize the dynamics of epidemics on social contact networks. The results from both simulations and real data set conclude that the epidemics are more likely to outbreak on social contact networks with higher average degree. We also present some potential immunization strategies, such as random set immunization, dominating set immunization, and high degree set immunization to further prove the conclusion.",

The standard SIR model based on assumptions that the networks are homogenous which means all nodes have the same linkage and the probability that there is a link between any two nodes are equal. However, recent research works have shown that the social contact networks have community structure [3] - [5] in which nodes have different linkages and nodes have more links within a cluster than that of between communities. Thus, when there is a significant number of infected individuals in a community, the effected contacts (the contacts that transmit diseases) between susceptible and infected individuals do not grow quickly. This phenomenon is called ''crowding'' or ''protection effect'' [6] . Therefore, the linear force of infection used in the standard SIR model has limitation under the typical scenario.",

There nodes are often called ''hubs'', and they are more likely to be infected quickly when an epidemic outbreaks. The social contact networks are considered to be scale-free networks [10] , [11] , whose degree distribution follows a power law, at least asymptotically. The Barab\u00e1si-Albert (BA) model is usually used to generate artificial social contact networks [12] . We studied the propagation of the epidemic diseases in BA network and also evaluate some immunization strategies.

            "text": "Due to the ''crowding'' or ''protection effect'', the force of infection will not grow quickly with the increase of number of infected individuals. [15] , [16] propose a force of infection model, which is \u03b2I 2 , in which \u03b2 is contact rate and I is number of infected individuals. All symbols and notations used in the paper are listed in Table 1 . The authors use this model to study the dynamic of epidemics. However, the model shows the force of infection grows faster when the fraction of infected individuals becomes big, which ignores the facts of ''crowding'' or ''protection effect''. [6] , [17] propose more general force of infection models which also consider the ''intervation affect''. When the fraction of infected individuals is large, some intervention policies may be placed, such as closing restaurants and schools. In these models, the force of infection is set to be \u03b1I 2 /(b+I 2 ). However, it is difficult to estimate the effect of these kinds of interventions, especially when several intervention strategies are combined to use. In this work, we proposed a nonlinear force of infection in format of \u03b2I /(1 + \u03b1I ), to consider the ''crowding'' and ''protection effect'', which are ignored in existing models. The deterministic epidemic model can predict the overall infected individuals, but it is not able to provide the fluctuation of the total infected nodes [14] . Even when R 0 > \u03bb c , the epidemic may disappear at the early stage of the spread of epidemics. In contrast, the stochastic epidemic models are able to capture the fluctuation of dynamics of epidemic on real networks [18] . [14] studies the dynamics of epidemic using a fixed probability of infection, but a node representing a person with more infected neighbors are more likely to be infected in reality. [19] uses a linear probability of infection. However, the infection of a node from its infected neighbors should be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). Therefore, in this paper, a q-influence model is used to simulate the propagation of epidemics on social The social contact networks are considered to be scale-free networks [10] , [11] . A social contact networks generator, named BA generator, is widely used to generate artificial social networks as the generated network satisfies the statistics of the real social contact networks. The random immunization of the network has been studied in [14] . A wide variety of epidemic control strategies have been proposed and evaluated by kinds of frameworks. An enhancing risk communication method has been proposed to increase the probability of successful control of diseases [20] . An optimized resource allocation algorithm is proposed in the control of epidemics under fixed budget is designed in [21] . The authors in [22] have designed a framework for modeling infectious diseases and optimizing control strategies. In [23] , the authors proposed to optimize the stabilization of disease control efficiency. The authors in [24] proposed a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of random and targeted epidemic interventions for spatially separated patches in meta-population models. In [25] , a convex framework is proposed to find cost-optimal distribution of vaccination resources when different levels of vaccination are allowed. However, these strategies are not cost-effective.",

In this work, we compare the performance of the four immunization strategies, and demonstrate that the high-degree immunization is the best one of the four immunization strategies, which also prove the fact that the high degree node usually has high impact on the epidemic spread. [2] . In the SIR model, a fixed population is represented by only three compartments: Susceptible, S(t); Infected, I (t); and Recovered, R(t). S(t) denotes the number of individuals that are not yet infected but susceptible to the diseases at time t; I (t) is used to represent the number of individuals who have been infected with the diseases at time t. Those infected individuals are capable of spreading the diseases to the susceptible individuals. R(t) is the compartment used for people who have recovered from the disease by time t. The recovered people are not able to be infected again or spread the disease to others. In the above SIR model, many of the details about the progression of infections are neglected, i.e., the differences in response between individuals. But it has been widely studied for its simplification and effectiveness. Fig. 1 shows the flow of the standard SIR model [2] .

Then social contact networks we simulated consists of N nodes with connectivity distribution P(k) \u223c k \u22123 and average connectivity k = 2m. The average connectivity, defined by the average node degree, play a major role on these networks. Table 2 shows three infection models. In the first one, a node will be infected with a fixed probability q if it has at least one infected neighbor, which means that a node with one infected neighbor has the same probability to be infected with a node has n, n > 1 infected neighbors. To consider the hierarchical infection probability, we can use the second infection model, which shows a linear probability of infections. In the second model, a node with more infected neighbors is more likely to be infected, and the infected probability is proportional to the number of infected neighbors. We use the q-influence model to show the fact that the infection probability increases faster than a linear infection. In q-influence model, the probability that a susceptible node will be infected by one of its infected neighbors is q, and the infections from all its infected neighbors are independent. So if a susceptible node has n infected nodes at time t, the probability that it will be infected at the next time by its n infected neighbors is Fig. 7 shows an example of the q-influence model, in which the central node A has five neighbors and two out of them are infected nodes. According to equation (12) , the probability that node A will be infected by its infected neighbors is p = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q) 2 . When q = 0.5, then the probability that node A will be infected is equal to 0.75. In the following of this paper, the q-influence model is utilized to simulate the propagation of the epidemics on social contact networks. ",

A critical node set is identified from the network by unequal graph partitioning (UGP) [36] . The CS immunization works by immunizing the critical node set to prevent the spreading of the diseases on the networks when epidemic outbreaks. The basic idea of UGP is to identify a subset of nodes that can disconnect the network and decompose it to a set of sub-networks when these nodes are removed. Thus the number of infected individuals will be less than the size of the largest sub-network. The algorithm of the critical node identification in UGP is as follows: 1) Get the connected component G' from the graph G, which represents a social contact network; 2) Randomly assign nodes in G' to two clusters G1 and G2; 3) Move all nodes in G1 that connect to nodes in G2 and nodes in G2 that connect to nodes in G1 to cluster G3; 4) Randomly swap nodes in G3 with nodes in G1 or G2; a swap is accepted only if the size of G3 is reduced after the swapping and it does not bring in the connections between G1 and G2. Otherwise, the swap is dropped. 5) Repeat step 4 until no further swap can reduce the size of G3. Then the set of G3 is called a critical node set. 6) Run the above steps iteratively on the sub-networks G1 and G2 until the sizes of all the sub-networks are smaller than a predefined value. The overall critical node set is the union of all critical node sets. Therefore, though this algorithm, the epidemics will be limited to spread in a sub-network if there is only one epidemic source and the number of infected individuals will be less that the size of the largest sub-network.",

Then we apply each immunization method on these two networks. The results are shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 shows the performance of four immunization strategies. It is observed that HS method is an effective strategy that outperforms k-DS and DS although our CS immunization method [36] achieves the best performance. The effectiveness of the CS method benefits from grouping high degree nodes for the immunization. Both HS and CS demonstrate that a node with high degree has the significant impact on the spread of epidemic disease and the epidemics are more likely to outbreak on social contact networks with higher average degree. We use real data set of the primary school-cumulative networks (PS), a real social networks, to evaluate the performance of these immunization strategies. As shown in Fig. 15 , both the CS and HS immunization methods can achieve the better performance than DS and k-DS methods mentioned above. The results are consistent with our studies on the BA contact social network. They not only validate the accuracy of our proposed models, but also further prove the significance of the high degree nodes for the epidemic spreading.",

We employed a stochastic model, q-influence model to simulate the propagation of epidemics on social contact networks. We examine the effectiveness of our models for epidemics spreading on both simulated and real social contact networks. The results on both networks are consistent with each other. In addition, four immunization strategies for epidemic control are evaluated using our proposed models, which demonstrate the fact that the epidemics are more likely to outbreak on social contact networks with higher average degree.",
