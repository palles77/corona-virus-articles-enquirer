It efficiently describes diseases in which a cross immune class (C) is present, along with the susceptible (S), the infected (I) and the removed (R) ones. Controlling epidemic diseases corresponds to the introduction of vaccination, quarantine and treatment strategies; generally only one of these actions is considered. In this paper the possibility of optimal controls both over the susceptible and the infected subjects is assumed, taking into account also limitations of resources. A suitable cost index is introduced and via the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle the optimal control strategy is determined and the existence of the optimal solution is assessed. Numerical results are developed analyzing the effects of different control strategies. (N. Stasio).",

In [11] it was proved that a maximum quarantine/isolation measures for the exposed and the infectious class would reduce the SARS epidemics; a bang-bang switching control was obtained. In the last decade great attention has been devoted to the modeling and control of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; in [12] an output feedback scheme based in CD4 T-cell and viral load measurements has been introduced. For the control in Dengue epidemics optimal and sub-optimal strategies were considered in [13] ; the effects of educational campaigns organized to motivate the population to break the reproduction cycle of the mosquitoes by avoiding the accumulation of still water in open-air recipients were modeled and the assumed cost index reflected a compromise between actual financial spending and population health. Optimal and suboptimal solutions were introduced also in [14] with reference to quarantine and isolation control in SARS epidemics, demonstrating that the maximal applications of the control strategies in the early stage of the epidemic were of very significant impact in both the considered control cases.",

Note that the control u assumed its maximum value at the beginning of the control period till one month and a half (more precisely, 44 days) and successively it decreased monotonically, whereas the control v augmented to its maximum value, that reached after one week since the beginning of the treatment, and then it decreased monotonically after about one month and a half. The control over the infected subjects should be reduced almost to zero after almost four months (113 days) since the beginning of the treatment. In Fig. 7 the behavior of the susceptible, infected, removed and cross immune subjects when the two optimal controls were active is shown. Also in this situation, to check the effects of the control strategy that directly acted both on susceptible and infected subjects, the same simulation of Fig. 7 was repeated in three situations: assuming no control, assuming the control only on the susceptible and finally considering the control only on the infected. In Figs. 8 and 9 the behavior of the susceptible and the infected subjects in the four analyzed situations are represented in the first seven months of the control period, respectively. As far as the number of susceptible is concerned, its reduction with respect to the initial value S 0 was almost equivalent both when the strategy with double control was adopted and when only the susceptible were controlled, with a value of about \u221270%. In absence of all control actions or in presence of control only on the infected subjects the reduction with respect to S 0 was about 67%. The effects of the control strategies over the number of infected subjects were analyzed by means of the q I quantity. It was equal to \u221231% when the double control strategy is adopted, whereas, when controlling only on the susceptible and only on the infected, the same quantity was equal to \u221226% and \u22125% respectively. This result enhanced that the strategy that controlled both the susceptible and the infected yielded a more significant reduction in the number of infected subjects than the other control strategies. Moreover, note that in the Case II, the peak of epidemic did not change significantly in time, even if, as already pointed out, changed significantly in its values, depending on the chosen control strategy.",

Two new situations were considered: a reproduction number equal to 6 and to 10, i.e. equal to the half and end point of the allowed range. In Case I, forR = 6 it was noted that the control u(t) started from the maximum value allowed and decreased at day 21, whereas the control over the infected reached the maximum value at day 16, decreasing after 2 weeks.

The same considerations hold also in the case ofR = 10, in which the reduction of the number of susceptible individuals with respect to the initial value S 0 was almost constant whereas the q I quantity was equal to \u22127% and also the peak was located significantly earlier (day 14).",

Again, the optimal solution was a maximum effort at the beginning of the disease, and successively decreased. Similar results could be observed forR = 10, with the control over the susceptible that began to decrease from the maximum value after about a week and the control over the infected that assumed the maximum value between the day four and sixteen, and then decreased. Both forR = 6 and R = 10 the reduction of the number of susceptible subjects with respect to the initial value S 0 was about of 85%, thus confirming the behavior of Case I. Even more evident was the change in the location of the peak of the epidemic, being at about day 7 and 5 respectively, with a quantity q I equal to \u22125.68% and \u22123.02% for the two choices of the reproduction number, thus denoting the effects of an epidemic with a contact rate really significant and the limit of the control strategy with the chosen control parameters, in the case of an epidemic already widespread and a control action not as effective as it could be in the Case I.",
