Methods A total of 172 infants <6 months of age hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis were tested for B. pertussis and respiratory viruses with real-time PCR. Cases were divided into 2 groups according to B. pertussis positive or negative. Clinical parameters, clinical severity scores and laboratory characteristics of the pertussis-positive and pertussis-negative cases were compared. Results Bordetella pertussis infection was detected in 44 (25.6%) of the 172 infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis, and as co-infection with respiratory viral agents in 27 (61.4%) infants. Of the 44 pertussis-positive infants, only 17 (38.6%) experienced a paroxysmal cough, 13 (29.5%) had whooping and 15 (34.1%) had post-tussive vomiting. There was no significant difference between pertussis-positive and pertussisnegative infants according to Wang clinical score at admission (4.9 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 5.2 \u00b1 2.5; p = 0.689). The overall disease severity score was also similar between the two groups (6.5 \u00b1 1.4 vs. 6.9 \u00b1 1.6; p = 0.095).",

The majority of children hospitalized for bronchiolitis are under the age of 6 mo [1] . It is known that acute bronchiolitis is predominantly a viral disease [2] . Almost 90% of cases are related to viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza, influenza and rhinovirus. In recent years new human respiratory viruses like human metapneumovirus, bocavirus and new human corona viruses have been reported, as possible pathogens causing acute bronchiolitis [3] . Bordetella pertussis has also been identified in infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis, as a single or mainly co-pathogen with respiratory viruses [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

On the other hand, a study found only 1 of 166 children admitted to the hospital during RSV season was B. pertussis positive by PCR [6] . Another study found no B. pertussis positive cases by PCR in 204 infants aged <18 mo with bronchiolitis [15] . In the index study, however, 25.5% of young infants aged <6 mo hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis had a positive pertussis PCR and nearly two-thirds of the pertussis-positive infants were coinfected with respiratory viruses such as RSV. These findings indicate that pertussis respiratory virus co-infection is common in young infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis, which is in agreement with several studies [4, 5, [7] [8] [9] .",

            "text": "Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable disease. However, even if the first dose of the pertussis vaccine provides partial protection, full infant protection may not be achieved until after [16] . Acceptable immunity against pertussis is accomplished one month after the third dose of the vaccine [17] . Thus, unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated young infants are highly susceptible to pertussis. In the index study, the majority of the pertussis-positive infants were unvaccinated or had received only one dose of acellular pertussis vaccine. None of the infants had completed the primary pertussis vaccination series. This may explain the high prevalence of B. pertussis in the present study group. Moreover, the prevalence of pertussis was higher in infants who had been unvaccinated (31.1%) or who had received only one dose vaccine (28.8%) than those who had received two doses of the vaccine (13%). Pertussis is underdiagnosed, especially in young infants hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infection [5, 7, 9] . In fact, in the present study, pertussis was clinically suspected in only 16% of the infants with acute bronchiolitis, who proved to be B. pertussis positive by PCR. The present study also shows that the viral bronchiolitis and pertussis cases could not be separated by clinical or non-specific laboratory findings. Some studies reported that infants who were pertussis-positive had paroxysmal cough and whooping cough episodes more often than infants who were pertussisnegative, which concluded that paroxysmal cough and whooping are important clinical signs for the diagnosis of pertussis [5, 10] . In the index study, however, most pertussis-positive infants presented no paroxysmal cough or whooping episodes. These findings suggest that the lack of paroxysmal cough or whooping cough is not sufficient enough to exclude the diagnosis of pertussis in young infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis, in agreement with several studies [7] [8] [9] 14] . Also, the typical features of viral bronchiolitis, or even the detection of respiratory viruses such as RSV, do not rule out pertussis [5, 9, 10] . For example, wheezing did not distinguish viral bronchiolitis and pertussis [7] . In the present study, wheezing was presented in only half of infants in whom RSV and/or other respiratory viral agents were detected, whereas similarly nearly half of the pertussispositive infants wheezed.",

Coinfection of B. pertussis with RSV was described to cause severe infections in 2 studies from the United States and Japan [18, 19] . However, newer studies by Greenberg et al. [5] and Crowcroft et al. [10] revealed that co-infection of pertussis and RSV did not adversely affect the outcome in patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with various lower respiratory tract infections including acute bronchiolitis. Nuolivirta et al. [8] also suggests that there were no significant differences between B. pertussis positive and negative cases in the severity of the disease. A recent retrospective study from Israel by Abu Raya et al. [4] reported that young infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis in whom B. pertussis was detected had a milder disease severity at admission and during hospitalization than those in whom B. pertussis was not detected [4] . However, in the present prospective study which utilized the same disease severity scores with Abu Raya study, authors found that there were no significant differences in the severity scores at admission and during hospitalization for those with only viral infection compared with B. pertussis co-infection, and it is concluded that co-infection with pertussis did not affect the clinical outcome in infants hospitalized with acute bronchiolitis, which is in agreement with several other studies [5, 8, 10] . Nevertheless, early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of pertussis is important because it is effective in eradicating B. pertussis from the nasopharynx, thus reducing the risk of transmission [20] . Otherwise, a missed diagnosis in pediatric wards or the pediatric intensive care units may lead to pertussis outbreaks among vulnerable young infants.",
