The sequence (2834 nucleotides) which encompassed ORFs 3 to 7 revealed extensive genomic variations between the Qutbec strain and Lelystad virus (LV), resulting from high number of base substitutions, additions and deletions. The ORFs 5, 3, and 7 seemed to be relatively the most variable; the predicted encoding products of the Qutbec and LV strains displayed only 52%, 54%, and 59% amino acid identities, respectively. Nevertheless, in vitro translation experiments of the structural genes (ORFs 5, 6, and 7) and radioimmunoprecipitation assays with extracellular virions gave results similar to those previously reported for LV. In contrast, close genomic relationships were demonstrated between Qutbec and US strains. Taking together, these results indicate that, although structurally similar, North American PRRSV strains belong to a genotype distinct from that of the LV, thus supporting previous findings that allowed to divide PRRSV isolates into two antigenic subgroups (U.S. and European).",

The viral genome is a positive single-stranded polyadenylated RNA molecule of about 15 kb in length that contains eight open reading frames (ORFs) similarly organized as EAV [6, 8, 21] . The transcription mechanism of the genomic RNA has similarities with that of Coronaviruses, since a 3'-coterminal nested set of six major subgenomic mRNAs has been identified in PRRSV-infected cells [6, 20--22] . The virions contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated membrane protein of 25 kDa (E); it was recently shown that these proteins are encoded by ORFs 7, 6, and 5, respectively [23] .",

Although the clinical syndromes associated with PRRSV infection are similar in North America and Europe [12] , antigenic variations have been reported between US and European isolates and among US isolates [12, 25] . Preliminary sequence analysis of North American isolates revealed high genomic variations with European strains [18, 19] . This is strongly supported by serological findings. To further contribute to the understanding of the genetic basis for antigenic diversity between PRRSV isolates, we determined the cDNA sequence of the 3'-terminal genomic region of the Qurbec reference strain IAF-exp91. Our prime objective was to compare the genomic sequence o f the Qurbec strain to those of other reference strains from Europe and US. Since important amino acid changes were identified between North American strains and LV, we also analysed the proteins specified by a cell culture-adapted Qurbec PRRSV isolate (IAF-Klop) and demonstrated that these viruses remain structurally similar.",

Furthermore, when in vitro translation was carried out in the presence of canine microsomal membranes, a larger protein which migrated approximately to the same distance as the 24.5 K viral protein was observed (Fig. 4, tane 3) . -methionine or translation reaction products of ORF 7, ORF 6, and ORF 5 were incubated with the homologous porcine hyperimrnune serum. Antigen-antibody complexes were analysed by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel as shown in 2, 3, 6, and 8, respectively. A normal serum collected from a seronegative SPF pig was used as control for precipitation of ORFs 7, 6, and 5 (4, 7, and 9, respectively). The ORF 7 translation product was also immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody SDOWl 7 (5) directed against the 15 K protein of the American reference strain ATCC VR 2332 of PRRSV.

            "text": "In the present study, important genomic variations were demonstrated between a Qu6bec reference strain of P R R S V and LV, the European prototype virus. Since these viruses have a distinct geographic origin, and the fact that the Qu6bec strain seemed to have circulated several years before its initial isolation [7] , genomic heterogeneity a m o n g t h e m was expected. The data obtained from this genomic comparison are in agreement with previous findings by others who demonstrated the existence of antigenic and genomic variations between European and US P R R S V strains, the latters being more heterogeneous [20, 25, 32] . Genomic analyses of the Qu6bec reference strain further substantiate previous findings suggesting that North American and European PRRSV isolates may have diverged into two distinct genotypes [18, 20] . A common feature in the sequences of European PRRSV isolates is the absence of 22 nucleotides in the first half of the 3 '-terminal non-coding region, in comparison with North American isolates studied [18, 20, 30] . It remains to be seen, as more sequence data will be available, whether this property could be considered as a marker trait between European and North American PRRSV isolates. Biological and molecular similarities between LV, LDV, and EAV, have been well documented [2, 6, 10, 21, 26] , with LV and LDV being much more related to each other than to EAV. Despite its high genomic divergence with LV, the Qu6bec PRRSV strain also appeared to be more closely related to LDV than to EAV. The relatedness between PRRSV and LDV in several aspects is intriguing. Indeed, since the latter has been identified many years ago, one can easily speculate that PRRSV may have been derived from LDV. So far, there is no data which suggests an eventual replication of LDV in pigs or PRRSV in mice [13] . Phylogenetic analyses of the polymerase genes ofcoronaviruses, toroviruses, EAV,LDV, and LV, indicated that both LV and LDV may have derived from an EAV-like progenitor, while coronaviruses hypothetically arose from a torovirus progenitor [10] . Genetic recombinations between positive-stranded RNA viruses have been well demonstrated [11, 29] . A copy-choice mechanism, due to a polymerase \"jump\" from one negativesense R N A template to another, has been proposed for the generation of recombinant coronaviruses [16] . Whether such a mechanism has accounted in the emergence of PRRSV from LDV or from an arterivirus common ancestor, remains questionable. Recently, genomic variations have been also identified within the N and the M genes of several geographically distinct EAV isolates [3, 24] . Despite the distinction of three genomic variants among various EAV strains, their M and N proteins appeared to remain relatively unchanged, which is in agreement with the fact that no distinct antigenic variants of EAV has been identified so far. This contrasts with PRRSV, since the genomic differences between European and North American strains are considerable, and thus, tends to be more heterogeneous.",

The viral structural proteins were shown to be encoded by ORFs 7, 6, and 5, respectively [23] . A comparable protein profile was obtained for the cell culture-adapted Qu6bec IAF-Klop strain, suggesting that although genomically highly divergent, PRRSV isolates are structurally related. Indeed, despite high degrees of aa variations, in vitro translation experiments demonstrated that the primary structure of the ORFs 5 to 7 of the Qu6bec strain remains comparable to that of LV [23] . However, the difference observed in the electrophoretic mobility of the ORF 5 translated product of the Qu6bec strain (18.5 K) with that predicted from the aa sequence (22.4 K) is causing some concerns. Moreover, a 16.5 K protein species was obtained following glycoF treatment of viral proteins, rather than the 19 K protein predicted from the ORF 5 aa sequence after removal of the putative signal peptide. Studies using monospecific antisera should permit to elucidate whether the 16.5 K protein species could represent the primary unglycosylated form of the 24.5 K protein species. Such discrepancy in the size of the ORF 5 product predicted from the aa sequence, and the Mr value estimated from the electrophoretic mobility of the its in vitro translation product, has also been reported in case of LV [23] . A 16.5 K unglycosylated protein was also obtained after glycoF treatment of viral proteins precipitated from lysates of infected cells where the duration of the labeling period was only six hours (data not shown). Therefore, protein degradation could not be considered as an explanation for the discrepancies observed between the in vivo and in vitro molecular weights of the ORF 5 product. An interesting finding that has never been reported before, is the identification of two additional viral specific proteins in lysates of IAF-Klop infected MARC-145 cells. Two bands corresponding to proteins with apparent Mr s of 29 K and 42 K were constantly immunoprecipitated by the homologous porcine hyperimmune serum. Since these proteins were not detected with concentrated preparations of extracellular virions, they were considered as non-structural. In contrast, in case of LV, two proteins with apparently identical M~ s have been reported by western immunoblotting analysis using purified virion preparations, but both proteins could not be immunoprecipitated from lysates of LV-infected cells [23] . Based on the reactivity of anti-peptide sera directed against LV ORFs 5 and 7, it was speculated that the 42 K protein might represent a homo-or heterodimer of the E protein (25 kDa), whereas the 28 K species a dimeric form of the N protein (15 kDa) [23] . It remains to be demonstrated whether these products are distinct in cases of the LV and IAF-Klop strains, or whether the antiserum directed against the Qu6bec strain has a distinct specificity pattern from that used for LV.",

ST-..SQGAS Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the 3'-terminal genes (ORFs 3 to 7) of Qu6bec PRRSV strain IAF-exp91 with LV and corresponding available sequences from two American isolates (ATCC VR 2385, and MN-lb). The analysis was performed with the aid of the GeneWorks 2.2 (IntelliGenetics) program using default settings. Dots indicate residues identical to those of IAF-exp91, dashes represent gaps introduced into the sequences and amino acid changes are noted. The LV sequences used in this alignment are based on the sequence data presented by Meulenberg et al. [21]. Sequence data of the two US strains, ATCC VR 2385 and MN-1 b, were taken from previous reports of Meng et al. [20] and Kwang et al. [15], respectively",

Cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer, clarified, and immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal serum raised against the PRRSV strain IAF-exp91 (2) or the porcine homologous hyperimmune serum (3). As negative control, the porcine serum was tested with cell lysates from mock-infected cells(1). The molecular size (in kilodaltons) of the five major viral polypeptides is indicated on the right. B RIPA profiles of extracellular virions of the PRRSV strain IAF-Klop collected from supernatants of [35S]methionine-labeled MARC-145 cells after maximum cytopathic effect was achieved. The homologous porcine hyperimmune serum was used for precipitation of viral structural proteins after treatment(3) or no treatment with glyco F (2). Positions of molecular size markers (1) are shown on the left and the viral structural proteins are indicated by their molecular mass (in kilodaltons) on the right. The arrow indicates the possible unglycosylated form of the 24.5 K protein, regularly observed after glyco F treatment. The slight displacement of the treated 15 K and 19 K proteins as compared to their untreated counterparts (3 vs 2) should not be interpreted as resulting from deglycosylation of these proteins but is due to the enzyme incubation buffer as demonstrated in other experiments (data not shown)",
