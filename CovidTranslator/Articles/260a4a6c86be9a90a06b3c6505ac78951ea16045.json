From January 2001 to June 2006 the clinical characteristics and outcome of 177 consecutive patients with MRSA bacteraemia visiting an ED of a university hospital were studied. The average age of the patients was 65.8 years. Healthcareassociated MRSA bacteraemia comprised 76.3% of all cases. Catheter-related bacteraemia was the most common type of infection (22.6%), followed by soft tissue infection (20.9%) and primary bacteraemia (15.3%). Different types of infection were significantly related to different outcome. In-hospital mortality was 33.3%, but the mortality decreased to 17.7% when patients with rapidly fatal disease and mortality within 3 days were excluded. All isolates exhibited lower susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 1-2 g/mL). Factors associated with mortality included severity of underlying illness, severity of bacteraemia and persistent bacteraemia. A detrimental effect of elevated MIC could not be demonstrated despite applying several definitions of patient outcome. Patients admitted to the ED with MRSA bacteraemia carry high overall mortality; however, the severity of underlying illness, severity of bacteraemia and persistent bacteraemia are correlated with mortality, but not vancomycin MICs (2 g/mL) of MRSA isolates.",

In Taiwan, the prevalence of MRSA amongst nosocomial staphylococcal infections was ca. 60% [6] , and MRSA is an emerging community-acquired pathogen [7] . In our previous study of patients at the ED with MRSA bacteraemia, patients with true community MRSA bacteraemia were rarely seen [5] ; however, in recent years the number of these patients has been increasing at our hospital [8] . Concern about MRSA bacteraemia is due to its poor response to glycopeptide treat-ment [9, 10] , and many factors are reported to be closely associated with poor response, including severity of illness [10] , type of infection [11] , persistence of bacteraemia [12] and, notably, increased minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of MRSA isolates [13, 14] .",

Thus, we are interested in the outcome of patients with MRSA bacteraemia treated at the ED. Despite some studies suggesting that blood cultures ordered in the adult ED are rarely clinically useful [15, 16] , MRSA bacteraemia detected at the ED would usually change the antimicrobial agent at our hospital, where empirical glycopeptide use is not recommended [17] . Moreover, bacteraemia recovered at the ED is usually less complicated compared with nosocomial bacteraemia [18] . However, these patients might not receive complete examinations if rapid mortality occurs. With increasing MRSA bacteraemia aris-ing from the community [4, 8] , we describe the results of our observational study of MRSA bacteraemia at a university hospital ED, focusing on the risk factors for poor patient outcome.",

In this study, we focused on patients with MRSA bacteraemia recovered at the ED and demonstrated the characteristics and outcome of these patients. The outcome of our patients was more closely associated with the severity of underlying illness and bacteraemia, age and persistent bacteraemia. Despite recent studies suggesting that increased MICs of MRSA isolates have a detrimental effect on patient outcome [13, 14] , this is not supported in the current study. The in-hospital mortality was 33.6% and 32.5% amongst patients with MRSA isolates with a vancomycin MIC of 1 g/mL and 2 g/mL, respectively. Many factors complicate the evaluation of treatment response in patients with MRSA bacteraemia. One of the most important factors is the wide variation in the severity of underlying illness. Patients with rapidly fatal disease carry the highest mortality rates from bacteraemia episodes, which reached 84.6% in this study and 76.2% in a previous one [17] . Inclusion of these patients in survival analyses will confound the search for important prognostic factors. A recent study also found that underlying illness was the most important predictor of 7-day mortality in patients with S. aureus bacteraemia [27] .",

            "text": "In summary, this study of patients with MRSA bacteraemia treated at an ED found no effect of increased vancomycin MICs of isolates on patient outcome. In patients who had MRSA isolates with relatively high vancomycin MICs, the outcome was more closely associated with the severity of underlying illness and bacteraemia, age and persistent bacteraemia. Whether empirical vancomycin therapy or new anti-MRSA agents will improve the outcome of these patients deserves further research.",
