Because murine coronaviruses induce an MS-like disease, the human coronaviruses (HCoV) are attractive candidates as environmental factors involved in a demyelinating pathology. We previously reported the isolation of HCoV-229E/myelin basic protein (MBP) cross-reactive Tcell lines (TCL) in MS patients. To investigate antigenic cross-reactivity at the molecular level, 155 long-term T-cell clones (TCC) were derived from 32 MS patients by in vitro selection with MBP, proteolipid protein (PLP) or HCoV (strains 229E and OC43). Overall, 114 TCC were virus-specific, 31 were specific for myelin Ag and 10 other were HCoV/myelin cross-reactive. Twenty-eight virus-specific TCC and 7 myelin-specific TCC were obtained from six healthy donors. RACE RT-PCR amplification of the V\u03b2 chains of five of ten the cross-reactive TCC confirmed clonality and sequencing identified the CDR3 region associated with cross-reactivity. Our findings have promising implications in the investigation of the role of molecular mimicry between coronaviruses and myelin in MS as a mechanism related to disease initiation or relapses. ava i l a b l e a t w w w. s c i e n c e d i r e c t . c o m w w w. e l s ev i e r. c o m / l o c a t e / yc l i m Clinical Immunology (2007) 123, 258-267",

Even though no microbial agent has consistently been isolated from the tissue of patients, viral infection of the CNS can trigger autoimmune response [5] . Furthermore, exposure to infectious pathogens prior to puberty appears to increase the risk of developing MS, and respiratory tract infections often precede disease exacerbations [6, 7] . Several infectious agents have been associated with MS but the direct implication of a viral agent has never been confirmed. By leading to T-cell activation, viruses could act in MS initiation or progression, although immunopathology could occur much later after disease onset [8] as strongly suggested in a model using SJL/J mice, where it is believed that virus infections can prime animals for the development of CNS autoimmunity that may appear long after the infection has been cleared [9] . Therefore, clinical associations between viral infections and the triggering or exacerbation of MS remain difficult to prove and poorly understood. A very good model for the study of viral etiological agents potentially associated with autoimmune neurological diseases is the Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) infection of the CNS, which triggers a neurological disease similar to MS in genetically susceptible rodents [10] . Furthermore, Human Coronaviruses (HCoV), which are responsible for up to one third of common colds [11] , are also neuroinvasive [12, 13] and neurotropic [14] [15] [16] , enhancing the potential relevance of their association with neuropathologies such as MS [15] . We therefore investigated HCoV as one possible etiological agent of MS. Pro-inflammatory CD4 (+) Th1-helper cells reactive to myelin Ag are considered one of the key players in the induction and perpetuation of MS [17] . The primary activation or reactivation of autoreactive T cells has been explained in various ways: (1) Ag-independent activation of mature CD4 (+) T cells induced by dendritic cells that could shape the cytokine milieu, favoring autoimmune states such as MS [18] , (2) superantigen binding to given TCRV\u03b2 families and activating non-specific family restricted T-cell proliferations [19] , (3) epitope spreading associated with collateral inflammation and bystander activation resulting in the release of autoantigens [20] and (4) shared determinants between microbes and self-peptides, also known as molecular mimicry [21] . For neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses such as HCoV, molecular mimicry provides an elegant framework to explain how cross-reactivity between foreign-Ag and self-proteins may trigger or perpetuate autoimmune diseases on the basis of an appropriate genetic background, Ag presentation and TCR repertoire, as well as earlier microbial encounters [22] . Moreover, sequence homologies between foreign (viral) and self-proteins are not essential for molecular mimicry to be relevant, as it was shown with combinatorial peptides libraries [23] .",

Moreover, T-cell-associated myelin destruction can be observed in association with T-cell activation and inflammation in MS [29] and the myelin-related Ag MBP and PLP were shown to activate T-cell lines in MS patients [30] . Furthermore, our previous work showed that 29% of the peripheral T-cell lines (TCL) derived from 10 out of 16 MS patients and only 1.3%, from 2 out of 14 controls donors, were activated by both HCoV and myelin Ag (p b 0.001) [30] . Therefore, it appeared essential to characterize cross-reactivity at the clonal and molecular level. Therefore, our long-term goal aims at confirming the clonal origin of the antigenic cross-reactivity between the myelin antigens MBP and PLP and the common cold agents HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, commonly found in the population [11] . Herein, we show that TCC derived from the blood of MS patients can be activated by either viral or myelin Ag and sometimes by both. Cross-reactive TCR were cloned and sequenced to identify the hypervariable CDR3 regions characterizing TCR recognition and establishing clonality. Our results strengthen the hypothesis of a possible coronavirus-induced activation of T-cell autoimmunity by molecular mimicry in MS patients and also provide a framework to explain MS relapses.",

Cell growth was monitored and was characterized by round and clear blasts forming a tight colony. Wells exhibiting no cellular expansion revealed a layer of adherent APC with visible cytoplasmic structures covering most of the well surface.

Donors were between 28 and 69 years old with a median age of 43.9 for women and 58 for men. Referring to their medical files, none of them was treated with immunomodulating drugs at least 2 months prior to their enrollment in the study. T-cell lines (TCL) were generated with each selecting Ag and then cloned by limiting dilution. Table 1 indicates the total number of clones (TCC) obtained from the TCL and shows the global distribution of 145 monospecific TCC generated from MS patients and 35 TCC produced from healthy donors. No TCC responded to the control Ag tetanus toxoid. From 145 clones generated from the MS patients, 114 responded to coronaviral Ag and 31 recognized either MBP or PLP, the two myelin Ag tested. The protocol was designed to generate long-term CD4+ TCC, since the presentation was achieved with a purified protein or a pool of proteins presented by irradiated APC. A random sample of 28 TCC were tested by RT-PCR and were all CD4 + (data not shown). Only the monospecific Ag-specific TCC coming from 22 patients from whom we could generate longterm TCC (4 antigenic stimulations), are listed in Table 2 . Samples from the 22 out of 32 patients appearing in this list did allow for the production of long-term TCC of determined antigenic specificity. Fig. 1 illustrates typical proliferation profiles in cpm and stimulation index (S.I.) obtained with highly proliferating TCC established from MS patients by selection with either HCoV or myelin Ag. CPM values observed during the course of the study are stated with each selecting Ag following proliferation assays. Values seem to indicate that no specific patterns of proliferation could be established for any given Ag, as some TCC exhibited high proliferation and others yielded lower tritiated-thymidine intakes. The autoantigens (MBP and PLP) generally led to lower proliferation counts when compared to viral Ag. Those results were obtained after the fourth antigenic stimulation, with the corresponding selecting Ag. The coronavirus Ag led to a higher absolute measure of thymidine intake as measures went beyond 7000 cpm. However, the S.I. of all those TCC was high and constant throughout the four antigenic stimulations, for a period of about two months. Only those TCC that reached the fourth antigenic stimulation are included in the overall total of TCC produced during this experiment. The first antigenic stimulation established TCL and the second corresponded to cloning by limiting dilution. The third and fourth antigenic restimulations with selecting Ag were mostly expansion phases of Ag-specific TCC cultures. From an overall 229 TCC growing after the third stimulation, only 145 clones survived until the fourth stimulation, as there was a great variability in between patients regarding TCC production. Table 3 shows the distribution of the 145 longterm monospecific and 10 cross-reactive TCC obtained. Out of the 145 TCC, 114 clones responded to coronaviral Ag, 80 responding to 229E Ag and 34 to OC43 Ag, while 31 TCC recognized myelin Ag, as 19 TCC were selected with MBP, and 12 with PLP. In addition to these 145 monospecific TCC, 10 cross-reactive clones were obtained from 6 MS patients out of 32. Indeed, while some patients did not even lead to the production of monospecific TCC, some others generated several cross-reactive TCC. Table 4 describes Ag specificities for 10 coronavirus-myelin cross-reactive TCC. CNS myelin Ag was tested in addition to coronaviral Ag for each HCoV-specific clones, and vice versa. All cross-reactive TCC remained specific to the selecting Ag while also responding to the heterologous Ag of interest. Clones that no longer recognized the selecting Ag while responding to a heterologous Ag were observed but eliminated from further investigation because they could represent a non-clonal population. The most frequent occurrence of this phenomenon was with TCC that lost their reactivity to myelin Ag after being selected by PLP or MBP. Six out of ten TCC were selected with viral Ag (four by HCoV-229E and two by HCoV-OC43), but also proliferated when stimulated with myelin Ag. Interestingly, two TCC selected with either HCoV-OC43 or HCoV-229E recognized both MBP and PLP Ag. On the other hand, two TCC selected with PLP and two selected with MBP recognized 229E Ag (Table 4) . Therefore, it appeared that HCoV-229E and MBP were the two Ag predominantly involved in the crossreactivity. Among the 6 patients from whom we were able to generate cross-reactive TCC, four suffered from the chronic-progressive (CP) form of MS and two from the relapsing-remitting (RR) form and no relationship could be observed between MS severity for a given patient and coronavirus-myelin cross-reactive TCC. The patients from whom cross-reactive clones were derived were all HLA-typed and half of them (P8, P13, P22) were HLA-DR15 (Table 5) , which represents a genetic susceptibility factor associated with MS [1] .",

Our results confirmed coronaviral-myelin cross-reactivity at the single cell level, involving two major myelin Ag (MBP, PLP) and two HCoV serotypes. Overall, from 6 healthy donors and 32 MS patients, 145 monospecific TCC were activated by viral Ag while 35 TCC responded to myelin Ag. As autoreactive T cells are present in healthy individuals as well as in patients with autoimmune disorders [5] , detection of autoreactive cells (monospecific TCC) against myelin Ag in normal donor was not surprising. Moreover, 13 participants out of the 22 from whom we were able to get TCC, had the relapsing-remitting (RR) form of the pathology and 9 suffered from chronic-progressive (CP) MS, but no association with specific cell proliferation profile was noted.",

Greater flexibility for antigenic restimulations was therefore achieved and experiments were independent of external elements like intake of medications and by possible fluctuating health of the patients, avoiding possible immune variations occurring between Ag restimulations. Furthermore, autologous APC adequately address the antigenic restriction necessary for presentation [33] , avoiding the introduction of further foreign elements in the culture, a key feature to consider when working with study participants exhibiting various haplotypes. Because it significantly increased the production of TCC, Ag-specific TCL were generated but the evaluation of in vivo frequencies of activated TCC was thus forbidden since lymphocytes were previously activated/selected in vitro. The nature of the Ag is determinant to generate TCC. Even though, it has been known for a long time that peptides provide the advantage of being potent antigenic stimulators, which can allow the identification of specific epitopes [34] , the use of complete proteins was chosen for our study as it increases the range of available epitopes and might favor the presentation of some conformations. Furthermore, it was shown that the use of peptides might not faithfully reproduce those generated by intracellular loading of peptides coming from the processing of native antigens [35] . Even though the S.I. was similar after stimulation with either coronavirus or myelin Ag (Fig. 1) , the coronaviral Ag was better activators of T cells as nearly 80% of the TCC were selected against viral Ag (Table 1) . Common seroposivity for coronavirus in the population [13] , may be linked to this result and one has to keep in mind that myelinreactive TCC have low in vivo frequency [36] . 229E  OC43  MBP  PLP  229E  OC43  MBP  PLP   80  34  19  12  4  2  2  2  MS  32  114  31  6  6  4 From the blood of 32 donors (n1), we generated 145 long-term primary TCC selected with either viral or myelin Ag and 10 HCoV-myelin crossreactive TCC were produced from the blood of 6 out of these 32 MS patients (n2).

            "text": "The presence of activated CD4+ Th1 T cells reactive against PLP in the CNS of mice that were immunized with a PLP-specific peptide that induced EAE, adds to the relevance of autoreactive T cells in the induction of autoimmune disease [37] . Furthermore, the relevance of an autoimmunologic T cell memory as a critical factor in chronic autoimmune disease is suggested by the lifelong persistence of encephalitogenic T cell clones in the rat CNS [38] and in the long-lasting persistence of autoimmune T-cell clones against MBP or PLP in human blood [39, 40] . Memory T cells have a lower threshold for activation: therefore, when they are activated during an immune response against high affinity foreign antigens, cross-reactive low-affinity selfligands may potentially reactivate an autoreactive T cell response [41] . Another interesting observation was that cross-reactive TCC selected with viral Ag could in some instances recognize both myelin Ag (clones P13b and P22b described in Table 5 ). This might underline the fact that autoreactive CD4+ T-cell Ag recognition is associated to the degenerate/flexible nature of the TCR essential for a good recognition of foreign antigen [42] . Holler and Kranz [43] previously proposed the \"conformer model\" as a possible means to explain T cell cross-reactivity and it was recently shown that cross-reactive TCR possess a molecular flexibility to accommodate structurally very diverse ligands [44] . Both types of cross-reactivity, the initial selecting Ag being either a viral or a myelin Ag, could have a potential pathological significance. Indeed, autoreactive T cells are present in healthy individuals but the autoimmune potential of these cells appears to be in good part controlled by regulatory T cells. However, those regulatory T cells have an impaired capacity in MS patients and autoreactive cells are more easily activated [5] . Furthermore, it was previously shown that CD4+ myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) autoreactive T cells isolated from MS patients had increased cytotoxic properties compared to those isolated from control subjects [45] . Therefore, even though our results do not demonstrate that the cross-reactive TCC obtained have a relevant implication in triggering or exacerbating disease, their presence in MS patients and not controls [30] makes it plausible that these cells play a direct or indirect role in inducing autoimmunity in vivo. With regard to potential pathological significance, a TCC selected with viral Ag could be activated in the periphery after a coronavirus infection, pass through the blood brain barrier and gain access to the CNS where it can damage myelin. Alternatively, a TCC selected with myelin Ag could be activated following myelin damage (resulting from a cytopathic infection or an injury) leading to the release of autoantigens. Subsequent corona-virus infections can then occur and enhance or maintain the induced autoimmunity and since coronavirus reinfections are possible, it could explain or at least be linked to MS relapses [11] . Cytotoxic T lymphocytes attracted to the CNS during a murine coronavirus (MHV) infection need the help of the CD4 + population to be effective in clearing the virus from the CNS [46] . Moreover, we have recently demonstrated that MBP-reactive T cells were activated following MHV-A59 infection of the CNS [47] . Therefore, such CD4+ cells may also be essential to clear neuroinvasive HCoV [12] from the CNS and could react against myelin epitopes being exposed in significant concentrations after damage resulting from inflammation brought about by virus-mediated activation of glial cells, cytokines and nitric oxide [48] . Moreover, the presence of coronaviruses within the CNS could increase the number of MHC molecules on cell surface [49] , which could also participate in the possible establishment of an autoimmune state. Cross-reactivity between self and other viral antigens was recently reported. Indeed, cross-reactivity between Human Herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and MBP [50] and a high level of cross-reactivity between myelin-derived peptide and Influenza HA for one specific CD4+ TCC [51] were recently reported and represent other examples of potential virus-induced molecular mimicry.",

            "text": "Further evidence is needed to confirm that such examples can really be explained by molecular mimicry and represent a relevant explanation to link infection and human neurological diseases like MS. Because of the degeneracy in the Tcell repertoire, cross-reactive activation of autoreactive T cells must be tightly regulated. Therefore, molecular mimicry-related activation of autoreactive T cells following an infection would require that the infectious agent encode a mimic epitope that can be processed from its native protein. Moreover, the pathogen should be able to induce the innate immune system in order to start the process of clonal expansion of the potentially pathologic cross-reactive T cells and it may be essential that an inflammation process occur in the target organ to initiate or maintain the putative autoimmune reaction [52] . A model of autoimmune disease resembling MS was induced using recombinant Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) expressing a mimic peptide related to PLP. A recent report describing the use of this virus and the initiation and exacerbation of the disease [53] , showed that all the above requirements were necessary in order to produce the disease and demonstrated that virusinduced molecular mimicry was indeed a viable explanation for the onset of demyelinating diseases like MS. Furthermore, infections are often temporally associated with relapses in MS and these relapses lead to a more sustained neurological deficit than non-infection-associated relapses [54] . Even though there is still no convincing evidence for a role of specific viral agent in the initiation or maintenance of a disease like MS, viruses have been major players in the search for the cause of multiple sclerosis and common ones causing upper respiratory tract infection are often associated with MS relapses [7, 8] .",

Analysis of the crystal structure of each MHC-peptide complex revealed a strong degree of structural equivalence, providing structural evidence for molecular mimicry involving HLA molecules [55] . The HLA-DRB1*1501 haplotype, which appears to present an immunodominant MBP peptide [56] , represents a genetic factor increasing the susceptibility to develop MS and it is known that several in vitro T-cell clones (TCC) generated from MS patients, were also activated with viral and bacterial peptides that contain the predicted motifs for binding to HLA-DRB1*1501 [22] . Moreover, a recent report using humanized transgenic mice models overexpressing HLA-DR15 coupled to a peptide coming from either MBP, myelin oligodendrocytes glycoprotein (MOG) or \u03b1B-crystallin [57] and MSderived TCR specific for HLA-DR15, described spontaneous demyelinating disease strongly resembling MS. Therefore, our HLA-typing results (Table 5 ) are in concordance with the literature.",

The high proportion of the TCR chain V\u03b26 observed in our study is consistent with the literature, which indicates that V\u03b26*5 is over expressed in MS patients [60] . It is believed that the CDR2 portion of that particular beta chain could favor interactions involving autoimmune peptides or autoreactive lymphocytes [61] . Interestingly, V\u03b28*2, which was identified in one of our TCC, was also associated to autoreactive myelin TCC [62] . The associations between certain V\u03b2 families and cross-reactivity in MS patients are interesting in the exploration of possible new genetic-related patterns that might lead to pathogenesis, as it is strongly suggested for HLA-DRB1*1501. Furthermore, as the hypervariable portion of cross-reactive TCR was identified, it may be interesting to see whether the hypervariable (CDR3) sequence of the crossreactive clones could be used as a molecular probe in the CNS. Future investigations are required to examine TCR-peptide interaction and to pinpoint the epitopes involved in the crossrecognition we observe. However, even though our results from sequencing and diversity-PCR demonstrate the clonality of the cross-reactive T cells isolated from MS patients, the possibility that some of these cells bear two TCR remains. Indeed, even though it remains uncertain whether both TCR with a different \u03b1 chain are always functional on dual receptor T cells, these TCR do exist and this type of T cell may represent up to 30% of the normal repertoire in human and mouse [63] . Furthermore, at least two important reports have shown that these dual receptor Tcells could express two fully functional TCR with different \u03b1 chain [64, 65] . Therefore, dual recognition of antigens by the same TCC could involve either the same TCR recognizing both viral and self antigen on the same HLA haplotype, or two different TCR (with two different \u03b1 chains on the same TCC) interacting with two different HLA-DR molecules on the APC. Nevertheless, the fact that three out of five cross-reactive TCC were derived from patients homologous in their DR haplotype does strongly suggest recognition of the same HLA-DR molecule by the TCC. Further studies could involve overlapping peptides and purified/fractionated viral proteins to assess the fine specificity of the TCC isolated in our study. TCR gene reconstitution in fast growing T-cell hybridomas [66] could allow further analysis and interpretations of the identified sequences through peptide affinity investigations and confirm whether all the tested TCC possessed only one TCR.",

Furthermore, it will be interesting to look for this coronaviral-myelin cross-reactivity in other neurological pathologies where inflammation is also a key player. As coronaviral reinfections are possible, the neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties of the HCoV may explain the initiation or the exacerbation of symptoms in various other neuropathologies. In conclusion, our results concerning the cross-reactivity are consistent with molecular mimicry and suggest that such a mechanism could occur and be relevant in MS patients.
