Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. Cultured cells, eggs and laboratory animals are the most common methods for virus isolation. However, although eggs and laboratory animals are very useful for the isolation of certain viruses, cell cultures are the main system for virus isolation. Although molecular methods have become more widely used in the field of virus detection, cell culture remains the golden standard for viral isolation. Different cell lines vary greatly in their susceptibility to different viruses. It is of utmost importance that the most sensitive cell cultures are used for isolating a particular suspected virus. When the pathogen is unknown, the traditional approach is to inoculate the specimen into several different types of cell cultures until CPE is observed (6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18). The success of viral isolation is very much dependent on the experience of the researcher, and",

In comparison to the direct mixed-culture method, our system, in which the different cells were cultured in isolation, has several advantages. First, if CPE is detected after infection with an unknown pathogen, the knowledge of which cell line is permissive to the viral infection can aid identification of the virus, minimizing the number offurther experiments required to narrow things down. Second, the CPEs shown in our co-cultured system were similar to the CPEs in the individual cultured cells, while that of the mixed cell culture could be different. Immunofluorescence is widely used for the rapid diagnosis of virus infections by the detection of virus antigen in specimens, as well as the detection of virus-specific antibody",
