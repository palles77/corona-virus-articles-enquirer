            "text": "Objective: To identify differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CD4 \u00fe T cells triggered upon latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Methods: Expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4 \u00fe T cells from individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI), active TB and healthy controls were analyzed by microarray assay and four lncRNAs were selected for validation using real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway based approaches were used to investigate biological functions and signaling pathways affected by the differentially expressed mRNAs. Results: LncRNAs and mRNAs in CD4 \u00fe T cells were involved in LTBI and active TB disease. Compared with healthy controls, 449 lncRNAs and 461 mRNAs were deregulated in LTBI group, 1,113 lncRNAs and 1,490 mRNAs were deregulated in active TB group, as well as 163 lncRNAs and 187 mRNAs were differentially expressed in both LTBI and active TB group. It was worth noting that 41 lncRNAs and 60 mRNAs were deregulated between three groups. Most deregulated lncRNAs were from intergenic regions (w50%), natural antisense to protein-coding loci (w20%), or intronic antisense to protein-coding loci (w10%). Significantly enriched signaling pathways based on deregulated mRNAs were mainly involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, cytokineecytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, etc. Journal of Infection (2014) 69, 558e568 Conclusions: The study was the first report of differentially expressed lncRNAs in CD4 \u00fe T cells response to TB infection and indicated that some lncRNAs may be involved in regulating host immune response to TB infection. Future studies are needed to further elucidate potential roles of these deregulated lncRNAs in LTBI and its reactivation.",

Overall, without treatment, about 10% of individuals with LTBI will develop active TB disease at some time in their lives. 2, 3 However, the underlying mechanisms of LTBI and its reactivation remain largely unknown.

Noncoding RNAs play an important role in modulating gene transcription. 7 Based on their length, noncoding RNAs are divided into 2 major classes: short (<200 nucleotides) and long (>200 nucleotides). 8 MicroRNAs are a large group of short noncoding RNA and their roles have been relatively well studied in human biology and disease. 9 In contrast to micro-RNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are much less known concerning their functions. Recent evidence indicates that lncRNAs play important roles in many physiological and pathological processes, such as cell differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation and cancer. 10e12 However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in TB disease.",

The primers used in the study (their sequences were available if necessary) were designed by optimization of parameters including melting temperature, GC content, complementarity, and secondary structure as well as primer length. No template control (containing all the reagents except template) was run to reduce the possible cross contamination from reagents as well as surfaces and no amplification control (including all the reagents other than reverse transcriptase) was used to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endogenous control.

Role of lncRNAs in TB infection was just beginning to be explored and it was difficult to synthesize our results to reach a definitive conclusion based on this single study. As only 4 samples from each group were extensively evaluated, future studies are necessary to replicate, expand these findings in more patient samples. Moreover, further investigation of lncRNA roles may help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of LTBI and its reactivation.",
