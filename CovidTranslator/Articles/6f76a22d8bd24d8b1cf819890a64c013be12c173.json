            "text": "The etiology of most neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system remains unknown and likely involves a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggering factors. Given that exposure to numerous infectious pathogens occurs during childhood, and that some viral infections can lead to neurodegeneration and demyelination, it is conceivable that some viruses may act as triggering factors in neuropathogenesis. We have previously shown that the prototype OC43 strain of the common cold-associated human respiratory coronavirus has the capacity to infect human neuronal and glial cells and does persist in human brains. Moreover, it has neuroinvasive properties in susceptible BALB/c mice, where it leads to a chronic encephalitis with accompanying disabilities. Here, we show that mutations in the viral spike glycoprotein, reproducibly acquired during viral persistence in human neural cell cultures, led to a drastically modified virus-induced neuropathology in BALB/c mice, characterized by flaccid paralysis and demyelination. Even though infection by both mutated and wild-type viruses led to neuroinflammation, the modified neuropathogenesis induced by the mutated virus was associated with increased viral spread and significantly more CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system, as well as significantly increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 and the chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1). Moreover, recombinant virus harboring the S glycoprotein mutations retained its neurotropism, productively infecting neurons. Therefore, interaction of a human respiratory coronavirus with the central nervous system may modulate virus and host factors resulting in a modified neuropathogenesis in genetically susceptible individuals.

Indeed, we have reported that HCoV can infect and persist in human neural cells (Arbour et al, 1999a (Arbour et al, , 1999b Bonavia et al, 1997) , can activate human glial cells to produce proinflammatory mediators (Edwards et al, 2000) , and persist in human brains (Arbour et al, 2000) .

BALB/c mice were infected by each recombinant virus and survival curves were established for mice infected with rOC/U S24-241 Paralysis caused by S-mutated human coronavirus first week post infection by rOC/ATCC, mice ate and drank normally and did not loose weight, compared to control mice (Figure 2A ). At around 9 days post infection (DPI), rOC/ATCC-infected mice started to present ruffled fur and a humped-back posture 2 to 3 days later ( Figure 2C ). Between 11 and 13 DPI, rOC/ ATCC-infected mice either recovered rapidly and showed no further symptoms of encephalitis or became inactive and started to die at 13 DPI ( Figure 2B ). This reproduces our earlier report using the original wild-type prototype virus strain (ATCC VR-759) (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) . On the other hand, mice infected with rOC/U S24-241 presented the first clinical signs of disease more rapidly than for rOC/ATCC, as they started to lose weight ( Figure 2A ) and die between 7 to 11 DPI ( Figure 2B ). During this period, mice showed loss of tonicity or paralysis of the tail. Moreover, abnormal locomotion was evident during the acute phase of rOC/ U S24-241 virus-initiated pathology. Starting at around 9 DPI, motor disabilities could already be observed ( Figure 2C , lower panel), as mice presented an abnormal paw position and loss of strength, indicative of neuropathology. Between 10 to 15 DPI, mice presented flaccid hindlimb paralysis. Survival rates were more than 3 times higher in rOC/ATCC-infected mice compared to rOC/U S24-241 . Indeed, 70% of mice survived to infection by rOC/ ATCC whereas only 20% survived to infection by rOC/U S24-241 ( Figure 2B ). Therefore, the introduction of four mutations in the viral spike glycoprotein was sufficient to confer drastically increased neurovirulence to HCoV-OC43.",

Both infectious recombinant viruses started to be quantifiable in mouse brain at 3 DPI and remained detectable during the first 2 weeks of infection as no more infectious paricles were detectable after 15 DPI ( Figure 3A ). For both viruses, the highest level of infectious virions were found between 7 to 9 DPI and 100% of mice were positive for infectious virus between 5 and 11 DPI, indicating that the two recombinant viruses replicated to similar extents in the brain ( Figure 3A ). On the other hand, infectious rOC/ U S24-241 virus appeared more rapidly in the spinal cord, illustrating the increased viral spread of this virus, compared to rOC/ATCC. Indeed, infectious rOC/U S24-241 virus was detectable in the spinal cord as early as 5 DPI and peaked at 7 DPI, whereas this was delayed by 2 days for rOC/ATCC ( Figure 3B ). Interestingly, the peak of infectious rOC/ ATCC particles was at least 10 times lower than for rOC/U S24-241 in the spinal cord.

As expected, CD4 + and CD8 + T-lymphocytes could not be detected in the brains of control (Sham) animals. However, mice infected by either recombinant virus demonstrated a robust CNS T-cell response ( Figure 7A ). Lymphocytes were detected in the CNS of both rOC-infected animals at 5 DPI and mononuclear cell infiltration increased between 9 and 13 DPI ( Figure 7B and C). The frequency of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells peaked at 13 DPI in brain following infection by both viruses. Furthermore, a major difference between the two recombinant viruses was observed at 9 DPI, where CD4 + T-cell infiltration was significantly higher following rOC/U S24-241 infection compared to rOC/ ATCC ( Figure 7B and C). Congruent with the kinetics of viral infection (Figure 3 ), CD4 + T-lymphocytes increased more rapidly in brains and spinal cords of rOC/U S24-241 -infected animals, reaching their maximal level at 9 DPI, as compared to 13 DPI for rOC/ ATCC-infected animals ( Figure 7B ). The increase in CD4 + T-cell infiltration in the CNS during infection suggests that these cells play an important role in virus clearance. Indeed, comparison between the CD4 + T-cell frequency ( Figure 7B ) and infectious virus titers ( Figure 4A ) revealed an abrupt decline in infectious virus, concomitant with an increasing frequency of CD4 + T-lymphocytes in the CNS. A more tenuous correlation was observed for CD8 + T cells following infection ( Figure 7C ).",

We targeted the spinal cord because viral replication at that site Paralysis caused by S-mutated human coronavirus H Jacomy et al was faster and reached higher levels in rOC/U S24-241than in rOC/ATCC-infected mice and rOC/U S24-241infected animals presented motor disabilities related to spinal cord dysfunction, such as paralysis.

Virus was found mainly in the hippocampi, more specifically in dentate gyrus (DG) and in the CA3 layer of the hippocampus (top arrow in upper panel). Patches of infected cells were seen in the cortical area (bottom arrow in upper panel). Higher magnification shows that neurons remained the main target of infection by both viruses.

Indeed, the rOC/U S24-241 virus was more virulent than wild-type rOC/ATCC virus, exhibiting a 3 to 4 log unit decrease in the intracerebral 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) in BALB/c mice to obtain the same survival rate (data not shown). As also reported for MHV (Phillips et al, 1999) , increased neurovirulence of rOC/U S24-241 was associated with accelerated spread throughout the CNS. However, unlike MHV, where demyelinating strains differ in their neural cell tropism as compared to nondemyelinating strains (Das Sarma et al, 2008) , the difference between the capacities of rOC/ATCC and rOC/ U S24-241 to induce paralysis and eventually demyelination was not associated by a fundamental change in their cellular tropism or the topography of the infection within the CNS. Indeed, neurons were always the target cell of both viruses during the acute phase of infection but only mice infected by We observed a mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS, which included CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, which was correlated with infectious virus clearance to below detectable levels. These results suggest that T cell-mediated adaptive immunity, in conjunction with innate immunity, represented mostly by astrocytes and macrophages/microglia (Figure 4) , both play a role in clearance of the two virus recombinants.",

These proinflammatory cytokines have been reported to induce neurotoxicity and could work in concert to synergically induce neuronal damage (Jeohn et al, 1998) , and could be involved in several neurodegenerative disorders (Block and Hong, 2005) . IL-1b plays a central role in neuronal injury (Allan et al, 2005) and it mediates both innate and adaptive immune responses directly or by the induction of other cytokines such as IL-6 or TNF-a (Mills and Dunne, 2009 ). Moreover, TNF-a and IL-1b are among the most important stimulators of IL-6 production by astrocytes and microglia (Gruol and Nelson, 1997) . Importantly, a robust rise in IL-6 and TNF-a, as what is observed after infection by rOC/U S24-241 , may be detrimental, since spontaneous inflammatory CNS demyelination was described in transgenic mice overexpressing TNF-a (Probert et al, 1997) , as well as in rats intrathecally infused with IL-6 (Kaplin et al, 2005) . Also, increased amounts of inflammatory molecules may induce a loss of blood-brain barrier integrity and Values represent means \u00b1 standard deviations (5 DPI: n = 3 for all groups of mice; 9 DPI: n = 3 for all groups of mice; 13 DPI: n = 2 for rOC/ATCC and n = 1 for rOC/U S24-241 ).

Activation of the innate immune response and neuronal injury in the CNS may be linked. In the present study, we report also neuronal damage in the spinal cord, as monitored by the presence of dephosphorylated neurofilaments during the acute phase of the infection by both recombinant viruses. However, neuronal vulnerability to damage following virus infection could differ between the two viruses. Indeed, the more neurovirulent virus, rOC/U S24-241 , infected the spinal cord more rapidly, where it produced up to 10 times more infectious particles than rOC/ATCC did. It has recently been shown that axonal transport of viral particles could represent a mechanism mediating the extent of axonal damage, and the subsequent induction of demyelination in the spinal cord (Das Sarma et al, 2009 ). This fact may render the axons less efficient in conducting the nerve influx, thereby affecting the motility of the hind limbs, as observed following infection by the rOC/U S24-241 virus, as the increased spread and replication of the rOC/U S24-241 virus may render axons unstable and more vulnerable to eventual cell death, as seen in other neuropathologies (Jackson et al, 2005) .",

Therefore, these results suggest that the motor dysfunction is possibly linked to the flaccid paralysis and to eventual development of limited demyelination (Figure 9 ), as seen after Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection (Tsunoda et al, 2003 (Tsunoda et al, , 2007 . However, as we were never able to detect any dephosphorylation of neurofilaments in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (mostly sensory neurons) in the early stages of disease, our results also suggest that the main demyelinating process (large plaques shown in Figure 9 present in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord) may be related to a different underlying mechanism. Neuronal damage induced by a viral infection, glial activation, and local inflammatory reactions could lead to disturbance of CNS homeostasis, a process that may lead to a modified pathology. Inflammatory demyelinating lesions were not detectable until 1 month post infection, suggesting that axonal damage and subsequent neuroinflammation could trigger myelin destruction, as demonstrated in early stages of experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) (Wang et al, 2005) . Activated resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages and T cells can produce chemokines and cytokines toxic to axons and/or myelin. Indeed, inflammatory responses, infection of neurons, and lack of axon-myelin interaction could eventually contribute to oligodendrocyte death and subsequent demyelination.",

Recombinant infectious wild-type viral particles (rOC/ATCC) were obtained after pBAC-OC43 FL transfection of BHK-21 cells and amplification by a single passage on the HRT-18 cell line used for routine virus propagation (St-Jean et al, 2006a) . The U-87MG astrocytic cells were infected because they represent human cells from the CNS, which, as already published (Arbour et al, 1999a) , are able to sustain a persistent HCoV-OC43 infection, therefore representing a good model to mimic a possible adaptation of the virus in human cells of the CNS. The four mutations D 24 Y, S 83 T, H 183 R, and Y 241 H, (located in the HCoV-OC43 putative cell receptor binding domain) were the only ones detected in the viral S gene after 35 passages of the persistently infected human U-87MG astrocytic cell line (St-Jean et al, 2006b) .

The suspension was centrifuged at 300 \u00c2 g for 10 min; the pellet was resuspended into 4 ml of 30% (v/v) Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and underlaid by a 70% (v/v) Percoll solution. The gradient was centrifuged (1000 \u00c2 g for 20 min without braking) and cells were collected from the interface and washed once with RPMI containing 5% (v/v) FBS. Isolated cells were stained in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS + 1% [w/v] bovine serum albumin [BSA]) for CD3-FITC (CD3-fluorescein isothiocyanate), CD4-PE (CD4-phycoerythrin), and CD8-PECy5 (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4 C in the dark, washed three times in FACS buffer, and fixed in 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde.
