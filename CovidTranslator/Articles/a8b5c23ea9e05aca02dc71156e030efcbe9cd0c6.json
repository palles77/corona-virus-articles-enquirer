Overall, recirculating HVAC filtration was predicted to achieve risk reductions at lower costs of operation than equivalent levels of outdoor air ventilation, particularly for MERV 13e16 filters. Medium efficiency filtration products (MERV 7e11) are also inexpensive to operate but appear less effective in reducing infectious disease risks.",

Communicable respiratory illnesses lead to large excesses in expenses associated with healthcare, absence from work, and lost worker productivity [1] , but the control of airborne infectious disease transmission in indoor environments is not yet entirely understood [2] . Several studies have shown that building design and operational characteristics such as increased outdoor air ventilation rates, lower occupant density, and use of UV germicidal irradiation can reduce the risk of infectious disease transmission inside buildings [3e7] . Similarly, commonly available particle filters in recirculating heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems may also be used to reduce the risk of airborne infectious disease transmission, depending on the nature of infectious aerosols and some important building characteristics [2,4,8e12] .",

Because of this assumption, the model cannot distinguish between long-range transport of smaller infectious aerosols (i.e., droplet nuclei) and close-contact airborne spread of infectious diseases that occurs when expelled infectious aerosols deposit directly on susceptible parts of the human body (i.e., large droplets). However, quanta generation rates are usually back calculated from scenarios where long-range transport was very likely a major factor. For example, Rudnick and Milton (2003) estimated quanta generation rates of 15e128 per hour for influenza (depending on steady-state or dynamic assumptions) using data from a grounded passenger airplane where the majority of passengers throughout the airplane acquired the influenza virus from one infected individual [23] . While the quanta generation rates in this case may have accounted for some close-range transport, it is reasonable to assume that many passengers would also have been infected by longer-range aerosol transport.",

Because the removal mechanisms of any aerosol (including HVAC filtration) are primarily functions of particle size [32, 33] , it is important to consider the actual particle size distributions of infectious aerosols in indoor environments for use with this model. Although the original Wells-Riley model does not explicitly account for the sizeresolved nature of infectious aerosols, modifications have been made by others to do so [4, 34, 35] . Therefore, the next sections describe previous efforts to integrate other size-dependent loss terms into the Wells-Riley equation and then review existing knowledge of particle size distributions of infectious aerosols to inform the modeling effort herein. Infectious particle size distributions are explored with the specific intent of generalizing for use with the particle size range relevant to a common HVAC filtration standard: ASHRAE Standard 52.2 [36] .",

Depending on the nature of the virus or bacteria of concern inside of expelled droplets or droplet nuclei, some rate of inactivation may also occur as aerosols are exposed to indoor air [34] . This rate has been explored for some viruses [38, 39] and is dependent in part on environmental conditions such as relative humidity. However, we have excluded this loss rate in this work in [20] part because of a lack of existing data on size-resolved inactivation rates for multiple infectious aerosols of concern and in part because quanta generation rates, when back calculated using Equation (1), should inherently account for any inactivation that occurred during the case study period. Additionally, although Equations 2 and 3 are shown without explicitly considering particle size effects, both the filtration and deposition loss parameters (k deposition and k filtration ) are size-dependent. Therefore, the following sections describe existing knowledge of the particle size distributions of infectious aerosols.",

Sampling locations within each environment included both stationary indoor measurements and personal measurements. Importantly, the variety of aerosol samplers used also varied in their particle size cut-off points. However, each study characterized Fortunately for this work, the size bins from the selected studies aligned relatively closely to the three size bins outlined in the most commonly used HVAC filtration standard in the U.S., ASHRAE Standard 52.2, which classifies filtration efficiency in bins of 0.3e 1 mm, 1e3 mm, and 3e10 mm [36] . Therefore, we adjusted each of the reported size distributions in Table 2 to fit within those three particle size ranges by assuming that the virus content has a uniform distribution in each particle size bin. These assumed distributions are shown in the rightmost columns in Table 2 . Although this assumption introduces some uncertainty, we have no way of directly quantifying the magnitude at this time.

Because there are multiple references for the distribution of influenza virus content in size-fractioned aerosols, we introduced an estimate of uncertainty by assuming the infectious particle size distributions from each environment in each referenced study were equally likely to be present in the modeled indoor environment. These distributions for each filter are shown in Table 4 , along with the mean infectious particle removal efficiency for each filter averaged across each study in Table 2 Mean filtration efficiency values for infectious droplet nuclei are estimated to range from 10.5% for MERV 4 filters to 99.9% for HEPA filters. Assumptions across the wide range of infectious particle size distributions summarized in Table 2 lead to infectious droplet nuclei removal efficiencies that vary by as much as 19% absolutely (although the range narrows for higher MERV filters because of high removal efficiencies for all particle size ranges).",

We estimated the cost of outdoor air delivery in the case study office environment for four different locations across the United States: Chicago, IL, Charlotte, NC, Houston, TX, and Phoenix, AZ. We assumed that a 90% efficient natural gas boiler or furnace was used for heating and the air-conditioning equipment had a constant electric coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.0 (or approximately SEER 12, which is in line with many relatively new existing commercial buildings [67] ). We assumed that the office building did not operate continuously year-round, but that it operated w31% of the time (i.e., 11 h per day from 7 am to 6 pm to accommodate staff members, excluding holidays and weekends). We used the defined operational schedule and hourly TMY3 (typical meteorological year) weather data to calculate HDDs and CDDs for each hour of assumed operation [68] . HDDs and CDDs were calculated using a base temperature of 18.3 C. Estimates of HDDs and CDDs utilized in the model are shown in Table 5 , along with estimated annual costs of supplying one unit of outdoor ventilation air in each climate. We assumed electricity rates were constant at $0.12/kWh and that natural gas rates were $8/MMBTU (1 MMBTU \u00bc 1055 MJ).

Labor costs were estimated directly from Bek\u00f6 et al. (2008) as $12 per filter installation and $5 per filter disposal. Assuming each filter is 24 00 \u00c2 24 00 (0.6 \u00c2 0.6 m), the number of filters required for the office environment was estimated by (i) dividing the airflow rate through the HVAC filter by an assumed constant 2 m/s face velocity, which yields the approximate area of filtration required, and (ii) determining the number of 24 00 \u00c2 24 00 (61 \u00c2 61 cm) filters to achieve that approximate area, rounding to the nearest whole number. This yielded one filter required in the hypothetical office environment. Annual labor costs were estimated by multiplying the labor cost of changing one filter ($12 \u00fe $5 \u00bc $17 per filter) by the estimated number of filter replacements during one year of operation. The initial costs of filtration products and the typical expected filter life spans were taken from an anonymous contact in the commercial filtration industry, as shown in Table 6 .

For example, a MERV 15 filter is expected to achieve 1.37 per hour in infectious droplet nuclei removal in the office environment with the mean assumption for infectious particle size distributions; for outdoor air ventilation to achieve the same risk reduction as filtration, the office HVAC system would need to provide 1.37 additional air changes per hour of outdoor air ventilation. Therefore, OA ventilation and HVAC filtration can be thought of as equivalent in terms of risk reduction (on the y-axis), but will differ in their cost estimates (on the x-axis).

MERV 13 and MERV 14 filters appear to achieve an optimal combination of lowest risk reductions at least costs. MERV 4 is actually more expensive to operate than providing equivalent outdoor air ventilation in each climate, primarily because of the very low effectiveness in controlling infectious aerosols. HEPA filtration appears to offer only a small incremental advantage over MERV 13e16 filters (i.e., 1e4% lower RR) for as much as 1.6e2.3 times the cost of operation, which suggests that MERV 13e16 filters may be most appropriate for cost-effectively reducing risks of influenza transmission in this particular indoor environment. In fact, switching from MERV 7 to MERV 13 could likely reduce the number of infected individuals in this office environment by one person at an additional annual cost of only $17. Compared to the estimated economic losses of a single influenza case of $375, MERV 13 Table 7 Estimated annual cost of filtration in the office environment.",

Additionally, it is clear that particle size distributions of expelled droplet nuclei should be measured in more standardized ways with much greater numbers of individuals than only those studies identified in the literature review and summarized in Table 2 .

DeR models have been used in recent studies to model infectious disease transmission using more mechanistic properties of both tuberculosis [73] and influenza [39, 71] ; however, DeR models also have their own inherent limitations, including often requiring interspecies extrapolation to estimate susceptibility of a human subject. Regardless, results from the modeling effort herein demonstrate that HVAC filtration can very likely play a role in preventing the transmission of airborne infectious diseases at lower costs than providing an equivalent amount of outdoor air ventilation, as previous studies have typically explored [3, 4, 6, 7] .",

Based on a series of assumptions about infectious particle size distributions resulting from human activities in indoor environments, the risk of acquiring the influenza virus from a single infector was modeled in a hypothetical office environment with a particular focus on what levels of risk reductions could be achieved by different levels of HVAC filtration and equivalent outdoor air ventilation, and at what costs of operation. Overall, recirculating HVAC filtration was predicted to achieve the greatest risk reductions at lower costs of operation than equivalent outdoor air ventilation, particularly for MERV 13e16 filters. Medium efficiency filtration products (MERV 7e11) are also inexpensive to operate but appear less effective in reducing infectious disease risks.",
