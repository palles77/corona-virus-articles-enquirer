Not only is it important to accurately determine the entity causing an infectious syndrome so that appropriate therapy may be given, it is also important because these interactions with the healthcare system likely result in a large amount of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. For example, a recent report by Mainous et a14' found that 60% of over 2000 patients seeking medical care were given at least one of 19 different antimicrobial agents for acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold). Less than 2% had an accompanying bacterial sinusitis or otitis.",

Searching for a specific organism, Streptococcus pyogenes, as the causative pathogen is the most common infectious disease diagnostic effort performed on the oral cavity. The primary cause of most microbial pharyngitis is a virus in most adults; however, S. pyogenes, also known as the group A P-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), is the most important organism to recognize. The inflammatory syndrome of the pharynx resulting from S. pyogenes infection is marked by a wide variety of signs and symptoms, and nearly always is accompanied by fever and sore throat.\" 35, It is important for physicians to accurately diagnose which organism is causing the disease because infection with GABHS should be treated with antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, whereas viruses do not respond to such therapy. S. pyogenes also causes suppurative infections of the tonsils, sinuses, and middle ear, or cellulitis as secondary sequelae after an episode of pharyngitis. Treatment of GABHS pharyngitis is crucial because this can shorten the duration of symptoms and prevent the spread of the organism to other patients. It will also prevent the potential damage that S. pyogenes may cause to the heart and kidneys from rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis, respectively.",

            "text": "The gold standard diagnostic test for GABHS infection is the throat culture. 6 Unfortunately the culture takes 24 to 48 hours to complete. If the patient leaves their physician or healthcare facility with a prescription for antibiotics, the treatment would then begin before the microbial entity is known. In the age of emerging drug resistance, unnecessary antimicrobial agent use must be avoided. Because untreated GABHS infection may have serious consequences for the patient, rapid detection methods for S. pyogenes were developed to give nearly immediate results in order to make the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis possible while the patient is still in the office or clinic. There are several manufacturers of rapid identification test kits for GABHS in the marketplace today.=, 47, 52 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviewed 25 published studies that examined the sensitivity of these rapid identification test kits. 18 They found the sensitivity of these tests ranged from 62% to 100%. Within any one institution, the sensitivity of a single kit varied by as much as 20%. Assuming that a good diagnostic screening test should have a sensitivity of at least 95% (so almost all infected patients will be detected), this study showed that a negative rapid identification test for GABHS cannot accurately rule out infection, and that a corresponding culture also is needed. 18 In a national survey, the College of American Pathologists (CAP) sent 2692 laboratories a swab seeded with S. pyogenes to perform a rapid detection test with the kit used at their institution. Fourteen different types of GABHS kits were assessed. The number of correct results ranged from 80% to loo%, with only three kits providing 100% accuracy for all participants. Those using these three kits comprised only 11% of the users. Based on this survey, and similar performance on previous CAP surveys, both the CAP and CDC recommend that a negative test result generated by a rapid identification test for GABHS must always be followed with a culture. This also is the current recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics. A useful approach is to collect two throat swabs, one for rapid testing and the other for culture. If the antigen test is positive, the second swab for culture is not needed. If the antigen test is negative, the second swab should be used to perform the culture. This approach can be an economic practice for an institution caring for a large number of children.",

This is because streptococcal pharyngitis is nearly exclusively a disease of 5to 15-year-0lds.~ Therefore, the chance of having a true positive screen test in an adult population is very low. As previously noted, the rapid, direct tests for S. pyogenes have a reported sensitivity ranging from 62% to loo%, with an excellent specificity of at least 95%; however, with a low GABHS prevalence adult patient population (55%), a full 50% of positive tests would be false-positive results, even with a test that was 100% sensitive and 95% specific (5 true-positive and 5 false-positive patients for each 100 tested). This leads to additional prescribing of unnecessary antibiotics for patients, with the risk of a serious adverse reaction in someone who did not need treatment. A study of 806 community patients with an overall 25.1% prevalence of GABHS recovered by culture, published in 1990, supports this concern.52 Using a direct \"rapid test did not add to a clinical evaluation, and compared to a well-done culture, it resulted in \"delayed treatment, unnecessary treatment, and increased costs.\" Compared to culture, the rapid test only had a positive predictive value of 61% and a negative predictive value of 89%.",

Multiplex PCR assays may soon offer the ability to rapidly and reliably detect them.23 A current exception is the need for diagnosis of EBV or CMV mononucleosis. This is most readily accomplished by use of serologic testing for the presence of heterophile antibodies (\"Monospot\" test) to diagnose acute EBV infection, or detection of IgM antibody directed against CMV for diagnosis of CMV mononucleosis.5 Use of accurate, rapid diagnostic tools can limit empiric antimicrobial agent therapy for pharyngitis and help reduce unnecessary use of these agents.= Another rare but important oral infection presentation is oral hairy leukoplakia in persons infected with H1V.Q This infection is best diagnosed by in situ hybridization for EBV from suspected lesions.

Oral bacteria are clearly important in other dental processes, such as caries and periodontitis, but clinical laboratories are not traditionally involved in culturing in such cases. Typically, periodontal infections have been managed by mechanical cleansing and empiric therapy. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease process is leading to a greater recognition of the role of bacterial originating agents and the modifying role of host defenses.21 When periodontal disease develops, it appears that the local microflora are able to penetrate the gingival epithelium and bring about an inflammatory response. This inflammation significantly contributes to the subsequent destruction of the periodontium. Another recent report suggests that a direct smear of plaque taken from the subgingival area (showing numerous spirochetes), and even culture with susceptibility testing may be useful for a specific diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy.\" Such an approach to specifically target the microbial plaque is consistent with the most recent understanding of disease pathogenesis. The common microbial species for this infection are given in Table 1 . This new approach is advocated based upon the evidence that specific therapy of anaerobic infection can be important for improved healing and a reduced need for surgery in the management of periodontal disease.\"",

            "text": "Regarding specimen collection, the main problem in obtaining oral or dental infection material is to avoid, or at least minimize, contamination with oral flora that is always present in abundance. To properly diagnose oral infections, either collecting purulent material from a biopsy or needle aspiration (preferred when possible) or material on swabs designed for transport of microbial cultures should be obtained. For collection of material from an intraoral abscess such as a root canal infection, the tooth can be isolated by means of a rubber dam. A sterile field is established, and the area is swabbed with disinfectant. The specimen is obtained and placed into nonnutritive anaerobic transport medium. Alternatively needle aspiration can be used if sufficient purulent material is present. Completely defining the flora of many such infections is beyond the scope of routine clinical microbiology laboratories. Specimens from neck space infections usually are obtained with a syringe and needle or by biopsy during an operative procedure. Transport must be under anaerobic conditions, as so many of these infections are due to anaerobes. Any swab, even those with calcium alginate-tips, can be toxic to some organisms. Even for aerobic bacteria, if transport is to be prolonged beyond 4 hours, some type of transport medium for the swab must be used to maintain viability. Because the oral cavity contains an abundant microbial flora, special testing procedures are often required. Table 1 reviews the major oral cavity infection syndromes, the pathogens responsible, and suggestions for optimal microbial detection. Routine culture swabs are adequate for recovery of adenoviruses and herpesviruses, and most bacteria and yeasts including C. diphtheriae, Mycoplasma, Candida spp, and Haemophilus spp; however, many of these pathogens require special processing, and thus, prior laboratory notification before specimen collection is highly recommended for optimal microbial detection. Nasopharyngeal swabs are better suited for recovery of respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Bordefella pertussis, Neisseria spp, and the viruses causing rhinitis.\" Modified Stuart's transport medium, as is often used in commercially produced swab systems, will preserve most viruses for a short time; however, nasopharyngeal swabs should ideally be transported in specially designed broth or other protein-containing fluid if they are not being cultured within a few hours. Recovery of C. diphfheriae is enhanced by culturing both throat and nasopharynx. Here, too, appropriate transport media should be used to preserve the microbe's viability. Aspirated nasopharyngeal secretions collected in a soft rubber bulb are the best specimens for B. pertussis. If this is impossible, transport for less than 2 hours in 1% casamino acid medium is acceptable.26, 31",

If sufficient numbers of pure colonies are not available on the primary culture plate, a subculture requiring additional growing time is necessary.

To grow this organism, freshly prepared Bordet-Gengou agar is the medium of choice for isolation of B. pertussis, and therefore, prior notification of the laboratory is needed when a suspected case of either diphtheria or pertussis occurs, as they would not be recovered on routine media available in most US microbiology laboratories? Interestingly, a modified medium designed for isolation of Legionella spp, buffered charcoal yeast extract agar with 3 pg/mL lincomycin and 80 pg/mL anisomycin, has been shown to yield good recovery of B. pertussis. Jones and Kendrick31 have also reported excellent recovery on a blood-free medium containing charcoal, heart infusion base, 2% agar, and 0.3 U/mL penicillin. The charcoal medium developed for Legionella spp is more readily available and is thus a useful substitute for many clinical laboratories. Specimens should be plated directly onto media, if possible, because the organisms are extremely delicate. The yield of positive isolations from clinical cases of pertussis varies from 20% to 98%, depending on the stage of disease and laboratory techniques used.",
