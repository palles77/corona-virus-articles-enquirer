            "text": "Methods: Based on the effects of 4 shRNAs targeting different regions of HTNV genomic RNA on viral replication, the most effective RNA interference fragments of the S and M genes were constructed in pSilencer-3.0-H1 vectors, and designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M, respectively. The antiviral effect of pSilencer-S/M against HTNV was evaluated in both HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells and mice. Results: In HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells, pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M targeted the viral nucleocapsid proteins and envelope glycoproteins, respectively, as revealed in the immunofluorescence assay. Transfection with pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (1, 2, and 4 \u03bcg) markedly inhibited the viral antigen expression in dose-and time-dependent manners. Transfection with either plasmid (2 \u03bcg) significantly decreased HTNV-RNA level at 3 day postinfectin (dpi) and the progeny virus titer at 5 dpi. In mice infected with lethal doses of HTNV, intraperitoneal injection of pSilencer-S or pSilencer-M (30 \u03bcg) considerably increased the survival rates and mean time to death, and significantly reduced the mean virus yields and viral RNA level, and alleviated virus-induced pathological lesions in lungs, brains and kidneys. Conclusion: Plasmid-based shRNAs potently inhibit HTNV replication in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide a basis for development of shRNA as therapeutics for HTNV infections in humans.",

Hantaviruses lead to two severe febrile diseases worldwide, ie, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia due to Old World hantavirus and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas due to New World hantavirus [3] . Approximately 60 000-100 000 HFRS cases are reported each year worldwide, and the mortality rate can reach 10% [1, 4] . Hantaviruses belong to the genus Hantavirus of the Bunyaviridae family, and they are enveloped, single-strand, negative-sense, tri-segmented RNA viruses. The viral genomes consist of large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments that encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and two envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) and a nucleocapsid (N) protein. Variations in the M and S segments may influence the antigenicity and virulence of hantaviruses [5, 6] .",

RNAi reagents have also been reported to potently and specifically inhibit the replication of different viruses, including HIV, HBV [11] , HSV [12] , SAR-CoV [13] , influenza virus [14, 15] , coxsackievirus [16] and others.

However, the application of siRNAs has been limited by their short half-lives, the high costs of synthetic siRNAs and instability due to degradation by nucleases. Another method for inducing RNAi is via the transfection of plasmids that express antiviral short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and this method is also an efficient means of eliciting RNAi in vivo [15, 21] . Our results indicated that the With the exception of ribavirin, no antiviral drugs for the treatment of hantavirus infection have been identified. Several members of the Bunyaviridae family, particularly HTNV, are sensitive to ribavirin [8] . We have reported that ribavirin can induce an up to 3.6-fold decrease in the vRNA level in HTNV infection at 4 dpi [20] , which is equivalent to the in vitro effects of pSilencer-S and -M observed in our experiments. With regard to the in vivo administration, the RNAi plasmid treatments increased the survival rate to 27.3% in a lethal HTNVinfected suckling mouse model. Zhou et al reported that the NP-specific siRNA expression plasmid pBabe-NP protected two of the eight mice (2/8) challenged with the lethal dose of avian influenza virus (H5N1) that killed all of the control mice [15] ; this result is similar to the antiviral effects of the other siRNA expression plasmids against HTNV observed in our in vivo experiments. However, we noticed that ribavirin has been reported to be capably of affording 100% protection against lethal Andes virus infections in hamsters [8] and also increases the survival rate to 81.8% in SEOV-infected suckling ICR mice [23] . The explanation of these phenomena may be related to the delivery of siRNA. The shRNA expression plasmid was distributed in the brain because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of newborn mice is immature [24] . However, as a nonviral vector, the pSilencer shRNA expression vector does not readily cross the cellular membrane and is not stably introduced into the cells. Further studies are required to solve this problem, which is frequently considered a hurdle for the development of siRNA-based therapeutics [25] .",
