The SASP is important in influencing the behavior of neighboring cells and altering the microenvironment; yet, this role has been mainly attributed to soluble factors. Here, we show that both the soluble factors and small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are capable of transmitting paracrine senescence to nearby cells. Analysis of individual cells internalizing sEVs, using a Cre-reporter system, show a positive correlation between sEV uptake and senescence activation. We find an increase in the number of multivesicular bodies during senescence in vivo. sEV protein characterization by mass spectrometry (MS) followed by a functional siRNA screen identify interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as being partially responsible for transmitting senescence to normal cells. We find that sEVs contribute to paracrine senescence.",

            "text": "The establishment of cellular senescence is categorized by a stable cell-cycle arrest and the capacity to modify the microenvironment through a particular secretome called SASP (senescence-associated secretory phenotype). The activation of senescence is a response to different cellular stresses to prevent the propagation of damaged cells and has been shown to occur in vitro and in vivo. In fact, an enrichment in the number of senescent cells has been observed in vivo during both biological and pathological processes such as development, cancer, fibrosis, and wound healing (He and Sharpless, 2017; Mu\u00f1 oz-Esp\u00edn and Serrano, 2014) . The SASP controls its surroundings by reinforcing senescence in an autocrine (cell autonomous) and paracrine (non-cell autonomous) manner, by recruiting immune cells to eliminate senescent cells and by inducing a stem cell-like phenotype in damaged cells (Mosteiro et al., 2016; Ocampo et al., 2016) . The SASP provides the necessary balance to restore tissue homeostasis when it has been compromised. Paradoxically, the SASP can also contribute to the enhancement of tissue damage and the induction of inflammation and cancer proliferation. Overall, the mechanisms behind the pleiotropic activities of the SASP in different contexts are not well understood (Salama et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "Most studies in vitro and in vivo have attributed the diverse functions of the SASP to individual protein components such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) or IL-8 to reinforce autocrine senescence (Acosta et al., 2008; Kuilman et al., 2008) or transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) as the main mediator of paracrine senescence (Acosta et al., 2013; Rapisarda et al., 2017) or to a dynamic SASP with a switch between TGF-b and IL-6 as predominant individual components (Hoare et al., 2016) . However, it is still unclear how these diverse SASP components regulate senescence. In fact, inhibition of the SASP by blocking the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) only partially prevents paracrine senescence, suggesting that alternative mechanisms may exist (Herranz et al., 2015; Laberge et al., 2015) . Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) (30-120 nm) of endocytic origin, whereas microvesicles are formed by the shedding of the plasma membrane. Exosomes and microvesicles are secreted by all cell types and found in most bodily fluids. Both contain nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids that generally reflect the status of the parental cell and can influence the behavior of recipient cells locally and systemically (O'Loghlen, 2018; Tkach and Th\u00e9 ry, 2016) . The increasing literature regarding EVs show that they are disease biomarkers (Melo et al., 2015) , indicators of cancer metastasis (Hoshino et al., 2015) , and therapeutic carriers (Kamerkar et al., 2017) . However, although some studies have found an increase in the number of EVs released during senescence (Lehmann et al., 2008; Takasugi et al., 2017) , very little is known regarding the role that EVs play as SASP mediators in the senescent microenvironment.",

            "text": "To investigate whether EVs act as intercellular mediators during senescence, we took advantage of HFFF2 human foreskin primary fibroblasts expressing an empty vector or oncogenic H-RAS G12V in a 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT)-inducible form (ER:EV or ER:H-RAS G12V ). These cells undergo senescence upon treatment with 200 nM 4OHT (Rapisarda et al., 2017) , without activating the apoptosis pathway, and we have called them iC or iRAS, respectively. The treatment of HFFF2s with whole conditioned media (CM) from iC and iRAS (mimicking OIS) confirm previous findings that senescence can be transmitted in a non-cell-autonomous (paracrine) fashion (Acosta et al., 2013) . Recipient HFFF2s present a decrease in cell proliferation (staining with crystal violet) and an increase in the percentage of cells staining positive for senescence-associated-b-galactosidase (SA-b-Gal) ( Figure S1A ). Next, we dissected the CM from iC and iRAS HFFF2s and isolated large (MV) and small EV (sEV) from the same CM. We followed the well-characterized serial ultracentrifugation protocol (Th\u00e9 ry et al., 2006) filtering the sEV fraction with a 0.22-mm filter and compared the effect of the MV and sEV fractions in inducing paracrine senescence in comparison to the supernatant (SN) fraction (soluble fraction depleted of MV and sEV) ( Figure 1A ). Both the SN and sEV fraction from iRAS cells induced an upregulation of several markers of senescence in normal HFFF2 compared to iC, as shown by a decrease in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, an increase in p16 INK4A protein expression levels, the percentage of positive cells for phosphorylated-gH2AX (p-gH2AX), and the accumulation of p53 by immunofluorescence (IF) (Figures 1B and 1C) . Although MVs isolated from iC or iRAS induced a reduction in the incorporation of BrdU, no other markers of senescence were observed, suggesting that only the SN and sEVs from iRAS cells transmit paracrine senescence. Next, to determine whether the cell-cycle arrest observed by the delay in proliferation was maintained long term, we treated HFFF2 twice for 72 h with the different fractions, replated the cells, and determined the growth potential at different days ( Figure 1D ). As observed in Figure 1E , only the SN and sEV fractions derived from iRAS cells were able to induce a delay in proliferation in comparison with the iC. To confirm sEV-PS induction, we treated HFFF2s with increasing concentrations of sEVs derived from iRAS compared to the highest dose of sEVs from iC and observed a dose-dependent senescent response by quantifying the percentage of cells staining positive for SA-b-Gal and the levels of p53 + and BrdU + cells by IF (Figures S1B and S1C). Furthermore, treatment of HFFF2 with the same number of sEVs also transmits the senescent phenotype as shown by the decrease in BrdU incorporation and IL-8 staining by IF ( Figure S1D ), suggesting that the sEV content but not particle number is responsible for sEV-PS. To confirm that sEV-PS was not due to contaminants present in our sEV preparations, we isolated sEVs using an alternative isolation technique, size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The absence of protein contaminants and presence of particles in the sEV fractions were determined (not shown). As can be seen in Figure S1E , sEV isolated by SEC can also mediate paracrine senescence. Therefore, both the soluble fraction and sEVs are responsible for mediating a delay in proliferation and inducing an increase in the expression levels of diverse biomarkers of senescence.",

The comparison of immunoblotting analysis of cells and sEV lysates derived from iC and iRAS cells showed the presence of different exosomerelated proteins (CD63, TSG101, and ALIX) in our sEV preparations (Figures S1F and S1G). Furthermore, we confirmed the absence of proteins related to intracellular compartments, calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum), and COX IV (mitochondria) to assess the purity of our sEV preparations ( Figure S1G ). Changes in the expression levels of annexin V could not be observed between iC and iRAS cells lysates, while it was detected in sEVs derived from iRAS cells, as described (Ostrowski et al., 2010; Th\u00e9 ry et al., 2018) ( Figure S1H ). We verified the sEV morphology and size by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ( Figure S1I ) and the sEV population released in iRAS cells by specifically capturing sEVs onto beads coated with a CD63 antibody, followed by a CD81-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibody. In fact, at different time points after inducing senescence, an increase can be seen in CD81 fluorescence intensity and therefore a release in sEVs containing simultaneously CD63 + /CD81 + ( Figure S1J ). Previous studies have shown that cells undergoing senescence release more sEVs (Kavanagh et al., 2017; Lehmann et al., 2008; Takasugi et al., 2017) . Thus, we quantified the number and size of sEVs by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) in iRAS cells and HFFF2s treated with 50 mM etoposide (Etop) for 48 h, which does not induce apoptosis, followed by 5 days' incubation with fresh medium (mimicking DNA damage-induced senescence [DDIS]). As shown in Figure S1K , an increase in sEV release during senescence can be observed by NTA analysis. We also show an increase in the release of sEVs during senescence in a variety of human cells and mouse cells: (1) Figure S1L ). We did not observe changes in sEV size distribution with any of the triggers of senescence (data not shown). Our results show that different triggers of senescence induce the release of sEVs in a variety of human cells and mouse cells and that some of these sEVs present exosome-like features.",

            "text": "To confirm that sEVs from senescent cells induce paracrine senescence (sEV-PS), we performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of HFFF2s treated with sEVs derived from iRAS and from HFFF2s treated with Etop, mimicking OIS and DDIS, respectively ( Figure 2A ). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of genes deregulated by >2 log 2 fold difference expression levels and p < 0.05 in both OIS-and DDIS-sEV-treated HFFF2s confirmed a shared ''cell cycle'' and ''cell proliferation'' signature ( Figure 2B) , with the ''p53 signaling pathway'' being overrepresented ( Figure 2C ). Furthermore, HFFF2 cells treated with sEVs derived from both OIS and DDIS also showed a significant SASP and ''inflammatory response'' signature ( Figures 2D and S2A) . We next used a small molecule inhibitor, spiroepoxide (SpE), which has been described as blocking the enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) and as inhibiting exosome biogenesis and release (Hannun and Obeid, 2008; Trajkovic et al., 2008) . Treatment of iRAS cells with SpE (5 mM) did not induce cell death. However, we did observe prevention of the senescent signature by RNAseq and a decrease in sEV release by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figures 2D and S2B ) and NTA ( Figure S2C ). Comparison of the paracrine senescent signature previously described to be mediated by soluble factors (Acosta et al., 2013) (SN-PS) with the signature provided by sEVs (sEV-PS) in the RNA-seq data show a significant correlation between both mediators of senescence ( Figure 2E ). ELISA analysis of different SASP components in the SN or within lysed sEVs shows that the concentration of IL-6, IL-8, or active in sEV lysates from iRAS is similar to or lower than the concentration observed in the SN from iC samples, which cannot induce senescence ( Figure 1 ). Similar results were observed analyzing the CM (data not shown), suggesting that these individual SASP components are not responsible for sEV-PS. Validation of the RNA-seq data shows that HFFF2s treated with iC and iRAS-derived sEVs show an increase in the mRNA expression levels of cell-cycle regulators CDKN2A, CDKN1A, components of the SASP, and integrin b3 subunit (ITGB3), which regulates senescence (Rapisarda et al., 2017) (Figures 2G and S2E) . A comparable response was observed by IF and immunoblotting at the protein level ( Figures 2H and S2F ). Similar results were obtained in HFFF2s treated with sEVs isolated from HFFF2s undergoing DDIS ( Figure S2G ). iRAS HFFF2s expressing a vector encoding for 2 previously characterized short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting TP53 (shp53) and CDKN2A (shp16) that prevent the establishment of senescence (Acosta et al., (C) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis shows the ''p53 signaling pathway'' as representative upon HFFF2 treatment with sEVs isolated from senescent cells (from both OIS and DDIS). (D) Bioinformatics analysis of SASP mRNA transcripts in HFFF2 treated with sEVs from iRAS and iC cells. The upregulation of SASP transcripts is prevented when iRAS cells were treated with 5 mM spiroepoxide (SpE; inhibitor of the enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase N-SMase). Data have been normalized to the control and represent the reads per kilobase million (RPKM)-log 2 fold difference. (E) Comparison between the paracrine senescence (PS) signature identified by Acosta et al. (2013) Figure S2H ). We next wanted to confirm that the sEV-PS response was not due to HFFF2 cells undergoing genotoxic stress. We isolated sEVs from HFFF2 cells treated with Etop for 1 day (pre-senescent) and 6 days (senescent) and treated normal HFFF2s to determine their response. As shown in Figures S2I and S1J, the 6-day-derived sEVs induced a reduction in BrdU incorporation and an increase in p-g-H2AX, while no effect was observed upon treatment with the 1-day isolated sEVs. These data suggest that sEVs mediate paracrine senescence independently of the SASP and the induction of early genotoxic damage.",

            "text": "Next, we investigated whether inhibition of the N-SMase enzyme prevents sEV-PS. For this, we treated iRAS cells with increasing concentrations of 2 independent N-SMase inhibitors: SpE (2 and 5 mM) and GW4869 (1 and 10 mM). Torin-2 (25 and 50 nM), an mTOR inhibitor that suppresses the SASP (Herranz et al., 2015; Laberge et al., 2015) , was used as a control. None of the inhibitors or concentrations used induced cellular toxicity. We then washed the treated cells, added fresh media for 72 h, and treated normal HFFF2s for an additional 72 h with the altered CMs ( Figures 3A-3C ). As shown in Figure 3B , the highest concentrations of SpE and GW4869 prevented the cell-cycle arrest mediated by the CM of iRAS, while Torin-2 had no effect (Herranz et al., 2015; Laberge et al., 2015) . The bypass of the arrest mediated by the CM from iRAS cells treated with SpE correlated with a decrease in the expression levels of p21 CIP ( Figure S3A ). Furthermore, the CM from both GW4869and SpE-treated cells prevented the upregulation of IL-8 and p-gH2AX mediated by the CM of iRAS cells in normal HFFF2 ( Figures 3B, 3C , S3B, and S3C). A similar response was observed in an additional strain of fibroblasts, IMR-90, by measuring the levels of expression of p21 CIP and p-gH2AX by IF ( Figures S3D and S3E ). Next, we used Transwell inserts to induce a physical separation between the cells and used a 0.4-mm pore membrane to avoid the transfer of larger vesicles. We plated iC and iRAS with the different treatments in the upper chamber (UC) and later plated HFFF2 in the lower chamber (LC), adding fresh CM ( Figure 3D ). As per our previous data, treatment with GW4869 and SpE prevented paracrine senescence, which was observed by an increase in cells incorporating BrdU in the LC and expressing lower levels of p16 INK4A ( Figures  3E and 3F ). These data suggest that the dose-dependent inhibition of N-SMase using two independent small-molecule inhibitors prevents paracrine senescence.",

            "text": "The Endosome Pathway Is Enhanced during Senescence In Vivo We next investigated whether proteins involved in the endosome pathway were differentially expressed during senescence. HFFF2 cell lysates extracted from iC and iRAS cells showed no differences at the endogenous levels of TSG101 or ALIX during senescence, while a clear increase in CD63 and other markers of senescence (p16 INK4A and p21 CIP ) were detected ( Figures  4A and 4B ). Subsequently, to test whether CD63 expression was increased in vivo, we took advantage of human fibrotic lung samples previously described to be enriched in senescent cells (Schafer et al., 2017) and evaluated the expression levels of CD63 by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We observed a significant increase in CD63 signal in areas enriched for SA-b-Gal + cells in comparison with areas with fewer SA-b-Gal + cells in a variety of human fibrotic lung samples ( Figures 4C, 4D , and S4A). Next, to determine whether changes in the endocytic pathway occur during senescence in vivo, we took advantage of a mouse model of OIS. We used a transgenic mouse expressing a conditional Ptf1a Cre -driven activated Kras (Ptf1a Cre ;lsl-Kras G12D ) allele, which develops premalignant intra-epithelial neoplasias (PanIN) (Hingorani et al., 2003) , and presents different markers and features of senescence ( Figure S4B ) (Caldwell et al., 2012; Morton et al., 2010) . We subjected the pancreas from wild-type (WT) or Kras G12D mice to electron microscopy staining and imaging and found that Kras G12D -derived PanIN showed an increase in MVB formation in comparison with WT epithelial ducts (Figures 4E and 4F) . We also observed an increase in the number of lysosomes, secretory vesicles, and mitochondria per cell in PanINs when compared to WT epithelial ducts ( Figure S4B ) (Helman et al., 2016) . Therefore, we observed that the endocytic pathway is altered during senescence in humans and mice in vivo.",

For this, we subjected isolated sEVs from iRAS and Etop-treated HFFF2 and control cells to label-free quantitative MS analysis ( Figure 6A ). GO analysis of the 1,600 proteins identified show the cellular component ''extracellular exosome'' is overrepresented ( Figure 6B ). To identify proteins common to both stimuli inducing senescence, we selected proteins deregulated in both OIS-and DDIS-sEV versus control sEV with >2 log 2 fold change difference and adjusted false discovery rate (FDR) <0.01 in both OIS and DDIS. The Venn diagram analysis shows that 265 proteins are deregulated in sEVs in both OIS and DDIS ( Figure 6C ), which group into GO biological processes related to senescence as ''wound healing'' and ''cell adhesion'' ( Figure 6D ). Volcano plot analysis comparing individually OIS-and DDIS-sEV protein content versus their respective controls shows that most proteins identified within sEVs derived from senescent HFFF2 are upregulated ( Figure S6A ). We found few previously described components of the SASP within the sEV proteomics analysis. A comparative analysis between the soluble factors found in previous publications (Acosta et al., 2013) and the sEV protein content show no significant correlation ( Figure 6E ). Therefore, the protein content in sEVs derived from cells undergoing DDIS and OIS is different from control-derived sEV protein content, although many sEV proteins are common to both senescence inducers.",

After applying this cutoff, we selected the top 50 most abundant proteins upregulated in both DDIS and OIS ( Figure 6F ; Table S1 ) and conducted a small-scale screen using siRNA SMARTpool. We used the whole CM from iRAS as an indicator to determine overall paracrine senescence in normal HFFF2 using a scramble (Scr) siRNA or previously validated siRNA targeting TP53 (sip53) and CDKN2A (sip16) as a positive control (green bars) (Rapisarda et al., 2017) and determined BrdU incorporation and p21 CIP protein levels by IF ( Figures 6G and S6B) . From the primary screen, we selected the top 4 siRNAs that prevented cell-cycle arrest by BrdU and analyzed additional markers of senescence by IF-p16 INK4A and p-gH2AX ( Figure S6C ). The IFN signaling pathway has been recently described as regulating senescence (Yu et al., 2015) , and within the siRNA validated from the screen, we found the IFN-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) ( Figure 6G , red bars).",

By capturing IFITM3 + sEVs onto beads and detecting CD81 by FACS, we confirmed that iRAS cells released more IFITM3 + / CD81 + sEV particles than the iC cells ( Figure 7E ). To determine whether IFITM3 + sEVs belong to the same complex as CD63 + sEVs, we performed the OptiPrep density gradient and confirmed that they both float at the same density ( Figure S7C ), suggesting that sEVs containing IFITM3 are also positive for CD81 and CD63.",

We depleted IFITM3 from iRAS cells using siIFITM3, confirming a reduction in the expression levels of IFITM3 in the donor cells and their derived sEVs ( Figures 7C, 7F , and S7B). The treatment of HFFF2 with an equal number of sEVs derived from iRAS + siIFITM3 prevented the upregulation of p16 INK4A and IL-8 mediated by sEVs from iRAS cells ( Figure 7G ). A similar response was observed using stable HFFF2 infected with a previously validated shRNA targeting IFITM3 (Huang et al., 2011) ( Figures S7D and S7E ). However, there was no difference in the number of sEVs released from iRAS cells with or without both siIFITM3 and shIFITM3 ( Figure S7F ), confirming that the depletion of IFITM3 did not alter sEV particle secretion. Next, we generated HFFF2s expressing a lentiviral (C) MCF7 breast cancer cells expressing a Cre recombinase construct (Cre + MCF7) were treated with DMSO or 500 nM palbociclib (Palbo) for 10 days to induce senescence. sEVs were purified from Cre + MCF7 cells (Cre-sEV) and used to treat MCF7 cells expressing a fluorescent reporter gene, which switches from expressing DsRed to eGFP upon sEV internalization (reporter MCF7).

The expression levels of IFITM3 were increased in 6 of 10 elderly human donors, while there was very little change in the expression levels of the sEVs derived from young donors (Figures 7J, 7K, and S7I). Furthermore, the elderly human donors released more sEVs than did their younger counterparts ( Figure S7J ). Non-cell autonomous (paracrine) senescence via the SASP has been previously described as an important mechanism during senescence (Acosta et al., 2013; Dou et al., 2017; Hoare et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2012) , although these studies do not discern between the effect of soluble factors and EVs. Here, we provide evidence that both the SN and sEVs are responsible for mediating paracrine senescence (SN-PS and sEV-PS, respectively). In fact, a transcriptome analysis comparing SN-PS (Acosta et al., 2013 ) and sEV-PS shows a significant senescent signature. Furthermore, a broad MS analysis of the published protein composition of SN (Acosta et al., 2013) and the present article's sEV proteomics shows little correlation between both fractions, suggesting that although the downstream signaling is similar, the triggers inducing senescence are diverse. However, a more comprehensive and sensitive methodology would be needed to confirm this. The use of a Cre loxP reporter system to determine EV internalization shows a positive correlation between sEV uptake and paracrine senescence activation.",

            "text": "Recently, many studies have found a cellular response that is characteristic of infectious agents during senescence in the absence of pathogens. For example, it has been shown that the SASP is regulated by the inflammasome via IL-1a signaling (Acosta et al., 2013) and by the cGAS-STING (cyclic guanosine monophosphate [GMP]-AMP synthase linked to the stimulator of IFN genes) pathway (Dou et al., 2017; Gl\u20ac uck et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017) . Both pathways are induced during senescence in the absence of pathogens or double-stranded DNA. MS analysis of sEVs derived from OIS and DDIS show that IFITM3, which is implicated in the IFN signaling pathway, is accumulated in sEVs derived from both OIS and DDIS and is not detectable in the soluble fraction of the SASP (Acosta et al., 2013) . IFITM3 endogenous expression levels are unchanged in donor cells during senescence but accumulate in sEVs derived from iRAS, which may suggest that IFITM3 could be selectively packaged into sEVs during OIS. We find that IFITM3 within sEVs is partially responsible for sEV-PS, as depletion of IFITM3 from sEVs using independent RNAi partially prevents sEV-PS. Conversely, the generation of a stable HFFF2 cell line ectopically expressing IFITM3 does not induce senescence in the donor cells, while sEVs derived from these cells are capable of inducing a DNA damage response and upregulation of p16 INK4A . In fact, other investigators have found that IFN signaling can be mediated via EVs in neural stem cells (Cossetti et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013) and that DNA from senescent cells can be secreted via EVs (Takahashi et al., 2017) . The relevance of individual components within EVs has also been described in different biological contexts such as cancer. EVs contain particular protein components, such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, integrins, or the receptor kinase MET, that allow both immunosuppression and evasion of immune surveillance (O'Loghlen, 2018) . However, that additional components of the senescent sEV (DNA, RNA, or lipids) could play a role in mediating sEV-PS cannot be dismissed.",

It is interesting that elderly human donors release more sEVs and that the sEVs found in plasma show higher protein levels of IFITM3 in 60% of the elderly donors. Although it may be tempting to speculate that IFITM3 within sEVs could be involved in aging, a larger cohort of young and elderly patients would be needed. We show here that sEVs are responsible for mediating paracrine senescence and speculate that they could be involved in inducing bystander senescence during therapy-induced senescence (Demaria et al., 2017) or aging (Acosta et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2012) . In fact, when compared to soluble factors, sEVs have different biophysical and biochemical properties as they have a longer lifespan than do soluble factors and they are more resistant to protease degradation (O'Loghlen, 2018) . The idea that blocking sEV secretion could be a potential therapeutic approach to alleviate senescence ''spreading'' during chemotherapy-induced senescence or in aging tissues presents itself as a very attractive tool for the future.",
