In a homogeneous and non-spatial model there is a straightforward relationship between the basic reproductive ratio, R 0 , and the final epidemic size; however when there is a significant spatial component to disease spread and the population is heterogeneous predicting how the epidemic size varies with the initial source of infection is far more complex. Here we use a well-developed spatiotemporal model of the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, parameterised to match the 2001 UK outbreak, to address the relationship between the scale of the epidemic and the nature of the initially infected farm. We show that there is considerable heterogeneity in both the likelihood of a epidemic and the epidemic impact (total number of farms losing livestock to either infection or control) and that these two elements are best captured by measurements at different spatial scales. The likelihood of an epidemic can be predicted from a knowledge of the reproduction ratio of the initial farm (R i ), whereas the epidemic impact conditional on an epidemic occurring is best predicted by averaging the second-generation reproduction ratio in a 58 km ring around the infected farm. Combining these two predictions provides a good assessment of both the local and larger-scale heterogeneities present in this complex system.",

From a probabilistic argument we find that this basic formulation is independent of the natural history of the pathogen (Keeling & Rohani 2007) . However, the expected total number of cases is influenced by the risk of early stochastic extinction. Considering the early epidemic as a branching process, the probability of extinction (before a major epidemic) starting with a single infected individual is: (Kermack & McKendrick 1927; Keeling 2004) , where the two values give the probability of extinction assuming exponentially distributed infectious periods (a constant rate of recovery) and fixed duration infectious periods respectively (Keeling & Rohani 2007) . The probability of an infection occurring is an important quantity when predicting final epidemic size -faced with an epidemic threat, policy makers are concerned with the risk of an epidemic occurring and, should an epidemic occur, the resultant epidemic size. We therefore see that for stochastic populations the expected total number of cases should be approximated by the standard final size expression combined with the probability that the initial infection manages to cause an epidemic:",

These parameters are estimated from the 2001 epidemic data; previous work has found that this power law model provides a closer fit to the 2001 data than one in which the powers are set to unity (Tildesley et al 2008) . As in previous versions of the model, the parameters are estimated for five distinct regions: Cumbria, Devon, the rest of England (excluding Cumbria and Devon), Scotland and Wales.

In contrast, when there is a strong spatial element to transmission (but the population is otherwise homogeneous) then the secondgeneration basic reproductive ratio is generally smaller than the primary as the secondary cases find themselves in an environment with a reduced local density of susceptibles (negative spatial correlations have developed between susceptible and infectious individuals) and hence a reduced potential to cause further cases.

In fact at the threshold value of R i = 1 we find that 20% of initial seedings generate epidemics; this probability increases to around 50% for the largest R i values. These results clearly highlight the stochastic nature of the disease in its early stages, and the dependence of the ensuing epidemic on favourable local conditions in the neighbourhood of the initial infection. The reason why low R i farms are still capable of generating a large epidemic is exemplified in figure 2 : farms with low R i may still have values of above the threshold of one and therefore if the infection spreads beyond the initial farm its likely success is dramatically increased.

Therefore, a more appropriate indicator of epidemic size may come from averaging individual farm-level reproductive ratios in a local region around each farm. We therefore investigate how the accuracy with which we can predict the epidemic impact varies as we adjust the scale of the region in which we take the average (parameter D in equation 1). We consistently find that averaging within a radius of D \u2248 50 -60km provides the best predictors, and more specifically that predicting the conditional epidemic impact offers the best match between local properties and large-scale epidemic potential (figures 3b and c). This scale of 58km is clearly a compromise between a range of epidemiological factors, in particular the ability to find regions of sufficient livestock density to support a continuing epidemic in both the short and long term. Table 2 provides a more detailed examination of errors associated with predicting the epidemic impact; we consistently find that provides a better prediction (lower error) than R i , and that averages over 58km provide a better prediction than the individual-level measures.

An analysis of the role of R i on final epidemic impact when infection occurs on farm i sheds some light on the ability of models to predict the risk of large scale outbreaks of disease based upon early epidemic behaviour. A large range of epidemic impacts is observed, with largest epidemics generally found to occur when primary cases are in Wales, Devon, the North of England and Southern Scotland. This is unsurprising -these regions were epidemic hotspots during the 2001 epidemic. We note that the work presented in this paper focuses on Foot-and-Mouth disease and the 2001 strain of FMD specifically and, whilst the general results could be applied to other diseases, more work would need to be done to establish the conclusions for a range of livestock and human diseases, as well as for other strains of FMD.",

The number of cases infected by the source farm in the first generation provides a measure of the local spatial distribution of infected farms. However, the number of subsequent cases produced by an average secondary case is far more informative about the spread of infection, as it includes the establishment of spatial correlations and the competition for local susceptible farms. In theory, this process could be extended to examine terms, but these higher-order terms would need to be calculated by multiple simulations rather than numerically reducing their immediate use.",

We are still a long way from solving the general problem of percolation of infection through a highly heterogeneous environment, but by analysing the sensitivity of our result to the culling effort we gain some understanding of its robustness. We consider two other epidemic scenarios: doubling the control culling levels and only culling infected farms. These two extreme cases lead to similar optimal averaging scales of 56.5km and 62km respectively, although the nonparameteric function used to predict the epidemic impact is very different in both cases. This provides some evidence that for foot-and-mouth disease in the UK livestock industry, taking a spatial average within a 50-60km radius consistantly generates a useful measure of the likely extent of an epidemic.",

It remains to be seen what epidemiological factors contribute to the optimal scale of 58km; we feel that this scale coincides with the spatial scale of heterogeneity within the UK livestock industry -the spatial aggregation of cattle in Cumbria occurs at a comparable scale.",

We have shown that it is dangerous to simply average R i without paying particular attention to issues of spatial scale, and that no single measure can capture the two elements of risk and consequences. In this example, both the individual level values of R i and a more wide-scale spatial average control the potential for an epidemic and its subsequent impact. Of course, we are yet to reach the stage of obtaining true understanding of percolation in a heterogeneous spatial environment. However, such results as presented in this paper may help us to identify high-risk regions in other countries or when different strains lead to alternative epidemiological parameters. (a) The probability of an epidemic against R i and (b) Epidemic Impact against . In both graphs 95% confidence intervals on epidemic impact are shown. The shaded region shows the 95% confidence intervals of the mean of the y-axis quantity. Graph (c) shows the errors in predicting epidemic impact when errors are calculated based upon R i and values of each farm, where these values are averaged over rings of varying radii. Spatial plot of the predicted epidemic impact based upon the value of multiplied by the predicted probability that an epidemic occurs. Each point corresponds to the predicted epidemic impact for an epidemic seeded on each individual farm in the UK. An epidemic is defined as occurring if 10 or more farms are infected.

Since the 2001 epidemic, a range of publications (including Keeling et al 2001, Ferguson et al 2001, Le Menach et al 2005) have constructed maps of the local average farmlevel basic reproductive ratio values (R i ) to act as a spatial prediction of at-risk regions and the likely spatial extent of an epidemic (see for example Fig 1a).
