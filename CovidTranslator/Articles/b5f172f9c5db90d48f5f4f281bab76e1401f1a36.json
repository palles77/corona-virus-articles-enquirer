However a reliable estimation of the number of infected, including asymptomatic people, turns out to be crucial in the preparation of operational schemes and to estimate the future number of people, who will require, to different extents, medical attentions. In order to overcome the current data shortcoming, this paper proposes a bootstrap-driven, estimation procedure for the number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2. This method is designed to be robust, automatic and suitable to generate estimations at regional level. Obtained results show that, while official data at March the 12th report 12.839 cases in Italy, people infected wiyh the SARS-CoV-2 could be as high as 105.789.",

In this perspective, the adopted model -of the type semiparametric -consists of two parts: a purely nonparametric and a parametric one. While the former does not pose problems in terms of DOF, the latter clearly does. However, the sacrifice in terms of DOF is very limited as an autoregressive model of order 1 (employed in a suitable distance function, as below illustrated) has proved sufficient for the purpose. DOF-saving strategy is also the driving force of the choice not to consider as an exogenous parameter the georeferencing of Regions or to include the regional population in a regression-like scheme but to implicitly assumed these variable embedded in the dynamic of the time series in question.",

In essence, the choice of the most appropriate resampling method is far from being an easy task, especially when the identical and independent distribution iid assumption (Efron's initial bootstrap method) is violated. Under dependence structures embedded in the data, simple sampling with replacement has been proved -see, for example Carlstein et al. (1986) -to yield suboptimal results. As a matter of fact, iid-based bootstrap schmes are not designed to capture, and therefore replicate, dependence structures. This is especially true under the actual conditions (small sample sizes).
