Sera from patients with self-limited (n = 58), acute (n = 23), and chronic (n = 8) hepatitis were analysed. One of the sera with markers of a prior infection and two sera of chronically infected patients reacted with a protein synthesized in E. coli that contains the middle part of the predicted polymerase. Other E. coli fusion proteins containing overlapping or different regions of P-ORF were used to localize antigenic domains. Antibody binding to two different domains representing the middle and the C-terminal region of P-ORF was obtained in the sera of chronically infected patients. Our findings are indirect evidence for the in vivo expression of the complete HBV polymerase reading frame.",

In contrast, Munoz and Carrasco (1984) maintained that in Hela cells the HSV1 (KOS) protein and virion formation are complete IFN-a resistant. However, we demonstrate that the viral IE protein translation of both virus strains, KOS and McIntyre, is IFN-a sensitive in both, human fibroblasts and HeLa cells, though significantly less in the latter. In addition, we found that hu. rec. TNF-a, alone or in a synergistic combination with hu. rec. IFN-y, impedes HSVl IE protein formation likewise, whereas SV40 early gene expression is more sensitively arrested by IFN-a than by TNF-a plus IFN-y and is almost resistant against TNF-a alone. Finally we observed that TNF-a alone or in combination with IFN-y was unable either to increase or to accelerate the cytopathiceffect of cellspreviously infected with HSV1 (human fibroblasts), SV40 (Te 7) or rubella virus (vero cells Treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from healthydonors with purifiedHBs Ag resultedin interferongamma productionin a dose dependentmanner.

MOSKOPHIDIS Heinrich-Pettc-Inst. f. Exp. Virologic u. Immunologie, Univ., 0 -2000 Hamburg The mechanism with which higher organisms control virus infections is uncertain. According to one widely accepted hypothesis cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) destroy infected cells in vivo, thereby blocking further virus replication. In the BALB/c mouse LCM virusspecific CTL are restricted solely by the class I antigen \"L\". In the BALBic-derived mutant C-H-2 d m\" L is altered and cannot act as a restriction element. Although few if any LCM virus-specific CTL are generated, these mice are perfectly capable of eliminating the virus. Also, transfer of immune cells from mutants into infected BALB/c mice or vice versa efficiently accelerates virus elimination from the recipients. We interpret these observations to mean that CTL playa central rote in in the control of the LCM virus in the mouse, however not by lysing virus-infected cells but rather by releasing (or inducing release of) factors that inhibit virus replication in nearby cells. We generated a monoclonal antibody (Q 19/10) which binds to the glycosylated preS2 domaine of hepatitis B viral surface (HBsAg). Binding of this antibody is inhibitited by chemically cross-linked human serum albunim and by normal human serum. The natural inhibitor is not present in animal sera except chimpanzee serum, it has a low titer, and it elutes in gel chromatography with monomeric albumin. The preS2epitope is masked in vivo either partially or completely, depending on the HBsAg titer. Purified HBsAg contains closely bound albumin. In vitro, preS2 does not bind normal human serum albumin, but it binds glutaraldehyde modified monomeric albumin. We suggest that a small subtraction of albumin (approx. 10 pmol/rnl ) is modified in vivoin a way binds to the surface of hepatitis B VIruS. Transactivation has recently been demonstrated for certain pathogenic and transforming viruses. This finding raised the question whether a transactivating mechanism is implicated in HBV associated malignant transformation. In the experiments reported here we focused on the HBx gene whose function is still unknown. The HBx gene was cloned and expressed in an SV 40 expression vector as well as under the control of the HBs gene promoter. After cotransfection with plasmids containing the bacterial CAT gene being expressed either by viral (SV40, MMTV, HTL V I, RSV) or cellular promoters (thymidine kinase) a transactivation was demonstrated. Interestingly, a single copy of HBV DNA was found to be sufficient for transactivation in cells of appropriate specificity. As we could show for the hepatoma Ul, an integrated HBV DNA sequence (U1.4) connected to human DNA sequences also caused transactivation, showing a considerably stronger transactivating effect than the HBx gene alone. It is therefore concluded that a positive feedback effect on the x promoter is exerted by the HBx gene product. Further investigations will have to demonstrate whether the mechanism described is indeed involved in the process of malignant transformation.",

Geflii gelkrankheiten, D\u00b76300 Giessen So far, avian hepatitis B viruses have been detected only in Pekin ducks. Two isolates (DHBV 3 and 16) have been cloned and sequenced. Aimof this study was (i) to characterize supposedly hepatocarcinogenic DHBVisolates of brown spotted ducks of China, and (ii) to investigate whether DHBV related viruses exist in other avian species. A large number of sera from different avian species was tested by DNA spot hybridisation for the presence of DHBV related viral DNA. Positive signals were obtained with sera from Chinese ducks, German geese and herons. Several isolates were cloned, sequenced, and the host range was determined by infection of German ducks and geese. The analysis revealed a close relatedness of all avian hepadna viruses derived from ducks or geese, and no indication for a major genetic difference of Chinese DHBV isolates which could explain its putative hepatocarcinogenic property. DHBVfrom geese and Pekin ducks did not show species specific sequence differences and were infectious in both avian species. In contrast, the heron hepatitis B virus sequence is highly divergent from DHBV. Preliminary results suggest that this virus is not infectious in ducks or geese.",

            "text": "The Hepadna virus P-open reading frame probably codes for the virus associated polymerase. Until now, however, P-frame sequence specific antisera, which react with fullength P-frame products synthesized in vitro, were unable to detect authentic in vivo P-proteins in virions or in intracellular viral cores. Alternatively, the enzymatic activity can be used to monitor and characterize the viral polymerase. Conditions could be found to open viral cores such that they are permeable to macromolecules but fully retain polymerase activity. After restriction enzyme digestion, only fragments carryingthe protein covalently bound to the viral minus strand remain associated with the opened cores and can be labelled by the endogenous reaction. The viral polymerase did not accept any of a number of exogenous templates. This tight association with endogenous template and/or core is an unusual property of the DHBV polymerase. To obtain diagnostic reagents for the detection of acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure, we have expressed viral antigens representing gag and env proteins. The vectors preferentially used had been constructed for expression of large quantities of fused proteins in E. coli (Gene Anal. Techn. .3 (1986) 53-57). The plasmid carries the E. coli lac promotor and portions of the E. coli lac Z gene. Stable fusion proteins were electrophoretically transfered and incubated with HIV-antibody positive human sera. Reactive bands were compared with those from immunoblots done with proteins of gradient purified virions; the results of Western blotting with the fusion proteins containing epitopes of gag pl5, pl 7, p24, and env gp4l were at least as sensitive as with conventional ELISA, immunofluorescence, immunoblot, and commercially available EL-ISA-tests based on recombinant proteins. Several examples with critical sera emphasized the reliability of Western blots with bacterially expressed proteins. Anti HIV-l was found in drug addicts in 1986 in 30-40% (71 of 236 males and 58 of 130 females) and in 85 out of 166 haemophiliacs (51%). Using LAV-2 from L. Montagnier we established an anti HIV-2 ELISA assay and for confirmation an indirect immunofluorescence assay and Westernblot test. -Until now we have screened more than 120 drug addicts, only one showed anti HIV-l and a reaction with gp36 of HIV-2. Of till' 70 haernophiliacs screened for anti HIV-2, two anti HIV-1 containing sera showed also staining of gp36. Presently nobody can determine if this kind of reaction with the gp36 is due to a double infection of these patients with HIV-l and 2, or if this is caused by immunological cross-reaction of anti gp41 with the glycoprotein of HIV-2.",

            "text": "Detection of Antibodies to HIV II (LAV II) in German-and West-African Patients by Immunofluorescence and Immunoblotting SC H M IT Z, H. and A. ME YER Virol. Abt., Bernhard-Nocht-Inst., 0 -2000 Hamburg 4 The HIV II obtained from Dr. L. Montagnier was cultivated in different T-cell-lines (CEM, Molt-4). Using the indirect immunofluorescence-technique cross-reactivity of the sera of 227 patients with HIV I infections with HIV II infected CEM-cells was found in about 10%. In contrast all sera with HIV II infection showed a strong reaction to both HIV I and HIV II antigens. The specificity of the immune reaction was controlled by crossabsorption techniques, using either HIV I or HIV II infected T cell-lines. In the immunoblot anti-HIV II positive sera reacted with all gag-proteins of HIV 1. Our preliminary results with sera from Africa and from Germany show that predominantly African people are involved in this infection. Since solid phase peptide synthesis was introduced by Merrifield, this method has been established in many laboratories and synthetic peptides have become widespread in their use in natural and medical science. In particular, synthetic peptides were used as specific antigens in diagnostic test systems for the detection of antibodies in patient sera. Monospecific or monoclonal antisera against peptide sequences can be raised in animal systems and are used for the characterization and identification of the native polypeptides in cellular and molecular systems and have proven to' be of great value in immunological test systems. Chemical methods for synthesis were considerably improved and adapted to automated systems which allow high yields of the respective products. The consecutive purification steps however are still very expensive and time consuming. For the use in ELISAor RIA tests and for antibody production peptides need to be coupled again to plastic or protein supports which may lead to the destruction of secondary structure and a loss of antigenicity. To avoid these problems we have developed a system where side-chain protection groups can be removed without simultaneous cleavage of the synthesized peptide from polystyrene supports. Peptides from EBV and HIV-specific proteins were synthesized and used in very sensitive ELISA tests to screen patients' sera for specific antibodies. In addition, the carrierbound peptides were shown to be potent antigens for raising antibodies in immunized animals. We have studied cellular immune responses against two synthetic peptides from the latent membrane antigen (BNLFI-MA) of the Epstein Barr virus, a possible candidate for LYD-MA, (\"lymphocyte detected membrane antigen\"). The two peptides represent the amino acids 42-53, expressed on the cell surface, and 69-S1 situated in the interior of the cell. Five of 15 EBV-positive persons reacted well in a lymphocyte proliferation assay with BNLFlI 42-53; however, 2 of 3 EBV-negative individuals also showed borderline reactions. Surprisingly the peptide BNLFI/69-SI showed a strongly antiproliferative effect. Thus, the sequence 42-53 seems to playa role for the recognition of EBV infected lymphocytes by specific T-cells, although an unspecific stimulatory effect of this sequence cannot be ruled out. The biological significance, if any, of the strong inhibitory effect of the BNLF1I69-S1 peptide is at present not clear. Recently we were able to show that surface density of class I HLA antigens on Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells is reduced in comparison to EBV-transformed peripherallymphoblastoid cell lines of the same patients. Additionally, qualitative differences between BL and LCL cells were detected. In this paper we present data on class I RNA in the same cell lines. -Northern blots of total and poly A+ RNA with a HLA class I eDNA probe revealed one HLA class I transcript of about 2kb in BL as well as in LCL cells. Differences in size of transcripts in BL and LCL cells not detected. -Using slot-blot analysis of total and poly A+ RNA with the same HLA class I eDNA probe and scanning of autoradiograms we could show that RNA data confirmed the previous protein data: expression of HLA class I antigens in BL cells is lower than in LCL cells and down regulation occurs on the transciptionallevel. However, this effect is not a direct viral effect as it is also detected with EBVnegative BL cells. The relevance of this phenomenon for the failure of immune surveillance in patients developing Burkitt's lymphoma has to be proven by further experiments. Treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of patients with chronic active hepatitis B and healthy donors resulted in increased interferon gamma production. PBL were purified by Ficoll-Paque and adjusted at 5 X 10 6 cells/m!.Interferon was measured by a highly sensitive enzym-immunoassay. Addition of interferon alpha resulted in interferon gamma production in a dose dependent manner. Maximal interferon gamma activities were obtained on day 3 by incubation with 1000 U/ml interferon alpha. However, only 60% of interferon levels exhibited in healthy donors was observed in patients. Coincubation with antibodies to interferon alpha or gamma led to undetectable amounts of interferon in the supernatants. Taken together these observations remain to be noted when considering the use of interferon alpha in therapy of chronic active hepatitis B. Cloned human Tumor Necrosis Factor was shown to activate Natural Killer cells (NK) in a dose dependent manner in various systems. In vivo the nature of NK cells was defined by pretreatment of mice with the NK specific antibody anti-Asialo GM-1. Whereas peritoneal exsudate cells showed less or no NK activity human peripheral blood cells resulted in significantly increased cytotoxic capacity due to NK cells. However, in all systems we failed to detect any interferon in turn to TNF treatment. Thus the addition or injection of both compounds yielded in additive amounts of NK activity. It is therefore concluded that TNF is able to exibit immunmodulatory capacities similary to those of interferons, hence there is no molecular defined homology of both compounds. Anti-Golgi autoantibodies were recently described in both human patients suffering from autoimmune diseases (1; 2) and in mice bearing a certain tumor (3). During our studies of the mouse system we demonstrated that it was not the tumor ifself which induced anti-Golgi autoantibodies but a transmissible agent found to be associated with progressor-Mo-MSV transformants that had been serially passaged in vivo (4). Here we report further characterization of the causative agent and show, that it possesses properties characteristic of lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV), such as morphology of non-arbo togaviruses, capacity to elevate plasma LDH levels, restriction of replication to a subpopulation of murine macrophages (probably the la subset), extremely high serurn-titres (lOll IDsolml) during the acute phase of infection and lifelong viraemia. -The nature of the autoantigens awaits further characterization as well as the regulation of the induction phase of the autoimmune response.

Furthermore, in 2 of 5 serum samples of patients with chronic HBV infection and in 9 of 20 serum samples of patients with acute HBV infection HBx-antibodies could be demonstrated. In 67 control sera an antibody reactivity with the viral X-protein was found only in one case. To further examine the specificity of the antibody reactivity against HBx\u00b7protein immunoprecipitation and competition experiments were performed. The antibody reactivity against MS-2-X could be competed by~-GAL-X, which demonstrates the specificity of HBx\u00b7antibodies. The summary of data indicates that antibodies against HBx-protein are present in approx. 25% of Hepatitis Bpatients. Titer risesare found already in the early course of infection. A prognosis to the outcomeof infectionhowevercan not be concluded from the presence of HBx-antibodies. By cotransfection of cloned, plasmid-integrated HBV-or DHBV-DNA (dimer genomes) and a neomycine (neo) resistence confering plasmid more than 100 nco-resistent HepG2 clones containing chromosomally integrated viral DNA were obtained. Cell culture media and cell extracts were tested for viral proteins by radioimmunoassay and immunoblot analyses; secretion of virus particles, replicative intermediates, integrated und extrachromosomal viral DNA were analysed by Southern-blot analyses. Five cell lines with different expression patterns of viral antigens were obtained. Virus productin could be demonstrated for two of these clones. Extrachromosomal supercoiled HBV DNA, which serves as template for synthesis o\u00a3\"the RNA pregenome in vivo, could not be identified. This result suggests that integrated viral DNA can serve as template in vitro. For none of the clones transfected with DHBV DNA virus production could be demonstrated. It is therefore conceivable that intracellular factors contribute to the host and cell specificity of hepadna viruses. Using the HepG2 cell system it should be possible to identify such factors, and to elucidate mechanisms of gene expression and replication in more detail.",

            "text": "LIANG, X._H. 2 The diagnostic relevance of antibodies against the X protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is subject to controversy. We analysed HBsAg positive serum samples (n = 55) of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for the presence of anti-X antibodies. In an immunoblot two X-fusion proteins (~-gal-X and MS2-X) served as substrate. Positive reactions with both fusion proteins were obtained with four of the 55 sera examined. Specificity of reactions was confirmed by competition experiments. The low fraction of anti-X positive sera excludes anti-X antibodies as a general marker for HCC. In all four anti-X positive sera the antibody titer against the X-protein was higher as the one against the nucleocapsid antigen and in one case anti-X activity was detectable even at a 1:50,000 dilution. It is conceivable that high anti-X antibody titers in some HCC patients are related to X gene expression in tumor tissue. Little is known about proteins encoded by the X-open reading frame of the human Hepatitis B virus. To identify x-related proteins and antibodies recognizing x-protein, several expression plasmids were constructed which allow expression of different parts of the xframe in E. colias fusion proteins and the elucidation of antibodies against various x-related protein sequences. In addition 35S-labelled x-protein was synthesized from the first AUG in the x-gene sequence by in vitro transcription and translation using the SP6-Polymerase. The resulting x-protein of 154 aa was used to assay for x-specific antibodies. Using both approaches, x-specific antibodies were detected in particular in sera from patients with prim-ary liver carcinomas, and also in a few sera of patients with HBV-induced liver cirrhosis. Therefore we expect that sequences of the x-open reading are being expressed during the HBVlife cycle. -When liver specimens from HBV-infected patients were screened in Western blots for the presence of x-encoded protein(s), one of our x-specific antibodies was found to recognize a protein with a molecular weight of about 22 kd. This protein differs in its size from the one expected for a conventionallyexpressed x-frame (17 kd) and also in size and occurrence from a 28 kd protein with x-antigenicity detected in several primary liver carcinomas by Moriarty et al.",

Biochemie, D-8033 Martinsried ln this study we examined whether there is a counterselection for viral replication and core gene expressio n in PLC tissue of woodchucks similar as known for human PLC tissue. The expression of WHcAg and Pre-S proteins was tested with antibodies against the corresponding proteins expressed in E. coli by immunoblot analyses. The molecular forms of the viral DNA (integrated and extrachromosomal, methylatedand unmethylared) was analysed by Southern blot-and restriction enzyme digestion. In most of the WHY PLC tissues no or very little WHcAg expression was found. This indicates that also in WHY infected PLC tissue WHcAg expression is often abolished although less frequently as in human PLC tissues. The integrated but not the extrachromosomal WHY DNA was often found methylated which may contribute to core gene inactivation. In contrast to WHcAg, Pre-S1 and Pre-S2 expressionwas always observed in chronically infected and often in PLC tissues. In some of the PLC tissues there was predominant expression of Pre-S1. The altered expression of the Pre-S proteins in PLC tissue may contribute to the reduced viremia in some of these animals. The mechanism which lead to the altered Pre-S expressio n in these tissues remains to be determined. The BHx open reading frame (ORF) was cloned into the SV40 based expression vector pKSV1 0 and cotransfected with a plasmid expressing the CAT gene under control of the SV40 early promoter. The results indicate transactivation by a product of the BHx gene.We also tested the integrated HBV DNA sequences U1.4 and U1.5 cloned from the human hepatoma tissue U1. In cotransfection experiments with plasmids expressing the CAT gene under control of the SV40 promoter and the LTRs of HTLV I and MMTV, respectively, transactivation can be demonstrated. By cloning sequences 5 of the HBx ORF in front of the CAT ORF we could identify a promoter signal which might control HBx gene expression in infected liver cells. A transactivating effect on the HBx promoter was observed by the HBV DNA integrate Ul.4, in which the HBx gene is cotranscribed with flanking cellular sequences. Further investigations will be necessary to clarify whether transactivation is a mechanism of HBV induced oncogenesis. From epidemiological studies infection of hepatocytes with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is known to enhance the frequency of developing a hepatocellular carcinoma. To date no evidence demonstrates a particular intramolecular cis-influence of integrated HBV DNA on adjacent cellular sequences. We therefore consider a trans-regulation by HBV DNA as alternative mechanism of HBV related tumorigenesis. -Here we describe a transactivating function of HBV DNA. It was found by the stimulation of chloramphenicol-acetyl-transferase (CAT) activity after cotransfection with cloned HBV DNA. This transactivation depends on the expression of sequences of the HBV X region. It is performed even by a single copy of HBV DNA. In surveying different isolated promoters for effects by HBV DNA we observed transactivation of the promoters of the HSV TK gene and the LTRs of RSV, HTLVI and MMTV. -In the light of these results it is very likely that transactivation by HBV DNA is also performed in HBV infected hepatocytes. It might well be that also cellular genes important in transformation are deregulated by this mechanism. Max v. Pettenkofer Inst., Univ., D-8000 Miinchen I Inst. Virology, Chin. Nat. Acad. of Science Hepatitis B and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) cause chronic active disease and are linked with neoplasia of man. The question needs to be discussed whether prevention of primary infection is a practical approach to controlling severe disease. Strategies for possible vaccination will depend on the epidemiological situation. In the case of controlled immunosuppression prior vaccination of virusfree individuals would require extremely safe products for vaccination. For Hepatitis B such a product, produced in yeast, is already commercially available and in use. For EBV this approach is not successful as yeast-specific glycosylation patterns destroy viral antigenicity. We have expressed selected parts of the EBV genome in mammalian cells and have obtained a product with good yield and authentic antigenicity. The possible use of this product will also require appropriate adjuvants. For areas with high natural risk for tumor development such as several areas of Africa, Southeast Asia and Southern China in particular (accumulated risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma of about 1% each), vaccines causing effective long-term imrnuni-ty and inexpensive, simple and safe application would be required. Starting from the long proven, very safe Chinese vaccinia strain Tien-Tan we have constructed a recombinant vaccinia strain which includes both EBV membrane and Hepatitis B surface antigens. Both antigens are expressed at high levels. and 0% of persons without risk (n = 13). -Antibody analysis of Ig(sub)classes showed a restriction to IgG 1 (found in 100% of Hl'V-seropositives) and IgG 3 (about 50%) in blood serum and to IgG 1 in cerebrospinal fluid. IgG 2 and IgG 4 antibodies could be detected in 2 respectively 1 case. HIV specific IgA antibodies could not be detected and IgM antibodies only in one case, in which a seroconversion was observed. HIV specific IgM could also be found in cerebrospinal fluids of two patients with incipient cerebral symptoms. These results were confirmed by the Western blot technique. -Basing on routine laboratory diagnosis of serum antibodies to HIV-1 in the years 1985 and 1986, the monthly detection rate of infection amounts to 50 persons on average. The relation of female to male persons changed from 1:7 to 1:3 during a year. This might be influenced by a screening programme performed with female prostitutes, who are found seropositive in about 2.5%. The clinical examination of HIV infected patients admitted to the City Hospital of Offenbach/FRG revealed striking signs in about 35-40%, of AIDS in 6%. The infected persons belong to risk groups. In December 1986 the first case of HIV-2 infection was recorded. (1986) 666-667) contains human endogenous retroviral sequences related to Simian Sarcoma Associated Virus (SSAV). Nucleotide sequencing of the S71 pol region shows the presence of a 1 kb reading frame distinctly related to the 3 carboxyterminal half of the reverse transcriptase of the murine leukemia virus AKV. This region also includes the putative RNase H domain. An amino acid identity of 54% as well as conservation of 60% of the proline positions points to a high degree of homology between the AKV and the S71 pol sequence. Moreover, protein secondary structures calculated for both sequences agree up to 66%, the highest degree of structural conservation being in the RNase H domain. Structural elements found in this region also seem to be conserved in a number of retroviral RNase H domains. We are currently isolating S71 cDNA clones indicating that this sequence may also be expressed in human tissue.",

A drastic reduction in the transcriptional activity of the c-fgr proto-oncogene could be observed in RSV infected CEC compared to uninfected CEC. The transcription rates of c-fosand c-mycwere also reduced but to a lesser extent. From the experiments with a temperature-sensitive, transformationdefective mutant of RSV, we conclude that the alterations observed were caused by the viral infection and are not due to the process of transformation. were determined. -Transformation of the condyles was not followed by alterations of ALP activity in comparison to uninfected controls. Further, uptake and deposition of radiolabelled Ca was similar in both, transformed and control condyles. In contrast, autoradiographic analysis revealed an irregular pattern of bone matrix mineralization in the virus-transformed tissue, similar to that observed histologically. -The data indicate that morphological alterations observed in virus-induced osteosarcomagenesis in vitro are not associated with alterations in Ca uptake or ALP activity, however, bone matrix mineralization follows the irregular pattern of the transformed tissue. In Xiphophorus, melanoma formation was assigned by classical genetic findings to the expression of a cellular oncogene, named Tu. Tu was proposed to be negatively controlled by cellular anti-oncogenes or regulatory genes (R). The molecular nature of Tu and R is unknown so far. In order to contribute to an understanding of the molecular biological basis of melonoma formation, we are attempting to isolate and characterize the oncogene Tu. We have identified a restriction fragment length polymorphism associated with Tu. In addition we are analyzing the structure and expression of known proto-oncogenes in various mutants of Xiphophorus affecting melanoma formation. During embryogenesis c-src and e-ras 3 expression peaks during organogenesis, while c-sis expression elevates later, suggesting a function more related to cellular differentiation than to proliferation. In adults, e-ras 1 and 2 are expressed tissue specifically and show no over-expression in tumorous tissue, while e-ras 3, c-src and c-mycdemonstrate enhanced expression in melanoma. c-erb B 1,2 and c-sis are expressed only in tumor cells. These data suggest a coordinated deregulation of several oncogenes during the process of melanoma formation and/or progression. Serum-deprivation of the PSM melanoma cells leads to up to 10 fold elevated levels of c-erb B 1, c-src and e-ras 2 mRNAs. Normal levels are restored within 48 h after stimulation. Serum-deprivation of the A2 embryonic cells results in a total loss of c-one gene expression without reconstitution after 48 h. This demonstrates rhar the expression of thesec-one genes in melanomacells is not related to proliferation in general but may instead have tumor specific features. Murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) isolated from normal and irradiated bone tissue, from spontaneous benign and malignant bone tumors, and from radiation-induced osteosarcomas, as well as the endogenous ecocropic leukemia virus of the AKR mouse (Akv) , previously reported to be non-oncogenic, are capable of inducing osteomas and osteopetrosis together with malignant lymphomas in NMRI mice. The latent periods vary from 6-18 months. -Histological examination of the virus-induced bone tumors showed marked differences in the sizes of the cell layers of the periosteum, in the degree of crypt formation into the mineralized osseous tissue, and in the number of metabolically activeosreoblasts. -Restriction mapping of the different virus genomes showed great similarities to that of Akv, but differences in the structure of the glucocorticoid regulatory elements (GRE) and enhancer sequences of the LTR regions. The latter exhibited distinct effects on Dexamethasone-induced CAT activity in NIH3T3 cells. In osteoblastcell lines, Dexamethasoneinduced Cat activity correlated also with the Dexamethasone-induced increase of osteoblastic differentiation. However, the different LTR structures could not yet be associated with either bone tumor incidences or with the different latent periods observed with the various virus types. We have previously shown that the sponge is the first organismin phylogenesis to contain the ancestral c-src gene. A genomic llbrary of Spongilla lacustris has been prepared, screened for u-src related sequences, and preliminary sequencing results from one clone indicates homology at the nucleotide and amino-acid level to the v-src gene. Interestingly, hybridization data suggest that the sponge c-src gene may shorter than that of higher eukaryotes by virtue of an internal region of the gene being missing. This observation is consistent with data on the sponge src protein (Angelika Barnekow, pers. comrn. ) showing a smaller c-src protein product, possibly due to deletion of a region of the protein corresponding to the missing DNA sequence. -As Hydra is the first organismin phylogenesis with differentiated nerve cells, we are using src-related clones isolated from a Hydra genomic bank to study the neuron-specific expression of c-src. -On t he basis of DNA hybridization, the proto-oncogene yes is first detected in lower chordates. From a genomic bank of Kiphophorus maculatus we have isolated src-and yes-related clones that may represent an early stage in the srclyes gene duplication/divergence process.",

At early times post infection, largeT was presentmainly in the nucleoplasm and at the cellular chromatin: Concomitant with the onset of viral DNA replication, the amount of nuclear matrix associated large T increased drastically. During further course of infection the amounts of both chromatin and nuclear matrix associated large T increased steadily, paralleling the increase in viral DNA synthesis. The biological significance of this correlation was corroborated by analysis of cells infected with the SV40 tsA-mutant tsA5S. At the restrictive temperature, tsA-58-mutant large T failed to initiate viral DNA replication in infected cells, and also failed to associate with the cellularchromatin and the nuclear matrix. By blocking viral DNA synthesis with aphidicolin, we were able to show that the accumulation of large T at these nuclear structures does not result from binding of large T to viral chromatin, but reflects an association with cellular components of the chromatin and the nuclear matrix. Fish Lymphocystis Disease Virus (FLDV), a member of the iridovirus family, causes a widely distributed disease in pleuronectes, which is characterized by papilloma-like lesions. A thymidine kinase gene (tk) activity has been reported for two members of the family iridoviridae namely Frog Virus 3 and FLDV. The identification of the tk gene loci in FLDV genome was performed by transformation of 3T3 TK negative to 3T3 TK positive cells using specific viral DNA sequences and transfection assay (calcium phosphate technique). DNA fragments of the viral genome used in this study were obtained from a defined gene library of FLDV genome containing the complete viral DNA sequences. The selection of the converted cells was carried out under the condition of HAT selection procedure. The results of these experiments revealed that the EcoRl FLDV DNA fragment C (10.9 kbp; 0.611 to 0.718 mu) is able to transform 3T3 TK negative to 3T3 TK positive cells. Additional experiments which were performed using the subclone of EcoRl DNA fragment C revealed that the DNA sequences (4.7 kbp) mapped at the coordinates 0.663 to 0.718 of FLDV genome possess the transformation ability, indicating that the tk gene loci is located in this particular region. -The determination of the nucleotide sequences of this interesting gene is in progress now.",

Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies obtained after immunization with infectious poliovirus recognize only conformation dependent epitopes and do not react with isolated polypeptides. Recently, we have obtained three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies usingan appropriate in vitro immunization system of spleen cells primed in vivo with purified VPl. These antibodies recognized also isolated VPl. The antibody binding sites were located between amino acid residues 93-104 of VPl. We have used one of these antibodies for the selection of neutralization escape mutants. All mutants isolated had an altered VP1 as revealed by isoelectric focusing in urea. From 16 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognizing conformation dependent epitopes 5 could neither neutralizenor bind these mutants. We conclude that the region of amino acid residues 93-104 of VP1 is also involved in the formation of the epitopes of this group of antibodies, probably as part of a discontinuous epitope. The major antigenic determinant of foot-and mouth disease virus has been located within the region from amino acid 144 to 159 on coat protein VPl. A synthetic peptide representing this region can protect guinea pigs againstviral infection. Immune affinity chromatography using this synthetic peptide eliminates> 90% of the neutralisingactivity of a hyperimmune serum. To investigate the antigenic determinant in more detail, neutralising monoclonal antibodies (McAb) were raised against complete virus and against the synthetic peptide.These McAbscould be dividedinto 4 neutralisation groups. The bindingsitesof the McAbs were localized by different methods e.g. Western blot, ELISA and competition experiments. 2 of the groups of McAbs' bound to the synthetic peptide, isolated VP1 and viral particles and binding could be inhibited completely by the peptide. The McAbs of the two other groups bound only to complete viral particles and weakly to the peptide. -To correlate the different neutralisation pattern with the primary structure of the coat protein VP1 , the nucleotide sequences coding for the antibody bindingsites were determined for all FMDV strains tested. In conclusion this analysis demonstrated that McAbs from the first two groups recognize overlapping sequential epitopes, whereas the McAbs from the two other groups recognize conformational epitopes. -To support these findings, escaped mutants were selected from all McAb groups and sequenced. The results obtained showed amino acid exchanges in the antibody binding site in VP1 in the case of the McAbs which recognize the sequential epitopes. In contrast, in the other cases, amino acid exchanges were only found in the two other coat proteins VP2 and VP3, which by themselves do not induce neutralising antibodies. FMDV serves as a model system for structural and functional analyses during the translation process. Translation initiates atypically for eucaryotes at an internal start site approx. 1300 nucleotides downstream from the 5' end of the RNA. We have shown that deletion or insertion mutations in large parts of this so called 5' non coding region affect strongly the efficiency of translation initiation. A hot spot region for mutagenesis, also for point mutations is a pyrimidine-rich stretch 15 bp in front of the LOth AUG, which functions as the start codon. There is evidence that ribosomes bind directly to this initiation site. -The whole non coding region is marked by a high degree of secondary structure and by the ability to bind several cytoplasmic factors. With the help of protein RNA binding assays we are trying to analyse factors which are involved in this process. Using cloned coxsackievirus B3 eDNA as an enteroviral diagnostic reagent, an in situ hybridization assay has been developed, which detects the main etiologic agents of viral heart disease in a single hybridization assay including coxsackie B and A viruses as well as echoviruses. Endomyocardial biopsies from 46 patients with clinically suspected myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy have been examined together with myocardial tissue from recipient hearts of 9 patients who underwent heart transplantation. Enteroviral infected myocardial cells have been detected in 6 of 21 patients with suspected myocarditis as wellas in 4 of 17 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, including 2 recipient hearts with positive hybridization. 17 patients with myocardial diseases not consistent with suspected viral heart disease -e.g., coronary heart disease, were used as an internal control group and showed negative hybridization. An important observation is that the number of infected myocardial cells is correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms. Interestingly, positivehybridization for enteroviral RNA was also obtained in late biopsies -e.g., 6 months after onset of the disease, indicating persistence of the virus in human myocardium. From 21 cases (14 m, 7 f) with sudden infant death (SIDS) and 2 cases with near-SIDS (both male, one died) we tried to isolate virus. The mean age was 4 months (0.7-10). Six infants had been immunized with oral polio vaccine, six had not been immunized, and the vaccination history of 11 was not known. The following specimens were examined: lung: 21; intestine: 20; brain: 12; heart: 4; trachea: 1; CSF: 1; spleen: 1. Isolations were attempted in primary monkey kidney cells, in human embryonic lung fibroblasts, and in HeLa cells. (Specimens of 11 cases were examined by ELISA for influenza A/B-, parainfluenza-, adeno-and RS-antigen with negative results.) We isolated poliovirus from 6 cases (4 x type 2, 1 x type 3, 1 X types 1+ 3) and one untyped enterovirus. The agents were detected in the intestine, once with poliovirus 2 isolated in the absence of a vaccination history. In one case, however, poliovirus 2 was isolated from the lung, when oral polio vaccinations had been done 6 and 4 months prior to SIDS.",

Only in the latter case, we did find elevated levels of T-p53 complexes and additionally free p53. We therefore conclude that the amount of T-p53 complexes is determined by the amount of p53. Sucrose gradient analysis showed that in cells with limiting amounts of p53, free T-antigen and T-p53 complexes exist in predominantly high oligomeric forms. When high levels of p53 are present, lower molecular weight T-p53 complexes were also found. Free T-antigen was predominantly found in low oligomeric forms whereasfree p53 rapidly formed high oligomers. We assume that p53 bindspreferentially to an already oligomeric T-antigen, but when present in high concentrations it also binds to lower molecular weight forms of T-antigen. Max v.

The proteins were purified by partial precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. Thesepurifiedantigens were tested in ELISA with 100 human sera and the resultswere compared to those of immunofluorescence tests (IF). We were able to show a good correlation between anti-Ve A IgG and IgM in IF and anti-p150 IgG and IgM in ELISA as well as anti-EA IgGin IFand anti-p54 IgG in ELISA. Anti-EA IgM in IF were not tested. Low values of specific IgA against p150 and p54 were found mostly be sera which showed borderline titers in the IF against anti-VCA and anti-EA. Most of the studies on unmethylated or in vitro methylated viral promoters and their expression were based on transient expression assays. It was, therefore, mandatory to fix in an integrated form methylated or unmethylated viral promoters in conjunction with indicator genes in the genome of mammalian cells and to test levels of expression. BHK21 hamster cells were cotransfected with the pSV2-neo construct and the plasmid pAd2E2A-CAT which contained the E2A promoter of adenovirus type 2 DNA. G418-resistant cell lines were selected that carried the intact E2A-CAT promoter construct in which these sequences were not rearranged. Of the 18 lines generated by transfecting unmethylated DNA (urn), 17 lines expressed the CAT gene. Of the 12 lines generated by transfecting methylated pAd2E2A-CAT DNA (m), 5 lines did not express the CAT gene, 5 lines expressed it weakly, 2 linesexpressed the CATgene strongly. In the m cell lines which expressed the CAT gene to varying extents, the late E2A promoter had become partly or completely demethylated.

Immunologie, Univ., 0-200 0 Hamburg 20 Rabbit IgG antibodies specific for poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney) were used to raise antiidiotopes in guinea-pigs.These antibodies reacted specifically with anti-poliovirus IgG in an ELISA. Furthermore, binding of the anti-idiotopes to anti-poliovirus rabbit IgG was completely inhibited by poliovirus. This suggests that anti-idiorypic antibodiesrecognized determinants on anti-poliovirus antibodies whichare related to the site of poliovirus binding. Reduced competition was observed using heterologous anti-poliovirus antibodies from rats or mice. Anti-idioropes induced an immune response in rabbits or mice which was specific for poliovirus. All antisera recognized poliovirus in an ELISA to different degrees, however, they did not neutralize the virus. It is therefore concluded that anti-idiotopes hardly become a suitable vaccine against poliovirus. The 5'terminus of picornaviral genomes is highly conserved indicating an important function for viral replication. Interestingly, the infectious recombinant eDNA plasmid pCB3-Ml obtained from molecular cloningof full-lengthreverse-transcribedcoxsackievirus B3 eDNA contains the 5'sequence CCAAAA deviating from the 5' terminal sequence UUAAAA of coxsackievirus B3 wild type RNA. Remarkably, the 5' sequence of the RNA of eDNA generated virus preparations obtained from independent transfection experiments is identical with the authentic coxsackievirus B3 RNA 5' sequence UUAAAA. Therefore, the two 5' UMP residues missing in the infectious recombinant coxsackievirus B3 eDNA must have been recaptured in the course of virus replication. We assume that the two 5' UMP residues are contributed by the uridylylated virusprotein VPg-pUU acting as a primer of RNA synthesis. The foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) proteinase 3c is involved in the posttranslational maturation of virus proteins and possibly further in the pathogenesis of the infected cell. The analysis of such proteolysis may explain the process on a molecular level. Prerequisite is a simple proteinase-specific assay. Its basics have been established by use of recombinant DNA techniques and are communicated here. Earlier work has resulted in the expression of cloned FMDV cDNA including the 3c proteinase gene by E. coli. There, an active enzyme has been produced but the protein could not be identified. In a new approach, the 3c proteinase gene was fused to the Staph. aureus protein A gene present in pRIT2T.",

The latter enables the detection of expression products by affinity to antibodies. The experiment showed that in fact protein Aspecific polypeptides were produced, however reduced in molecular weight as compared to the protein expressed from pRIT2T alone or from a construction with a truncated 3c proteinase gene. It is concluded that protein A is substrate for this enzyme and converted into products. The detection of a substrate enables one to follow the purification of active enzyme from E. coli. The serologic diagnosis of recent enterovirus infections presents a serious problem in clinical virology. A reliable serologic method would be of great clinical significance (e.g., myocarditis, type 1 diabetes). Since ELISAtests lack type specificity we looked for neutralizing IgM antibodies vs the six coxsackie (cox) B types in sera of patients. IgM was separated by two-step-column-chromatography and tested in a microneutralization test. Out of 239 patients 37% were IgM negative. 40% showed IgM antibodies vs one, 17% against two, 5% against three, and 0.4% against 5 serotypes. There is no good correlation between the serum antibody titer and IgM positivity, and the incidence of antibodies vs 1 or more cox B types does not increase with age of the patients. Heterotypic rises of IgM antibody titers could be demonstrated in a patient from whom cox B 2 had been isolated. We conclude that neutralizing antibodies against cox B viruses do not appear to persist lifelong, that heterotypic IgM boosters do occur and that IgM may persist for extended periods of time. Coxsackieviruses (cox) types B and other picornaviruses share common antigens. Even human neutralizing antibodies exhibit some cross reactions. When trying to produce monoclonal antibodies (mab) against various cox B virus types we found them to differ substantially with regard to immunogenicity. A mab against cox B4 lacked neutralizing capacity (microneutralization and plaque reduction test). Binding of this mab in a dot blot on nitrocellulose depends on the antigen preparation. It obviously binds to a type-specific internal antigen of VP1 as also shown by Western blot. Immunoblots using digested VP1s of cox B4 show several bands (V8 protease: 2; N-chlorosuccinimide: 3). A comparison with polyclonal antisera proved not possible due to antibodies against V8 protease. Competitive inhibition of binding yielded weak positive results after preincubation with mab followed by incubation with polyclonal type-specific rabbit antiserum. Murine hybridomas producing poliovirus-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were obtained from adult Balb/c mice immunized with complete infectious poliovirus type 1, Mahoney. Human B cell lines producing mAbs reractive with poliovirus type 1 were generated by transformation with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) B 95-8 of tonsillar lymphocytes from several immune donors. Both murine hybridomas and EBV-transformed cells were cloned in semisolid agarose. All neutralizing (Nt-) murine mAbs recognized and neutralized only poliovirus type 1, whereas some human Nt-rrtAbs neutralized either poliovirus type 1 and 2 or all three serotypes. MAbs reactive with poliovirus type 1 and 3 but not with type 2 were not detected. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled poliovirus type 1 with crossreactive human Nt-mAbs was inhibited competitively by preincubation of mAbs with cold poliovirus type 3 and/or 2. The RNA genome of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) is expressed as a polyprotein which is rapidly processed into the mature proteins. Two viral proteases and at least one host cell protease are involved in this cleavage reactions. Characterizing the polyprotein cleavage sites of the two viral proteases IlL' and P3c we constructed plasmids with mutations in each of these proteins. RNA derived from this plasmids by use of SP6 RNA polymerase was expressed in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate and proteins were identified by different specific antisera corresponding to nearly all parts of the polyprotein. As a result the only processing site found for the LlL' protease was the junction between L and PI. The other viral protease P3c seems to be responsible for all other cleavage sites except from the P1/P2 junction and the autocatalytic cleavage of the P1AB fusion in the viral capsid. The nucleoprotein(NP)-gene-sequences of four H 1N1 Influenza A-virus strains were compared with each other and additional known virus strains. According to our sequence data the strain NUSSRJ90/77 does not show remarkably antigenic drift in its NP-gene compared to its progenitor A/FW/1/50. The latter one had disappeared for 27 years and stayed in a yet unknown place. In the strain AlBrazil/11/78 the change of amino acid no. 291 coming from aspartate to glutamate to alanine probably results in the loss of the ability to \"rescue\" NPtemperature-sensitive mutants of fowl plaque virus in doubly infected chick embryo fibroblast cells. The NP-gene of the last strain A/CaI/10/78 shows intermediate homology between the sequences of human H 1N1 and H 3N2 strains. We report on influenza infections as established by virus isolation of patients in a general pediatric practice during the influenza season. Because it is difficult to differentiate influenza from other acute respiratory infections, influenza has to be diagnosed by virological methods. From 202 children nasopharyngeal secretions were taken for virus isolation on MDCK-cells. Identification of influenza virus was carried out with FITC labelled specific antibodies iDoller et a!', Med. Microbio!' Immuno!' 176 (1987) 27-35) . From 44 children influenza A subtype H3N2 was isolated, from 61 children influenza A subtype H1N1 and from 13 children influenza B. In 11 cases of influenza A/H1N1 O-D-phase variation was found. Three typical manifestations were observed: 1.) monophasic fever 2': 38.5\u00b0C (81.25%), 2.) biphasic fever (14.4%) and 3.) croup (4.24%). No relationship between influenza type resp. subtype and symptoms could be established. Influenza A/H3N2-activity reached its peak during the 5th and 6th week of 1985, influenza AlH1N1-activity during the 8th and 9th week, followed by an influenza B peak during 10th and 11th week.",

Since avian Influenza viruses are probably not transferred to human beings under natural circumstances, and on the other hand, human Influenza viruses cannot be transferred directly to birds, the exchange of the single segments takes place in pigs, after double infection. Pigs are probably tolerant of growth of avian and human Influenza virus strains. The nucleoprotein (NP),whose Phosphopeptid-Fingerprint is strain-specific and host cell dependent, is very likely to be responsible for the species specifity. -The following questions are being examined by sequencing and comparison of sequencesof the NP-genes of one human (Hk5), one avian (D7/4) and two porcine (Sw6, Sw127) Influenza virus strains: Are there species specific differences in the sequences of the NPgenes? -Is there an adaptation of the NPs to pigs, which would be the new host? -The present results allow the following conclusions: The sequence of the NP-gene of Hk5 possesses high homology to the Nl'vgenes of other human Influenza virus strains and is clearly different to the sequence of the l':P-gene of D7/4. D7/4 is very hornologeous to the Nl'-genes of other avian Influenza virus strains. The NP-gene of Sw6 is very similar to the NP-gene of Hk5. On the other hand, the NP-gene of Swl 27 is derived from an avian Influenza virus strain, but it shows many base exchanges, which cannot be found in D7/4 and other avian strains. -This means that, firstly, there are species specific differences in the sequences of the NP-genes, and, secondly, the NP-gene of Sw127 is derived from avian Influenza virus strains and is on its way to adaptation to pigs. Previous studies with the strain jo hannesburg/1 /66 of influenza C virus have revealed that the receptor-destroying enzyme of this virus is a neurarninate Ovacetylesterase and that Nacetyl-9\u00b70-acetylneuraminic acid (l\\ieu5,9Ac!) is a receptor-determinant for attachment of infl uenza C virus to cells. We have extended our investigation to six other strains of infl uenza C virus. All strains were found 10 contain acerylesterase. Using bovine submandibulary mucin (BSM) as substrate, the maximum variation in the enzyme activity of the different strains was tenfold. B5M and rat serum were found to prevent all strains of influenza C virus tested from agglutinating chicken red blood cells. The hemagglutination-inhibition titers determined for the different strains varied up to 10D-fold. The inhibitory activity was abolished after incubation of the inhibitors with acetylesterase. From these results we conclude (i) Neu5,9Ac2serves as a receptor determinant for all influenza C viruses; (ii) factors other than the presence of Neu5,9Ac2 also affect the binding of influenza C viruses to cell surface receptors. It differsfrom wild-type-virus Sendai-Z by a frame shift mutation at position 1598, possibly representing the rs-rnutation, The altered C-terminus is 7 aminoacids longer, which was verified by sequencingthe C-terminal tryptic peptide.-The persistently infectedcelllinesP3 and CL-E-8 release 100 timeslessvirus than acutely infectedcells. Northen blot experiments showed that the mRNAs for all viral proteins are also strongly reduced. -The tryptic peptide pattern of NP-protein from persistently infected E8-cells is slightly different from that of Sendaivirus 6/94 NP-protein, as shown by HPLC-analysis. Differenttryptic peptides are being sequenced. The NP-protein plays a central role in the regulation of viral transcription and replication. Therefore we assume that the low efficiency of virus replication is due to the alterations found in this protein. The cloned hemagglutinin gene of fowl plague virus was introduced into the baculovirus AcNPV using homologous recombination techniques. Previously, biologically activehemagglutinin was detected in cultured insect cells infected with recombinant AcNPV (Kuroda et al., EMBO]. 5 (1986) 1359-1365). To express the hemagglutinin in whole insects, we have now infected larvae of tobacco budworm iHeliothis uirescensi. The hemagglutinin was synthesized in fat body, epidermis, and trachea, but not in the gut, indicating that the recombinant virus had the same tropism as authentic Ac;-..JPV. The hemagglutinin was correctly processed in these tissues into the fragments HAl and HA 2 \u2022 Hornogenates of infected larvae exhibited hemagglutinating activity and could be used for effective immunization of chickens against fowl plague.",

The virus specific mRNAs, however, have been shown to be present for all six structural prot eins in the subacute type of infection by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization with strand specific probes. In transcription-defective at 39\u00b0C. Infectious virus could be shown in the sera of all infected mice on PID 22. Brain cells of the ts4 infected mice were cocultivated with uninfected mice brain cells (MGB) on PID 26 at 31\u00b0c' However virus released from this culture was ts in the HN-genproduct only. This finding can be explained by reversion of the transcriptionmutation and establishment of a new mutation in the HN-gen in the organism. Furthermore, there is a mutation in the second surface-antigen F. This mutation which allowed the cleavage of the inactive fusion-protein Fa to the infectious form Fj-F 2 by a cellular protease a was not ts. -After 30 days in culture a reversion of the HN-ts-mutation could be seen. These results might implicate the pressure of the immunsystem in the selection of mutants of the surface-antigens. In absence of this selection-pressure in the culture systemthe revertants become dominant. The genome of Insect Iridescent Virus Type 6 -Chilo Iridescent Virus (CIV)-was shown to be circularly permuted and terminally redundant. A defined and complete gene library of the whole CIV DNA sequences (209 kbp) was established, e. g. this gene library comprises the complete 32 EcoRI DNA fragments of the viral genome. The physical map of the viral genome was constructed for the restriction endonucleases ApaI, Asp718, BamHI, EcoRI, NcoI, PvuII, SalI, Smal, and Sphl. Although the CIV genome is linear, due to the circular permutation, the restriction maps are circular. The defined gene library of CIV DNA was used for identification of further structural and functional properties of the viral genome. Hybridization experiments and heteroduplex mapping were performed. The repetitive DNA elements were detected in the EcoRI DNA fragments H (9.8 kbp; 0.535-0.582 mu) and C (13.5 kbp; 0.909-0.974 mu). The fine mapping of these regions and hybridization experiments revealed that the DNA sequences from one flank of the EcoRI DNA fragment H (0.535-0.548 mu; 2.65 kbp) are partially homologous to a part of DNA sequences of EcoRI DNA fragment C (0.920-0.944 rnu; 5.1 kbp). The further characterization of these repetitive DNA elements by nucleotide sequencing is necessary for the understanding of the functional activity and regulatory role of these elements.",

Thirteen different monoclonal antibodies directed against antigens in HSV-1 infected cell nuclei were selected. lmmunoblotting and immunoprecipitation revealed that these antibodies belong to four different recognition groups. They react with: 1. the major DNA binding protein (ICPS, 130kd); 2. the lCP35 family; 3. the 65k DNA binding protein, these antibodies were characterized in collaboration with H. S. Marsden (Glasgow); 4. a 60kd protein, present in virions and cells. None of the antibodies neutralized HSV-1. The localization of the antigens in the nuclei were specified by immune electronmicroscopy. The lCP35 family is associated with nucleocapsids, whereas the DNA binding proteins show a patchy distribution. There is evidence that some antigens represent infected cell proteins and are not a virus constituent. The genome structure of the Fish Lymphocystis Disease Virus (FLDV) was found to be circularly permuted and terminally redundant. A defined and complete gene library corresponding to 100% of the DNA sequences of the viral genome (98 kbp) was established. Using this defined gene library, DNA-DNA-hybridization experiments and heteroduplex mapping, two repetitive DNA elements were detected which mapped at the coordinates 0.034 to 0.057 mu (a part of the EcoRl DNA fragment B; 12.7 kbp, 0.034 to 0.165 mu) and at the coordinates 0.718 to 0.736 mu (EcoRl DNA fragment M; 1.4 kbp). The nucleotide DNA sequences of the repetitive DNA element was carried out. This analysis revealed the presence of many small direct and inverted repetitions, e. g. two direct repetition boxes (TTTAAAATTTAAATTTAA) started at the nucleotide position 812 and 942 and two inverted repetitions (TTAAATTTAAATTT) at the nucleotide position 820 and 959. For the evaluation of the regulatory role of these signals the corresponding DNA sequences of the repetitive DNA elements of FLDV are now compared to the known repetitive DNA sequences of other viruses, e. g. pox-and herpesviruses. Furthermore DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed that these repetitive DNA elements are conserved in the genome of different strains and types of FLDV, indicating the importance of these DNA elements for virus progeny, e. g. virus replication and encapsidation.",

In co-transfection experiments the cloned HSY-l KOS Bam HI G fragment served as donor and genomic DNA of two ANG variants as recipients. One of these variants termed HSY-l ANG path expresses glycoprotein C (gC), the other termed C18 was a spontaneous gC negative mutant. Both ANG strains are of the syn phenotype whereas HSY-l KOS 321 is syn\". In this report we show that the syn phenotype of HSY-l strain ANG path is governed by the syn 3 locus. We present evidence that the absence of gC expression under certain genetically defined conditions is not compatible with the syn+ phenotype. We further provide evidence that the Bam HI G fragment derived from the peripherally apathogenic HSY-l KOS strain may confer apathogenicity to a pathogenic strain. In converse experiments the Bam HI G fragment of HSY-l ANG path restored pathogenicity of apathogenic subclones. From our data it could be conceived that gB is one determinant of peripheral neurovirulence of HSY-1. Using hybridization for the diagnosis of infectious diseases two major problems are radioactive probes and the detection of hybrid formation by immobilizing nucleic acids on nitrocellulose filters. Alternatively biotinylated probes were used in combination with rnicrotitration plate hybridization: 10 pg purified HCMY-DNA could be detected in comparison to filter hybridization where a 32P-labeled probe detected 100 pg and a biotinylated probe about 500 pg DNA. Selfhybridization of the biotinylated HCMY-specific probe gave a sensitivity of detection of 1 pg homologous DNA. Using sandwich hybridization on microtitration plates HCMY was detected in the supernatant of infected fibroblasts and in urine reconstituted with the virus. Microtitration plate hybridization, which has the potential of instrument based analysis, together with non-isotopic probes may lead to a better acceptance of hybridization in the clinical laboratory. pp 89 is the major product of the transcription unit iel of the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). We have reported previously that pp 89 activates viral promoters in trans. In order to analyze the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional activation, we have studied the DNA-binding capacity of pp 89. Chromatography of extracts from infected cells on calf thymus DNA cellulose showed that pp 89 interacts with DNA. This interaction was dissociated at salt concentrations between 0.3-0.6 M NaCl. pp 76, a cleavage product of pp 89, and additional minor iel proteins eluted already at low ionic strength. pp 89 lacks intrinsic affi nity for DNA, since cellular factors were required for DNA binding. These factors were identified as core histones. A role for an amino acid sequence homology in the N-terminal region of pp 89 with histone H2B in the pp 89-histone-DNA interaction is discussed.",

Microbiol., Univ., CH-3010 Bern SFV infected Aedes albopictus cells which fuse at mildly acidic pH (6.2) were used to investigate cell-cell fusion. It was shown that this polykaryon formation correlated with a decrease in cellular ATP and could be blocked by inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. However, if infectedcells-in presenceof the inhibitors -were exposed for only a short time to pH 6 (e. g. 1 min) the intracellular ATP transiently recovered and polykaryon formation occurred. Usingmicroinjection of the highly fluorescent, non permeable dye Lucifer yellow it was demonstrated that under normal conditions 90% of infectedcells had fused with their neighbours. In presence of KCN no such cell-cell fusions could be observed. Thus, it can be concluded that SFV-induced polykaryon formation requires a specific expenditure of energy and that ATP is used early in the fusion process. The antigenic structure of the E glycoprotein of Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus was studied using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). 17 epitopes were identified which have different properties with respect to serological reactivity, functional activity or topological localisation. -They were found to cluster in three antigenic domains, A, B,and C. -Most epitopes of domain A are denaturation sensitive. Low pH-induced conformational changes were localized to certain epitopes within domain A. These may play an important role for membrane fusion events in the course of virus infection. The B domain epitopes are also highly conformation-dependent, but their structure is stabilized by disulfide bridges as revealed by reduction and carboxymerhylation experiments. These disulfide bridges are probably also responsible for the protease resistant tertiary structure of domain B. Pathogenesis of the measles virus induced central nervous system (CNS) complications in man, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and post infectious measles encephalomyelitis, includes the development of a defective replication cycle and possibly the generation of autoimmune reactions. In our model of subacute measles encephalomyelitis (SAME) both these aspects have been analyzed. The histopathological abnormalities of SAME are characterized by a non-demyelinating encephalomyelitis with prominent mononuclear cell infiltrations. Molecular biological studies demonstrate a persistent measles virus infection of brain cells with all viral mRNAs present, but restriction of viral gene expression. In animals with SAME a cell-mediated immune response specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) was found. T-cell lines with specificity for MBP isolated from these rats induce encephalitis in naive recipients. These observations indicate that autoimmune reactions occur in association with a persistent measles virus in CNS tissue which may be involved in the pathogenesis of SAME in rats.",

The eDNA copy was then inserted into the pGEM vector and full-length, capped RNA transcripts were synthesized using T7 polymerase. The in vitro transcripts were translated in an reticulocyte lysate and the products analysed by immunoprecipitation with an S protein specific rabbit antiserum. The antiserum immunoprecipitated a major 136,000 molecular weight product, the expected size of the S protein.

The main feature of this infection is the destruction of the Bursa of Fabricius (B.F.). Turkey isolates are not pathogenic for chickens. There is hardly any crossreaction in neutralization tests between chicken isolates (ST 1) and turkey isolates (ST 2). Besides differences in the size of their two RNA-segments, there are differences in the protein pattern. A reassortant was produced by double infection with Cu-1 (ST 1) and 28/82 (ST 2). The larger segment of the reassortant was derived from the chicken strain Cu-1 and the smaller one coding for the virion-associated polymerase was from the turkey strain. The reassortant causes no clinical signs altough many bursal cells are infected. The bursal follicles are not totally destroyed. Therefore the pathogenic property of IBDV depends partly on the smaller segment, which codes for the RNA-polymerase. As could be shown by Western-Blot analysis an increasing number of epitopes on different protein bands can be detected during the first weeks after onset of a primary cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. After several weeks antibodies to numerous protein bands of complete virus particles could be demonstrated. In transplant recipients after reactivation additional bands and broadening of the protein bands was observed. As a result of these observations an inhibition test was developed (Arch. Viro!' 90 (1986) 41) which can be used for the differentiation between primary infections and reactivations. This test-principal might be further improved if the polyclonal human antibody tracer could be substituted by monoclonal antibodies directed to \"late epitopes\", In order to detect such \"late epitopes\" the protein-patterns obtained with sera of primary cytomegalovirus infection and of reactivations were compared by immunoblotting. From these studies it could be concluded that weak epitopes could be found preferentially on the 150 000 protein. These epitopes were only detected in sera from persons after repeated immunisation during reactivation. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) particles contain a phosphoprotein of about 65 000 (pp 65) molecular weight in the matrix. The protein is the predominant structural constituent of HCMV particles, mainly found in dense bodies of lytically infected cells. Recent clinical isolates of HCMV do not necessarily have pp 65 as an abundant component; neither do these low passage wild-type viruses have appreciable amounts of dense bodies. The humoral immune response of infected individuals against pp 65 is variable and not always detectable by Western blot analyses. The reactivity did not correlate with the clinical status; however, there was a correlation with the titre in the complement fixation test. We raised antibodies against HCMV phosphoproteins in rabbits for gene mapping and corroborated the relative immunogenic properties of HCMV proteins. Immunization with dense bodiesor with gel-purified pp65 resulted in rapid seroconversion. Taken together these experiments show that pp 65 is immunogenic and the weak antibody response in the course of natural infection is probably due to low amounts of pp 65 in wild-type virions. The genomic organization of the gene coding for pp 65 has been recently described in detail (B. Ruger et aI., J. Virol. 61 (1987) No.2 ). Several differently spliced mRNA s are transcribed from transcription unit iel of MCMV. An abundant 2.75-kb mRNA codes for the major iel protein pp 89. This pho sphoprotein is transported to the nucleus, where it is able to tr ansactivate genes. An unknown iel product is recognized by CTL in association with MHC class I gene products. After transfection of iel in L cells, it still remained unresolved whether the major iel prote in pp 89 or the product of one of the minor iel RNA species is respon sible for target formation. In order to integrate the pp89 open reading frame (orf) into vaccinia, the introns interrupting the pp89 orf were removed by site-directed mut agenesis. By cloning into the expression vector pGS 62, the pp89 orf was brought under control of a vaccinia promoter. By homologous recombination, the pp89 orf was subsequ ently integrated into vaccinia. Irnmunopr ecipitation revealed the expr ession of pp89 and its 76kD processing product in cells infected with the vaccinia-pp89 orf recombinant. The nuclear localization was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence. A cloned line of IE-specific CTL recognized vaccinia-pp89 orf infected target cells. Therefore, conclusive evidence could be obt ained that a regulatory nonstructural herpes viral prot ein gives rise to a membrane antigen detected by CTL.",

Microbiol., Univ., D-6500 Mainz Recently, we described the replication of strains of HSV-1 in the adrenals of mice, independantly of the degree of their neuropathogenicity (Arch. Virol. 90 (1986) 207). Therefore, we postulated two types of tropism. Moreover, corticoid hormone levels were increased in the serum. Strains of HSV-2 however replicated less well in the adrenals, some strains lacked this replication completely. We now succeeded in isolating 2 variants from the strain ER, one replicates very well, the other only to a low degree in the adrenals. Therefore, a third type of tropism emerged. Both variants were isolated after several passages along the adrenals and plaque purified. Both lines are stable. We tested other properties of replication in macrophages, Vero-cells, corticoidal cells, type of CPE, replication in the ovaries-and the uterus, determined the i, p. and i. c. LDso's. The proteins were labelled with 35S-methionine and 3H-mannose. DNA was cut with RE and analyzed in agarose gels. The strong replication in the ovaries and the uterus seems to correlate to the higher susceptibility of female mice to HSV. The HSV-1 strain HFEM is apathogenic for the tree shrew and mice by the intraperitoneal (IP) route due to a deletion in the genome coordinates 0.762-0.789. Insertion of the BamHI DNA fragment B (0.738-0.809 mu) or of the MluI DNA fragment (coordinates 0.7615-0.789) molecularly cloned from the virulent HSV-1 strain F restored the IP pathogenicity to strain HFEM. Stable intratypic recombinant virus was established, virulent for both animals, indicating that the viral DNA sequences involved in the IP pathogenicity of HSV-1 is located within the genome coordinates 0.761-0.796. The determination of the nucleotide sequence flanking the deletion in the genome of the avirulent HSV-1 HFEM and the corresponding region of the genome of the virulent recombinant virus RMIC1 was carried out and compared to the DNA sequences of the virulent wild type HSV-l. This analysis revealed the presence of open reading frames (ORF) in this region and their functional activity seem to be involved in the viral pathogenicity. The corresponding DNA sequences should be recognized differently by the cellular elements which control the development of the HSV-1 infection in the tree shrew and the mouse.",
