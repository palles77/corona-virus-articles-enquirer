When recipients received 10 blastocysts, each injected with 10 0 TCID 50 MHV-A59, three out of five recipients and four out of 14 pups from three litters became seropositive. When blastocysts were injected with 10 -5 TCID 50 MMVp, all four recipients and 14 pups from four litters remained seronegative. The mESCs replicated MHV-A59 but not MMVp, MHV-A59 being cytolytic for mESCs. Exposure of mESCs to the viruses over four to five passages but not for 6 h affected GLT. Recipients were seropositive for MHV-A59 but not for MMVp when mESCs were cultured with the virus over four or five passages. The data show that GLT is affected by viruscontaminated mESCs.",

However, besides feeder cells and blastocysts, mESCs can harbor murine pathogens (Okumura et al. 1996; Kyuwa et al. 1997) and their introduction into a mouse colony can lead to spread of infections. Due to the exchange of mESCs between laboratories worldwide the risk of transmitting mouse infectious agents may even be higher since mESCs are often not screened for viruses and contamination and infection with viruses cannot be detected on the basis of cell morphology.",

Since these studies were performed in vitro no information is available on whether transferring blastocysts which have been injected with virus-exposed mESCs to recipients affects the germline efficiency of the mESCs and if and how soon after embryo transfer the recipients and pups show specific antibodies to such viruses. This is of relevance to laboratory animal science since germline transmission (GLT) is a necessity for the production and use of transgenic mice. Also, infected mice affect the outcome of animal experiments (Fox et al. 1977; Kyriazis et al. 1979; Dempsey et al. 1986; Barthold 1986; Lussier 1988 ).",

NCTC-1469 and A9 were used for propagation of MHV-A59 and MMVp, respectively, while L929 cells were used for titration of both viruses. NCTC-1469, A9, and L929 cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4.5 g/l D-glucose/L-glutamine and 10% heatinactivated fetal calf serum (L929 in 5% fetal calf serum). Propagation of virus stocks was performed in 75 cm 2 cell culture flasks (NCTC-1469 in cell culture flasks from Corning Costar, Cambridge, Maryland, USA; A9 and L929 in cell culture flasks obtained from Nunc, Roskilde, DK) at 37\u00b0C using 5% CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere. Cultures of permissive cells were infected with the appropriate virus for 1 h followed by removal of the virus suspension and replacing it with 10 ml cell culture medium. MHV-A59-and MMVp-infected cells were frozen in their culture flasks after 20 h and 5 days, respectively. They were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles to allow release of the virus. The contents of the flasks were centrifuged at 3,000g for 5 min to separate virus from cell debris. The supernatant was passed through a Minisart \u00d2 filter having a pore size of 0.20 lm (Sartorius, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). For titration, L929 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of 2 9 10 4 /well for MHV-A59 and 3 9 10 3 /well for MMVp and cultured overnight. After removal of the culture medium, for each 10-fold dilution up to 10 -10 , 12 wells were inoculated with 100 ll of the virus. The cytopathic effect (CPE), observed as syncytia and cytolysis for MHV-A59 and detachment of cells for the MMVp infection, was determined on the second and sixth day of culture, respectively. The mean tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) for each viral stock was calculated according to the Spearman-Kaerber method (Spearman 1908; Kaerber 1931) . The MHV-A59 and MMVp stocks used in this study had titers of 10 9 and 10 4 TCID 50 /ml, respectively, and were stored at -80\u00b0C until used.",

In addition, the effect of these viruses on the GLT of the mESCs was determined. MHV and MMV were chosen since they are among the most prevalent viruses found in contemporary mouse colonies and MHV replicates in the cytoplasm while MMV replicates in the nucleus of the cell. In a first step, blastocysts were microinjected with approximately 1 nl of the viral stocks to determine whether the recipients would seroconvert and if the reproductive efficiency would become affected. The present data show that microinjection of blastocysts with titers as high as 10 9 TCID 50 MHV-A59/ml leads to seroconversion of the recipients and, in some cases, the pups also have anti-MHV antibodies, which are of maternal origin. The titer of MMVp used in this study did not lead to seroconversion of the recipients and pups did not have anti-MMV antibodies, implicating that the viral titer was too low. Due to the small volume of liquid that was injected indeed one blastocyst would have received a maximum of 1 TCID 50 MHV-A59 or 10 -5 TCID 50 MMVp and recipients would have received a maximum dose of 10 TCID 50 MHV-A59 or 10 -4 TCID 50 MMVp since 10 blastocysts were transferred to each recipient. In addition, the reproductive efficiency did not appear to be affected by the presence of the viruses, even with the high MHV dose, most likely due to short-term exposure of the blastocysts to the viruses and a lack of viral replication in the embryos or fetuses themselves. All pups examined, including those born to seropositive recipients, were free of the virus, as shown by PCR analysis.",

Even though PCR analysis detected MCMV DNA in in vitro cultured embryos none was found in the pups and the recipients (Tebourbi et al. 2002) . In contrast, Baskar et al. (1993) injected 5-20 molecules MCMV DNA into the male pronucleus of each zygote with the same technique that is used for transgenesis and transferred the resulting blastocysts to recipients. These workers reported smaller litter sizes, fetal growth retardation, embryo resorption, abnormalities, and MCMV DNA in fetal mice. In the present study, pups from a MHV-seropositive mother showed the presence of anti-MHV antibodies which decreased by d112 post embryo transfer. Unfortunately, the amount of MCMV microinjected (Tebourbi et al. 2002) and the serological status of pups and recipients were not reported.

This is supported by the finding that titers of the supernatants from the cultures with MHV-A59 were over 10 7 TCID 50 /ml, whereas titers of the supernatants from the cultures with MMVp decreased with time or there was no detectable infectious virus present at later passages.

            "text": "Rodent parvoviruses bind to surface receptors which are expressed on most cells and do not appear to integrate into host chromosomes during either lytic or persistent infections (Cornelis et al. 2004 ). Parvovirus replication in permissive cells within 20-30 h (Ward and Tattersall 1982) leads to the release of progeny virions and is usually associated with cell death. In a restrictive host culture, the viral yield from culture is always less than the multiplicity required to obtain it. Even at a very high dose of 5-10 PFU/cell, only 0.1-5% of cells are productively infected and die (Ward and Tattersall 1982) . The survivors (95-99%) continue to grow and are not infectable at the original multiplicity and therefore infections dilute out rapidly. A previous study showed restrictive infection of murine embryonal carcinoma cells (mECCs) with MMV (Miller et al. 1977) . Less than 0.1% positive nuclei were detected when cells were infected with 10 PFU/cell (Miller et al. 1977) . Blocking of replication of MMV in teratocarcinoma stem cells is not total; a small fraction of infected cells produce capsid antigen (Miller et al. 1977 ). In the present study, 6% of the cells were found to be positive for both POU5F1 and MMV at P13 ? 5 ? 1 by FACS analysis, thus supporting previous results (Miller et al. 1977; Ward and Tattersall 1982) . With respect to replication of MMV, the mESCs used in the present investigation are similar to mECCs. Resistance to infection by MMV may involve the transport of viral antigen or capsid to the nucleus (Tattersall 1978) or as a result of post-adsorptional events rather than of the lack of binding of virus to the surface of the target cell (Spalholz and Tattersall 1983; Tattersall and Bratton 1983) .",

Furthermore, recipients were seropositive for MHV-A59 but not for MMVp only when a high dose of 10 4 TCID 50 /mESC was used. Pups were seropositive for MHV-A59 when their mothers were seropositive by day 14 post embryo transfer. Furthermore, this antibody was maternal in origin since it decreased with time after birth. With respect to germline chimera obtained, a similar number of progeny was born when mESCs were virus-free or cultured with 10 -1 TCID 50 MHV-A59 or MMVp/cell for 6 h. Culture with the higher dose (10 4 TCID 50 / mESC) of MHV-A59 did not lead to the production of chimeras. Similarly, culture with 10 -1 TCID 50 MHV-A59 or MMVp/cell over four or five passages did not lead to the production of chimeras whereas the controls were not affected. Furthermore, similar to the results for the 6 h short-term culture with 10 4 TCID 50 MHV-A59/mESC, seroconversion also occurred with longterm MHV-exposed (P13 ? 5 ? 4) but not MMVexposed (P13 ? 5 ? 5) mESCs. Blastocyst injection with mESCs which were previously incubated for 1 h with 1 PFU MCMV/cell led to the development of normal offspring that contained no MCMV DNA (Tebourbi et al. 2002) . However, no data is available on the antibody status of the recipients and pups from that study. Similar to the present study where mESCs were incubated with the viruses for 6 h, the lack of an effect on the reproductive performance by co-incubation of mESCs with MCMV may be due to short-term exposure.",

            "text": "The number of passages of mESCs could influence the GLT. Nagy et al. (1993) reported that prolonged in vitro culture affected the initial totipotency of the R1 cell line (129/Sv 9 129/Sv-CP background), whereas sublines were capable of further culture, retaining their totipotency and giving rise to viable chimeras. In the present study, mESCs were cultured without feeder cells on gelatin to ensure reliable data production from the mESCs alone. Due to the low numbers of mESCs from cultures inoculated with MHV-A59 at later passages it was not possible to measure the pluripotency status using FACS. Instead, the mESCs were used for blastocyst injections. However, at P13 ? 5 ? 1, the percentage of mESCs positive for POU5F1 alone was highest in the control group (80%) compared to the MHV (55%) and MMV groups (65%). The true test of pluripotency of mESCs is the contribution to the germline. In this study, the production of germline chimeras was affected, indicating that the lack of GLT was due to the presence of the viruses and not to the number of passages since virus-free control mESCs led to germline chimeras. The reason for a lack of GLT in MHV-exposed mESCs may be attributed to effects associated with cytolysis, perhaps due to inhibition of the host macromolecular synthesis, but the mechanism remains unclear as to why the GLT of MMVexposed mESCs was affected despite a restrictive infection and a lack of anti-MMV antibodies in the recipients and pups. The latter observation may be due to changes in the nucleus of the mESCs since MMV replicates in the nucleus of permissive cells but this phenomenon warrants further study.",

In view of the increasing use of mESCs in biomedical research, it is of paramount importance to screen mESCs for unwanted microorganisms prior to their use. In this way, early detection could save valuable resources while misinterpretations of experimental results could be avoided. In addition, use of pathogen-free mESCs is of importance to animal welfare since the number of mice used for genetic engineering can be reduced.",
