The issue concerning sustainable approach to healthcare system design has become increasingly important. A growing number of hospitals are becoming more interested in implementing sustainable methods at the existing facilities. Making changes in purchasing, materials management, work practices, and waste management can reduce or eliminate harmful environmental hazards at the healthcare facilities. Hazards can also be reduced by changing how wastes are treated. Improved sorting and recycling systems reduce the amount of waste that must be incinerated. Far more materials are disposed in the average medical waste disposer than necessary to protect the public and the patients from disease (SH, 2010) . Only 15% of hospital waste is considered infectious waste that requires special treatment. Pathological waste such as tissues and organs which comprises 2% of average hospital waste requires incineration (Rutala and Mayhall, 1992) .",

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency anticipates that the costs of meeting new regulations and standards will lead some healthcare facilities to switch to alternative waste disposal methods (U.S. EPA, 2002) . In the light of the above challenges, the concept of the closed-loop supply chain becomes an attractive option for minimizing hospital waste. However, lack of awareness of the closed-loop supply chain and its short research history is the main reason why hospitals have not considered it in the past. Moreover, closed-loop supply chains add complexity to overall supply chain management and requires an initial investment (Ostlin et al., 2008) .",

The logistics community has also not recognized the similarity and made the comparison between the manufacturing of products and the provision of healthcare in process reengineering (Kumar and Shim, 2006) . Many investigators have studied the cases of process redesign in healthcare supply chains. For example, Young (1992) examined the materials management departments of 22 general hospitals in the state of Georgia using two approaches such as the multi-criteria performance measurement technique, and data envelopment analysis. Christopher and Marino (1995) also proposed six basic steps for successful reengineering. Through a case study, reengineering steps were proved to double the inventory turnover rate and reduce inventory, labour expense and storage space. Cynthia and Muller (1997) studied the integration of materials management processes using a team model. Huang (1998) classified different types of materials management systems among Taiwanese hospitals by using a fuzzy clustering method. Further, Chow-Chua and Goh (2000) studied how total quality management principles improved the healthcare sector in Singapore.",

Because of this assumption, most researchers have evaluated selected supply chain process improvement (Zhang, 2001) . Although the escalation of medical cost has been the number one issue in healthcare for the last four decades, most researchers have not considered reorganizing processes using RFID technology in hospital supply chains. RFID is a recent innovative technology that has been applied in logistics and manufacturing and is likely to be among the most exciting and fastest-growing technologies in terms of scope application (Heinrich, 2005; Gaukler and Seifert, 2007) . Healthcare providers must maintain distribution and inventory systems similar to those in the manufacturing industry. It can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of hospitals in numerous ways, such as better inventory management (medicine, linens, beds, etc.) and smarter physical flows (patients, beds, etc.) (Banks et al., 2007; Sarac et al., 2010) . Although it has been found that the paramount problem in IT implementation in healthcare systems is the high initial cost (Kumar et al., 2008) , healthcare has been forecast to be the next home for RFID (Erickson and Kelly, 2007) .

(2002) , Lee et al. (2004), and Tellkamp (2003) . Potential benefits of RFID in supply chains have been studied by Joshi (2000) , Kang and Gershwin (2004) , Lee et al. (2005) , Fleisch and Tellkamp (2005) and de Kok and Shang (2007) in inventory inaccuracy, bullwhip effect, and optimal procurement policy areas. Their findings indicate inventory inaccuracy in a wide range of processes such as transaction errors, scanning errors, shrinkage errors, supply errors, theft and so on. RFID can improve supply chain performances by increasing inventory availability, reducing inventory levels, saving cost, and improving coordination. Moreover, RFID can deal with the bullwhip effect by reducing the information distortion through data capture and realtime communication properties. Sarac et al. (2010) analysed the impact of RFID on supply chain systems, specially inventory management, by classifying the approaches into four main classes: analytical approach (Lee and Ozer, 2007; Rekik et al., 2007a,b) , simulation approach (Brown et al., 2001; Leung et al., 2007) , case studies and experiments (Lefebvre et al., 2006; Wamba et al., 2007; Bottani and Rizzi, 2008) . Lee and Ozer (2007) integrated RFID technology with an analytical model on inventory inaccuracy, and observed that RFID can reduce transaction errors by 90%. Kang and Koh (2002) simulated a retailer inventory system using RFID. Leung et al. (2007) also developed a simulation to analyse the impact of RFID on shrinkage errors. Furthermore, Lefebvre et al. (2006) developed a pilot study to analyse RFID deployment in the warehouse. Their findings show that RFID can improve the existing processes and the communication between supply chain actors. Moreover, Ngai et al. (2008) reviewed and classified the literature on RFID technologies that was published between 1995 and 2005. Their study included a content-oriented classification of literature and found that 10.7% of the articles deal with the application of RFID in supply chains. Furthermore, Chao et al. (2007) reviewed the literature on trends and forecast of RFID technologies from 1991 to 2005 by bibliometric analysis.",

They gave a perspective to future studies on the impact of RFID technologies on inventory inaccuracy in supply chains. Dolgui and Proth (2008) also focus on the advantages of RFID technologies in inventory management including reduction of shrinkage and theft. However, their survey is based on a limited number of publications and does not contain recent publications. RFID technology offers several benefits to supply chains such as inventory and warehouse management, (Banks et al., 2007; Saygin et al., 2007; Michael and McCathie, 2005) . Banks et al. (2007) show a list of qualitative and quantitative factors for RFID implementations. They also conclude that RFID can provide cost reduction and increased revenue. Michael and McCathie (2005) extensively investigated into the pros and cons of RFID technology within an inventory management context, giving businesses the opportunity to weigh up the costs and benefits. Numerous investigators have highlighted that RFID can reduce bullwhip effect and improve supply chain performance (Zaharudin et al., 2006; Saygin et al., 2007; Bottani and Rizzi, 2008; Wang et al., 2008; Zhou, 2009; Agarwal et al., 2009) .

            "text": "Application of a simulation approach to evaluate the value of information visibility in a supply chain using RFID has been studied by many researchers. For example, Joshi (2000) simulated a simple supply chain to evaluate the value of information visibility using RFID. He tested different scenarios by varying the degree of information visibility and supply chain actors' collaboration through RFID technologies. The results showed that information visibility and collaboration provide 40e70% reduction in inventory costs. He also concluded that the reduction in lost sales improves customer service due to timely order deliveries. Kang and Koh (2002) also simulated a retailer inventory system with an automatic reorder point procurement policy. They show that 2.5% increase of shrinkage can increase stock-out rate by about 50%. Further, Fleisch and Tellkamp (2005) simulated a one-product three-level supply chain. They compared two models with and without an inventory level alignment. The results showed that the elimination of inventory inaccuracy can reduce out of stock level and supply chain costs. Basinger (2006) developed a simulation model of a single item, three-level supply chain and studied the impact of inaccuracy on supply chain performance. He concluded that RFID is a new method for real-time alignment of the data that can improve the accuracy of inventory. Lee et al. (2004) perform a quantitative simulation and compare different models with or without RFID with different values of replenishment policy (s,S). The results show that RFID implementation can reduce the distribution centre inventory level by 23%, and eliminate completely back orders. Leung et al. (2007) simulated a three-echelon supply chain and tested three scenarios (with and without RFID). The results obtained show that backorder quantity decreases by 1% and the average inventory increases by 20%. They also observe that RFID can decrease inventory levels. Further, Saygin et al. (2007) also used simulation to compare four inventory models in order to analyse the impacts of RFID implementations on the inventory management of time-sensitive materials. He concluded that RFID can provide important benefits by decreasing manufacturing costs with a higher service level.",

Since RFID automates the tracking of medical, linen and equipment supplies, the healthcare organisation can derive significant benefits from RFID applications. For example, speedy transactions through RFID applications could derive a potential cost saving exceeding $2.6 billion per year in the healthcare sector (Jarrett, 1998) . Similarly, efficient inventory management through RFID could generate significant saving on healthcare supply chains (Van Vactor, 2008; Raviprakash et al., 2009; Ygal, 2012) . Other potential benefits may include effective linkage of patient demand with sourcing, ensuring the timely delivery of medical and non-medical supplies (Acharyulu, 2007; Aguado et al., 2007; Mark, 2011) . Tu et al. (2009) analyse the performance of RFID technologies in a health care system and simulate different algorithms for locating RFID based tagged objects. DeScioli (2005) studied differentiating hospital supply chain for enhanced performance. He concludes that the implementation of automated point of use systems has enabled hospitals to develop more sophisticated supply chain policies that can further increase patient care and simultaneously reduce costs. Hikmet et al. (2007) describe that the hospitals' adoption of healthcare information technology is related to four independent variables: hospital size, geographic location, system membership, and tax status. Additionally, Schuller and Hubner (2008) found that the hospitals are employing a variety of methods to keep logistics costs down while at the same time trying to optimize the level of service.",

The air pressure in the pipe sends all the soiled linens from the wards directly into the linens department. Soiled linens are packed into bags before they are delivered into the pipes. These bags can be delivered down the pipes at any time of the day. The hygiene standard states that all personnel should minimize contact with soiled linens. Disposal is performed on a daily basis, at irregular hours. When the soiled linens arrive at the linens department, they are held back in the chute opening until an indicated level before the mechanism is activated to open up the chute door hence releasing the soiled linens into a rail mounted metal cage. Soiled linens are stacked up to a designated level before it triggers an Infra red sensor. Upon activation of the sensor, the metal cage starts travelling on a metal rail until it reaches the staging area where the soiled linens are handled by four soiled linen staff that are in charge of counting and transferring the bags of soiled linens into an open cage.",

Despite having automation, the department faces a critical issue of poor visibility in the inventory level. This is largely due to the hygiene standard of minimal human contact with soiled linens. When soiled linens are delivered down from the pipes, they are packed into bags for easy collection and accounting. However, this hinders the counting process of individual pieces as it is non-hygienic to open up the bags. The department uses estimates to account for total soiled linens sent out to the sub contractor. This gave rise to poor visibility and hence the inability to track for losses during the cleaning.",

This process is time consuming and may result in data errors. As such, a well configured RFID station in the linens department as well as in the wards will be able to rectify the above problem. Establishing a RFID system where a reader and antenna is mounted on a conveyor belt will be able to automate the process of loading the soiled linens onto the delivery truck and at the same time provide visibility of real-time volume flow of soiled linens. Secondly, the problem of low visibility of linens usage in wards can be rectified by deploying a RFID station at the linens pick-up point since the pick-up point is a common choke point for all personnel to collect clean linens for their wards.

These tags allow bulk reading of up to hundreds of tags per second, a read range of up to few meters with no line-of-sight requirements, and operation in harsh environments with storage capacity (96 bits\u00fe). Performance improvement of passive UHF RFID tags has been exponential with features such as anti-collision algorithms, improved communication protocols, increased data capacity, dynamic authentication, and ruggedized designs for laundry management. Lines Department uses \"SMLD XX\" tags from Synometrix and Tagsys HF tags which are rugged waterproof and dry cleaning chemical proof RFID laundry tags with or without center hole for total laundry management and offer high mechanical resistance, and resistance to heat (\u00c025 C to 150 C for 50 h which is within the washing temperatures), and pressure (45 bar). These tags are much smaller (ranging from 15 mm/thickness 2.9 mm) and cheaper than active tags. Primary consideration for the tag design includes the overall size and shape. They operate at the frequency of 13.56 MHz, contain 2 k bits read-write memory, and read 50 tags per second.

The arrival rate for the packed linens is assumed to be at a constant number of 6300 (450 bags * 14). The packed linens are set to arrive from 8.00 am to 8.30 am; arrival rate is zero after 8.30 am. Four clean linens staff and 1 personnel are assigned in the model. The capacity for the Metal Trolley is set at 300 packed linens. The AGV motion is modelled in one-way, it will travel from the Metal Trolley Holding Area to the AGV Loading Bay.",

The initial process took an average of 39.19 min (Table 1) while the process with RFID took an average of 44.23 min ( Table 2 ). The increase in timing is due to the additional process-Transfer to Conveyor and the station-Conveyor (see Fig. 5 ). Thus, with a slight trade-off in timing, the process with RFID implementation provides visibility for the soiled linens out to SCORE. The average waiting time for the Open Cage Limit Queue is 44.07 min and is the most time consuming. As the Open Cage Limit is set at a larger value of 90, more time is needed for the Open Cage to be filled and proceed to the next stage. Thus, the longer waiting time of 41.22 min is expected even after the RFID implementation. Moreover, as the chute capacity is set at 50 bags of linen, the average waiting time for the Chute Limit Queue is also time consuming (26.2 min) and has decreased slightly to 25.3 min after RFID implementation. The waiting times at other stations have also decreased (see Tables 1 and 2) .",

It is less than the 6300 packed clean linens input, as some of the packed clean linens might be kept in the Shelf and stored, while others might still be in process. Prior to RFID implementation, AGVs delivered the daily linens requirements of the hospital wards and did not account for the unused linens from the wards. This resulted into the department keeping a higher pile level as compared to a replenishment system where the AGVs only needed to replenish the used linens in the wards. Personnel scan when collect linens (after RFID implementation) took a longer average waiting time (273.24 min in Table 4 ) than personnel collect linens (155.96 min in Table 3 ) before RFID implementation. The reason for this longer wait time might be due to the newly implemented RFID system. As all personnel need to scan the linens when collecting for patients' usage, they might not be familiar with the new computer interface and process and thus time is lost. Furthermore, the waiting times for metal trolley limit queue has dropped from 9.22 to 5.74 min, for transfer to metal trolley queue has dropped from 78.32 to 35.66 min, and for unload to linen room queue has dropped from 57.17 to 23.7 min after RFID implementation.",

Furthermore, in order to reduce the risk of RFID implementation, the reengineered closed-loop supply chain models have been evaluated from the different aspects. After analyzing the existing problems to find areas of opportunity for improvement, higher level RFID implementations were recommended hence bringing forth the process reengineering of the case study. Finally, the results from the reengineered models were obtained and findings reveal that there are improvements made in the process flow which ultimately fulfils the objectives of this research. A gap analysis of \"existing\" versus \"reengineered\" processes assisted in evaluating the capabilities of RFID to increase productivity through the elimination of search delays from the staff, the linens inventory shrinkage (around 8 linens per day) and recurrent linens shortages, as well as assess the benefits of elimination of costly replacement of lost or stolen linens. The decrease in cost 0.0 (0.0, 0.0) equals $140 per day (\u00bc$160 -$20) based on a quarterly loss of 12 percent of the linens and an increase in labour cost by $20. More than half of the activities have reached the desired minimum utilization rate of 50 percent. Several significant activities are almost fully used. The activities of Store have large space for further development. The reengineered model provides the more efficient solution. The number of the staff is reduced. The utilization of staff is much more efficient. Moreover, there is space for the development of the future plan.
