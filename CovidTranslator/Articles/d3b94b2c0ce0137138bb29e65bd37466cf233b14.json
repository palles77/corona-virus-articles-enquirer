However, the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches continues to be one of much debate and there is a need for a rigorous framework for designing and interpreting mixed methods research. This paper explores the analytical approaches (i.e. parallel, concurrent or sequential) used in mixed methods studies within healthcare and exemplifies the use of triangulation as a methodological metaphor for drawing inferences from qualitative and quantitative findings originating from such analyses. Design: This review of the literature used systematic principles in searching CINAHL, Medline and PsycINFO for healthcare research studies which employed a mixed methods approach and were published in the English language between January 1999 and September 2009. Results: In total, 168 studies were included in the results. Most studies originated in the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. The analytic approach most widely used was parallel data analysis. A number of studies used sequential data analysis; far fewer studies employed concurrent data analysis. Very few of these studies clearly articulated the purpose for using a mixed methods design. The use of the methodological metaphor of triangulation on convergent, complementary, and divergent results from mixed methods studies is exemplified and an example of developing theory from such data is provided. Conclusion: A trend for conducting parallel data analysis on quantitative and qualitative data in mixed methods healthcare research has been identified in the studies included in this review. Using triangulation as a methodological metaphor can facilitate the integration of qualitative and quantitative findings, help researchers to clarify their theoretical propositions and the basis of their results. This can offer a better understanding of the links between theory and empirical findings, challenge theoretical assumptions and develop new theory.",

            "text": "Mixed methods research has been widely used within healthcare research for a variety of reasons. The integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches is an interesting issue and continues to be one of much debate (Bryman, 2004; Morgan, 2007; Onwuegbuzie and Leech, 2005) . In particular, the different epistemological and ontological assumptions and paradigms associated with qualitative and quantitative research have had a major influence on discussions on whether the integration of the two is feasible, let alone desirable (Morgan, 2007; Sale et al., 2002) . Proponents of mixed methods research suggest that the purist view, that quantitative and qualitative approaches cannot be merged, poses a threat to the advancement of science (Onwuegbuzie and Leech, 2005) and that while epistemological and ontological commitments may be associated with certain research methods, the connections are not necessary deterministic (Bryman, 2004) . Mixed methods research can be viewed as an approach which draws upon the strengths and perspectives of each method, recognising the existence and importance of the physical, natural world as well as the importance of reality and influence of human experience (Johnson and Onquegbuzie, 2004) . Rather than continue these debates in this paper, we aim to explore the approaches used to integrate qualitative and quantitative data within healthcare research to date. Accordingly, this paper focuses on the practical issues of conducting mixed methods studies and the need to develop a rigorous framework for designing and interpreting mixed methods studies to advance the field. In this paper, we will attempt to offer some guidance for those interested in mixed methods research on ways to combine qualitative and quantitative methods.",

            "text": "The concept of mixing methods was first introduced by Jick (1979) , as a means for seeking convergence across qualitative and quantitative methods within social science research (Creswell, 2003) . It has been argued that mixed methods research can be particularly useful in healthcare research as only a broader range of perspectives can do justice to the complexity of the phenomena studied (Clarke and Yaros, 1988; Foss and Ellefsen, 2002; Steckler et al., 1992) . By combining qualitative and quantitative findings, an overall or negotiated account of the findings can be forged, not possible by using a singular approach (Bryman, 2007) . Mixed methods can also help to highlight the similarities and differences between particular aspects of a phenomenon (Bernardi et al., 2007) . Interest in, and expansion of, the use of mixed methods designs have most recently been fuelled by pragmatic issues: the increasing demand for cost effective research and the move away from theoretically driven research to research which meets policymakers' and practitioners' needs and the growing competition for research funding (Brannen, 2009; O'Cathain et al., 2007) . Tashakkori and Creswell (2007) broadly define mixed methods research as ''research in which the investigator collects and analyses data, integrates the findings and draws inferences using both qualitative and quantitative approaches' ' (2007:3) . In any mixed methods study, the purpose of mixing qualitative and quantitative methods should be clear in order to determine how the analytic techniques relate to one another and how, if at all, the findings should be integrated (O'Cathain et al., 2008; Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie, 2003) . It has been argued that a characteristic of truly mixed methods studies are those which involve integration of the qualitative and quantitative findings at some stage of the research process, be that during data collection, analysis or at the interpretative stage of the research (Kroll and Neri, 2009 ). An example of this is found in mixed methods studies which use a concurrent data analysis approach, in which each data set is integrated during the analytic stage to provide a complete picture developed from both data sets after data has been qualitised or quantitised (i.e. where both forms of data have been converted into either qualitative or quantitative data so that it can be easily merged) (Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie, 2003) . Other analytic approaches have been identified including; parallel data analysis, in which collection and analysis of both data sets is carried out separately and the findings are not compared or consolidated until the interpretation stage, and finally sequential data analysis, in which data are analysed in a particular sequence with the purpose of informing, rather than being integrated with, the use of, or findings from, the other method (Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie, 2003) . An example of sequential data analysis might be where quantitative findings are intended to lead to theoretical sampling in an in depth qualitative investigation or where qualitative data is used to generate items for the development of quantitative measures.",

This can help to; describe the logical relations between the qualitative and quantitative findings and the theoretical concepts in a study; demonstrate the way in which both qualitative and quantitative data can be combined to facilitate an improved understanding of particular phenomena; and, can also be used to help generate new theory (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003 ) (see Fig. 1 ). The points of the triangle represent theoretical propositions and empirical findings from qualitative and quantitative data while the sides of the triangle represent the logical relationships between these propositions and findings. The nature and use of the triangle depends upon the outcome from the analysis, whether that be convergent, where qualitative and quantitative findings lead to the same conclusion; complementary, where qualitative and quantitative results can be used to supplement each other or; divergent, where the combination of qualitative and quantitative results provides different (and at times contradictory) findings. Each of these outcomes requires a different way of using the triangulation metaphor to link theoretical propositions to empirical findings (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) .",

Since this combination in CINAHL only limited the search results to 1017; a similar search was conducted but without using the search term triangulation to capture mixed methods papers; resulting in 237 hits. In CINAHL the search result on 1017 papers was further limited by (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) using ''interventions'' as a keyword resulting in 160 papers also selected to be reviewed. Moreover; in Medline the mixed methods data set was limited by the MeSH term ''research'' resulting in 218 hits and in PsycINFO with ''intervention'' as keyword or MeSH term resulting in 178 hits. When duplicates were removed the total numbers of papers identified were 843. The abstracts were then reviewed by each author and those identified as relevant to the review were selected to be retrieved and reviewed in full text. Papers were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: empirical studies; published in peer review journals; healthcare research (for the purpose of this paper defined as any study focussing on participants in receipt, or involved in the delivery, of healthcare or a study conducted within a healthcare setting, e.g. different kinds of care, health economics, decision making, and professionals' role development); and using mixed methods (defined as a study in which both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed (Halcomb et al., 2009b) . To maintain rigour, a random sample (10%) of the full text papers was reviewed jointly by two authors.

The majority of these studies originated in the USA (n = 63), the UK (n = 39) and Canada (n = 19), perhaps reflecting the considerable interest and expertise in mixed methods research within these countries. The focus of the studies included in the review varied significantly and the populations studied included both patients and healthcare professionals. Table 2 illustrates the types of analytic approaches adopted in each of the studies included in the review. The most widely used analytic approach (n = 98) was parallel analysis (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2007) . However, very few of the studies employing parallel analysis clearly articulate their purpose for mixing qualitative and quantitative data, the weighting (or priority) given to the qualitative and quantitative data or the expected outcomes from doing so, mirroring previous research findings (O'Cathain et al., 2008) . The weighting, or priority, of the qualitative and quantitative data in a mixed methods study is dependent upon various factors including; the aims of the study and whether the purpose is, for example, to contextualise quantitative data using qualitative data or to use qualitative data to inform a larger quantitative approach such as a survey. Nonetheless, the omission of this statement makes it difficult to determine which data set the conclusions have been drawn from and the role of, or emphasis on, each approach. Therefore, is of importance for authors to clearly state this in their papers (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2007) . A number of studies had also used sequential data analysis (n = 46), where qualitative approaches were visibly used to inform the development of both clinical tools (e.g. and research measures and surveys (e.g. or where quantitative surveys were supplemented by and issues further explored using qualitative approaches (e.g. .

In the UK, members of district nursing teams (DNs) provide most nursing care to people at home in the last year of life. Following concerns that inadequate education might limit the confidence of some DNs to support patients and their carers' at home, and that low home death rates may in part be related to this, the Department of Health (DH) identified good examples of palliative care educational initiatives for DNs and invested in a 3-year national education and support programme in the principles and practice of palliative care. Shipman et al.'s study evaluates whether the programme had measurable effects on DN knowledge and confidence in competency in the principles and practice of palliative care. The study had two parts, a summative (concerned with outcomes) quantitative component which included 'before and after' postal questionnaires which measured effects on DNs' (n = 1280) knowledge, confidence and perceived competence in the principles and practice of palliative care and a formative (concerned with process) qualitative component which included semi-structured focus groups and interviews with a sub-sample of DNs (n = 39).",

This proposition was tested quantitatively by pre-and post-test using the RSSI showing that the majority of carers experienced either a negative or no change in scores following the respite stay (no test of significance was stated). Accordingly, the theoretical proposition was not supported by the quantitative empirical data. The qualitative empirical results, however, were supportive in showing that most of the carers considered respite care to be important as it enabled them to have a break and a rest from ongoing care-responsibilities. From this divergent empirical data it could be suggested changing or developing the original theoretical proposition. It seems that respite care gave the carers relief from their care-responsibilities but not from the distress carers experienced in relation to caring (measured by the used scale). We would therefore suggest that in order to lessen distress related to caring, other types of support is also needed which would change the theoretical proposition as suggested (theoretical proposition 2). Fig. 4 illustrates the theoretical propositions, empirical findings from qualitative and quantitative data and the logical relationships between these. Theoretical proposition 1 was not supported by the quantitative findings (indicated in Fig. 4 by the broken arrow), but the qualitative findings supported this proposition. From these divergent empirical findings, the theoretical proposition could accordingly be changed and developed. Respite care seemed to provide relief from carers' on-going careresponsibilities, but other types of support need to be added to provide relief from distress experienced (theoretical proposition 2).",

While patients' QoL improved in the dimensions of pain, energy and mobility it deteriorated on dimensions of social isolation, sleep and emotional reactions. From the viewpoint of methodological triangulation used in the study the aim of the quantitative approach was to observe changes in QoL at the group level and also explore correlations of background factors to QoL. The qualitative approach generated information concerning both QoL in the individuals' life situation and life course and the individuals' rehabilitation. Both the quantitative and the qualitative analysis showed the youngest CAD patients to have the poorest psychosocial QoL. The results obtained using qualitative methods explained the quantitative findings and offered new insight into the factors related to poor psychosocial QoL, which could be used to help develop theoretical propositions around these. Patients at risk of poorer QoL were those with an acute onset of illness at a young age that led to an unexpected termination of career, resulting in financial problems, and worries about family. This group also experienced lack of emotional support (especially the females with CAD) and were concerned for the illness that was not alleviated by treatment. The interviews and the method of phenomenological psychology therefore helped to gain insight into the participants' situational experience of QoL and life course, not detectable by the use of a questionnaire. Fig. 5 illustrates the theoretical propositions, empirical findings from qualitative and quantitative data and the relationships between these. The use of the mixed methods approach enabled a clearer understanding to emerge in relation to the lived experience of CAD patients and the factors that were related to poor QoL. This understanding allows new theoretical propositions about these issues to be developed and further explored, as depicted at the theoretical level.",

This paper firstly intended to review the types of analytic approaches (parallel, concurrent or sequential data analysis) that have been used in mixed methods studies within healthcare research. As identified in previous research (O'Cathain et al., 2008) , we found that the majority of studies included in our review employed parallel data analysis in which the different analyses are not compared or consolidated until the full analysis of both data sets have been completed. A trend to conduct separate analysis on quantitative and qualitative data is apparent in mixed methods healthcare studies, despite the fact that if the data were correlated, a more complete picture of a particular phenomenon may be produced (Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie, 2003) .

For mixed methodologists, the 'triangulation metaphor' offers a framework to facilitate a description of the relationships between data sets and theoretical concepts and can also assist in the integration of qualitative and quantitative data (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) . Yet despite the fact that the framework was published in 2003 within Tashakkori and Teddlie's (2003) seminal work, the Handbook for Mixed Methods in Social and Behavioural Research, our search revealed that it has received little application within the published body of work around mixed methods studies since its publication. This is surprising since mixed methodologists are acutely aware of the lack of guidance with regards to the pragmatics and practicalities of conducting mixed methods research (Bryman, 2006; Leech et al., 2010) . Furthermore, there have been frequent calls to move the field of mixed methods away from the ''should we or shouldn't we'' debate towards the practical application, analysis and integration of mixed methods and its' findings and what we can learn from each other's work and advice. Consequently, we have a state of ambiguity and instability in the field of mixed methods in which mixed methodologists find themselves lacking appropriate sources or evidence to draw upon with which to facilitate the future design, conduct and interpretation of mixed methods studies. It is for these reasons that we, in this paper, also intended to identify and select studies that could be used as examples for the application of Erzberger and Kelle's (2003) triangulation metaphor.",

Wu and Volker (2009) previously acknowledged that while studies undoubtedly have a theoretical basis in their literature reviews and the nature of their research questions, they often fail to clearly articulate a particular theoretical framework. This is unfortunate as theory can help researchers to clarify their ideas and also help data collection, analysis and to improve the study's rigour (Wu and Volker, 2009 ). When using triangulation as a methodological metaphor (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) , researchers are encouraged to articulate their theoretical propositions and to validate their conclusions in relation to the chosen theories. Theory can also guide researchers when defining outcome measures. Should the findings not support the chosen theory, as shown in our examples on complementary and divergent results, researchers can modify or expand their theory accordingly and new theory may be developed (Wu and Volker, 2009) . It is therefore our belief that using triangulation as a methodological metaphor in mixed methods research can also benefit the design of mixed method studies.",

Many of the papers were even less clear when discussing their results and the basis of their conclusions. The reporting of mixed methods studies is notoriously challenging, but clarity and transparency are, at the very least, crucial in such reports (O'Cathain, 2009) . Using triangulation as a methodological metaphor (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) may be one way of addressing this lack of clarity by explicitly showing the types of data that researchers have based their interpretations on. It may even help address some of the issues raised in the debate on the feasibility of integrating research methods and results stemming from different epistemological and ontological assumptions and paradigms (Morgan, 2007; Sale et al., 2002) . In order to carry out methodological triangulation researchers also need to identify and observe the consistency and adequacy of the two methods, positivistic and phenomenological regarding the research questions, data collection, methods of analysis and conclusions.",

In many cases, reports of mixed methods studies are subjected to 'salami slicing' by researchers and hence the conduct of, and findings from, individual approaches are addressed in separate papers. Since these papers are often not indexed as a 'mixed method' study, they are undoubtedly more difficult to identify. Furthermore, different terminologies are used to describe and index mixed methods studies within the electronic databases (Halcomb and Andrew, 2009a) , making it challenging to be certain that all relevant studies were captured in this review. However, the studies included in this review should give a sufficient overview of the use of mixed analysis in healthcare research and most importantly, they enable us to make suggestions for the future design, conduct, interpretation and reporting of mixed methods studies. It is also important to emphasise that we have based our triangulation examples on the data published but have no further knowledge of the analysis and findings undertaken by the authors. The examples should thus be taken as examples and not alternative explanations or interpretations.",
