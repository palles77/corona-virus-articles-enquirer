We investigated the changes in serum proteome in dengue fever (DF) patients from a dengue-endemic area of India to obtain mechanistic insights about the disease pathogenesis, the host immune response, and identification of potential serum protein biomarkers of this infectious disease. In this study, serum samples from DF patients, healthy subjects, and patients with falciparum malaria (an infectious disease control) were investigated by 2D-DIGE in combination with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. The findings were validated with Western blotting. Functional clustering of the identified proteins was performed using PAN-THER and DAVID tools. Compared to the healthy controls, we found significant changes in the expression levels of 48 protein spots corresponding to 18 unique proteins (7 downregulated and 11 upregulated) in DF patients ( p < 0.05). Among these differentially-expressed proteins, 11 candidates exhibited different trends in dengue fever compared to falciparum malaria. Importantly, our results suggest that dengue virus infection leads to alterations in expression levels of multiple serum proteins involved in diverse and vital physiological pathways, including acute phase response signaling, complement cascades, hemostasis, and blood coagulation. For the first time we report here that the serum levels of hemopexin, haptoglobin, serum amyloid P, and kininogen precursor, are altered in DF. This study informs the pathogenesis and host immune response to dengue virus infection, as well as the current search for new diagnostic and molecular drug targets.",

            "text": "D engue fever (DF) is a vector-borne infectious disease transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and caused by four different serotypes of dengue virus (DENV 1-4), members of the family Flaviviridae. This rapidly-spreading mosquito-borne viral infection often manifests in severe forms, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (Guha-Sapir and Schimmer, 2005) , which can lead to life-threatening complications, including vascular permeability, hemorrhagic manifestations, and thrombocytopenia, unless diagnosed promptly and treated at an early stage (Cardier et al., 2005) . Over the last two decades, dengue infection has rapidly expanded worldwide, and has evolved as a major public health problem in more than 100 countries, specifically in tropical and subtropical regions. According to recent World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, around 50 million clinical cases of dengue infec-tion occur annually, and approximately 2.5 billion people around the globe, including a large proportion of children, are at risk of this fatal viral disease (Dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever; World Health Organization, 2008). In India, due to the favorable climatic factors such as rain, temperature, and relative humidity, the occurrence of dengue infection is common, and it spreads rapidly like other mosquito-borne diseases, and often leads to severe outbreaks (Chakravarti and Kumaria, 2005) . Additionally, in recent years in-country geographic expansion of dengue infection has been experienced in India, with increasing numbers of cyclic epidemics and higher case-fatality rates (3-5%), and a 2.5-fold increase in clinical cases over the last 5 years (Nathan et al., 2009) .",

Plasma is the liquid part of unclotted blood after removal of solid cellular components, while serum is plasma devoid of fibrinogen and other clotting factors. Previous studies have shown that differences in overall protein diversity of heparinized plasma and serum are negligible, aside from a lack of fibrinogen in the later (Zimmerman et al., 2012) , and thus these fluids are often considered equivalent for many assays (Ladenson et al., 1974) . Nevertheless, due to the removal of fibrinogen and other clotting factors, the overall protein content of serum is lower than that of plasma, which may be advantageous for the analysis of analytes present in trace amounts (Denery et al., 2011; Kronenberg et al., 1998; Ray et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Conventionally, dengue infection is diagnosed by employing dengue-specific IgM antibody, which detects disease after 5-10 days in primary dengue virus infection (Gubler and Meltzer, 1999) . Emerging molecular diagnostic methods, viral isolation, or PCR, are effective for early diagnosis of dengue infection, but these techniques are expensive and time-consuming, and too costly for use as routine tests in most developing countries (Singh et al., 2010) . Thus the establishment of early detection surrogates can help to meet the need for less expensive and better diagnostics and more effective therapy. The present study was conducted to investigate alterations in the serum proteome in dengue fever (DF) patients compared to healthy subjects in a dengue-endemic area of India (Mumbai, Maharashtra). Serum proteomic alterations in another clinically-relevant mosquito-borne infectious disease, falciparum malaria, have recently been investigated by our group (Ray et al., 2012b) . To make the present study more comprehensive and informative, serum levels of the identified proteins, which exhibited altered expression levels in DF (compared to healthy subjects), were further examined in falciparum malaria patients (Ray et al., 2012b) . The inclusion of falciparum malaria as a disease control in this comparative proteomic analysis helped to assess the specificity of the identified candidate proteins in DF, and to distinguish the generic febrile responses as well. While the foremost aim of this proteomic study was to investigate disease pathogenesis and host responses in dengue fever, another possible outcome could be the identification of early detection surrogates for this vector-borne viral infection.",

Additionally, one of our identified targets, a 1 -antitrypsin, has previously been reported to be upregulated in serum samples of DF and DHF patients (Thayan et al., 2009) . Correlations obtained between our results and those of previous proteomic studies enhanced the confidence of this analysis. Moreover, quite a few differentially-expressed proteins identified in this study, including serum amyloid P, haptoglobin, complement C4, complement factor H, hemopexin, and kininogen precursor have not been reported in earlier proteomics studies of DF.

Although simultaneous transmission of both of these vector-borne infections is rare, there are quite a few published reports describing dual infections with dengue and malaria in endemic areas (Bhalla et al., 2006; Charrel et al., 2005; Kaushik et al., 2007; Ward, 2006) . In addition, similarities in the clinical manifestations of dengue and malaria often make it difficult to identify the etiology of these two mosquito-borne infectious diseases. Accurate discrimination between these two infections and early diagnosis are essential for providing the proper treatments, which are quite different for the two diseases, in spite of the similarities in symptoms and signs. In light of the similarities between dengue viral and plasmodial infections in terms of symptoms, signs, and etiology, falciparum malaria patients were included as febrile disease controls in this comparative serum proteomic analysis to evaluate the specific host responses and proteomic alterations in dengue fever. Interestingly, a few serum proteins, such as serum amyloid P, kininogen, and complement factors H and C3 exhibited altered expression levels in DF patients, but not in falciparum malaria patients (Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Fig. S1B ; see online supplementary material at http://www.liebertonline .com). Serum amyloid P (SAP), a member of the pentraxin family, exhibited a 1.7-fold increased expression in DF patients (Table 1) . Earlier in vitro studies have shown that SAP can inhibit influenza A virus infection through binding of terminal N-acetyl-galactosamine, mannose, and glucuronic acid residues of the virus particle in a calcium-dependent process (Andersen et al., 1997) . Reduced serum levels of kininogen were observed in DF patients, which may be due to the limited proteolysis of this precursor molecule for generating bradykinin to trigger inflammatory reactions via activating endothelial cells, and to participate in tissue hyperresponsiveness and local inflammation (Kaplan et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Induction of the release of bradykinin leads to vascular leakage, and the subsequent hypotension and shock observed in severe dengue fever patients (Regoli and Barab\u00e9, 1980) . Activation of the complement cascades (classical and alternative), and the lectin-dependent pathways with the altered expression levels of C4, C3, C3a, C5a, and factor H, have been observed in DF patients (Table 1 and Supplementary  Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S5 ; see online supplementary material at http://www.liebertonline.com). An association of complement activation with dengue fever has been previously reported (Albuquerque et al., 2009; Avirutnan et al., 2011; Nascimento et al., 2009; Shaio et al., 1992) ; nevertheless, its exact relationship with disease pathogenesis and the mechanisms of activation remain unknown. Complement activation plays a vital role in protection against dengue viral infection through modulating adaptive immunity and activating virus-specific antibodies (Avirutnan et al., 2008) . Activation of the complement system might be triggered by immune complexes generated in response to flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) (Green and Rothman, 2006) . Interestingly, a few complement factors and associated regulatory proteins such as clusterin, complement C4, and properdin factor B, have shown opposite trends of differential expression in DF and febrile controls (compared to HC; Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Fig. S1B ; see online supplementary material at http://www.liebertonline.com). Elevated serum levels of clusterin were observed in this study (Fig. 2) . This complement inhibitory factor interacts with the free soluble form of dengue virus (DV) NS1, and the NS1/Clu interaction may lead to the plasma leakage associated with DV infections (Kurosu et al., 2007) . Avirutnan and associates have demonstrated that NS1-mediated complement activation involves vascular leakage, probably through the generation of anaphylatoxins and SC5b-9 during the severe manifestations of dengue viral infection (DHF and DSS; Avirutnan et al., 2006) . According to a previous proteomic study, higher serum levels of dengue NS1 protein are observed in DHF patients compared with DF patients, indicating its possible correlation with disease severity (Thayan et al., 2009) . Since the outcome of a productive infection depends on the balance between complement activation and evasion, detailed investigations of the functional aspects of complement factors and regulatory proteins could provide potential therapeutic targets.",

Dengue virus infection can also lead to endothelial cell injury (Butthep et al., 1993) , which in turn may cause activation of the coagulation system and alteration of hemostasis in a direct or indirect way (Stemerman et al., 1984) . However, the relevance of the activation of the coagulation system to the pathogenesis of dengue virus infection is not clear. The dengue fever patients analyzed in this proteomic study were suffering from primary infection, without any hemorrhagic phenomena (DHF) or shock (DSS).

            "text": "plasma/serum proteins in dengue hemorrhagic fever could provide interesting insights into the disease's pathogenesis. Serum proteins that exhibited similar trends of differential expression in DF and febrile controls were mostly acute phase proteins (APPs), and may be regular indicators of blood infection and inflammation. These APPs are found to be involved in inflammation-mediated acute phase signaling, and different host-adaptive and host-defense mechanisms. For instance, haptoglobin (Hp) was significantly downregulated in DF and FM patients compared to the healthy controls (Table 1) . Hp possesses anti-inflammatory activity and innate phenotype-dependent antioxidant activity, it removes free hemoglobin (Hb) released during hemolysis, and it plays an important role in stimulating angiogenesis and has an inhibitory role in inflammation (Quaye, 2008) . Downregulation of Hp reflects reduced levels of free Hp in patient sera, which is probably due to Hb-Hp complex formation and subsequent clearance by macrophages and monocytes. Elevated serum levels of different serine protease inhibitors, including a 1antitrypsin (1.44-fold), a 1 -antichymotrypsin (2.44-to 2.61-fold), and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (1.5-fold), were observed in the dengue patients as well as in febrile controls. Over-expression of a 1 -antichymotrypsin and a 1antitrypsin have previously been reported in dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (Albuquerque et al., 2009; Thayan et al., 2009) , and other viral infections such as SARScoronavirus (Wan et al., 2006) and hepatitis B virus (Tan et al., 2011) . Upregulation of these protease inhibitors might be a consequence of the host response to prevent the inflammation and vascular damage triggered by dengue virus infection.",

Some of our identified targets, including complement factors C4 and H, kininogen precursor, and clusterin, are interesting due to their functional relevance in DF pathogenesis, and thus warrant further research as potential inflammation-related biomarkers of DF. Future studies of these identified proteins in DHF and DSS may also show biologically relevant correlations with disease severity.
