Neutrophil migration is regulated by chemokine receptors and their cognate ligands. Our previous study investigated the effect of n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. The present study stimulated neutrophils with LPS to explore the influence of LPS on cell. Neutrophils were then pretreated with n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis followed by LPS to examine the effect of this extract on neutrophil chemotaxis. The results showed that LPS decreased the expression levels of CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR)1, CXCR2 and L-selectin (CD62L), and increased the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) by neutrophils. The addition of n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis inhibited this LPS-induced downregulation of CXCR1, CXCR2 and CD62L, and decreased the expression of IL-8 on neutrophils. In addition, n-butanol extract promoted myeloperoxidase activity in neutrophils. Taken together, LPS downregulated the expression of chemokine receptors, leading to the failure of neutrophils to migrate to sites of infection. The addition of n-butanol extract, which promoted the ability of neutrophils to migrate, is a natural product and potential therapeutic agent with which to target neutrophil chemotaxis during LPS stimulation.",

Sepsis remains the leading cause of mortality in patients in Intensive Care Units (3) and the associated burden of care incurs financial burden. However, the pathogenesis of sepsis remains to be fully delineated and effective therapies are lacking.

As the most abundant subset of leukocytes, the involvement of PMN in sepsis is significant (3, 6, 7) . The migration of PMNs is regulated by chemoattractants and chemokine gradients (3, 7, 8) . CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR)1 and CXCR2 are the major chemokine receptors on PMNs, with interleukin (IL)-8 acting as a ligand of these receptors (9) . Severe sepsis is associated with the failure of PMNs to migrate (10) . In a previous clinical study, patients with suppression of PMN receptors were predisposed to inflammatory response syndrome (11) . Previous in vitro investigations have demonstrated that CXCR2 is downregulated upon stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (12) . The activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) also suppresses the expression of CXCR2 (13) . In an experimental mouse model of sepsis, the failure of PMNs to migrate was shown to result in a high rate of mortality (1). Tancevski et al and Van Zee et al reported that promoting the recruitment of PMNs ameliorates sepsis and attenuates sepsis-related injury and infection, respectively (14, 15) . Therefore, in order to improve treatment of inflammatory disorders, including sepsis, the promotion of PMN chemotaxis is an attractive target (6).",

In addition to being used to cure febrile diseases, including dipsosis, fever, jaundice and hematemesis, F. isatidis is also deployed against diseases, including mumps, viral hepatitis, influenza and epidemic encephalitis B (16) (17) (18) . It was reported to be effective during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome flu outbreak (19) . These antimicrobial and anti-endotoxic properties indicate its potential to be developed into a natural antibiotic (20, 21) . In our previous study (22) , the main chemical components of F. isatidis were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography. It was also demonstrated that F. isatidis increased the survival of septic mice, and ameliorated lung injury by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 through the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 and nuclear factor-\u03baB pathways (22) . Although the beneficial immunomodulatory effects of F. isatidis have been the focus of previous investigations, whether this herb has an effect on chemokine receptors remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to determine whether F. isatidis affects the migration of PMNs.",

However, no significant changes were observed in the expression levels of TLR2, TLR4 or CD11b in the LPS-treated neutrophils, compared with the vehicle-treated neutrophils (Fig. 1D-F) .

CXCR1 and CXCR2 are the major chemokine receptors on neutrophils. Chemokine receptors regulate the migration of neutrophils to the site of infection to assist in controlling invading pathogens and protecting the body. Duerschmied et al (27) demonstrated that survival following LPS-induced endotoxic shock improved upon the promotion of neutrophil recruitment during acute inflammation. n-butanol extract was found to have significant antiseptic abilities in our previous study.

This suggested that the extract increased the activity of neutrophils and upregulated the expression of chemokine receptors, including CXCR1 and CXCR2, rendering neutrophils more sensitive to the ligand IL-8. The present study quantified MPO activity as a measure of neutrophil migration. It was found the extract promoted the activity of MPO.

With the ability to promote the expression of CXCR1, CXCR2 Figure 2 . n-butanol extract from Folium isatidis inhibits the downregulated protein levels of CXCR1, CXCR2 and CD62L. Following pretreatment with a vehicle control (DMSO) or n-butanol extract at the indicated concentration for 2 h, neutrophils were incubated with LPS (0.5 \u00b5g/ml) for 4 h. Expression levels of (A) CXCR1, (B) CXCR2 and (C) CD62L were measured using flow cytometry. The corresponding mean fluorescence intensity was calculated. Each bar represents the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean of three independent experiments. Statistical significance relative to the LPS group was determined. ** P<0.01.

However, due to the presence of multiple bioactive components in the extract and limited approaches for preparing extracts from F. isatidis, it is difficult to identify the precise agent inhibiting LPS-induced chemokine receptor downregulation. Although the main active chemical components have been identified, there are more than eight major compounds in n-butanol extract (22) . Further investigation is required to identify the active compound in F. isatidis.",
