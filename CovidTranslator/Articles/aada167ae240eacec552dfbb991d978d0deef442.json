The results are used to parameterize the Health Belief Model of individual health-protective decision making. Survey subjects were asked questions about their perceptions of the then-circulating influenza and attitudes towards two personal protective behaviors: vaccination and avoidance of crowds. We empirically address two important issues in applying the Health Belief Model of behavior to computational infectious disease simulation: (1) the factors dynamically influencing the states of the Health Belief Model variables and (2) the appropriateness of the Health Belief Model in describing self-protective behavior in the context of pandemic influenza.",

These have a largely unexplored potential for parameterizing computational behavior-adoption models. Despite the rather extensive literature on correlations between health beliefs and behavior, there has been very little work that empirically explores the drivers that cause those health beliefs to change over the course of an outbreak. For example, to properly model an individual's perception of the severity of a disease, a theory of what new information makes an individual's perceived severity change between low and high is necessary. Some candidate \"drivers\" are the instantaneous prevalence of the disease, the geographic or social proximity of the individual to publicized outbreaks, and the intensity of media attention being placed upon the epidemic. A mechanistic understanding of the relationships between external drivers and health beliefs is crucial for a well-structured computational model. For this reason, in addition to collecting data on the variables of the HBM, we collected data on their hypothesized drivers.",

Questions were asked regarding the respondents' perceptions of and experiences with H1N1 influenza, in particular with respect to the variables of the Health Belief Model. Respondents were asked about their Perceived Susceptibility to the disease and about two separate measures of Perceived Severity, perceived chance of death following contracting swine flu and perceived hardship of H1N1 relative to seasonal flu. Respondents were asked their opinion of the amount of media coverage of the outbreak and the governmental response to the pandemic as well as their opinions of the efficacy of two protective personal health behaviors, vaccination and avoidance of crowded public areas (Perceived Benefits), and their adherence to these practices. They were also asked the perceived difficulty of avoiding crowds and concern about side effects of vaccination (Perceived Barriers).

However, neither the difficulty of avoiding crowded places (Perceived Barriers) nor one's Perceived Susceptibility to H1N1 were significantly correlated with avoiding crowded places. Table IV shows the multivariate logistic relationship between the Health Belief Model variables and the two health behaviors of our study. For vaccination, the standard components of the HBM were correlated with behavior, although Perceived Susceptibility was not significant. Avoiding crowded places was correlated only with Perceived Benefits. Difficulty of crowd avoidance (Perceived Barriers), hardship (Perceived Severity), and likelihood of contracting H1N1 (Perceived Susceptibility) were not correlated with this behavior. Equation 1, the standard logistic regression equation expressed in terms of odds ratios, is parameterized by the odds ratios in Table IV and can be used as a model of decision making in agent-based simulations (7) . The HBM variables are in one of two states: x i = 0 (low) or 1 (high) for each i \u2208 (Sus, Sev, Ben, Bar) (abbreviations of Susceptibility, Severity, Benefits, and Barriers). (1) In a fully implemented agent-based model, the probability that an agent adopts a particular behavior could be calculated by this equation. For example, an individual with 'high' Perceived Benefits, and 'low' Perceived Severity, Susceptibility, and Barriers for vaccination would have exponents x Ben = 1 and x Sev = x Sus = x Bar = 0, with a probability of vaccination of 0.399 as shown in Equation 2. Individual heterogeneity could be incorporated by allowing agents to sample their parameters from a distribution defined across the 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratios given in Table IV . (2) This approach can be extended to incorporate demographic heterogeneity at the individual agent level. Equation 3 shows the multivariate regression of crowd avoidance on the HBM plus gender and age, parameterized from Table V. In Equation 3 we have included those variables with odds ratios statistically different from 1; x Gen = 1 corresponds to males, and x Age = 1 corresponds to > 65 years of age, in accordance with Table V. Equation 4 shows the probability of avoiding crowds for a male below the age of 65 who perceives the benefits of avoiding crowds to be high. ",

Our comparison across survey periods in Table II revealed a significant decrease in Perceived Susceptibility of contracting H1N1 in the later months of the pandemic. Over this same period, the Perceived Severity of H1N1 and the Perceived Benefits and Perceived Barriers of both protective behaviors did not significantly change. We observed that Perceived Susceptibility fell during the waning epidemic, while the other variables appeared insensitive to the prevalence of disease.
