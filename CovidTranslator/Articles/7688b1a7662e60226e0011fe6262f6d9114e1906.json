Synthetic biology includes technologies for DNA synthesis and assembly of fragments of DNA for gene synthesis, sometimes referred to as synthetic genomics. Craig Venter, a pioneer in this area, has described synthetic biology in a video (http://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=dvBV2qnSZwo). Genome engineering includes approaches to construct synthetic chromosomes and goes beyond traditional genetic engineering. Metabolic engineering can be used to manipulate metabolic pathways for correction of metabolic disorders and can also be applied to microorganisms to produce chemicals more efficiently than by genetic engineering.

They then transferred the completed genome into the shell of another bacterium, Mycoplasma capricolum , whose own DNA had been removed. The transplanted genome 'booted up' the host cell and took over its biological machinery. After 30 cell divisions, there were billions of synthetic bacteria in the laboratory dishes -all of them making exclusively the biological molecules associated with M. mycoides . The only DNA in the cells is the designed synthetic DNA sequence, including 'watermark' sequences and other designed gene deletions and polymorphisms, and mutations acquired during the building process. The new cells have expected phenotypic properties and are capable of continuous selfreplication. The synthetic bacteria have 14 'watermark sequences' attached to their genome -inert stretches of DNA added to distinguish them from their natural counterparts.

As an initial step toward achieving this goal, synthetic proteins have been created that can function in Escherichia coli . Using a so-called binary code method that relies on strategic placement of polar and non-polar residues, a team of scientists made more than a million stably folded strings of amino acids from genetic sequences distinct from those known to occur naturally [11] . They then screened these synthetic proteins in dozens of E. coli strains missing essential genes, identifying artificial proteins that could substitute for the organism's own proteins. They are molecular machines that function quite well within a living organism even though they were designed from scratch and expressed from artificial genes. They found that 18 of the artificial proteins could rescue the growth of 4 E. coli mutant strains missing the essential enzyme-coding genes serB, gltA, ilvA or fes. The information encoded in these artificial genes does not come from and is not significantly related to information encoded by natural genes, and yet the end result is a living, functional microbe. The synthetic proteins are substantially less active and may function by different mechanisms than the natural proteins they replace. Nonetheless, co-expression of several novel proteins rescues a strain in which multiple natural genes were deleted simultaneously. This work suggests that the construction of artificial genomes capable of sustaining cell life is feasible. Synthesis of therapeutic proteins by this approach has not been explored as yet.",

An example of the potential application of this approach is brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme), which is one of the most challenging cancers, and efforts to cure it have failed in over 100 years of history of modern neurosurgery. The challenge is due to complete eradication required for cure as even a few residual cells multiply rapidly with recurrence of the tumor that kills the patient. Response to conventional treatments such as surgical resection and chemotherapy varies according to the characteristics of individual tumors, but none are curative.",

The findings of this commission were published in December 2010. 'The recommendations detailed in this report provide a publicly accountable basis for ensuring that the field of synthetic biology advances to improve human health and public welfare with processes in place to identify, assess, monitor, and mitigate risks on an ongoing basis as the field matures. Risk assessment should precede field release of the products of synthetic biology. Ongoing assessment and review is required in several areas to avoid unnecessary limits on science and social progress, and to ensure appropriate restrictions to protect individual safety and our shared environment. Ongoing dialogue about concerns regarding the implications of synthetic biology for humans, other species, nature, and the environment should continue as synthetic biology develops from its infancy to a fully mature field of scientific inquiry and innovation' [38] .",
