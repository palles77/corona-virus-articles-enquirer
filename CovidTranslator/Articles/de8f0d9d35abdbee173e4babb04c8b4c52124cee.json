            "text": "Almost a century ago, several authors suggested that vitamin C might affect respiratory infections. However, not much attention was paid to this topic until 1970, when Nobel laureate Linus Pauling wrote the bestseller 'Vitamin C and the Common Cold.' His claim that gramdose vitamin C supplementation would prevent and alleviate colds was not based on any studies of his own but on previously published trials. One result of his activity was that a series of placebo-controlled trials was carried out to determine whether large doses of vitamin C would affect colds [1] [2] [3] . The new trials found that $ 1 g day 21 vitamin C supplementation had no consistent effect on common cold incidence ( Figure 1 ). Consequently, these trials did not support the suggestion that regular vitamin C ingestion would increase the resistance of the general Western population to colds. However, some evidence indicated that vitamin C could have moderate preventive effects in restricted groups, such as subjects with particularly low dietary intake or those suffering from acute physical stress [1, 3] . However, the placebo-controlled trials found that the duration and symptoms of colds were reduced by $ 1 g day 21 vitamin C, although, the quantitative results diverge sharply (Figure 1 ). In most of the trials, the decrease in morbidity was between 5% and 35%, with a mean of 23%. Evidently, the main question should not be to decide whether a decrease of 23% is clinically important but to identify the factors that could affect the magnitude of the benefit. For example, even in the gram-dose region, there is a trend for trials with 2-4 g day 21 doses to show greater benefit when compared to trials using 1 g day 21 [1, 2] . All trials summed up in Figure 1 used regular daily vitamin C supplementation. If the main goal is to alleviate the symptoms, it appears more rational to administer vitamin C therapeutically, starting immediately after the early symptoms; however, few such trials have been carried out.",

            "text": "Vitamin C could also affect lower respiratory tract infections. Several early reports suggested that vitamin C might hasten convalescence from pneumonia, a hypothesis that was supported by one placebo-controlled trial [3] . Three controlled trials with human subjects reported a significantly lower incidence of pneumonia in vitamin C supplemented groups [3, 4] , suggesting that under certain conditions, vitamin C might affect susceptibility to pneumonia. Studies with guinea pigs and other animals have also found that vitamin C modifies susceptibility to various viral and bacterial infections, including pneumococcal infections [3, 4] . Recently, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and two reports of vitamin C studies are of particular interest in this regard. Vitamin C increased the resistance of chick embryo tracheal organ cultures [5] and broiler chicks [6] to infection caused by an avian coronavirus.",

Nevertheless, in the intensive search for molecules participating in the defence against viruses and bacteria, vitamin C has not been particularly interesting because it is not specifically and firmly linked to any single immunological mechanism. Still, it is possible that, as a major physiological antioxidant, vitamin C has nonspecific protective effects on diverse parts of the immune system [1, 7] . During infections, phagocytes generate a set of oxidizing agents that have antimicrobial effects but if released into the extracellular medium, the oxidants can be harmful to the host [1, 11] . The oxidizing agents seem to have an important role in the pathogenesis of certain viral infections [11] . A number of studies have found that vitamin C levels are decreased in plasma, leucocytes and in urine during various infections, including the common cold and pneumonia [1, 3] . These findings support the notion that oxidants generated during infections react with vitamin C, and the vitamin could thereby protect the host against the potential harm done by the oxidants.",
