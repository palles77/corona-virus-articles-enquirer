The bronchiolitis group was characterized by a higher percentage of cough, a lower percentage of chest pain and lower blood levels of inflammatory markers. Common pathogens in the GGO group were not significantly different from those in the other 2 groups. Unlike that observed in the consolidation group, complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema was not observed in the bronchiolitis or GGO group. Outcome variables were similar in the 3 groups.",

Chest radiography is usually used in combination with a constellation of compatible symptoms or signs, such as cough and sputum production to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia. 2, 3 Computed tomography (CT) is useful when the plain chest radiograph does not reveal findings that explain the patient's clinical presentation. 4 CT images can provide more detailed information regarding lung parenchyma, 1 suggest specific causative agents, 5 rule out noninfectious pneumonia 5 and detect other underlying conditions. 4 Thus, CT provides additional benefits for the diagnosis of CAP and aids its typing. 2 In particular, when performed early, CT can affect the diagnosis and clinical management of CAP in the emergency department. 4 Accordingly, the use of CT in patients with suspected CAP can be expected to increase in real world practice.",

A considerable number of studies on the CT findings of CAP triggered by different pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, [6] [7] [8] Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9, 10 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, [11] [12] [13] [14] Chlamydia pneumoniae 14, 15 and Legionella pneumophila, 16, 17 have been published. Patients with CAP attributed to a specific pathogen present with more than 1 CT pattern, although 1 of these patterns predominates. 5 CAP has been classically divided into 3 patterns based on CT findings, that is, consolidation-predominant, peribronchial nodules-predominant and ground-glass opacity (GGO)-predominant. 5 However, data on relationships between the clinical and microbiologic features of CAP and CT findings are scarce. In CAP, pure or nearly pure GGO lesions are uncommon regardless of causative pathogens, 16, 18 and a CT finding multiple centrilobular nodules is also rare. 19 We hypothesized that the clinical manifestations of patients with CAP are related to CT findings, and thus, we compared the clinical features and microbiologic data of CAP patients classified based on CT findings.",

The mechanisms responsible for centrilobular nodules or tree-in-bud pattern in some patients and consolidation or GGO in others can be explained by the up-or down-regulations of host cell-mediated immunity, respectively. 28 In a previous study, the rate of diffuse bronchiolitis was reported to be 1.2% among community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections. 19 The difference between this rate and the value found in the present study for the bronchiolitis pattern is explained by the different definitions used. In the present study, bronchiolitis was defined as either the presence of centrilobular nodules or a tree-in-bud pattern in most lesions with or without GGO or consolidation in the present study, whereas, in the previous study, diffuse acute infectious bronchiolitis was defined as multiple centrilobular nodules in 4 or more lobes. 19 However, no previous study has addressed the clinical manifestations of the bronchiolitis or bronchiolitis-predominant CAP. As expected based on published findings, 19,30 our bronchiolitis group exhibited a clinically less severe form of CAP characterized by lower levels of inflammatory markers and the absence of complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema.

The pathophysiology of GGO includes incomplete alveolar filling by inflammatory cells or exudate, pulmonary edema secondary to infection leaving air in alveoli or interstitial infiltrates of inflammatory cells. 5 The resolving stage of lobar pneumonia can also exhibit a GGO appearance as alveolar aeration is restored. In previous studies, the rate of GGO in CAP was found to depend on the pathogen, that is, 19% for viral infections, 31 17% for legionella pneumonia 16 and 4% in pneumococcal pneumonia. 8 However, in the present study, the prevalence of causative agents in the GGO and consolidation group were similar. In part, this difference might have arisen only because the CAP patients underwent throat or nasopharyngeal swab testing for respiratory viruses. A GGO pattern on CT is clinically associated with the more frequent use of systemic corticosteroids and the lack of complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema and pleural drainage. In the present study, the use of corticosteroids was determined by attending physicians, and the reasons why they were administered could not be ascertained. However, we speculate corticosteroids were administered to patients with a GGO pattern because the possibility of a noninfectious condition, such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, was not excluded.As noted earlier, the bronchiolitis and GGO groups had their own clinical features. On the contrary, initial antimicrobial treatment in the bronchiolitis or GGO group was not significantly different from the consolidation group. This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that because this study was retrospective, antibiotic therapy was determined by treating physician\u2032s judgement and the CAP guidelines. 3 Consequently, third-generation cephalosporin-or ampicillin-sulbactambased antibiotic therapy was most commonly used in the present study. Given that M. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen in the bronchiolitis group, fluoroquinolone with or without aminoglycoside tended to be more frequently administered in the bronchiolitis group than the consolidation group.The present study has several limitations. First, it was retrospectively conducted in a single institution, which suggests the possibility of selection bias. As described in a previous study, 21 emergency physicians at our institution that encountered patients with suspected pneumonia tended to confirm the presence of pneumonia and transfer them from the emergency department to the internal medicine department. For this reason, most, though not all, CAP patients underwent a CT scan, although it is usually not necessary for the diagnosis of CAP. Second, some tests for causative pathogens were not performed in all CAP patients, only a proportion of patients underwent evaluation for respiratory viruses. Third, because of the retrospective design of the study, therapeutic decision-making, including the selection of antibiotics, was determined by attending physicians. Finally, the numbers of patients in the bronchiolitis and GGO groups were too small to allow us to reach definitive conclusions. Thus, we suggest a large-scale prospective study be performed to confirm our findings.",

On the other hand, the GGO group was similar to the consolidation group in terms of causative microorganisms, severity and prognosis, but unlike the consolidation group, was not found to be associated with complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema. However, bronchiolitis and GGO groups were similar to the consolidation group in terms of 30-day or in-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay. ",
