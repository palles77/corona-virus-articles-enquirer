We previously demonstrated that the IFN-\u03b3 response at the signaling and gene expression levels is temporally extended in primary mouse hippocampal neurons, as compared to the transient response of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). We hypothesize that the protracted kinetics of STAT1 phosphorylation in IFN-\u03b3-treated neurons are due to extended receptor activation and/or delayed STAT1 dephosphorylation in the nucleus. Here, we show that in response to IFN-\u03b3, the Janus kinases (JAK1/JAK2) associated with the neuronal IFN-\u03b3 receptor complex remain active for an extended period as compared to MEF. Experimental inactivation of JAK1/JAK2 in neurons after IFN-\u03b3 treatment did not reverse the extended STAT1 phosphorylation phenotype. These results suggest that the extended kinetics of neuronal IFN-\u03b3 signaling are a product of distinct negative feedback mechanisms operating at both the receptor and within the nucleus.",

This, in turn, results in the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the IFNGR1 subunits. Upon docking to the phosphorylated IFNGR1 subunit, Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT)-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 701 (pY701), resulting in its homodimerization. The phospho-STAT1 homodimer is then translocated to the nucleus and binds to Gamma Activated Sequence (GAS) elements within the promoters of IFN-\u03b3-responsive genes, thus influencing their expression. While other signal transduction factors can respond to IFN-\u03b3 (such as STAT3), STAT1 is the primary mediator of the IFN-\u03b3 signal in most cells studied to date.",

            "text": "Chronic activation of the IFN-\u03b3 pathway can be cytotoxic, and therefore the cellular response is negatively regulated at two primary locations: i) at the cell membrane, via deactivation of IFN-\u03b3 receptor-associated JAK1 and JAK2; and ii) in the nucleus, via dephosphorylation of activated STAT1 (reviewed in Wormald et al., 2006) . These mechanisms typically involve the expression and activity of both IFN-\u03b3-responsive proteins as well as constitutively-expressed phosphatases. For example, the expression of Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS)-1 is induced in response to IFN-\u03b3; it binds to IFN-\u03b3 receptor-associated JAKs and thereby prevents continued phosphorylation of the IFNGR1 subunits (Endo et al., 1997; Giordanetto and Kroemer, 2003; Wormald et al., 2006; Yasukawa et al., 1999) , effectively suppressing the response to IFN-\u03b3 at the level of the receptor. In the nucleus, the IFN-\u03b3 response is modulated by the dephosphorylation of STAT1. When dephosphorylated, the STAT1 homodimer disassembles and loses its ability to act as a transcription factor. Nuclear STAT1 phosphatase activity has been attributed to a splice isoform of TC-PTP, known as TC45 (ten Hoeve et al., 2002) . Previous studies have demonstrated that the IFN-\u03b3 response in non-neuronal cells is typically attenuated by these negative feedback mechanisms within 4-20 hours of IFN-\u03b3 exposure (Wormald et al., 2006) .",

To address this gap, our lab quantitatively compared the responses of primary hippocampal neurons and primary fibroblasts to IFN-\u03b3, and found that the responses of these two cell types were markedly distinct. STAT1 phosphorylation in IFN-\u03b3-treated neurons was delayed and decreased in intensity as compared to the more widely-studied fibroblasts, which resulted in parallel effects on IFN-\u03b3-responsive gene expression. These data underscored the importance of both the timing and magnitude of STAT signaling pathways in orchestrating the cell-specific response to exogenous IFN-\u03b3. Moreover, the duration of the response of primary CNS neurons at the level of signal transduction and IFN-\u03b3-responsive gene expression was significantly longer that that of primary fibroblasts. Specifically, after a 30-minute exposure to IFN-\u03b3, phosphorylated STAT1 was detectable for over 48 hours in neurons, whereas it was undetectable by 24 hours post-exposure in MEF. Consistent with this observation, IFN-\u03b3-driven gene expression in neurons followed similar kinetics (Rose et al., 2007) .",

Using this approach, any phospho-STAT1 detected after the addition of the inhibitor would represent STAT1 that was activated during the 30 min IFN-\u03b3 treatment, and that had not yet been dephosphorylated. Therefore, a decline in phospho-STAT1 levels post-inhibitor addition would indicate a rapid deactivation of STAT1 (as no additional neuronal STAT1 is phosphorylated de novo upon inhibitor treatment; Figure 4b ). Figures 5b and 5c demonstrate that without JAK inhibitor I treatment, STAT1 phosphorylation was detectable (~60% of maximal activation) in neurons 48 hrs post-IFN-\u03b3 treatment, whereas it was only weakly detectable (~10% of maximal activation) in MEF at the same timepoint ( Fig. 5b and 5c ; \"no inhibitor\" 48 hr lanes). When JAK inhibitor I was added after the IFN-\u03b3 was removed, both cell types demonstrated an overall drop in STAT1 activation (Figure 5b ). However, in the presence of JAK inhibitor I, STAT1 phosphorylation was still detectable in neuron lysates 48 hrs post-IFN-\u03b3 treatment (~12% of maximal activation), whereas it was barely detectable in MEF only 24 hrs post-IFN-\u03b3 treatment (~2% of maximal activation), and undetectable at 48 hrs (Figures 5b and 5c ).",

First, these kinases are required for the initiation of IFN-\u03b3 signaling (Neubauer et al., 1998; Rodig et al., 1998) . Second, not only do they phosphorylate the R1 subunit of the IFNGR complex (providing docking sites for STAT1 recruitment), they also phosphorylate and activate the recruited STAT1 molecules, which then translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of IFN-\u03b3-responsive genes. The activation of JAK2, and to a lesser extent, JAK1, was prolonged in neurons after a 30 min exposure to IFN-\u03b3. This would allow for an extended duration of STAT1 activation in two ways: 1) continued phosphorylation of the receptor complex provides continuous docking sites to recruit STAT1; and 2) the recruited STAT1 continues to be phosphorylated by the active kinases. These observations suggest that the neuronal IFNGR complex subunits remain stably associated in the absence of exogenously-added IFN-\u03b3. The receptor complex may remain bound to IFN-\u03b3, or there may be differences in the internalization and/or degradation of the neuronal IFN-\u03b3 receptor.",

Using JAK inhibitor I, we dissected the contribution of an active receptor from phospho-STAT1 longevity: addition of the drug inhibits de novo STAT1 phosphorylation; thus, phospho-STAT1 detected after inhibitor addition was phosphorylated during the IFN-\u03b3 treatment period. If the extended STAT1 phoshorylation in neurons was due solely to a delay in the dephosphorylation of STAT1, we would expect to observe the phospho-STAT1 signal for longer durations after the addition of the inhibitor. Alternatively, if the extended STAT1 phoshorylation in neurons was due solely to prolonged receptor activity, we would expect to see a lack of phospho-STAT1 signal at later time-points post-inhibitor addition. We observed a prolonged neuronal STAT1 signal post-inhibitor addition as compared to MEF; however, the signal was not as strong as observed in inhibitor-untreated cells. This suggests that a delay in neuronal STAT1 dephosphorylation is not the sole mechanism. Taken together, these results suggest that both extended receptor activation and a delay in STAT1 dephosphorylation contribute to the prolonged STAT1 phosphorylation observed in IFN-\u03b3-treated neurons.",
