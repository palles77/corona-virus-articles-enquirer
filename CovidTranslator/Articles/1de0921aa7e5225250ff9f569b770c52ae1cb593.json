Previously, avian pneumovirus was the sole member of this recently assigned genus, hence the provisional name for the newly discovered virus: human metapneumovirus. The clinical symptoms of the children from whom the virus was isolated were similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus infection, ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Serological studies showed that by the age of five years, virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years.",

            "text": "The Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae subfamilies of the Paramyxoviridae family include several major pathogens of humans and animals. The Pneumovirinae are taxonomically divided in the Pneumovirus and the Metapneumovirus genera 1 . Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), the type species of the Pneumovirus genus, is the single most important cause of lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) during infancy and early childhood worldwide 2, 3 . Other members of the Pneumovirus genus include bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV), ovine respiratory syncytial virus (oRSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). Avian pneumovirus (APV), previously known as turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV), is the etiological agent of an upper RTI of turkeys 4, 5 and the sole member of the recently assigned Metapneumovirus genus 1 . Until now, metapneumoviruses have not been associated with infections or disease in mammals. The classification of the two genera is based primarily on their gene constellation; metapneumoviruses lack non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2 and the gene order is different from that of pneumoviruses (RSV, 3\u2032-NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L-5\u2032; APV, 3\u2032-N-P-M-F-M2-SH-G-L-5\u2032) 6-8 . In the past few decades, many etiological agents of respiratory tract illnesses (RTI) have been identified 9, 10 . However, a proportion of these illnesses still cannot be attributed to known pathogens. We have now isolated a previously undiscovered paramyxovirus from nasopharyngeal aspirate samples taken from 28 epidemiologically unrelated children in the Netherlands suffering from RTI during the past 20 years. Of the patients, 27 were below the age of 5 years and 13 of these were infants between the ages of 0 and 12 months. The clinical symptoms of these children were largely similar to the RTI caused by hRSV, ranging from mild respiratory problems to severe cough, bronchiolitis and pneumonia, often accompanied by high fever, myalgia and vomiting. Some of these patients were hospitalized and needed mechanical ventilation.",

All viruses were isolated from samples collected in the winter months. The unidentified virus isolates replicated slowly in tertiary monkey kidney (tMK) cells, very poorly in Vero cells and A549 cells, and could not be propagated in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells or chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). The cytopathic effects induced by these virus isolates were virtually indistinguishable from those caused by hRSV, with characteristic syncytia formation followed by rapid internal disruption of the cells and subsequent detachment from the culture plate. The cells usually displayed cytopathic effects at days 10-14 post inoculation, slightly later than the cytopathic effects induced by hRSV-containing specimens (data not shown). After 14 days of virus propagation, the viral titers in the cultures were on average 10,000 TCID 50 (50% tissue culture infectious doses) per ml. Supernatants of infected tMK cells were used for electron microscopy analysis, which revealed the presence of paramyxovirus-like pleiomorphic particles in the range of 150-600 nm, with short envelope projections in the range of 13-17 nm (Fig. 1 ). Similar to some other paramyxoviruses such as selected hRSV and parainfluenza virus isolates, nucleocapsids were rarely observed.",

To this end, we infected tMK cells with one of the virus isolates (isolate 00-1) or with hPIV-1 that served as a control. We sequenced 20 differentially displayed bands specific for the unidentified virus. When we used the deduced aminoacid sequences to search for homologies against sequences in the Genbank database using the BLAST software (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST), 10 of 20 fragments displayed resemblance to APV/TRTV sequences. These 10 fragments were located in the genes coding for the nucleoprotein (N; fragments 1 and 2), the matrix protein (M; fragment 3), the fusion protein (F; fragments 4, 5, 6 and 7) and the polymerase protein (L; fragments 8, 9 and 10) (Fig. 2) . We can exclude the possibility of contamination of the human samples with APV/TRTV as we do not have this virus in our laboratories. We next designed PCR primers to complete the sequence information for the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome based on our RAP-PCR fragments as well as published leader and trailer sequences for the Pneumovirinae 7 (Fig. 2 ). In total, we have generated 5.7 kilobases of sequence information of the viral genome. Analyses of the sequences of these fragments revealed the absence of NS1 and NS2 open reading frames (ORFs) at the extreme 3\u2032 end of the viral genome ( Fig.  3a) and positioning of the putative F ORF immediately adjacent to the putative M ORF (Fig. 3b ). This genomic organization resembles that of the metapneumovirus APV, which is consistent with the sequence homology. It should be noted however that the genomic organization of hMPV cannot be simply deduced from that of APV, and requires further analysis.",

During the three weeks follow-up, none of the birds showed clinical signs or virus replication as determined by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from the throat and cloaca swabs. In contrast, the virus replicated efficiently in the respiratory tract of all four monkeys as shown by RT-PCR of RNA isolated from the throat swabs. Whereas viral RNA was not detectable in samples taken at day 1, virus replication peaked between days 2 and 8 after inoculation. Two of the monkeys presented with mild upper respiratory tract signs that upon histological analysis proved to be associated with suppurative rhinitis (data not shown). Although the detailed pathological, virological and immunological analyses are incomplete at present, these preliminary data indicate that hMPV is a primate pathogen associated with respiratory disease.",

The nucleotide sequence identity between isolates within a cluster was 90-100% for all four fragments, whereas the sequence identity for isolates between the two clusters was 81-88%. Variation was similar for the N, M, F and L fragments and did not seem to correlate with the year of virus isolation (indicated by the first two numbers in the name of the isolates).

The children presented with clinical symptoms reminiscent of those caused by hRSV infection, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. As is seen with hRSV-infected children, very young hMPV-infected children appeared to require hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Whether hMPV infection causes RTI cannot be formally concluded from the present data. Most im-portantly, acute and convalescent paired sera were not available for the children from whom hMPV was isolated. However, considering that no other virus was identified in any of the 28 hMPV-infected children and that hMPV was not isolated from 400 samples taken from children under two years of age without respiratory symptoms (not shown), a causal relationship seems likely. The experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques supports this conclusion.",

Genetic analyses of the putative N, M, P and F genes revealed that hMPV showed a higher sequence homology to the recently proposed genus Metapneumovirus (average of 66%) as compared to the genus Pneumovirus (average of 30%) and a genomic organization that is most similar to APV/TRTV. In contrast to the genomic organization of the pneumoviruses (3'-NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-L-5\u2032), metapneumoviruses lack NS1 and NS2 genes and have a different positioning of the genes between M and L (3'-N-P-M-F-M2-SH-G-L-5\u2032). The absence of ORFs between the M and F genes in this virus and the lack of NS1 and NS2 genes adjacent to N is in agreement with it being the first identified non-avian member of the Metapneumovirus genus. However, until sequence information becomes available for the entire genomic organization of hMPV, a definitive classification of this virus is not possible.",

New diagnostic assays based on virus detection and serology should allow a more detailed analysis of the incidence and both clinical and economic impact of this newly identified human virus. To get an idea of the potential impact of this virus for RTI we have tested nasopharyngeal aspirate samples collected during the 2000 winter season from children presenting with RTI, at Erasmus University Medical Center that were negative for RSV, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1-3, human rhinovirus and Corona virus (HCV-229E and HCV-OC43). Seven of the 68 samples tested proved to be positive for hMPV by RT-PCR, indicating that for the 2000 winter season approximately 10% of the unexplained RTI may be associated with hMPV. The minor differences between our IFA and virus neutralization results (5 samples) may be due to several factors; only IgG serum antibodies are detected in IFA, virus neutralization antibodies are generally directed against surface glycoproteins, the sensitivities of the two assays may differ and different serotypes of hMPV may exist. The latter suggestion is of particular interest, since only one isolate (00-1) was used for IFA and virus neutralization, potentially giving rise to false negative results using sera raised against genetically distinct hMPV isolates such as those shown in Fig. 5 .",

First of all, many virology laboratories use continuous cell lines for virus isolation, in which hMPV does not seem to replicate efficiently. Second, hMPV displays very slow replication kinetics in vitro, and may therefore have remained undetected. Third, replication of hMPV in-vitro appeared to be trypsin dependent and many of the earlier studies to find respiratory pathogens did not use trypsin. Finally, the apparent lack of cross-reactivity in the serologic assays we performed and the low nucleotide sequence homology to known human viral pathogens make unlikely the detection of hMPV with standard serological or molecular techniques. Pringle and Eglin have described serological evidence for an unidentified 'PVM-like' pneumovirus that frequently infects humans 19 . We feel it is unlikely that hMPV is the PVM-like-virus described by Pringle and Eglin for a number of reasons. First, high-titer sera specific for several paramyxoviruses, including PVM and RSV, failed to react in immunofluorescence studies with hMPV-infected tMK cells as targets (data not shown). Second, most of our hMPV-positive human serum samples did not have PVM-specific antibodies as measured by ELISA. Furthermore, PVM (and supposedly a PVMlike virus) has hemagglutinating activity, whereas we have no evidence that hMPV does. Finally, the genomic organization of PVM is similar to that of RSV and thus different from that of hMPV.",
