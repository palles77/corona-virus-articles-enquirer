            "text": "The expansion of genetic diversity among coronaviruses and their consequent ability to cause disease in human beings is mainly achieved through infecting peridomestic animals, which serve as intermediate hosts, nurturing recombination and mutation events. 9 The spike glycoprotein (S glycoprotein), which attaches the virion to the host cell membrane, is postulated to play a dominant role in host range restriction. 10 While SARS-CoV infects type 2 pneumocytes and ciliated bronchial epithelial cells utilizing angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as a receptor, MERS-CoV exploits dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a transmembrane glycoprotein, to infect type 2 pneumocytes and unciliated bronchial epithelial cells. [11] [12] [13] [14] In general, coronaviruses first replicate in epithelial cells of the respiratory and enteric cells, which leads to cytopathic changes. 15 Thorough studies have not yet been conducted to elucidate the molecular basis of the pathogenicity of 2019-nCoV. However, preliminary data obtained through whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA extracted from host cell-depleted nasopharyngeal and sputum samples and subsequent bioinformatics analyses have shown that the novel virus is phylogenetically related to SARS-related coronaviruses first isolated in Chinese horseshoe bats during the period of 2015 to 2017. 16, 17 It has also been hypothesized that the novel virus might use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as a receptor similar to SARS-CoV. 18 Unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, primary human airway epithelial cells provide better growth conditions for 2019-nCoV than standard tissue culture cells. 6 Epidemiology A series of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were initially reported by the Health Commission of Hubei province, China, on December 31, 2019 ( Fig  1) . 19 Although 27 patients were initially announced to be afflicted with this mysterious disease, the number rose to 41 with seven critically ill patients; one death was noted in the subsequent report on Janu-ary 11, 2020. 20 The Chinese authorities reporting to WHO stated that some of the patients were operating dealers or vendors in the Huanan seafood market, which was subsequently reported to be selling live and freshly slaughtered hunted animals. 16, 21 Several reports of clusters of cases among families and infection of 16 health care workers pointed to human-to-human transmission of the virus. 16, 22, 23 Despite recognition of the outbreak within a few weeks by the Chinese using their efficient surveillance network and laboratory infrastructure, efforts to prevent the spread of this virus were not sufficient; as of February 3, 2020, at least 17 496 cases with a death toll of 362 in more than 25 countries have been reported (Fig 2) . 24 With a crowded population eclipsing that of New York City by more than 2.5 million and its role as one of China's major transportation hubs, the city of Wuhan was the ideal breeding ground for an outbreak. 25 Peak travel season due to the Chinese New Year was probably an important factor that led to the global spread of the infection.",

Furthermore, based on experience, proper precautionary measures to prevent nosocomial transmission of the virus is mandatory; the majority of patients with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV had become infected in health care settings. 28 Considering the plethora of comorbid conditions present in hospital populations, dire complications could arise in the setting of an outbreak.",

            "text": "Overall, infection caused by the 2019-nCoV shares many clinical similarities with infection caused by SARS-CoV. A typical human coronavirus has an incubation period of 2-4 days; it is estimated to be 3-6 days for the 2019-nCoV, and 4-6 days for SARS-CoV. 15, 16, 29, 30 Infection with 2019-nCoV, similar to SARS-CoV, presents with non-specific symptoms such as malaise, fever, and dry cough at the prodromal phase. 16, 29, 30 In a study of 425 patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, the mean duration from illness onset to the first medical visit was 5.8 (95% CI 4.3 to 7.5) days for cases with disease onset before January 1, 2020, and 4.6 (95% CI 4.1 to 5.1) days for patients with illness onset between January 1 and 11. 26 A report by Huang, et al, on 41 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection who were admitted to Wuhan Hospital indicated that fever (98%), cough (76%), dyspnea (55%), and myalgia or fatigue (44%) were the most common presenting signs and symptoms. 30 In another report from China, these findings were corroborated. 29 In contrast to patients with typical human coronavirus infections, few of those affected with the re v i e w novel coronavirus had upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms (eg, sore throat, rhinorrhea). Unlike SARS-CoV, intestinal presentations (eg, diarrhea) seem to be infrequent in patients with 2019-nCoV. [29] [30] [31] Given the similarities between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, it is tempting to speculate about viremia and affected tissues beyond the respiratory tract. However, we are not aware of any data on this yet.",
