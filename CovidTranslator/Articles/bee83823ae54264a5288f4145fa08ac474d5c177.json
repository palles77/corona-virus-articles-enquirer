We examined whether the use of a BlackBerry-based daily symptom diary would detect 95% or more of exacerbations and enable characterization of seasonal differences among them.",

Alerts were triggered when symptom changes, missed diary transmissions, or medical care for a respiratory problem occurred. Participant encounters were initiated if COPD exacerbations were suspected. Participants used their BlackBerrys to report returns to normal breathing. Results: Participants transmitted 99.9% of 28,514 possible daily diaries. All 191 (2.5/participant-year) COPD exacerbations meeting Anthonisen criteria were detected. During 148 of the 191 exacerbations (78%, 1.97/participant-year), patients were hospitalized and/or ordered prednisone, an antibiotic, or both. Respiratory viruses were detected in 78 of the 191 exacerbations (41%). Those coinciding with a respiratory viral infection averaged 12.0 days, and those without averaged 8.9 days ( P , .04), with no difference in Anthonisen score. Respiratory symptom scores before exacerbations and after normal breathing return showed no differences. Exacerbations were more frequent during the Christmas period than the rest of the year but were not more frequent than in the rest of winter alone. Conclusions: Smartphone-based collection of COPD symptom diaries enables near-complete identifi cation of exacerbations at inception. Exacerbation rates in the Christmas season do not reach levels that necessitate changes in disease management. CHEST 2013; 144(2):507-514",

Secondary analyses compared the annualized rates of COPD exacerbation and the proportion of exacerbations coinciding with RVIs during two Christmas periods, two rest-of-winter periods, and the period from May 1, 2008, to November 30, 2008. Differences in exacerbation rates between periods were tested using a x 2 test, in which the observed rate of exacerbations/participant-year was compared with the number expected across all time periods or between the Christmas and rest-of-winter periods. Exacerbation length and Anthonisen scores with and without the presence of RVIs were examined using a Student t test. To determine whether there was a difference among the symptom levels before, during, and after an exacerbation, daily diary data for questions 1 to 4 (e-Appendix 1) were analyzed with a repeated-measures analysis of variance with two factors: before/during/after and question. The analysis was repeated for the before and after scores only to determine if symptom levels returned to baseline after an exacerbation.",

However, a BlackBerry-based system has been used in other COPD studies, including a large, multicountry clinical trial, with 91% compliance. 24 Our participants reported when their breathing returned to normal after an exacerbation using a supplementary BlackBerry diary question. Analysis of diary symptom data established that this self-assessment was accurate, suggesting that assessments of their respiratory health by patients with COPD are perceptive. The Christmas period, as we defi ned it, involves an elevated exacerbation risk for patients with COPD, but this was not signifi cant compared with the rest of winter. Since this study was completed, two reports of seasonal patterns of COPD exacerbations in major clinical trials, TORCH 15 and Prevention of Exacerbations With Tiotropium in COPD (POET-COPD), have been published. 25 In both, in the northern hemisphere exacerbations occurred most frequently in December and January. The original characterization of a Christmas peak in COPD exacerbations 12 examined data for 209,274 ED presentations for COPD in Ontario, Canada, over a 4-year period (summary data provided in e- Table 1 ). In every year, the last week of the year from Christmas Day to New Year's Eve had the highest number of events. That the existence of a specifi c Christmas effect as opposed to an elevated risk over the broader period can only be demonstrated in large administrative data sets suggests that preparing patients with COPD for the risks One baseline nasal-fl uid specimen (2.5%) and seven baseline sputum specimens (15%) were virus positive, all for rhinovirus.",
