Finally, each child in the non-AOM group was examined at the study clinic on a follow-up visit after an average of 12 days when the symptoms had already subsided. Inclusion in the AOM group required a diagnosis of AOM, which was based on three overall criteria. First, middle-ear fluid had to be detected by means of pneumatic otoscopic examination that showed at least two of the following tympanic membrane findings: bulging position, decreased or absent mobility, abnormal color or opacity not due to scarring, or air-fluid interfaces. Second, at least one of the following acute inflammatory signs in the tympanic membrane had to be present: distinct erythematous patches or streaks, or increased vascularity over full, bulging, or yellow tympanic membrane.

Our data are supported by murine models demonstrating that the risk of AOM is highest following nasal inoculation with S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis together compared to S. pneumoniae alone. 23 Interestingly, co-colonization and co-infection with M. catarrhalis may have implications for treatment. \u03b2-Lactamase producing M. catarrhalis can promote resistance to amoxicillin in susceptible S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.

Colonization with NPAHS without bacterial AOM pathogens decreased the risk of AOM. Thus, our data give important support for the protective role of NPAHS for AOM.",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses could be detected in almost all children in our study and expectedly rhinovirus was the most prevalent. Detection of multiple viruses was common in general but no more common in children with AOM than in those without AOM, which is in line with previous data. 7 An interesting observation was that we found no major differences in viral findings in children with and without AOM. At first sight, our observation may seem conflicting with previous studies that have repeatedly shown that the most important viral risk factor for AOM is RSV infection during which roughly 50-70% of young children develop AOM. [6] [7] [8] [31] [32] [33] [34] However, the results of the previous studies have been conflicting regarding the risk of AOM related to other viruses. Chonmaitree et al. actually showed that age was more important risk factor for AOM than any of the viruses. 7 Most of the previous studies have had follow-up during which the development of AOM has been studied in relation to specific viral infection. Notably, our study approach was cross-sectional and children were examined because their parents sought medical care due to suspicion of AOM. In other words, our study approach was the one where physicians encounter symptomatic children with and without AOM in daily practice. Our observation raises a question if differences in host factors play stronger role than differences between viral infections in determining which children develop AOM during RTI. Previously, Casselbrant et al. have shown that genetics determines 73% of risk of otitis media in early childhood. 35 Nonetheless, our results also draw attention to RSV and suggest that RSV contributes to AOM pathogenesis even without nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization. Among children not colonized with bacterial AOM pathogens, the risk of AOM was over 6-fold higher when RSV was detected. In two previous studies, roughly half of AOM patients infected with RSV had negative bacterial culture of middle ear effusion. 8, 36 These observations, including ours, show that RSV has an important role in the pathogenesis of AOM.",

Due to our careful follow-up we can be confident that the non-AOM group did not experience AOM directly following the RTI episode when sampling occurred. Equally important, our non-AOM group had similar symptoms, age distribution, and AOM history as the AOM group. Our extensive virology included detection of virtually all respiratory viruses except influenza C and parainfluenza type 4 viruses which we see as the reason for higher detection rates of viruses than commonly reported in studies of AOM. Furthermore, our use of selective bacterial culture plates is expected to have yielded bacteria more comprehensively than standard plates. 37 Nevertheless, our study is not without limitations. These include limited sample size, which resulted in wide confidence intervals and may have limited our ability to detect otherwise significant associations. Recruitment was based on self-selection and parents were motivated to participate in our AOM treatment trial, which may have affected which viruses were detected. While we did not exclude children according to symptoms, parents whose children experienced the most severe symptoms may have been less likely to participate and on the other hand the non-AOM group may have been more symptomatic than the average child with RTI.",
