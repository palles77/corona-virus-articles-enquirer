            "text": "Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations are associated with viral infections. We wished to determine if respiratory viral infection of children in the community was associated with hospital admissions of patients with exacerbations of COPD. Methods: We collected data over a 45-month period from the Northern Ireland Regional Virus Laboratory and from a general hospital in the same locality. We studied the relationship between upper respiratory infections in children and COPD admissions. We also examined the role of school holidays. Results: Correlations were seen between the frequency of all viral infections in children and the number of adult COPD hospitalizations \u00f0Po0:005\u00de. Subgroup analysis showed distinct relationships with epidemics of; influenza A \u00f0Po0:001\u00de, influenza B \u00f0Po0:05\u00de, adenovirus \u00f0P \u00bc 0:05\u00de, respiratory syncytial virus \u00f0Po0:005\u00de and hospital admissions of patients with COPD. There were significantly fewer COPD admissions in the week after the start of a school holiday period \u00f0Po0:05\u00de. Conclusions: When children are hospitalized with viral respiratory infection there is an associated rise in adult COPD admissions. This suggests exacerbations of COPD are associated with epidemics of respiratory viruses. When children are on school holidays there is a reduction in COPD admissions in the community. This provides further support for respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbations.",

Viruses have been identified in 39-56% of COPD exacerbations.

We obtained data from the regional laboratory. Respiratory samples are routinely screened for viral pathogens on children admitted to hospital. This should reflect the prevalence of upper respiratory infection in children attending hospital at that time.

Patients were admitted to hospital following a decision to admit by a senior Doctor in the emergency department.

[4] [5] [6] There were peaks in COPD admissions where no viruses were identified. These may be related to rhinovirus and human metapnemovirus infection. We did not test for human rhinovirus during this period as it is fastidious and requires molecular detection. Coronavirus similarly was not identified. Human metapneumovirus was only discovered after the study was completed. This underscores the possibility of other endemic viruses which have not yet been identified, but which may contribute to the peaks in numbers of acute exacerbations in adults. 13 The correlation between COPD admissions and the detection of respiratory syncytial virus 2 weeks previously reflects the longer incubation period of respiratory syncytial virus infection. By comparison influenza B was associated with a rise in COPD admissions in the same week; this virus has a shorter incubation period. It is notable that the regression analysis did not identify any particular virus as having an increased relative risk with respect to subsequent COPD admissions when the analysis was performed on data in which seasonal variation in COPD admissions had been removed. Previous investigators have demonstrated no seasonally related differences in disease characteristics for COPD exacerbations, 14 thus in removing seasonal variation prior to analysis the true effects of viral detection on COPD admissions may be been masked.",

There are increased admissions in older people in winter. Fleming showed that acute respiratory infections are associated with hospitalization and increased mortality. 16 This is reflected in the main findings between viruses in children and adult COPD admissions which have been highlighted in this study. It reinforces the health service implications of winter infection and increased exacerbations of COPD. It is also noteworthy that the peak death rate is in patients diagnosed with acute respiratory disease. 16 Influenza has been linked with increased health care use by children and the elderly. There is an excess mortality particularly in the elderly. 17 Several studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness and positive economic aspects of influenza vaccination in children 18, 19 and associated reductions in respiratory morbidity amongst their household contacts. 20 This study supports previous evidence that COPD patients benefit from influenza vaccination.",
