[2] [3] [4] [5] It is a well-known fact that respiratory system continues to grow and develop in the postnatal period, especially during the first 3 years of life making this period exceptionally vulnerable to lung injury. [6] [7] [8] [9] In the last two decades, several innovative methods for the measurement of infant's pulmonary function have been developed and these are playing a vital role in the understanding of normal growth and development of lungs, as well as their longitudinal, follow-up from birth through childhood. 8 9 Longitudinal studies have revealed that lung function at birth and in the first 4-6 years of age tracks the lung function throughout life. 3 5 7 Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) during infancy may affect the normal development of the respiratory system which in turn may have an impact on pulmonary function test. 5 10-12 ARI during early life, especially with viral aetiology, can lead to development of asthma in childhood and COPD in adulthood. 2 3 13 14 Although infection with any of the respiratory viruses during infancy may contribute to the development of asthma and COPD in childhood and adulthood, most of the studies have Open access focused on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) infections. 5 10 13 15-17 Elucidating the effect of ARI on developing pulmonary function in infancy and its tracking in childhood and beyond is an exciting research area. It offers the possibility of identification of infants, who after an ARI episode, maybe at an increased risk of developing chronic respiratory diseases; strategies could then be studied in these infants for the prevention of chronic respiratory morbidity. 16 18 However, the majority of the available literature is on RSV and RV infection, lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and mainly from the Caucasian and Oriental populations. 4 10 13 14 16 19 There is a scarcity of data describing the association of all types of ARIs of any aetiology with the developing pulmonary functions measured by IPFT.",

Another longitudinal study from Perth, Australia, 'The Childhood Asthma Study' observed that infection with RSV or RV in the first year of life was a risk factor for asthma at 5 years of age. 31 A review by Drysdale et al concluded that RSV LRTI during infancy leads to reduced lung function indices, namely FEV 1.0 , FEV/FVC, peak expiratory flow rate and increased residual volume and airway resistance on follow-up even in early adulthood. 32 Korppi et al in a prospective study of 20 years follow-up observed abnormal lung function (lower FEV% and MEF 50 ) in children with a history of RSV infection in infancy. 33 A study from Madrid, Spain, had observed that infection with HMPV during infancy was a strong risk factor for the development of asthma in 3-5 years of age (OR=15.9), followed by RSV bronchiolitis (OR=10.1). 34 In the present study, we observed that all viral ARIs, irrespective of the specific aetiology, influenced the IPFT indices at a later stage.

            "text": "In our cohort, ARI with wheezing during infancy were not associated with IPFT indices in children at 3 years of age. A study from Tucson, Arizona, had observed that wheezing in less than 3 years of age lead to reduced FEV 1.0 , FEV 1.0 /FVC and FEF 25-75 through the age of 16 years. 35 Another study from Finland used impulse oscillometry in 103 children at 5-7 years of age with history of bronchiolitis with wheezing in the first 6 months of life. They concluded that airway resistance or reactance at 5 Hz was abnormal in 20% of children as compared with normal Finnish height-based reference range, but the change was only transient as only 1% of them had persistent abnormality till preschool age. 30 These studies indicate that wheezing during infancy may affect PFT in the long run; we need to follow-up our cohort further to document the effect of wheezing on PFT.",

            "text": "In our cohort, we did not observe significant change in V T and t PTEF /t E in children at 3 years of age with ARI, with or without viral infection during infancy. Studies have reported conflicting results on the influence of ARI/ wheezing on t PTEF /t E . Clarke et al performed a prospective study in 94 infants using TBFVL, and partial expiratory flow-volume concluded that t PTEF /t E is not a very Open access sensitive index in detection of airway obstruction. 36 A plethysmography-based study by Zhang et al in 444 children from 1 to 36 months of age reported that t PTEF /t E was significantly lower in a wheezing group than in the control group. 11 LRTI episodes in our cohort did not show significant association with RTC and RVRTC indices; however, TEF 50 /PTEF was significantly increased in comparison to children who did not have documented ARI during infancy. Evidence in literature both support and refute this observation. A recent study from Cape Town, South Africa, did lung function at 6 weeks and 1 year of age in 648 children and observed that repeated LRTI episodes were independently associated with decreased V T , increased respiratory rate and increased lung clearance index. 12 A study by Strope et al in 159 children (6-18 years of age) with history of LRTI during preschool age observed that boys with a history of wheezy LRTI had lower FEV 1.0 and FEV 1.0 /FVC; however, children without wheezy LRTI did not show any significant impact in PFT indices. 28 Strengths of the study It was a well-designed, prospective birth cohort study with minimal dropout rates and regular follow-up, including almost all respiratory tract infections during infancy. Effort was made to identify the aetiology of all ARIs in infancy, including virus, chlamydia, mycoplasma and other bacteria. Hence, we could also explore the association of infection with viruses like HMPV and HCoV and IPFT indices at a later stage. Instead of focusing only on LRTI, we have included all ARIs of infancy, majority of which were URIs. State-of-the-art IPFTs were performed by trained personnel in keeping with the standard requirements, thus generating robust, reliable data regarding lung functions.",
