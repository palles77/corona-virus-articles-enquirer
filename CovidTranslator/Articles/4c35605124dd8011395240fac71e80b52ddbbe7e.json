            "text": "Infections by RNA viruses such as Influenza, HIV still pose a serious threat to human health despite extensive research on viral diseases. One challenge for producing effective prevention and treatment strategies is high intra-species genetic diversity. As different strains may have different biological properties, characterizing the genetic diversity is thus important to vaccine and drug design. Next-generation sequencing technology enables comprehensive characterization of both known and novel strains and has been widely adopted for sequencing viral populations. However, genome-scale reconstruction of haplotypes is still a challenging problem. In particular, haplotype assembly programs often produce contigs rather than full genomes. As a mutation in one gene can mask the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus, clustering these contigs into genome-scale haplotypes is still needed. Results: We developed a contig binning tool, VirBin, which clusters contigs into different groups so that each group represents a haplotype. Commonly used features based on sequence composition and contig coverage cannot effectively distinguish viral haplotypes because of their high sequence similarity and heterogeneous sequencing coverage for RNA viruses. VirBin applied prototype-based clustering to cluster regions that are more likely to contain mutations specific to a haplotype. The tool was tested on multiple simulated sequencing data with different haplotype abundance distributions and contig sizes, and also on mock quasispecies sequencing data. The benchmark results with other contig binning tools demonstrated the superior sensitivity and precision of VirBin in contig binning for viral haplotype reconstruction.

The genetic diversity could be caused by multiple infections of different strains or by mutations during the virus replication inside the host. In the latter case, the high replication rate, coupled with the low fidelity of the viral polymerase in most RNA viruses, results in a group of different but related strains infecting the same host, which is often termed as \"quasispecies\" (Nowak, 2006) . Previous studies have revealed that patients with chronic virus infections, such as AIDS, are often the reservoir of new viral variants, which are likely produced during the replication process (MacLachlan and Dubovi, 2017) . Because different strains could have very different biological properties such as virulence, transmissibility, antiviral drug resistance etc, characterizing the genetic diversity within viral populations is very important for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. For example, if some strains have developed antiviral drug resistance, they may become the dominant strains and lead to treatment failure. Thus, characterization of the strain-level diversity of viral populations is indispensable for understanding the viruses and is of great clinical importance.",

A relatively straightforward analysis is to understand the local diversity of known viruses by performing read mapping against reference genomes. While this type of analysis can produce a collection of local changes (mutations, insertions, or deletions) of the strains inside the quasispecies, it is not sufficient to infer the biological properties of the strains, which are more likely to be determined by multiple genes. In particular, epistatic interactions are abundant in RNA viruses, where the mutation of one gene masks the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus.

The goal is to assemble short reads from sequenced viral populations into correct haplotype sequences. When the reference genome is available, read mapping can be conducted first to identify local mutations and then cluster the local mutations (or short contigs) into genome-scale haplotypes. When quality reference genomes are not available, which is often the case for emerging viruses such as SARS coronavirus, read mapping is not a very effective strategy to identify all mutations.

High similarity between haplotypes in the same quasispecies and the heterogeneous sequencing depth along the viral genomes present barriers to adoption of existing assembly programs. A recently published comparison showed that none of the tested haplotype reconstruction tools were able to successfully reconstruct the five known strains for a mock HIV quasispecies (Jayasundara et al., 2014) . We had the same observations when comparing several popular metagenomic assembly tools and haplotype assembly tools such as IDBA-UD (Peng et al., 2012) , IVA (Hunt et al., 2015) , SAVAGE (Baaijens et al., 2017) , MLEHaplo (Malhotra et al., 2015) on the same data set (Chen et al., 2018) . Many methods output a set of contigs with various sizes that are much shorter than the genomes. With these outputted contigs from assembly programs, it still remains to infer the number of haplotypes and to match the contigs to their originating haplotypes. Thus, there is a need to cluster the contigs into different groups so that each group represents a haplotype. This step is called contig scaffolding or binning and has been applied for bacterial strain characterization.",

Thus, composition-based features such as tetranucleotide frequencies or GC contents are not informative enough to separate contigs from different haplotypes, which usually share high sequence similarity (over 90%). Tools that heavily rely on sequence composition-based features will not be able to estimate the number of haplotypes correctly. Second, RNA virus sequencing tends to be compounded by gene expression and fast degradation and thus the observed sequencing coverage along each haplotype, or even a contig, can be more heterogeneous than expected. In addition, if a contig contains a region that is common to multiple haplotypes, that region tends to have higher coverage than a haplotype-specific segment. All these challenges require carefully designed methods to use the coverage information for contig binning.",

Most of the existing contig binning tools for microbiome sequencing data are designed for bacteria. These methods usually estimate the bin number by aligning metagenomic data to a pre-established marker gene database, and then assign assembled contigs to different bins using sequence composition information and read coverage levels.

There are mainly two steps: (1) estimate the number of haplotypes by aligning contigs and identifying windows; (2) calculate relative abundances in each window and apply a clustering algorithm to group clusters of the same haplotype. The underlying algorithm of grouping contigs into haplotypes is prototype-based clustering (Tan et al., 2005) . Features such as the overlaps and paired-end connections have limited usage in grouping distant contigs from the same haplotype. The clustering will mainly use the features based on the abundance distributions. Although abundance-based clustering has been used for contig binning from multiple samples (Wu et al., 2014; Quince et al., 2017) , existing tools are not designed to tackle key challenges of distinguishing contigs of different haplotypes. First, the observed coverage of each contig not only depends on the abundance of the underlying haplotype, but also depends on whether it is a unique or shared region by two or more haplotypes. Second, heterogeneous coverage of each haplotype in an RNA viral quasispecies is common, which is caused by sequencing-related biases and compounded by gene expression. Thus, directly applying existing prototype-based clustering . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Our solution to this problem is to cut the contigs into \"windows\" and to apply the clustering on sub-contigs that are more likely to represent one haplotype. In addition, instead of assuming any parametric distribution, which is usually not the case for haplotype contigs, we will use a non-parametric distribution.",

With stringent alignment threshold, contigs that can be aligned with each other usually come from the same region of the virus and thus the number of aligned contigs can be carefully used for haplotype number estimation. We progressively build multiple sequence alignments using contigs' pairwise alignments. In this step, base-level accuracy of the alignment is not a major concern and thus progressive construction of the alignment between contigs can serve the purpose well. We first sort the contigs by their lengths in descending order. The longest contig will be used as the first reference. All the other contigs will be aligned to the reference using blast+ (Camacho et al., 2009) to generate an alignment profile similar to multiple sequence alignment. Two types of alignments are kept from the output of blast+. One is the \"glocal\" alignment, which is local to the reference but global to the shorter contigs. The other is overlap alignment, which is the alignment between the suffix/prefix strings of the contigs. If not all the shorter contigs can be aligned to the reference contig, this process will continue by using the second longest contig as the reference until all the contigs are used. Fig. 2 .(c) shows the alignment between contigs using the longest contig as the reference, which is usually produced for the most abundant haplotype.",

Fig. 2. (b) shows the contigs satisfying the conditions in the ideal case. There are three haplotypes with different abundances. They only contain mutations at three positions that are far away from each other. Because of the long common regions among them, assembly programs usually won't be able to recover all the three genomes. Instead, they can generate short but correct contigs. In Fig. 2.

With the total coverage of 1000-x, three sets of reads are produced using different abundance distributions. The first one is based on the power law equation (Barbosa et al., 2012) . The second and the third sets of reads represent challenging cases where different haplotypes have similar abundances, which create difficulties for abundance-based binning algorithms. The abundance differences in the second and third data set are 0.06 and 0.03, respectively. In total, there are 38,914 simulated reads for 5 HIV haplotypes. The relative abundance for five haplotypes in each read set can be found in Table 1 . As the total coverage is 1000-x, the sequencing coverage of each haplotype is the product of the total coverage and the relative abundance. Contig simulation For each reference genome (denote its length as L), we randomly generated a list of location pairs (p 1 , p 2 ), where 1 \u2264 p 1 < p 2 \u2264 L. Each location pair represents a candidate contig's starting and ending position. Then, in the simulated contigs, we only keep the ones above 500 bp (i.e. p 2 \u2212 p 1 + 1 \u2265 500). In addition, we would like to simulate the hard case where the contigs cannot be extended any more using large overlaps. Thus, we sort all the remaining contigs by p 1 and remove the ones that have overlaps of size above 100 bp with previous contigs in the sorted list. The five sets of simulated contigs have different N50 values and are referred to as \"1000\" to \"5000\", indicating the upper bound of the contig length in each set. Table S1 in the Supplementary Data file shows the detailed properties of the five sets of contigs. All the simulated data sets can be downloaded from VirBin's Github repository.",

With increasing contig lengths, the clustering performance becomes better for all three different abundance distributions. When the contigs are long, the clustering performance for haplotypes with different abundance distributions is comparable. The results were compared with MaxBin, which is a binning tool for metagenomic contigs based on tetranucleotide frequencies and reads coverage levels. MaxBin requires marker genes to identify seed contigs for binning. We were able to run the core clustering program of MaxBin by inputting both the number of haplotypes (i.e. 5) and the seed contigs manually. We randomly chose one contig from each haplotype as the seed contig and calculated the contigs' abundances by mapping reads to them using Bowtie2. Although the haplotype number was explicitly provided to MaxBin, empty clusters can be produced by MaxBin. The results from MaxBin are shown in Fig. 5 .",

In addition, for contig sets from 1000 -4000, there are haplotypes without correctly assigned contigs. The lower sensitivity of MaxBin could be caused by its dependency on both sequence composition and contig coverage for clustering. Due to high sequence similarities between viral haplotypes, sequence composition is not informative enough in differentiating contigs from different viral strains. Instead, MaxBin could mistakenly cluster contigs from the homogeneous regions of the viral genome, leading to more chimeric clusters.",

These contigs have a N50 value of 2,223 bp and the longest contig is 9,133 bp. Haplotype number estimation VirBin was applied to the aligned contigs for haplotype number estimation. All the windows were sorted in descending order of window length. Out of the top 50 windows, 27 contain 5 contigs, 16 contain 6 contigs, and 2 contain 4 contigs. Out of the top 25 windows, 17 contain 5 contigs, 5 contain 6 contigs, and 1 contains 4 contigs. Similar to the simulated data, using the consensus window depth (i.e. 5) correctly predicted the haplotype number. Clustering results The clustering algorithm was applied to cluster the contigs into 5 groups. For each contig, its originating haplotype is determined by comparing the contig with all reference genomes. The haplotype with the highest similarity and above 98% is assigned. The outputs of VirBin and MaxBin are shown in Table 2 . StrainPhlAn and ConStrains were applied on this real HIV data set. StrainPhlAn was able to identify the HIV species, but could not report any strain information. ConStrains could not align enough reads to marker genes for further strain-level analysis. Compared to the simulated contigs or assembled contigs using simulated reads, the results of VirBin on the real sequencing data have generally lower sensitivity and precision. There are two major reasons. First, the assembled contigs for real reads are more likely to contain errors. Second, this data set has several haplotypes with very similar average abundances. Referring to Fig. 8 , the abundance difference between the 2 least abundant haplotypes is < 2%. Thus, the clustering algorithm could mix contigs from these haplotypes.",

While VirBin focuses on sub-contigs that are more likely unique to one haplotype, MaxBin clusters whole contigs, which could contain regions common to multiple haplotypes and makes read coverage more heterogeneous. In addition, sequence composition-based features such as tetranucleotide frequencies are not effective in distinguishing highly similar viral strains.",

When the genome coverage by the contigs is below 70%, the performance of VirBin deteriorates because it becomes harder to estimate the correct number of haplotypes. In addition, the empirical experience shows that it is difficult to classify two viral strains when the abundance difference between them is below 3%. Thus, although we have demonstrated much better contig binning performance for distinguishing viral haplotypes than other contig binning tools, genome-scale viral haplotype construction is still a challenging problem.",
