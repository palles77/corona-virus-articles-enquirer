The variance in viral load increased with temperature, whilst 27 the mean viral load did not, such that as temperature increased the most 28 susceptible species become more susceptible, and the least susceptible less so. We 29 found no significant relationship between a species' susceptibility across 30 temperatures and proxies for thermal optima; critical thermal maximum and 31 minimum or basal metabolic rate. These results suggest that whilst the rank order 32 of species susceptibilities can remain the same with changes in temperature, the 33 likelihood of host shifts into a given species may increase or decrease.

Understanding the factors underlying 38 host shifts is a major goal for infectious disease researchers. This effort has been 39 further complicated by the fact that host-parasite interactions are now taking place 40 in a period of unprecedented global climatic warming. Here, we ask how host shifts 41 are affected by temperature by carrying out experimental infections using an RNA 42 virus across a wide range of related species, at three different temperatures. We 43 find that as temperature increases the most susceptible species become more 44 susceptible, and the least susceptible less so. This has important consequences for 45 our understanding of host shift events in a changing climate, and suggests that 46 temperature changes may affect the likelihood of a host shift into certain species. 47 Introduction 49 Temperature is arguably the most important abiotic factor that affects all 50 organisms, having both indirect and direct effects on physiology and life history 51 traits [1-3]. There is much to be learned about the impact of climate change on 52 infectious diseases [1,4,5]. Changes in temperature can impact both host and 53 parasite biology, leading to complex and difficult to predict outcomes [2,6]. 54 55 Host shifts, where a parasite from one host species invades and establishes in a 56 novel host species, are an important source of emerging infectious disease [7]. 57 Some of the most deadly outbreaks of infectious diseases in humans including 58",

Ancestral states were estimated using a phylogenetic 388 mixed model that partitioned the inter-specific variance into that explained by the host phylogeny 389 under a Brownian model of evolution (vp), and a species-specific variance component that is not390 explained by the phylogeny (vs). 391 392 The changes we observe could be explained by the increase in temperature 393 effectively increasing the rate at which successful infection is progressing (i.e. 394 altering where in the course of infection we have sampled). However, this seems 395 unlikely as at 2 days post infection at the medium temperature (22\u00b0C), viral load 396 peaks and then plateaus [35]. Therefore, in those species where viral load increases 397 first increase and then decrease, which we do not observe in a time course 401 at 22\u00b0C [35]. To check whether this also holds at higher temperatures we carried 402 out a time course of infection in a subset of six of the experimental species at 27\u00b0C, 403 where we would expect the fastest transition between the rapid viral growth and 404 the plateau phase of infection to occur (S1 Fig), This allowed us to confirm that the 405 decreasing viral loads observed in some species at higher temperatures are not due 406 to general trend for viral loads to decline over longer periods of (metabolic) time. 407 408 We quantified the lower and upper thermal tolerances (CTmin and CTmax) across all 409 45 species with 3 replicates per species. Neither CTmax nor CTmin were found to be 410 significant predictors of viral load (CTmin -0.21, 95% CI: -0.79, 0.93, pMCMC = 0.95 411 and CTmax 0.31, 95% CI: -0.11, 0.74, pMCMC = 0.152).

Consequently 428 the species/temperature mean BMRs used in the analysis of viral load will be 429 poorly estimated and so the effects of BMR will be underestimated with too narrow 430 credible intervals. To rectify this we ran a series of measurement error models, the 431 most conservative of which gave a slope of -9.8 but with very wide credible intervals 432 (-62.5, 42.6). Full details of these models are given in the Supplementary Materials. 433 434 Discussion 435 We found that susceptibilities of different species responded in different ways to 436 changes in temperature.

The potential for novel host shifts may increase 61 with changing temperatures due to fluctuations in host and/or parasite fitness, or 62 changes in species distributions and abundances [14,15]. Distribution changes 63 may lead to new species assemblages, causing novel contacts between parasites 64 and potential hosts [16-18]. 65 Susceptibility to infection is known to vary with temperature due to within 67 individual physiological changes in factors such as the host immune response, 68 metabolic rate or behavioural adaptations [19-22]. Thermally stressed hosts may 69 face a trade-off between the resource investment needed to launch an immune 70 response versus that needed for thermoregulation, or behavioural adaptations to 71 withstand sub-optimal temperatures [23-26]. Temperature shifts could also cause 72 method, whereby a fly was scored as completely paralysed if on gentle tapping of 198 the vial wall the fly did not move any of its body parts. 199 To examine how cellular function changes with temperature, we estimated the 202 resting metabolic rate of each species at 17\u00b0C, 22\u00b0C and 27 \u00b0C.

Every 2 days flies were tipped onto fresh vials of 207 cornmeal food. This was repeated in three blocks in order to get three repeat 208 measures of metabolic rate for each of the species, at each of the three 209 experimental temperatures.

Previous studies that found phylogenetic signal in host 463 susceptibility were carried out at a single experimental temperature [34, 35] . 464 Therefore, the patterns observed could potentially be explained by some host 465 clades being assayed at sub-optimal thermal conditions. We used CTmax and CTmin 466 as proxies for thermal optima, which due to its multifaceted nature is problematic 467 to measure directly [77-79]. We also measured basal metabolic rate across three 468 temperatures to see if the changes in viral load could be explained by general 469 increases in enzymatic processes. We found that these measures were not 470 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/358564 doi: bioRxiv preprint",
