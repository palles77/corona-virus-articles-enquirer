This coronavirus belongs to the \u03b2 genus, which was named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (6, 7) . Most of the initial cases had a history of exposure to the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan city, and some cases rendered a family clustering feature. The source of infection is still unknown, however it is speculated that the infection may have been caused by bats or vipers (8) . The infection is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets. The median time from onset to admission to the hospital was 9 days, and most patients were between 40 and 60 years-old. The clinical manifestations are mainly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, with gradual dyspnea in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases (2, 3, 9) . In this case, the patient had no clear history of contact with the epidemic area, and both the leukocytes and lymphocytes were normal, thus it was misdiagnosed as common pneumonia at first.",

The imaging findings of COVID-19 overlap with other viral pneumonia, therefore, nucleic acid tests are recommended for prompt diagnosis and treatment.",

Initial posteroanterior chest radiograph and chest CT scan were performed on day of admission (3 days after onset of fever). Chest radiograph (A) shows no thoracic abnormalities. Axial CT scan (B) shows GGOs in subpleural area of right lower lobe. Left lung is normal. C-E. Follow-up chest CT scans taken 6 days after onset of fever show increased density of GGOs in right lower lobe, which then progressed into consolidations with perilobular thickening. Multifocal peripheral patchy areas of nodular consolidations and nodular GGO lesions are newly developed in subpleural areas of both lower lobes. F. Progressive resolution of parenchymal lesions is seen in follow-up high-resolution CT scan obtained on day 12. Patchy consolidations and GGOs in both lungs were almost absorbed leaving a few fibrous lesions that may represent residual organizing pneumonia. Repeat real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was negative and patient was discharged. CT = computer tomography, GGO = ground-glass opacity //doi.org/10.3348/kjr.2020.0112",
