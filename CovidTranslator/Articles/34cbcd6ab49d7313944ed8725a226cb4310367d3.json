While bats may be the primary reservoir for both viruses, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) likely crossed into humans from civets in China, and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been transmitted from camels in the Middle East. Unlike SARS-CoV that resolved within a year, continued introductions of MERS-CoV present an on-going public health threat. Animal models are needed to evaluate countermeasures against emerging viruses. With SARS-CoV, several animal species were permissive to infection. In contrast, most laboratory animals are refractory or only semipermissive to infection with MERS-CoV. This host-range restriction is largely determined by sequence heterogeneity in the MERS-CoV receptor. We describe animal models developed to study coronaviruses, with a focus on host-range restriction at the level of the viral receptor and discuss approaches to consider in developing a model to evaluate countermeasures against MERS-CoV.",

Specifically, two novel coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) caused significant concern because they crossed the species barrier and caused severe disease. While SARS-CoV originated in Asia and spread rapidly to several countries throughout the world, MERS-CoV has largely been restricted to infections acquired in the Middle East. Both viruses are associated with spread from person to person and a high case-fatality rate, thus the development of animal models for evaluation of antiviral therapies and vaccines has been a high priority.",

This was strengthened by studies that identified MERS-CoV RNA in nasal swabs from 3 camels on a farm associated with 2 human cases (31), and additional studies in which a camel isolate was directly linked to a fatal human case in Saudi Arabia (32, 33). Furthermore, experimental infection of dromedary camels demonstrated that they could be productively infected and shed high titers of virus in their nasal secretions (34). However, the relative role of camels and bats as reservoirs for MERS-CoV remains to be determined.",

Following serial adaptation of SARS-CoV in mice (41) and the engineering of transgenic mice to express human ACE2 (42, 43) , this obstacle was partially overcome. The development of these murine models enabled efficacy studies of anti-viral agents and several vaccines against SARS-CoV (44, 45) . In contrast, several animal species have been evaluated for MERS-CoV but with the exception of some primate species, most animals are resistant to infection. Herein, we describe the animal models for both SARS and MERS-CoV with a focus on the role of the host receptor. We conclude by discussing other approaches that could be used to develop animal models of MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "Animal models of infectious diseases serve two key purposes: 1) to characterize viral pathogenesis, and 2) to evaluate anti-viral agents and vaccines. In the context of infectious diseases for which it is not feasible or ethical to perform clinical trials, animal studies play an additional role. Under the FDA's Animal Efficacy Rule (\"Animal Rule\") therapeutics against rare, emerging, or virulent agents can achieve regulatory approval provided efficacy is demonstrated in two animal models (one of which must be a non-rodent species) that display clinical illness representative of human disease (46). The ideal animal model is permissive to infection and reproduces the clinical course and pathology observed in humans. An algorithm for the development of animal models is presented in Figure 1 . Small animal models offer several advantages over NHP's including availability of animals and species specific reagents, ease of handling, reduced cost, and the ability to use sufficient numbers for statistical analysis. Especially with coronaviruses, rodents vary in susceptibility and may be semi-permissive to infection and refractory to clinical disease (47) , even so, they can be used to screen countermeasures (48) (49) (50) (51) . Thus, to generate a rodent model that displays clinical disease it may be necessary to adapt the virus to enhance virulence for the rodent host or generate transgenic animals. Pathogenesis in these models should be fully characterized because the disease mechanism of an adapted virus or in a transgenic animal may be different from that in the natural host ( Figure 1 ).",

Since studies in NHP incur significant expense, most investigators choose to screen therapies in small animal models and then perform more limited primate studies. It is important to note that there are several species and subspecies of NHP that can result in significant variation in the Sutton level of viral replication and clinical disease. Thus, several species must often be evaluated to yield a suitable animal model. Collectively, the development of animal models in both rodents and NHP has been fundamental to the study of infectious diseases and has lead to the development of countermeasures against several zoonotic pathogens.",

Mice did not lose weight, display signs of clinical disease or develop pulmonary pathology. Studies in C57BL/6 (B6) mice yielded similar results, with a lack of clinical disease and clearance of virus by day 9. Knockout mice on the B6 background including beige and CD1 \u2212/\u2212 strains that lack NK cell function and NK-T cells, respectively, and RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice that lack T and B lymphocytes also did not develop clinical disease. Viral kinetics were similar in B6, beige, CD1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, and RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (52) . Similarly, 129SvEv mice displayed peak viral replication on day 3 with clearance by day 8 and did not develop clinical illness. Histopathological examination showed evidence of self-limiting bronchiolitis and patchy interstitial pneumonia. In contrast, disease progression was significantly altered in STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 mice on the 129SvEv background. STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 mice displayed progressive weight loss and bronchiolitis that progressed to interstitial pneumonia and mediastinitis (53) .

In contrast, aged 129SvEv mice did not support prolonged pulmonary viral replication and cleared the virus by day 5 (40).

On day 5 post-infection, aged BALB/c mice displayed prominent perivascular infiltrates and alveolar damage that persisted until day 9 (58) .

In general, disease severity in transgenic mice correlated with the level of hACE2 expression. Transgenic mice expressing hACE2 under the control of a cytokeratine promoter had high levels of ACE2 mRNA in the lung, liver, colon, and kidney (42, 59). When these mice were challenged with SARS-CoV, they developed a severe infection beginning in the airway epithelium that spread to the brain. Infection resulted in weight loss beginning between days 3 to 5, and 100% mortality by day 7 (42, 59) . Using an alternate approach in which hACE2 was expressed under the control of a chicken beta-actin promoter with an cytomegalovirus IE enhancer, transgenic mouse lines with differing levels of hACE2 were generated (60) . Infection of mice with high levels of hACE2 expression similarly yielded a severe lung and brain infection with 100% mortality. In contrast, infection of mice expressing lower levels of hACE2 resulted in clinical illness without associated mortality (60) . This finding was further supported by a third model in which hACE2 was expressed under the control of the mouse ACE2 promoter resulting in limited tissue distribution of hACE2. When these mice were challenged with SARS-CoV, they became lethargic but survived infection (43) . These mice also showed severe interstitial pneumonia with extrapulmonary organ damage suggesting that they more accurately modeled human SARS-CoV infection. However, in all of these studies, an increase in viral load or viral antigen was observed in the brain tissue of transgenic mice, and mortality resulted from extensive dissemination of the virus in the brain (42). This finding is in contrast to human disease in which central nervous system infection was only rarely observed. Thus, while transgenic mice resulted in a lethal model of SARS-CoV infection, no mouse model accurately reproduced the disease spectrum observed in SARS-CoV infected patients.",

Infection of hamsters with SARS-CoV (10 3 or 10 5 TCID 50 of the Urbani strain) results in a productive infection with peak replication on day 2-3 in the nasal turbinates and lungs, and viral clearance by day 7. Infection also results in extrapulmonary spread consisting of transient viremia and spread to the liver and spleen in a proportion (1/3 or 2/3) of animals. Viral replication is accompanied by pulmonary histopathology consisting of focal areas of interstitial inflammation and consolidation that are visible on day 3, and become more widespread until day 7 when consolidation involves 30-40% of the lung (62) . Despite the extensive pulmonary pathology, hamsters do not display overt clinical disease or mortality. Weight loss is difficult to assess in hamsters due to the storage of food in large cheek pouches; however, the use of a running wheel with a rotation counter permitted objective measurement of nocturnal activity of these animals. Compared to mock-infected hamsters and pre-infection activity levels, SARS-CoV infected hamsters exhibited a greater than 90% reduction in activity (40, 61). This was the first objective measurement of clinical illness in hamsters.",

Infection of ferrets with virus doses from 10 3 to 10 7 TCID 50 yielded a productive infection in lungs, trachea and nasal turbinates. Viral replication peaked in the lungs on day 5 or 6, and reached levels of 10 6 TCID 50 /mL of lung homogenate (65) (66) (67) (68) . The primary histopathological finding was of multifocal pulmonary lesions affecting 5-10% of the lung with mild alveolar damage, and peribronchiolar and perivascular lymphocyte infiltration (66, 67, 69) . Reports on clinical disease vary. In initial studies utilizing intratracheal administration, 3 of 6 infected ferrets became lethargic and one animal succumbed to disease, and in a study utilizing the Toronto-2 (Tor2) SARS-CoV isolate, lethargy and prolonged disease was also observed (66, 70) . In subsequent reports using either intratracheal or intranasal administration lethargy or mortality were not observed (65, 67, 68, 71) . Furthermore, in a study specifically designed to assess the ferret as a non-rodent model to meet the criteria for the FDA \"Animal Rule\", clinical disease was limited to fever and sneezing in large groups of ferrets inoculated with the Toronto-2 strain (65) . In a single study, contact transmission of SARS-CoV to uninfected cage mates was reported along with conjunctivitis and mortality on days 16 and 21 (66) . Histopathological analysis found evidence of hepatic lipidosis and emaciation indicating mortality was not associated with SARS-CoV pneumonia. These findings indicate that SARS-CoV could transmit at low levels by direct contact in the ferret model. In summary ferrets were shown to support SARS-CoV replication with varying degrees of clinical disease, and much like the rodent models, SARS-CoV infection did not result in significant mortality.",

All three species produced neutralizing antibodies and antibody titers correlated with virus replication. Pulmonary pathology was examined in African Green monkeys on day 2 and 4 post-infection. Consistent with the features of interstitial pneumonia, on day 2 there were focal interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and edema in the lung.

As civet (c) ACE2 displayed affinity for both human (Tor2 and GD03) and civet SARS-CoV isolates (Sz02 and Gd05), while human (h) ACE2 preferentially bound the S protein RBD of human isolates, biochemical studies were performed to define mutations influencing RBD affinity (82) (83) (84) (85) .

The two regions were designated hotspot 31 and hotspot 353. In hotspot 31, residues K31 and E35 of hACE2 interact to form a salt bridge, and E35 in turn interacts with N479 of the S protein RBD.

In Table 1 , we have compared the ACE2 amino acids that interact with the S protein RBD from several species. Examining the human, AGM, and macaque ACE2 residues, all 4 species have identical RBD-ACE2 interaction residues. The marmoset and hamster ACE2 residues are very similar to those of hACE2 and this is in agreement with the permissive nature of these species. In contrast, many of the residues of mouse ACE2 are different from those of human ACE2 (81) and this corresponds with reduced replication of SARS-CoV in mouse cells (86) and the lungs of young mice (47) . While mice are semipermissive to SARS-CoV, rats do not support replication of SARS-CoV. Two changes relative to human ACE2, at positions 353 and 82 of mouse and rat ACE2 are predicted to account for this difference in replication (81) . Both mice and rats have a histidine at position 353 compared to 353K in hACE2. This partially disrupts the S protein-DPP4 interaction (81) ; moreover, the asparagine (N) 82 of rat ACE2 introduces a glycosylation site that blocks the interaction at position 82 with residue L472 of the S protein RBD. In contrast, mouse ACE2 has a serine (S) at position 82, that though sub-optimal, does not prevent the interaction with the S protein. Together the combined changes in mACE2 at position 353 and 82 lead to inefficient binding of the S protein and reduced permissiveness of mouse cells, while the glycosylation site at residue 82 in rat ACE2 abrogates binding (81) .",

Severe disease was the result of an overwhelming viral infection with significantly higher titers and prolonged replication in the lungs accompanied by extensive damage to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells (41). MA15 was also capable of extrapulmonary spread as evident by viremia, and recovery of virus from spleen, liver, and brain tissues.

Furthermore, reversion of the S protein mutation resulted in a nonlethal infection with no clinical disease.

In human SARS-CoV strains, residue Y436 of the S protein interacts with hACE2 at residues D38 and Q42. This interaction is within hotspot 31 and binding is further influenced by residue 353K of hACE2. In mACE2 the K353H mutation interferes with the interaction between Y436 of the S protein RBD and D38 of mACE2. Thus, in MA15, the mutation Y436H that arose with serial passage overcomes this interference (88) promoting enhanced binding. In the MA20 strain, two mutations evolved in the RBD: Y442L and N479K. These mutations are predicted to form polar interactions with N30 and N31 of mACE2, and the change of Y442L removes a bulky side chain permitting access and enhancing binding of K479 to N30 and N31 (88) . The v2163 strain contains mutations, Y436H and Y442F. As described above the Y436H mutation most likely compensates for mACE2 353H. The extent of steric clash between N31 of mACE2 and Y442 has not been described; however, the Y442F change removes a hydroxyl group from the binding interface and this is predicted to enhance the interaction with mACE2 (88).",

These strains represent an advance in the development of an animal model for the \"Animal Rule\" though the disease mechanism in young mice is different from that in humans. The use of the MA15 virus in aged mice has proved to be a valuable model for the study of SARS-CoV vaccine candidates. Studies examining mutations that arose upon serial passage and detailed analysis of S protein ACE2 interactions emphasize the role of the S protein in host restriction and demonstrate that the S protein-host receptor interactions are critical for the development of animal models. This is further emphasized by the finding that transgenic mice expressing hACE2 and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains both show enhanced replication and disease. As our understanding of host-receptor interactions develops, application of this knowledge will facilitate the development animal models for emerging coronaviruses.",

In MERS-CoV inoculated animals, Mx expression was similar to that of mock-infected infected animals. To verify that the host receptor of MERS-CoV was expressed in hamsters, immunohistochemistry for DPP4 was performed. DPP4 was expressed at high levels in bronchiolar epithelium and smooth muscle in the lung, and also in the glomerular parietal epithelium and nerve tissue in the kidney (93) .

Patch 1 consists of hDPP4 residues K267 and R336 interacting with a negatively charged surface consisting of E536, D537, and D539 of the S protein RBD. In addition, Y499 of the S protein RBD forms a hydrogen bond with R336 of DPP4 (100, 101). The second major binding patch consists of DPP4 residues L294, I295, H298, R317, and Q344.

To further understand the role of the S protein RBD in host restriction, subsequent studies compared the MERS-CoV S protein binding affinity of human and mouse DPP4, and that of several potential zoonotic reservoir species including camels, horses, goats, and bats (102) . Introduction of the human DPP4 S protein binding domain into mouse DPP4 rendered mouse cells susceptible to Sutton (102) . Further characterization of amino acid residues at the interface of DPP4 with the S protein RBD identified 6 differences between mouse and human DPP4 (See Table 2 (104) . Introduction of the human DPP4 residues at all 5 sites in mouse DPP4 resulted in highly efficient infection. Selective mutation of only residues 336 and 346 associated with the patch 1 binding region, or residues 288, 294, 295 in the patch 2 domain did not restore highly efficient infection, indicating that interactions with both patch regions were required for high affinity DPP4-S protein binding.

Indeed comparison of human, rhesus macaque and common marmoset DPP4 sequences show 100% identity at the residues that interact with MERS-CoV S protein. However, the differences in disease severity between rhesus macaques and common marmosets indicate that other host factors such as the presence or expression levels of S-cleaving proteases (i.e. TMPRSS2) (104) may influence infection and disease severity. Regardless of additional host factors, the interaction of DPP4 with MERS-CoV S protein should be the initial and predominant focus of small animal model development.",

Mouse adaptation, or adaptation to ferrets or hamsters, are unlikely to be fruitful approaches because infectious virus could not be isolated from these Sutton animals and the MERS-CoV S protein failed to bind DPP4 from these species. To overcome this barrier, reverse genetics approaches could be used to introduce mutations into the MERS-CoV S protein RBD to enhance or promote interaction with DPP4 of different species.

With either transgenic strategy or with the development of a reverse genetics adapted strain, replication and pathogenesis will have to be characterized to meet the criteria for the FDA Animal Rule.Despite the lack of suitable models, several groups are developing vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV(107)(108)(109)(110)(111)(112)(113)(114). Vaccine candidates are being evaluated for immunogenicity and antivirals are being evaluated in vitro. Medical countermeasures have the potential to advance along the path towards regulatory approval if a susceptible small animal model can be developed and used in conjunction with the marmoset model. In concert with public health efforts, novel therapies could curb the on-going MERS-CoV epidemic and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with MERS-CoV.26.
