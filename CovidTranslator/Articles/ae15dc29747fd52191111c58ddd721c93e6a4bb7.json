However, in suspensions of fecal materials, numerous particles do not always exhibit the typical coronavirus morphology and consequently are often refered to as viruslike or coronavirus-like particles (5, 7) . This is particularly the case when rabbit fecal material is evaluated for the presence of corona~-iruses. Particles have been observed in fecal material collected from young rabbits with clinical signs of enteritis (6, 11, 12) . However, very tittle is known about these particles. They share some morphological characteristics with other members of the family Coronaviridae but most often do not show typical surface projections. Those structures are either shorter than the reported length or not clearly defined and appear as a fuzzy coat. Furthermore, according to our experience, coronavirus particles are often present in low titer in rabbit feces. Proper identification is then difficult to achieve and it has become necessary to develop a more sensitive assay. For that purpose, we characterized the structural polypeptides of the viral particles in rabbit feces and we adapted an immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) technique to evaluate the presence of rabbit enteric coronavirns (RECV) in rabbit feces.",

Since both these sera recognized the 34,000 matrix protein, the 54,000 nuc]eoprotein and the 100,000, 82,000 and 71,000 molecular weight envelope protein. Both the t00,000 and 82,000 are recognised peplomer proteins (4, 16) and a protein between 60,000 to 70,000 has been described for mouse hepatitis, bovine coronavirus and porcine haemegglutinating encephalitis virus. Our results are in good agreement with the typical coronavirus profile. The 76,000 molecular weight protein reeognised by the chicken anti-IBV is somewhat of a puzzle: it could be a higher molecular weight protein that has been partially degraded, since EM observation confirms that the spike protein is broken, but it is difficult to understand why the porcine anti-TGE does not recognize it. However, the data obtained support the h)xpothesis that this is indeed a coronavirus, and that there are cross reactions with two other coronaviruses. It is to be noted that by blotting we are identifying antibodies that recognise mostly primary and secondary structure epitopes which are likely to be more conserved that tertiary and quaternary epitopes. Those at the surface of the viral particle could be recognized by blocking biological activity such as infectivity or by IEM. This specific virus has not yet been cultured in vitro. However, its presence can still be easily detected by IEM assay. The results of this study indicate that this procedure is a useful method for the detection of I~ECV. The observation of immune aggregates not found in controls, the diameter of the particles observed and the presence of short peplomers indicate that these particles are coronaviruses. The electro-phoresis s t u d y performed in the viral particles used for the immunization procedure confirm their identification. When these particles are observed by EM alone, t h e y are found in limited n u m b e r and are often difficult to identify. The use of specific antiserum contributes then to facilitate the diagnosis of R E C V b y eliminating the ambiguities on the identification of this specific virus and b y reducing the observation time requested for its identification. The coronavirus particles are readily found in aggregates surrounded b y antibodies and the observer does not have to rely only on a specific morphology for identification. Furthermore, the results of statistical analysis confirm, as expected, the superiority of IEM over EM. The I E M assay is used in the diagnostic field to evaluate the presence of virus in specimens from various sources (9, 15) . In our laboratory it is used for the detection of h u m a n viruses in fecal material submitted for diagnosis purposes (2) . I t allows the identification of specific viruses and also the detection of viral particles present in limited numbers. The results of the present s t u d y indicate t h a t this assay is also a valuable procedure for detection of R E C V in rabbit feces.",
