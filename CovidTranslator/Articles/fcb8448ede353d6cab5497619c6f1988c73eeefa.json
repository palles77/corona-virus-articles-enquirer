Some of these agents were related to a sometimes fatal disease, others were associated with adenoviruses, but most were at the time of discovery not etiologically related to a definite disease. Initial interest arose mainly with the discovery that these virions encapsidate a singlestranded DNA. This finding raised the question of how single-stranded DNA viruses are replicated in eukaryotic cells. More recently, however, parvoviruses have been associated with economically and hygienically important diseases.",

Also, the nucleic acid in the complete virions readily reacted with formaldehyde (resulting in about 20% hyperchromicity), indicating a single-stranded structure (Crawford, 1966) . These findings were confirmed by physicochemical studies on the extracted nucleic acid (Table II) , with the following results: (1) the buoyant density of the DNA was not affected by alkali denaturation and neutralization; (2) no definite melting point of the isolated nucleic acids could be found during thermal denaturation (under neutral conditions).",

These terminal repetitions are about 150 nucleotides long. The DNAs of the autonomous parvoviruses, however, do not have an inverted terminal repetition (Bourguignon et al., 1976) . Moreover, the 3' and 5' ends of the AAV genomes are complementary, whereas the two ends of the autonomous genomes differ in size and sequence and are not complementary (Astell et al., 1979) . Astell et al. (1979) characterized the 3' termini of the DNA from four autono mous rodent parvoviruses (KRV, MVM, . They demonstrated that these termini exist as Y-shaped hairpin structures involving 115 or 116 nucleo tides. The DNA sequence of this region is highly conserved among these four rodent parvoviruses, although there are some minor differences. Since these DNAs are readily distinguished on the basis of restriction enzyme maps, these 3' terminal homologies suggest either a pressure to conserve the sequence of the terminal hairpin structure or a close evolutionary relationship among these viruses.",

No other enzymatic activities have as yet been reported for the parvoviral proteins. It seems, however, that they play an essential role in the replication and maturation of the virus (see Section VI). The parvovirus genomes, in general, do not contain the coding capacity for the combined molecular weights of their structural proteins. This might be explained by the presence of overlapping genes in the viral DNA or by an incorporation of host proteins. Similarities among the structural proteins have been shown by peptide mapping for MVM (Tattersall et al., 1977) and DNV (Tijssen and Kurstak, 1979b) . These experiments revealed that for a given parvovirus all structural proteins have common sequences. Pulse-chase experiments seem to indicate that the AAV proteins also have an important overlap of the primary structure Buller and Rose, 1978; Salo and Mayor, 1978) . However, these authors disagree on whether a precursor protein exists or whether mecha nisms other than posttranslational proteolytic processing are involved (e.g., AAV polypeptides generated at the level of protein synthesis).",

These specific differences divide the parvoviruses into two groups: (1) the Parvovirus and (2) the Adenosatellovirus and Densovirus. All the members of the Parvovirus group seem initially to contain two structural proteins (Table III) . The major protein may be cleaved during a maturation process so that a third protein with a slightly lower molecular weight appears and the formerly noninfectious particle becomes infectious (Tattersall et al., , 1977 . The buoyant density of the MVM virions also decreases during this cleavage (or maturation) process . (Clin ton and Hayashi, 1975) , which probably is general for the Parvovirus genus. The members of the other genera in the Parvoviridae also have particles (with complete DNA) of two different densities. The differences between these two particles reside in the relative quantity of the two intermediate-weight proteins (Table IV) and a different quaternary structure . However, virions of both densities are infectious, in contrast to the Parvovirus genus, as described above.",

The first factor to be considered is the well-known fact that the stain used and the method of application may affect the apparent size. Hoggan (1971) showed that when 1% uranyl acetate is used on RV, H-l, HADEN (= BPV-1), DNV, MVM, or the AAV serotypes, they appear 12 to 15% larger than when replicate preparations are stained with 2% PTA. There may also be varying degrees of flattening of the particles on the grid. Moreover, the virus particles are not truly spherical, making it difficult to determine a definitive size for them. In the measurement of an icosahedron, the diameter varies in accordance with the direction of viewing, as Karasaki (1966) has noted. In an icosahedral model, the relative lengths of the maximum and minimum diameters are 1.00 and 0.85, respectively. Therefore, Karasaki (1966) preferred the measurement of a diame ter drawn from side to side, rather than vertex to vertex of the profiles of 4 'complete\" particles viewed along a three-or fivefold axis, since the side-to-side distances in both symmetry profiles are the same: the relative lengths are 0.85. Magnification errors of the microscopes might add some supplementary differ ences. In fact, diameters of various parvoviruses are rather similar if measured in the same study.",

Studies in our laboratory suggest that five molecules of the major protein cluster into a ring-like structure: the capsomer. Twelve capsomers are assembled into a complete particle. Therefore, the particle is a dodecahedron rather than an icosahedron (Fig. 3) . The proteins intermediate in quantity and molecular weight seem to attach to the center of the ring-like capsomers, giving Morphology of densonucleosis virus. The dodecahedron seems best to fit the structure of DNV (-\u25ba). In dodecahedral structures the number of vertices is 20 instead of 12 and the number of faces 12 instead of 20 when compared to an icosahedron. The ring-like molecules fit the size and structure of regular pentagons of such dodecahedrons and probably represent the capsomers (pentamers) . Bar represents 50 nm. the latter a \"full\" aspect. These various structures can be seen by electron microscopy since the buoyant density (1.31 gm/ml) of the hydrated protein and the molecular weights are known; the size of the ring-like capsomer (a pentamer) can easily be calculated, assuming a globular structure for each protein. The minimum diameter of the major structural protein of the parvoviruses is then about 5 nm and that of the capsomer about 10 nm. Such capsomer-like struc tures, compatible in size with these calculations, have been observed in a number of studies (Table V) .",

Clinton and Hayashi (1975) demonstrated that immature MVM bands at a higher density than the mature virus. This also gives two different particles, but this phenome non is quite different from the situation described above, in which the mature particles shed about 10 protein molecules and hence become denser and (as we will see later) have a lower sedimentation coefficient. Clinton and Hayashi (1975) also noted that after maturation and its concurrent lowering of the density, the virions may undergo another structural change so that they band again at a higher density (by shedding some of the proteins?).",

Particular parvo viruses can be distinguished, especially on a preliminary basis, by their specific hemagglutination pattern under standardized conditions (Table VII) . Human, guinea pig, rat, and pig erythrocytes are the primary species of interest for the parvovirologist. In contrast, bovine red blood cells have not yet been shown to be agglutinated by any parvovirus, whereas those from rabbits gave only a weak reaction with H-3 and X14. Erythrocytes of other species of mammalian and avian origin are, however, often needed to distinguish the various parvoviruses. Only a few parvoviruses (KBSH/PPV, H-l, RTV, and some latent parvoviruses isolated from established cell lines) agglutinate avian erythrocytes, whereas oth ers (e.g., MVM, MVC, FPV) have a rather limited agglutination range. FPV/MEV agglutinates only pig erythrocytes, whereas MVC was shown to agglutinate only rhesus or African green monkey erythrocytes. In this respect, the hemagglu tination pattern of the recently discovered canine enteritis virus is of interest. This virus shows many similarities with the FPV/MEV group. The hemaggluti nation results (Table VII) could, in fact, indicate a relationship with either FPV or MVC.",

On the whole, the chemical properties of the parvo virus agglutinins appear to be different from those of other hemagglutinating viruses; nevertheless, there are some similarities with the agglutinins of entero-and adenoviruses, such as the sensitivity to p-chloromercuribenzoate (Castro et al., 1971) . Proteins isolated from AAV-4, X14, and BPV, after dissociation of the virions by SDS, lost their hemagglutinating activity (Johnson and Hoggan, 1973; Salo and Mayor, 1977) . Small particles (\u00b1 10 nm in diameter) which can be isolated from X14 preparations have a hemagglutinating activity but are not infectious (Breese et al., 1964) . Though such small particles have been found associated with other parvoviruses (Section IV, C) and most probably represent capsomers (Tijssen and Kurstak, 1979a) , information on whether they have the same hemagglutinating abilities as the complete virions is still lacking. On the other hand, this does not mean that at least subassembled particles are needed for hemagglutination, since the treatment of the virus by SDS not only dissociates but also denatures the proteins. This denaturation alone could prevent hemagglu tination.",

Often nonspecific inhibi tions are present in normal sera or in antisera (Hallauer et al., 1972) . These inhibitors may be removed with kaolin by the method of Clarke and Casals (1958) . Illustrative of such an interference is the strong inhibitor isolated from human placentas for H-1 agglutinin, whereas, interestingly, RV and H-3 aggluti nins are not inhibited at all (Toolan, 1964; Usategui-Gomez and Morgan, 1968 ). Nevertheless, if homologous and heterologous antisera are available, HI by antisera is a convenient method to establish antigenic relationships. A reciprocal antigenic relationship was observed between H-1 and HT, between PPV and KBSH, and among RV, H-3, and X14; hemagglutination by other viruses tested (RTV, HB, MVM, FPV/MEV, BPV, MVC, Lu III, and TVX) was not or was to a very small extent inhibited by heterologous antisera . Joo et al. (1976b) investigated several variables for PPV HI tests. They adsorbed the antisera first with 25% in borate saline at pH 9. Natural hemagglutinins in test sera could be completely removed using 0.1 ml of packed erythrocytes to 0.6 ml of kaolin-treated sera. The highest virus-specific HI titers were obtained using guinea pig blood cells after an incubation of the virus with the serum for 18 hours at 4\u00b0C, 3 hours at 25\u00b0C, or 2 hours at 37\u00b0C.",

He demonstrated simultaneous hemagglutination abilities toward guinea pig, human, and rat erythrocytes during the course of RV reproduction in rat embryo tissue culture and showed that this agglutination ability is preceded by phenomena of hemadsorption when the washed sheets are exposed to erythrocyte suspensions. Portella (1964) observed that the supernatant fluids of H-l-and H-3-infected rat embryo tissue cultures hemagglutinate three types of erythrocytes, with the guinea pig cells consistently aggluti nating first. A few days later, H-l virus agglutinates human erythrocytes and H-3 hemagglutinates those of rats. Later, cells infected with either H-l or H-3 agglu tinate all three types of erythrocytes. Portella (1964) also showed by electron microscopy that the cells to which the erythrocytes adhered were infected. This phenomenon would thus facilitate the selection of suitable areas in the tissue culture for electron microscopic studies. Titers increased quickly after 10 days and showed a tendency to decrease after 30 days. Cartwright\u00a3/ al.

            "text": "Serum neutralization (SN) is a powerful method used to assess antigenic relationships. The efficiency with which a certain antiserum to virus A reduces the infectivity of either virus A or virus B indicates the relatedness of those two viruses. Dalldorf noted in 1961 that H-3 and RV cross neutralize each other, while H-l was neutralized only by H-l antiserum (Toolan, 1968) . Later, Toolan (1964) observed that HT and H-l antisera are equally efficient in reducing the infectivity of either agent but not of other agents. HB also proved to be unrelated to the other rodent viruses. Other viruses whose homologous antisera interfere with the infectivity of H-3 and RV include the LS, X14, Kirk, and HER agents (Lum and Schreiner, 1963; Payne et al., 1964; ElDadah et al., 1967) . The homologous immune sera possess, however, a considerably higher SN titer than do the heterologous sera (Moore, 1962; Lum and Schreiner, 1963; Portella, 1964) . No relationships of these rodent osteolytic viruses could be demonstrated with the various AAV types (Hoggan, 1971) .",

However, in conjunction with these tests, Cross and Parker (1972) also conducted fluorescence tests, and in contrast to the other tests, the latter suggested the presence of a common antigen. It should be borne in mind that in the immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase tests, the antisera are tested on infected cells and not, as with the other tech niques, with purified virus. Pulse-chase experiments with infected cells did not reveal the presence of nonstructural proteins, and therefore the antigen in com mon was suspected to be a host cell protein. This protein could have been present in the cell-free but otherwise unpurified tissue culture harvests of these viruses. However, the recent discovery of a covalent association of a protein with replica tive DNA of parvovirus H-l (Revie et al., 1979) offers other possible explana tions. This protein, which is not found in mature H-l virions, could have the same antigenic determinants as similar proteins (if present) of other parvoviruses. Therefore, there might be a viral replication-related protein of parvoviruses, hitherto considered unrelated. The finding of Astell et al. (1979) that the nucleotide sequences of the 3' termini of the DNA from these rodent parvoviruses are quite similar for at least the first 115 nucleotides implies a closer relationship between these viruses than was expected by the serological methods. Hoggan (1971) also demonstrated an immuno-fluorescence cross-reaction between RV and H-l, in contrast to the results with SN. On the other hand, among the various AAV serotypes, he could show an immunofluorescence cross reaction only be tween AAV-2 and AAV-3, despite DNA homology studies demonstrating a 27-37% genome relatedness of these AAVs (Rosela/., 1968).",

Negative staining of virus without prior treatment with specific antivirus antiserum may often result in a very sparse distribution of virus par ticles; also, different parvoviruses are virtually indistinguishable by electron microscopy. Virus suspensions treated with specific antiglobulin result in the formation of virus-antibody complexes which adhere to the grid and can readily be recognized in the electron microscope, even at low magnification (Karasaki, 1966) . The aggregates have a strong tendency to stick to the surface of the supporting film so that cellular debris is easily eliminated by subsequent washings. Karasaki (1966) observed that a low antibody concentration (e.g., 1:640) pro vided optimal conditions and that with this technique even capsid architecture could be studied. Yates et al. (1973) obtained an efficient aggregation using concentrated antiserum solutions (1:2 or 1:10), but the fibrous material (anti body) around the virions obscured their fine structure.

Herpes and adenoviruses are also known to be able to induce segregation of the nucleolus (Sirtori and Bosisio-Bestetti, 1967; Matsui and Bernhard, 1967; Philips and Raskas, 1972) . A low level of a-amanitin, which also causes nucleolus segregation, inhibits AAV RNA synthesis (Bloom and Rose, 1978; Jay et al., 1978) . This is consis tent with the involvement of cellular RNA polymerase II with parvovirus tran scription. Though the nucleolus appears to have an affinity for the parvoviral proteins (Singer and Toolan, 1975) , actinomycin D, which prevents nucleolar function, does not inhibit the formation of the H-l hemagglutination factor (Rhode, 1973) .",

Recent attempts to elucidate the tran scription process in parvoviruses revealed a more complicated mechanism. Tal et al. (1979) found that, after polyadenylation, about 30% of the RNA of the primary transcript of the MVM genome is spliced out. The poly(A) nuclear MVM RNA annealed to virtually the entire length of the viral genome. At one end of the genome a Y-shaped structure is obtained. One of the two arms of this structure is a duplex and the other is a single-stranded end. This could correspond to the hairpin duplex of the genome and the poly(A) 3' terminus of the RNA. At the other end of the duplex, there is a single-stranded region of varying length (up to 150 bases), and Tal et al. (1979) concluded that the transcription starts within the 3' end of the viral chromosome. These authors demonstrated that the cytoplasmic RNA is about 30% shorter than the nuclear RNA. They showed that the nuclear RNA consists of three parts: (1) the leader (about 9%); (2) the intervening sequences (about 30%), which are spliced out (the intron); and (3) the body (about 61%), which is thought to code for the viral protein(s). Their studies did not indicate whether more viral RNAs are present. However, studies with H-l (Green et al., 1979) indicated evidence for a single transcriptional unit and multiple-spliced polyadenylated transcripts.",

It is not yet clear if these proteins arise from posttranslational proteolytic cleavages, by processing at the nascent polypeptide level, or by the translation of different cytoplasmic mRNAs (Tijssen and Kurstak, 1981) . The importance of different proteins with similar sequence homologies is not clear, though it has been shown that maturation of these proteins may influence the infectivity of MVM (see Tattersall et al., 1977) . The assembly of the virion involves only secondary linkages among the constituent proteins, similar to the interaction of an antibody with its antigen (Tijssen and Kurstak, 1981) . These provirions encapsidate the single-stranded DNA in an as yet unknown way. Almost no free single-stranded viral DNA can be detected during infection (Rhode, 1974; Mayor and Jordan, 1976; Siegl and Gautschi, 1976) . This suggests that the provirion separates the two strands while encapsidating one of them. This model is sup ported by the finding (Rhode, 1976 ) that a mutant of H-l virus, which is temper ature sensitive due to an unstable capsid at higher temperatures, replicates DNA but does not produce progeny DNA at the nonpermissive temperature. Tattersall et al. (1977) demonstrated that the MVM virus becomes infectious only after the cleavage of B protein into C protein (molecular weight:61,000) while releasing a small peptide of about 3000 daltons. The A protein (molecular weight: 83,000), which contains the complete B sequence, is not cleaved, sug gesting that this cleavage site is buried inside the complete immature virion. It is also of interest that the sequence unique to A (about 180 amino acids) is rather basic (Tattersall et al., 1977) . This basic stretch might interact with the DNA in the full particles since no histones are incorporated . On the other hand, Kelly and Elliott (1977) showed that DNV DNA binds polyamines (organic polycations, namely putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) which may neutralize, at least partially, the negative charges of the DNA.",

The host range can be revealed by the presence of naturally occurring antibodies, since those animals have been exposed to the correspond ing virus under natural conditions. In addition to healthy laboratory or wild animals, antibodies can also be found in germ-free animals. Toolan et al. (1960) , Ferm and Kilham (1964) , and Kilham and Margolis (1966b) observed that at least some of the parovivurses can be transmitted vertically (by transplacental infections). In addition to these natural hosts, parvoviruses may infect a range of experimental hosts, especially neonates. Early parvovirus isolates (RV, H-l, H-3) were able, when introduced into newborn hamsters, to produce a facial bone malformation. Therefore, these agents were named \"hamster osteolytic viruses.\" As Toolan and Ellem (1979) pointed out, this unfortunate designation led to the belief that parvoviruses were isolated from hamsters when, in reality, no naturally occurring parvovirus has been obtained from these animals. Another case of the controversy on the origin of parvoviruses is demonstrated by the H-1, HB, and HT history. After inoculation of human tumors or other fast-growing tissues into neonate hamsters, these viruses could be isolated, whereas numerous blind passages of hamster tumors or embryos in newborn hamsters were negative (Toolan, 1961 (Toolan, , 1964 (Toolan, , 1968 . Therefore, Toolan considered some of the H vi ruses to be of human origin. On the other hand, Kilham and Margolis (1969) isolated H-l virus from rat tissues. In contrast to the low incidence of antibodies to H-l virus in humans, Kilham and Margolis (1969) detected H-l antibodies in about 80% of both wild and laboratory rats.",

Among the AAV serotypes, none could be related to a disease. It has even been shown that AAV may suppress the replication of their adenovirus helpers or other viruses and, therefore, may mediate among others a reduction in the number of adenovirus-caused tumors. An interesting example is provided by Pronovost et al. (1978) . They observed that the avian AAV reduced the pathogenicity of an adenovirus infection in vivo. Groups of chickens were infected with Tipton virus alone or in combination with high or low doses of avian AAV. In both trials they found that the associated virus delayed and reduced chick mortality. This effect was dose dependent and significant at the higher dose level.

This rabbit was experimentally infected with herpesvirus cuniculi and was free of anti-RPV antibodies prior to the inoculation; three other rabbits inoculated with this herpesvirus remained RPV free, so this virus probably was not a mere contaminant of this herpesvirus stock. The herpesvirus also might have activated a preexisting parvovirus infection. These investigators observed that among 90 \"normal\" rabbits, about 50% had an HI antibody titer of 16 or more to their isolate. Further experiments are needed to clarify this issue. Binn et al. (1970) isolated a parvovirus from the feces of dogs showing no signs of a clinically apparent infection.

They described the clinical manifestations of parvoviral enteritis and panleukopenia in 2-week to 1-year-old dogs. The histopathology of CEV is extremely similar to that of FPV/MEV. The morbidity is high and the mortality approaches 50%. Their isolate can also be propagated in feline cells but fails to grow in canine cells. In contrast to Gagnon and Povey (1979) , Black et al. (1979) discerned a serological cross-reactivity between CEV and PPV. McMaster et al. (1981) , however, found by restriction site mapping that of 79 mapped sites 86% were found to be common to the DNA of CEV and FPV/MEV.",

            "text": "PPV is widespread in pig populations. Cartwright and Huck (1967) and Mengeling (1972) found one-third of pigs examined in England, Scotland, and the United States to possess antibodies to PPV. They also recovered PPV from about 90% of pigs from herds with reproductive failures. However, most isolates were ob tained from pigs with clinically inapparent infections (Mayr et al., 1968; Bach mann, 1969; Cartwright et al., 1969) . Early experiments with infection of antibody-free pregnant gilts or piglets by PPV resulted only in a viremia and mild leukopenia (Mayr et al., 1968; Johnson and Collings, 1969; Cartwright et al., 1971) . Nevertheless, recent reports associate PPV with mummification and fetal deaths in pigs and confirm the interesting results reported by Bachmann et al. (1975) on experimental in utero infections. Mengeling (1978) examined slaugh tered sows, which had been gravid for over 60 days, for dead fetuses and embryos. Dead fetuses were found in one-third of the litters (203), of which 75% contained PPV. The fetuses of the PPV-infected litters were mostly mummified (84%). Virtually all contained the viral antigen, whereas only half of the live litters possessed this antigen. Similar observations on outbreaks of mummifica tion and abortion in commercial piggeries were made in Australia (Gillick, 1977; Forman et al., 1977) . Experimental porcine parvovirus infections of fetal pigs resulted in abortion, histological changes, and antibody formation (Hogg et al., 1977) . Intrauterine inoculations at later stages of gestation appear to increase the chance of survival of the fetuses (Lenghaus et al., 1978) . This seems to be directly related to the increased number of mononuclear cells then present in many tissues (Lenghaus et al., 1978) . Though these results demonstrated that the pig is the natural host for PPV, it may also be the host of a number of other parvovirus isolates, such as the PPV-related KBSH virus. Studies by Croghan et al. (1973) suggested that viruses related to PPV may have been transmitted to the cultures by the use of trypsin (of porcine origin). Many of the 38 isolates obtained from permanent cell lines (Hallauer et al., 1971) appear closely related to PPV.",

The purification of virus from minced organs (especially kidneys) of infected animals or cell cultures relies on the findings that these viruses dissociate from cellular material at high pH, at low ionic strength, and in the presence of EDTA . A rapid isolation procedure is often essential, since extensive proteolysis is known to occur during parvovirus purification. After homogenization or lysis of infected cells with trypsin and deoxycholate (Berns and Rose, 1970) , pelleting of the cellular debris and, if necessary, lipid extraction, two different approaches are possible for further purification and concetration of the virus: (1) differential centrifugation or, if possible, (2) precipitation of the virus, e.g., with 25 mM CaCb . These steps are followed by sedimenta tion on a sucrose gradient and (or directly) on an isopycnic CsCl density gradi ent. On CsCl gradients, several bands of virus may be obtained which are often not resolved in the sucrose step (see Section IV D). ",

Parvoviruses may sometimes pass the placenta in pregnant animals, often with serious consequences for the fetus (e.g., abortion, stillbirth, malformation). Infection of newborn animals will affect particularly the fast-growing tissues (leading to, e.g., ataxia).

Originally, these two syndromes were, therefore, thought to be caused by two different viruses-feline ataxia virus (FAV), isolated by Kilham and Margolis (1966a) , and FPV, isolated by Verge and Christoferoni (1928)-but Johnson et al.

Fever and listlessness, accompanied by a gradual decline in white blood cell counts, are followed by vomiting, loss of appetite (anorexia), dehydration, and depression, and sometimes by diarrhea or other side effects, depending on simultaneous infections by other agents. Ichijo et al. (1976) reported clinical and hematological findings and myelograms ob tained from natural and experimental cases of feline panleukopenia. The initial clinical symptoms in experimental cases were detected the third day after inocu lation. The characteristic hematological changes in the peripheral blood included neutrocytopenia, eosinocytopenia, and monocytopenia. Ichijo et al. (1976) also observed in all (experimental and natural) cases a drastic decrease in nucleated cells, in particular immature cells of the myeloid and erythroid series in the aspirated bone marrow. In animals with advanced leukopenia, the white blood cell counts drop until the fifth day, when less than 1000 cells/mm 3 were observed for fatal cases. Schultz et al. (1976) demonstrated that FPV has its primary immunosuppressive effect on T-cell activity, but that this effect is not so severe as for feline leukemia viruses in kittens or canine distemper virus in dogs. Inoculation of germ-free and specific-pathogen-free cats resulted in anorexia and a slight diarrhea (Carlson et al., 1977) . Both the germ-free and the specific-pathogenfree cats had thymic involution. None of the cats died in these experiments of Carlson et al. It is of interest to note that Bittle et al. (1961) were able to induce the classical syndrome including vomiting, pyrexia, dehydration, and diarrhea only by dual infection of the cats by FPV and a myxovirus. Hammon and Enders (1939) reported, in addition to leukopenia, the occur rence of mild anemia. Syverton et al. (1943) and Lawrence et al. (1943) described the malady in detail: extreme granulocytopenia; less pronounced leu kopenia; hypoplasia with absence of differentiation of the myeloid cells of the bone marrow; proliferation of reticuloendothelial cells of lymph nodes and spleen; and intranuclear inclusion bodies in the cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa, lymph nodes, and bronchial mucosa. The liver, pancreas, and kidney respond late to the disease (Lucas and Riser, 1945) and, in parallel with the viral replication in the lymphoid and blood-forming tissues, the mucosa of the small intestine is slightly damaged in the terminal portion before the process extends to the duodenum. In both there is an extreme destruction of villi and epithelium of the crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn. The fine structure of the epithelial cells of Lieberk\u00fchn's crypts during infection has been studied in detail by electron microscopy (Okaniwa et al., 1977) . The most important changes associated with the replication of FPV in the nucleus were alterations in the lining epithelial cells of the crypts.",

Initial studies on the pathogenicity of this virus were confusing since PPV could be isolated not only from stillborn, aborted, and mummified fetuses or from pigs with reproductive failures but also from apparently healthy piglets (Cartwright and Huck, 1967) . These results were confirmed by later studies (Section VII, B). Bachmann et al. (1975) studied the development of the fetuses infected in utero by direct inoculation in the amnioti\u00e7 fluid. They demonstrated that PPV, like all parvoviruses, has an affinity for mitotic cells. This explains the high susceptibility of the young fetuses for this virus, whereas the infected sows do not show any clinical symptoms. Intrauterine infection of the fetuses at a younger age (35-, 48-, or 55-days-old) resulted in their death and mummification, whereas fetuses from sows infected at 72, 99, and 105 days of gestation survived. Their results confirmed studies by Cartwright et al. (1971) and Johnson and Collings (1971) , in which pregnant sows were orally or intravenously infected, that fe tuses infected at later stages did not result in abortions or stillbirths. This coin cides with the onset of immunological competence of the fetal pigs at 60-70 days of gestation (Done and Hebert, 1968; Jamrichova er al., 1971) . Intrauterine infections at later stages resulted in the development of a high antibody titer in utero (Bachmannetal., 1975) .",

            "text": "Many factors, such as immunocompetence, body temperature, gestational ages, period of infection, route of infection, and pathogenicity of the virus strains may all influence the outcome of the infection. This may also explain the con flicting results concerning the histopathology of infected fetuses reported by Nauta et al. (1975) , who recorded brain lesions, and Mengelingei al. (1975) and Cutlip and Mengeling (1975) , who failed to induce histological lesions. Transplacental crossing of PPV, similar to that of other parvoviruses such as FPV/MEV, was reported (Johnson and Collings, 1971 ). However, Bachmann et al. (1975) suggested that only very small quantities of virus pass the transplacental barrier. Body temperature of pigs, which is known to fluctuate considerably (average 39\u00b0C), may also have an influence on the replication of the virus, since the virus reproduces considerably better at lower temperatures (Bachmann, 1972) . Joo et al. (1977) demonstrated different patterns in histopathology and immu-nofluorescence in two groups of fetuses examined at about 62 and 95 days of gestation, respectively. Viral antigen could be detected by immunofluorescence only in fetuses which had not reached the stage of immuno-competence, i.e., 70 days of gestation (Joo et al., 1976a) . However, histopathological changes were constantly evident in older fetuses (Joo et al., 1977) . The immunofluorescence results of Joo et al. (1977) were in agreement with those obtained by Cutlip and Mengeling (1975) . Fluorescence was evident in the parenchyma of the lung, liver, and kidney and in the neurons and vascular endothelium of the cerebrum. Histopathological changes included perivascular lesions around veins and capil laries, often the brain (meningoencephalitis), and interstitial hepatitis and nephri tis. The degree of severity of cellular necrosis seems to depend on the gestational age (Hogg et al., 1977) . In older fetuses there is, in general, less cellular necrosis. Many histological changes seem to be caused by an immune response with cellular infiltrations; polymorphonuclear leukocytes were more prominent in lesions of the lung and placenta, and there were reactive changes in the lymphoid tissues. However, the etiology of the calcifications of the placenta (regardless of gestational age) is still uncertain.",

(1979) is similar to the myocarditis of probable viral origin, in pups of weaning age, described by Jezyk et al. (1979) . The latter also ob served cardiomegaly and cardiac arrhythmias in the surviving pups.",

(1971) suggest that this immunity might be actively acquired. More recent results by Hogg et al. (1977) indicated that the fetuses acquire immunity when the gilts are infected during gestation, but the virus also provokes histological lesions and abortions. Depending on the immunity of the queens, suckling kittens acquire a passive immunity (Johnson, 1965; Scott et al., 1970) . Kisary (1977) reported that laying geese naturally infected with DDV transmit IgG-type maternal immunoglobulins through the eggs to their offspring. These antibodies persisted until the third week of life (the half-life of these antibodies is about 6 days), confirming an earlier report by Kisary et al. (1975) . Kisary (1977) suggested, therefore, that the most efficient approach to protect goslings against DDV would be the active immunization of the laying flocks.",

Experimental infections usually result in a viremia about a week after the inocu lation (Toolan, 1965; Kilham and Margolis, 1969) . The first antibodies appear at about the same time, and the titer increases to a certain level and may then remain constant for a long time (Toolan, 1968) . This is readily explained by the existence of continuously produced virus. Instead, if weanling hamsters are infected with the osteolytic agents, the level drops after some time unless the animals are reinoculated. Therefore, virus production seems to be a prerequisite for the maintenance of high antibody titers. This model seems to be valid for the other parvoviruses as well: PPV: Bachmann (1969) ; MVM: Parker et al. (1970) ; FPV/MEV: Gorham and Hartsough (1955) ; . In the field,",

            "text": "passively acquired antibodies may, however, interfere with the development of an active immunity (Kisary, 1977) .Vaccination proved efficient in enhancing the active immunity. A live virus (FPV/MEV) vaccine attenuated on tissue culture has been developed (Gorham et al., 1965 (Gorham et al., , 1966 . Chappuis and Petermann (1979) recently discussed the prophy laxis of infectious panleukopenia in combination with other viruses (rhinotracheitis virus, herpesvirus, and calici virus). They presented an immunization program for these viruses with the different vaccines available. In the early control of DDV, goslings were protected by subcutaneous injections of convalescent serum (Coudert et al., 1973) . Kisary et al. (1978) attenuated the DDV agent according to the same principle as above for FPV/MEV. A serial transfer of the DDV agent in cultured goose embryo fibroblasts resulted in a mutant apathogenic for the goslings. Vaccinated geese had a considerably lower mortality, and the average weight of the animals was considerably higher.An inactivated virus vaccine was developed for the prevention of porcine parvo virus-induced reproductive failures (Mengeling et al., 1979) . In these ex periments, the virus was inactivated with acetylethyleneimine and the gilts were vaccinated intramuscularly before they were bred and were subsequently ex posed orally to virulent PPV on the ninetieth day of gestation. After 12 weeks of gestation, the gilts were killed and the litters examined for the presence of virus or antibodies. Neither could be detected in the fetuses of the vaccinated gilts, in contrast to the fetuses of the control gilts. Moreover, of the latter, 26 of the 37 fetuses were dead.It is also evident from Section IX that general hygienic measures will be of great importance for the effective control of parvoviruses. Newly acquired ani mals should be kept separate from others. As Balogh (1973) has demonstrated, this helps significantly to reduce the incidence of the disease. Also, disinfection and importation controls often may be important.",
