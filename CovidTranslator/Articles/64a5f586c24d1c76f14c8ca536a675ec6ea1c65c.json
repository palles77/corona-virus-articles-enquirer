            "text": "Despite decreasing TB-associated mortality in Taiwan, in 2008, TB was still ranked the 15 th highest cause of death, with three deaths per 100,000 population. By contrast, the mortality rates in the United States, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and Vietnam in 2006 were 0.5, 2, 3, 5, 10 and 7, respectively. 1 In 2006, the Stop TB Plan 2006-2015 was launched by the World Health Organization (WHO), with the goal of halving TB incidence and mortality by 2015. 3 To further TB control efforts, in 2006 the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) additionally launched the \"Program to Halve TB Incidence in Ten Years\", based on the objectives of the WHO. Control efforts included an expanded directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) program for sputum-smearpositive cases in 2006, and a DOTS-plus strategy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients, which consisted of five medical care teams, conducting therapy for latent TB among children < 12 years of age, and the commissioning of academic institutions to administer intervention programs in 2007. 4 The aim of the present study was to describe the epidemiology of TB in Taiwan over the past 7 years (2002-2008) and to evaluate preliminary changes in incidence and mortality rates.",

This might be explained by the tendency of physicians to use radiography as a diagnostic tool rather than sputum examinations, poor patient adherence to sputum collection, In addition to executing the NTP, Hsinchu County started a special program in coordination with the Community Medicine Research Center, National Yang-Ming University, and Human Rights Education Foundation. This program was designed to compile educational materials on TB prevention and human rights, coordinate efforts with local health bureaus, recruit volunteer healthcare workers and organize various community education efforts to help residents learn about signs and symptoms of TB and about treatment options. The program also involves the use of a simple screening method, 16 so that the residents can be made aware of their lung conditions, receive chest X-ray examinations, and discover silent cases at an early stage. As a result of these efforts, the TB incidence in this region increased in 2006, while the mortality declined. In 2007 and 2008, declines in incidence continued, but the mortality rate rose. Continued assessment of the long-term effectiveness of these prevention efforts is warranted. In 1947, there were 18,533 deaths due to TB in Taiwan, accounting for 16.2% of the total deaths that year (a rate of 294 per 100,000 population). In 1985, TB was excluded from the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan for the first time. 5 In 2002, there were < 1,000 TB-associated deaths, and in 2004, TB dropped to 13 th on the list of causes of death. TB prevention efforts seem to be working, based on declining mortality rates year by year. Nonetheless, the 2008 mortality rate was 3.3 per 100,000 population, which was higher than in developed countries, including the United States (< 1 per 100,000 population), Japan (3 per 100,000 population), and Singapore (2 per 100,000 population). 1 Although older age is significantly associated with death, 17 the age distribution of TB patients in Taiwan was similar to that in Japan and Singapore, namely > 50% were aged > 50 years old; however, the mortality, in those countries was lower than that in Taiwan. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic presents a massive challenge to TB control programs worldwide. 18 Although, under the implementation of a harm-reduction program in 2006, the number of HIV cases has declined in Taiwan, 19 it is worth noting that HIV is the main reason for failure to meet TB control targets in countries with a high prevalence of HIV infection. If we fail to control HIV effectively, the decline in incidence and mortality rate might be threatened; therefore, close monitoring of HIV-related TB remains essential in Taiwan. In addition, MDR-TB, a man-made problem, significantly contributes to the TB burden worldwide. 20 Molecular epidemiology studies have suggested that some M. tuberculosis strains are able to disseminate more quickly than others, and can therefore thwart preventive efforts. [21] [22] [23] Thus, close surveillance of MDR-TB prevalence and vigilant treatment are very important. Although the DOTS-Plus program has been promoted by the Taiwan CDC since 2007, special attention must be paid to MDR-TB according to WHO recommendations.",

The initial evaluation of its effectiveness in its first 3 years suggests that it has been effective in reducing TB-associated incidence and mortality. Sustained monitoring of the effectiveness of the NTP is necessary. Furthermore, in cities and counties that have seen an increase in TB, local health authorities and the CDC need to focus their efforts on controlling TB and investigating the reasons for its increase, with special attention paid to rigorous surveillance of rate fluctuations, especially regarding TB incidence.",
