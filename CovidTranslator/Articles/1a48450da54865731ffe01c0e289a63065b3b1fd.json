Actually, all of the rRT-PCR-negative patients had CT image features compatible with COVID-19. Moreover, the high false-negativity of rRT-PCR (about 20-40%) 25 presents a significant burden on health care providers to use their clinical judgment. And chest CT has a higher sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 than rRT-PCR. 25 Several underlying reasons including uneven quality from different detection kits, improper collection of throat swab specimens, and low concentration of virus in samples 26 can lead to the possible results deviation. Therefore, including the rRT-PCR-negative patients was an important measure to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan. We found that patients in the severe or critical disease groups were more likely to be rRT-PCR positive.Survival analysis also corroborated that rRT-PCR-positive patients showed poorer clinical outcomes.",
