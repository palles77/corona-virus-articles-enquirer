We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.",

Overall, the duration from travel to first event (whether symptom onset, or hospitalization for asymptomatic) was also longer, although the difference was not statistically significant (5.0 \u00b1 0.9 days vs. 3.7 \u00b1 0.5 days p= 0.08). Durations of hospitalization were instead comparable among the two groups of cases (1.5 \u00b1 0.7 days vs. 2.6 \u00b1 0.4 days for cases that generated or did not generate secondary transmissions, respectively). Including imported cases with missing information through imputation, we found the same trend though smaller in magnitude and not statistically significant (delay from travel to hospitalization 9.8 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 8.3 \u00b1 0.5 days p= 0.3; delay from travel to onset 5.8 \u00b11.1 vs. 4.2 \u00b10.5 p= 0.16, for cases that generated or did not generate secondary transmissions, respectively).

Exportations from other Chinese provinces and other countries grew at a considerably slower pace. This is related to the difference in the increase of cases between Hubei province, origin of the outbreak, and the rest of the affected areas 1 .

The current situation in Italy, with different clusters emerging in the timeframe of few hours in different areas in the North of the country 14 , shows that clusters have gone undetected and epidemiological links with the index case are still missing. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.
