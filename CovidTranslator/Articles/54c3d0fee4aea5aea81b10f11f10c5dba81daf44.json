Oseltamivir phosphate dissociates in the gastrointestinal tract to form oseltamivir, which is absorbed and metabolised into oseltamivir carboxylate by hepatic carboxylesterase (h-CE). Oseltamivir may have a central depressant action (Hama 2008 ) and may also inhibit human sialidase (Li 2007) , causing abnormal behaviour. Inhaled zanamivir reaches a far lower plasma concentration compared to its intravenous administration (Cass 1999) . Any treatment that reduces the complications of influenza (for example, pneumonia) and the excretion of the virus from infected people might be a useful public health measure to contain an epidemic by limiting the impact and spread of the virus. In addition to symptomatic treatment, prophylactic use for interrupting the spread of disease has informed pandemic planning over the past decade.",

These recommendations are based on the claimed and assumed ability of the drug to reduce complications and transmission (HHS 2005; WHO 2007 ).

To resolve inconsistencies and under-reporting, we changed our approach by no longer including trial data as reported in papers published in biomedical journals. Instead, we treated clinical study reports as our basic unit of analysis. Clinical study reports are often sent to national drug regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) (formerly EMEA), which require far more stringent standards for completeness and accuracy of reporting than biomedical journals. Journal articles can be regarded as a very succinct synthesis of a clinical study report. In addition to seeking clinical study reports, we decided to read and review regulatory documentation. The FDA in particular (and the EMA to a far lesser extent) make many of its scientific reviews available on its website. Unlike Cochrane review authors, regulators can have access to the whole data set and their comments can provide useful insight, helping to achieve a better understanding of trial programmes. Clinical study reports generally remain hidden from public view and are not readily available for wider scientific scrutiny, despite the wealth of information they contain for those willing and able to spend the time reading them and despite calls to make all relevant trial data public (Doshi 2013; Godlee 2009), as well as the known problems with reporting biases (McGauran 2010; Wieseler 2013).",

Novel A/H1N1 is a new strain of a subtype that has been circulating since 1977, but it also resembles the A/H1N1 strain that has been circulating since before 1957 (CDC 2009) or before the 1918 pandemic (Itoh 2009). Influenza subtype A/ H1N1 was indeed circulating in the clinical trials we have included in our previous reviews. In addition, oseltamivir and zanamivir were approved by regulators worldwide for the treatment and prevention of influenza types A and B, not specific subtypes or strains of influenza A and B. The expectation of regulatory approval is thus that the effects of these drugs demonstrated in clinical trials will apply to future strains of influenza A and B. Use of these drugs during the pandemic was not off-label. It was approved use because of the assumption that the clinical trial evidence underpinning regulatory approval applied to novel A/H1N1. We reviewed the clinical trial evidence with the expectation that our results, similar to regulators, will apply to all influenza viruses.",

There seems to be no compelling reason to think that the lessons learned are limited to these particular drugs (Godlee 2009; Rodgers 2013; Vedula 2009; Vedula 2013; Wieseler 2013). For this reason, our independent scrutiny, using all possible trial information, may inform both the wider debate on the adequacy of existing regulatory frameworks in the adoption of new drugs and the question of whether other systematic reviews should move to this new, more rigorous, approach, which focuses on trial programmes rather than single trials (Eyding 2010; Ioannidis 2010) (see Glossary, Appendix 1). Although there is substantial evidence for the effects of reporting bias in estimates of effectiveness, less is known of its impact on the evidence of harms (Chou 2005) . We decided to quantify the additional resources required to follow our modified methodological approach to assess the feasibility of other systematic reviews proceeding in a similar fashion.

Interruption of transmission (in its two components, reduction of viral spread from index cases and prevention of onset of influenza in contacts) 4 . Harms 1. Drug resistance 2. Viral excretion 3. Mortality Whilst overall symptom reduction is well documented, our interest was particularly focused on complications and adverse events, as this is where evidence is currently scarce or inconclusive (Jefferson 2009a ; Shun-Shin 2009). Our preliminary examination of some regulatory documents and some published versions of the studies had identified that some symptoms and sequelae of influenza (such as pneumonia) had been classified as either a 'complication of influenza' or as an 'adverse event of the treatment', or both. This is somewhat confusing and we intended to analyse 'compliharms' (see Glossary, Appendix 1) irrespective of the classification as a 'complication of influenza' or as an 'adverse event of the treatment' (Appendix 3) in oseltamivir trials. Complications of particular interest included pneumonia, bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis as these were the secondary illnesses often collected in the Roche oseltamivir trials and we agreed that these events are clinically important. Initially we constructed a table to illustrate the design methodology used for each complication by study ( Table  1 ). The table included the following variables: definition of which events are termed complications; where complications are first defined in the clinical study report; diagnosis method; and availability of data. We then stratified our analysis by method of diagnosis with three possible criteria: (1) laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (e.g. based on radiologically or microbiologically confirmed evidence of infection); (2) clinical diagnosis without laboratory confirmation (diagnosed by a doctor after a clinical examination); (3) other type of diagnosis such as self reported by patient. We conducted analysis of any complication (pneumonia, bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis) that was classified as serious or led to study withdrawal. In all cases of influenza complications reporting (pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis media) there is a variable degree of participant self reporting, of investigator mediation (for example, in writing down the details in the case report form) and lack of verification with investigations such as culture or imaging. The 'self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified' title is relevant to all complications but for brevity we use it as sparingly as possible. For harms we were limited by the frequency of occurrence of the adverse events collected in the trials. Consequently we meta-analysed (1) all serious adverse events; (2) all adverse events leading to study withdrawal; (3) all withdrawals; (4) all adverse events within a clinical study report's defined body system; as well as (5) a small group of common adverse events as defined in the FDA drug label for oseltamivir. There were too few events to meta-analyse (1) deaths; (2) serious adverse events by body system; and (3) any events that had an overall incidence of less than 0.5%. We did not meta-analyse outcomes with fewer than 10 events in total. We conducted analyses separately for on-treatment and off-treatment periods. However, in two cases where (on-treatment) treatment effects were borderline statistically significant (prophylaxis with oseltamivir: renal body system on-treatment and psychiatric body system on-treatment), we conducted additional analysis combining on-and off-treatment periods to maximise statistical power. We conducted dose-response harms analysis for two treatment trials (WV15670 and WV15671) combined and one prophylaxis study (WV15673/WV15697), as these trials investigated the active agent at multiple doses. These studies included standard-dose and high-dose oseltamivir arms. For these analyses we used logistic regression, adjusting for study effects if appropriate (i.e. for the two treatment trials) and testing for trend using a likelihood ratio test. We tested the hypothesis that increased dose of drug leads to increased incidence of adverse effects.",

For consistency we adopted this method for both the 'Summary of findings' tables and for the RDs reported in the text. For the analysis we chose to report the RRs as they are more consistent across the studies, and we have reported the heterogeneity for the pooled RR. We reinterpreted the results using the RD as this result is applicable to clinical decision-making. We calculated mean differences (MDs) for time to first alleviation of symptoms. For time to first alleviation of symptoms we also estimated the treatment effect as the percentage reduction in the average time to first alleviation of symptoms in the placebo group. Most zanamivir clinical study reports only reported treatment effects in terms of medians in each treatment group as well as P values from a hypothesis test comparing the time-to-event distributions. These data are insufficient for conducting meta-analysis. However, often sufficient time-to-event data were reported to allow us to estimate restricted means and standard deviations. Restricted means are based on the maximum time reported where alleviation occurred. There were some patients where alleviation was censored at the maximum follow-up time, therefore restricted means are under-estimates of the true means. However, the proportion of patients censored was generally low and similar in both treatment arms, hence this limitation is unlikely to have led to bias. The length of follow-up varied across trials and this has led to high variation in the estimated means and standard deviations (SDs) across trials. A post hoc analysis was undertaken after we discovered seven zanamivir trials provided data on time to first alleviation of symptoms with and without relief medication. Each patient in the studies may or may not have taken relief medication during the trial. Alleviation of symptoms may have occurred while the patient was taking relief medication and the \"standard\" comparison was made using this scenario. However, an additional analysis used a stricter definition where alleviation of symptoms could only be achieved without the use of relief medication. For example, a patient may have achieved alleviation using relief medication after five days but took seven days to achieve alleviation without the use of relief medication. The comparison we reported is for all patients where we used the stricter definition for the zanamivir group (alleviation without relief medication) and the less strict definition for the placebo group (alleviation with relief medication). We planned to use the tri-dimensional dose-relatedness, timing and patient susceptibility (DoTS) methodology to assess the likelihood of harms causality (Aronson 2003) , but the quality of the data available did not allow for this.",

For all other outcomes we used the random-effects approach for binary data of DerSimonian and Laird, where Tau 2 was estimated using the inverse variance method. Whilst overall symptom reduction is well documented, our interest was particularly focused on complications and adverse events, as this is where evidence is currently scarce or inconclusive (Jefferson 2009a ; Matheson 2007; Shun-Shin 2009). Our preliminary examination of clinical study reports identified that some symptoms and sequelae of influenza (such as \"pneumonia\") had been classified as either a 'complication of influenza' or as an 'adverse event of the treatment' or both. We called this somewhat confusing classification 'compliharms'. We decided to deal with compliharms as follows. We identified complications of particular clinical interest as \"pneumonia\", bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. We tabulated the type of data capture used for each complication (\"secondary illness\") by study including the following variables: definition of what events are termed complications, which part of the clinical study report captured data on complications, who reported and captured the data, which diagnostic method was used, whether and where the diagnostic pathway was (usually a form) and whether prescription for treatment were captured. We then aimed to stratify our analysis by method of diagnosis with three possible criteria: (1) laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (e.g. based on radiological-or microbiologically-confirmed evidence of infection); (2) clinical diagnosis without laboratory-confirmation (diagnosed by a doctor/investigator after a clinical examination); (3) other type of diagnosis such as self-reported by patient. We also conducted analysis of any complication (such as \"pneumonia\", bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis) that was classified as serious or led to study withdrawal.",

However the clinical study reports of prophylaxis trials do not define influenza-like illness but report eight different definitions for influenza with laboratory-confirmation (see web extra influenza definitions). This is a complex and confusing set of definitions where, for example, the definition for Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) with systemic disturbance is the same as one of the definitions for asymptomatic influenza. After discovering the absence of a definition for influenza-like illness and the complex and confusing definitions for laboratory-confirmed influenza, we classified influenza-like illness as two or more symptoms from the following: nasal congestion, headache, chills/sweats, sore throat, cough, fatigue, myalgia and fever. These were the symptoms reported in the efficacy listing of individual patients in Module 3 of the prophylaxis trials clinical study reports. In two oseltamivir treatment trials (WV15670; WV15671) and one prophylaxis study (WV15673/WV15697) there were three treatment arms comparing placebo, standard dose and high dose. For time to first alleviation of symptoms we restricted comparison to placebo versus standard dose (as this is how it was reported in the original report). However, for all other outcomes we combined the standard and high-dose treatment arms. There was little apparent difference in the incidence of outcomes between the standard and high-dose arms and combining the arms did not appear to cause heterogeneity. However, in two cases there was some evidence of a dose-response effect. These cases are described more fully in the Results section under 'Analysis of harms'. The majority of zanamivir trials compared placebo with inhaled zanamivir. However, some trials also included an intranasal zanamivir treatment arm and a combined arm of inhaled and intranasal treatment. The multiple zanamivir arms were generally combined for meta-analysis as effects appeared similar and did not appear to cause heterogeneity.",

We investigated high estimates of heterogeneity, where possible, using subgroup analysis. For example, we conducted subgroup analysis of time to first alleviation of symptoms in studies of oseltamivir treatment in children by partitioning studies into those of otherwise healthy children and those of children with chronic illness (asthma). Based on a referee's comment, we conducted a subgroup analysis on time to first alleviation of symptoms by infection status for zanamivir. We could not do a similar analysis for oseltamivir because we did not have data on the non-influenza-infected patients and we could not correctly identify the patients with influenza infection due to the effect of oseltamivir on antibodies. In the trial programmes for both oseltamivir and zanamivir there was large variation in treatment effects for pneumonia across the populations studied (i.e. adults and children as well as treatment and prophylaxis), hence we conducted meta-regression to investigate this heterogeneity. We included all studies that reported pneumonia (32 studies in total) and investigated the four binary factors: age group (adults versus children); drug (oseltamivir versus zanamivir); indication (treatment versus prophylaxis) and method of diagnosis. For oseltamivir studies, the method of diagnosis was either based on data collected on non-specific adverse events or secondary/intercurrent illness forms or data collected on specific \"diagnosis of secondary illness\" forms that included objective criteria such as X-ray confirmation. For zanamivir, two trials included X-ray confirmation of pneumonia. We conducted metaregression in Stata/SE, version 13 for Windows using the metareg command. There were some studies where one treatment group had zero events, therefore we added 0.5 events to all treatment groups for all studies prior to analysis. The dependent variable in the regression was log relative risk. A further post hoc analysis was undertaken after we discovered seven trials provided data on time to first alleviation of symptoms with and without relief medication. Each patient in the studies may or may not have taken relief medication during the trial. Alleviation of symptoms may have occurred while the patient was taking relief medication and the \"standard\" comparison was made using this scenario. However, an additional analysis used a stricter definition where alleviation of symptoms could only be achieved without the use of relief medication. For example, a patient may have achieved alleviation using relief medication after five days but took seven days to achieve alleviation without the use of relief medication. The comparison we reported is for all patients where we used the stricter definition for the zanamivir group (alleviation without relief medication) and the less strict definition for the placebo group (alleviation with relief medication).",

            "text": "We were able to download 2673 pages from the FDA website. The table of contents is in Table 2 , Table 3 , Table 4 and Table 5 . We used these pages to identify all trials that had been conducted within a drug's trial programme. There was no correlation between citation frequency of oseltamivir treatment trials in the FDA regulatory documents and trial size. The biggest treatment trial (M76001) is cited only four times in three documents, while other contemporary treatment trials are cited far more (WV15670; WV15671; WV15730; WV15812/WV15872; WV15707). WV15670, for example, is cited 46 times in the FDA documents. However, the combined enrolled denominator of the four treatment trials completed at the time (WV15670; WV15671; WV15707; WV15730) was 1442, smaller than M76001 (1459). This suggested that the FDA's regulatory evaluation of Roche's New Drug Application was based predominantly on what Roche had offered them as \"pivotal\" or trials that best demonstrated the properties of oseltamivir, not the complete evidence base of all oseltamivir trials. One possible alternative explanation for this observation could have been the interval between trial completion, generation of the report and New Drug Applications (NDA) submission. This explanation is supported by the relatively brief interval between completion of the M76001 trial (19 February 1999) and sub-mission (on 30 April 1999) of NDA 021087 to the FDA. However, the core part of the submission (the clinical development programme) contains data from two (at the time) ongoing trials (WV15819/WV15876/WV15978; WV15812/WV15872). The basis of the selection of trials to regulators is therefore unclear but appears to be dictated by criteria other than availability and size. The importance of trials (to manufacturers and possibly to regulators) may not be based on the same criteria that systematic reviewers would use (i.e. the capability of the trial to answer questions). Due to the vast size of FDA documents, sometimes hundreds of pages long, it was difficult to determine important emerging themes solely by reading. To identify items of interest in the FDA comments we used word clouds (Feinberg 2009). Word clouds give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in the source document. The resulting graphic representation showed words such as 'diary' and 'baseline' to be heavily mentioned in the relevant (abridged) text from the FDA's Medical Officer Review (FDA 1999c, PDF page 19) . Examining the 'diary' entry in more detail, we found the following FDA comment: \"The majority of subjects participating in the treatment trials had only used the first diary card. The second diary card was issued in 15% to 20% of participants. In response to FDA's request, the applicant provided a summary of diary card dispensing in the 8/6/99 submission. It became apparent that instructions on when to start a second diary card were not uniformly followed in WV15670, WV15671, and WV15730 trials. There were examples of patients who had alleviated symptoms yet also received a second diary card. Conversely, there were also examples of patients who did not alleviate all symptoms but did not receive a second diary card. Thus the second diary card was used inconsistently which is viewed as a flaw of these trials. The lack of consistency in collecting symptom information after alleviation precluded a complete documentation of symptom fluctuation. Also missing second diary cards in subjects who had not alleviated symptoms were responsible for the majority of censored data which may have potentially influenced the results of efficacy analysis. In order to address the impact of censoring, the applicant performed several sensitivity analyses which will be summarized in the Integrated Summary of Efficacy\". This comment highlights problems with the follow-up procedure of treatments trials, which may have impaired the regulator's ability to draw conclusions on the duration of effect of oseltamivir. It also provides a good example of how graphic methods can help identify crucial comments in vast regulatory files. Several other experiments with text from the same FDA document showed that the choice of text to be represented as a Word cloud heavily influenced cloud construction, visibility of words and hence our ability to detect important comments. It is for this reason that we decided to adopt a mixed approach: mapping citations while reading FDA comments and integrating such comments in our appraisal of the evidence. Regulatory comments were all the more important, because at the time we developed this method we had few clinical study reports and comments helped to identify the gaps in our knowledge of the trial programmes. Once the table of contents had been constructed, we postulated that given the huge work involved in reviewing lots of regulatory files, our new instrument could also help us by indicating which parts were more important than others, thus focusing our efforts. We experimented with a variety of methods reported in the Data collection and analysis section.",

To address the problem of reporting bias, we ignored published trial reports and directed our attention to clinical study reports and regulatory information. Our problems in reviewing the copious material at our disposal were how to identify and analyse important details in the midst of thousands of pages of information and how to construct a coherent appraisal of large and complex trial programmes. In addition, since we gained unrestricted access to the full clinical study reports (apart from personal de-identifying redactions) we took the view that all information needed to judge risk of bias should be present. Therefore when this information was not available, we judged the corresponding risk of bias element as at 'high' risk of bias. For example, when details of the random sequence generation are missing from journal publications of clinical trials, it is customary to record this as \"unknown\" risk of bias. This judgment usually carries the assumption that the random sequence generation details are available in more detailed reports. But when these details were still missing in even full clinical study reports, we chose to rate this risk of bias element at \"high\" risk of bias. In the following paragraphs we report some of the salient findings using the current Cochrane format but applying the logic of reviewing regulatory data.",

For example, hospitalisations were not reported in zanamivir trials and inconsistently reported in oseltamivir trials. The relevant data in this review come from a table of hospitalisations sent to us by Roche in late 2013. In addition, in some trials we were unable to track individual participants through tables, narratives and individual listings. The issue of compliharms impeded the ascertainment of harms in oseltamivir treatment trials (Appendix 1). We had difficulty in following the logic of compliharms, even with access to full clinical study reports. The definition of adverse events in the RCTs of oseltamivir and zanamivir is different from the ordinary definition of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E2D guideline, which is as follows: \"An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product\".

The FDA carried out the inspection in September 2000 at various trial sites in the US including the West Virginia site (which was responsible for enrolling many hundreds of participants). An FDA official letter reported several violations including failure to report serious harms to the sponsor (Roche) as the protocol required and in addition stated: \"... we view the statement in the payment section of the consent form used in the study that subjects '...will receive $300.00 for participating in and completing the study. No payment will be made to you if you withdraw from the study for personal reasons...' to be an improper procedure. When subjects are to be paid for participating in a study, the payment should be prorated for the subject's actual participation in the study in order to avoid the possibility of coercion\" (FDA 2000e, PDF page 177). However, the FDA allowed the data (which had been published a year earlier in a prime journal) to stand in support of Roche's application for the prophylaxis indication. We do not know whether the participant contract was standard (i.e. whether the observation of possible improper procedures could be generalised to other sites and other trials), but the document cited by the FDA inspector is the subject of one of our (as yet unfulfilled) Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. The possibility of financial pressure, if confirmed, could seriously confound drop-out rates because of harms or any other causes in prophylaxis trials. The significantly higher incidence of diarrhoea in placebo recipients of treatment trial WV15671 was identified by the FDA reviewers who remarked \"Diarrhea was reported more frequently among subjects receiving placebo than among subjects receiving Ro 64-0796 [oseltamivir] . Diarrhoea, although not specified as an inclusion criterion, has been documented to be a clinical manifestation of influenza infection. The reduction in the incidence of diarrhoea for the treatment groups compared with the placebo group could be considered as a possible treatment effect of Ro 64-0796\" (FDA 1999c). However, according to the Japanese Summary Basis for Approval (JSBA) of oseltamivir capsules for prophylaxis, diarrhoea was reported more frequently in the oseltamivir arm (49/986) than in the placebo group (38/973) in the summarised table of adverse events from three trials (WV15673/WV15697; WV15708; WV15825).

The oseltamivir trials showed a consistent trend of missing original protocols (except for M76001), changing outcome definitions while the trial was running, protocol amendments even after the trial had been completed, inconsistent approaches to outcome data collection, missing statistical analysis plans, missing date of unblinding and the use of self reported outcomes such as pneumonia (M76001; WV15670; WV15671; WV15707; WV15730; WV16277). This represent 55% of pneumonia event data. As an example, in trial WV15670, secondary illnesses were patient reported. The body of the clinical study report states that complications requiring antibiotic treatment were specified a priori but even in the final version of the protocol, for which we have the full text, there is no predefined list of secondary illnesses (i.e. no mention of pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis or otitis in the protocol), nor did complications have anything to do with antibiotic treatment according to the protocol, nor does the Case Report Form mention specific secondary illnesses by name. Zanamivir trials reported outcomes not specified in the protocol provided. We found evidence of possible selective reporting bias when we analysed the JSBA data on prophylaxis. The regulatory data reports tables for individual trials as well as 10 pages of summarised tables for three trials of prophylaxis (WV15673/WV15697; WV15708; WV15825). Tables for individual trials include data for high-dose arms but report few psychiatric adverse events overall. However, the summarised tables list a variety of psychiatric adverse events including psychotic and suicidal adverse events, but not adverse events from the high-dose group. As a preliminary exploratory analysis, we combined the following suspected serious adverse events collectively: hallucination and delusion that are classified grade 3 (serious) by the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0 (NCI-CTC V2.0), psychosis (hallucination and delusion are the two major symptoms of this disease), suicidal attempt that is classified grade 3 (serious) by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 (CTCAE V4.0) and hostility that includes aggression, hostility, violence, murder and commonly considered as serious events though not listed in the NCI-CTC V2.0 or CTCAE V4.0. Numbers of suspected serious psychotic/suicidal adverse events (including hallucination, psychosis, schizophrenia, paranoia, aggression/hostility and attempted suicide) were five in the oseltamivir group and zero in the placebo group during the on-treatment period. When the off-treatment period data are added the total was eight versus one. The prophylaxis programme is crucial in understanding the harms profile of the drug as the potential for harms witnessed to be confounded by the apparently numerous symptoms and signs of influenza infection is far less, as many participants do not become infected with influenza. This makes a causality assessment more straightforward.",

Overall there was a non-significant 0.41 day decrease (95% CI 0.47 days lower to 1.29 days higher, I 2 statistic = 67%) in time to first alleviation of symptoms in the placebo with rescue medication group, suggesting that zanamivir itself is no better than rescue medication and possibly even less effective, although the varying levels of use of rescue medication in the seven trials did give rise to large heterogeneity (Analysis 3.68; Figure 6 ). In subgroup analysis of time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by infection status, we found no evidence of a difference in treatment effect for zanamivir on the influenza-infected subgroup compared to the non-influenza-infected subgroup (P = 0.53).

However, using our definition (see methods), oseltamivir did not reduce influenza-like illness in participants (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.06). The Roche trial programme assessing the effects of oseltamivir in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) submitted to the FDA on 22 May 2000 consisted of two trials: WV15799 and WV16139. We included only trial WV15799 because WV16139 was not placebo-controlled. WV15799 was a double-blind, cluster-randomised trial in which contact clusters of index cases were randomised to oseltamivir 75 mg a day or placebo for seven days. The manufacturer concluded that the trial proved that oseltamivir could prevent influenza in contacts by interrupting transmission from index cases. Interruption of transmission has two components: reduction of viral spread from index cases (measured by nasal shedding of influenza viruses) and prevention of onset of influenza in contacts measured with a mixture of symptoms and signs and 'laboratory confirmation' (i.e. viral culture from the upper airways and/or at least a four-fold rise in antibody titres measured between baseline and two to three weeks later). The design of the WV15799 is weak. All index cases were left untreated except for a paracetamol rescue pack, making it impossible to assess the effect of oseltamivir on nasal voidance of index cases. Nasal viral voidance was measured only in symptomatic participants thereby missing out on potential asymptomatic infected people. Zanamivir However, it did not reduce the risk of asymptomatic influenza in the prophylaxis of individuals (RR 0.97, 0.76 to 1.24, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 4.2) or asymptomatic individuals in post-exposure prophylaxis of households (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.20, I 2 statistic = 0%) (Analysis 4.4).

            "text": "Calls for incorporating unpublished data to supplement published trial data in systematic reviews and meta-analyses highlight deficiencies in the current methods for obtaining the most complete understanding of a drug's effects (Godlee 2010). Our methodological approach entailed comprehensive searching of unpublished sources, with a particular emphasis on obtaining unpublished and internal reports from drug manufacturers intended for regulatory submission and comments from national regulatory bodies. Our decision not to use published evidence as a basis for trial appraisal and data extraction meant that we had to reconcile and synthesise information from multiple unpublished sources. We had to devise a new method of searching, indexing, retrieving and reviewing trial data and to combine this understanding with regulatory comments to produce an informative review. The first step in this process entailed the need to develop our own reconstruction of the trial programme without initial help from outside sources. The reconstructed list of trials and then programmes took a wholetime-equivalent (WTE) researcher 20 days to compile. Due to the complexity of the task we suggest that in the future some of the essential phases, such as trial ID checking, be conducted in pairs. One of the comments received on our protocol suggested that discrepancies between published and unpublished versions of the same data set could be due to mistakes in the non-peer reviewed, unedited clinical study reports (which may be corrected by the time of publication). Our experience, especially with the non-reporting of serious adverse events, points to the opposite being the case (Jefferson 2011b) . Considering the fact that unintentional errors can occur, we believe the response should not be a resort to published papers as 'most accurate' and best unit of analysis, but rather that clinical study reports -as by far the most comprehensive record of a trial -remain the key unit of analysis, with the expectation that they be amended and kept as accurate as possible over time, with complete documentation of reasons for any amendments. We believed that the results of our review would be undermined without accessing a more complete body of evidence that we knew to be outside the public domain. In theory, trial registers would be expected to provide a comprehensive picture of a drug's trial programme. However, registers were not our primary instruments to reconstruct zanamivir and oseltamivir trial programmes. Both drugs' programmes were mainly run in the late 1990s, before trial registration became the norm. In addition, registers may suffer from some of the problems that we were trying to address. Bourgeois 2011 audited entries for 546 trials of five major classes of drugs on ClinicalTrials.gov, the biggest prospective register of clinical trials, and found evidence of risk of reporting bias and delay in reporting of results. Another review of 152 trials found that the description of 123 (or 81%) of the trials in the sample had been changed in at least one key element in the time between registration and publication. The most frequent changes regarded outcomes (Huic 2011). Despite the current limits of registers, both specifically to this review and in the way they are run and updated, we believe that registers are an obvious first choice to start reconstruction of trials programmes. Searching for unpublished material has not yet become standard practice in conducting Cochrane reviews (Van Driel 2009), and is currently variably reported (Ghersi 2010). The indexing and review of regulatory files was also a very laborious task. It took a WTE researcher three days to review the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulator's comments and gain a basic understanding of the content. Four additional days were needed to read and annotate the FDA zanamivir files and 28 days for reading and annotating the oseltamivir files and building the . We reasoned that if the yield were comparable, the Boolean strategy would have been faster. The yield of citations of the two strategies was the same for six of seven 'tracker' studies but use of a Boolean string was considerably faster (an average of 3 versus 14 hours) than the term-by-term strategy. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) submission citations took two hours to list in a TOC using a Boolean strategy. We adopted the Boolean search strategy to construct our TOC. Ultimately it is possible that a search with the trial numerals ('15670') may be sufficient to identify the vast majority of citations. To validate this method of searching further our methods should be repeated on other sets of regulatory documents. Once we had reconstructed the trial programmes we submitted the results to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Roche for their input. We received detailed feedback from both but as late as 2011 Roche's list of trials was incomplete. Despite the laboriousness of the methods, we believe we ended up with a far more comprehensive and less biased set of evidence than that available through the current system of journal-based publications. This shift in our data synthesis paradigm was made necessary by the numerous and documented discrepancies between regulatory and published evidence and by the sizeable risk of publication bias of the oseltamivir trial pro-gramme. The importance of reconstructing the trial programme by first generating a complete trial list was further reinforced upon discovering bias and oversights in regulators' handling of the trial programme. Regulators focus on a few mutually agreed \"pivotal\" trials whose data analyses are replicated by the FDA but not by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Both largely ignored trial M76001, the largest oseltamivir treatment trial conducted prior to initial registration of the drug (and still unpublished). While the manufacturer may not have offered it as a \"pivotal\" trial, far smaller and even ongoing studies were included in the evidence base to support Roche's year 1999 New Drug Application number 021087 (Treatment of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza infections in adults who have been symptomatic for no more than two days). The depth of the EMA scrutiny is harder to assess as we could find no reports of trial site visits or of data analysis replication, but we identified a pooled analysis of treatment ",

The main problem is not so much the appraisal following standard rules and possible synthesis of data (as when we review published information), but the reconstructions and logical threading of a trial programme generating huge amounts of data needing appraisal. Also the manufacturer's full regulatory submission, which may have even more information than a full clinical study report, remains confidential. Most of the essential data required are available in clinical study reports, together with masses of less important data, but as we have explained even in this case there may be important omissions, such as mislaid diary cards for follow-up. Manufacturers are under obligation to provide regulators with all data requested to enable them to reach a decision: in doing so they produce vast submissions. None of the authors (all experienced systematic reviewers) had any experience of reviewing regulatory information. Given the laborious and painstaking process we tried to identify a quicker and equally reliable way of reviewing regulatory information but could not find any obvious shortcuts. However, we be-lieve that providing a critical overview of a trial programme rather than minute dissection of each trial is necessary. This can be done by identifying the important topics in the trial programme (such as the effects of the drug on symptoms, infection, complications, transmission and well-being) and following them throughout the programme, knitting the evidence into a coherent narrative. This includes carrying out a high-level overview of the mode of action of the drug in different populations for different indications. Understanding any drug's mode of action is core to correct reporting of its strengths and limitations. In addition, a large part of the regulatory submission is made up of chemistry, microbiological, animal model pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies, which are important for shedding light on the trial programme but which seldom feature in systematic reviews. We are unsure as to whether this information could be considered as core information but an exhaustive review of a trial programme should include reviews dedicated to such topics. These methods were crucial in discovering major concerns in trial conduct and validity, including the lack of comparability between arms induced by subset analysis and by the randomisation-analysis fork, high positivity rate of influenza, high gastrointestinal events in the placebo arms, possibly active placebo content and possible procedural breaches several trials, which are concerning. Overall, the safest and more conservative option appears to carry out analyses on the basis of the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, in which units of randomisation and analysis are the same and many of the potential problems listed are either not present or minimised. Our novel methodology remains a work in progress.",

A request for a specific document is likely to be dealt with far more efficiently than a generic request for \"all documentation relating to oseltamivir\". This is one of the reasons why developing a TOC for any drug or family of drugs (no matter how time-consuming) is an absolute prerequisite for any serious attempt at reviewing regulatory evidence. This introduces another very difficult problem: how to handle huge quantities of structured information and the ethics of drawing conclusions from what is still a fragmentary (albeit sizeable) evidence base.",

The FDA refused to accept claims of oseltamivir's effects on influenza complications as \"false or misleading\" statements in promotional materials (FDA 2000f ). An FDA warning letter seems to imply, for example, that oseltamivir's mode of action is \"proposed\" or \"possibly\" [that proposed by the manufacturers] i.e. not certain (FDA 2000f). However, FDA reviewers appear to have missed important problems in Roche's clinical trials (such as the imbalance in the numbers of individuals classified as influenza-infected in oseltamivir treatment trials).

Also for the first time, all clinical study reports of trials in a manufacturer's programme (regardless of their relevance to the review) are available to readers without any restriction (apart from minimal redactions to protect anonymity further). The role of Roche and GSK in making this possible should be recognised, as well as that of the BMJ, which kept the issue in the public eye until it was resolved. The evidence we have presented and synthesised shows that both neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) in this review have symptom-relieving effects, especially for self reported outcomes. They appear to have symptom-relieving properties that make people with influenza-like illness and self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified pneumonia feel better by shortening symptom duration and reducing the frequency of symptoms such as cough. For oseltamivir, this effect perhaps extends to cardiac symptoms, despite the short duration of treatment (five days). We are unsure what to make of this finding but we think it deserves further investigation. The issue which triggered our change of evidence-seeking methods is partly resolved: no definitions of secondary illnesses were given anywhere in the clinical study reports (for example \"pneumonia\" was defined as \"pneumonia\" in the case report forms (Table 1) and diagnostic criteria were not given); clinical diagnosis in the absence of criteria and without X-ray has only a moderate chance of being correct. We could not decide the level of diagnostic ascertainment of diagnosis of pneumonia and other complications, as it is unclear from the clinical study reports. Definitions of pneumonia were not given and the algorithm for classification of an event as pneu-monia was not supplied. In oseltamivir trials, the case report form trigger for recording of adverse events and secondary illness was a question to the participant posed by the investigator. A typical phrasing is as follows: \"Secondary illness reminder: Has the patient reported any sinusitis, otitis, bronchitis, other chest infection or pneumonia since baseline?\" This was followed by a yes/no box to be ticked and an additional form was to be filled out by the investigator for collecting details on the secondary illness. A record of medications outside trial allocation was elicited in addition to the participant's diary card. The original and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms suggest diagnoses for all secondary illnesses and adverse events but there is no indication how the original and preferred terms were assigned. We therefore considered these outcomes to be \"self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified\" outcomes. For a subset of trials, secondary/intercurrent illness and adverse event data were collected on a single, one-page form. In our meta-analyses, we called this sub-analysis \"Trials which collected data on non-specific adverse events or secondary/intercurrent illness form\". For a different subset of trials, case report forms contained space to record diagnostic tests such as chest X-rays, tympanometry and sinus X-rays for all secondary illness but there was no reporting of such variables in the clinical study reports (Figure 12 ; Figure 13 ; Figure 14 ; Figure 15 ). In our meta-analyses, we called this sub-analysis \"Trials which collected data on specific 'Diagnosis of Secondary Illness' form\". None of the complications were defined as primary outcomes in any trial, which may explain the poverty of data definition.",

In addition, meta-analyses of these outcomes that lacked definitions were based on few events and therefore not robust. Caution is therefore urged in interpreting the meta-analysis result, which suggests that 100 patients (67 to 451) need to be treated with oseltamivir for one less self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified pneumonia. The same applies to the zanamivir treatment result, which suggests a reduced risk of self reported, investigator-mediated, unverified bronchitis in adults (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 36 to 155). The evidence suggested oseltamivir had a similar effect, although the result was non-significant. As stated above, there is no evidence that definitions of complications in either paediatric, elderly or adult trials were ever prepared and incorporated in the trials' design. Therefore, the reporting of cases of 'otitis media', 'pneumonia', 'sinusitis' or 'bronchitis' are of unclear significance and importance, making it impossible to attribute a cause and draw conclusions (FDA 2000d) . This is probably why the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oseltamivir package insert, since 17 November 2000, has consistently stated: \"serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. TAMIFLU has not been shown to prevent such complications.\" The original product label did not contain such a statement but on 14 April 2000, after oseltamivir was approved for sale in the United States, the FDA sent Roche an untitled letter about \"Misleading Efficacy Claims\" that the FDA had noted in Roche's promotional materials (FDA 2000a, PDF page 3). One of the statements that Roche made was: \"Tamiflu reduces incidence of secondary complications (i.e. bacterial infections) by 45%.\" The FDA commented: \"Further, you have claimed reductions in severity and incidence of secondary infections with Tamiflu that are misleading because they are not supported by substantial evidence\" (FDA 2000a, PDF page 3). We do not know how Roche responded to the FDA but in subsequently available Roche promotional material information, Roche's statements were consistent with the FDA's demands (Doshi 2009). There is uncertainty in the \"complications\" and \"secondary illnesses\" outcome definition therefore we carried out an analysis on the data from adult treatment trials on those complications classified as serious or those which led to study withdrawal. For os-eltamivir, there was no evidence that treatment affected such complications (risk difference (RD) 0.07%, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.44) (Analysis 1.20; Analysis 1.55). This outcome could not be assessed in oseltamivir prophylaxis due to an insufficient number of events. For zanamivir, there was no significant evidence of a treatment effect on such complications (RD -0.04%, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.24) (Analysis 3.7; Analysis 4.8). This outcome could not be assessed in children due to an insufficient number of events. Contrary to the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s oseltamivir 'Summary of Product Characteristics' states that oseltamivir significantly reduces the incidence of \"specified lower respiratory tract complications (mainly bronchitis) treated with antibiotics\" in individuals of 13 years of age and older. This claim is based on \"a pooled analysis of all influenza-positive adults and adolescents (N = 2413) enrolled into treatment studies\", of which 1063 were in the placebo group and 1350 were in the oseltamivirtreated population (EMA 2010) . This statement appears in the EMA files as early as 2001 (EMEA 2001). These exact denominators appear in the Kaiser 2003 meta-analysis. The design of the trials, as defined in the protocol with amendments, statistical analysis plan and case report forms, does not allow any further inferences. The effect on outcomes that were originally considered of secondary or tertiary importance (such as bronchitis and pneumonia) would have been clarified with better clinical definitions and investigations, as some of the serious adverse events were. These benefited from a paragraph-length narrative, which reported most of the salient features of the event.",

            "text": "Our previous decision to analyse the effects of oseltamivir and zanamivir on the ITT population has been confirmed for oseltamivir with the demonstration of the effect on antibody responses in participants in treatment trials, although no such effect is discernible for zanamivir. This effect leads to the introduction of selection bias with a significantly reduced probability of being diagnosed with influenza and an imbalance in the two arms if the intention-to-treat-influenza-infected (ITTI) population is analysed. The effect of oseltamivir on antibodies appears to be carried over to children with influenza-like illness. Its finding contradicts statements made by the manufacturer. The seeming incomparability between arms of the influenza-infected subpopulations in the oseltamivir trials raises the question of how an appropriate analysis should be conducted. If influenza-infected groups are comparable (as appears to be the case in zanamivir treatment trials) then an appropriate analysis strategy (based on Senn 2004) would be to determine first the effect of treatment in the ITT population. If there is evidence of a treatment effect, then treatment by infected status interaction could be tested. If there was evidence of an interaction, then estimates of treatment effect could be derived separately for the influenza-infected and noninfluenza-infected subpopulations. However, this analysis should be conducted on the ITT population using a single appropriate statistical model, obviating the need to conduct separate analysis on the influenza-infected subpopulation. Roche used geomet-ric mean titres indicating antibody responses in the ITTI population to support their statement that oseltamivir does not affect antibody responses (for example, in Table 16 and linked text of Module 1 of trial WV15799). However, the use of such measures can be misleading. What are required for such an analysis are data on how many ITT population participants responded by arm, at what level of antibody response and how many were tested. Such data could not be identified with certainty. A further effect of choosing a subpopulation analysis (ITTI in treatment trials and ITTIINAB (ITT influenza-infected index cases who had negative virology at baseline) in prophylaxis trials) as the primary analysis is the restriction of the generalisability of results. This is especially so in the case of design flaws (for example, in the case of the postexposure prophylaxis trial WV15799, where all index cases were not treated and around 55% of participants were dropped from the ITTIINAB analysis). In this cluster-trial design households should be included as random-effects in the analysis to take account of within-household correlations. A significant but slight reduction of the proportion with serum antibody (mostly haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody) titre rise by four-fold or more among those who were tested was shown in this review. This was consistent with the evidence from animal tests using a sub-clinical dose of oseltamivir in influenza A/ H1N1-infected mice (Takahashi 2010 ). Takahashi 2010 reported a non-significant slight reduction of haemagglutinin (HA) specific IgG antibody in serum and spleen, while they reported about an 80% significant reduction of HA specific secretory IgA antibody (s-IgA Ab) in nasal wash and bronchoalveolar fluids (BALF) on day 12. From this evidence, they warned that the risk of re-infection may increase in patients showing a low mucosal IgA antibody response following oseltamivir administration. These experiments were done because they had the unexpected finding that paediatric influenza patients treated orally with oseltamivir for five days had significantly low levels (about 60% reduction on day five) of antiinfluenza S-IgA nasopharyngeal fluids compared to levels in patients not treated with oseltamivir (Sawabuchi 2009). Their findings are consistent with our findings that serum HA inhibition (HAI) antibody response was decreased by oseltamivir administration, though s-IgG Ab could not be analysed in our study because the data were not reported in the clinical study reports (Sawabuchi 2009; Takahashi 2010). These findings are also consistent with the evidence on the mode of action of oseltamivir from animal models (Module 2 of Mendel 1998; WV15670; WV15671) and from viral challenge, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in humans ). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3 ), were completely suppressed by oseltamivir administered 28 hours after the experimental inoculation of influenza virus, while the reduction of viral titre in nasal lavages was partial ).",

            "text": "There is decisive evidence that administration of oseltamivir in an-imals challenged by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that lacks a neuraminidase gene showed a symptom-relieving effect (decreased weight loss) and inhibition of viral clearance . These effects were accompanied by a decreased CD+8 T cell surface sialoglycosphingolipid GM1 level, which is regulated by the endogenous sialidase/neuraminidase in response to viral challenge along with suppression of cytokine expression . They are consistent with those findings from the pharmaceutical company and their investigators. The findings of the study by Moore 2007 suggest a risk of infection and exacerbation of infection by pathogens other than influenza virus in spite of the apparent reduction of symptoms from infection. Sufficient plasma concentration of oseltamivir carboxylate from orally administered oseltamivir phosphate may act directly on the host endogenous neuraminidase to reduce (or suppress) the immune response even at the dose of 20 mg twice a day for five days. However, the bioavailability of inhaled zanamivir seems to be very broad: about 10% to 70%, as estimated by the area under the curve (AUC) data from the inhalation and intravenous study from the Japanese Summary Basis of Approval (JSBA). The difference in peak concentration (Cmax) was much larger (6 to 37-fold). This means that inhaled zanamivir could reach a high enough concentration to reduce the immune response, if it is administered at a high dose or a for long period, or if the patient is very susceptible. In fact, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using healthy volunteers to investigate the effect of zanamivir treatment (20 mg/day for 14 days) on the humoral immune response to influenza vaccine showed that the zanamivir group responded with significantly lower antibody titres to the H1N1 (Cox 2001) . Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and other chemokines, were almost completely suppressed in the viral challenge randomised controlled trial (RCT) using a very high dose (600 mg) of intravenous zanamivir before inoculation of the influenza virus in human adults (Fritz 1999). These findings all suggest that the low immune response, with a low level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, induced by the action of oseltamivir carboxylate may reduce the symptoms of influenza irrespective of an inhibition of influenza virus replication, which is widely believed to be the main mode of action of NIs. In addition, the potential hypothermic or antipyretic effect of oseltamivir (but not zanamivir) as a central nervous system depressant may also contribute to the apparent reduction of host symptoms (Ono 2008; Ono 2013 ). Zanamivir had no effect on pneumonia symptoms in treatment trials, even when the diagnosis was supported by a chest X-ray; nor did it affect antibody responses, but it did affect bronchitis. We think that this shows an undeniable symptom-relieving effect of both drugs, which also applies to more severe, if undefined, syndromes. Both drugs relieve influenza-like illness symptoms by around 0.6 to 0.7 of a day, although this is first relief and not necessarily complete relief. In the case of oseltamivir, the mix up with the follow-up cards does not allow us to draw any conclusions on a possible length of the duration of symptom relief. Also of note is the fact that this important information came to light from the FDA reports and not from the clinical study reports of the relevant trials (WV15670; WV15671). This points to the incomplete nature of reporting in the clinical study reports and the important role of Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) regulatory information.",

Both subgroups showed strong evidence of treatment effect of 0.5 to 0.7 days reduction in time to first alleviation of symptoms. This strongly supports our hypothesis that these drugs do not have an influenza-specific effect. Oseltamivir relieves symptoms in otherwise healthy children, but no effect was noted with zanamivir, which may be due to the limited power of the two eligible trials with just over 700 children in total. However, oseltamivir does not have any effect on asthmatic children with influenza-like illness, a population which should benefit most from its use. One explanation for this finding is in the nature of the young asthmatic population, which is well cared for and used to regular powerful medications and close follow-up. The incremental benefit of oseltamivir is thus likely to be undetectable in such a population. An alternative explanation could be the higher susceptibility of the immune system to suppression by oseltamivir carboxylate in asthmatic children compared with those in the placebo group. The finding that oseltamivir administered to asthmatic children reduces symptoms faster than in placebo recipients at the beginning of the study, but during the off-treatment period more recovered later than those administered placebo, gives some support to this explanation. There is no evidence of an effect of oseltamivir on hospitalisations.",

The oseltamivir trials did not detect any influenza-related deaths, reflecting the relatively benign nature of influenza in the study populations. The zanamivir trials detected eight deaths, of which only two were likely to be due to influenza and both occurred in the intervention arms. All the trials were likely to be underpowered to detect differential effects on mortality, but the absence of deaths in placebo recipients again underlines the benign nature of influenza. In fact mortality in Japan during the 2009A/H1N1 influenza outbreak was 198 among about 20 million influenza patients (one in 100,000 infected). Early deterioration leading to death was observed more frequently in oseltamivir compared to zanamivir or no antivirals recipients . Overall the two drugs have similar benefits but quite different toxicity profiles. On average, for every 28 (14 to 112) adults treated with oseltamivir there will be one more report of nausea and for every 22 (14 to 42) adults and 19 (10 to 57) children there will be one more report of vomiting. Oseltamivir seems to have an apparent protective effect on diarrhoea, contrary to the other evidence of gastrointestinal disturbance. This finding might be as an effect of a placebo containing dehydrocholic acid or it might be one of the results of the influenza-like illness symptom-relieving effects (similar to relief of tachycardia and palpitation). The other apparent gastrointestinal events, such as nausea and vomiting, may be the results of central nervous disorders indicated by \"only day 1 increase of vomiting\" in treatment trials in children.",

Added to other more frequently reported but not significantly different events (such as depression and confusion) this gave a large effect and a relatively small number needed to treat to harm of 94 (36 to 1538).

It is possible that influenza-like illness and influenza symptoms masked the harms in those who were already symptomatic and therefore recruited in the treatment trials (and influenza-type symptoms were excluded as adverse events to be reported). The reporting issue of compliharms may have helped to mask such events. Alternatively, it could be that these events are rare in the populations studied and that there was insufficient power to detect an association. The CI was wide (0.43 to 2.03) and does not rule out a doubling in risk due to treatment -as was found in the prophylaxis trials. It is also possible that the risk of psychiatric harm increases with increasing dose (as the data from trials WV15670 and WV15671 suggest) and increasing duration of treatment (as the prophylaxis trials suggest). Toovey 2008 assessed the issue and failed to find an association between neurological and psychiatric adverse events and oseltamivir exposure. The outcomes studied were not based on the a priori definition of psychiatric adverse events as defined in the clinical study reports. The definition was constructed post hoc based on a selected group of adverse events taken from the psychiatric, neurological and injury body systems in the reports. The issues are described fully in Jones 2012 and Toovey's response is in Toovey 2012.

In one prospective study of several thousand children with influenza carried out to test the hypothesis of a causal relation between oseltamivir and neuropsychiatric events, abnormal behaviour was observed more frequently in oseltamivir recipient children than in controls (RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.83).

Reanalysis of this study population, focusing on delirium and unconsciousness, also showed a significant association between oseltamivir and neuropsychiatric events, especially in the very early phase of the illness within a day of commencement of fever (Fuiita 2011).

            "text": "Animal toxicity study results firmly support the effect of oseltamivir on the central nervous system. One of these is the hypothermic effect of oseltamivir (but not zanamivir) administered orally, intraperitoneally (Ono 2008; Ono 2013 ) and intracerebroventricularly (Ono 2013 ). The other is that intra-duodenal or intravenous administration of oseltamivir to mature rats induced respiratory arrest shortly followed by cardiac arrest. These studies clearly show central depressant effects of oseltamivir (Kimura 2012). Moreover in the post-marketing toxicology phase studies by Roche, many symptoms that the manufacturer considered \"item-related\" were observed: alterations in respiration including decreased respiratory rate/gasping and altered mucous membrane/ skin colour (pale) prior to death. Although the manufacturer denied the causality (Freichel 2009), symptoms at two hours after administration that showed dose-related increase were lack of olfactory orientation, lack of cliff aversion and low or very low arousal. Twenty-four of 52 pups that did not exhibit cliff aversion were later found dead. Fourteen of 17 animals with low or very low arousal died thereafter. These findings are consistent with the clinically observed psychiatric symptoms in the RCTs and postmarketing spontaneous reports. Zanamivir was well tolerated. However, a potentially active placebo may have masked the occurrence of bronchospasm in zanamivir trials. Treatment trials were mostly under-recruited and often their results pooled post hoc in two or even three trials, and yet they showed very high influenza positivity rates. One possible explanation for this lies in the intensive surveillance carried out in the predefined trial centre areas and the restricted time span of recruitment during high likelihood of positivity periods. This may be why many centres with low levels of recruitment are listed in the clinical study reports; this limits the generalisability of the results to everyday life. In a primary or secondary prophylaxis indication the postulated central effect of oseltamivir is confined to suppressing symptoms, as infection was not prevented even when oseltamivir was administered prior to the inoculation of influenza virus both in animals (Mendel 1998) and in humans ) and the prophylaxis trials. However, the central problem remains the incompatibility of the two contrasting claims of its activity against antibody production. If, as reported in many documents, oseltamivir does not interfere with antibody production (see, for example, FDA 2011a; Roche Investigators' Guide), how is it possible that oseltamivir prevents cases of influenza when part of the definition of prevented cases in oseltamivir trials was based on absence of antibody response?",

            "text": "The apparent ability of oseltamivir to interfere with antibody response calls into question the mode of action of the drug and puts in doubt the proposed effects of oseltamivir. One possibility in treatment trials is that oseltamivir administration, by interfering with antibody production, has the effect of selecting the strongest antibody responders in the ITTI subpopulation. These individuals are classified as influenza cases and are included in the oseltamivir arm of the ITTI population. This selected subpopulation probably represents the healthiest or those least likely to experience complications. An alternative consequence could be that interference with antibody production in the oseltamivir arm led to active arm participants being more likely to develop complications due to impaired immune function. Evidence from prophylaxis and secondary prophylaxis trials suggests that in addition to the apparent similar mode of action as in the treatment studies, suppression of viral shedding in nasal swab may be of importance. In the former, participants who become positive (i.e. who are subsequently classified as cases of influenza) in the oseltamivir arms are the few who mount a strong response despite oseltamivir interference. The remainder (who are significantly more than in the placebo arm) are classified as prevented or avoided cases. However, as prophylaxis clinical study reports do not report antibody responses and viral isolate results for the ITT populations either, it is impossible to tell whether this proposed mode of action fits all the evidence. The effect of oseltamivir on nasal shedding is consistent with the proposed mode of action of NIs in preventing the virus from leaving the host respiratory epithelial cells, which are covered by a mucous layer. Compared with the rather small reduction of symptoms of influenza-like illness and reduction in antibody rise (up to 10%) by both oseltamivir and zanamivir, the extent of the reduction of symptomatic influenza is almost half. This may be due to reduction of influenza viruses in the nasal swab sample.",

This is important as the results of trial WV15799 formed part of the WHO3 rationale for use of the drug to interrupt transmission from person to person and allow time before the arrival of vaccines in the event of a pandemic furnishing a seemingly powerful rationale for stockpiling oseltamivir. This shows the importance of availability of full clinical study reports, something the WHO did not have. Antibody suppression seems stronger for oseltamivir than zanamivir, probably due to the difference in bioavailability. It may be that evidence of other effects, such as hyperglycaemia and renal impairment (though significance was marginal) in the prophylaxis trials may be due to inhibition of the host's endogenous neuraminidase, which impairs the cell function of various organs (Hama 2008) . Overall, the significance of oseltamivir for nasal shedding is unclear but problems with sampling and culture undermine any claims as to its secondary prophylactic properties, as the FDA made clear in its response (FDA 1999c).",

            "text": "The dose-response increase in psychiatric events in the \"pivotal\" oseltamivir treatment trials and the increase in vomiting only on day one in treatment trials in children may be due to the sudden onset of the central action of unchanged oseltamivir (Hama 2008 ). Brain concentration of unchanged oseltamivir increases during the early phase of influenza in juvenile animals (Freichel 2009), due to a reduced or low function of p-glycoprotein, a major transporter of oseltamivir at the blood-brain barrier (Hama 2008 ; Kimura 2012). The likely centrally mediated mode of action of oseltamivir is supported by the finding of adverse events in healthy people in prophylaxis trials. However, these effects may also be derived from a delayed action associated with host endogenous neuraminidase inhibition by oseltamivir (Hama 2008) , because this appeared after more than a week's exposure the drug and lasted for more than two weeks. Other effects, such as pain in the limbs, hyperglycaemia or diabetic events, reduction of antibody rise and reduction of cytokine induction, may also be due to the suppression of the host's endogenous neuraminidase by oseltamivir . Pain in the limbs and metabolic control events (mainly hyperglycaemia) were in excess in the oseltamivir arms, but we did not carry out a formal meta-analysis, as they were not prespecified in our analysis plan and the number of events was below 10 for metabolic events. Statements made about the capacity of oseltamivir to interrupt viral transmission and reduce complications are not supported by any data we have been able to access. We have not reviewed other NIs, such as laninamivir and peramivir, or other antivirals, such as the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine), or antipyretic/anti-inflammatory agents either. Laninamivir and peramivir may be more potent as NIs, because their bioavailability is far higher than zanamivir and may affect the host's endogenous neuraminidase. Adamantanes are well known centrally active agents and may be more harmful than oseltamivir and zanamivir. Anti-inflammatory antipyretics (except paracetamol) may be more toxic than NIs (Hama 2008) . Hence, the other NIs, adamantanes and anti-inflammatory antipyretics may not be alternatives to oseltamivir and zanamivir.",

The effect of oseltamivir on the gastrointestinal tract appears to be notable, although a definitive statement will only be possible once the mode of action and dosage of dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate and dehydrocholic acid have been clarified. The high percentage of influenza infections appears to be in contrast with the need to pool or delay several trials and the small recruitment size of others because of a lack of influenza circulation. In the case of post-exposure prophylaxis trials, the selection of the infected population has the effect of excluding from the analysis large percentages (in some cases over 50%) of participants. This brings the generalisability of the results of these trials into question. Much has been made in the trial programmes of viral nasal voidance as a marker of effect. However, its measurement was unreliable in treatment trials as this verbatim quote from the FDA review shows: \"Duration of viral shedding was measured from treatment initiation to the time of the first negative virus culture with no subsequent positive cultures. Upon reviewing a list of viral shedding patterns provided by the applicant on 8/16/99, two problems emerged: (1) the pattern of virus shedding was fluctuating in at least 33 subjects (i.e. pos-neg-pos-neg, with or without a subsequent negative result). (2) In at least 100 subjects, the last virus shedding sample was the first negative sample in sequence, meaning there was not a subsequent negative confirmation. Given the fluctuating pattern of virus shedding, to estimate the duration of viral shedding based on the occurrence of a single first negative data poses a high level of uncertainty\" (FDA 1999c). In all programmes, the effect on complications was based on unclear and potentially unreliable definitions, often at the discretion of local clinicians and confirmation (e.g. radiological confirmation of pneumonia) was not consistently reported when it did occur.",

Randomisation lists appeared to be of two types. The first was a pre-randomisation list of random codes with which participants' IDs cannot be matched with the participant IDs used within other sections of the clinical study report. The second was a post hoc randomisation list to which individual participants can be matched but the original generated codes are not shown. In both cases the truly random generation of the sequence could not be properly assessed because either the original codes are not provided or original codes cannot be matched to patients. We have created methods and procedures to address the risk of reporting bias that we identified in published trials, but remain uncertain about the success of these new methods. Hernan and Lipsitch evaluated lower respiratory tract complications and found a statistically significant, but smaller, reduction in the risk of these complications. Hernan and Lipsitch omitted evaluating the Kaiser paper's conclusion that oseltamivir reduced the risk of hospitalisation. They wrote, \"it was not possible to assess the potential benefit for highrisk participants who are hospitalised, because the sample size of most studies was too small to consider hospitalisation as an outcome.\" Hernan and Lipsitch do not elaborate on or highlight their apparent methodological disagreement with the Kaiser 2003 analysis and it is not reflected in the news article published on the Harvard website entitled \"Oseltamivir effect on complications confirmed by reanalysis\" (http://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/NewsEvents/ Oseltamivir-reanalysis). In fact, Hernan and Lipsitch did not confirm one of the key conclusions of the Kaiser paper Review Team 2011). The approach Hernan and Lipsitch took in analysing data was insufficient to provide a credible, independent check on validity and reinforces the importance of detailed, critical assessment of entire trial programmes, with access to full-length study reports. Our analysis questions the coherence between the evidence and the proposed mode of action of oseltamivir. The Ebell 2012 review concluded that there was \"no evidence that oseltamivir reduces the likelihood of hospitalisation, pneumonia or the combined outcome of pneumonia, otitis media and sinusitis in the ITT population\". This conclusion was based on Module 1 of the 10 Kaiser trials plus WV16277. These are the same 11 trials as Hernan 2011.",

Priority could perhaps be given to first drugs of a new family, drugs considered to be innovative or those that are likely to have a big market impact. Such reviews should be publicly funded and be independent from both regulators and manufacturers. Researchers who conduct these 'high scrutiny' reviews need to be free of recent ties to either government or the pharmaceutical industry.

This virus, previously associated with avian influenza, has apparently crossed species and resulted in a pathogenic infection in man. The vast majority of influenza infections occurring in Hong Kong at the time of the study were of the non-virulent strain types influenza A/H1N1, H3/N2 or influenza B. However, it was considered that in view of the apparent virulence of the A/H5N1 strain type, participants enrolled into this study, which was placebo-controlled, might be placed at undue risk. This risk was specific to Hong Kong, as this strain type has not so far been identified outside of this region 2. The influenza A/H5N1 virus type is known to be sensitive to amantadine. Throat swabs were taken from all participants entered into the trial prior to the first dose of study drug. In the Hong Kong region, a rapid diagnostic technique (the polymerase chain reaction, PCR) was used to test the swab eluates for the presence or absence of influenza A/H5N1. If any participant was found to be harbouring this strain type, they were to be withdrawn from the study without breaking the blind and offered amantadine at the discretion of the investigator and if the participants condition merited such intervention 3. (16 February 1998) revised the analyses and definition of secondary and tertiary parameters in the study. Following an experiment to assess the use of a standardised protocol for quantitative viral culture, significant variability was detected between the 2 virology laboratories with respect to these assays. Further work continued in order to elucidate the mechanisms of this variability and to further validate the methods. However, due to the lengthy period of time required to complete this work, virus titre was removed as a secondary parameter in this study and the information analysed postdatabase close. The major virology parameter in these studies thus became the duration of virus shedding following inclusion into the trial. It was also believed that peak virus titre might have occurred prior to baseline for a significant number of participants entering the trial and hence this particular parameter was not analysed Study period: December 1997 to April 1998",

Originally, symptoms, signs and common sequelae of influenza were to be reported as adverse events. After this protocol amendment, such symptoms, signs and common complications were excluded from reporting as adverse events, unless they fulfilled the criteria for reporting as serious adverse events or the criteria for secondary illness 2. Protocol WV15876 amendment B also added a requirement for male participants whose partners were of childbearing potential to use effective contraception during the study and for 3 months after completing the study, to follow Roche current standard operating procedures 3. Protocol WV15819 amendment D and protocol WV15876 amendment C made changes to the secondary efficacy parameters. The secondary efficacy parameter reflecting the antiviral effect of treatment was changed from the duration of viral shedding to the proportion of participants shedding virus on day 3. This change was made because the intermittent sampling schedule used in the study meant that the true duration of viral shedding could not be assessed exactly, whereas the proportion of participants shedding virus could be determined. The incidence of secondary illnesses requiring antibiotics was included as a new secondary endpoint and the secondary illnesses were defined as sinusitis, LRTI, otitis media, bronchitis and pneumonia. The method of analysis of the proportion of participants shedding virus and for the proportion of participants with predefined secondary illnesses (Fisher's 2-tailed exact test) was added to the statistical methods.

For all time-to-event analyses, time zero was defined as coinciding with the initiation of treatment. For all endpoints defined in this section that involve 'alleviation' of symptoms, alleviation occurred at the start of the 24-hour period in which the symptom was less than or equal to 1 (mild) and remained less than or equal to 1 for at least 24 hours Primary outcome:",

The efficacy parameter to reflect the duration of illness was the length of time until alleviation of all symptoms. This was calculated from Time 0 (study drug initiation) to the length of time over which the area under the curve (AUC) for symptoms was to be calculated. Participants withdrawing prior to alleviation of symptoms were censored at last assessment 2. The efficacy parameter to reflect the extent and severity of illness was the AUC for symptoms. This was calculated from Time 0 (study drug initiation) to the time at which all symptoms were alleviated. Scores were calculated twice daily by totaling the separate symptoms that form the symptom scale. The AUC of these scores was then calculated for each patient using the trapezoidal rule. The baseline for each symptom was defined as the assessment prior to first study drug intake even though this might be before Time 0 3.

Clinical study reports: Detailed reports of a clinical trial usually submitted to regulators following a prescribed ICH format. Roche's follow a modular structure (see Appendix 11) . Reports can be several hundred pages long and contain details of the planned design, conduct (protocol), analysis (reporting analysis plan or RAP) and results of the trial. Compliharm: Term describing events defined as either complications or harms according to ambiguous criteria that appeared to include time of analysis (with times either unspecified or inconsistent among trials) and whether participants were infected (by influenza) or not. In oseltamivir treatment trials some potential harms or complications could both be caused by medication or influenza infection (e.g. vomiting), hence our classification as a compliharms. Time lock: Date (12 April 2011) after which no documentation would be reviewed in the January 2012 version of the review. A cutoff was made necessary by the sheer scale of our data holdings. We were initially funded to review the full clinical study reports of the 10 treatment trials included in the Kaiser et al paper. We were able to access the 10 Module 1s and regulatory comments (approximately 6000 pages in total). As the funder-stipulated deadline to producing our review progressively shortened and our understanding of the issues evolved we received notification that while the balance of the 10 study reports were unlikely to be accessible by our deadline, we would receive substantial quantities of regulatory documents from the EMA in four tranches. When we held our second face to face meeting in April 2011 we had just received our first tranche of clinical study reports consisting of just over 10 thousand pages, bringing our total holdings to 16,000 pages. We decided that we did not have the resources to review any further documentation within our current funding and imposed a data time lock. Any documentation received after this date would be reviewed if and when we had more resources. The balance of documents (a further 14,000 pages) are included in this review. TOC: Table of content of regulatory reviews and comments on industry submissions. Our TOC indicates which trial is cited in which document on which page how many times. TOCE: Annotated version of the TOC. Comments and annotation are preliminary and form the basis for the weaving of the important aspects into the review narrative. (See also Table 2; Table 3; Table 4 ; Table 5 ). Trial ID: Means of identifying a trial. Usually made up of letters and numbers (WV 15799). At times the ID bears a letter suffix indicating the last version of the protocol followed in the trial (e.g. WV 15799H, i.e. trial carried out following amendment H). Regulatory information: Term comprising clinical study reports (data) and regulatory comments and reviews. Modules: Basic structure of Roche's trial reports see (Appendix 11). Today, the term 'Modules' refers to the components of a regulatory submission, as set by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) (ICH 2011). Clinical study reports are just one 'Module' of a regulatory submission. accessible on the web. This reported a clinical trial programme of over 60 studies. Searching for an unpublished and hitherto unseen data set requires constructing a reasonably accurate list of all studies of the drug in question. The Roche Investigator's Brochure did not mention some studies we were aware of, and reinforced an idea that we had become clear was essential: the need to develop our own list of trials, because a single, authoritative, up-to-date and complete list of all clinical trials conducted on humans using for both drugs did not seem to exist. When thinking about our next update we decided not to use publications because the majority of treatment trial evidence for Tamiflu remained unpublished, because we had found some discrepancies between CSRs and published equivalents and, mostly, because clinical study reports were so much more detailed and comprehensive than short journal articles, enabling a more thorough critical analysis of the trials. We also decided to expand the scope of A047 by including evidence relating to people of all ages except for immunesuppressed individuals. This, de facto, amounted to the creation of one new review (A159) with a new protocol subsuming A047 and A046. The protocol for A159 was publicly posted in December 2010.",

In 2009-11, company websites did not and still do not have extensive lists of trials with downloadable clinical study reports. Most people had never heard of clinical study reports before media coverage of our efforts. We decided to construct our list by using multiple cross-referencing methods. We constructed a list beginning with clinical trials identified from previous review updates. To this end, we added additional trials in humans from multiple sources, including manufacturer submissions to regulators, drug product information sheets, previous published reviews, Health Technology Assessment (HTA) documents and public and manufacturers' registers (Burch 2009; Cooper 2003; Jefferson 2006; Tappenden 2009; Turner 2003) , such as www.ClinicalTrials.gov and www.roche-trials.com. Regulatory documents also aided the identification of unknown trials. Finally, we also conducted traditional database and grey literature searches (Appendix 5) to identify previously unknown trials. One of the first things we learned was that to ensure the list did not include duplicate entries, we had to assign to each trial a Unique Trial ID. 'Author' is not a good choice of Unique Trial ID, as different authors can be present across different versions of the same trial (that is, the authors of clinical study reports can be different from publications arising from the same clinical trial). Nor are any other details connected to publications a good option for Unique Trial ID because not all studies are published. Some trials will have company-specific codes and some will have public clinical trial registry numbers, or both, or neither. To simplify recognition and terminology we used the manufacturer protocol ID as our Unique Trial ID. Our list was only going to be useful if it had sufficient details to enable us to decide whether it met our inclusion criteria. For each Unique Trial ID, we gathered the following details. 19 . How identified (to record how the trial was discovered) 20. Notes Once we had as complete a list of trials as possible, we contacted manufacturers and sent them our draft list, asking them to check the accuracy and completeness of our list. Roche, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and BioCryst all did so, and in doing so we learned of hitherto unknown trials.",

            "text": "Occasionally, the existence of further unknown trials was detected weeks and months after we thought we had a 'complete' list. This may be inevitable given that trial identification often takes place in unpredictable ways, for example while reading through detailed regulatory reports. We engaged in prolonged correspondence with Roche and GSK and requested a series of regulatory documents under freedom of information policies from both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA). No substantial comments were made by Roche on the protocol of 159 which has been publicly available in one form or another since December 2010. Specifically, we applied to EMA under their new release policy for 26 clinical study reports in their holdings relating to oseltamivir and GSK's zanamivir. The result was the delivery (starting in late March 2011) of 16 clinical study reports, all containing Modules 1 and 2 plus one complete report for oseltamivir (trial WP16263). (See table 1 in Doshi 2012b). None were available for zanamivir, as the EMA had not played a part in its market authorisation. These formed the basis for the 2012 version of A159. At the date of completion of data searches for A159 (12 April 2011), Roche had only provided us with partial clinical study reports despite five requests for full clinical study reports. The material obtained from Roche included the first section (or so-called 'Module 1' or 'Core Report') of a full clinical study report, each of which contain four to five Modules (Appendix 11) for the 10 oseltamivir treatment trials included in the Kaiser 2003 meta-analysis. Not contained in the provided Module 1s are trial protocols with the list of amendments and original reporting analysis plans. These Module 1s comprise 3195 pages. Roche had not made available any further material and indicated it did not intend to answer our requests for clarification on aspects of trials and for availability of the missing parts of complete clinical study reports. In addition we had a 53-page report in English of the treatment trial ML16369, sponsored by Shanghai Roche Pharmaceutical Ltd. Regardless of success with our requests to obtain full clinical study reports, we decided to update our review with available material and subsequently update it as and when additional data became available. Our searches of publication databases did not add any significant information. Following a change of policy at the EMA prompted by similar efforts of the Nordic Cochrane Centre (Gotzsche 2011), we received an additional eight clinical study reports (10,737 pages) in response to a freedom of information request. An additional 14,700 pages of further clinical study reports and 33 pages of regulators' comments arrived after our search deadline. All of the materials received from the EMA are related to oseltamivir. The EMA has no access to information for zanamivir, as it is a nationally authorised product in Europe (correspondence with Xavier Luria, 23 March 2011 and David Mackay 20 July 2011). At present we hold all Module 1s and 2 of oseltamivir trials we have requested. From GSK we have received the promise of individual patient data. Many of the clinical study reports used in this review were obtained via freedom of information requests. We still await an FDA decision regarding similar requests sent to FDA in January 2011. We were able to download 2673 pages of Summary Basis for Approval (SBA) documents from the FDA website, 31 from EMA and 508 pages of Japanese SBA. We indexed the content and then constructed an extended table of contents, giving a summary of each file, thereby facilitating navigation of these complex documents. Once the table of contents had been constructed, we postulated that given the huge work involved in reviewing lots of regulatory files, including clinical study reports, we needed new instruments to indicate which parts were more important than others, thus focusing our efforts. We experimented with a variety of methods reported in the earlier version of the review. We have now devised and used what for us is a satisfactory instrument for critically assessing clinical study reports in their entirety. We intend publishing this separately. The EMA releases, coupled with documents from the FDA SBA for both drugs, formed the basis for the version of A159 that we eventually published in January 2012. The review reported our efforts to get to the bottom of the issue of the effects of NIs by appraising evidence from unpublished clinical study reports (see Glossary (Appendix 1) and regulatory documents containing comments and reviews. We called the body of clinical studies and regulatory comments 'regulatory information' as all of these documents are either created for or by regulators. To our knowledge this was the first Cochrane review ever conducted on the basis of regulatory documents only. Due to funding timelines and the sizeable amount of regulatory information already available to us we decided to review material available as at 12 April 2011. This meant reviewing FDA SBA material and core reports (Module 1s) in our possession from EMA data releases received by this time.",

For example, scanning of titles and abstracts was done in double, but selection of studies for inclusion from the list constructed during our search was done in quadruple with disagreements resolved by discussion. For many studies we only had titles and in some cases a very brief description of content, thus we assigned three categories to our trials: 1. definitely included; 2. definitely excluded; and 3. trials for which we needed further information.",

            "text": "We excluded studies definitely not meeting the inclusion criteria on the basis of the available information (e.g. the title described the trial as a pharmacokinetic study). Where appropriate we requested further information from the trials' sponsor, usually copies of the clinical study reports (minus participant identification) for each trial that was definitely included or for which we needed further information. We did not contact first/corresponding authors of published versions of the trials on the basis of our experience with the 2009 review. Data extraction and management reflected the lack of established methods for reviewing regulatory material. We subdivided the extraction, appraisal and analysis of the data into a two-stage exercise, including studies in the analysis phase only if we judged their reports reliable and complete. To help structure the information we used CONSORT statement-based extraction forms aimed at assembling a concise version of the clinical study reports, which included all important methods as well as defined and extracted all relevant outcomes. We colour-coded the original text to flag up uncertainty or lack of clarity or need for more information from other (then inaccessible) parts of the clinical study report. During this process we excluded all six peramivir trials as we were informed by the manufacturers that no clinical study reports would be available.The 2012 A159 review was based on 15 oseltamivir clinical study core reports and 10 very brief zanamivir study reports. The former came from EMA, while the latter had been part of a GSK submission to the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) which the BMJ had passed onto us together with the SBA material. Our 2010 protocol for A159 was not very detailed on how we would handle this mass of information for the simple reason that no one had ever done it before. We quite literally were learning as we were going along and our understanding of the structure and content of clinical study reports evolved. We created and tested five post-protocol hypotheses (see Appendix 10) , which had originated from the findings in the reports. The best example was our finding of an unnaturally high (up to 80%) influenza positivity rate in treatment trials, which in some cases had been pooled because of lack of viral circulation. We hypothesised that screening for influenza positivity had been carried out prior to enrolment of people with influenza-like illness. This was not borne out by the evidence available to us. We know now that a far simpler explanation is more likely: careful selection of the time period for trial participant enrolment based on when surveillance data suggested high influenza activity led to the recruitment of small numbers of participants from each of many centres with a high likelihood of influenza positivity, but at the time we had limited information available. The 201 2 A159 review analyses were based on the ITT population, which we had found to be the only reliable analysis unit as oseltamivir appeared to have an effect on antibody production in people with influenza, leading to an imbalance in numbers of subjects in the influenza-infected (so-called ITTI) sub-population. This in effect introduced confounding in what otherwise should have been welldesigned double-blind trials. The only effect that was clearly identifiable was a modest shortening of influenza-like illness symptoms by less than a day. This led us to believe that oseltamivir had an aspecific powerful effect on symptoms not mediated by any action on influenza viruses but possibly via an anti-inflammatory mechanism. The trials had been clearly designed with a commercial focus in mind and some of the claims made by the manufacturer (especially on the effect on interruption of transmission and on pneumonia) were not supported by the evidence in our possession. 2012 to the present day Soon after the publication of the review, the BMJ agreed to publish our correspondence with Roche, GSK, EMA, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO, recording our attempts at retrieving the full reports without any conditions attached and to understand the basis for promotion of the drugs (especially oseltamivir) by public health bodies. Before receiving the full reports, we resumed reviewing the remainder of the material we had received in 2011. This mainly consisted of Module 2s (Roche terminology for pre-study documents). Module 2s contained the information originally denied to us by Roche: study protocols with their amendments, randomisation lists, blank case report forms (CRFs), certificates of analysis describing appearance and content of active and control capsules and, at times, statistical analysis plans (SAPs). CRFs are containers for the rawest form of recorded data at the individual participant level. We had no tools for reviewing and synthesising this information, so again we had to create our own. The instrument is made up of three parts each with a separate function. In the first part there is a template for a brief summary description of the trial. The format fits into the RevMan Characteristics of Included Studies (CIST) table and is mainly descriptive. The second part is the appraisal of the trial following the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' format. The third part reconstructs the trial timeline and provides a checklist and position in the document of the various elements such as protocol, protocol amendments and study period with dates. The last part aims to check the internal consistency and coherence of each element (such as numbers screened, numbers randomised, interventions, comparators) across all the different documents, starting from the earliest available version of the protocol. The form also contains suggestions on where to look for the information. This is based on our experience gained in this review and in a descriptive review of 78 clinical study reports of 14 different drugs and biologicals (Doshi 2013). While designing the tool we also asked ourselves whether access to Module 2 information (and later the full study reports) changed our perception of the trial and specifically our 'Risk of bias' assessment. We found that access to what are supposed to be full study reports should provide clarity and remove the rationale for 'unclear' risk of bias judgements and ideally remove the concept of risk leaving just 'bias', at least for certain study design elements such as attrition bias. Either a design element introduces bias or it does not. In the case of the 15 full oseltamivir clinical study reports we reviewed when constructing our tool, only one contained a protocol which predated the beginning of participant enrolment, only two had statistical analysis plans that clearly predated participants' enrolment and three had clearly dated protocol amendments. No clinical study report reported a clear date of unblinding. During the latter part of 2013, we received from the manufacturers tens of thousands of pages of full clinical study reports for both published papers, no complete clinical study reports were publicly available. Therefore, one review author (RH) asked the JMHLW on 29 July 2010 to disclose all documents reporting the evidence base for the approval of oseltamivir for these indications. The JMHLW sent RH a letter of refusal dated 2 September 2010, with the explanation \"because the disclosure of such documents might hurt the right, position or other fair benefit in the competition of the corporation concerned\". We waited six months to take further action hoping that the required clinical study reports would be forthcoming from the manufacturers. When this did not happen, RH filed a suit to overturn the JMHLW decision with the Osaka (Japan) District Court on 28 ",

The lists of included studies (33 for oseltamivir, 30 for zanamivir, six for peramivir) were randomly created by the program Edgar II (Brown 2011). Every study was openly allocated to each group according to its number. We initially included six peramivir trials in the randomisation/allocation sequence but subsequently decided not to proceed further, as we were informed by the manufacturers that no clinical study reports would be available until after registration with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (correspondence with Bill Sheridan, 20 August 2010). One review author (TJ) was assigned to the attempted reconstruction of clinical study reports from the FDA documents. Two weeks before 'time lock' (see Glossary in Appendix 1) we received the first batch of clinical study reports from the EMA (formerly EMEA), containing an additional four clinical study reports (including one complete four-module clinical study report) of studies we wanted to include. This time random allocation was achieved by writing trial IDs on one set of tickets and asking an external researcher to allocate them to groups, the names of which had been written on another set of tickets. Authors in pairs separately extracted data from the same clinical study reports of studies included in Stage 1 of the review. When we had more than one copy of the same clinical study reports from different sources (for example, clinical study reports submitted to a regulatory body and clinical study reports from a pharmaceutical company), we independently extracted data from each of the copies and then compared the results. We aimed to record and tabulate disagreements between data extracted from the same source and between different sources. We extracted data using a modified CONSORT statement-based extraction template (Appendix 7). The modified CONSORT-based extraction template aimed to assemble a concise version of the clinical study reports, which would include all important methods as well as define and extract all relevant outcomes. The CONSORT-based extraction template includes the features that would be expected to be found in a published trial report but in far greater detail. Our reconstructions do not include introduction or discussion sections. We extracted the following for each trial. the active drug, some adverse events occurring at similar frequencies in different treatment groups could be related to lactose vehicle inhalation\" (FDA 2000b p.10). We reasoned by analogy and reviewed the medication content of the available clinical study reports of oseltamivir trials. The detailed information comparing content and physical characteristics and batch numbers is in Table 17 . Roche's use of the word 'matching' is not strictly correct as two principles present in the placebo capsules (dehydrocholic acid and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate) are not listed as being present in the active oseltamivir capsules. We could not locate the reason for such a choice in the clinical study reports but both substances may have gastrointestinal action if consumed in large enough quantities. On this basis we formulated two hypotheses: 1a. There is no association between incidence of gastrointestinal harms and a placebo containing dehydrocholic acid in oseltamivir trials. 1b. There is no association between incidence of asthma-related events and a placebo containing lactose powder in zanamivir trials. To test hypothesis 1a we assessed the oseltamivir trials for which we had clinical study reports Module 1 (M76001; WV15670; WV15671; WV15707; WV15812/WV15872; WV15730; WV15819/WV15876/WV15978; WV15758; WV15799) for gastrointestinal tract (GIT) harms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea as well as participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse events. We meta-analysed the results from these studies using the inverse variance random-effects method. We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi 2 test and used Tau 2 to estimate between-study variance. To investigate whether placebo containing dehydrocholic acid may be associated with gastrointestinal harms we compared adverse event rates in placebo groups from the oseltamivir trials (where placebo contained dehydrocholic acid) with adverse event rates in the placebo groups from the zanamivir trials (where placebo did not contain dehydrocholic acid). This comparison was done informally using 1) data obtained from the FDA labels of oseltamivir and zanamivir (FDA 2000b; FDA 2011a) as well as 2) the trials for which we have clinical study reports. As a sensitivity analysis we assumed a similar gastrointestinal adverse event rate in the placebo groups of the oseltamivir trials as was observed in the placebo groups of the zanamivir trials and then repeated the meta-analysis (as described above). We also speculated that withdrawals in the placebo groups due to gastrointestinal adverse events were possibly related to dehydrocholic acid and removed these for the sensitivity analysis. For hypothesis 1b we assessed asthma-related events in nine zanamivir trials for which we had clinical study reports (NAIA3002; NAIB3002; NAIA2005; NAIB2005; NAIB2007; NAIB3001; NAIA3005; NAI30010; NAI30009). We meta-analysed the results from these studies using the inverse variance random-effects method. We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi 2 test and used Tau 2 to estimate between-study variance. To investigate whether placebo containing lactose powder may be associated with asthma-related events we informally compared event rates in placebo groups from the zanamivir trials (where placebo contained lactose powder) with event rates in the placebo groups from the oseltamivir trials (where placebo did not contain lactose powder). As a sensitivity analysis we assumed a similar asthma-related event rate in the placebo groups of the zanamivir trials as was observed in the placebo groups of the oseltamivir trials and then repeated the meta-analysis (as described above). Hypothesis 2. Oseltamivir (or zanamivir) does not affect antibody production in treatment trials. Rationale. All oseltamivir influenza treatment trials specify the primary efficacy analysis population as the influenza-infected population, not the randomised intention-to-treat (ITT) base population. The influenza-infected population (known as ITTI, or intention-totreat-infected in clinical study reports) is determined post-randomisation based on the results of laboratory testing by culture and/or antibody rise (comparing paired sera from the same participant). The sample for culture and the first sample of sera are taken before commencement of trial product but the second or the third sera are taken after patients are treated with trial medication. It is vital that placebo and active groups of patients have the same odds of being classified as influenza-infected, otherwise any comparison between influenza-infected groups will be potentially affected by bias and will essentially be a non-randomised comparison. If trial medication affects the production of antibodies, the selection of the influenza-infected population (which is partly based on antibody production) is confounded by taking the trial medication. Roche have stated on multiple occasions (Smith 2006; Ward 2005; section 3.2.4.2 Serology WV15799) that ingestion of oseltamivir does not affect antibody production and the FDA supports this, stating that \"In studies of naturally acquired and experimental influenza, treatment with TAMIFLU did not impair normal humoral antibody response to infection\" (FDA 2011a). However, we noticed unequal numbers of individuals in the influenza-infected population subgroup in numerous trials. In addition, Takahashi et al reported that oseltamivir significantly suppressed respiratory mucosal secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A responses to antigen (Ag)-specific antibody (Ab) production and also the induction of Ag-specific IgA Ab-forming cells in an animal experiment (Takahashi 2010 ). If taking oseltamivir affects the production of IgG antibody as well, it may affect the selection of the influenzainfected population. We are also unsure of the implication for immunisation with influenza vaccine. According to the FDA, no influenza vaccine interaction study has been conducted with oseltamivir (FDA 2011a).",

            "text": "To test the hypothesis we compared: (1) the odds of participants in the ITT population subsequently classified as influenza-infected; and (2) the odds of participants in the ITT population with a four-fold or more rise of antibody between the placebo and active arms of the trials. If ingestion of oseltamivir does not affect antibody production then we expect the odds of being classified as influenzainfected to be the same for the placebo and active arms. Therefore, we tested a null hypothesis that the odds of having a four-fold or more rise of antibody was the same for the placebo and active arms. We meta-analysed the results from these studies using the inverse variance random-effects method. We assessed heterogeneity using the Chi 2 test and used Tau 2 to estimate between-study variance. The trials included in this analysis were the 10 oseltamivir treatment trials analysed by Kaiser 2003 plus WV15758 for oseltamivir and NAIA3002, NAIB3002, NAIA2005, NAIB2005, NAIB2007, NAIB3001, NAI30009 for zanamivir. These are all the treatment trials for which we have clinical study reports Module 1. In an additional analysis we also assessed the oseltamivir trial conducted in China by Shanghai Roche Pharmaceutical Ltd for which we have a partial clinical study report (ML16369). Hypothesis 3. Oseltamivir does not affect antibody production in post-exposure (or secondary prophylaxis) trials. Rationale. According to the clinical study report of WV15799, the trial programme assessing the effects of oseltamivir in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) consisted of two trials: WV15799 and WV16139. The Module 1s of both trials together with copious FDA notes on trial WV15799 were available to us at 'time lock'. However the PEP trial WV16139 was not standard care or placebo-controlled and so we excluded it from the review. WV15799 was a double-blind, cluster-randomised trial in which contact clusters of index cases were randomised to oseltamivir 75 mg a day or placebo for seven days. The trial formed an integral part of the \"pivotal\" trials package for the supplementary application and review for prophylaxis use of oseltamivir 75 mg in people aged more than 13 years of age, submitted to the FDA on 22 May 2000, approved on 20 November 2000 (FDA 2000c). In the clinical study report Module 1 the manufacturer claimed that the trial provided evidence of the drug's capacity to prevent influenza in contacts by interrupting its transmission from index cases. Since all index cases were left untreated except for a paracetamol rescue pack, it is hard to see how such a claim can be made. The interruption of transmission claim has two components: reduction of viral spread from index cases (measured by nasal shedding of influenza viruses) and prevention of onset of influenza in contacts. This latter claim was based on the definition of (prevented) influenza cases: a mixture of symptoms signs and 'laboratory confirmation' (i.e. viral culture from the upper airways and/or at least a four-fold rise in antibody titres measured between baseline and two to three weeks later). The results of the trial later formed the basis for claims of the drug's effectiveness in interrupting transmission from person to person (WHO 2007) and allow time before the arrival of vaccines in the event of a pandemic. The interruption of transmission claim provided a powerful rationale for stockpiling oseltamivir (see for example vol 8, p.61-62 NICE 2000: \"Ro 64-0796 successfully interrupts the transmission of influenza within households ... and suggests that Ro 64-0796 [oseltamivir] would control the spread of influenza in other closed communities associated with high risk of transmission, such as nursing homes\" \u2026 \"Ro 64-0796 also effectively interrupted virus transmission within households.\") The interruption of transmission indication was accepted by agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but the US FDA refused to register and allow publicity based on any further indication beyond treatment and prophylactic effects on symptoms (FDA 2000f). Review of the evidence from the study protocol and Module 1 together with the FDA criticism explains the rationale for the FDA not supporting the manufacturers' claims. The design of the trial did not allow for comparison of the effects of treating index cases with oseltamivir versus placebo (as all index cases were not medicated) and a repeat viral culture was not performed for all participants. Viral culture was performed at baseline for all participants and thereafter only in participants with influenza-like illness symptoms (see Schedule of assessment for the contact case, WV15799, and the FDA Medical Officer report (FDA 1999c)). Any participants presenting at follow-up with symptoms of influenza had throat and nasal swabs taken in order to confirm the presence or absence of influenza infection (FDA 2000c), thereby missing out on potential asymptomatic infected people. However, a recent review of transmission studies has found no convincing evidence of spread from presymptomatic or asymptomatic subjects (Patrozou 2009), which might explain the FDA's caution in sanctioning any such claim for oseltamivir. Our review of the clinical study report's Module 1 identified further problems with the conduct and reporting of the trial and discrepancies both within the clinical study reports and between the study and its protocol. In the protocol (version H) there is no mention of viral shedding measurement. This appears to be a post-protocol addition, which would explain the unsystematic nature of the viral excretion measurement remarked on by the FDA (i.e. taken from symptomatic contacts only). The primary population of analysis is the so called ITTIINAB population (contacts of ITT influenza-infected index cases who had negative virology at baseline). Although defined in the protocol, the selection and presentation of results for the intention-to-treat contacts of the influenza-infected index case not infected at baseline (ITTIINAB) population has the effect of excluding 57% of the placebo (200/456) and 59% of the oseltamivir (205/497) participants. The effect of selection on the clustering was not formally tested in a sensitivity analysis. Nor is the potential weakness of such a choice discussed in the WV15799 clinical study report. We carried out an analysis using Fisher's exact test, which showed that there was no statistical evidence that the placebo and oseltamivir groups' cluster sizes were distributed differently based on households with an infected index case (P = 0.56) ( Table 2) . By analysing the population by influenza status of the index case, instead of unit of randomisations (all index cases), the beneficial effects of the cluster-randomisations are potentially lost, introducing unknown biases into the analysis. In addition, the generalisability of the conclusions may not be easily applied to clinical practice where testing of suspected influenza cases is often not practical. Cross-checking the definition of ITTIINAB with that reported in the protocol of the other PEP trial, WV16193 (excluded from this review) yields a different definition (PDF page 589) \"The primary outcome in this study (WV15799) was the incidence of influenza occurring among contacts of influenza-infected index cases (the intent-to-treatindex-infected population)\". Throughout the clinical study report of trial WV15799 there are many other apparently contradictory statements on important aspects of the trial, for example, on how many viral swabs and paired sera tests were carried out. The text at page 50 of the Module 1 reports that \"For 21 of the 26 contacts with laboratory-confirmed clinical influenza in the ITTIINAB population the diagnosis was confirmed by culture\" but Table 19 shows the 26 contacts as shedding virus at days two to eight. The same table reports that 178 placebo contacts and 201 oseltamivir contacts were negative for virology (which suggests that they were tested) at days two and eight. However, viral testing only took place at baseline and thereafter only in symptomatic participants. The number of contacts in which influenza was diagnosed only by serology is unclear but it appears to be five (26 minus 21) . These inconsistencies highlight one of the fundamental conceptual problems in understanding the whole oseltamivir prophylaxis trial programme: the mode of action of the drug. Our interpretation of the text suggests that oseltamivir does not prevent infection and does not affect influenza antibody response. As stated above, the claim that oseltamivir does not affect antibody responses has been made by the manufacturers. However, an antibody response is part of the definition of influenza. We are unsure how it is possible that oseltamivir could prevent influenza by stopping symptoms appearing and antibodies rising while at the same time leaving antibody production unaffected. It is for this reason that we decided to test whether administration of oseltamivir for PEP affected the production of antibodies to influenza viruses. The distribution of change in antibodies from baseline to follow-up was compared between the arms of the trials for contacts of the index cases. Analysis was performed using Wilcoxon two-sample test separately for each type of antibody in each trial. An additional analysis of proportion of contacts having a four-fold or greater rise in influenza-specific antibody titre in antibodies was compared between groups using the Chi 2 test. Antibody data were not available for index cases, who were left untreated. In WV15799, antibody testing may have been undertaken at day 1, day 8 and at day 21 \u00b1 4 days for all contacts. Day 8 blood samples for influenza antibody analysis were stored to measure influenza antibody levels only in those contacts who did not attend the follow-up visit (day 17 to 25). Analysis was based on data from the ITTIINAB population at pages 59-60 and Appendix 60 of the clinical study report's Module 1. Hypothesis 4. The number of trial centres and centre withdrawals does not affect the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection (originally the outcome was effect size) and Hypothesis 5. In oseltamivir treatment trials there is no association between the order of randomisations and naso-pharyngeal swabbing (i.e. randomising participants first and then swabbing or swabbing first and then randomising) and the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection (originally the outcome was effect size). Rationale. The proportion of ITT population in the treatment trials of NIs that are subsequently diagnosed as infected with influenza is higher (~50% to 80%) than is usually seen in the course of the winter season in routine clinical care, although high peaks can occur for a very limited period. We know that in some treatment trials, such as WV15670 and WV15671, centres were activated to \"recruit subjects during an influenza outbreak in the locality, detected using standardised surveillance techniques.\" We postulated that unreported procedures may also have been used in the trials to obtain these high proportions of influenza to ILI cases. Two procedures that may have been used are: 1) use of rapid influenza tests to screen out patients based on negative results; 2) dropping of centres that recruited low proportions of infected patients. The use of rapid testing of patients prior to randomisation has been reported in at least one of the zanamivir treatment trials (NAIB3001), in oseltamivir trial WV15670 as a means of excluding infection with H5N1 in the Hong Kong Centre, as a pilot surveillance in suburban London during the 1998 to 1999 winter (NICE 2000 vol.1) and in most oseltamivir paediatric trials to exclude respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. In addition, the schedule of testing varies by trial for the oseltamivir trials with swabbing performed either before randomisation or after randomisation. In at least one oseltamivir treatment trial (WV15730) it was reported that no viral culture was performed at centres from South America (FDA 1999c). As a result of these observations we reformulated Hypothesis 4 as follows: the number of centres and centre withdrawals does not affect the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection (originally the outcome was primary outcome effect size) in oseltamivir treatment trials and Hypothesis 5 as in oseltamivir treatment trials there is no association between the order of randomisations and naso-pharyngeal swabbing (i.e. randomising participants first and then swabbing or swabbing first and then randomising) and the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection. To test hypothesis 4, we used Spearman's rank method to estimate the correlation between average number of patients recruited per centre and the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection. The placebo patients were used for the proportion of patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection because, as we show later in the review, there is evidence that oseltamivir interferes with antibody production and antibody response was used to diagnose influenza infection. We did not analyse the number of centres dropped from studies because information on this variable was not available in Module 1s of the clinical study reports for the included trials (information on patients recruited to each centre is reported in Module 2 which we do not currently have access to). Hypothesis 5 was generated to attempt to explain the seemingly high proportion of influenza-infected influenza-like illness cases in treatment trials. However, we did not formally test this hypothesis as there was only one clinical study report reporting randomisation first then swabbing second (WV15819/WV15876/WV15978) (see also Appendix 10) .",

Hypothesis 1a tested in a sensitivity analysis whether the incidence of gastrointestinal harms may be associated with exposure of participants to a placebo containing dehydrocholic acid. The data obtained from the oseltamivir trials clinical study reports is shown in Table 15 . Overall, the crude adverse event incidence in the placebo groups of the oseltamivir trials was 5.5% for nausea, 3.6% for vomiting and 7.0% for diarrhoea. This compares with crude incidence in the nine zanamivir treatment trials' placebo groups of 4.1% for nausea and vomiting (reported as a combined outcome in the clinical study reports) and 2.8% for diarrhoea. Two studies (WV15670; WV15671) compared three treatment groups: oseltamivir 150 mg bid, oseltamivir 75 mg bid and placebo. To maintain the blinding in these trials, each participant took two pills twice daily. Therefore the participants in the oseltamivir 75 mg bid group took one placebo tablet twice daily. We note that in trial WV15671 there was evidence of a dose-response effect of placebo on incidence of diarrhoea: oseltamivir 150 mg bid (5.9%), oseltamivir 75 mg bid (8.7%) and placebo (11.8%) (P = 0.036). However, there was no evidence found of a similar trend in trial WV15670 (P = 0.88). We were unable to carry out a similar analysis for paediatric treatment trial WV15758 because a detailed content of the placebo preparations is not available (see Table 17 ). Random-effects meta-analysis of the data in Table 15 provided the following results. Nausea: increased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.26, P = 0.004). Vomiting: increased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.62 to 3.31, P < 0.001). Diarrhoea: decreased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.97, P = 0.03). Withdrawal from treatment due to adverse events: no evidence of a difference between treatment groups (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.76, P = 0.75). We carried out a sensitivity analysis by assuming placebo rates of gastrointestinal adverse events in oseltamivir trials based on those observed in placebo groups of similar zanamivir trials. Overall rates of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in placebo groups of zanamivir treatment trials for adults and adolescents were 3%, 2% and 4% compared to oseltamivir treatment trials for adults and adolescents where rates were 6%, 3% and 10% respectively based on FDA-reported data (FDA 2000b; FDA 2011a). Conversely, other common adverse events such as headaches, cough and dizziness had similar incidences of 2% to 3% in the placebo groups of zanamivir and oseltamivir treatment trials (FDA 2000b; FDA 2011a). In the treatment trials of children the rates of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in placebo groups of zanamivir treatment trials were 2%, 3% and 2% compared to oseltamivir treatment trials of children where rates were 4%, 9% and 11% respectively. Our conservative estimate is that the oseltamivir placebo increased rates of nausea two-fold (risk ratio (RR) = 2), vomiting (RR 1.5) and diarrhoea (RR 2.5) compared to the placebo arms in zanamivir trials. Based on the adult and adolescent trials we could conservatively speculate that the substances in the oseltamivir trials placebo increase nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea by 100% (6%/3%), 50% (3%/2%) and 150% (10%/4%) respectively. This could also be considered a conservative assumption because it is plausible that the lactose powder used as the placebo in the zanamivir trials also induced gastrointestinal symptoms, especially in patients that were lactose intolerant. Adjusting the actual rates of these events in the oseltamivir trials placebo groups to be consistent with the zanamivir trials placebo group rates (as reported by the FDA (FDA 2000b; FDA 2011a) and rerunning the random-effects meta-analysis we obtained the following results. Nausea: increased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 3.33, 95% CI 2.44 to 4.54, P < 0.001; test for heterogeneity P = 0.33). Vomiting: increased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 3.46, 95% CI 2.51 to 4.78, P < 0.001; test for heterogeneity P = 0.37). Diarrhoea: increased odds of adverse events due to oseltamivir (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.50, P < 0.001; test for heterogeneity P = 0.50). The estimated effect sizes for nausea and vomiting have increased based on the sensitivity analysis. The effect on diarrhoea has reversed, indicating oseltamivir is possibly associated with increased odds of this adverse event. The results of our analysis support an alternative interpretation to that of the FDA. Finally, we carried out a sensitivity analysis of withdrawal from treatment due to adverse events by assuming no withdrawals due to gastrointestinal events in the placebo group. In total there were nine patients in the oseltamivir trials' placebo groups that withdrew due to gastrointestinal events. When these withdrawals are not included the following result is obtained based on random-effects metaanalysis:",

We conclude that participants in placebo arms of oseltamivir treatment trials experience a higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse events compared to their zanamivir counterparts. As the zanamivir trials' inclusion criteria were similar to the oseltamivir trials (fever and two additional symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI)) this observation cannot plausibly be explained by an incremental role of influenza infection in the genesis of such heterogeneity. It is possible that the difference in reported gastrointestinal adverse events in the placebo groups of zanamivir and oseltamivir trials is due to differences in the collection of these events. However, other common adverse events such as headaches, cough and dizziness had very similar rates in the placebo groups of zanamivir and oseltamivir trials. Despite the results of this sensitivity analysis it is impossible without a clear statement of dosage and rationale of use to assess the role of dehydrocholic acid and possibly calcium phosphate in the causation of such a high incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events. For hypothesis 1b the data obtained from the zanamivir treatment trials clinical study reports are shown in Table 16 . Over all the nine zanamivir trials the incidence of asthma (including asthma exacerbation) in the placebo groups was 2.1% compared to 0.9% in the placebo groups of the oseltamivir trials. Random-effects meta-analysis of the data in Table 16 provided the following results for the combined outcome of any asthma event: Asthma: decreased odds of adverse events due to zanamivir (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86, P = 0.01). We carried out a sensitivity analysis by assuming placebo rates of asthma-related adverse events in zanamivir trials based on those observed in similar oseltamivir trials. If we assume a rate of asthma events in the placebo groups of the nine zanamivir trials similar to that observed in the oseltamivir trials we obtain the following result based on random-effects meta-analysis: Asthma: no evidence of a difference between treatment groups (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.26, P = 0.42; test for heterogeneity P = 0.68). We conclude that zanamivir trial placebo recipients appear to have a higher incidence of asthma-related events than their oseltamivir counterparts. Again, as the inclusion criteria were similar for both trial programmes this finding is not likely to be due to severity of influenza infections but associated with exposure to lactose powder and possibly to the active principle. This is a point remarked on by the FDA. For hypothesis 2 (oseltamivir (or zanamivir) does not affect antibody production in treatment trials) the relevant trials showed strong and consistent evidence that patients randomised to active treatment had reduced odds of being classified as influenza-infected (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94, P = 0.003) with no evidence of heterogeneity (heterogeneity Chi 2 test = 2.80 (df = 7) P = 0.90; estimate of between-study variance Tau 2 = 0.00) (see Table 17 ). There was also strong evidence that patients randomised to active treatment had reduced odds of having four-fold or higher rise in antibody titres (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.90, P < 0.001) with no evidence of heterogeneity (heterogeneity Chi 2 test = 4.61 (df = 7) P = 0.71; estimate of between-study variance Tau 2 = 0.00) (see Table 17 ). In contrast, the zanamivir trials showed no evidence that patients randomised to active treatment had reduced odds of being classified as influenza-infected (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.24, P = 0.52) with no evidence of heterogeneity (heterogeneity Chi 2 test = 3.03 (df = 6) P = 0.81; estimate of between-study variance Tau 2 = 0.00) (see Table 18 ). These results have important implications for the oseltamivir treatment trials programme and for all ongoing trials. All influenzainfected populations are selected post-randomisation and post-trial termination on the basis of laboratory findings (all ITT participants being symptomatic at entry, with aetiology unknown). However, as oseltamivir appears to affect antibody production (or perhaps testing, or both), there may be some participants in the oseltamivir group who were infected with influenza but not diagnosed by the antibody rise and were therefore not counted in the influenza-infected population. These may have subsequently been excluded from the efficacy analysis. It is also possible that the strength of the antibody production limit to qualify for an influenza infection-induced antibody rise (four-four fold and above from baseline) had the effect of selecting the 'stronger' responders into the influenza-infected subgroup of the oseltamivir arm. This would mean that the best antibody producers were selected and this may have led to inflated treatment estimates of efficacy in influenza-infected populations. To investigate this possibility we calculated the correlation between the odds of being classified as infected in the oseltamivir group compared to the placebo group and the size of the primary treatment effect (time to alleviation of symptoms in the ITTI population). In treatment trials all participants are recruited on the basis of symptoms of influenza-like illness. According to the mechanism of action proposed by the manufacturer, infected participants given oseltamivir up to 48 hours from symptom onset should have an antibody response which, given the effects of randomisation, should be similar to that of placebo recipients. Non-responders or weak responders should be spread evenly across the trial arms. All treatment trials of oseltamivir showing evidence of a treatment effect on the primary outcome of the study were included in the analysis. This included two trials for which we did not have clinical full study reports (ML16369; JV15823). We included these trials to increase variation in the two variables used for the analysis. In addition, two trials were excluded: WV15707 which had a total ITTI sample size of 12 participants; and WV15812/WV15872, which was a treatment trial in chronically ill adults that showed no evidence of a treatment effect. Results showed strong evidence of a correlation (Spearman rank correlation = -0.83, P = 0.01) ( Table 19 ). The correlation was highly negative, indicating that lower odds of being classified as ITTI in the oseltamivir group compared to the placebo group is associated with larger treatment effects for the primary outcome of the studies. In contrast, there was no evidence of a correlation between the odds of being classified as infected in the oseltamivir group compared to the placebo group (Table 19 ) and the size of the treatment effect in the ITT population (Spearman rank correlation = -0.23, P = 0.66). A limitation of this analysis is that data for the ITT population for two trials were not available (WV15730; JV15823) (Table 19) . Thus, all influenza-infected comparisons are potentially confounded by the action of the drug (oseltamivir but probably not zanamivir) and are essentially non-randomised comparisons. Any analyses should be based on ITT populations in oseltamivir treatment trials. Analyses and data considered for inclusion in systematic reviews should be based on the ITT (or safety) populations only. Our analysis of Hypothesis 3 shows that the odds of having a four-fold rise in antibodies is 0.33 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.67) for the oseltamivir group compared to placebo (hence a much bigger effect compared to the treatment trials). Due to insufficient information provided in the clinical study report we were unable to take account of the clustering in this analysis, hence the confidence intervals are possibly under-estimated; however an analysis that takes into account clustering is unlikely to change the conclusions. These results show that oseltamivir prophylaxis is associated with lower odds of a four-fold rise in antibodies and this appears to be due to a difference in the distribution of antibody rise in HIAAH3 antibodies but not HIAAH1 or HIB antibodies (see Table 16 , Table 21 , Table 22 and Table 23 ). In summary no conclusions can be drawn from the available evidence on the effects of the drug on viral transmission. The mode of action in prophylaxis appears mainly to be ascribed to symptom suppression or control. There is uncertainty around other possible effects of the drug especially given its interaction with the production of antibodies. We rejected Hypothesis 4 and are currently unable to test Hypothesis 5 We rejected Hypothesis 4 as there was no evidence of correlation between average recruited subjects per centre and the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection (Spearman correlation = 0.26; P = 0.53). Table 24 shows that the average recruited participants per centre ranged from 2 to 11 which appears very low for international, multicentre trials. Two studies failed to reach their recruitment target (WV15707 and WV15730) and two clinical study reports were made up of multiple trials due to the original trial's poor recruitment (WV15819/WV15876/WV15978 and WV15812/WV15872) (Table 24 ). In addition the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection ranged from 63% to 75%, implying little betweentrial variation. We are currently unable to test Hypothesis 5 as only one oseltamivir clinical study report (of three trials) reported randomisation first then swabbing second (WV15819/WV15876/WV15978). In this study the proportion of placebo patients that were confirmed as influenza-infected was 68.1%. This compares with the other seven clinical study reports where swabbing was carried out first and randomisation second and the proportion of placebo patients that were confirmed as influenza-infected ranged from 63.2% to 74.9% with mean 68.1%. Hence it seems that swabbing after randomisation made no difference in the treatment trial programme where this practice is reported. However, with only one clinical treatment study report randomising prior to swabbing available to us, the power to detect a difference in the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection is low. We hope to be able to retest this hypothesis as more data become available. The title confused me: I expected it to be a review of unpublished trials to complement your review of published trials. It would be longer but clearer if you could call it \"Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in healthy adults and childrena review of clinical study reports for published and unpublished trials\".",

This would be an enormous amount \"prior (!) to the emergence of influenza A/H1N1 in 2009\". But Andrew JACK wrote in the cited Financial Times (May 13, 2009): \"Governments around the world had stockpiled 220m treatments to date, swelling sales since the start of 2003 to SFr7.6bn, largely on the basis of preparation for a pandemic virus that has yet to appear.\" So 7.6 billion SFr represent sales and not stockpiling.

            "text": "Summary I am writing to comment on the recently updated meta-analysis by Jefferson and colleagues published through the Cochrane Collaboration and to request clarifications on several points, as well as to suggest some additional analyses that would be helpful in terms of taking greater advantage of this useful database. While I fully support access of Jefferson and other interested investigators to all of the published and unpublished data from the RCTs of oseltamivir and zanamivir for further analyses, this analysis only focuses on RCTs in ambulatory patients with uncomplicated influenza (the vast majority of whom were previously healthy) and on the period before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Consequently, I would urge these investigators to extend their efforts to other populations and datasets examining the risks and benefits of using neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) for treatment and prophylaxis. Furthermore, the authors should acknowledge the limitations of their analyses more explicitly and avoid inappropriate extrapolation to populations and influenza events that the RCTs did not adequately address. Differences in disease pathogenesis related to virus and host factors, as well as time to treatment, have important effects on the utility of antiviral agent interventions. My specific comments and recommendations for additional analyses follow: 1. Use of Intention to Treat (ITT) and ITTI-Infected Groups. The exclusive focus in the current treatment analysis on the ITT population is a readily rectified shortcoming. Outcomes in all three groups of relevance (ITT, ITT-infected, and ITT-noninfected) should be presented, so that readers can examine both clinical effectiveness and efficacy for the key endpoints, as well as events in those without documented influenza. Because NAI treatment would not be expected to provide any benefit in non-influenza illness, not presenting the ITT-infected outcomes in the analysis underestimates possible beneficial drug effects. Assessment of the noninfected group provides a valuable control and also enables a determination of whether there was a potential drug-disease adverse interaction of NAI treatment in non-influenza patients. Of note, our earlier pooled analysis of physician-diagnosed lower respiratory tract complications leading to antibiotic use found a significant benefit of oseltamivir in the influenza-infected patients but not in those enrolled in whom influenza infection was not detected by culture or serology ]. 2. Sample size considerations. Severe outcomes of influenza infection are sufficiently uncommon in previously healthy people that even large RCTs or combining multiple RCTs would be very unlikely to detect them with confidence. The same point applies to very uncommon endpoints like microbiologically documented bacterial complications and rare adverse effects of treatment. Consequently, conclusions that there is no evidence (from trials) that NAIs reduce the risk of pneumonia, hospitalisations, deaths are overstated, as the evidence considered in this analysis is insufficient to properly address these questions. The US CDC has estimated age-related influenza-related hospitalisation and mortality rates for both seasonal epidemics and the 2009 pandemic [Shrestha 2011 ]. Jefferson and colleagues should use such event estimates and others to make calculations of the necessary sample sizes to detect reductions in these severe outcomes with NAI therapy in a controlled RCT across a range of clinically relevant effect sizes (e.g., 20%, 35%, 50% reductions). In a related fashion, they should also provide more quantitative estimates for their ability to detect such outcomes with their existing database and comment more precisely on their power to capture particular endpoints. 3. Complications in ambulatory patients. Other clinically relevant endpoints in these previously healthy and at-risk persons warrant investigation. With regard to influenza-related complications, the most frequent in previously healthy children and adults are respiratory tract infections (otitis media, bronchitis) leading to antimicrobic use. These are usually not severe and typically not microbiologically documented with respect to etiologies but physician-diagnosed complications leading to antibiotic use is an outcome that has important clinical and public health implications (i.e., cost, antibiotic resistance, side effects) and also is sufficiently frequent to demonstrate effects of antivirals. We showed such a benefit in adults in our earlier pooled analyses of the then available RCT data on inhaled zanamivir ] and oral oseltamivir ]. The oseltamivir effect was confirmed in a recent meta-analysis ], and another recent Cochrane report confirms an effect on otitis media in children [Wang 2011 ]. Given the large amount of data available to the investigators, it would be a valuable contribution to also explore the clinical outcomes in greater detail and to clarify the use of terms like severe outcomes. Although uncommon in the populations enrolled in these RCTs, endpoints such as radiographically documented pneumonia, microbiologically documented infections, and hospitalisation or death are clear and should be listed separately in those with or without proven influenza infection. Because of the importance of hospitalisations as an endpoint, it would be helpful to examine not only all-cause hospitalisations but also relevant subgroups based on likely causation (e.g., events in which influenza was documented or likely implicated including exacerbations of co-morbidities vs others like accidents, elective surgeries, conditions unlikely to be influenza-related). In addition to these events, exacerbations of underlying conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD, diabetes, CHF) are of medical importance in influenza outpatients with co-morbidities and should be examined. 4. Data from observational studies. Typically the patients who are most at risk of severe outcomes (older people, infants and young children, those with underlying chronic conditions) are not included in RCTs. In this regard, the current analysis is limited to placebo-or active-controlled RCTs largely done in previously healthy persons and does not consider the multiple observational studies from different countries that have consistently showed protective effects against severe outcomes like pneumonia and hospitalisation, particularly in those with co-morbidities, as well as reduced mortality if patients have been hospitalised. A considerable amount of new treatment data was generated in many countries during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that found timely NAI treatment to be associated with a lower risk for intensive care admission and death (reference list available upon request). While such data and analyses are weaker than RCT data and subject to bias, these observational studies address key endpoints in at-risk and seriously ill populations, including patients admitted to a hospital at the time of initiating therapy, that the available RCTs cannot and do not address. Furthermore, the standard of care has evolved such that placebo-controlled RCT in such patient groups would not be acceptable to investigators or ethics committees. The decision by Jefferson and colleagues not to consider and critically analyse the large amount of observational data with modern techniques means that they are not incorporating key information and many important patient groups in which the available data suggests medically important benefits from early NAI therapy. Such findings from observational data can inform antiviral treatment in more severely ill patients when no other data are available. As discussed above, not to include observational data means that conclusions of no effect on uncommon events or no severe adverse events being detected are almost inevitable. This should be made explicit in the design and the conclusion of the current report. 4. Influenza diagnosis and serologic results. The Jefferson report raises questions about the possible inhibitory effects of oseltamivir therapy on influenza-specific serologic rises and introduction of bias into the outcomes analysis. Further analyses might help to assess these possibilities. They should compare the primary endpoint of illness alleviation between the oseltamivir and placebo subgroups that were culture-positive (irrespective of serologic findings) at enrolment, and separately those that were culture-negative but had serologic evidence of infection. Of note, one prior study of oseltamivir treatment in pandemic 2009 H1N1 patients, although not in seasonal influenza patients, suggested that early treatment could reduce antibody responses [Cowling 2010 ]. Jefferson and colleagues should examine the agerelated frequencies of HAI seroconversions and the GMT titre rises in those with influenza-culture positive illness and separately in those with such HAI rises in absence of culture positivity. Of course, if still available, it would be interesting to test the culture-negative enrolment samples by RT-PCR. The RCT data were generated over multiple seasons in which different influenza A and B viruses were circulating. Influenza B neuraminidases are generally less susceptible to oseltamivir carboxylate and several observational studies indicate that oseltamivir is less effective in influenza B-than influenza A-infected children [Sugaya 2007; Sato 2008 ]. It would be useful to examine the primary outcome in relation to virus type (A vs. B) and if possible A subtype (H3 vs. H1) in those with documented infections to expand on this point. 5. Other treatment endpoints of interest. Since those enrolled in the RCTs were outpatients, it would be useful to explore other endpoints that reflect patient recovery and impacts on the healthcare system (e.g., nonscheduled return visits for complications or adverse events). Perhaps more important than the time to alleviation endpoint used in the registrational trials might be the times to resumption of usual activities and return to pre-morbid status. The authors raise the possibility that oseltamivir might have non-specific antipyretic effects, and one animal model study has also suggested possible adverse immunomodulatory effects of oseltamivir in RSV infection ]. Consequently, it would be interesting to examine the course of fever resolution (a much earlier event than cough resolution) and of symptoms in oseltamivirand placebo-treated patients with and without documented influenza infections. In addition, it would be valuable to examine the correspondence (or lack thereof ) between influenza virologic measures (e.g., enrolment virus titre, time to culture negativity, change in viral titres over time) and symptom resolution measures in both oseltamivir and placebo groups. Various cost-effectiveness analyses on NAI therapy in low-risk populations have been published with widely divergent outcomes, largely depending on the input assumptions. Using this large database, a more refined analysis that incorporates both the direct and indirect (productivity losses) costs of influenza would be informative. 6. Adverse events with treatment. With regard to drug tolerability, it is important to examine not only the frequencies of reported adverse events but also assess indicators of their severity and interference with compliance (e.g., symptom days, patient reported severity, premature cessation of study drug). Comparisons of AEs in the placebo groups across zanamivir and oseltamivir studies need to be interpreted with caution, since these studies were performed in different influenza seasons viruses and locations, with different protocols and case record forms, and by different investigators. Only one head-head RCT of treatment comparing these drugs has been published to date to my knowledge but the design did not include placebo only groups [Duval 2010 ]. In particular, comparisons in children (page 24) need to be age-adjusted as there were major differences in those enrolled into the zanamivir (5 years and older) and oseltamivir trials (1 year and older), and the frequencies of gastrointestinal manifestations are much higher in younger children with influenza and other acute illnesses. 7. Prophylaxis endpoints of interest. The analysis of prophylaxis outcomes and the associated discussion requires clarification. The statement on page 5 says: \"The FDA has also not allowed an indication for interference of viral transmission within households (the key concept behind post-exposure prophylaxis).\" The key concept behind post-exposure prophylaxis is prevention of illness in exposed persons, and the primary endpoint in most prophylaxis studies has been symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. FDA and other regulatory agencies have approved both NAIs for post-exposure prophylaxis in households and also for longer duration preexposure chemoprophylaxis [reviewed in Khazemi 2009 ]. The Jefferson analysis seems to focus exclusively on the effect of chemoprophylaxis in \"preventing the spread\" of influenza, with endpoints presumably determined by evidence of culture or serologically confirmed infection irrespective of illness. While this is one endpoint of interest in such studies, the primary outcome of medical interest is prevention of influenza illness in those exposed. There is abundant RCT data, as well as observational data from the 2009 pandemic, that both inhaled zanamivir and oral oseltamivir have both statistically significant and medically important effects on preventing influenza-specific illness. Of note, the development of serologic evidence of infection without illness is advantageous in those receiving chemoprophylaxis, as it likely is an immunizing event that protects against future infection and illness by that strain. In addition several oseltamivir RCTs have shown significant but lesser effects on influenza infection in prophylaxis recipients ]. The authors should present all of the relevant endpoints in their analysis of the prophylaxis trials. 8. Adverse effects with prophylaxis. The prophylaxis studies are particularly useful in assessing drug tolerability as symptoms of acute illness present in treatment studies are not confounders and there is a more prolonged duration of drug exposure. However, it is essential to examine not only the frequencies of reported adverse events but also indicators of their severity and possible interference with compliance (e.g., symptom days, patient reported severity, premature cessation of study drug). For example, the Jefferson posting states that \"Similarly, a published prophylaxis trial (Hayden 1999a , known by its trial ID WV15673/ WV15697) describes headache as having \"occurred in similar proportions of subjects in the three groups (39 to 47 per cent).\" but indicates that Japanese regulatory documents reached a different conclusion. My own review of the adverse event tabulations from our 6-weeks prophylaxis study (tables provided by the sponsor) indicates that the proportions of subjects reporting headache (not otherwise specified) that might have been related to study drug (unrelated reports excluded) during the treatment phase were similar across the placebo (N=116, 22.4%), oseltamivir 75 mg once (N=124, 23.8%), and oseltamivir 75 mg twice (N=132, 25.4%) daily dose groups ]. Most of these reports indicated mild or moderate intensity and were self-limited. As indicated in the published paper ], study withdrawals for AEs or illness occurred infrequently across these same groups (N=10, 1.9%; N= 8, 1.5%; N= 7, 1.3%). Of note, the specified causes for AE-related withdrawals included three reports of headache associated with other symptoms in the placebo group. In contrast, there were no reports of headache as reason for the withdrawals receiving oseltamivir; gastrointestinal complaints accounted for withdrawals in 4 of 8 oseltamivir 75 mg and 3 of 7 oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily recipients. The total numbers of patients with premature study withdrawal for any reason was 21 (4.0%), 17 (3.3%), and 16 (3.1%) across the three groups, respectively. Overall, severe AEs were reported in 82 (15.8%) of placebo, 75 (14.4%) of oseltamivir 75 mg, and 77 (14.8%) of oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily recipients. We were unable to include these details in the paper because of space limitations but my interpretation remains that no excess of clinically relevant oseltamivir-related headache occurred during this study. This type of detailed AE analysis incorporating severity measures provides necessary context in interpreting the possible importance of AEs. 9. Peer review. The questions raised and opinions expressed in this and earlier Cochrane reports on NAIs by Jefferson and colleagues have resulted in debate and sometimes confusion among practitioners and policy makers regarding the appropriate use of NAIs in seasonal and pandemic influenza responses. Given the importance of these issues, it would be helpful for any future updates to have proper independent review before posting or publication by the Collaboration, as the Cochrane methodology of publication and then independent peer review is not well understood by many people. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments. I look forward to seeing the responses from Dr. Jefferson and his colleagues on these points. We use the term 'adverse events' throughout this document rather than harms or adverse reactions as these latter terms imply causality which may or may not be appropriate. In keeping with the methods of our previous review we will not use data from journal publications for this proposed analysis. We now have access to multiple clinical study reports (CSRs) for both oseltamivir and zanamivir. To our knowledge this is the first time some of these data have been available outside manufacturers and regulators, and allows for the exploration of events in more detail than is possible using the limited information on safety reported in journal publications. This potentially allows us to address some of the concerns that have arisen in the post marketing period about the possible relationship between neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir in particular, and neuropsychiatric and other harms. The documents available to us contain listings and summaries of adverse events recorded in the trials including narrative summaries of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to study withdrawal. The adverse events are classified by relationship to the study drug and also, by intensity (mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening and death). The duration of events is reported and they are also lumped into body systems such as gastrointestinal, neurological, etc.",

However the disease can at times lead to serious complications such as pneumonia and hospitalisations, and if treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the risk of severe outcomes, this would be an important public health benefit. Another potentially important public health benefit would be the ability of antivirals to interrupt person to person transmission of influenza. Current evidence for these outcomes is scarce or inconclusive. A positive balance of effects on complications and viral spread versus harm profile is the main reason for using NIs in a public health context, especially the orally administered oseltamivir. All analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) or safety populations as our prior review discovered compelling evidence that the ITTI (the subpopulation deemed to be influenza-infected) populations were not balanced between treatment groups in the Roche oseltamivir trials. In addition, estimates from the ITT population will be more generalisable to clinical practice where routine testing for influenza is not common in many countries (and even where used, remains of variable accuracy). Analysis will be conducted separately for prophylaxis trials, treatment trials of adults and treatment trials of children. The list of outcomes given below includes all potential outcomes that we believe are clinically important.

            "text": "Submitted by Barry Clinch, 1 James Smith, 2 Andy Kenwright, 1 Bernadette Surujbally, 3 We are members of the Association of Victims of Tamiflu-related Encephalopathy, a group of victims whose children or other family members had serious reactions after taking Tamiflu, including sudden death, accidental death due to abnormal behaviours, and serious sequelae with disability. In this letter, we would like to respectfully request your group to establish the causality between Tamiflu and abnormal behaviours, sudden death or sequelae. We have learnt that the WHO's essential medicines list was amended and Tamiflu was moved from the core to the complementary list, and that its use be restricted to severe illness due to confirmed or suspected influenza virus infection in critically ill hospitalized patients. Moreover, the next Expert Committee might consider Tamiflu for deletion, unless new information supporting the use in seasonal and pandemic outbreaks is provided. We understand that the systematic review your group issued in April 2014 and the opinion you submitted to the WHO have served as the major evidence that promoted the amendment and future possible deletion of Tamiflu from the essential medicines model list. We, all the members of the Association of Victims, deeply appreciate you for conducting such an important systematic review which influenced the policy of WHO. We know the outline of the results of your systematic review because Dr. Rokuro Hama, a Japanese doctor who is one of the members of the Cochrane team translated some important parts of the review into Japanese and uploaded it on his website: http://www.npojip.org/ sokuho/140410.html According to the translation, the results of the systematic review is summarized as follows: 1) Tamiflu reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by 0.7 day (from 7 to 6.3 days). There was no effect in asthmatic children who are the real target of efficacy, although healthy children of Tamiflu group alleviate symptoms one day earlier than placebo group. 2) Tamiflu reduced the production of antibody against influenza. 3) Tamiflu did not decrease hospitalization. 4) There was no evidence that Tamiflu reduce influenza like illness. 5) Tamiflu induced harmful effects such as nausea, vomiting, headache, neurologic symptoms, kidney disorders, diabetic/hyperglycemia and pain in extremities. Zanamivir had no such adverse effects. 6) In particular, neuro-psychiatric symptoms were significantly more reported in Tamiflu group than in the placebo group in the prophylaxis trials. Dose-response relationship was also seen in the treatment trials. \"Abnormal behaviour\" has been listed as one of the adverse reactions to Tamiflu in the Japanese label of Tamiflu since 2004. Hence, we believe that the accidental deaths due to abnormal behaviours after using Tamiflu should be recognized as death cases caused by side effects of Tamiflu, and that they should be relieved by the government. We submitted the applications for damage relief to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), but they rejected them, stating that \"there is no association with Tamiflu use\". We also believe that the sudden deaths during sleep may be the consequences of side effects of Tamiflu because animals died suddenly after the administration of Tamiflu in animal experiments. Therefore, we applied damage relief for the sudden death cases as well, but PMDA rejected them with the same reason. We, 14 families filed cases against PMDA to cancel the decision. Three families (one sudden death and two accidental deaths after abnormal behavior) lost the cases at the Supreme Court. The court accepted the claim of PMDA: the causes of both sudden death and accidental death due to abnormal behaviors were caused by influenza related encephalopathy and not by Tamiflu use because Tamiflu has no effect on brain and there is no evidence suggesting causality in animal, clinical and epidemiologic studies. However, sensory function, cognitive function and consciousness of rats are disturbed and the mortality of rats from sudden death rises as the doses of Tamiflu increases as shown in the review article on the mechanisms of sudden-onset type of reactions to Tamiflu (Hama et al. 2016 ). High dose of Tamiflu stops animals' respiration, followed by cardiac arrest (Kimura and Haji et al. 2013). It induces low body temperature (Ono et al. 2013 ). There are some epidemiologic studies which suggest association between Tamiflu use and delirium or unconsciousness (Fujita et al. 2010 ). There is also an epidemiologic study in which sudden deteriorations leading to death within 12 hours after Tamiflu use were far more frequently reported than after Relenza use ). All these findings suggest close association, but the judges neglected them and concluded that there was \"no causal association\" based solely on the claims of PMDA. We ourselves witnessed extremely abnormal course of dying or developing sequelae in our precious children or other family members. Based on these experiences we are convinced that there is no cause for these events other than Tamiflu. However, we are merely lay people, and we have no scientific means to prove it by ourselves. If your group could establish the causality between Tamiflu and abnormal behaviours, sudden death or sequelae, it would be greatly appreciated. If needed, all the members of our group are willing to provide any information about our family cases. Thank you very much for your understanding and kind assistance in advance.

However, unfortunately we do not have enough information to respond to your specific request to \"establish the causality between Tamiflu and abnormal behaviours, sudden death or sequelae.\" The following explains why we cannot address your specific requests, and offers some thoughts on possibly relevant information that we can speak to based on our Cochrane Review. Our systematic Review published in 2014 did not conduct a statistical test on every type of adverse event that was recorded in the clinical trials that we studied. Doing so may have led to false positives and false negative as well, undermining the reliability of any associations that we might have otherwise been able to detect. Therefore, as we write in the Review, our approach was to meta-analyze \"(1) all serious adverse events; (2) all adverse events leading to study withdrawal; (3) all withdrawals; (4) all adverse events within a clinical study report's defined body system; as well as (5) a small group of common adverse events as defined in the FDA drug label for oseltamivir.\" (p.7). Importantly, \"There were too few events to meta-analyse (1) deaths; (2) serious adverse events by body system; and (3) any events that had an overall incidence of less than 0.5%. We did not meta-analyse outcomes with fewer than 10 events in total\" (p.7). \"Abnormal behaviours\", \"sudden death\" or \"sequelae\" per se did not have an overall incidence of greater than 0.5%, and therefore we did not conduct statistical tests on them.",

To organise receipt of FDA materials, we created a Table of Contents (TOC) listing all the regulatory and pharmaceuticals documents accessible to us.

We also needed a rapid aide memoir with brief summaries of the evidence contained in each regulatory document listed in the TOC. We called this aide memoir the TOCE (Table of Contents -Evidence). As the TOCE contains copious working personal notes aimed to understand the regulatory narrative, we have not reproduced it here but its content is woven into the narrative of this review. Due to the length and format of regulatory documents, we realised in building the TOC that there was a need to formalise the search and identification methods of trials referenced in the FDA documentation. We concentrated on where each trial is mentioned in the documentation by its pharmaceutical code. So, for example, if trial WV15670 is mentioned 60 times by that code in a particular file, then the TOC will report the page numbers in which it is cited, which could be any number up to 60. The unit of search was the file, as a FDA PDF file can contain many different types of documents scanned into the same file. TOC and TOCE are among the tools we specifically constructed for the review (Appendix 1). We wanted to validate our new methods, therefore we compared the yield of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) searching and handsearching of the PDF files of the FDA regulatory material using the same trial ID as a working example. We also searched the material sent to us by Roche for our 2009 update. We searched the website of the Japanese PMDA (http://www.info.pmda.go.jp/shinyaku/shinyaku previous index.html) for data relating to NIs approved in 1999 and 2000 and http://www.info.pmda.go.jp/approvalSrch/PharmacySrchInit for NIs approved since 2001. We identified 1575 pages of documents relating to the regulatory review by the PMDA and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (JMHLW) and the Japanese SBA of oseltamivir capsules for treatment (2000), and prophylaxis of oseltamivir dry syrup for children (2002) and oseltamivir capsules for prophylaxis of influenza (2004) and their re-examination results. The Japanese regulatory body introduced a system to disclose their examination results and SBA in 1999 instead of the prior system, 'full disclosure requirement system', which had been introduced in 1967. Although these documents included preclinical, methodological, clinical (pharmacological, toxicity and pharmacokinetics with metabolism) data and clinical (phase I to phase III) studies and contain more precise data than the Thus the relative effect estimate adjusts for baseline variations between trials, it is informative for most readers because people are familiar with percentages, and it makes it easier to compare different treatments for related conditions. For these reasons I would like to encourage the authors to calculate and report the relative effect estimates for oseltamivir in the next revision of the review.",

CI: confidence interval; RR: risk ratio In the end, the 2009 update was inconclusive regarding whether or not oseltamivir reduced the risk of complications of influenza (Jefferson 2010a), as we were unable to verify the data underlying manufacturer and government claims to this effect. The claims were based on clinical trial evidence included in a published pooled analysis of 10 manufacturer-funded clinical trials of oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in people of 13 years and older . Eight of the 10 trials in the Kaiser et al pooled analysis have never been published (Jefferson 2009a) , and their complete data sets were not available from either the authors or the manufacturers. Some of the published trials had been ghost written (Cohen 2009). The largest of the 10 Kaiser trials (M76001), involving over 1400 people, had been briefly reported in conference abstract format but the person whose name appeared on the abstract could not recall ever presenting its results or being involved with the study (Cohen 2009). Our early requests for data from the 10 Kaiser studies were met with an offer from Roche to sign a confidentiality agreement with an embedded secrecy clause preventing us from mentioning the existence of the agreement. The unsigned agreement can be seen at http://www.bmj.com/highwire/filestream/440792/field highwire adjunct files/0. At the time of publication of the 2009 update and its linked investigation by the BMJ, we were unaware of the size and depth of the oseltamivir evidence development programme. We thought it comprised around 36 trials and we expected that only a proportion of these would fit our inclusion criteria. We also did not realise the size and the level of detail that the clinical study reports contained. ",

The obvious source of such information would be trial registries but most trials of both NIs were carried out before inception or wide acceptance of centralised registries. As single, authoritative, up-to-date and complete lists of all clinical trials conducted on humans using a given drug are rarely available in the public domain, there was no alternative to constructing our own. We decided to do so by using multiple, cross-referencing methods. We constructed a list beginning with clinical trials identified from previous review updates. To this end, we added additional trials in humans from multiple sources, including manufacturer submissions to regulators, drug product information sheets, previous published reviews, Health Technology Assessment ( Finally, we also conducted traditional database searches (Appendix 5) and searches of grey literature to identify previously unknown trials.To ensure the list did not include duplicate entries, we assigned each trial a Unique Trial ID. 'Author' is not a good choice of Unique Trial ID, as different authors can be present across different versions of the same trial (that is, the authors of clinical study reports can be different from publications arising from the same clinical trial). Nor are any other details connected to publications a good option for Unique Trial ID because not all studies are published. Some trials will have company-specific codes and some will have public clinical trial registry numbers, or both or neither. The majority of trials cited in this review are manufacturer-funded (with corresponding manufacturer protocol IDs) and to simplify recognition and terminology we have used the manufacturer protocol ID as our Unique Trial ID. A list is only helpful so long as it has sufficient details to enable us to decide whether it meets our inclusion criteria. For each Unique Trial ID, we gathered the following details.",

Hypothesis 1. Incidence of certain harms is not associated with placebo content. Hypothesis 2. Oseltamivir (or zanamivir) does not affect antibody production in treatment trials. Hypothesis 3. Oseltamivir does not affect antibody production in post-exposure (or secondary prophylaxis) trials. Hypothesis 4. The number of trial centres and centre withdrawals does not affect the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection (originally the outcome was effect size). Hypothesis 5. In oseltamivir treatment trials there is no association between the order of randomisations and naso-pharyngeal swabbing (i.e. randomising participants first and then swabbing or swabbing first and then randomising) and the proportion of placebo patients subsequently diagnosed with influenza infection. Hypothesis 1. Incidence of certain harms is not associated with placebo content. Rationale. While reviewing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) critique of zanamivir, we noted the regulators' concern over the apparent drop in forced expiratory volume (FEV) following zanamivir inhalation (FDA 1999a), which appeared to be enhanced by the lactose powder excipient content of the active blister (FDA 1999b). The powder, which causes bronchospasm in susceptible individuals, was contained in both the active and the placebo blisters. This principle of using a matching placebo is of course correct but may have had the effect of increasing the incidence of bronchospasm (or asthma-related episodes) in both arms. This is clearly reported as a warning in the 1999 FDA label \"Because the placebo consisted of inhaled lactose powder, which is also the vehicle for Appendix 11. Example of contents of a Clinical Study Report (from page 1 of WV15670 report)",

However, it does not appear to be clearly defined either in the protocol or in Jefferson's comment in the 15 Jan 2011 edition of the BMJ. Additionally, the term 'unpublished data' is misleading. It appears the Cochrane Group use this term interchangeably with Clinical Study Reports, regardless of whether a primary manuscript is available for a given study. We suggest this is clarified or preferably replaced, especially since the term appears extensively in the protocol including the title. Readers are likely to use the terms 'unpublished data' and 'unpublished trials' (trials for which no primary publication appears in the scientific press) interchangeably. A suggested replacement is 'Clinical Study Reports' since this term is not easily misinterpreted and is clearly defined in Jefferson's BMJ comment.\u2022 The 'scope of clinical trial data' are defined in Jefferson's BMJ 15 Jan 2011 comment, as mentioned above (i.e. definitions for clinical study reports, raw data, unpublished trial, published trial, regulatory data).

Does this refer to 'the time to alleviation of symptoms' or 'reduction in symptom score' or another endpoint?

The protocol states \"At the participant level (i.e. within a trial) we will not make any assumptions about missing data.\" This is not possible, because an analysis of data that is collected in a trial can only be done in the context of assumptions about potential mechanisms that led to data being missing (e.g., missing completely at random, or missing at random).\u2022 Meta-analysis Method. Little detail is given in the protocol. The protocol states that \"Whether or not heterogeneity is detected, we will perform a random effects meta-analysis. Random-effects methods will be used to compare the dichotomised outcomes (RR and absolute risk reduction (ARR) for efficacy and safety).\" There are several different Random Effects methods available (Bayesian or frequentist, DerSimonian & Laird or Maximum-likelihood or REML), and different approaches to handling rare events (various \"corrections\" to include trials with zero counts). Furthermore, would random-effects methods also used to compare the continuous outcomes?\u2022 Fixed-effects Model. The protocol also states that fixed-effects models will be used in a sensitivity analysis. No details are given with regard to which fixed-effects models will be used. There are several fixed-effects models available including Inverse Variance, Mantel-Haenszel, and Peto's method. The appropriate method used should also depend on the outcome measures (dichotomous vs. continuous; relative vs. absolute). The approach and choice of models for sparse data and rare events should be provided. Furthermore, various methods in the framework of fixed-effects model may be explored to evaluate the robustness of the results.\u2022 Hazard Ratio. The protocol states \"We will convert medians of treatment groups into (log) hazard ratios (estimating the variance of these) to enable meta-analysis of time to event outcomes.\" Although hazard ratio (HR) is a standard analysis and widely recommended approach for time-to-event data in clinical trials, the HR analysis may not be suitable for the Relenza studies with relatively short follow-up time because the assumption of proportional hazards required for the proportional hazards model may not hold. GSK did not follow this approach for the original analysis due to the concern stated above. Further the clinical and regulatory interest centred on differences in the time to alleviation not in the relative hazard between treatments. The above issues would be best addressed by using subject level rather than summary data, which GSK have offered to provide to the Cochrane Group.\u2022 Analysis Populations. The protocol does not specify which populations will be used for the various analyses, for example, intentto-treat or influenza-positive or other. We believe that influenza positive population is appropriate, especially for the efficacy analysis using time to alleviation of influenza symptom as a primary endpoint consistent with the prescribing information for Relenza.\u2022 Study Duration. No details are given in the protocol with regard to how studies with different follow-up times will be handled.\u2022 Trials with no Events. No details are given in the protocol with regard to how to deal with trials in which there are no events (such as death). By excluding studies with no events will make the event appear more common than it actually is. There are various techniques: Bayesian approach, continuity correction, combining similar trials to avoid having any components of the analysis that have no events.\u2022 Sensitivity Analyses. Sensitivity analyses using different outcome measures, statistical models and/or continuity correction factors to assess the robustness of the results are strongly encouraged. ",

In these trials, the selection of \"infected\" or \"non-infected\" was dependent on the results of serology that is affected by \"use\" and \"non-use\" of oseltamivir.

First, analyses were performed on the ITT-infected sub-population which we have shown to be non-comparable between treatment groups. Second, the authors analysed an outcome that was different to that pre-specified in the trials. In the trials, complications included otitis media and sinusitis but in the Kaiser et al paper these were not included. This is an example of selective reporting or \"cherry picking\". Third, complications were not objectively or consistently measured in the trials. Fourth, outcomes such as pneumonia and bronchitis could be either reported as a complication or as an adverse event according to a classification criteria we do not understand and is not discussed in the Kaiser et al paper. And finally the data from the 10 trials was not meta-analysed, rather, it was combined as if generated from one single trial. We could potentially address most of these limitations (except for the third) but we have not been given access to the data despite repeated requests to the manufacturer. However we were able to compare hospitalisations as those data were available to us for the ITT population. We found no evidence of effect on hospitalisations based on seven studies with a median placebo group event rate of 0.84% (range 0% to 11%): odds ratio (OR) 0.95; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.61, P = 0.86). This result is quite different to that reported by Kaiser et al based on the (non-comparable) ITT Infected population. In terms of power analysis, to detect a significant difference at this level of difference of 0.84% (placebo) vs 0.80% (oseltamivir), with alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.8, a RCT with approximately 800,000 participants is required.",

Analysis of the \"population with proven influenza infection\" (ITT-infected population) is not appropriate (see above). Data for the analysis of \"population without proven influenza infection\" are not available to us. As we have shown above, the power to detect a difference in all-cause hospitalisation is very small hence to do a subgroup analysis on this outcome seems unwarranted. The pharmacological/toxicological adverse effects of oseltamivir can be classified into two major types [3] . One is sudden type occurring during the hypercytokinemic state in the early phase of infection including sudden death [3, 4] , accidental death after abnormal behaviours and vomiting induced by the central depressing action of unchanged oseltamivir [4] . The second are delayed type of reactions including recurrence or exacerbation of influenza and/or other infection, diabetes, bleeding, renal impairment and delayed type neuropsychiatric reactions related to inhibition of the host's neuraminidase [3] . Sudden type adverse effects should be collected and analysed only during the early phase of influenza (for example, vomiting was only significantly increased within one day of treatment in the paediatric RCTs). However, delayed type adverse effects should be collected and analysed for a longer period to detect those reactions after a full course of treatment (for example the increase of pneumonia in the off-treatment period in the paediatric RCTs). A recently published proportional mortality study has indicated that oseltamivir increases sudden type of death (odds ratio: 5.9) compared with zanamivir users by analysing all death cases among approximately 20 million 2009A/H1N1 influenza patients in Japan. This effect was also true for the comparison of oseltamivir users with non-users of antivirals [4] .",

            "text": "Observational studies during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak have assessed the effects of oseltamivir on a selected population of hospitalised patients. These represent a very small proportion of the total population who get influenza. While subgroup analyses are important, it is important to not lose sight of the fact that the use and governmental stockpiling of oseltamivir is for its routine use in asymptomatic and symptomatic members of the community. Our review thus considers the evidence base that applies to the vast majority of people. In addition, the studies Dr. Hayden appears to be referring to are retrospective observational studies in which apparent treatment effects may be the result of an effective treatment but could also be due to confounding effects. Unfortunately there is no way to determine which of these possibilities is true. That is why drug regulators require evidence from RCTs to determine whether or not a drug is approved for use. According to the analysis by Jones and Hama [5] , apparent protective effects against severe outcomes like pneumonia, hospitalisation and mortality are possibly derived from survivor treatment selection bias (or immortal time-bias). This is not an issue for randomised controlled trials because follow up begins at the time of randomisation which is the same for patients allocated to active drug and patients allocated to placebo. However in the case of observational studies treatment can begin at varying times (up to several days) after the onset of symptoms. Therefore a naive comparison that compares a binary outcome, such as death (or other adverse event), or time to an event (survival time) is at high risk of survivor treatment selection bias (also referred to as immortal time bias or simply time dependent bias). This bias can occur, for example, because patients who die early are not given the opportunity to receive treatment. In addition patients who are extremely sick may not be given the opportunity to receive antivirals because other treatments and procedures take priority. This bias can be addressed with an appropriate analysis however this has not been done in any of the observational studies of antiviral use for influenza that we have seen.",

Analysis of the population with documented influenza infection (ITT-Infected population) is not valid (see above). Hence we are unable to conduct a valid analysis in the influenza positive population and data for the influenza negative population has not been provided. Antibody titre is one of the ways of selecting only subjects infected with influenza. However we have shown that the production of antibodies was consistently lower in the oseltamivir group compared to the placebo group in the treatment trials. Therefore the use of antibody production to confirm influenza in prophylaxis trials is not valid. Moreover comparison of the proportion with confirmed infection between the oseltamivir group(s) and the placebo group will provide misleading results. Nor are \"virus titre\", \"time to culture negativity\" or \"change in viral titres over time\" a true measure of viral load, because oseltamivir as a neuraminidase inhibitor may conceal positivity by inhibiting the influenza virus from leaving the surface of host respiratory cells (which are covered by a mucous layer on the surface of the cells).",

We did not meta-analyse data from the prophylaxis trials in this systematic review because the substantial documents for prophylaxis trials were obtained after the time lock of 12 April 2011. Due to the problems we have illustrated above on using virus titre to confirm influenza infection we plan to amend the primary endpoint for prophylaxis trials to influenza-like illness (ILI). There is some fear that those with serologic negative infection without symptoms may be more easily infected with influenza virus in the future, because evidence from animal experiments shows that IgA antibody in the respiratory mucosa is reduced (to about 20% of the control group), while reduction of those of systemic IgG antibody (HI antibody) was slight and not statistically significant [6] .",

            "text": "Summary I am writing to respond to the comments and questions raised by Jefferson and his colleagues to my letter of 2 February 2012 about their report published through the Cochrane Collaboration. While the authors have provided helpful clarifications to many points, I remain concerned about their selective approach to data analysis and presentation. Resolution of these issues is important in anticipation of future analyses by Jefferson and colleagues or by others. Many of their responses indicate that analysis of the cohorts with proven influenza infection (ITT-infected) are not appropriate but further analyses of patient level data should be able to address their concerns (see below). Also they identify biases that could make oseltamivir look better but not those that could make it look worse than its effectiveness and tolerability likely are in reality. An impartial analysis would identify biases in both directions and attempt to deal with them in a balanced appraisal. My specific comments and recommendations for additional analyses follow: 1. Use of intention to treat (ITT) and ITTI-infected groups. One obvious means of addressing the concern about selection bias in defining the ITT-infected (ITTI) population for analysis is to focus on those who were influenza virus-positive (irrespective of serologic results) at enrolment. These individuals (ITTI-virus) represented approximately 70-85% of those enrolled into the ITTI cohorts across the various RCTs. In addition, those who were included in the ITTI group solely on the basis of seroconversion could be analysed separately to assess overall comparability in terms of symptom resolution and complications to those who were both virus-positive (ITTI-virus) and showed serologic rises. This might also help determine whether inclusion of data from virus-negative seroconverters would affect overall findings. In contrast to the Cochrane statement that \"And selection of those with \"serology-positive results\" appears to have given the advantage to the oseltamivir group\", it might alternatively be disadvantageous (bias toward the null) or neutral in effect.

            "text": "most beneficial in preventing lower respiratory tract (LRT) complications leading to antibiotic use in those in whom it also prevents seroconversion, as one might expect if its overall treatment effect varies between patients based on timing of administration, individual pharmacokinetics or other factors, then its protective effect on complications will be underestimated because the benefits in those for whom it prevents seroconversion will not be counted. If, on the other hand, treatment works effectively only in those infected who seroconvert and has little or no effect in those in whom it prevents seroconversion, this would increase the apparent benefit. However, the only way in which this sequence seems possible would be if late treatment does not interfere with seroconversion but early treatment does AND late treatment is more effective than early. This is biologically implausible and inconsistent with the observed effects on time to treatment for other outcomes, in which early treatment is associated with greater effects. Alternatively, if oseltamivir treatment has a similar effect on LRT complications in infected who seroconvert and those who do not, this would reduce the numbers in the treated group with and without outcomes in a non-differential way. In addition to a possible non-specific immunomodulatory effect of oseltamivir on serologic responses or possible confounding effect of prior inactivated influenza vaccine which might blunt antibody responses in those with proven influenza (1), one explanation for the apparently lower seroconversion rate in oseltamivir recipients would be that some oseltamivir recipients had low viral replication levels at enrolment that were quickly reduced by treatment and did not stimulate antibody rises, so that in these persons treatment prevented seroconversion. If one assumes that clinical outcomes are linked to viral replication levels as other reports suggest, such individuals would probably have shorter illness duration and also be less likely to develop LRT complications. Consequently, not counting them in the oseltamivir group would bias towards the null and under-estimate the effect of treatment on both illness resolution and complications. In this regard, comparing outcomes in the ITTI-virus seroconverters vs non-seroconverters would be of interest if sufficient numbers are available. Also, as stated previously, analysis of the serologic responses based on time from symptom onset to enrolment, including both frequency of seroconversion and observed titres rises in the ITTI-virus group compared to placebo, might help address this possibility. If I have interpreted their report correctly, the post-hoc analyses by Jefferson and colleagues found an absolute difference of 3.4% in overall infection rates between placebo (68.9%) and oseltamivir (65.5%) groups across the studies they analysed ( Figure 5 , Table 17 ). This difference presumably approximates the fraction of virus-negative, non-seroconverting but possibly influenza-infected subjects in oseltamivir group. To what extent this difference might bias outcomes is uncertain but its relatively modest size suggests that misclassification would not be a major confounder in either the ITTI or ITT-non-infected groups. Optimally in future studies more sensitive nucleic acid amplification testing will be used to detect infection by influenza and other respiratory viruses and facilitate more clear delineation of the groups of interest. In summary, further analyses of the RTCs on oseltamivir and zanamivir, the outcomes in all groups of relevance (ITT, ITTI, ITTIvirus, and ITT-non-infected) are important and should be presented as fully as possible. As stated previously, separate assessment of the ITT-non-infected group provides a valuable control and also enables a determination of whether there was a potential drugdisease interaction of NAI treatment in non-influenza patients. As specific antiviral treatment would not be expected to provide benefit on illness resolution or complications in non-influenza illness, examining the ITT-non-infected groups allows this point to be tested directly. An analysis of 11 oseltamivir RCTs (2) confirmed lack of treatment effect on LRT complications in non-influenza-infected subjects compared to placebo. The failure to present outcomes in the ITT-infected or ITT-virus cohort underestimates possible beneficial drug effects, whereas full data presentation would enable readers to examine the event rates and magnitude of treatment effect sizes for key outcomes across all relevant groups for themselves. 2. Sample size considerations. The endpoint used in our pooled analysis of oseltamivir RCTs (3) was prospectively defined before the analysis was undertaken and was based on findings in our earlier study of zanamivir treatment effects (4) that indicated inhaled zanamivir reduced LRT illnesses leading to antibiotic prescriptions (RR, 0.60; 95% CI 0.42-0.85) but not upper respiratory tract ones (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.63-1.27). The oseltamivir analysis used all studies available to us at the time, including unpublished clinical study reports, in order to avoid selection bias. The other endpoints of upper respiratory tract complications leading to antibiotic use (6.8% oseltamivir vs 5.9% placebo) and overall antibiotic use (14.0% oseltamivir vs 19.1% placebo; P <.001) were described in our 2003 paper (page 1760). Of note, the reductions in overall antibiotic use in influenza outpatients were similar for zanamivir (28%) and oseltamivir (27%) treatment. The limitations of the clinical diagnoses and retrospective approach used in these studies were described more fully in the earlier zanamivir paper (4). However, the simple pooled analysis we undertook in the oseltamivir paper did not correct for the higher proportion of influenza-infected, at-risk individuals in the placebo group, and this was a shortcoming. In any case, we pointed out this difference in the paper (page 1669) and presented the data by each group of interest (previously healthy or at risk) in Tables 3 and 4 . More importantly, our finding that early oseltamivir treatment reduced the likelihood of physician-diagnosed LRT complications leading to antibiotic use has been confirmed and extended (37% reduction in oseltamivir group; risk ratio 0.63 [95% CI 0.48, 0.82]) in a subsequent meta-analysis (that controlled for pre-enrolment risk status and included events from the time of enrolment) of the same 10 RCTs included in our paper and one additional one (2) . Furthermore, this analysis found that the unpublished trials for which Jefferson and colleagues apparently do not have data were found to be no more favourable to oseltamivir than the published ones.

            "text": "Differing age-related patterns of influenza-associated encephalopathy/encephalitis and NPAEs have been reported in Japanese children and adolescents, and also agerelated differences exist in NAI prescribing patterns in Japan. Consequently, careful analysis is required to assess possible associations. It is important to point out that causal relationships between oseltamivir use and such events remain to be proven. Some analyses have indicated comparable or lower NPAEs rates in oseltamivir-treated compared to non-treated influenza patients (reviewed in (5)) and no higher rates of NPAEs have been found in hospitalised infants in the USA (6) . Oseltamivir administration to those with influenzaassociated NPAEs does not appear to worsen manifestations (7;8) . Of note, the crude reporting rates for possible oseltamivir-associated NPAEs in Japan and USA were significantly lower during the 2009 pandemic than during preceding influenza seasons (9) . As pointed out by Jefferson and colleagues, the possibility of late-onset adverse events requires that sufficient follow-up be incorporated into study design to examine both possible adverse and beneficial effects. However, the low frequencies of such events would likely require much larger numbers of subjects than enrolled in most RCTs. One approach is retrospective examination of large databases that link healthcare visits, clinical diagnoses, and drug administration registries. For example, one cohort study involving over 150,000 subjects (49,238 oseltamivir recipients, 102,692 control patients) reported that oseltamivir treatment of presumed influenza was associated with lower risk of TIA or stroke in the subsequent six months (10) . This kind of observational study approach has been undertaken for investigation of outcomes and possible adverse events following influenza immunisation and should also be extended to antivirals. 4. Data from observational studies. Jefferson and colleagues indicate that possible survivor treatment selection bias in observational studies can occur because patients who die early are not given the opportunity to receive treatment. However, there is also the opposite concern that sicker patients, especially in a rapidly evolving illness like influenza, are more likely to initiate therapy at any given time after symptom onset than less ill ones. This would be a conservative bias and reduce the likelihood of observing a treatment effect. Clinical experience during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic indicated that late NAI treatment in critically ill or non-surviving influenza patients was frequently due to delayed consideration of the diagnosis or failure to appreciate the potential value of starting treatment beyond two days after symptom onset in those with progressive illness or high-risk conditions. This occurred often despite some of these patients having had prior outpatient contact for their acute illness. Although the published reports indicate that most critically ill patients ultimately received antiviral therapy, delayed treatment commonly led to initiation of NAI administration as part of a salvage effort in a deteriorating patient. In part because of critical care support, even those patients who died in hospital usually survived into the second week of illness or later. Those analysing the large amount of observational data that has been generated in recent years, particularly in the context of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, need to keep these clinical observations in mind. Of note, a recent analysis of critically ill pandemic H1N1 patients in California compared mortality in untreated patients who survived at least to the day after symptom onset when NAIs were first given to the NAI-treated ones and found that cases who received NAI up to 4 days after symptom onset were more likely to survive (P < 0.05 for each day 0-4) (11). An independent report on the observational studies of influenza antivirals published up to November 2010 (12) conducted a metaanalyses of the few studies providing effects adjusted for confounders and, while acknowledging the low quality of the evidence based on the GRADE assessment approach, concluded that in high-risk populations, oral oseltamivir may reduce mortality (odds ratio, 0.23 [95% CI 0.13 to 0.43]) and hospitalisation (odds ratio, 0.75 [95% CI 0.66 to 0.89]). In addition, as reported in multiple studies of hospitalised pandemic 2009 A(H1N1) patients, including high-risk ones like pregnant women and those admitted with pneumonia, treatment with oseltamivir up to 4 days and in some studies later after illness onset has been associated consistently with better outcomes (11;13-21) . Such observations have served to reinforce US CDC recommendations for using influenza antivirals as early as possible in those with severe or progressive illness, those hospitalised with suspected or proven influenza, and outpatients at higher risk for influenza complications (22) . Furthermore, given that the circulating influenza viruses have continued to change, with the pre-2009 A(H1N1) seasonal viruses being entirely replaced by A(H1N1)pdm09 and now antigenically drifted A(H3N2) and B viruses, ignoring observational data means that only information concerning NAI treatment for influenza viruses that are now no longer circulating is being considered. 5. Other treatment endpoints of interest. The possibility that oseltamivir might have non-specific antipyretic or immunomodulatory actions unrelated to its antiviral effects has been raised in part on the basis of murine studies (23;24). These possibilities or other symptom-modifying effects could be addressed by comparison of the course of fever and individual symptom resolution between oseltamivir and placebo recipients for those enrolled in the RTCs who did not have laboratory evidence for influenza (ITT-noninfected). Of note, antipyretics were provided to participants in these trials, so that use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) needs to be included as a confounder in such analyses.",

            "text": "In the published pivotal RCTs of oseltamivir treatment in adults, the fever and symptom reductions observed in oseltamivir recipients were in addition to the effects of paracetamol (acetaminophen). One previous RCT in adults with uncomplicated influenza compared amantadine to aspirin and found faster fever resolution in aspirin recipients but slower resolution of other symptoms and higher rates of adverse effects leading to drug cessation (25) . While fever resolution is an objective endpoint of interest, it is generally short-lived and of limited clinical importance relative to other endpoints like time to symptom alleviation, time to return to usual activities/premorbid status, and complications reductions. The comment by Jefferson and colleagues on measuring viral loads is confusing. Virologic endpoints like quantitative virus titres (infectious and in recent studies viral RNA), time to culture negativity, and changes in titres over time are essential to determining whether a putative influenza antiviral treatment is exerting an antiviral effect and the magnitude of that effect. Failure to detect an antiviral effect raises questions about issues like compliance, drug absorption and disposition, lack of potency, and resistance emergence. Examining such virologic measures also serves to confirm the likely mechanism of antiviral action of NAIs, inhibiting release from infected cells and spread in respiratory tract secretions to initiate subsequent rounds of replication. Several observational studies during the 2009 pandemic found that early antiviral treatment (<2-3 days from symptom onset) was associated with reduced duration of viral RNA detection (26) (27) (28) . Consequently, in the context of the oseltamivir RCTs, it would be valuable to examine the correspondence between upper respiratory tract influenza virologic measures and symptom resolution and LRT complications in both oseltamivir and placebo groups. 7. Prophylaxis endpoints of interest. As indicated in my initial letter, the key efficacy endpoint for an influenza antiviral used for prophylaxis should be symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza illness. Given the potential for other respiratory viruses to cause febrile respiratory illness, a focus on ILI as the primary endpoint will inevitably underestimate the protective effects of an influenzaspecific chemoprophylactic agent. Of note, various definitions of symptomatic illness and ILI have been used in the influenza prophylaxis RCTs to date, so that further analyses using standardised definitions would be a helpful contribution. Other secondary endpoints of interest include laboratory documented infection (irrespective of symptoms), ILI, virus-positive ILI, and laboratory-confirmed illnesses not meeting the ILI definition. Laboratory confirmation based on both viral culture and in future studies viral RNA detection would take advantage of the greater sensitivity of RNA detection. 8. Adverse effects with prophylaxis. As detailed in the oseltamivir seasonal prophylaxis study protocols and report, the relationship between drug receipt and adverse events, including headache, in these trials (29) was determined by the study staff and investigators during the trial under blinded conditions before data lock. The assessment of causality in adverse events (unrelated, remote, possible, probable) as related to drug administration was made using pre-specified criteria in the protocol (see Appendix 2) on an individual basis by both interviewing the affected participant and considering various factors including past patterns of headaches, associated symptoms, duration and severity, timing in relation to study drug, and whether the symptom persisted during drug administration. Because of its background frequency in the population, headache is a very common event in longer term studies. When it is mild or transient despite continued drug administration, or when it occurs in context of other events (URI, trauma, stress), headache is unlikely to be drug-related. Using these criteria and the analysis report provided by the sponsor Roche, we observed headache (not otherwise specified, NOS) that was probably, possibly, or remotely related to study drug administration in 22.4% of placebo, 23.8% of once daily oseltamivir, and 25.4% of twice daily oseltamivir recipients during the 6 weeks of prophylaxis (29) . The proportions were 10.2%, 8.7%, and 10.8%, respectively, for headache (NOS) that was possibly or probably related to study drug administration. Headache is a good example of where it is essential to examine not only the frequencies of reported adverse events but also their severity and functional impact, including premature cessation of study drug. In our 6-week prophylaxis trial (29) , severe headache (NOS) irrespective of relationship to study drug administration was reported in 5.0% of placebo, 3.3% of once daily oseltamivir, and 6.9% of twice daily oseltamivir, respectively. Overall premature study withdrawals were found in 21 (4.4%) of placebo, 17 (3.3%) of once daily oseltamivir, and 16 (3.1%) of twice daily oseltamivir recipients. In three placebo but no oseltamivir recipients, headache was listed as a contributory factor. However, headache was reported to be a factor leading to cessation of oseltamivir prophylaxis in one subject in another prophylaxis study (30) and was also reported at a higher frequency during 6-weeks prophylaxis in a nursing home-based RCT (5.5% placebo vs 8.3% oseltamivir) (31) , so that further analyses are warranted. 9. Peer review. I thank Jefferson and his colleagues for their clarifications on the Cochrane peer review process, and as indicated above, I have provided my own suggestions on the design of future analyses by them and others. In addition, I have provided a list to the Cochrane Editorial Unit of several dozen potential expert reviewers for future protocols and reports on influenza antivirals. Thank you for the opportunity to provide these responses and comments. This category applies to those adverse events which are considered, with a high degree of certainty, to be related to the test drug. An adverse event may be considered probable if: 1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug. 2. It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject's clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 3. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction of dose. (There are important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug-relatedness clearly exists; e.g., (1) bone marrow depression, (2) tardive dyskinesias). 4. It follows a known pattern of response to the study drug. 5. It reappears upon re-challenge.",

You detail these concerns in more detail: 1. ITT and ITTI You propose an analysis of ITTI in which patients are categorised not by an immune response (which we regard as potentially flawed because our interpretation of the data suggests the drug may interfere with the immune response) but instead by determining whether patients were seroconverting excreting influenza virus at enrolment. This sounds sensible, and were the data of symptoms and baseline infectivity (by serology or even virus shedding) available to us in suitable format, we would include this analysis. By this, we would expect the randomisation of patients into the two groups to be independent of the initiation of the drug (that is the \"influenza-positive\" or \"-negative\") before the drug was administered, in case (as may be with the immune response) the drug interferes with virus excretion (as the manufacturer claims in some of its literature).You also propose an analysis of those grouped by ITTI from serological conversion with those grouped by virus excretion. This also would be useful, to determine whether or not a bias exists in the current data (in either direction, as you point out -the possible mechanisms you outline are plausible). However, your hypothesis \"If oseltamivir is most beneficial in preventing lower respiratory tract (LRT) complications\" IS one of the main issues to be confirmed. As already described in our review, you reported a reduction of cytokine production in response to influenza infection by oseltamivir in humans: This was central to the start of our unease, after it was pointed out to us (in this Feedback section!) by Hayashi that over half of the data in it were of unpublished trials. You state that the end-points were established a priori and not post hoc. You admit to shortcomings of the paper but point out that they were declared in the paper itself. You suggest that because the two published trials meta-analysed had no more favourable drug results than the unpublished, bias is less likely.",

And \"May I suggest that the authors either explain the reason why they felt the need to use far stricter inclusion criteria than is normal in Cochrane reviews, or revisit their inclusion criteria so that the studies can be analysed.\" Our review is the first systematic review that we are aware of to be completely based on regulatory information. As our basic element of data synthesis was different, we had to develop new methods which we did transparently and are described in the review. It was a fact that we had received partial clinical study reports for the same trials from both Roche and EMA. We felt the need to ensure these reports were consistent. Whether our methods were an \"extraordinarily high bar\" or a reasonable bar or too low a bar is a judgement readers can make for themselves. The background history which informed our methodology is explained in the review itself. At pages 4 and 5 of the review we write: \"In 2009, a reader posted a comment in response to the (then current) 2006 version of this review (Jefferson 2006) . He pointed out that the review had endorsed the claim regarding a reduction in complications based on the uncritical inclusion of the Kaiser metaanalysis (Doshi 2009). The reader pointed out that only two of the 10 'Kaiser trials' had been published (Nicholson 2000; Treanor 2000) and the information provided by the Kaiser text about the remaining eight was insufficient for their appraisal. Our subsequent efforts to retrieve and review the eight unpublished trials (representing 2691 patients) were unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the findings of our previous review were not an accurate estimate of the benefits and safety of the drug. In addition, we found clear evidence of possible publication bias (see below) amid concern that some evaluations have not been available to scrutiny by the scientific community (Cohen 2009; Doshi 2009; Freemantle 2009; Godlee 2009).\" \"This review is focused on healthy adults and children. It represents the amalgamation of two long-standing Cochrane reviews on the effects of NIs for influenza in healthy adults (Jefferson 2010a , also published as Jefferson 2009a) and children (Matheson 2007) . The reviews were combined to pool our collective expertise and time in extracting and assessing data from clinical study reports, which in the case of some oseltamivir trials, report both adult and paediatric outcomes. Cochrane reviews of NIs in both children and adults generated intense interest from clinicians and media during the influenza outbreak declared a pandemic by the WHO in 2009. The Cochrane review of NIs in healthy adults highlighted the high risk of publication bias (Jefferson 2010a) . In 2009, a reader posted a comment in response to the (then current) 2006 version of this review (Jefferson 2006) . He pointed out that the review had endorsed the claim regarding a reduction in complications based on the uncritical inclusion of the Kaiser meta-analysis (Doshi 2009).

Our attempts to reconcile published and unpublished evidence by contacting the manufacturer and study authors failed (the latter were unable to provide us with the necessary data; some were not in possession of the data and others may have been restricted by confidentiality agreements). Together with the British Medical Journal (BMJ)we ascertained that ghostwriters had been involved, which means the named authors may not have been in full control of the trial publications (Cohen 2009). We also identified several key differences in licensed indications for oseltamivir between regulatory systems (mainly between the US, Europe and Japan) and underreporting of harms. The differences are detailed elsewhere (Doshi 2009) but of particular concern was the insistence of the FDA that oseltamivir has not been shown to reduce complications (FDA 2011a). The FDA has also not allowed an indication for interference of viral transmission within households (the key concept behind post-exposure prophylaxis). This undermined our confidence in published data and in the findings of our previous Cochrane reviews. In the background of all this were suggestions that NIs may not be as safe as previously assumed, with associations between oseltamivir use and neuropsychiatric adverse reactions of particular concern (Hama 2008).\" Adam Jacobs writes: \"It is almost as if the authors have gone out of their way to exclude the evidence, which does not help to answer important questions about the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors.\" A page 5 of the review we write: \"During the preparation of the 2010 review and of the current review, we realised that there were multiple sources and different levels of granularity of clinical trial data (see 'The Scope of Clinical Trial Data' table in Jefferson 2011). We decided that clinical study reports and regulatory comments were likely to provide the least biased, most complete and most insightful set of data for our review\". And \"We identified that 60% (3145/5267) of patient data from randomised, placebo-controlled phase III treatment trials of oseltamivir have never been published. This includes M76001, the biggest treatment trial ever undertaken on oseltamivir (with just over 1400 people of all ages). Exclusion of unpublished data changed our previous findings regarding oseltamivir's ability to reduce complications of influenza (Doshi 2009; Jefferson 2009a).\" Our attempts at identifying and retrieving all available evidence from regulators and manufacturers since 2009 are documented at http://bmj.com/tamiflu. Adam Jacobs writes: \"It is also noteworthy that no specific reasons were given for exclusion of studies from stage I of the process: we are only told that \"insufficient information was available\". In the interests of transparency, it would be better to know specifically what information was lacking.\" In Table 9 (page 186) we list all studies included in Stage 1 and report details of what data for each were available to us. For, example for trial MV22940 we know that it is likely to be a randomised trial assessing effects of oseltamivir on post exposure prophylaxis but no other data are available to us. In these circumstances we cannot proceed to assessment until the information is available, as explained in the text of the review. However these studies are not excluded but are marked as pending assessment. We invite Adam Jacobs to read the review and the references which document the history of the review, background and rationale for withdrawing the original review and developing the current version. We also invite Mr Jacobs to clarify what business relation his firm has if any with Roche, GSK and BioCryst Ltd.

However GSK, the manufacturer of zanamivir, made the comment that hazard ratios may not be appropriate due to non-proportional hazards. Therefore for A159 we reported absolute treatment effects for time to alleviation of symptoms but not relative effects.

A second aim is to construct and test a tool that could be used to extract, organise and appraise study information contained in such modules.The items which are most commonly found in the M2 of the oseltamivir trials are: Certificates of Analysis (a report on the colour, composition and content of active and control substance capsules, blank Case Report Forms (case notes for each participant), follow-up cards/diary cards (on which each participant recorded information such as symptoms), informed consent text and participant contract (to be administered to and signed by each participant), lists of investigators in the trial, investigation review board, ethics committees and study sites' addresses, the Reporting Analysis Plan (Roche's term for the Statistical Analysis Plan or SAP detailing the types of data analyses to be carried out), randomisation list (used to allocate participants and the study Protocol with its amendments when appropriate or available.",

            "text": "We received 12 CSR Ms2 from 31 studies requested from EMA by July 2011. Before we reviewed Ms2 we knew they contained protocols, with their amendments, certificate of analyses, blank case report forms, randomisation and participating centres' lists. However, we had no precise idea whether this was a comprehensive list or whether further items would be identified once we started reviewing. We also noted that the same info was reported elsewhere in the CSRs (for example in the core report) but in a different level of detail. A good example of this is the statistical analysis section of the core report which is a few pages long chapter, compared to the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which is a self contained document included in M2. In addition we were not aware of the existence of any readily available tool to allow us to extract, organise and appraise the information contained in the Ms2. As consequence we decided to develop our own tool. Our plan is to do this by identifying the types of items contained in the Ms2 available to us and their location in the Ms2. The outline content of all items identified will be checked in the Ms2 because of the potential for differing titles for the same item. For example we have already noticed that Research Analysis Plan (RAP) is sometimes called Data Analysis Plan (DAP) or Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Another example are the Protocol Amendment Histories and Protocol Modification History Document. These represented different ways of identifying the same item and need to be given a single identifier. Items such as Data Reporting and Analysis Manual (DRAM) are only cited in one M2. We will also conduct a pilot to identify with certainty which items are present more frequently. We will make a list of what we thought were most present and important items contained in the Ms2 and create a grid based on the sequence of development of the trial design and analysis plan. For example, we want to track whether the reporting of the trial study design in the relevant section of the protocol and its amendments (in M2) is consistent with that described in the core report (in M1). We will also make an initial extraction frame to reconstruct the timeline of the study documents, summarising the number of protocol changes and their dates in sequence. This has the purpose of giving an overview of the main timeline points of the key items of study design and analysis. We will then pilot our extraction sheet and make changes following discussion with all authors. We will extract the data in the same groups we worked in the original review. We will define the impact of adding M2 information by measuring the change in risk of bias (ROB) assessment in our review as well as reporting our summary description and appraisal of each trial before and after addition of the data and comparing it with the manufacturer's assessment. The detailed questions addressed by our analysis are:1. Does addition of M2 to M1 change the risk of bias evaluation compared to M1 alone? 2. Does reading M2 and M1 in CSRs change the risk of bias evaluation compared to using published papers? 3. Is the current risk of bias tool adequate for assessing trials based on reading M2 then M1 in the CSRs? 4. Does reading M2 and M1 in the CSRs identify additional useful relevant information for systematically reviewing a trial programme? We will primarily use descriptive methods to answer the questions. To answer question 1 we will compare the risk of bias in our 2012 review with risk identified after addition of M2 information to our current review using a 3 by 3 contingency table. We will repeat this procedure to answer question 2, by comparing risk of bias in our 2009 BMJ review to our current assessment. This analysis will be based on the subset of trials that were published and included in our 2009 review. To answer question 3 we will list all the components of other risk of bias in the current review and compared these with previous reviews (2012 and 2009 ). To answer the final question we will provide a summary of the items that were identified in our assessment of the trials using the new M2 tool. This will allow us to summarise discrepancies between what was planned in the protocol, what was carried out (RAP, protocol amendments), what was reported in M1, and what was reported in the published papers. The focus would be on the trial programme of research i.e. issues that appeared consistently over the trials.",

Lab-confirmed diagnosis (e.g. based on radiological or microbiologically confirmed evidence of infection). b. Clinical diagnosis without laboratory confirmation (diagnosed by a doctor after a clinical examination). c. Other type of diagnosis such as self-reported by patient *A separate section provides the details of our proposed analysis of harms. The main outcome of interest is any symptomatic influenza-like-illness (ILI). However, we will also conduct separate analyses of influenza (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and non-influenza ILI. Can Cochrance compare their results on influenza neuraminidase inhibitors with the reduction in symptoms when penicillin is given for strep throat? I think they may be comparable. That would be an important perspective.

            "text": "Dear Dr Gross, the Cochrane Collaboration and specifically our ARI Group could certainly design a review looking at the comparative evidence of the effects of neuraminidase inhibitors versus penicillin for sore throat. Both reviews are in the ARI Group's Module, so it would have to be an indirect comparison review. I am not sure there are any of those in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, but there's always a first time for everything as our regulatory evidence review shows. It would have to be a new review, with a new protocol, perhaps with new authors. Would you be interested? All the clinical study reports for the two neuraminidase inhibitors we looked at are at: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.77471 and a short introduction at: blog post http://blog.datadryad.org/2014/04/17/tamiflu-data/ With best wishes, Tom Jefferson on behalf of the authors We wrote, with respect to oseltamivir being used for the prevention of influenza, that \"oseltamivir caused headaches and psychiatric harms in adult prophylaxis trials\" (p.38). The degree to which the risk of psychiatric harms is increased is somewhere between 1 additional psychiatric adverse event for every 36 to 1538 persons that received oseltamivir for the prevention of influenza (p.3). While our Review \"failed to identify a clear association between oseltamivir and psychiatric harms\" (p.38) in clinical trials in which oseltamivir was being used for the treatment of influenza, this does not rule out the possibility that a causal relationship exists. It only states that we did not detect one. We wrote: \"The question of why oseltamivir treatment trials failed to identify a clear association between oseltamivir and psychiatric harms, although a weak dose-dependent association was observed, is a moot point. It is possible that influenza-like illness and influenza symptoms masked the harms in those who were already symptomatic and therefore recruited in the treatment trials (and influenza-type symptoms were excluded as adverse events to be reported). The reporting issue of compliharms may have helped to mask such events. Alternatively, it could be that these events are rare in the populations studied and that there was insufficient power to detect an association. The CI [confidence interval] was wide (0.43 to 2.03) and does not rule out a doubling in risk due to treatment -as was found in the prophylaxis trials. It is also possible that the risk of psychiatric harm increases with increasing dose (as the data from trials WV15670 and WV15671 suggest) and increasing duration of treatment (as the prophylaxis trials suggest)\" (p.38). In our Review, we discuss other studies, including three prospective cohort studies in Japan, that you may wish to review (p.38), although we did not formally analyze these studies in our systematic review. A careful analysis of these studies, and other studies we did not mention in this reply, would be required to answer your question about the causal link between Tamiflu and deaths. We hope the above is helpful in responding to your query. Regards Dear authors of the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group, Neuraminidase Inhibitor Review Team. I have learnt that the Association of Victims of Tamiflu-related Encephalopathy requested the Cochrane team to establish causality between Tamiflu and abnormal/psychiatric behaviours, sudden death or serious sequelae. I know the victim's serious situations; the applications for damage relief to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) were turned down and they lost cases in law courts either. Both PMDA and law courts took the same position, saying \"there was no serious side effects in Tamiflu.\" Here, the importance of causality establishment is evident as to respond to the request by the victims' group. I remember that Cochrane collaboration started upon responding lay peoples' query. Hence, I also request the Cochrane team to focus on this issue and to establish causality between Tamiflu and abnormal/psychiatric behaviours, sudden death or sequelae. In revising the systematic review report considering the establishment of causality between Tamiflu and serious side effects, I hope that the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group, Neuraminidase Inhibitor Review Team will formally include analyses on events of \"injury and poisoning\" especially \"injury\" with Tamiflu treatment. I believe that all criteria for causal inference by Hill/US surgeon General are satisfied for both abnormal behaviour and sudden death. I thank you in advance.

We received a similar request from Ms. Ryuko Hatano on Aug 28, 2017, regarding \"abnormal behaviours, sudden death or sequelae.\" As we explain in our response to that query, these events per se did not occur at a frequency greater than 0.5% and therefore we did not meta-analyze it. The same is true of \"injury and poisoning.\" This also did not occur at a frequency greater than 0.5% and therefore we did not meta-analyze it. Please see our response to her query for more information on our methods and findings. Regards 22 July 2013 New search has been performed Searches updated. We received the last clinical study report in September 2013. Since the first publication of this review in January 2012, we have completed the review of regulatory information that became available after our original time lock. We have assessed additional evidence from oseltamivir Module 2, evidence on adverse events following exposure to neuraminidase inhibitors and clinically relevant outcomes, and crossreferenced this with the individual listings contained in Modules 3 to 5. We now hold all the relevant full clinical study reports, which we are making publicly accessible with this review 22 July 2013 New citation required and conclusions have changed In this update we found further evidence that the mode of action of oseltamivir is likely to be centrally mediated. We then carried out a toxicity assessment and found that oseltamivir has multi-system toxicity (renal, neurological, psychiatric, metabolic, gastrointestinal and immune system). ",
