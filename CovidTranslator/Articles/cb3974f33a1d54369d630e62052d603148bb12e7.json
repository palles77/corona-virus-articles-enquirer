In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that pangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin-CoV) are genetically related to both the 2019-nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from the pangolin-CoV. Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans. author/funder.

Within less than 2 months, the viruses have spread to all provinces across China and 23 additional countries. As of February 19, 2020, the epidemic has resulted in 72,532 laboratory confirmed cases, 1,872 of which were fatal.

All three animals suffered from serious respiratory diseases and failed to be rescued by the Guangdong Wildlife Rescue Center [11] (Table S2) . Through metagenomic sequencing and de novo assembling, we recovered 38 contigs ranging from 380 to 3,377 nucleotides, and the nucleotide sequence identities among the contigs from these three samples were 99.54%. Thus, we pooled sequences from three samples and assembled the draft genome of this pangolin origin coronavirus, so called pangolin-CoV-2020 (Accession No.: GWHABKW00000000), which was approximately 29,380 nucleotides, with approximately 84% coverage of the virus genome ( Figure 1a ). Strikingly, genomic analyses suggested the pangolin-CoV-2020 has a high identity with both 2019-nCoV and Bat-CoV-RaTG13, the proposed origin of the 2019-nCoV [10] (Figure 1b; Figure 1c ). The nucleotide sequence identity between pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV was 90.23% whereas the protein sequence identities for individual proteins can be up to 100% (Table S3; Table S4 ). The nucleotide sequence between pangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was 90.15%",

There was a low similarity of 72.63% between the S genes of pangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV. Nucleotide sequence analyses suggested the S gene was relatively more genetic diverse in the S1 region than the S2 region ( Figure   2a ). Furthermore, the S proteins of pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV had a sequence identity of 89.78% (Table 2) , sharing a very conserved receptor binding motif (RBM) ( Figure S1 ), which is more conserved than in Bat-CoV-RaTG13. These results support that pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV, and SARS-CoV could all share the same receptor ACE2. The presence of highly identical RBMs in pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV means that this motif was likely already present in the virus before jumping to humans. However, it is interesting that both pangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 lack a S1/S2 cleavage site (~680-690 aa) whereas 2019-nCoV possess ( Figure S1 ).",

Most recently, dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia were shown to harbor three different coronavirus species, including a dominant MERS-CoV lineage that was responsible for the outbreaks in the Middle East and South Korea during 2015 [18]. Although this present study does not support pangolins would be an intermediate host for the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, our results do not prevent the possibility that other CoVs could be circulating in pangolins. Thus, large surveillance of coronaviruses in the pangolins could improve our understanding the spectrum of coronaviruses in the pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.",
