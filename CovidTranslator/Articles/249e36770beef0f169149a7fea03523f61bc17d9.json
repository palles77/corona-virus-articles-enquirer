            "text": "It is impossible to anticipate when the next pandemic might occur or how severe its consequences might be. In the 20 th century, the pandemic of 1918 is estimated to have killed more than 40 million people; the other pandemics were milder but healthcare resources were nevertheless strained. 1 If an influenza pandemic similar to the one that struck in 1918 were to appear again, even taking into account the advances in medicine since then, an unprecedented toll of illness and death could be expected. Air travel would hasten the spread of a new virus and decrease the time available for preparing interventions. Although it is not feasible to halt the spread of a pandemic virus, it should be possible to mitigate its consequences through regional and national preparedness measures to meet the challenge. 2 In the post-SARS era, Taipei has established an integrated system for responding to emerging infectious diseases such as pandemic H5N1 influenza. A stepwise approach will be implemented for active surveillance, 3 epidemiologic contact tracing, and containment of cases within special isolation hospitals. 4 In phase 6 of the WHO pandemic alert where there is efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission, there may be an upsurge in the number of patients seeking medical assistance and existing medical facilities may become overwhelmed. The strategy will then be shifted to disaster response and impact minimization to maintain social order and integrity of the healthcare system. 5 In Taipei, there is a design of citywide traffic control with task forces formed by special isolation hospitals acting as contaminated hospitals. 4, 6 However, the number of influenza patients may still exceed the capacity of the assigned isolation hospitals and flood into general clean hospitals, which would jeopardize the fundamental medical structure. Therefore, establishing alternative care sites (ACS) as part of the surge capacity of isolation hospitals has long been a concern. 7,8 Recently, several articles have raised the pros and cons of a stayhome policy as a replacement for ACS. 9 However, \"expect the unexpected\" being the principle of crisis management, we should never give up on ACS. In the incidence action plan of Taipei, ACS has been integrated into phase 6 of pandemic response with the module of traffic control bundle, 6 while the concept of zones of risk has evolved into contaminated special isolation hospitals. For each working group, a contaminated hospital is ",
