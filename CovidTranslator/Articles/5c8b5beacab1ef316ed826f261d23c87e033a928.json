Of note, MPXV genetic evidence from this casepatient was closely related to UTC_1964, a strain that was isolated from an animal imported from Africa to the Rotterdam Zoo in 1966 (10) . Because the reservoir species of MPXV remains unknown, we hypothesize that our casepatient was probably infected by exposure to wild animals and not from MPXV imported to Sierra Leone from Central Africa.

In addition to dogs, several wild mammals have been found infected by L. infantum in rural environments in Europe (2) . With regard to the epidemiologic factors promoting infection with Leishmania, the appearance of new animal reservoirs besides dogs has been highlighted (1) . In this context, only a few studies examine the possible reservoir role of synanthropic animals in cities, where the role of certain domestic mammals has been analyzed exclusively (1) .Because human leishmaniasis is endemic in Barcelona, Spain (3), we investigated and quantified the presence of L. infantum in an urban population of the Norway rat, Rattus norvegicus, using a highly sensitive quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for Leishmania DNA detection. Rat leishmaniasis could complicate the epidemiologic situation of human and canine leishmaniasis, considering that the Norway rat is the most widespread mammal in the world after humans and also the most abundant animal in cities.We trapped 98 Norway rats, 84 in the sewage system and 14 in parks, during the winter of 2016-17 in a rodent surveillance and control program in Barcelona (permission no. SF/044 obtained from the regional government of Catalonia). We treated the rats according to Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and Council decision of September 22, 2010. We obtained DNA from 10 mg of spleen using the Purification of Total DNA Kit (QIAGEN, https://www.qiagen.com), following the manufacturer's instructions. We processed the samples whose DNA concentration was too low with the extraction kit by the phenol-chloroform-isoamyl (25:24:1) DNA extraction technique. We quantified the parasite DNA by qPCR using Taqman probe with Fam fluorochrome (4).Only 1 rat (7.1%) captured in the parks tested positive for L. infantum. However, rats captured in the sewage system showed a 33.3% prevalence (28/84) of L. infantum infection. The estimated number of parasites in the positive samples from spleens varied considerably, ranging from 0.28 to >2,200 (Table) . Histologic sections of positive spleens were stained by Giemsa and by the streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex immunohistochemical method (5) (Appendix Figure, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/ EID/article/25/6/18-1027-App1.pdf).The low number of infected Norway rats found in Mediterranean countries in Europe so far has led to the species being categorized as an incidental host, capable of becoming infected but considered irrelevant to the longterm persistence of the disease (2,6-8). However, our study demonstrates the importance of the trapping site for finding a large Leishmania-infected rat population.According to the World Health Organization, the incrimination of a particular mammal as a Leishmania reservoir must depend on an accumulation of evidence (9) . First, the reservoir must be sufficiently abundant",
