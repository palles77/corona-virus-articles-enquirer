The aim of this first-in-man study was to determine the effect of delta inulin adjuvant on the safety and immunogenicity of a reduced dose seasonal influenza vaccine. Healthy male and female adults aged 18-65 years were recruited to participate in a randomized controlled study to compare the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a reduced-dose 2007 Southern Hemisphere trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine formulated with Advax TM delta inulin adjuvant (LTIV + Adj) when compared to a full-dose of the standard TIV vaccine which does not contain an adjuvant. LTIV + Adj provided equivalent immunogenicity to standard TIV vaccine as assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays against each vaccine strain as well as against a number of heterosubtypic strains. HI responses were sustained at 3 months post-immunisation in both groups. Antibody landscapes against a large panel of H3N2 influenza viruses showed distinct age effects whereby subjects over 40 years old had a bimodal baseline HI distribution pattern, with the highest HI titers against the very oldest H3N2 isolates and with a second HI peak against influenza isolates from the last 5-10 years. By contrast, subjects >40 years had a unimodal baseline HI distribution with peak recognition of H3N2 isolates from approximately 20 years ago. The reduced dose TIV vaccine containing Advax adjuvant was well tolerated and no safety issues were identified. Hence, delta inulin may be a useful adjuvant for use in seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccines.",

A restriction to the routine use of seasonal influenza vaccines in the developing world is the relatively high cost, reflecting the logistics of producing large quantities of influenza virus in eggs or cell-culture. We hypothesized that adjuvant addition per-mits antigen dose-sparing and thereby cost of influenza vaccines, making them more affordable and providing support for design of low-dose future pandemic influenza vaccines.",

The study was approved by the Flinders Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Exclusions included pregnancy, immuno-suppressive therapy, diabetes mellitus, any immunodeficiency disorder, oral corticosteroids, HIV infection, drug or alcohol abuse, history of vaccine or egg allergy, or prior receipt of a 2007 seasonal influenza vaccine. In the initial stage of the study, subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either a standard full-dose TIV vaccine (45 lg HA) or a 1/3rd dose of the same TIV antigen (15 lg HA) formulated with 20 mg Advax TM delta inulin adjuvant. After completion of these initial study arms, subjects were also recruited into a 1/10th TIV dose (4.5 lg HA) + Advax adjuvant arm. After signed informed consent, randomisation and venesection for baseline serology, a single vaccine dose was administered by intramuscular injection of 0.5 ml vaccine into the non-dominant deltoid muscle. At 1, 3 and 12 weeks postimmunization blood was obtained to assess the anti-influenza immune response.",

Individual antibody landscapes are influenced by the subject's age and past exposures to influenza infection and/or immunisation, but average group responses can give a robust comparison of the response to different vaccination strains. Although previously used to compare responses between differing vaccine strains, the effect that an adjuvant may have on the global antibody responses to influenza has never been analyzed in this way. We therefore sought to compare in a subset of 70 trial subjects (those aged 60 years or less) the complete HI antigenic map against 81 different H3N2 viruses, with the oldest dating back to the first H3N2 strains to infect humans in 1968. At baseline preimmunisation HI titers against the 81 H3N2 viruses were similar in the two vaccine groups, with the exception that the standard TIV group had slightly higher levels of reactivity against the very oldest H3N2 strains (Fig. 3 & Supporting online material). When subjects were analyzed by age > or 640 years, marked differences in the pattern of baseline HI titers were seen (Supporting online material). As would be expected due to different exposure histories, in both sets of vaccine recipients the older group showed higher titers against the oldest A/H3N2 strains tested. However, titers against more recent viruses were significantly higher in the 640 year age category -a pattern not so easily attributable to different exposure histories. Notably, subjects >40 years old had a bimodal baseline HI distribution pattern, with the highest baseline HI titers against the very oldest H3N2 isolates and with a second HI peak against influenza isolates from the last 5-10 years. By contrast, subjects <40 years had a unimodal baseline HI distribution with peak recognition of H3N2 isolates from approximately 20 years ago (Supporting online material).",

            "text": "The current study was undertaken to assess the safety and dose-sparing capability of Advax, a novel delta inulin-based polysaccharide adjuvant. This was the first time Advax adjuvant was tested in humans with a seasonal TIV vaccine. Vaccine formulated with Advax adjuvant remained immunogenic even when reduced to 1/3rd or even 1/10th the standard TIV dose. Whilst HI titers are regarded as the best predictor of influenza protection, ELISA assays provide an opportunity to explore effects on antibody isotypes. Interestingly, although LTIV(1/3rd) + Adj was associated with significantly lower anti-influenza IgM levels at both 7-and 21-dpv, this did not translate into lower IgG or HI titers. As LTIV without adjuvant was not included as a study arm, it is not possible to say whether the lower IgM response might have been due to the lower vaccine dose and/or the presence of the Advax adjuvant. Previous analysis of vaccination responses across antigenic space through the use of antibody landscapes revealed that a large part of the antibody response to influenza vaccination appears to be a result of surprisingly extensive recall of prior immunity, termed ''backboosting\" [19] . This study corroborates these findings, with detectable vaccination responses reaching back all the way to the very oldest influenza A/H3N2 strains in both study groups. It was previously unknown what the effect of an adjuvant would be on such phenomena, whether it would for example favor responses against novel or future strains or disproportionately increase the backboosting effect and responses against older strains. The findings from this study indicate that neither is strongly favored and all responses were maintained by the addition of adjuvant despite a reduced antigen dose. The baseline pre-immunisation antibody landscapes, clearly demonstrated the impact of past influenza exposures on each individual's pattern of HI titers, with older HI responses to vaccine strains are shaded in gray and to variant strains in white. GMT increase shown as fold change relative to baseline. subjects most likely to recognise the oldest H3N2 variants. Why older individuals should have lower baseline titers against more recent strains is less clear however and may represent the decay of antibody titers over time. Indeed, some sera from elderly individuals showed very little detectable antibody reactivity to any of the 81 strains, despite having lived through four decades of A/ H3N2 circulation. The fact that no differences were seen between age groups is reassuring support of the efficacy of the LTIV + Adj but may also be influenced by the lack of very elderly individuals in the study. As such it would be informative to use antibody landscapes to examine the effect of adjuvanted vaccines in such recipients, where phenomena such as immune-senescence may play a larger role. Enhanced vaccine immunogenicity or antigen-sparing should not be at the expense of tolerability or safety. The only currently approved adjuvanted TIV vaccines contain squalene oil emulsion formulations (MF59 adjuvant) approved for use in the elderly [21] . TIV vaccines containing MF59 adjuvant have been extensively studied and shown to enhance vaccines immunogenicity in both the elderly and in young children. Whilst MF59 adjuvant has a well recognised propensity to cause modestly increased injection site pain and muscle aches, meta-analyses have confirmed its positive safety profile [22] . This includes a lack of association of MF59adjuvanted vaccines with an increased risk of narcolepsy in immunised subjects [23] , a finding of high importance given the increased narcolepsy seen in children immunized with the H1N1/2009pdm vaccine (Pandemrix \u00d2 , GSK, Belgium) adjuvanted with AS03, a squalene-based adjuvant that also contains tocopherol [24] . Despite the well-demonstrated benefits of adjuvants for vaccine immunogenicity, the high level of community apprehension regarding adjuvant safety needs to be acknowledged and considerable consumer education is likely to be required to successfully introduce any new adjuvant into the seasonal influenza market.",

Larger studies with reduced TIV alone control groups will be required to exactly quantitate Advax's antigen-sparing effects. Another limitation is that measurement of HI responses is not a perfect predictor of influenza protection. influenza-specific CD4 T cells have recently being shown in human studies to be predictive of influenza protection [28, 29] . It will be important to measure the effect of Advax adjuvant on T-cell responses in future studies.
