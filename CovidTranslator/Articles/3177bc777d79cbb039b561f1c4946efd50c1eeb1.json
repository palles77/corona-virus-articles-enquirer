Worldwide, 1 vaccination programs are currently estimated to save over 3 million lives each year. In addition to having a major beneficial impact on vaccine-preventable disease morbidity and mortality, the direct and indirect impacts of vaccination programs translate into economic savings of many billions of dollars each year. In what is considered to be one of history's most significant medical successes, a collaborative and comprehensive vaccination campaign against smallpox resulted in the global eradication of the disease in 1979. 2 Similarly, efforts to eradicate poliomyelitis have made tremendous progress in reducing the global disease burden, and will hopefully soon overcome certain residual societal and programmatic obstacles to provide the second successful example of elimination of a major health threat by vaccination. Concerted global efforts to provide measles vaccine have resulted in the control and elimination of the disease in many countries, including substantial reductions in mortality in a number of developing countries where the residual disease burden is greatest. These and other examples provide clear evidence of the power of vaccines in favorably manipulating host immunity to confer dramatic public health benefits, at both the individual and population level.",

            "text": "Vaccines are administered to healthy individuals (often to entire age cohorts or populations), to prevent diseases caused by infectious agents to which they might be exposed in the future. Thus, they differ in important ways from pharmacologic agents that are used to treat individuals in whom a disease process is already manifest (or who display predispositions to disease). For this reason, vaccines are unique in the way that they impact on societies and in the way that societal commitment to vaccination determines their ultimate impact. As a result, vaccination efforts provide an informative window on challenges that need to be successfully navigated at the interface between scientific opportunity and societal capacity and commitment. Indeed, current limitations in realizing the full global potential of available vaccines relate more to existing inadequacies in health care financing and infrastructure (especially as they are manifest in developing countries), and the relative value that societies place on disease prevention, than they do to any inherent biological limitations of vaccines themselves. Following the initiation of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 1974, global coverage for routine vaccines (such as three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DPT3)) has progressively increased, but many children in resource-limited countries still fail to receive all recommended childhood immunizations. Fortunately, recent acceleration of new vaccine introductions in developing countries through public and private initiatives (such as the GAVI Alliance and UNICEF) to build immunization infrastructure and provide funding of vaccine purchase (including novel funding mechanisms for vaccine procurement such as the Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and the International Financing Facility for Immunization (IFFIm)) offers hope that vaccines will one day be equitably available to all who need them. Achieving this aspiration represents the focus of a recently launched initiative referred to as the Decade of Vaccines Collaboration (http:// www.dovcollaboration.org).",

The history of vaccine development is rich with immunologic insights that emerged from careful observations of how diseases spread in populations and how such spread differs in disease-na\u00efve and experienced populations, as well as of how innovative experimental approaches revealed fundamental aspects of immune system function. The general concept of immunity induced by prior exposure to a disease (including its specificity and potential lifelong duration) was appreciated by the ancient Greeks. Use of the word \"immunity\" in the context of human health dates to the fourteenth century when it was applied to describe the relative susceptibility and resistance of populations to plague. The subsequent successes of Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur in the development of effective smallpox and fowl cholera immunization strategies, respectively, provided a foundation for modern immunology; Pasteur himself coined the term \"vaccine\" in recognition of Jenner's use of vaccinia virus. Jenner's smallpox immunization studies also provided early experimental support for the concept of immune memory. Pasteur's efforts provided the first demonstration of the attenuation of pathogens by their propagation in culture (or by passage in nonnatural animal hosts), while Robert Koch demonstrated that killed pathogens could also engender immunity. The discovery of bacterial exotoxins by Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin facilitated the discovery of antibodies and their potential use in passive immunotherapy with antitoxin antibodies by Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato. These discoveries enabled the development of active immunization against diphtheria and tetanus using toxin-antitoxin mixtures. Paul Ehrlich's development of accurate methods for antibody quantitation made passive immunotherapy and active toxin-antitoxin immunization far more reliable and effective, and provided a stimulus for significant advances in immunologic theory. In each of these instances, vaccine development illuminated central mechanisms of immune system biology.",

There exist tremendous public health needs to address major well-known pandemic diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis, and malaria, for which no effective vaccines currently exist and for which natural immunity does not provide a helpful guide for vaccine development. Furthermore, there exists a need to confront effectively newly emerging and re-emerging diseases, ranging from the well-known, but constantly changing, threats from influenza pandemics to the appearance of previously unknown zoonotic infections such as the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). With changes in population density, mobility, and social constructs, along with alterations in the global climate, ecological circumstances, and the proximity of humans to animal reservoirs for previously confined infectious agents, the concept of new infectious agents entering human populations and spreading rapidly around the world is no longer novel. In confronting prevalent or newly emerging diseases, vaccines are looked to as the most promising line of defense. However, the speed at which new infectious disease threats emerge and spread, and the fact that the pathogens that now need to be confronted may display tremendous genetic variability (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) or an identity that cannot now be predicted in advance (e.g., avian influenza or emerging zoonotic infectious agents like the SARS coronavirus) places unprecedented demands on the vaccine development process.",

            "text": "Analysis of the impact of vaccination programs in the USA provides an example of the beneficial impact of vaccines when used routinely and when high coverage levels are achieved. 6 Numerous vaccines targeting important infectious diseases have been developed since tetanus toxoid-the first vaccine licensed in the USA-was introduced in 1943. Once these vaccines were introduced into routine vaccination programs in the USA the annual morbidity of many vaccine-preventable diseases dramatically decreased (Table 90 .1). In many instances, the disease burden from several vaccine-preventable diseases of childhood has been reduced by over 99% since vaccine introduction (e.g., diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, and polio). The somewhat lower rate of decline of pertussis (the annual morbidity of which has been reduced by a nonetheless impressive 86%) relates to the limited duration of vaccine-induced immunity, which is estimated to wane within 5-10 years after childhood vaccination. It is anticipated that recent availability of pertussis booster vaccines for use in adolescents and adults will lead to significant further declines in pertussis morbidity. Even for diseases targeted by vaccines that have been in widespread use for less time, impressive decreases in disease morbidity have been seen (e.g., varicella, hepatitis A, pneumococcal and rotavirus diseases). In a notable recent demonstration of the population benefits of vaccines, introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) resulted in a decrease of 94% in rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children under 5 years of age within the first 7 years of its introduction, with infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae also falling dramatically in this age group. 7 In a striking related finding illustrating how vaccines can impact pathogen transmission dynamics, IPD rates also decreased significantly in non-vaccinated children, as well as in individuals over the age of 65 who had not received the vaccine. Thus, direct protection by vaccination of children who represent a reservoir of infection provided, via herd immunity, significant indirect benefits to those who did not themselves receive the vaccine. In another manifestation of the impact of vaccination on the dynamics of pathogen transmission, rates of IPD caused by serotypes not included in PCV-7 (especially 19A) have increased, but remain low compared to the decreases in PCV-7-type IPD. To address this dynamic and provide even broader protection against pneumococcal disease, vaccines of higher valency (10-valent and 13-valent PCVs) have been introduced recently. In addition to their benefits in preventing disease morbidity and mortality, routine vaccination programs are also impressively cost-effective. Evaluation in the USA of the impact of ten vaccines routinely given as part of the childhood immunization schedule (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib), polio; measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B and varicella) found that more than 20 million cases of disease and more than 42 000 deaths were averted over the lifetime of the immunized birth cohort of children. When the cost of the vaccination program was compared to the economic impact of diseases prevented, these vaccines alone are estimated to save nearly $14 billion each year. When including indirect economic benefits (such as the time parents take off from work to care for sick children), the annual savings to society exceed $69 billion. When 30 preventive services were ranked based on clinically preventable disease burden and cost-effectiveness, childhood immunization received the highest score. 8 Progress in the development of new vaccines accelerated significantly towards the end of the twentieth century, with the development of vaccines against diseases that were not previously preventable by vaccination, but also with the development of improved versions of existing vaccines. Thus, the number of diseases that can be prevented by vaccines included in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) routine childhood and adolescent immunization schedules grew from 7 in 1985 to 16 by 2007 (Table 90. 2 and Appendix A5, and see http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/default.htm). While expanded recommendations for some of these vaccines in children and adolescents have been introduced since 2007 (such as broader use of the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4), and the recommendation for routine use of the quadrivalent human papilloma virus vaccine (HPV4) in males), the number of targeted diseases remains constant for these age groups as of 2012. Moreover, in the past several years, new vaccines have been introduced for adolescents and young adults (e.g., pertussis booster (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines), and older adults (e.g., Tdap and zoster vaccines) have shown that the value of vaccines extends across the human lifespan. New combination vaccines have been developed to increase the simplicity and acceptability of vaccination regimens, as well as to improve overall compliance with the recommended series of vaccines. Such combinations include either those that contain multiple inactivated or recombinant antigens (such as a combination diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Hib, and hepatitis B vaccine) or multiple live attenuated viruses (such as a combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV)). The development of a combination vaccine is often more complicated than simply combining individual antigens, for when antigens are administered in combination, immunologic interference is sometimes seen. This necessitates titration of antigen combinations (and in the case of combinations of inactivated and/or recombinant antigens, adjuvant selection) to achieve immune responses that are not inferior to each of the antigens administered individually.",

However, vaccination specifically refers to efforts to induce protective immune responses by administration of a vaccine, whereas immunization more generically refers to interventions-either active or passive-that seek to confer immune protection. Active immunization describes the induction of immune responses by administration of a specific antigen or antigens, while passive immunization involves the administration of exogenous immunologically active substances (historically, antibodies present in sera obtained from immune individuals or animals) to confer temporary protection from an infectious pathogen or toxin. Although the approaches for passive immunization waned in the later half of the twentieth century, the advent and increasing robustness of monoclonal antibody technology have led to a resurgence of interest in passive immunization. Vaccines seek to engender immune responses similar to those that confer immunity to re-infection in individuals who experience (and survive) natural infection with a given pathogen. In lieu of formal demonstration of a specific type of antibody or cellular immune response that contributes to prevention or accelerated clearance of an infection, most often vaccine efficacy is demonstrated first in the course of a placebo-controlled trial. In some instances, specific immune effector mechanisms, such as a specific level or type of antibody response, can be identified that correlate with immune protection. In this case, the \"correlate of immunity\" provides a benchmark against which similar vaccines can be compared. 9 In the case of most inactivated vaccines, subunit vaccines, and recombinant vaccines that produce antibody responses, but generally limited, if any, CD8 T-cell responses, it is likely that humoral immune responses are the primary or sole protective immune mechanism. In the case of live attenuated vaccines that induce both cellular and humoral immune responses against the pathogen, it is likely that both arms of the immune system act in concert to confer immunity. However, the actual mechanisms of immune protection induced by either a natural infection or a vaccine are generally not understood in detail for many infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Similarly, although vaccines depend on the induction of immunologic memory, the magnitude, character, and duration of immune memory differ between vaccines, as can the actual mechanism of immune protection. For certain vaccines, such as those that protect against bacterial diseases induced via production of toxins (e.g., diphtheria or tetanus), protection induced by toxoid-based vaccines is clearly dependent on persistent antibody (IgG) and memory B-cell responses, ensuring that sufficient antitoxin antibodies are present at the time of toxin exposure to inactivate and clear the toxin. In other cases, such as long-lived protection against hepatitis B, if sufficient levels of antibodies are achieved in the initial immunization period, even hosts who may with time lose detectable levels of antibody responses remain protected. 10 In this instance, given the relatively long incubation period of hepatitis B, memory antiviral B-cell responses induced by the vaccine can be activated, facilitating neutralization and clearance of the infection before clinical disease is manifest. Although it is popularly believed that vaccines confer protection by inducing \"sterilizing immunity\"-wherein an infectious agent is blocked from even infecting one cell in an exposed host-this is clearly not the case for a number of vaccines. For example, the inactivated poliovirus and live attenuated rotavirus vaccines do not prevent some degree of local replication of their pathogenic counterparts in the gastrointestinal tract of exposed hosts. However, they are both effective in preventing clinical disease. In the case of poliovirus vaccine, this is mediated by elicitation of antibody responses that block dissemination of the infection to the central nervous system; while in the case of rotavirus, as yet unidentified immune effectors limit local virus replication so that significant gastrointestinal damage does not occur following infection. 11, 12 With the advent of new tools of systems biology, studies to more definitively illuminate the determinants of the magnitude and duration of vaccine-elicited immune responses (such as those that examine patterns of global gene expression induced after vaccination), as well to reveal novel correlates that predict the later development of protective immune responses, now represent a very active and promising area of research. 13, 14 In addition to providing new approaches to elucidate the nature of vaccine-mediated immune protection, these new methodologies are already providing windows into a much improved understanding of immune system function in humans and will also hopefully facilitate the development of safe and effective vaccines for diseases (such as for HIV, TB, RSV and others) for which vaccines are not currently available.",

The efficacy of many live attenuated vaccines likely reflects the ability of the attenuated vaccine to replicate within vaccinated hosts, and to expose the immune system to pathogen-derived antigens in a manner that closely resembles the nature, location, and effects of natural infection. Because live attenuated vaccines replicate within vaccinated individuals, they can induce both cellular (CD4 and CD8) and humoral (B cell) effector responses and immunologic memory.

As such, an effective but also safe and well-tolerated vaccine needs to strike a specific balance between level of attenuation and level of immunogenicity. In addition, depending on the nature and number of genetic mutations responsible for the attenuated phenotype, a potential risk of reversion to a pathogenic form exists for certain vaccines. For most live attenuated vaccines, this has not been observed to be a problem in clinical practice-likely because the attenuating mutations are sufficiently numerous or genetically stable. One vaccine where reversion to pathogenic form was seen involved specific components of the live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV; the \"Sabin vaccine\"). In this instance, vaccine reversion to wild-type was shown to lead rarely to cases of paralytic polio (approximately one case per million doses administered). 17 Based on these observations and the elimination of endogenous polio transmission in many developed countries, the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV; the \"Salk vaccine\") was substituted for OPV. However, in light of a favorable cost- benefit ratio, high degree of efficacy, and ease of administration, OPV continues to be the mainstay of polio vaccination efforts in developing countries. Yet, should efforts to eradicate polio continue to advance, new solutions for polio vaccination will need to be developed that do not depend on currently available OPV (which can revert to pathogenic form at low frequency) or IPV (which is produced by inactivation of pathogenic polioviruses strains that will require high levels of biocontainment in a post-eradication environment) vaccines.",

While this approach has the benefit of presenting most of a pathogen's antigenic repertoire to the immune system of the immunized host, it can only be used in instances where the inactivated pathogen does not possess constituents that would confer significant toxicity. Vaccines based on killed pathogens are believed to exert their protective effects via elicitation of pathogen-neutralizing antibodies and the induction of memory B-cell responses (likely in concert with CD4 T-cell memory). However, because inactivated pathogens cannot accomplish de novo synthesis of pathogenderived gene products in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), they do not typically induce CD8 T-cell responses (Chapter 6). In addition, killed vaccines are generally less immunogenic than live attenuated vaccines. As a result, they are commonly administered with an adjuvant (most often aluminium salts: see section on Adjuvants, below) to augment their immunogenicity. A number of viral and bacterial vaccines currently in use are killed/ inactivated vaccines, including whole-cell Bordetella pertussis vaccine and the influenza virus, rabies virus, and hepatitis A virus vaccines.",

Examples include Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Clostridium tetani. Detoxified versions of these toxins are referred to as \"toxoids,\" and represent the purified components of vaccines preventing diphtheria and tetanus, respectively. Toxoids have historically been produced by chemical inactivation of toxins, but more recently, genetic inactivation via targeted mutagenesis has been employed. The acellular pertussis vaccine is also a purified subunit vaccine composed of a defined set of protein constituents prepared from cultured Bordetella pertussis. The If two such segmented viruses with different genetic characteristics are used to infect one cell, the progeny viruses from this mixed infection will carry a range of mixtures of the genes of the two parent viruses. Using either genetic or immunologic screening methods, reassorted viruses carrying the precise gene composition of interest can be selected. This approach has recently been employed to generate live attenuated vaccines against rotavirus and influenza virus. The strategy for generation of the pentavalent bovine-human reassortment rotavirus vaccine is shown above. Rotaviruses have a segmented double-stranded RNA genome comprising 11 independent RNA elements. The outer shell of the virus comprises two proteins VP4 and VP7 that are involved in cell binding and entry and that specify the viral serotype (P type for VP4 and G type for VP7). VP4 and VP7 also represent the targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies. The pentavalent bovine-human rotavirus vaccine was generated by a \"modified Jennerian\" approach in which the bovine rotavirus WC3 (which is attenuated in humans as a result of host range restriction) serves as the gene donor for the backbone on to which gene segments encoding four common human rotavirus G types (G1-4) as well as one very common P type (P8) (derived from individual rotavirus isolates) were reassorted via a process of cell co-infection and subsequent selection of the recombinant viruses with the desired composition of bovine and human gene segments. An analogous genetic reassortment approach has also been used to generate live attenuated influenza vaccines. In this instance, three attenuated \"cold-adapted\" viral strains (two A types and one type B) are used in co-infections in tissue culture with recent circulating wild-type influenza strains to derive vaccine strains that include the two relevant hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)-encoding gene segments admixed with the six \"backbone\" genes from the attenuated master donor virus for use in annual influenza vaccines.",

Although such purified polysaccharides can induce protective levels of antibody responses in adults, they are poorly immunogenic in children under 2 years of age (as a function of the relative immaturity of their immune systems). In addition, T-independent antibody responses elicited by purified capsular polysaccharides are less durable than those that are produced in the presence of CD4 T-cell help. As a means of both augmenting antibody responses against polysaccharide antigens in young children and facilitating their persistence, the development of conjugate vaccines represented an important advance. 21 In this approach, purified polysaccharides are chemically conjugated to a carrier protein (such as diphtheria toxoid or an outer-membrane protein complex (OMPC) derived from N. meningitidis). The carrier protein augments CD4 T-cell helper responses to the polysaccharide antigens, and enables elicitation of durable protective antibody responses even in young children.

In addition, recombinant VLPs have been employed to derive safe and effective vaccines for pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV), that cannot be grown in culture (and are thus refractory to standard vaccine approaches of attenuation or inactivation). The generation of the VLPs that comprises newly developed HPV vaccines is shown. The HPV L1 proteins (which represent the major capsid protein and target of virus-neutralizing, protective antibodies), derived from HPV types of interest (e.g., types 16, 18, 6, and 11) are produced via recombinant methods. Under appropriate conditions, individual bioengineered L1 proteins first self-assemble into pentamers, and then into VLPs that are comprised of 72 pentamers and that are almost identical, both morphologically and antigenically, to infectious HPV virus particles.

Second, the vaccine needs to protect animals against death or disease in an appropriate challenge model, when feasible. Ideally, in the course of these studies, a specific type or level of immune response, referred to as a correlate of immune protection, can be identified. Third, the vaccine should be relatively free of serious discernible toxicities and side effects in animals when administered by the route intended for humans. Fourth, it is necessary to demonstrate that the vaccine can be produced in a consistent manner by a process that follows the current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) process by which the first clinical trial materials will be produced (http://www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/indcgmp.pdf).",

Blood samples are taken at prescribed intervals and analyzed for laboratory evidence of potential toxicity, as well as for evidence of vaccine-elicited immune responses.

In developing countries where health care resources and effective rehydration options are limited, over 600 000 infants die of rotavirus gastroenteritis each year. 28 Given the global importance of rotavirus gastroenteritis, the first licensure of an orally administered rotavirus vaccine in 1998 was a very welcome advance. However, as the vaccine entered routine pediatric practice, it was recognized that a low, but increased incidence of intestinal intussusception was seen after the first and second doses (with about one case of intussusception seen per 10 000 vaccinees). 29 Upon recognition of this association, the vaccine was withdrawn from the market. 30 With the evident public health need for a safe and effective rotavirus vaccine, it was hoped that alternative rotavirus vaccines then in development (both oral vaccines based either on a combination of bovine-human reassortant viruses ( Fig. 90. 2) or an attenuated human rotavirus strain) might differ from the first licensed rotavirus vaccine and not result in an increased rate of intussusception. However, to demonstrate that these alternative rotavirus vaccines were safe, and that an increased risk of intussusception was not inherent to rotavirus vaccines as a class, very large-scale safety studies were required. Toward this end, the safety of each of these vaccines was evaluated in studies involving about 70 000 infantsjust to evaluate whether the rate of intussusception in vaccinees was discernibly increased compared to the normal background rates seen in the placebo recipients. 11, 12 Fortunately, both vaccines were found to be well tolerated and no increase in intussusception was observed in vaccine as compared to placebo recipients. In light of the documented efficacy of these vaccines determined in earlier and significantly smaller phase III trials, both have now been licensed in a number of countries. However, even with the large phase III studies conducted for these newer rotavirus vaccines, they have been and continue to be studied in large postlicensure active surveillance safety studies and closely monitored in active and passive vaccine safety surveillance systems (see below).",

However, a number of other safety concerns that have emerged are not supported by scientific evidence. 35 An example of this can be found in the case of concerns about the association of whole-cell pertussis vaccines with permanent brain damageconcerns that were later shown to be unfounded. Nevertheless, public concerns about the safety of the whole-cell pertussis vaccine resulted in decreased levels of pertussis vaccination coverage that were soon followed by epidemics of whooping cough in the UK and Japan. 36 Another example is the allegation that certain vaccines, such as the combination measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, are associated with autism. Highlighting how perceptions of temporal association can give rise to public concerns, MMR vaccines are generally given around 1 year of age, and autism is generally diagnosed in the second year of life. Although the alleged causal association between MMR and autism has been refuted by multiple extensive scientific analyses, reports in the popular media in the UK resulted in a dramatic drop in vaccination rates, followed by an increased rate of new infections. 37, 38 The original publication in The Lancet was subsequently disavowed by the majority of the manuscript's authors 39 and then formally retracted by The Lancet's editors as a result of factual misrepresentations and ethical violations. 40, 41 While the purported association between MMR and autism has now been thoroughly discredited, this claim resulted in decreased MMR vaccination rates in a number of countries as a result of some parents delaying or refusing measles vaccination. With an increase in the number of geographic clusters of unvaccinated children, rates of endemic measles infections have recently increased in several countries in Europe (with a spill-over effect of nearly all of the rare cases of measles reported in the USA having originated from US travelers visiting endemic countries or immigrants from them).

The reasons underlying the lack of effective vaccines for an array of important pathogens include biological considerations, safety concerns, and practical constraints. Of these, the biological considerations are often the most important barrier. As discussed above, vaccines have been successfully developed for pathogens whose natural infections give rise to natural immunity wherein the infected host (at least those who survive initial infection) is no longer susceptible to re-infection (such as measles, yellow fever virus, or smallpox) or who experiences significantly less severe clinical sequelae upon re-infection (such as rotavirus). In instances where natural immunity follows natural infection, not only is a precedent for immune protection established, but the nature of protective host responses can be studied, providing a correlate of protection to guide vaccine development efforts. However, for many of the pathogens for which vaccines remain elusive, natural immunity does not follow natural infection. In the absence of natural immunity, not only is a precedent for successful immune containment lacking, but no potential correlates of protection are available to inform vaccine development. In some instances where natural immunity does not follow natural infection, persistent infections are established and maintained by active virus replication that cannot be controlled or cleared by host immune responses (such as HIV and hepatitis C).",

In other instances, even when the host is cleared of an infection via drug treatment, the host remains susceptible to re-infection and disease in the future (e.g., malaria). Although different pathogens have evolved diverse strategies for evasion of host immune responses-ranging from manifestation of tremendous genetic diversity and propensity for immune escape; to sequestration of critical structural domains that might be susceptible to antibody neutralization; to the utilization of specific mechanisms to evade host innate and adaptive immune effectors-the common end result is frustration of vaccine development.",

            "text": "While failure of host clearance of an infection is a common theme underlying the lack of vaccines, additional obstacles to vaccine development include other immunologically related considerations as well as both practical and safety considerations. Examples of immunologically related obstacles include instances where prior exposure to a given pathogen predisposes the host to more severe disease manifestations upon re-infection (as has been proposed in the case of dengue virus) or where earlier vaccine development efforts inadvertently led to severe adverse events following infection with the targeted pathogen (such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)). In each of these cases, the adverse events that follow a secondary immune exposure are believed to be the result of immunopathologic responses that result from the nature of the immune response elicited by the initial exposure to pathogen-derived antigens (by either infection or vaccination). Given that the mechanisms underlying these immunopathologic processes are incompletely understood, the development of vaccines that are highly immunogenic but not similarly inclined to elicit immune-mediated adverse consequences represents a substantial challenge (especially given the very high expectations for vaccine safety). An additional immunologically related challenge relates to the observation that certain organisms encode antigens that resemble constituents of the human host. For example, in the case of Neisseria meningitidis group B, the bacterial polysaccharide resembles those found on certain human cell lineages, thus raising concerns about whether polysaccharide-based vaccines successfully developed for group B N. meningitidis might yield undesirable autoimmune responses. 42 An additional distinct, but important, practical barrier to new vaccine development relates to the prevention of diseases that are threats to pregnant women or their offspring (where immunization of the pregnant woman might be able to protect the neonate). Although a number of inactivated vaccines are either routinely recommended for use in pregnant women (e.g., inactivated influenza vaccine) or can be used in pregnant women for pre-or postexposure prophylaxis for those at risk of infection (e.g., inactivated hepatitis A vaccine and recombinant HBsAg vaccine), the development of new vaccines specifically for use in pregnant women or the study of new vaccines in pregnant women has been impeded by concerns arising from potential litigation that might follow the appearance of a congenital abnormality in a child born to a mother who was vaccinated while pregnant. 43 Given the 2-3% prevalence of congenital abnormalities, the practical difficulties in proving the safety of a new vaccine specifically administered to pregnant women, and the current litigious environment surrounding vaccines, the development of new vaccines to address important infections of pregnant women and their neonates (e.g., group B streptococcus: GBS) faces significant challenges. However, recently strengthened recommendations for vaccination of pregnant women with influenza vaccine, and compelling evidence of its benefits, may help to foster increased attention to overcoming existing obstacles to the development and appropriate use of vaccines for pregnant women.",

Current research and development efforts are focusing on the derivation of flu vaccine approaches that would have much greater speed and reliability of production soon after recognition of emergence of a new strain; that would be more readily produced at a scale to enable global access; that would engender increased breadth of coverage to protect against diverse influenza strains; and that would be more immunogenic and efficacious in vulnerable populations (such as the elderly) who often respond poorly to currently available vaccines.

Most of the currently deployed influenza vaccines continue to be manufactured according to this 60-70 year old process.

Yet, HIV infection represents a vexing challenge to vaccine development. 55, 56 HIV establishes a chronic, persistent infection that cannot be cleared by host immune responses. Following infection of target cells, the genome of HIV-a retrovirus-is transcribed into a DNA copy via the action of reverse transcriptase. The newly formed DNA copy of the HIV genome then integrates into the host cell chromosomes (referred to as a provirus) as a requisite step in the viral lifecycle. Once integrated into the chromosome of an infected cell, the HIV provirus can alternatively be actively transcribed, leading to the synthesis of viral mRNAs and subsequently to production of new virus particles, or it can remain in a transcriptionally silent, functionally latent state in a small percentage of infected cells. As infected cells harboring latent HIV proviruses do not produce HIV protein antigens, they cannot be recognized by host antiviral immune responses and can thereby persist undetected. Upon subsequent activation of latently infected cells at some later time, viral RNA transcription can be coincidently activated leading to production of progeny virions.",

            "text": "Given the inability, to date, of candidate HIV Env-based vaccines to elicit appreciable levels of neutralizing antibodies and the failure of initial Phase III studies of gp120-based vaccines, vaccine strategies subsequently became largely focused on the induction of CD8 cytotoxic T-cell responses against the more constrained and conserved antigens, such as gag, pol, and nef. It was hypothesized that induction of high levels of HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses prior to infection may not prevent infection, but may enable infected individuals to control virus replication better. Should this hypothesis be valid, individuals immunized with such vaccines may exhibit lower levels of ongoing HIV replication, progress to AIDS more slowly, and potentially be less likely to transmit HIV infection to others. Much of this work targeting elicitation of CD8 T cell responses against HIV involves vectored gene delivery systems (such as adenoviral vectors, described below). However, the results of the first phase IIb \"test of concept study\" 59 (The Step Study) to examine this hypothesis failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on either prevention of infection or reduction of viral load among volunteers who received the vaccine despite the induction of appreciable levels of HIV-specific CTL responses by the recombinant adenovirus-based (Ad5) vaccine employed (and was accompanied by a suggestion of increased risk of HIV acquisition in uncircumcised men with evidence of prior Ad5 infection). While this study result does not, in and of itself, refute the \"CTL hypothesis\", it represented a significant disappointment for the AIDS vaccine research effort, and raised important questions about the ability of vaccine-elicited cell mediated immune responses to favorably alter the outcome of HIV infection. 60 While the test of concept study above was in progress, a Phase III study in Thailand, the RV144 study 61 was under way. This vaccine based on priming with a canarypox vector (ALVAC) encoding the gag-pol-rev-nef antigens followed by boosting with a recombinant gp120 Env glycoprotein yielded an approximately 31% reduction in infection. The vaccine had no impact on levels of post-infection viral load. The level of vaccine efficacy in this study was quite modest, and appeared to diminish with time. Realization of even this modest protective effect was unexpected, given that the gp120 immunogen used does not elicit neutralizing antibodies and had failed when delivered alone in two previous efficacy trials, and that the ALVAC-HIV vector had been found to elicit only low levels of cellular immune responses in immunized volunteers. To date, a clear correlate of protective immune responses has not been identified in the RV144 study, but its results have raised the possibility of protective effects of non-neutralizing antibodies and a preponderance of IgG antibody over IgA. 62 Efforts are currently underway to initiate additional trials seeking to replicate the results of the RV144 study, and to help identify a potential correlate of protection in regions of the world where a greater degree of viral genetic diversity is seen and where the incidence rate of HIV infection is higher.",

In addition to direct morbidity and mortality, malaria is responsible for debilitating illness with enormous social and economic consequences. Of the four malaria-associated protozoal species, Plasmodium flaciparum and P. vivax represent the two major agents. These parasites have a three-stage lifecycle taking place both within the mosquito, and in the liver and blood of the infected host, and each cycle is largely distinct from the others from an immunological perspective. As a result of the multiple strategies for evasion of host immune response that the parasite has evolved, parasite replication proceeds at high levels despite active host immune responses. 67, 68 Either as a result of these specific immune evasion strategies or the inability of the infected human host to mount immune responses that clear the parasite, prior infection does not protect an individual from repeated subsequent infections. Although the severity of disease is often attenuated following repeated infection, the mechanism of disease modulation is incompletely understood, and the limited relative immunity engendered by prior infection is easily lost if an individual leaves a malaria-endemic region. As such, the limited impact and duration of host immune responses to malaria parasites suggest that any successful vaccine strategy will need to do far better than natural immune responses-a high bar for efforts to develop an effective vaccine.",

Furthermore, the interface of HIV infection and its attendant immune system damage both increases the severity of M. tuberculosis infection and increases the infectiousness of infected individuals. The emergence and dissemination of M. tuberculosis isolates that are resistant to multiple antimicrobial drugs represent a growing public health threat. However, while the need for a vaccine to prevent tuberculosis is clear, a significant number of challenges face vaccine development efforts. 76 Most individuals infected with M. tuberculosis can control the acute phase of mycobacterial replication, and mount vigorous innate and adaptive immune responses to the infection. However, the infection is often not cleared by the host's immune response, and the mycobacteria are able to persist and multiply within vacuoles inside macrophages. Long-term latency is established in fibrotic cysts in the lung. The recrudescence and dissemination of M. tuberculosis occur at a later time in a number of infected individuals, likely as a result of waning host immune control. Although the ability of M. tuberculosis to persist despite active immune responses represents a major challenge to vaccine development, the fact that most individuals can contain (if not clear) M. tuberculosis infection suggests that a vaccine that can alter the course of the natural infection by limiting early dissemination and decreasing the risk of later recrudescence could provide major public health benefits.",

Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (better known as BCG), based on Mycobacterium bovis, was first introduced in 1921. 77 Currently, BCG is provided as a component of the routine Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI) schedule and is administered to a significant majority of the world's children. Although some protective efficacy (50-80%) has been reported against miliary infection and M. tuberculosis meningitis in children, conflicting results have been obtained in different studies regarding the ability of BCG to protect against pulmonary tuberculosis in adults. One explanation for the overall limited efficacy of BCG emerges from formal genome sequencing studies that have disclosed significant differences between M. tuberculosis and of the vaccine strain of BCG. The variability in the results of BCG efficacy studies in different populations and geographies may derive from variations in the geographic prevalence of cross-reactive mycobacterial species (that may themselves confer partial protection), or the fact that BCG vaccines used throughout the world do not represent a homogenous preparation-with the root strain of BCG having been widely distributed and passaged extensively under diverse conditions. Vaccine efforts against tuberculosis have primarily focused on the evaluation of specific mycobacterial antigens (e.g., ESAT6, Ag85, and HSP60) that have been tested as vaccines in animal models with variable success. 78, 79 Some of these strategies are now being advanced into human clinical trials. A number of these antigens are being explored, often delivered by viral vectors, as ways of boosting the protective efficacy of BCG in individuals who have previously been vaccinated with BCG. The results of one such \"proof of concept\" study of a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector encoding the M. tuberculosis antigen 85A as a booster immunization in infants who had received the BCG vaccine are slated to be available in late 2012. An alternative vaccine strategy is based on improving the performance of the BCG vaccine by insertion of genes encoding specific potential protective antigens that it normally lacks. In addition, the development of auxotrophic mutants of M. tuberculosis is being explored as a potential immunogenic and specifically attenuated live vaccine. The determination of the sequence of the M. tuberculosis genome nearly a decade ago helped identify numerous previously unknown gene products, and increased the repertoire of antigens to be evaluated for their ability to induce protective immune responses. 80 The pathogen sequence is also being used to elucidate virulence determinants and thereby help guide efforts to attenuate M. tuberculosis rationally.",

However, on subsequent natural exposure to RSV, vaccine recipients exhibited more frequent and \u2022 90 PART TEN \u2022 Prevention and therapy of immunologic diseases significantly more severe lower respiratory tract RSV infections than did unimmunized children.

(Passive protection against RSV is available for premature infants in the form of monoclonal antibodies that target the RSV F protein (one of the viral envelope glycoproteins); as such, certain anti-RSV antibody responses can clearly mediate protective as opposed to deleterious effects. 70 ) Alternatively, or in addition, it has been proposed that inactivated RSV vaccines may have preferentially induced a Th2-type immune response when a Th1-type response may be needed to effect protection of the lower respiratory tract from RSV infection and damage.",

Current work to develop a Men B vaccine centers on a handful of relatively well-conserved surface proteins of meningococcus. 86, 87 Many of these antigens have been identified by \"reverse vaccinology\", and indeed, a Men B vaccine candidate currently in the late stages of clinical testing may prove to be the first vaccine to be licensed that was discovered using reverse vaccinology methods (see section on antigen discovery). In addition to the combined A-C-Y-W conjugated polysaccharide vaccines that is available in many wealthier countries, a monovalent men A conjugate vaccine, has recently been developed specifically for sub-Saharan Africa where outbreaks of group A meningoccus epidemics are common. Through a novel public-private effort, development of this vaccine successfully targeted the regional need for an effective Men A vaccine and to provide the vaccine at a low price. 88 On the heels of this success, a novel mengingococcal serogroup X, once a very rare species, is now emerging as a new strain with prevalence similar to that of serogroup A ((WHO Intercountry Support Team http://www.who.int). To address this challenge, a second, independent vaccine development effort has been initiated.",

Development of these vaccines was enabled by clinical and animal model studies showing that antibodies directed against a specific viral target antigen (e.g., the HBV surface antigen or the HPV L1 protein) were implicated in protection. In addition, molecular biologic approaches enabled the derivation of fully recombinant vaccine antigens (such as those developed using a limited set of defined antigens of Bordetella pertussis), including genetically modified versions of bacterial toxins that maintain their proper antigenic structures but are no longer toxic. However, for many of the pathogens for which vaccines do not currently exist, application of these recombinant DNA technology-enabled strategies are insufficient due to incomplete understanding of the pathogen antigens that would elicit a protective host immune response.

To document the ability of an antigen to elicit protective immune responses, it is necessary to immunize an experimental animal (most commonly, mice) and then, following experimental pathogen challenge, evaluate infection outcomes in immunized versus nonimmunized animals. As this approach has most often been used to identify antigens recognized by host humoral responses, sera from animals immunized with a candidate antigen can then be transferred to a na\u00efve host to provide evidence that the antibody response to the antigen represents the relevant agent of immune protection.",

Scanning the entire pathogen genome via computer programs, genes that exhibit specific characteristics can be identified (e.g., predicted expression on the cell surface by virtue of possession of a leader sequence for secretion or membrane anchor sequences). 112 In addition, the relative conservation of the gene within the pathogen population can be determined by assessment of gene sequences from multiple distinct isolates. Once potential vaccine antigens are identified, each candidate gene is expressed in an appropriate rDNA system, and the protein product is tested in an animal model. 113 The first bacterial genome sequenced in its entirety was that of Haemophilus influenzae, marking the beginning of a new approach to vaccine antigen discovery. 114 Since this initial bacterial genome sequence determination, genomic sequencing of pathogens has advanced exponentially. Over 300 bacterial genomes have now been sequenced, and hundreds more are currently in process. Genome-based antigen discovery is being applied to a wide range of bacteria, including streptococci, pneumococci, staphylococci and Chlamydia, as well as nonbacterial pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum. 115 This general technique is now called \"reverse vaccinology\" (Fig. 90.4 ).",

In proteomic analyses, a small culture of bacteria, preferably taken directly from an infected person, or otherwise grown in physiologically similar conditions, is subjected to physical or enzymatic treatment with specific proteases to generate peptide fragments that are then fractionated by micro-high-performance liquid chromatography and sequenced by molecular spectrometry. An overlapping set of peptides of approximately 8-10 amino acids is sufficient to identify an antigen and provides the means to find the gene. 118,119 A combination of proteomic and serologic methods to select potential novel vaccine immunogens, called serological proteome analysis, or SERPA, 120, 121 can be used to screen the pathogen proteome for expressed proteins that are recognized by antibodies present in sera obtained from individuals who have recovered from an infection with the pathogen. The processes of vaccine development have changed significantly in recent years-a process facilitated by improvements in understanding of human immune system function, as well as the advent of powerful new technologies for vaccine development. Vaccine development is therefore now commonly pursued in a hypothesis-driven manner.

As such, \"adjuvant\" is a catch-all term including a broad range of molecular entities that act via diverse-and, in a number of instances, yet to be elucidated-pathways. Until recently, most adjuvants were derived empirically and the mechanisms by which they augmented immune responses were unknown. As a result, there were few, if any, principles available to guide the improvement of known adjuvants or the development of new ones. However, recent advances in understanding of the mechanisms by which dendritic cells sense the presence of pathogens and their constituents, and translate this information to shape the quantity, quality, and durability of host cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses, have transformed adjuvant discovery and optimization. What was once a process of trial and error now represents an area of hypothesis-driven research and mechanism-based discovery. A particularly promising advance emerged from the discovery that pathogen sensing by the innate immune system is mediated by recognition of specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) and other hemato-lymphoid and some epithelial cells (Chapter 3). 122 The pathogen-derived PAMPS recognized by TLRs consist of structures that are found only in or on pathogens (including bacteria, viruses, and parasites) and are not part of normal vertebrate biology. Following binding of a specific PAMP to a specific PRR, a specific cellular activation and response cascade is triggered that can directly confront an intruding pathogen and/or lead to the activation of specific host adaptive immune response mechanisms. These breakthroughs in basic immunology have been readily translated into what can now be considered the science of adjuvant biology. 123, 124 Such progress has occurred at an especially opportune time as new vaccine development strategies have transitioned from traditional approaches using attenuated or killed pathogens to highly defined and purified recombinant proteins (so-called \"subunit\" vaccines) or nonreplicating vectored antigens. Although these newer approaches are promising from the perspective of vaccine safety and the opportunity they afford to design the structures of vaccine immunogens, recombinant or synthetic vaccines are often inherently less immunogenic than traditional vaccines based on attenuated live viruses or intact killed organisms. In the context of current vaccine development \u2022 90 PART TEN \u2022 Prevention and therapy of immunologic diseases and regulatory approval processes, an adjuvant is developed as part of a vaccine, not as an independent product. Consequently, there are currently no adjuvants licensed by regulatory authorities as stand-alone products.",

TLRs are expressed in a number of innate immune cells, including DCs, macrophages, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. Given the importance of DCs as critical antigen-presenting cells, most studies of the biology of TLR signaling have focused on these cells. Different TLRs are expressed on distinct subpopulations of DCs, and, depending on the TLR, in distinct cellular compartments. TLRs expressed on the surface of human myeloid DCs include TLR2 (which is heterodimerized with TLR 1 or 6), as well as TLRs 4, 5, 6, and 10 ( Fig. 90.5 ), while these same cells express TLRs 3 and 8 within endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and phagolysosomes. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) express TLR7 and 9 within ER/phagolysosomes. The TLRs expressed on the cell surface are primarily activated by PAMPs encountered in the extracellular environment, while TLRs expressed in the ER/phagolysosomes are activated by PAMPs (including viral pathogen-derived RNA or DNA) that tend to be routed through these endosomal compartments. Activation of TLRs on innate immune cells leads to their production of specific cytokines, as well as their expression of co-stimulatory molecules, leading to induction of adaptive immune responses. Given that different DCs express different TLRs, and that signaling via different TLRs results in the expression of a distinct pattern of cytokines, it is believed that activation of specific TLRs can variously favor the induction of Th1-or Th2-biased immune responses, or can differentially augment either direct or cross-presentation pathways for antigen presentation (Fig. 90.5 ). Although most data on induction of specific types of immune responses by engagement of specific TLRs have emerged from murine studies (and have not yet been validated in humans), the ability to tailor an adjuvant preparation to achieve a desired type of immune response with a specific vaccine immunogen is a promising notion. Naturally occurring ligands for TLRs include lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from bacterial cell walls (recognized by TLR4), triacyl lipopeptides (recognized by TLRs 1), diacyl lipopeptides (recognized by TLRs 1), peptidoglycan (recognized by TLR2), flagellin (the monomer that makes up flagella, recognized by TLR5), single-stranded RNA (recognized by TLR7), double-stranded RNA (recognized by TLR3), and unmethylated DNA containing the dinucleotide pair CpG 126 (recognized by TLR9). Based on these insights, a variety of approaches to develop adjuvants predicated to activation of specific TLR pathways are being actively pursued.",

Individual genes are analyzed for the presence of putative structures that should be present on the surface of the bacterium (membrane anchors, certain types of secretion signals, etc) that could be vaccine targets (upper two drawings). In many cases, these initial candidate genes will be re-scanned against the genomes of alternate isolates of the same species in order to identify conserved surface antigens. Candidate genes that satisfy these criteria are then expressed as recombinant proteins that are then used to vaccinate animals. Antigens that raise the desired immune response are taken forward for further development. In parallel, a proteomic exercise may be carried out to confirm the presence of a selection of antigens on the surface of the bacterium, preferably taken from a patient sample with minimal in vitro culturing (lower two drawings). The bacterium is treated with a protease mixture that cleaves off surface proteins. The cleavage products are collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The cleavage products are broken down to small peptides as part of the spectrometry process, and their sequences are imputed from their molecular weights compared against the predicted sequences from the genome. This extra proteomics step can reduce the number of candidates to be screened in more expensive animal studies.",

These processes include the fact that replication of all viruses depends on gaining access to host cells for genome replication and for the synthesis of essential components of virus particles that permit further propagation of the infection within and between hosts. One immunologic benefit of this requirement is that de novo synthesis of viral gene products within infected cells provides a key opportunity for viral antigen presentation (via MHC class I pathways) and elicitation of antiviral cellular immune responses. Along with the processing and presentation of intact virus proteins via MHC class II pathways leading to production of antiviral antibody responses, live attenuated viral vaccines have a strong track record for induction of broad cellular and humoral immune responses. However, despite their track record of success, it is likely that few, if any, new live attenuated viral vaccines will be derived in a manner that resembles previous successful efforts (e.g., the empiric derivation of live attenuated polio, yellow fever, or varicella-zoster vaccines). Important reasons for this change include the desire for safe and well-characterized vaccines whose mechanisms of attenuation are defined and that can be monitored in the course of vaccine production and use. Indeed, most of the recently developed live attenuated vaccines were derived using new approaches for genetic reassortment (Fig. 90.2) . 142 Although such approaches have proven successful, they are limited in that they can only be applied to homologous viruses (e.g., those derived from the same virus type) whose genomes are segmented and capable of ready genetic reassortment in culture, or to viruses that can be manipulated by reverse genetics.",

Much of the poxvirus genome encodes gene products that serve to evade host immune responses, and that are not required for virus replication in tissue culture. Further, facile techniques for the insertion and deletion of specific viral genes have been developed. The ability to accommodate sizeable foreign gene inserts is, in part, a function of the large size of the poxvirus genome (and the large packaging capacity of poxvirus virions). As a result of these favorable attributes, poxviruses have been utilized extensively in laboratory studies of virus biology, recombinant protein production, and host immune responses. 148 Although poxviruses encode multiple gene products that help the virus evade host immune responses, they are, nevertheless, potent immunogens. Studies of individuals immunized decades ago with vaccinia virus (in the course of smallpox eradication efforts) have shown that this virus induces long-lasting memory T-and B-cell immune responses.",

One important limitation of all poxvirus vectors developed to date is that, given the large size of the poxvirus genomes and the multitude of gene products they naturally express, even large inserts derived from foreign pathogens of interest will present only a minority of the vaccine vector antigens delivered to and recognized by the host immune system. To be effective, approaches to focus immune responses on the antigen of interest will need to be developed. Toward this end, a variety of so-called \"prime-boost\" 149 approaches are being explored where the host immune response is primed with one type of recombinant vaccine vector (such as a DNA vaccine or adenovirus vector) and then boosted with subsequent delivery of poxvirus vectors encoding the same antigen. In this manner, immune responses to antigens of interest have been significantly augmented in a number of preclinical studies.",

More recently, it has garnered renewed interest as a potential safer smallpox vaccine in the wake of concerns about bioterrorism threats. Even though MVA cannot replicate in mammalian cells, the virus demonstrates favorable immunogenic properties. MVA has been used as a vector expressing genes for a wide variety of genes, including HIV, TB and malaria antigens either alone or in \"primeboost\" regimens, where MVA has been administered following initial priming immunizations with other vaccine vectors (or in the case of TB vaccines with BCG. 150 A concerted effort is under way to improve further the performance of MVA by manipulating a series of poxvirus genes that dampen the human immune response to the virus (and to any antigens inserted in it). 151 Avipox is a family of poxviruses that infect birds and cause respiratory diseases in poultry. Canarypox, a member of the avipox group, has been adapted as a vaccine vector. Canarypox replicates well on avian cells in culture but cannot replicate on human cells in culture or in humans in vivo. As a result, canarypox, like MVA, provides an interesting vector system with inherent safety features. 152 Canarypox vectors (most commonly ALVAC) have been tested in several clinical studies, either alone, or in \"prime-boost\" regimens following priming with adenovirus vectors and recombinant protein antigens. Indeed, an ALVAC vector encoding HIV antigens provided the priming immunizations (that were boosted with recombinant HIV gp120 Env antigen) in the previously described RV144 phase III HIV vaccine trial in Thailand. 61, 153 To date, the results from other human clinical trials of canarypox vectors have been disappointing, with only low-level specific immune responses generated in human volunteers. 154 Adenoviruses Adenoviruses, one of the common causes of upper respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, have seen extensive use in clinical trials and were one of the first gene therapy vectors. 155 Most adenovirus vectors currently being studied in preclinical and clinical settings are disabled by deletion of the early E1 genes that are necessary for replication in an immunized host. Most adenovirus vaccine vectors developed have used the wellcharacterized and readily produced adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) as the vector \"backbone.\" Disabled adenovirus vectors are grown in cells that express the E1 genes artificially inserted into the cell's genome. 156 Once these disabled vectors, encoding a heterologous pathogen-derived antigen of interest, enter a \u2022 90 Vaccines cell, the pathogen gene product is expressed, processed, and presented by host APCs. As adenoviruses can directly infect dendritic cells, they promise to provide efficient vaccine vectors. Robust antibody and CD8 T-cell responses to heterologous antigen genes expressed by adenovirus vectors have been observed in preclinical animal models. Furthermore, in earlyphase human clinical trials, adenovirus vectors have been generally well tolerated, and proven to be the most effective of any recombinant vector system studied to date in eliciting high-level CD8 T-cell responses.",

These viruses do not normally circulate in humans, so immunity to these viruses is quite rare in humans. Alphaviruses have a strategy for overexpressing the proteins that make up the virion by making a separate subgenomic RNA specifically encoding these gene products. Current recombinant alphavirus vaccine vector strategies take advantage of this subgenomic transcript, replacing the viral genes with selected genes for other antigens, but maintaining the signals for translation and protein production. In addition, through use of genetic complementation, it is possible to generate virus particles that only contain this heterologous antigenencoding expression cassette. Such virus particles can efficiently mediate infection of host cells, but because they lack other alphavirus genes needed for virus replication cannot spread beyond the initial target cell infected. 159, 160 Alphavirus vectors rival the adenoviruses in efficiency of protein production in tissue culture and have induced robust antibody and T-cell responses in preclinical studies. 161 One current limitation of the alphavirus vector system is the difficulty of scaling the production system; however, this is a technical matter that should be addressable. In addition, ample safety data will be needed before widespread use of alphavirus vaccines achieves endorsement by regulatory authorities for use in healthy populations.",

AAV is transmitted in conjunction with adenovirus infection, and is not known to cause any significant disease.

Although encouraging results have been reported in preclinical studies, phase I studies in humans have demonstrated disappointing immunogenicity. While the poor immune response to the virus may make AAV a less attractive vaccine vector, it has made it a good candidate for gene therapy wherein prolonged production of a gene might accrue without the immune system killing the infected cell. Indeed, positive results were recently reported demonstrating a clinical benefit in individuals with hemophilia B who received an AAV vector encoding human factor IX. 163 Recently, efforts have been made to adapt replication-defective AAV encoding a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against HIV as a novel strategy (termed vectored immunoprophylaxis) has demonstrated a promising ability to protect humanized mice against experimental challenge with HIV. 164 Should this approach prove similarly effective in human studies in the future, it will provide an interesting bridge between the previously distinct historical concepts of active and passive immunization approaches.",

            "text": "New vaccine strategies: reverse genetic approaches. The term \"reverse genetics\" refers to the use of recombinant DNA methods to generate infectious viruses possessing genomes derived from cloned cDNAs. Such cDNAs can be modified to study the impact of specific genetic modifications to viral phenotype, providing a new approach for the generation of live attenuated vaccines via either introduction of targeted mutations or, in the case of segmented viruses, the preparation of vaccines via genetic reassortment (seeFig. 90.4). Reverse genetic methods provide promising tools for the study and defined manipulation of both nonsegmented and segmented negative-strand RNA viruses (such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses, respectively). The use of reverse genetic strategies to generate infectious viral progeny from cloned cDNAs is shown above. Influenza virus genomes are comprised of eight single-stranded (negative-sense) RNA segments. Initiation of influenza virus RNA (vRNA) transcription from negative-sense genomic RNAs, and the replication of the virus genome, depends on the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex (which includes viral RNA, the nucleoprotein (NP) and three polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PA)). To generate infectious influenza virus from cDNAs of the vRNA genome segments, cells are cotransfected with all eight segments of vRNA under the control of RNA polymerase promoters. Cellular polymerase I (pol 1) synthesizes vRNAs that are then replicated and transcribed by the viral polymerase and NP proteins that comprise the RNP complex. Reverse genetics strategies are expected to facilitate the generation of novel flu vaccines by enabling preparation of well-defined vaccine preparations comprised of donor \"backbone\" viral segments (seeFig. 90.4) that harbor specific attenuating mutations with vRNA segments encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins obtained via reverse transcription of vRNA genes from circulating viruses (including those prepared from pandemic strains that may be difficult and/or unsafe to propagate in large manufacturing scale).(Adapted from Marsh GA, Tannock GA.

The targeted activation of specific dendritic cell (DC) populations via engagement of specific TLRs to initiate innate and adaptive immune responses represents a very promising approach for the development of novel adjuvants based on natural or synthetic versions of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that trigger specific TLRs. Specific TLRs and their natural activating ligands are shown above. Different TLRs are associated with different adaptor proteins that propagate intracellular signaling along distinct pathways which favor specific immune responses (e.g., Th1, Th2, crosspresentation or CTL priming). The character of responses from specific TLR engagement illustrated is based on animal and ex vivo studies. In humans, TLRs 7 and 9 are expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/phagolysosomes of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) that represent the major sources of type I interferon production (e.g., IFN-a). Human myeloid DCs (mDCs) express TLR3 (in the ER/phagolysosomes); and TLR2 (heterodimerized with TLRs 1 or 6), and TLRs 4, 5, 8, and 11 on the cell surface.(Adapted from Pulendran B, Ahmed R.
