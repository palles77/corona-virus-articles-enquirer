In virology, WGS is important for the development of novel treatments and vaccines, and for increasing the power of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genomics. In this Opinion article, we suggest that WGS of viruses in a clinical setting will become increasingly important for patient care. We give an overview of different WGS methods that are used in virology and summarize their advantages and disadvantages. Although there are only partially addressed technical, financial and ethical issues in regard to the clinical application of viral WGS, this technique provides important insights into virus transmission, evolution and pathogenesis.

            "text": "For small viruses, such as HIV, influenza virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), the sequencing of partial genomes has been widely used for research, but it also has important clinical applications. One of the main applications and reasons for sequencing viruses is the detection of drug resistance. For example, the management of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV relies on viral sequencing for the detection of drug-resistant variants. HAART has substantially improved the survival of patients who have HIV, but successful therapy requires long-term suppression of viral replication with antiretroviral drugs, which may be prevented by impaired host immunity, suboptimal drug penetration in certain tissue compartments and incomplete adherence to therapy 19 . When viral replication continues despite treatment, the high mutation rate of HIV enables resistant variants to develop. It has become standard practice in many parts of the world to sequence the HIV pol gene, which encodes the main viral enzymes, to detect variants that confer resistance to inhibitors of reverse transcriptase, integrase or protease 20 , particularly when patients are first diagnosed and when viral loads indicate treatment failure. Sequencing resistant variants has enabled targeted changes in treatment, which has resulted in greater reductions in viral loads than with standard care (undetectable HIV load in 32% versus 14% of patients after six months) 21, 22 . Thus, sequencing resistant variants to guide HIV treatment improves disease outcomes. Similar approaches have been used to identify resistant variants of HCV 23 , HBV 24 and influenza virus 25 . partial genomes has been used to detect drug resistance in RNA viruses, such as influenza virus 11 , and DNA viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 12 . Viral genome sequencing is becoming ever more important, especially in clinical research and epidemiology. WGS of pathogens has the advantage of detecting all known drug-resistant variants in a single test, whereas deep sequencing (that is, sequencing at high coverage) can identify low levels of drug-resistant variants to enable intervention before resistance becomes clinically apparent 13, 14 . Whole genomes also provide good data with which to identify linked infections for public health and infection control purposes 15, 16 . However, progress in using viral WGS for clinical practice has been slow. By contrast, WGS of bacteria is now well accepted, particularly for tracking outbreaks and for the management of nosocomial transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria 17, 18 .",

            "text": "In this Opinion article, we will address the challenges and opportunities for making WGS, using modern next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, standard practice in clinical virology. We will discuss the strengths, weaknesses and technical challenges of different viral WGS methods Why sequence whole genomes? Limited sequencing of the small number of genes that encode targets of antiviral agents, such as HIV pol, has been the norm in clinical practice. For the detection of a limited number of antiviral-resistant variants, WGS has been too costly and labour-intensive to use compared with sequencing only the specific genes that are targeted by the drugs. However, the increasing number of resistance genes that are located across viral genomes, together with decreasing costs of sequencing and the use of sequence data for transmission studies, are driving a reappraisal of the need for WGS. For example, antiviral treatment for HCV now targets four gene products (NS3, NS4A, NS5A and NS5B), and these PCR reactions (which increases the chance of failure), requires more starting material, is more labour intensive and generally less tractable for diagnostic use 31 . Sequencing the whole genome simultaneously captures all resistant variants and removes the need to design and optimize PCR assays for the detection of resistance to new drugs. A good example of this is HCMV, for which WGS can simultaneously capture the genes that encode targets of licensed therapies, such as UL27 (unknown function), UL54 (DNA polymerase) and UL97 (serine/ threonine protein kinase), and of newer drugs, such as letermovir, which targets UL56 (terminase complex). This enables comprehensive antiviral-resistance testing in a single test 12 . In addition, WGS can provide information on antigenic epitopes, virus evolution in a patient over time 12 , and evidence of recombination between HCMV strains 32 . WGS can also detect putative novel drug-resistant variants and predict changes to epitopes, although phenotypic testing of variants is required to confirm clinical resistance 33 and to map epitope changes 34 .",

BOX 1 explores the diagnostic applications for metagenomics and RNA-seq; for example, in encephalitis of unknown aetiology [62] [63] [64] , for which conventional methods such as PCR are often not diagnostic, metagenomics and RNA-seq have detected viral infections 65-67 and other DNA (cDNA)-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), abbreviated to VIDISCA), filtration, ultracentrifugation and the depletion of free nucleic acids, which mostly come from the host, have all been tried [74] [75] [76] [77] ; however, these methods may also decrease the total amount of viral nucleic acids so that it is insufficient for preparing a sequencing library. Non-specific amplification methods, such as multiple displacement amplification (MDA), which make use of random primers and \u03a629 polymerases, can increase the DNA yield. However, these approaches are time consuming, costly, and may increase the risk of biases, errors and contamination, without necessarily improving sensitivity 78, 79 .

WGS is also central for understanding the pathogenesis of Zika virus; for example, by trying to identify sequence changes that are associated with microcephaly, as it is currently unclear which genome regions determine pathogenesis. It is likely that numerous whole-genome sequences of Zika virus from around the world and from individuals with microcephaly and asymptomatic infection are required to link particular mutations to birth defects. So far, no changes in the Zika virus genome have been unambiguously associated with microcephaly 41, 72, 81 .

This was feasible because these viruses all have relatively small genomes that require only a few PCR amplicons to assemble whole-genome sequences. However, the PCR products, respectively 86, 87 . For clinical applications this is problematic because of the high laboratory workload that is associated with numerous discrete PCR reactions, the necessity for individually normalizing concentrations of different PCR amplicons before pooling, the increasing probability of reaction failure due to primer mismatch (particularly for highly variable viruses), and the high costs of labour and consumables 94 . Therefore, although PCR-based sequencing of viruses as large as 250 kb is technically possible, the proportional relationship between genome size and technical complexity make PCR-based sequencing of viral genomes that are more than 20-50 kb impractical with current technologies, particularly for large multi-sample studies or routine diagnostics. Another consideration is that increasing numbers of PCR reactions require a corresponding increase in sample amount, and this is not always possible as clinical specimens are limited. Improvements in microfluidic technologies may help to overcome some of these barriers; for example, Fluidigm, RainDance and other 'droplet' sequencing technologies. Microfluidics-based PCR and the pooling of multiple amplicons have been used successfully to sequence several antimicrobial-resistance loci (for example, from the microbiome of pigs) 95 and can also be used for viral genomes, potentially down to the single-genome level 96 .",

Results from this study, in which three different enrichment protocols, two metagenomic methods and one overlapping PCR method were evaluated, showed that metagenomic methods were the least sensitive, yielded the lowest genome coverage for comparable sequencing effort and were more prone to result in incomplete genome assemblies. The PCR method required repeated amplification and was the most likely to miss mixed infections, but when reactions were successful it resulted in the most consistent read depth, whereas read depth was proportional to virus copy number in metagenomics and target enrichment. PCR generated more incomplete sequences for some HCV genotypes (particularly genotype 2) than metagenomics and target enrichment. Target enrichment was the most consistent method to result in full genomes and identical consensus sequences. The ease of library preparation for metagenomic and target enrichment sequencing of HCV was considered a major advantage for clinical applications, but PCR may still be appropriate for samples that have very low viral loads. of the diversity in and between samples. Target enrichment is possible despite small mismatches between template and probe; however, whereas PCR amplification requires only knowledge of flanking regions of a target region, target enrichment requires knowledge of the internal sequence to design probes. However, if one probe fails, internal and overlapping regions may still be captured by other probes 69, 100 . Target enrichment is not suitable for the characterization of novel viruses that have low homology to known viruses for which metagenomics, and, in some cases, PCR using degenerate primers, which are a mix of similar but variable primers, may be more appropriate.",

With target enrichment sequencing, the whole viral genome could be sequenced in all 164 samples, whereas PCR-based capsid sequencing was only possible in 158 out of the 164 samples, owing to low virus titres and PCR primer mismatches, which suggests that target enrichment is more sensitive than PCR for sequencing norovirus and better accommodates between-strain sequence heterogeneity 92 . Target enrichment has also been used for samples that have low viral loads and incomplete genome coverage in metagenomic sequencing 107 . Both metagenomic and target enrichment sequencing can be used for pathogen genomes of all sizes, whereas PCR-based methods are less suitable for large viral genomes or for non-viral (that is, bacterial, fungal and parasite) genomes.",

These incidental findings remain a topic of intense medical ethical debate 108 . The risk of incidental findings in pathogen sequencing (for example, the discovery of HIV infection during metagenomic sequencing for other pathogens) is not novel and the solution The issues of sensitivity and contamination are especially important in WGS, because of the risk of both false-negative and false-positive detection of pathogens. Highly sensitive sequencing (whether metagenomic, PCR-based or target enrichment-based) may detect low-level contaminating viral nucleic acids 112, 113 . For example, murine leukaemia virus 114, 115 and parvovirus-like sequences 116, 117 are just two of many contaminants that can come from common laboratory reagents, such as nucleic acid extraction columns 118 . As with other highly sensitive technologies, robust laboratory practices and protocols are required to minimize contamination. It is also important to remember that the detection of viral nucleic acid does not necessarily identify the cause of illness, and it is good practice when using NGS methods for the diagnosis of viral infections to confirm the findings with alternative independent methods that do not rely on testing for nucleic acids. For example, in cases of encephalitis of unknown origin, positive NGS findings can be confirmed through immunohistochemical analysis of the affected tissue 65, 119 , or identification of the virus by electron microscopy or tissue culture 82 .",

Metagenomic sequencing is most appropriate for diagnostic sequencing of unknown or poorly characterized viruses, PCR amplicon sequencing works well for short viral genomes and low diversity in primer binding sites, and target enrichment works for all pathogen sizes but is particularly advantageous for large viruses and for viruses that have diverse but wellcharacterized genomes. Two obvious areas of innovation currently exist: methods that can effectively deplete host DNA without affecting viral DNA, and the further development of long-read technologies to achieve the flexibility and competitive pricing of short-read technologies. New technologies are required to unite the strengths of these different methods and enable healthcare providers to invest in a single technology that is suitable for all viral WGS applications. single reads.

Achieving the high coverage that is necessary to ensure accurate variant typing is challenging when there is a lot of host DNA compared with viral sequences, and when the error profile of a technology makes point mutations particularly hard to detect 125 . At the time of writing, MinION sequencing (R9 pore chemistry) has raw high quality (so called '2D reads') read error rates of around 5% (J.

Depleting the nucleic acids of the host is an alternative solution, as a higher proportion of virus reads would be recovered from each sequencing run. Although there are already solutions in place to achieve this for bacterial sequencing (for example, depletion of human ribosomal RNA or mitochondria,",
