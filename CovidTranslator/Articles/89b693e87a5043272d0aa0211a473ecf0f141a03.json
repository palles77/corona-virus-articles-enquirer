            "text": "Background: The rate of admissions to hospital with bronchiolitis has increased over the past years. The reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial including improved survival of preterm infants. Aim: To assess the severity of viral bronchiolitis in preterm compared to term infants admitted at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt, based on the outcome. Patients and methods: This prospective study was conducted throughout a 3-year period from September 2011 to October 2014. It included 153 infants, 74 healthy preterm, and 79 healthy term infants admitted with clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) was recorded, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from each patient at the time of presentation. Viruses were identified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The clinical course and patient's outcome were recorded. Results: This study recorded a significantly more severe BSS for preterm compared to term infants. The preterm group had an increased mean length of hospital stay and oxygen therapy and was more likely to need intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation (MV) compared to the term group. The mean (\u00b1 SD) BSS for infections with h-MPV, RSV, and para-influenza 3 was more significantly severe in preterm compared to term infants. Bacterial co-infection was significantly correlated with severity scoring in both groups. Conclusion: Prematurity significantly affects the severity of bronchiolitis, and this underscores the importance of early categorization as a high-risk group on their first visit. The physician should be aware that their illness runs a more severe course, even if they have no underlying disorders.",

RSV was the most frequently isolated respiratory virus in both preterm and term infants with bronchiolitis, and adenovirus was the second most frequently detected virus in the current study. The predominance of RSV is in concordance with the assertion that this virus is the single most frequently identified lower respiratory tract pathogen in hospitalized infants worldwide [17] [18] [19] [20] . Although, RSV significantly affects more term infant in this study, yet it is likely to be associated with more severe disease in preterm infants, this observation is important in planning protocols for bronchiolitis prophylaxis and management in such high-risk preterm infants. Similarly, h-MPV and para-influenza 3 infections were more severe in preterm than term infants. So, physicians treating preterm infants with RSV, h-MPV, and para-influenza 3 bronchiolitis should be aware that their illness is more protracted and runs a more severe course than term infants, even if otherwise healthy. The low prevalence of virus detection among preterm compared to term infants with acute bronchiolitis in this study could be attributed to other respiratory viruses which were not included in this study such as coronaviruses, bocaviruses, and rhinoviruses, and may be also explained by the fact that only patients admitted with severe infections were included in our study.",

This was similar to results reported by Ricart et al. [22] who found that severe bronchiolitis had more mean of hospital stay compared to non-severe and more prolonged duration of oxygen and MV. We documented that preterm infants have a more severe form of illness than term infants where we found that prematurity significantly affects the severity score of bronchiolitis. Increased illness severity in infants who had bronchiolitis was discussed in several researches [1, 23] . In this study, we found that preterm infants were significantly younger than those born term, similar to that reported by Fleming et al. [1] . Mixed viral infection and bacterial co-infection in the present study were more frequently observed in preterm compared to term infants with acute bronchiolitis. However, bacterial co-infection was significantly correlated with severity scoring, while mixed viral infection did not correlate with severity scoring of bronchiolitis, and this was in consistence with what was reported by others [22, 24, 25] . This indicates that infection with multiple viruses in infants is a common situation that does not change the clinical course of bronchiolitis. However, some studies have reported an increased risk for severe bronchiolitis in dual viral infection [26] [27] [28] or even in some specific viral infections such as RSV and h-MPV co-infection [29] [30] [31] .",
