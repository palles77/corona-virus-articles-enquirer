The distribution of N. caninum in tissues of adult cattle is unknown and the parasite has not been demonstrated histologically in tissues of cows. In the present study the distribution of N. caninum in different tissues of adult cattle was evaluated by bioassays in dogs. Seventeen dogs (2-3 month-old) were fed different tissues of 4 naturally exposed adult cattle (indirect fluorescent antibody test N. caninum titer \u2265400): 5 were fed with masseter; 5 with heart, 3 with liver, 4 with brain, and 3 pups were used as non-infected control. Two dogs fed masseter, 2 fed heart, 1 fed liver, and 3 fed brain shed oocysts, and all dogs presented no seroconvertion to N. caninum during the observation period of 4 weeks. The oocysts were confirmed as N. caninum based on the detection of N. caninum-specific DNA by PCR and sequencing. The results indicate that dogs can be infected by N. caninum with different tissues of infected cattle.",

The sequencing analysis of PCR-ITS-1 fragments derived from these oocysts revealed homogeneous chromatograms, i.e. the samples appear to not contain other Neospora-like oocysts than N. caninum. Analogous situation was observed with the 4 dogs that shed Neospora-like oocysts which were negative by PCR-Nc5. In this case, the sequencing anal-ysis of chromatograms derived from PCR-ITS-1 revealed sequences similar to H. heydorni and only homogeneous chromatograms were observed. The oocysts identified as H. heydorni were eliminated by 4 dogs, and all of them had ingested muscular tissues (masseter or heart), which confirms the importance of muscles in the H. heydorni infection for dogs (Schares et al., 2005) . Soares et al. (2009) also infected crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous) with H. heydorni after they were fed with masseter and brain tissue of naturally infected bovines.",
