According to the World Health Organization, in 2009, there were an estimated 9.4 million incident cases (range, 8.9 million-9.9 million) of TB globally, equivalent to 137 cases per 100,000 population. Most of the estimated number of cases occurred in Asia (55%) and Africa (30%), with smaller proportions of cases occurring in the Eastern Mediterranean region (7%), the European region (4%), and the region of the Americas (3%). India alone accounts for 21% of all TB cases worldwide, and China and India together account for 35%. 4 The HIV pandemic has contributed to these numbers because 1.0 to 1.2 million (11%-13%) cases of TB were reported in HIV-positive people. Because the rate of cure in new cases of smear-positive TB is lower among HIV-positive patients (<40%) than among HIV-negative patients (>60%), transmission is facilitated in places where HIV infection Tropical and Parasitic Infections is highly prevalent. 1, 4 Of these HIV-positive TB cases, approximately 80% were in the African region. 4 Other immunocompromised hosts, including solid organ transplant (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, are also more prone to reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (LTBI). 5 ",

The risk of TB in transplant recipients is estimated to be 20 to 50 times higher than in the general population, even in developed countries, 6, 7 and mortality rates vary from 20% to 40%. 8 Most reports of TB are in SOT recipients, especially after renal transplantation. The prevalence of LTBI among renal transplant recipients in North America is 0.5% to 1%, in Northern Europe is 1% to 4%, and in India and Pakistan can reach 15%. 9 In Brazil, TB is number one among the neglected tropical diseases after transplantation, with an incidence of around 1% in HSCT recipients and 2% in SOT recipients. 10, 11 Reactivation of LTBI accounts for most TB cases reported in transplant recipients and largely reflects the local incidence. 1 Graft transmission has been documented in renal, lung, and hepatic transplantation but accounts for less than 5% of all TB cases in transplant recipients. In one international study, 4% of TB infections in recipients were considered donor derived. 8 Recently, a case of donor-derived TB that resulted in the infection of 2 of the 3 transplant recipients (with 1 death) has raised the discussion regarding the need for donor TB screening with new blood tests (interferon gamma release assays [IGRAs]) to diagnose LTBI. 12",

The washing of organ blood during the transplantation procedure may not be enough to eliminate possibly parasitized red cells within the organ, and transmission may occur. In transfusion-associated malaria, symptoms generally develop earlier (1-3 days) than if the infection is transmitted through infected cells within the organ (>1 week). 18 Plasmodium species are capable of surviving for more than 24 hours in blood at 4 C. Therefore, the cold preservation time is generally not enough to prevent transmission, especially in heart and liver transplantations, which require shorter cold preservation time (3-4 hours for heart, <12 hours for liver) than kidney transplantation (24-48 hours) . The reports of malaria cases after multiorgan donation have supported the hypothesis of the graft as a source of Plasmodium in transplant recipients.

Chagas disease is endemic in the Americas, from the south of the United States to the south of Latin America. As a consequence of the initiatives of the South and Central American countries since 1991 in the control of Chagas transmission, the disease prevalence has been reduced from the 1990 estimates of 16 to 18 million people infected to 9 to 12 million people in 2004. 25 The parasite is generally transmitted through the feces of infected triatomine insects by penetration of the parasite into the bite wound, conjunctiva, or other mucous membranes. 26 Transmission can also occur by organ transplantation, blood transfusion, from mother to child during pregnancy, and laboratory incident. More recently, some outbreaks due to the ingestion of contaminated food or drink have been reported. [27] [28] [29] Transmission through blood products Blood transmission is considered as the second most important method of acquiring Chagas disease. With the exception of blood derivatives, all blood components are infective. Transmission by blood transfusion was first suggested by Mazza in Argentina in 1936, and the first cases of transfusion-associated Chagas disease were published in 1952. 30 The true number of reported cases is also underestimated because no more than 350 cases have been published. 31 In nonendemic countries, cases of transfusion-associated transmission can go undetected because acute infections are often asymptomatic and the level of awareness of Chagas disease among clinicians is low. 28 In endemic countries where mandatory screening tests have been implemented since 1991, the residual risk of infection is calculated to be around 1:200,000 units. 32 ",

Because a single organ donor may infect several recipients, all guidelines strongly recommend using organs exclusively from negative donors.

After the introduction of NAT, the risk of TT of HBV, HCV, and HIV in the United States was 1:600, 1:1149, and 1:1467, respectively. 48 Nevertheless, the additional yield obtained by NAT over a fourth EIA is minimal and becomes significant only in regions where HIV prevalence and incidence are high, such as in South Africa. 49 However, the risk of transmission through organ transplantation must be balanced against the risk of recipients dying while waiting for an organ. Due to organ shortage and because organ transplantation is often lifesaving, organs from donors with elevated risk of HIV infection may be accepted (with informed consent from the recipient) whenever the benefit of transplantation is considered to outweigh the risk of potential disease transmission. 50 Recipients of organs from increased-risk donors are recommended to undergo testing 1, 3, and 12 months after transplantation. 51",

Due to organ scarcity, it is acceptable to transplant organs when both the donor and the recipient are reactive for anti-HBc, and, in some centers, HbsAg-positive organs are transplanted into recipients with anti-HBsAg titers that are considered to be protective, that is, more than 100 IU/L. However, this situation is associated with a worse prognosis and frequent reactivation of HBV, leading to graft loss. In endemic countries, such as Italy, Greece, China, and Taiwan, blood donors are screened by the HBsAg test because the prevalence of a high anti-HBc titer would considerably affect the pool of available donors. Other countries such as the United States, Germany, and Brazil use both HBV markers for screening. More recently, NAT was extended to HBV-DNA and incorporated in a multiplex format to HCV and HIV NAT platforms. NAT not only identifies donors on the HBV window period but also interdicts donations regarded as having occult B infection (OBI), thus deeming individuals negative for HBsAg but harboring HBV-DNA as potentially infectious. OBI is common in areas where HBV is endemic and is responsible for the few transfusional cases verified before the introduction of NAT. The current risk of TT HBV in the United States, where 3 parallel tests are performed (NAT, anti-HBc, and HBsAg), is estimated as greater than 1:500,000. Whenever possible, NAT of organ donors should be accomplished because this group usually presents a higher risk for infectious markers. 54 Hepatitis C Epidemiology HCV is an RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It is transmitted by contact with blood, and, in contrast to other members of the Flaviviridae family, HCV transmission to humans by arthropod vectors was never reported. HCV was first cloned from the plasma of individuals experiencing posttransfusion hepatitis not associated with hepatits A viruses (HAVs) or HBVs. After HCV was cloned and characterized in 1989, a laboratorial tool for identification of infected patients was rapidly developed and used in epidemiologic studies and for screening blood and organ donors. 55 It is estimated that approximately 2% of the world population are carriers of HCV. 56 A population-based survey has shown that the true prevalence is 1.42% in the United States. Egypt has the highest prevalence (15%-20%), and this has been attributed to massive spread of this virus during campaigns for the treatment of schistosomiasis along the Nile River from 1961 to 1986. 57 Transmission through blood products HCV was identified in the search for a cause of hepatitis that is frequently observed in transfusion recipients in whom HBV and HAV infections were ruled out by laboratory tests. Before anti-HCV tests were made available in 1990, the so-called non-A non-B hepatitis had an incidence greater than 10% in patients with multiple transfusions. Nowadays, the risk is about 1 in 1,000,000 transfused units when NAT and antibody testing are performed. 58 ",

In the SOT cases, the donors had a recent history of bat and dog bites, which were not elicited or considered important. Because bat teeth are very fine, bat bites and bat-inflicted scratch marks may be undetectable and the epidemiologic risk underestimated. In the United States and Canada, the incidence of bat-variant rabies cases increased from 2.2 cases per billion person-years from 1950 to 1989 to 6.7 cases per billion person-years from 1990 to 2007. 65 ",
