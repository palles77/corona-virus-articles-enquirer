These include nine aquareoviruses, eight picornaviruses, six iridoviruses, five herpesviruses, three rhabdoviruses, three retroviruses, a paramyxovirus, and a coronavirus. Not all of these agents have been isolated in cell culture or established as etiologic agents of disease by controlled transmission studies. The burgeoning number of fish viruses is a reflection of the increased interest in fish diseases, particularly those occurring in aquaculture facilities, and the number will surely grow as fish farming intensifies on a global scale. This review chronicles the new virus isolates and lists them with other members of their virus family where appropriate.",

However, during the five years since its publication, more than 35 new viruses have been isolated or identified from finfish. Some of these agents are known to be new agents, while others may simply be isolates of known agents from new hosts. This increase in the number of known fish viruses is a direct reflection of the increased surveillance of fish populations that has accompanied the worldwide expansion of aquaculture. These newly described agents are broadly distributed among the known virus families and include members of the Herpesviridae, Picornaviridae, Reoviridae, Retroviridae, Coronaviridae, Iridoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae. Although the focus of this review is on those viruses described during the past 5 years, we have also listed in tabular form the previously described members of the rhabdovirus, herpesvirus, iridovirus, and aquareovirus groups in the hope that such listings will be useful to the reader.",

            "text": "Another reovirus-like agent was isolated from landlocked salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) in Taiwan by Hsu et al. (12) . The isolate not only showed the typical syncytial type of cytopathic effect (CPE) in CHSE cells but it also replicated well in bluegill fry (BF-2), brown bullhead (BB), channel catfish ovary (CCO), and Atlantic salmon (AS) cells, the optimal growth temperature being 20 \"C. Varner and Lewis (13) isolated a reovirus from marine angelfish (Pomecanthus semicirculatis) exhibiting head and lateral line erosion (HLLE) syndrome. Superficial erosions of the head and face progress down the lateral flank to the lateral line. Healthy angelfish exposed to the isolate died after developing similar lesions. Jiang and coworkers (14) in the People's Republic of China reported the isolation of a reovirus from the internal organs of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) with epidermal hyperplasia. The virus grows in cell lines of both common carp and grass carp origin and produces the characteristic syncytia that are the hallmark of these agents. Attempts to experimentally infect common, grass, silver, or bighead carp were all unsuccessful. Most recently, Chew-Lim et al. (15) isolated a virus from the spleens of sick grouper (Plectropomus maculatus) being cultured in Singapore. The virus was isolated in a cell line derived from Asian seabass fry but it also grew in BF-2 cells. A limited characterization of the agent indicated properties similar to those of the aquareoviruses, particularly the above mentioned carp virus (14) . During the past several years, we, along with colleagues in collaborating laboratories, have made and characterized four additional reovirus isolates from several species of finfish. The SBR isolate was obtained from striped bass (Morone saxatifis) with numerous external hemorrhagic lesions (16) that were collected from the Chesapeake Bay. These fish were also concomitantly infected with a bacterium of the genus Moraxella. Another isolate was obtained by Moore and McMenemy (19) from sex products of different populations of normal Atlantic salmon being routinely sampled in New Brunswick, Canada. A third strain (SRV), characterized by Marshall et al. (18) , was isolated from rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) suffering mortalities in Canada; a picornavirus-like agent was also isolated (19). The fourth isolation was made in Spain from cultured turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) that also were infected with a bacterium, a member of the genus Vibrio (20). Both agents were recovered from the kidneys and livers of affected turbot in a population exhibiting chronic mortality. The typical syncytial-type CPE produced by these agents is shown in Fig. 1 . Molecular characterization. Samal et al., (21) compared the biochemical characteristics of the above four reoviruses. The genome of each isolate was composed of 11 segments of dsRNA and each isolate had a unique electropherotype in polyacrylamide gels. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed similar RNA profiles for all three North American isolates whereas the European isolate was quite different. Similarly, reciprocal RNA-RNA blot hybridizations, showed cross-reactions among the three North American strains but not between the North American strains and the European (turbot) isolate (22) . No genetic relationship was found between any of the four isolates and the mammalian group A rotavirus SA 11 (22). We have compared 19 of the aquareovirus isolates by dot-blot hybridization and have defined 5 genetic groups based on their cross-reactivity or lack thereof. Three of the groups are monotypic containing only one virus while the remaining 2 groups contain the other 16 isolates (Lupiani, Subramanian, Hetrick, and Samal, unpublished information) .",

Although each isolate had a unique polypeptide profile, their overall polypeptide patterns were similar (23). All of the other aquatic reoviruses that have been characterized have similar genome and protein profiles except for the grass carp virus which has 10 rather than 11 segments of dsRNA. These results are similar to those reported previously by Winton et al. (24) who characterized five of the first aquareoviruses isolated. Hsu et al. (12) compared the biochemical characteristics of the landlocked salmon virus (LSV) with four other aquatic reoviruses, chum salmon virus (CSV), catfish reovirus (CRV), golden shiner virus (GSV), and 13~2 virus isolated from the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica). A comparison of the electropherotypes of the RNA genomes and virion proteins showed LSV to be closer to CSV in RNA pattern but more like 13~2 in its protein profile. However each of the viruses had characteristic RNA and protein patterns and could be readily distinguished from each other. In an analogous comparison, Varner and Lewis (13) found that the electrophoretic profiles of genomic segments and polypeptides of the angelfish reovirus displayed similar, but distinct, migration patterns from those found with CSV, GSV, and CRV.",

The general findings, as detailed below, are similar to those reported for the previously studied aquareoviruses in that they exhibited little or no virulence. Intraperitoneal inoculation of rainbow trout with the coho salmon virus did not cause mortalities nor were any external lesions evident (11). The virus did replicate in the fish and focal necrotic lesions were noted in the livers of some animals. The turbot virus produced only low grade mortalities in fry but not in older turbot and had only low virulence for rainbow trout fry. This virus was isolated from turbot that were also infected with a Vibrio sp. The Vibrio was shown to be pathogenic for rainbow trout, but, treatment of the fish with oxolinic acid was not totally effective in arresting the mortalities which suggests the turbot reovirus may have some role in the pathologic condition (20). It is noteworthy that one year after the initial outbreak, both agents were isolated from surviving turbot that developed the same pathological condition. Like the turbot virus, the striped bass virus was isolated from fish suffering from a disease with a possible mixed etiology. Juvenile striped bass inoculated with the virus did not suffer mortalities but virus was recoverable from the visceral organs for up to 10 weeks postinoculation.",

A rhabdovirus was isolated from striped snakehead (Ophicephalus striatus) and freshwater eel (F&a alba) suffering from a severe ulcerative disease in southeast Asia (38). The virus was isolated from different areas of Thailand and Burma and has been named ulcerative disease rhabdovirus (UDRV) because it was thought to be the cause of the ulcerative condition plaguing fish in several Southeast Asian countries. The virus appears to be distinct from previously described rhabdoviruses both in its cell culture spectrum and the fact that it is neutralized only by homologous antiserum and not by antisera to other rhabdoviruses (38). Its role as a pathogen for snakehead fish however, has not been demonstrated, but it is a vesiculovirus type that is serologically distinct from a second lyssavirus type, the snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV), isolated by Wattanavijarn et al.

No cytopathic effects were seen in the CHSE-214, RTG, or EPC cell lines and this refractory nature differentiates UDRV from other rhabdoviruses including viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), infectious hematopoietic necrosis (IHN), eel virus American (EVA), European eel virus (EVEX), spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), pike fry rhabdovirus (PFRV), hirame rhabdovirus (HRV), perch rhabdovirus (PRV), and SHRV which all replicate in one or more of these cell lines. Viral infectivity for the susceptible lines varied from titers of 102.' to 106.9 TCIDso per ml depending on the cell line employed, but generally the titers were lower than those normally obtained with fish rhabdoviruses. The cytopathology is characterized by the appearance of granular and rounded cells which eventually lyse. In some cultures, initial CPE resulted in only partial destruction of the monolayer after which normal cells grew in and reestablished confluency. Generally, such healed monolayers become carrier cultures of the virus (38). The virus replicated optimally at 24-30 \"C in snakehead fin and carp cell lines. Growth curves in epithelioma populosum cyprini (EPC) cells with SHRV showed a latent period of 4 h with all cell-associated virus being released by 14 h.",

Waterborne exposure and i.p. injection of the virus into Atlantic salmon did not cause mortalities nor was virus recovered postinfection. Hedrick et al. (46) reported isolation of a small RNA virus from numerous salmonid broodstocks in California. Isolations were made from ovarian fluids of adult cutthroat trout (0. clarki), rainbow trout (0. mykiss), brown trout and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and from kidney and spleen tissues of juvenile brown and brook trout. However, the virus was not associated with above normal losses in these species. The most sensitive cell line was CHSE-214 and the virus had an optimal growth temperature of 15 \"C and a range of 4-20 \"C. Transmission studies did not produce mortalities but virus was recovered for periods up to 3-5 weeks following waterborne exposure of rainbow and brown trout but not chinook or coho salmon (46). Eaton and coworkers (47) reported the isolation of a picornavirus-like agent from the ovarian fluid of steelhead in Washington State, USA. The virus grew in a variety of cell lines and produced a unique type of cytopathology characterized by multinucleated cells which later formed aggregations of cells containing numerous gas-filled vacuoles. The virions were 25-30 nm icosahedrons with a single stranded RNA genome. No deaths occurred among rainbow trout inoculated with the virus although virus was detected in trout tissues for at least four weeks postinjection. This virus may be the same as the one isolated from Atlantic salmon from the same geographic region (45). The size differences reported (25-30 for the steelhead virus and 39.5 nm for the Atlantic salmon virus) may be due to the fact that the steelhead virus dimensions were determined in thin sections of tissues while the Atlantic salmon virus preparation was partially purified and negatively stained.",

Walleye develop a dermal sarcoma that can involve 27% of adults in the spring although the tumors regress in the summer (56,57). The tumor appears histologically malignant but it neither invades nor metastasizes (58). The tumor is readily transmitted by inoculation of cell-free filtrates into susceptible fish (59) and water temperature affects both the incidence and time required for tumor development (60). Preliminary hybridization studies indicated that a linear unintegrated species was the major form of viral DNA in the tumors (61). Martineau et al.

The biological properties of this second herpesvirus suggest that it differs substantially from WSHV-1 and should be considered a separate and unique agent. The WSHV-2 appears to be both more pathogenic (inducing higher mortality in experimental studies) and can be found both in skin and internal organs of infected white sturgeon. In addition, the virus is more rapidly lytic in cell culture and shows a broader host cell range, replicating in several cell lines from white sturgeon other than the WSSK-1 line.

Typical herpesvirions were observed in affected Malpighian cells with a capsid diameter of loo-140 nm surrounded by an envelope of 190-230 nm (94). The virus could not be isolated in five commonly used fish cell lines but 0.45 pm filtrates made from infected fish readily infected previously healthy flounder following immersion exposures (95). Up to 50% of the virus-exposed fish died during the 14 day experiment and all survivors showed some form of epidermal hyperplasia. Additional filtration studies showed that the virus could pass filters as small as 0.22 pm but not 0.1 pm. In similar filtration studies, Miyazaki et al. (95) found that experimentally exposed flounder experienced a 96% mortality over 9 days with the first deaths beginning 2 days after immersion exposure at 20 \"C. Naturally and experimentally infected fish show a cloudy to white external appearance due to the enlarged and hyperplastic epidermal cells. These cells undergo necrosis and may be seen as loosely attached aggregates on the surface of the fish.

Only in the past six years have iridovirus-like agents been recognized as causes of serious systemic diseases among feral, cultured, and ornamental fish populations (102) (103) (104) 107, 109) . Few properties of these systemic agents have been described, but their morphological and biological characteristics clearly separate them from the piscine iridoviruses or iridovirus-like agents associated with lymphocystis, erythrocytic necrosis, cod ulcus syndrome, eel and cyprinid infections, or the recently described epidermal infections in sturgeon (107, 115) .",

As described here during the past 5 years another 35 new agents have been described in the literature including 9 aquareoviruses, 8 picornaviruses, 6 iridoviruses, 5 herpesviruses, 3 rhabdoviruses, 2 retroviruses, 1 paramyxovirus, and 1 coronavirus. Undoubtedly some of these isolates are similar, if not identical, to previously reported viruses. In this regard, we enter a plea to investigators describing new virus isolates that they carefully compare, or have compared, the relatedness of their isolates with similar agents already known before adding another virus name to the literature. Similarly, we ask that those reviewing manuscripts describing new viral agents require that the authors demonstrate through direct compari-sons the unique nature of an agent before approving the publication. In this manner, all of us can contribute to an orderly and systematic grouping of the many viruses found in fish.",
