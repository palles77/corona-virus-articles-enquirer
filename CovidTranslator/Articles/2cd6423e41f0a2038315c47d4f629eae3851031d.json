This chapter highlights some of the more common and well-known diseases with significant peripheral blood film abnormalities. Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) is a group of genetic immunodeficiencies affecting both cellular and humoral immunity. Almost all patients with SCID have a marked decrease in circulating T cells, poorly functioning B cells, hypogammaglobulinemia, and profound clinical manifestations.

Shortly after birth, patients suffer from recurrent infections, often affecting skin and mucosal infections. Lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and neutrophilia are common findings. The clinical severity, including number of infections and survival, depends on the amount of b 2 integrins produced. 20 Infant mortality rate is high in LAD I. LAD II presents in a similar manner as LAD 1, however leukocytes have normal b 2 integrins. There are molecular defects in SLC35C1, which codes for a fucose transporter that moves fucose from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi region. Fucose is needed for posttranslational fucosylation of glycoconjugates, which are required for synthesis of selectin ligands. 21 In LAD II, selectin synthesis is compromised. Clinically, LAD II patients have recurring infections, neutrophilia, growth retardation, a coarse face, and other physical deformities. In LAD II the defective fucose transporter leads to an inability to produce functional selectins and defective leukocyte recruitment, which leads to recurring infections. Other clinical findings related to defective fucose transport are absence of blood group H antigen, growth retardation, and neurologic defects. 22 LAD III is caused by mutations in Kindlin-3. 23 Kindlin-3 protein along with talin are required for activation of b integrin and leukocyte rolling. In LAD III, leukocytes and platelets have normal expression of integrins; however, there is failure in response to external signals that normally results in leukocyte activation.

Approximately 60% of cases are X-linked recessive and 40% are autosomal recessive. 26 X-linked recessive patients experience a more severe disease course and have shorter lifespans than autosomal recessive patients. CGD is caused by mutations in genes responsible for proteins that make up the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Under normal conditions, phagocytosis of foreign organism leads to phosphorylation and binding of cytosolic p47 phos and p67 phos . 17 Primary granules containing antibacterial neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G and secondary granules containing the cytochrome complex gp91 phox and gp22 phox migrate to the phagolysosome. NADPH oxidase forms when p47 phos and p67 phos along with p40 phox and RAC2 combine with the cytochrome complex. Superoxide is generated in the phagolysosome when an electron from NADPH is added to oxygen. NADPH has additional regulatory functions in the generation of other antimicrobial agents. Most cases of CGD are due to mutations in gp91phox or p47. The genes implicated in CGD and protein products are listed in Table 26.2. CGD patients experience life-threatening catalase-positive bacterial and fungal infections. Advancements in care, including the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics and azole antifungals, have improved the clinical course of the disease and increased survival rates. 27, 28 CGD is diagnosed through a test that uses a fluorescent probe dihydrorhodamine to measure intracellular production of reactive oxygen species. 26 ",

Cell size is smaller, the nucleus/cytoplasm (N/C) ratio of PHA neutrophils is lower, and chromatin is darker, more coarse, and more densely clumped than band neutrophils, metamyelocytes, and myelocytes.

            "text": "Niemann-Pick disease (NP) is characterized by an accumulation of fat in cellular lysosomes of vital organs, which impairs their function, leading to a range of clinical findings. NP has three subtypes. Types A and B are caused by recessive mutations in the SMPD1 gene located within the chromosomal region 11p15.4. This results in a deficiency of lysosomal hydrolase enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) and a subsequent buildup of the substrate sphingomyelin in the liver, spleen, and lungs. 40 More than 180 mutations in SMPD1 have been reported. 40 Foam cells and sea-blue histiocytes can be seen in the bone marrow. Foam cells are macrophages with cytoplasm packed with lipid-filled lysosomes that appear as small vacuoles (foam) after staining (Figure 26.9 ). Sea blue histiocytes are macrophages with lipofuscin-, glycophospholipid-, and sphingomyelin contained in -cytoplasmic granules, 1 to 3 m in diameter, that appear blue with Wright stain. Type A (acute neuronopathic form) NP mostly affects Eastern European Jews. Type A presents in infancy and is associated with failure to thrive, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, vision problems, and rapid neurodegenerative decline that results in death, usually by 4 years of age. In type A, there is less than 5% of normal sphingomyelinase activity. In type B (the non-neuronopathic form) there is approximately 10% to 20% normal enzyme activity. 52 Type B NP is more common in individuals of Northern African descent and presents in the first decade to adulthood with a variable clinical course. Although there is no neurocognitive impairment, patients experience massive hepatosplenomegaly, heart disease, and pulmonary insufficiency. 53 Diagnosis of types A and B NP is based on enzymatic quantitation of sphingomyelinase activity in cell or tissue extracts. Genetic testing screens for three genes responsible for more than 90% of cases in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and one gene in approximately 90% of type B patients from North Africa. 40, 53 Treatment primarily consists of enzyme replacement therapy, although it is ineffective at slowing the progression of neurologic disease in type A patients. Type C NP is an autosomal recessive lipidosis in which mutations in NPC1 or NP2 gene (95% and 5% of cases, respectively) causes impaired cellular trafficking and homeostasis of cholesterol. 54 The result is buildup of unesterified cholesterol in lysosomes. The clinical presentation in type C NP is heterogeneous with regard to age of onset and type and severity of neurologic and psychiatric symptoms, as well as visceral involvement. 40, 54 Early diagnosis is important because substrate reduction therapy can slow the progression of neurologic damage 55 ; however, because of its heterogeneous presentation, diagnosis is often challenging. A suspicion index tool for type C disease has been found to be highly sensitive and specific for arriving at a presumptive diagnosis. 56 Confirmation is obtained through genetic testing or biochemical staining of cultured fibroblasts with filipin to demonstrate unesterified cholesterol in cellular vesicles. Therapy focuses on symptom relief. The prognosis in type C NP is poor, with most patients dying before the age of 25 years. 57",

Agranulocytosis refers to a neutrophil count of less than 0.1 3 10 9 /L. Some causes of neutropenia are (1) increased rate of removal or destruction of peripheral blood neutrophils ; (2) fewer neutrophils released from the bone marrow to the blood because of decreased production or ineffective hematopoiesis, where neutrophils are present in the bone marrow but not released into circulation because they are defective; (3) decreased ratio of circulating versus marginal pool of neutrophils; or (4) a combination of these.",

Neutropenia has been associated with almost all classes of drugs and is a result of myeloid suppression or immunologic response. Many agents used to treat cancer are known to induce neutropenia, including traditional myelosuppressive chemotherapeutics, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies. Nonchemotherapy druginduced neutropenia and agranulocytosis most often present as idiosyncratic reactions. The annual rate of occurrence of drug-induced agranulocytosis is 2.3 to 15.4 cases per million in the United States. 58 The mortality rate is 10% to 16%. 58 Immune neutropenia. In neonatal alloimmune neutropenia (NAN), maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) crosses the placenta and binds to paternal human neutrophil antigens (HNA) found on fetal leukocytes. Antibody-coated neutrophils are removed from circulation by the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in an ANC of less than 0.5 3 10 9 /L. Of the nine HNA located on Fcg-receptor IIIb (FcgRIIIb), HNA-1a, -1b, -1c, -1d, and -2 are most often implicated in NAN. 59, 60 The incidence of NAN is not well defined; it varies from .02% to 0.8% of live births.

Additionally, neutrophils may exhibit changes in morphology such as toxic granulation, D\u00f6hle bodies, and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Toxic granulation appears as dark, blue-black granules in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, usually in segmented and band forms. Toxic granules are peroxidase positive and reflect an increase in acid mucosubstance within primary, azurophilic granules that may enhance bactericidal activity. 79 There is a positive correlation between level of C-reactive protein (an acute phase protein) and the number of neutrophils with toxic granulation; therefore toxic granulation is suggestive of inflammation. 7, 80 In addition, toxic granulation can be seen in various infections as well as in patients who have received G-CSF. 81 Toxic granulation can mimic granulation found in Alder-Reilly anomaly.

D\u00f6hle bodies are relatively nonspecific. Their presence has been associated with a wide range of conditions, including bacterial infections, sepsis, and pregnancy. 82, 83 D\u00f6hle bodies are similar in appearance to the inclusions found in May-Hegglin anomaly.

B and T lymphocyte activation results in the transformation of small, resting lymphocytes into proliferating larger cells. These reactive lymphocytes spill into peripheral circulation. Reactive lymphocytes often present as a heterogeneous population of various shapes and sizes. There is variation in the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, nuclear shape, and chromatin pattern, which is clumped, but some cells may contain less condensed chromatin. Nucleoli may be visible. An increase in basophilic cytoplasm that varies in intensity within and between cells is a common finding. The cytoplasm may be indented by surrounding RBCs; however, other cells, including blasts, may also show similar indentation. A plasmacytoid lymphocyte is a type of reactive lymphocyte that has some morphologic features of plasma cells (Figure 26.20) .

Clinical findings include recurring severe infections, organomegaly, and neurologic defects. \u2022 Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, digestive issues, infections, physical anomalies, neurologic defects, bone marrow failure, and increased risk of leukemia. \u2022 Chronic granulomatous disease results from a failure in the neutrophil respiratory burst after ingestion of organisms. Patients suffer from severe recurrent infections; however, advances in the use of antimicrobial agents have been effective at improving the clinical condition. \u2022 WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis syndrome) is a disorder of white blood cell (WBC) movement from the bone marrow to blood resulting Answers can be found in the Appendix. 1. Which of the following inherited leukocyte disorders is caused by a mutation in the lamin B receptor? a. Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly b. Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi disease c. Alder-Reilly anomaly d. May-Hegglin anomaly 2. Which of the following inherited leukocyte disorders involves mutations in nonmuscle myosin heavy-chain IIA? a. Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly b. Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi disease c. Alder-Reilly anomaly d. May-Hegglin anomaly in leukopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, bacterial infections, human papillomavirus infection, and warts. \u2022 Pelger-Hu\u00ebt anomaly is a genetic disorder resulting in hypolobulated mature leukocytes. These cells can be confused with immature neutrophils. An acquired form of hyposegmentation called pseudo-Pelger-Hu\u00ebt is associated with hematologic neoplasms and other disorders. \u2022 Alder-Reilly anomaly is a manifestation of mucopolysaccharidosis characterized by metachromatic granules in leukocytes, which can be confused with toxic granulation. \u2022 May-Hegglin anomaly is characterized by thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and D\u00f6hle body-like inclusions in leukocytes.",

Partially digested GAGs build up and disrupt cellular functions leading to serious physical and neurologic problems. \u2022 Gaucher disease is characterized by a deficiency in b-glucocerebrosidase and accumulation of cell sphingolipids leading to a range of clinical manifestations and increased risk for malignant transformation \u2022 Niemann-Pick disease is caused by a deficiency in sphingomyelinase and buildup of fats in various organs in the body, resulting in neurologic defects, organomegaly, failure to thrive, and early death. \u2022 Reactive changes in neutrophils include a left shift, D\u00f6hle bodies, toxic granulation, and vacuoles. \u2022 Reactive morphology in monocytes includes segmenting nuclei, changes in granule color and size, and irregular cytoplasmic borders. \u2022 Reactive changes in lymphocytes include increased size, increased basophilic cytoplasm, and morphologic heterogeneity.
