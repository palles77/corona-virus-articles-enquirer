EVD is frightening, but in the United States its risk is statistically almost negligible; if risk perception reflected quantifiable likelihood, patients, politicians, and pundits here would be focusing on influenza and other familiar hazards instead. Yet Ebola has become the movie star of pathogens, outshining Lassa, Marburg, and its other relatives, publicized and mythologized out of all proportion to its knowable characteristics.",

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has appropriately taken the lead (and, in some situations, taken the flak). Spreading practical knowledge faster than the virus itself can move is essential to prevent EVD from gaining a foothold outside the initial affected area-and, with luck, bringing its effect within that area under control as well.",

The Ebola virus has a basic reproduction number (R 0 ) ranging from 1.51 in Guinea and 1.59 in Liberia to 2.53 in Sierra Leone, 5 far less infectious than rubeola, pertussis, smallpox, or rubella and somewhat less so than influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or HIV.

The belief that any emergency department (ED) would recognize Ebola and send a patient for proper care turned out to be erroneous, in part because \"in the previous administration, there was a lot of emphasis on hospital preparedness for bioterror events,\" Dr. Morse noted, citing exercises for smallpox attacks. \"Most of them are not prepared for Ebola, and we might have thought otherwise, first of all because of all these hospital preparedness exercises over the last 10 years or so, and secondly because of all the attention that Ebola had gotten and all the messages being directed to health care workers and physicians and providers from CDC. I would have thought that with all that saturation, people would have a high level of suspicion or high level of awareness of the possibility of Ebola, especially in people coming from affected countries, or",

P reparedness in any ED begins, but does not end, with the essential steps outlined in the CDC's \"Identify, Isolate, Inform\" guidelines and algorithm for triage, evaluation, isolation, reporting, and PPE use. 7 Mark Jarrett, MD, MBA, professor of medicine at Hofstra North Shore-Long Island Jewish School of Medicine and another participant in the New York Society for Health Planning/ American Institute of Architects event, emphasized planning and thorough, repetitive training for all staff because errors proliferate when unfamiliar situations force staff to get up to speed quickly. Even when the CDC's protocols are summarized visually in flow sheets, he said, \"what we've learned is, they look very simple; when the staff has a patient, they get very nervous, and this becomes very complicated.. It's all about the staff: if you're going to take care of a patient, the staff has to be protected, so you really need to have easy directions on what to do.\" (Dr. Morse added that \"normally you would put your most experienced people onto working with Ebola patients, given the bad history we've seen to date.\") PPE procedures 8 require practical training in advance; for personnel becoming newly accustomed to the steps involved in donning, wearing, and doffing these hot, awkward garments, performing routine clinical tasks such as taking vital signs while wearing them is no trivial matter. \"M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res,\" noted Dr. Morse, \"has been setting the standard for this. They have had the fewest casualties, if you will, and I think the best safety record. And a lot of the current guidelines really are very much like what MSF is doing.\" Donning and doffing PPE, he says, is \"a complex operation, especially the doffing part, because nobody enjoys it very much. It's counterintuitive, and the haven't seen any of the data, and even if I did, I don't know that you can sort it out.\" Noting that experiments with convalescent serum transfer have not been successful in nonhuman primates, he is not sanguine about that approach.",

Like not touching people who are sick from Ebola. Or not touching people who have died from Ebola.. The cost is very cheap, which doesn't mean they're easy. But that really should be where 99% of our focus should be.\" Some of the impediments to relief and outreach efforts by the International Rescue Committee and other organizations involve shortsighted decisions made in the developed world, as well as the obviously difficult field conditions. When science writer Laurie Garrett, author of The Coming Plague (1995) and Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow, went to Liberia to cover local conditions, she discovered that American International Group and other insurers were invoking force majeure clauses to get out of their contractual provisions to provide medical evacuation if needed.
