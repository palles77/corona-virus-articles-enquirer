A series of tripeptide a,b-unsaturated esters and ketomethylene isosteres, including AG7088, are synthesized and assayed to target the 3CL protease. Though AG7088 is inactive (IC 50 > 100 lM), the ketomethylene isosteres and tripeptide a,b-unsaturated esters containing both P1 and P2 phenylalanine residues show modest inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 11-39 lM). The Phe-Phe dipeptide inhibitors 18a-e are designed on the basis of computer modeling of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The most potent inhibitor 18c with an inhibition constant of 0.52 lM is obtained by condensation of the Phe-Phe dipeptide a,bunsaturated ester with 4-(dimethylamino)cinnamic acid. The cell-based assays also indicate that 18c is a nontoxic anti-SARS agent with an EC 50 value of 0.18 lM.",

The SARS-CoV is a positive-strand RNA virus that encodes two replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1b. 4 Extensive proteolytic processing of these nonstructural polyproteins is required to provide the functional proteins for viral propagation. These processes are mediated primarily by the main protease (M pro ), which is also known as dimeric chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ). 5 The active site of SARS-CoV 3CL protease contains Cys145 and His41 to constitute a catalytic dyad, in which cysteine functions as the common nucleophile in the proteolytic process. 5 The 3CL protease cleaves pp1a at no less than 11 conserved sites with a sequence of (Leu, Met, Phe)-Gln # (Ser, Ala, Gly), in which a P1 glutamine residue invariably occupies the S1 site. 5, 6 The 3CL protease is essential for the propagation of the virus, and thus serves as a key target for the discovery of anti-SARS drugs.",

These protease inhibitors include C 2 symmetric peptidomimetic compounds, 7 zinc-conjugated compounds, 8 bifunctional aryl boronic acids, 9 a quinolinecarboxylate derivative, 10 a thiophenecarboxylate, 11 and phthalhydrazide-substituted keto-glutamine analogs. 12 AG7088, a ketomethyl isostere of a tripeptide-conjugated ester (compound 1a in Scheme 1), is a potent inhibitor against human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C protease, 13 which is also a cysteine protease that mediates the maturation cleavages of replicase polyproteins. 14 The structure of AG7088 incorporates a c-lactam moiety to mimic the amido side chain of the P1 glutamine residue. To improve the cell membrane permeability, the P2 phenylalanine residue is replaced by a methylene isostere bearing a 4-fluorophenyl substituent. The previous pharmacophore models, 5,15 by analogy to the structure of TGEV main proteinase, indicated that AG7088 can partially fit into the putative binding pocket of the SARS-CoV 3CL protease, and the moiety of conjugated ester in AG7088 may function as an acceptor of Cys145. Thus, AG7088 is proposed to be a model for the design of inhibitors against the SARS-CoV 3CL protease. 2 In this paper, we describe the synthesis, the inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CL protease and anti-SARS activity of AG7088, the related ketomethylene isosteres and the peptidomimetic a,b-unsaturated esters. Although AG7088 turns out to be inactive, the a,b-unsaturated ester 18c is found to be a potent antiviral agent with K i of 0.52 lM and EC 50 of 0.18 lM.",

The ester group in 6 was effectively reduced by NaBH 4 in the presence of LiCl.

The S N 2 reaction between triflate 10 and the valine-derived malonate 11 was followed by removal of the tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group under acidic conditions to provide the desired ketomethylene isostere 12. Catalytic hydrogenation of 12 in the presence of di-tert-butyl carbonate furnished a direct conversion of the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group to the Boc group in 13. Some ketomethylene isosteres are known to be susceptible to epimerization in alkaline conditions. 13a In our case, hydrolysis of 13 was realized by using 1.1 equiv of LiOH (0\u00b0C, 1 h), without complication of epimerization, and the acid product was then treated with allyl iodide in the presence of Cs 2 CO 3 to give the allyl ester 14 as a single product. An oxidative condensation of 2,5-hexadione with aqueous HNO 3 gave 5-methyl-3-isoxazolecarboxylic acid, 18 and the corresponding acyl chloride 15 reacted with 14, after removal of the Boc group, to give amide 16 in the presence of N-methylmorpholine. The allyl group in 16 was smoothly removed by the catalysis of Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 , and the resulting acid was coupled with the amine derived from 7 to culminate in the synthesis of AG7088. The spectroscopic properties of our prepared sample are in agreement with those reported for AG7088. 13 For the investigation of the structure-activity relationship, we also applied a combinatorial approach to synthesize other ketomethylene isosteres (e.g., 1b-d) having various R and R 0 substituents at the P2 and N-terminal sites. In addition, the corresponding tripeptidomimetic a,b-unsaturated esters 2a-d were prepared by the procedures generally used in peptide synthesis. By using phenylalanine to replace the P1 residue of lactam-glutamate, a series of ketomethylene isosteres 3a-d and tripeptidomimetic a,b-unsaturated esters 4a-d were also synthesized for comparison study.",

The anti-SARS compounds 18a-e were further evaluated at multiple concentrations to deduce the concentrations for 50% inhibition of the host growth (CC 50 ) 24 and the 50% inhibitory concentrations of virus replication (EC 50 ) by the enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 7 None of 18a-e are toxic to the growth of host cells at 200 lM, the highest concentration used in this assay. The EC 50 values of compounds 18c, 18d, and 18e deduced by ELISA measurements of the viral spike protein expressions are 0.11-0.18 lM (Table 2) . Thus, the ratio of CC 50 to EC 50 , the selectivity index (SI), for compounds 18c-e is very high (>1000). The antiviral activity of 18c was confirmed by Western blotting assay using antispike protein monoclonal antibody (Fig. 5) . A significant suppression of viral expression of 3CL protease was also observed on treatment with 18c at a concentration of 1 lM (data not shown). Although the real reasons for smaller EC 50 than K i are unclear, we speculate that the environment and the physical state of the 3CL protease may be very different between the SARS-infected cells and the recombinant 3CL protease used in the cell-free assays. We tried assay conditions using a low concentration (5 nM) of the SARS 3CL protease in an extended reaction time (1 h) and showed no sign of slow inhibition due to the irreversible bond formation with compounds 18c-e. The assay with a prolonged period is infeasible due to depletion of the substrate. It is uncertain whether the actual inhibitor binding may be tighter through a slow conformational change. On the other hand, the inhibitor may partially block the process for polyprotein maturation. 21 Previous studies suggested that dimeric 3CL protease is the active form. 5 Studies using cell-free systems also suggested that the N-and C-terminal tagged forms can be autoproteolyzed, and the autoproteolytic process is susceptible to protease inhibitors. 21 Furthermore, 3CL protease can also proteolyze polyproteins in trans for their maturation. 21 The cell-free studies therefore suggested the presence of multiple forms of proteolytic activities, and the physical states of the 3CL protease and their reactivity in SARS-infected cells are likely to be even more complicated. Like 3CL protease, the HIV protease is synthesized as part of the polyprotein that is autoproteolyzed for the protease maturation. It is thought that the dimerization of the HIV protease takes place while the enzyme is still in the form of a polyprotein that is synthesized and migrated to the membrane budding sites. Both the location and the timing of the autoproteolysis are crucial for the HIV viral infectivity. 25, 26 Very little is known on the physical state and the enzyme reactivity of the 3CL protease in SARS-infected cells. It is thus impossible to surmise, at this time, the rate-limiting target of the protease inhibitors on SARS infectivity. More studies are needed to understand the regulation, proteolytic activity, and physical states of the enzyme present in the SARS-infected cells for the control of SARS virus using protease inhibitors.",

The most potent inhibitor 18c, with an inhibition constant of 0.52 lM, is obtained by condensation of the Phe-Phe dipeptide a,b-unsaturated ester with 4-(dimethylamino)cinnamic acid. The cell-based assays indicate that 18c is a nontoxic anti-SARS agent with an EC 50 value of 0.18 lM. In addition to valinomycin with an EC 50 of 0.85 lM, 7 to our knowledge compounds 18c-e represent the most potent anti-SARS agents known to date. Our computational study of structure-activity relationships shows that hydrogen bonding with the main chain Glu166 and the side chain Gln189 are crucial to the inhibitory potency. This interaction is supported by a modeling complex of SARS-CoV 3CL protease with the inhibitor 18c. We are currently investigating the cocrystal structure, which can give an insight into the proposed complexation mode for further design of new anti-SARS compounds.",

The structures of inhibitory compounds were built in CAChe (Fujitsu, Japan) and refined by performing an optimized geometry calculation in Mechanics using augmented MM2 parameters and stored in PDB format. MGLTOOLS (MGL, Scripps Institute) was used for structure preparation and parameter creation to meet the input requirements of Autodock. Briefly, essential hydrogen atoms were added to the structure model of 3CL pro followed by assigning Kollman united atom charges and solvation parameters. Compound molecules were assigned Gasteiger-Marsili charges, 28 merge nonpolar H atoms, and defined torsions. Autogrid tool in Autodock 3.0.5 was applied to compute energy grids (60 \u00b7 60 \u00b7 70 in xyz directions with 0.375 \u00c5 spacing) of various types of compound atoms.
