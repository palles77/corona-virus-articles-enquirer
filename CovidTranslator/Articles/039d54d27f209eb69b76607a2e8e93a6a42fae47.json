We describe how a group of mostly family physicians and administrators of the JPS Health Network (JPS) took primary responsibility for 3,700 evacuees of Hurricane Katrina who came to Tarrant County, Texas. JPS provided medical care to 1,664 (45%) evacuees during a 2-week period. The most common needs were medications for chronic illnesses and treatment of skin infections (primarily on the feet). The JPS Emergency Department saw only 148 evacuees, most of whom arrived by their own transportation and were not seriously ill. JPS created a triage center located several miles from the hospital that referred almost all evacuees with health care needs to a primary care clinic. It was an effective approach for caring for the medical needs of disaster victims and prevented an emergency department and hospital from being overwhelmed. The JPS experience may guide future planning efforts for natural or manmade disasters, especially pandemic threats.",

This approach might be particularly useful in a future pandemic event, either from a naturally occurring threat such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or 23 that the JPS experience might help fi ll. Previous SARS threats found that the number of concerned and exposed persons who sought treatment vastly outnumbered individuals who were infected with SARS (Table  1) . Overcrowded emergency departments typically do not have the capacity to care for a surge of thousands. As for manmade threats, Wein et al determined that the primary bottleneck in treating the victims of an anthrax attack is caused by limited hospital capacity, and they estimated that the death rate from such an attack could be cut in half if this bottleneck were avoided. 11 The JPS approach would eliminate that bottleneck.",
