There exists an increasing demand to manufacture various AAV serotypes in large quantities for pre-clinical and clinical trials. A generic and scalable method has been described in this study to efficiently produce AAV serotypes (AAV1-9) by transfection of a fully characterized cGMP HEK293SF cell line grown in suspension and serum-free medium. First, the production parameters were evaluated using AAV2 as a model serotype. Second, all nine AAV serotypes were produced successfully with yields of 10 13 Vg/L cell culture. Subsequently, AAV2 and AAV6 serotypes were produced in 3-L controlled bioreactors where productions yielded up to 10 13 Vg/L similar to the yields obtained in shake-flasks. For example, for AAV2 10 13 Vg/L cell culture (6.8 \u00d7 10 11 IVP/L) were measured between 48 and 64 h post transfection (hpt). During this period, the average cell specific AAV2 yields of 6800 Vg per cell and 460 IVP per cell were obtained with a Vg to IVP ratio of less than 20. Successful operations in bioreactors demonstrated the potential for scale-up and industrialization of this generic process for manufacturing AAV serotypes efficiently.",

However, the most commonly studied are the eleven AAV serotypes (AAV1 to AAV11) isolated from human, simian, and rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys. Serotype AAV6 (Rutledge et al., 1998; Xiao et al., 1999) is believed to be a recombinant product of AAV2 and AAV1. AAV serotype 2 has been extensively studied for delivering genes to treat a variety of diseases. They are unable to replicate in the absence of helper viruses and to date, no known human pathogenicity have been associated with wild-type AAV infections. Also persistent long-term transgene expression levels are achieved (Xiao et al., 1996) when transducing dividing and non-dividing cells. It has been reported that humoral responses of infection by AAV2 is common and neutralizing AAV2 antibodies are present in the range of 35-80% of the human population throughout the world depending on the age group and the country, suggesting the limitation on the potential of AAV2 as delivery system Erles et al., 1999; Moskalenko et al., 2000) . Boutin et al. (2010) investigated humoral responses to natural exposure of AAV types 1, 2, 5, 6, 8 and 9 and reported that all four IgG subclasses were produced. They concluded that vectors based on AAV5, AAV8 and AAV9 are the best candidates for gene therapy in humans. Many researchers considered the use of different serotypes of AAV to circumvent the pre-existing immune response. More importantly, it has been observed that serotypes of AAV transduce cells from different organs with various efficiencies. Therefore, a specific AAV serotype could be selected for efficient gene delivery into target tissues. Van Vliet et al. (2008) have summarized the tissue specific transduction efficiencies. Asokan et al. (2012) reviewed advances in the use of AAV for gene therapy application. They summarized the best combinations of AAV serotypes with organs, e.g., liver (AAV8), cardiac and musculoskeletal (AAV1, AAV6 and AAV9), central nervous system (e.g., for Parkinson, Alzheimer's Batten's epilepsy, lysosome storage disorder: AAV5 and AAV9), and eye (AAV8). The serotypes AAV1 to 8 were investigated to transduce rat myocardium (Palomeque et al., 2007) out of which AAV1 and AAV6 were identified as the best candidates; the efficacy of AAV1, 2 and 5 was compared for the delivery of gene to different regions of the nervous system (Burger et al., 2004) ; for gene delivery to heart when compared to AAV1, 6, 7, and 8, AAV9 was the most efficient (Bish et al., 2008) ; and AAV6 was shown to be more efficient in delivering gene to cornea in vitro when compared to AAV8 and AAV9 (Sharma et al., 2010) . AAV serotypes 1, 5, 7 and 8 among the serotypes 1-8 tested showed most effective cell mediated immunity response in muscle when compared to AAV2 (Xin et al., 2006) . Attempts have been made in constructing laboratoryderived serotypes to target single tissue type to minimize the AAV dosage required for a treatment. For example, Asokan et al. (2010) engineered AAV2i8 from AAV2 and AAV8 to change the properties of the new virus construct. This construct reduced the gene expression in mouse liver by 40 folds (in contrast to AAV8) while high levels of expressions were observed in the muscle cells (in contrast to AAV2). Relatively very low levels of expressions were observed in Brain. Lin et al. (2009) showed that recombining different capsids increased the responses to HIV-1 gag which is a further advancement to the use of AAV as vaccine. This showed that by mixing different serotypes, the properties of AAV could be engineered to maximize the expression in the target tissue. The delivery of AAV vaccine by selecting intranasal, subcutaneous or muscular route has different effect on immune response (Xin et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "There are different modes of AAV production. AAV has been produced successfully in producer cell lines and packaging cell lines (Chadeuf et al., 2000; Clark et al., 1995; Farson et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2000; Thorne et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2007) where the cells could be anchorage dependent or in suspension. Producer cell lines contain all AAV production components (e.g., vector genome and AAV Rep & Cap) and helper virus (e.g., Adenovirus type 5) is used to induce. Packaging cell lines use two viruses, one to induce the AAV rep-cap genes present in the packaging cell line and the other to supply the gene of interest to be encapsidated. Stable cell lines (Clark et al., 1995; Liu et al., 2000) are more practical for large-scale manufacturing with consistently high yields after the success of the proof of concept. Transient transfection technology, however, offers a rapid generation of material for the proof of concept. For transient transfection the components required for AAV production are supplied by plasmids, or in a combination of plasmids and a helper virus. Transient transfection has been done using adherent cells in cell plates (Salvetti et al., 1998; Zolotukhin et al., 1999) , cell factories (Drittanti et al., 2001) or roller bottles (Liu et al., 2003) . When the scaling up of the process is desired in a short period of time to generate pre-clinical/clinical material or material required for the proof of concept, methods using adherent cells may need more incubator space and are timeconsuming and labor-intensive processes. Technology is advancing to support the anchorage dependent cell growth as well by providing up to 100 layered CellCube \u00ae units (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA) with liquid volume of 6000 mL which can support more than 10 10 cells. Selecting cells that are able to grow in suspension is an alternative for scaling up in conventional bioreactors (Durocher et al., 2007; Park et al., 2006; Reed et al., 2006) . A major advantage of transient transfection is that serotype-specific vectors of AAV can be easily generated in a short period of time by supplying a capsid/replication plasmid of choice, along with the transgene and helper plasmids. Therefore, transfection is the most chosen mode for AAV production to rapidly generate preclinical material. Another approach using the insect cell-baculovirus system for AAV manufacturing has recently attracted attention and has shown great potential for the large-scale manufacturing of clinical material (Meghrous et al., 2005; Mena et al., 2010; Urabe et al., 2002) . The advantages and challenges of the different methods have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (Aucoin et al., 2008) .",

The system was used for the production of different serotypes of AAV. Among the plasmids supplied to produce different serotypes of AAV, the AdV helper and transgene plasmids remained the same in all productions. The plasmid containing the capsid proteins supplied for the production of AAV dictated the serotype produced. Assuming that the production of different serotypes may be less dependent on the type of capsid plasmid used, selecting one serotype as a model has minimized the number of experiments necessary to evaluate parameter optimization; therefore, generalizing the production protocol, which would be suitable to produce all serotypes available. From the available serotypes, AAV2 was selected as a model AAV for the investigation of production parameters. The effects of plasmid DNA concentration at different cell densities on the transfection efficiency for the production of AAV were investigated. Using optimal transfection conditions, nine serotypes of AAV (AAV1-9) were produced in shake flasks to demonstrate the production of multiple serotypes in the cGMP HEK293SF-3F6 cell line. Scalability was evaluated by producing two serotypes (AAV2 and AAV6) in three runs of 3-L bioreactor.",

(1997) was adapted for AAV infectivity assay where sample is diluted before addition to the cells to have the GFP positive cells in the range of 2-20% to assure that only single virus has entered the cell for GFP expression. The lysed samples either were assayed with or without the purification by iodixanol step gradient ultracentrifugation protocol. Infectivity assay is independent of the contaminant DNA, but reveals the percent recovery from the iodixanol purification step. The GFP-positive cells were quantified by FACS using HEK293 cells in suspension as described by Chahal et al. (2007) or HeLa cells as anchorage dependent cells but with the similar protocol. Briefly, the HeLa cells were co-infected with wild-type Adenovirus similar to HEK293 cells. After 24 h of infection, the cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized for 15 min at 37 \u2022 C. The cells were suspended in medium containing 10% serum to inactivate the trypsin and the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 2% formaldehyde solution in PBS. The GFP-positive cells were quantified by FACS. AAV genomic particles were determined by real-time-qPCR. Lysed samples treated with Benzonase \u00ae were purified by iodixanol step-gradient protocol. The purified samples were diluted 100fold and retreated with 50 units of Benzonase \u00ae /mL to ensure the removal of host-cell DNA and unpackaged virus DNA. The High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid kit (Roche Applied-Science, Indianapolis, USA), was used to purify viral nucleic acids from AAV samples before real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The samples were diluted in water and supplemented with Poly A and Proteinase K solutions. A standard curve was generated for each RT-PCR run. The reaction was performed in the LightCycler 3 instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada). The reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 L containing 18 L of PCR Mix, 12 L H 2 O, 1 L forward primer 5 mM, 1 L reverse primer 5 mM, 4 L Master Mix LightCycler Fast-Start SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada) and 2 L of template (serial dilution of standard from 10 3 to 10 8 molecules, unknowns or water for the negative control).

Fig. 8 showed that the genomic particles produced after 48 hpt were in the same order of magnitude (\u223c10 10 Vg/mL cell culture) for all AAV serotypes whereas 4-28% were present in supernatant. Table 2 shows percent AAV in the supernatants of different AAV serotypes production cultures at 48 hpt. Most of the AAV serotypes produced are cell associated. At 48 hpt, AAV6, AAV7 and AAV8 showed higher proportion of Vg in supernatant (28, 29 and 19%, respectively) . AAV serotypes produced different levels of infectious viral particles. It should be noted that AAV infectivity assay is done using either HEK293 (or HeLa cells in Fig. 7) and because AAV serotypes are tissue specific Fig. 7 . AAV serotypes (AAV1-9) were produced using HEK293SF cells at cell density of 1.00E+06 cells/mL in 20 mL of serum-free medium in 150-mL shake flasks in duplicates. The cell cultures were harvested 48 h post transfection (hpt). Infective viral particles were assayed using HEK293 and HeLa cells. Fig. 8 . AAV serotypes (AAV1-9) were produced using HEK293SF cells at cell density of 1.00E+06 cells/mL in 20 mL of serum-free medium in 150-mL shake flasks in duplicates. The cell cultures were harvested 48 h post transfection (hpt). The whole cell cultures and supernatant of cell cultures (by removing cell pellet by centrifugation) were purified by iodixanol protocol, and then assayed for genomic (by PCR) and infective viral particle (using HEK293 cells) concentrations. therefore, infective assay does not reflect similar information for comparative purpose, but should be used only as an indicator that the vectors are functionally active to infect cells and are capable of expressing the gene. a The genomic particles obtained by real-time qPCR were back calculated for concentration in cell culture by diving by 2.46 factor (12.3 loaded on tube and 5 mL withdrawn). Percent genomic particles present in the supernatant were calculated by dividing the Vg in supernatant/mL cell culture by Vg in whole cell culture/mL (shown in Fig. 8 ) multiplied by 100%. Fig. 9 . Bioreactor was inoculated at a cell density of 0.35E+06 cells/mL with 97% viability. The cells were transfected with the PEI/DNA complexes (polyplexes) with PEI to DNA ratio of 2:1 in a serum-free medium to produce AAV2. The total cell culture volume at the start of transfection was 2000 mL. Samples were taken every 8 or 12 h intervals up to 96 hpt.

The cell cultures with higher DNA concentrations showed significantly larger number of aggregates. This result was probably due to excess plasmid DNA or a high concentration of PEI associated with DNA in polyplexes formed with a higher DNA load at the time of transfection. Polyplexes have a net positive charge. It is hypothesized that polyplexes, when present in excess, may act as bridges between the cells that are usually negatively charged and cause aggregation. Therefore, a PEI to DNA ratio of 2:1 was used in all the transfections done in this study based on earlier work in the author's laboratory. These observations and recommendations were dependent on the formulation of the serum-free medium selected. Because of the proprietary nature of the commercial serum-free medium used, it was difficult to speculate the effect of other macromolecules present in the cell culture medium. It was also difficult to assess the interactions with polyplexes and the mechanism of transfection. Park et al. (2006) showed that the quantity of DNA that was optimal for AAV production was dependent on the cell line, the mode of production (such as anchorage or suspension) and the type of the medium. Optimal DNA concentrations for suspension cells were 6-12 g/mL for HEK293 and HEK293T (adapted for suspension) with yields of 24,000 and 115,000 Vg/cell, respectively. For the anchorage dependent cells, the optimal DNA concentration was 3 g/mL for HEK293T with a yield of 65,000 Vg/cell (Park et al., 2006) . It should be noted that methods for determining genomic particles are not standardized and vary from one laboratory to another (Aucoin et al., 2008) . Among the different media tested, Hildinger et al. (2007) reported that optimal AAV yield was obtained with 1.25 g DNA/mL with a PEI:DNA ratio of 3:1 in a medium composed of 1:1 mixture of RPMI and Ex-Cell media. It was also reported that cutting down the DNA to half reduced the yield by about 50% but by increasing the DNA did not have proportional gain in the yield.",

Volumetric production did not increase proportionally at cell densities higher than 1.0 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL (Fig. 3) , which was also reflected by the cellspecific yield (Fig. 4) . Similar reduced transfection efficiency was observed by Hildinger et al. (2007) and they concluded that it could be because DNA-PEI polyplexes were added on a volumetric basis. The low yield in cell cultures at higher cell densities could be due to the exhaustion of some key components from the medium necessary for AAV production and cell maintenance. These observations also indicated that there is a potential for improvement in the AAV production yield by optimizing the medium and designing some feeding strategies for high cell density cultures in a fed-batch mode. This problem remains largely unsolved and requires a more detailed analyses and a better understanding of the cell metabolism and kinetic mechanisms involved in the transfection and expression processes. The \"cell density effect\" is a metabolic limitation that has been observed in the author's laboratory with other expression systems. Henry et al. (2004) addressed this phenomenon by proposing a perfusion system for adenovirus production to alleviate nutrient limitations caused by high cell density cultures. For this study, it was decided to keep producing AAV by transfecting cells at the cell density of 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL until other means of medium replacement or fed-batch techniques are developed or additives are found to improve the transfection efficiency and AAV yield.",

In some cases, the use of sodium butyrate had increased (Backliwal et al., 2008; Hunt et al., 2002; Jiang and Sharfstein, 2008; Sena-Esteves et al., 2004 ) the yield of proteins and viruses, and in other cases, it had no effect (Sena-Esteves et al., 2004) . In the present study, although the expression levels of the transgene in the transfected cells were directly proportional to the concentrations of sodium butyrate or butyric acid, their use did not contribute to increase the yield of AAV production. Based on the high expression of GFP protein, the addition of sodium butyrate or butyric acid would also have produced Rep proteins in excess. The Rep proteins have a toxic effect on HEK293 cells (Chang and Shenk, 1990; Chang et al., 1989; Clark et al., 1995; Li et al., 1997; Yang et al., 1994; Zhou and Trempe, 1999) ; therefore, the low AAV yield in the presence of sodium butyrate or butyric acid could be due to accumulation of other toxic proteins in the cell culture environment. Lentivirus production by HEK293 cells has been increased by the use of sodium butyrate (Ansorge et al., 2009; Karolewski et al., 2003) and caffeine (Ellis et al., 2011) . AAV2 production was not increased by sodium butyrate (present study) or caffeine (Ellis et al., 2011) using HEK293 cells. However, an increase in AAV production has been shown by the addition of 5 mM sodium butyrate when the insect cells/baculovirus system was used and baculovirus-mediated transduction of HEK 293 cells gave higher AAV yield by the addition of sodium butyrate .",

            "text": "Kinetics of AAV production showed that the infectious titers lagged behind the genomic particle titers most likely because their maturation into infectious particles took place after the formation of capsids and encapsidation of the viral genome (Fig. 6 ). Viral genomic (Vg) particles started to accumulate as early as 12 hpt however, IVP were not seen until 24 hpt. This could be due to 12 h sampling interval and sensitivity of assay. The genomic viral particles are produced earlier and infective viral particles are matured later. Myers and Carter (1980) showed by radioactive pulse chase labeling method that AAV capsid proteins assemble into empty capsids very quickly. Their experiment suggested that these empty capsids are later transferred to DNA-containing full particles or defective-interfering particles. They further showed that the maturation to stable full particles took much longer in terms of several hours whereas, empty capsids appeared very rapidly. The GFP positive cells remained same after 24 hpt suggesting that there was no secondary infection seen for AAV2 (Figs. 6 and 9c). Xiao (2010) argued that AAV2, AAV6 and AAV8RQNR (a mutant that binds strongly to HSPG) would show less particles in free medium because of re-adsorption onto the cell membrane and re-entry into the live cells, resulting in a low AAV yield because of the un-coating and degradation of re-entered viruses. This argument implies that there should be at least a small increase in the number of transduced cells at a later stage of AAV production because of an equal probability of adsorption by non-transfected cells. An increase in GFP positive cells was not observed (Figs. 6 and 9c) . The low Vg/IVP ratio of less than 20 at 48 hpt in cell culture indicated acceptable encapsidation of AAV2 vectors achieved by transfection technology using HEK293SF cells.",

The infectious viral particle assay used HEK293 cells, but the AAV serotypes had different specificities for this cell line. The infectious viral particle productions reflected by the infectivity assay are provided only to demonstrate that different AAV serotypes produced using this scalable process are functional in terms of infectivity. The results indicated that the HEK293 or HeLa cell lines used for the transduction (infectivity) assay had variable \"permissiveness\" to different AAV serotypes. The titers published should be carefully evaluated because they are highly dependent on the type of assays used to determine the total or functional titers. A cellbased assay should be used only when the titers from the same serotypes are compared to determine functionality loss during the vector processing, and genomic particles by PCR based assay may be used when titers from the same or different serotypes are compared (Grieger et al., 2006) . The quantitation of AAV has been reviewed by Aucoin et al. (2008) . It is strongly suggested that any comparison with the data published in the literature should be done with great care considering different expression systems and different quantitation methods used.",

Although the total cells continued to increase, after 40 hpt, the cell viability started to decrease. The bioreactor experiment provided similar yields as observed in the shake flask experiments for similar conditions demonstrating scalability of the process. The time of harvest may be set preferentially between 48 and 64 hpt (Fig. 9) . The volumetric production of infectious and genomic viral particles remained constant around 6.8 \u00d7 10 11 IVP/L and 1.0 \u00d7 10 13 Vg/L, respectively, between 48 and 72 hpt. The cell specific yields of 6800 Vg/cell and 460 IVP/cell were obtained for AAV2. Using different plasmid constructs and medium selection providing better conditions, an improvement from earlier yields (Durocher et al., 2007) has been reported with better encapsidation (Vg/IVP ratio \u223c15) at a higher cell density of 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL and without any medium exchange. The HEK293T cells adapted to a \"loose\" suspension in a 2-L bioreactor at a cell density of 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL with FBS gave a cell-specific yield of 345 \u00b1 154 IVP/cell; the genomic particles per cell were not reported (Park et al., 2006) . Generally, the HEK293T produced higher cell-specific infectious particles than HEK293 cells (261 IVP/HEK293T cells vs. 44 IVP/HEK293 cells) (Park et al., 2006) . Yuan et al. (2011) produced single stranded (ssAAV) and self-complementing (scAAV) AAV vectors of serotypes AAV2, AAV8, and AAV9 by the AAV producer cell line and triple transfection. The group reported 5-8 \u00d7 10 13 vector genomic particles of AAV2 per Nunc Cell Factory and 1.3 \u00d7 10 5 genomic particles per cell. Their cell line produced AAV2 vectors with Vg/transducing units (TU) ratio of 85 and Vg/TU ratio of 480 by triple transfection method. Lock et al. (2010) produced AAV1, 6, 7, 8 and 9 by transient transfection at small scale using anchorage dependent cells with yields in the range of 0.5-3 \u00d7 10 5 genome copies/cell. Their ten liter productions of AAV6, 8 and 9 gave yields in the range of 3 \u00d7 10 13 to 1 \u00d7 10 15 genome copies by anchorage dependent cells. Although the cells during production were grown in serum free medium, but were kept in 10% fetal bovine serum prior to the transfection. Grieger and Samulski (2012) reported high AAV yields using a HEK293 cell line that was selected for high transfection efficiency and high AAV production. This cell line was able to produce >10 5 Vg/cell in a serum-free suspension cell culture. This shows that there is a great potential yet to be explored to optimize the cell lines for better optimization of transfection efficiencies.",

Combining low MOI and a fed-batch production strategy, it was shown that the insect cells/baculovirus system AAV yield can be increased seven-fold. Approximately 2 \u00d7 10 14 Vg/L and 2 \u00d7 10 12 IVP/mL cell culture were obtained in the bioreactor experiment at a harvest cell density of 9.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL (Mena et al., 2010) , which is proportionally similar to cell specific production by transfection at low cell density reported in this manuscript. From a process standpoint, it is remarkable that despite limited process improvements and operation at low cell density, the large scale transient transfection technology performs as well as the baculovirus/insect cell technology for production of AAV serotypes. Again, this underlines the yet non-exploited potential of the transient transfection in HEK293 cell suspension cultures for high yield and large scale industrial production of AAV 1-9 serotypes evaluated in this study, which is further supported by recent work by Grieger and Samulski (2012) . Also, based on the data from this study it can be said with confidence that other serotypes can be easily produced at larger scales in the cGMP HEK293SF cell line using the presented generic protocol.",

Three bioreactor runs showed that the yields are comparable to shake-flask runs for the corresponding serotypes and therefore shows the potential to scale-up and industrialization of this generic process for manufacturing efficiently AAV serotypes.",
