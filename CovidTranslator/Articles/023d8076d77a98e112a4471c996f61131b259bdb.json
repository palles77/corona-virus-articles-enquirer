Only then did the Taiwanese government begin to institute international epidemic prevention measures and take steps to isolate and quarantine those who wereinfected. However, those steps were not taken in time to prevent further outbreaks of nosocomial SARS infection in several Taiwanese hospitals. In total, there were 3021 suspected cases of SARS; 346 were confirmed and there were 73 deaths. Many more people were placed in home quarantine. There were two classes of home quarantine. The 50,319 individuals placed in Level A home quarantine had been in close contact with a patient with SARS and were quarantined for 10 to 14 days. Another 80,813 individuals were placed in Level B quarantine. These individuals were travelers arriving on flights from World Health Organization (WHO)-designated SARS-affected areas; they were quarantined for 10 days either at home, airport hotels, or government quarantine centers. 1 The events related to the SARS outbreak had an enormous impact on the public health and economy of Taiwan. 1 In this article, the authors describe the Taiwanese efforts to stem the spread of the disease and the role of Taiwan's military nurses during the epidemic. The authors discuss the public and private impact on the Taiwanese people and those military nurses who cared for patients with SARS or suspected SARS.",

At the beginning of the transfer of patients from Taipei hospitals to SongShan Armed Forces Hospital, nursing staff from both institutions found themselves at odds with the mission of containing the SARS epidemic and usual standards of nursing practice. Many usual patient care treatments were delayed or not done because of the environmental conditions (lack of air conditioning, discomfort, and protective clothing impediment); strict isolation measures; and the procedures put into place to handle the crisis. For example, nursing staff could not provide nebulizer inhalation treatments because of the restrictions in place to prevent the spread of SARS. Thus, there were limited treatment options when patients with SARS, who were too weak to cough and clear their airways, became short of breath from obstructed airways, which conflicted with what the nurses believed was ethical nursing practice. The nursing staff experienced a sense of severe powerlessness and guilt from these conflicts. [19] [20] [21] [22] There was also stress associated with caring for isolated and frightened patients. Patients with SARS were very frightened because of the strict quarantine interventions and because of the unknown characteristics of the virus itself. The patients exhibited symptoms of panic, emotional instability, and insomnia. Some even refused to cooperate with preventative isolation interventions, such as wearing facemasks. Some patients left the hospital without permission. The nursing staff was required to deal with these patients' fears and issues on a daily basis. The stress felt by the nursing staff exceeded the usual day-to-day stressors of nursing. There was a documented increase in the incidence of mental illness among the nursing staff involved with patients with SARS. 23 Social stressors experienced by medical caregivers were especially heightened. The SARS outbreak was so terrifying that no one wanted family members to risk their lives caring for patients with SARS. Families also did not want to risk possible exposure to themselves by having a member working in the SARS hospitals. Consequently, some families refused to support the nurses' work. Not only did they try to stop the nurses from going to work but some even threatened the nurses with termination of their kin relationship. This added a social stress for the nurses.",

            "text": "On January 20, 2004 , the Center for Disease Control disseminated the new version of the Communicable Disease Control Act. This Act defined infectious diseases and subdivided them into five categories. The categories were determined by degrees of risk, speed of transmission and mortality rates. SARS was placed in the first category, making it comparable to smallpox and plague. Other categories include specified infectious diseases, such as the avian flu and unknown emerging infectious. 28 The Act also spells out hospital related duties and implementation of control and preventive practices. 28, 29 All the policies put into place after the SARS epidemic highlight the importance of hospital infection control they have permanently changed practices of health care providers. Some protective strategies include hand-washing habits, proper use of protective equipment, management of visitors and private duty nursing assistants, use of specific cleaning and disinfecting solutions, medical waste disposal, and safeguarding the environment. 1, 30 There were many lessons learned from the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. Because of the flexibility and sense of duty common among military personnel, SongShan Armed Forces General Hospital was able to quickly change its mission to provide first-line health care to patients with SARS during the epidemic. The value shown by the military nursing staff in the fight against SARS significantly impressed the citizens of the Taiwanese nation. The roles and mission that uniformed service nurses preformed was impressive. Their experiences and the hardships they endured provided valuable lessons for future health care crises. Although the impact of SARS greatly affected nursing staff physically and psychologically, it also provided them the opportunity to reflect on issues related to the nursing profession. With regard to nursing practice, nurses should have an increased awareness of emerging infectious diseases. Stress-management methods can help them deal with some of the difficulties experienced during public health crises. The authors think these lessons can only strengthen the dignity of the profession and enhance nurses' abilities for future emergent events. 20 The SARS epidemic in Taiwan ushered in a new era for infectious-disease treatment and prevention in epidemic control and the development of specific management strategies.",
