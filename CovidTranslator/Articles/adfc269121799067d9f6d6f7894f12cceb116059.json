Interventions: The neutralizing antihuman C5a antibody (IFX-1) was administered to investigate the new treatment strategy for paraquat-induced systemic inflammatory responses in cynomolgus macaque model. In addition, C5a activation in plasma of paraquat patients was blocked by IFX-1 to investigate the blockade role of anti-C5a antibody in activation of inflammatory cells. Measurements and Main Results: Dysregulated complement activation and the subsequent cytokine storm were found in patients with acute lung injury and in a primate model of paraquat poisoning. Targeted inhibition of C5a by IFX-1 led to marked alleviation of systemic inflammatory responses and multiple organ damage in the primate model. In addition, blockade of C5a activity in plasma from patients completely inhibited activation of CD11b on blood granulocytes from normal donors, suggesting that IFX-1 may alleviate the excessive activation of inflammatory responses and have clinical utility for patients with acute lung injury. Conclusions: Anti-C5a antibodies such as IFX-1 may be used as effective therapeutics for treatment of those suffering from systemic inflammatory responses induced by chemical poisoning like paraquat.

However, once dysregulated, it can turn against host cells and is involved in numerous diseases and pathologic conditions such as inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and infectious diseases (1) . Complement activation products such as C5a play an important role in mediating proinflammatory activity and regulating modulatory signals (2) (3) (4) . Thus, regulation of complement activation is a promising treatment strategy (5, 6) . Regulating C5a or C5aR has proven beneficial in animal models of transplantation, sepsis, arthritis, and cancer (7-9).

The remaining authors have disclosed that they do not have any potential conflicts of interest. Our previous studies showed that aberrant complement activation plays an important role in H5N1-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in a mouse model (10) and that targeted blockade of C5a alleviates H7N9-induced ALI in an African Green Monkey model (11) . We also demonstrated aberrant complement activation after paraquat poisoning in a mouse model, suggesting that it plays a major role in paraquat-induced ALI (12) . ALI is characterized by severe lung damage accompanied by a protein-rich pulmonary edema (13) . Lung injury is caused primarily by damage to endothelial and epithelial barriers and is closely associated with activation and infiltration by neutrophils (14) . Clinically, the main cause of ALI is bacterial or viral pneumonia, along with sepsis, transfusions, drug reactions, or chemical reagents (15) . Although lung-protective ventilator strategies have reduced mortality, no effective pharmacologic therapy is available (16, 17) . Thus, an effective means of preventing, alleviating, or retarding systemic inflammatory responses is required.",

Interaction of C5a with C5aR could activate neutrophils and monocytes to generate oxidative burst with release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (24, 25) , whereas interception of C5a-C5aR signaling significantly inhibited oxidative burst in neutrophils induced with Escherichia coli. and in whole blood induced with Neisseria meningitides (26, 27) .

However, little is known about the role of aberrant complement activation in paraquat-induced ALI. Here, we established a cynomolgus macaque model of paraquat-induced ALI to better understand the role of complement and to identify therapeutic targets. After paraquat administration, the monkeys showed typical ALI characteristics, including scattered hyperemia, thickened alveolar septa, and infiltration of inflammatory cells accompanied by cellular degeneration and/or necrosis (Supplemental Fig. 2A , Supplemental Digital Content 4, http:// links.lww.com/CCM/D162; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159). At 6 hours, after paraquat administration, the serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IP-10, and MCP-1 were marked higher than those in control animals (Supplemental Fig. 2B , Supplemental Digital Content 4, http:// links.lww.com/CCM/D162; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159). The concentration of C3a, C5a, and C5b-9, indicators of complement activation, was also significantly higher in paraquat-treated animals at the same time point (Supplemental Fig. 3A , Supplemental Digital Content 5, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D163; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159). Paraquat up-regulated expression of C3aR and C5aR in lung tissues relative to that in normal lung tissues. Deposition of C3c was greater in lung tissues from paraquat-treated animals than in those from untreated animals (Supplemental Fig. 3B , Supplemental Digital Content 5, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D163; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/ CCM/D159). Taken together, these data further support aberrant activation of the complement system. One may argue that the route of administration of paraquat to macaques is different from that to the patients with paraquat poisoning as mentioned above. Because of the difficulty to control the amount of paraquat applied orally due to the severe vomit, we had to administer paraquat intraperitoneally according to the dynamic distribution and absorption of paraquat (30, 31) and obtained reproducible results which consistent with those from testing the blood samples of the patients with paraquat poisoning.",

We found that the number of lymphocytes and eosinophils decreased significantly after paraquat administration, whereas the number of neutrophils and monocytes increased. Surprisingly, in contrast to the sham treatment group, the IFX-1 treatment group had fewer neutrophils (p < 0.001) and monocytes (p < 0.05) at 16 hours post paraquat administration. Compared with the sham treatment group, the IFX-1-treated group showed a sharp decrease in CRP, CRE, BUN, ALT, and AST levels, suggesting that IFX-1 reduced acute systemic inflammatory responses induced by paraquat. In addition, IFX-1 shortened the PT (p < 0.05), indicating that the antibody also inhibited the coagulation cascade (Supplemental Fig. 4 , Supplemental Digital Content 6, http:// links.lww.com/CCM/D164; legend, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D159).

Microscopic observation of lungs from shamtreated cynomolgus macaques at 16 hours post paraquat administration showed hemorrhagic alveolar damage characterized by scattered hyperemia, thickened alveolar septa, and infiltration by moderate numbers of neutrophils and macrophages, and degeneration or necrosis of the alveolar epithelium, with vacuolization of pneumocytes or with karyorrhexis and loss of cellular detail. Less exudation and some foamy alveolar macrophages and scattered neutrophils and erythrocytes were also observed in the alveolar lumen. However, the lungs of IFX-1-treated animals showed less severe damage, with some thickening of alveolar septa (Fig. 4B;  and Supplemental Fig. 6 SP-A is a pulmonary surfactant primarily responsible for reducing surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli and plays an important role in the innate host defense and regulation of the inflammatory process in the lung (34) .

            "text": "The complement system is a key upstream sensor and effector system whose activation products are important regulators of immunologic and inflammatory processes; however, they also participate in many diseases and disorders (1). C5a is a major anaphylatoxin and exerts strong proinflammatory effects by targeting a broad spectrum of immune and nonimmune cells, affecting the migration of macrophages and neutrophils, and inducing synthesis of other chemotactic factors (2, 24) . Furthermore, C5a triggers an oxidative burst in macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils and increases TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 gene expression and protein synthesis by macrophages (39) . In a previous study, we showed that IFX-1 reduced serum levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in African Green Monkeys infected with H7N9 virus (11) . Here, we used a monkey model of paraquat-induced ALI to show that IFX-1 reduced the number of inflammatory cell infiltrating in lung, as well as levels of CRP, BUN, ALT and IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, thereby reducing injury to the lung, spleen, kidney, and intestine. Altered permeability of the alveolar endothelial and epithelial barriers remains a central pathophysiologic event in ALI. Indeed, the pulmonary endothelium plays a key role in the development of ALI (40, 41) . Once activated, endothelial cells secrete cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and MCP-1, which recruit neutrophils and macrophages and contribute to collateral cell damage and organ dysfunction. Zeng et al (42) demonstrated that H5N1-induced damage to pulmonary endothelial cells triggered host inflammatory responses and that C5a may participate in endothelial activation and affect expression of adhesion molecules. We found that IFX-1 increased VE-cadherin expression and alleviated lung lesions, suggesting that decreased activation of endothelial cells and an improved endothelial barrier in the lung contribute to an improved outcome. IFX-1 may also preserve lung function, as evidenced by the increased SP-A level in treated animals. SP-A is closely associated with lung structure and innate immune responses. It is unclear whether alveolar epithelial injury is primary to paraquat insult or secondary to lung endothelial injury. Nonetheless, it is evident that damage to epithelial and endothelial cells converges on a common pathway, resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. As such, reduced endothelial activation and protection of lung epithelial cells may be a potential mechanism underlying C5a blockade.",

Different from other complement blocking agents such as eculizumab, IFX-1 provides effective and specific blockade of C5a without disturbing the C5b assembly arm required for MAC formation (11) ; this may play an important role in host defense against secondary bacterial and fungal pneumonia that typically occurs in patients who suffer from ALI. Previously, we showed that IFX-1 effectively inhibits eC5a in humans and African Green Monkeys, thereby alleviating lung injury induced by H7N9 virus (11) . Here, we found that C5a remained at basal levels after IFX-1 treatment, indicating that C5a can be effectively blocked without affecting the upstream pathways of complement activation.",
