However, other vasculitic conditions are thought to be linked to viral infections because of a similarity with viral illness with respect to the age and the time of onset of the disease even though no defi nite organism has been identifi ed. In this article, we discuss current knowledge with regard to the etiology, epidemiology, pathology, and the possible treatments of viral-induced vasculitis.",
