There are no specific drugs or vaccines against COVID-19, thus effective antiviral agents are still urgently needed to combat this virus. Herein, the FEP (free energy perturbation)-based screening strategy is newly derived as a rapid protocol to accurately reposition potential agents against COVID-19 by targeting viral proteinase Mpro. Restrain energy distribution (RED) function was derived to optimize the alchemical pathway of FEP, which greatly accelerated the calculations and first made FEP possible in the virtual screening of the FDA-approved drugs database. As a result, fifteen out of twenty-five drugs validated in vitro exhibited considerable inhibitory potencies towards Mpro. Among them, the most potent Mpro inhibitor dipyridamole potentially inhibited NF-\uf06bB signaling pathway and inflammatory responses, and has just finished the first round clinical trials. Our result demonstrated that the FEP-based screening showed remarkable advantages in prompting drug repositioning against COVID-19.",

On March 22, there were 813,00 confirmed COVID-19 cases including 3,253 deaths in China. This virus has also infected more than 220,000 patients in all of the continents and over 180 other countries, such as Italy, Spain, U.S.A, Germany, France, and Iran gradually became a global pandemic due to the very high risk of spread and impact of COVID-19. To date, there is no specific treatment or vaccine against COVID-19, thus it is urgently need to repositioning potential agents against COVID- 19. 3 The COVID-19's replicase gene encodes two over-lapping translation products, polyproteins 1a and 1ab (pp1a and pp1ab), which mediate all of the functions required for viral replication. Mpro, as the key enzyme in proteolytic processing of viral replication, is initially released by the auto-cleavage of pp1a and pp1ab. Then Mpro in turn cleaves pp1a and pp1ab to release functional proteins necessary for viral replication. 4 In the view of essential functions of Mpro in viral life cycle and its high conservatism, it is an attractive target for the discovery of anti-COVID-19 agents.",

As a result, six drugs inhibited Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.67 to 21.4 \u03bcM. 5 These drug design methods contributed considerably to the lead discovery, but the computational accuracy and efficiency need to be improved especially when dealing with emergency situations such as the COVID-19 outbreak. Free energy perturbation (FEP) method is a promising method with satisfactory accuracy [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , but their actual applications to drug design are still limited to simulate minor structural changes of the ligands, thus predicting the relative binding free energy (RBFE). 7, 14 In order to perform virtual screening of a large molecule database, the absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculation must be performed for each ligand without using of a reference ligand structure. The FEP approach has an advantage in predicting the affinities more precisely between drugs and their targets than conventional methods, such as pharmacophore, molecule docking, and molecular simulations. However, the FEP-ABFE approaches are extremely expensive/time-consumpting and therefore not used for virtual screening purpose. 15, 16 To accelerate the discovery of Mpro inhibitors from the small molecule database to combat COVID-19, we represent a newly derived FEP-ABFE-accelerated screening strategy together with bioassay validation to rapidly reposition potential agents against COVID-19 by targeting viral proteinase Mpro.",

Considering Mpro being a protease, Cys145-His41/Ser144-His163 can act as the nucleophilic agent and acid that assist the hydrolysis reaction of the substrate proteins, and Gly143 and Gln166 can form hydrogen bonds with the \"CO-NH-C\u03b1-CO-NH-C\u03b1\" structure of the backbone of the substrate protein.

As shown in the thermodynamic cycle, a restraint should be added to the receptor and ligand for each FEP calculation. The strategy of adding restraints first reported by Boresch et al. 26 was used in this study, which consists of one distance, two angles, and three dihedrals harmonic potentials with a force constant of 10 kcal/mol/\u00c5 2 [rad 2 ]. The contribution of the restraints to the Lig (\u2206 ) system was calculated analytically, and the contribution of the restraint to the Rec-Lig system (\u2206 ) was calculated by FEP. According to the strategy, three atoms of the ligand and three atoms of the receptor will be selected to add the restraint. In order to add the restraints at the equilibrium position, a program was designed to automatically detect the required parameters and select the three ligand atoms and the three receptors atoms. For ligand, the heavy atom which is closest to the geometry center was selected as the first atom; the heavy atom which is most distant from the first atom was selected as the second atom; the heavy atom forms an angle that is larger than 90 degrees with the first two atoms and most distant from the first atom is selected as the third atom. For the receptor, based on the last 2 ns trajectory of the 4 ns preliminary MD simulations, the distances, angles, dihedrals between the three ligand atoms and C\u03b1, Cc (carbon of the carboxyl group) and N (N atom of the amino group) atoms of all the residues within 5 \u00c5 of the ligand were calculated along the MD trajectory. C\u03b1, Cc and N atoms from the same residue with the most stable (lowest standard deviation) distances, angles, and dihedrals values were selected as the three receptor atoms. The determined mean values of distance, angles, and dihedrals were used for adding the restraints between the three ligand atoms and the three receptor atoms. ",

The free energies of adding restraints are 0.912 and 0.948 kcal/mol for the 12-\u03bb perturbation and the one-step perturbation, respectively, which means the convergence for the one-step perturbation is pretty good. In order to further justify the applicability of one-step perturbation (2 \u03bb with values of 0.0 and 1.0, denoted as 2 \u03bb below) in adding restraints, three different targets and 28 ligands were tested to compare the \u2206A restr RL results calculated from 12 \u03bb and 2 \u03bb. The bond, angle, and dihedral parameters for the restraints are the same for 12 \u03bb and 2 \u03bb calculations. Table S1 summarized the results for the \u2206A restr RL , and the calculation results revealed that the single-step perturbation have good convergence with the energy difference for all the tested systems less than 0.5 kcal/mol. Thus, by using automatic restrain adding program and fitting the sampled (\u2206 ) by RED function, the calculation resources needed for adding restraints can be greatly decreased while keeping the accuracy.",

In theory, the \"double-peak\" shape distribution (\u2206 ) will happen when relative position between the receptor and ligand, which we use to determine the ligand restraints addition parameters, is far from the equilibrium state, and at the same time, the harmonic potentials used to apply the restraint are not strong enough. According to FEP theory, the probability distribution near the lower tail of (\u2206 ) will greatly influence the accuracy of \u2206 calculation. The \"double-peak\" shape of the probability distribution is far from the equilibrium, and the distribution pattern near the lower tail varies from time to time during the simulation, which will result in a very unstable free energy estimation. Thus, to deal with the instability in energy calculation, in the reported studies 1, 2 , the restraints are added with more than 10 \u03bb values, and the first several \u03bb are selected rather close to each other (0.0, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1). Although the purpose of the RED function is to describe the (\u2206 ) when the restraints are added near the equilibrium state, the RED function can also describe the (\u2206 ) well even when restraints are not added near the equilibrium. Using the forward perturbation from 0.00 to 0.01 as an example, which is shown in Figure S2 , when the added restrain is relatively weak and not at the equilibrium position, the peak on the right which is described by the Gaussian term of the RED function is caused by the ligand occupying the equilibrium position, and the peak on the left is caused by the added restraints which is described by the harmonic energy term of the RED function.

As can be seen in Table S2 , by using 16 \u03bb values in total (2 \u03bb for restrain with fitting by RED function, 5 \u03bb for charge, and 9 \u03bb for vdW) the energy calculation results are quite close to that calculated by using 42 \u03bb values for all the 4 systems tested (all the energy differences are within 1 kcal/mol). Compared with 42 \u03bb, FEP-ABFE calculation using just 16 \u03bb values need only 38 % computation resources, and the calculation is accelerated by more than 2.5 times.
