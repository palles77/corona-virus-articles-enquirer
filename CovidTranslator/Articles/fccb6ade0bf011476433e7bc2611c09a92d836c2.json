Those advances include insights into phage therapy, cancer biology, host-parasite interactions, reproductive biology, and pathogen outbreaks. In discussing them, I have not aimed for scholarly reviews that cover all major contributions: space is too limited, recent reviews of each are available elsewhere, and such treatment could bore the reader. Instead I have chosen topics I find exciting using recent references that provide entry to the rapidly expanding literature.

It is becoming the therapy of choice in cases where bacterial strains that resist all available antibiotics threaten critically ill patients with hospital-acquired infections. Phage do not attack the eukaryotic cells of patients, nor do they induce anaphylaxis, but they do elicit the production of anti-phage antibodies that can dampen their impact without necessarily resulting in treatment failure. Following a long history of success in humans in Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland and Georgia, and recent demonstrations of efficacy in animal models, phage therapy has succeeded in treating two cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in Belgium and the US and is currently the focus of a large scale trial in France, Belgium, and Switzerland that aims to prevent burn infections (Kakasis and Panitsa 2019) . damage, septicemia caused by P. aeruginosa emerged, and the patient went into a coma. With emergency clearance from administrative authorities, a 50 ml purified phage cocktail was then administered intravenously for 6 h each day for 10 days at the same time that the wounds were directly irrigated with the same cocktail every 8 h for 10 days. Improvement was dramatic: blood cultures turned negative almost immediately, temperature returned to normal in about 2 days, and blood tests used to assess infections returned to normal range within a week. Unfortunately, the patient died 4 months later in the hospital from heart failure mediated by sepsis caused by Klebsiella.",

The infection resolved and did not recur. That team has gone on to treat seven more cases (Chan pers. comm.) , five with cystic fibrosis (CF) and two with non-CF bronchiectasis, a type of COPD in which the bronchi are damaged, mucus accumulates, and bacteria grow in the accumulated mucus. Those seven cases were treated by inhaling an aerosol. In all seven improvement was observed; in one case of non-CF bronchiectasis the lung infection was eradicated. Two more cases of CF with multiple-resistant bacterial infections are currently being treated.",

Attempts to target specific molecular mechanisms of resistance have had little success because of the diverse mechanisms present among the genetically differing clones. Chemotherapy aimed at one mechanism simply allows cells using other mechanisms to increase. Treating with maximum doses also hastens the expansion of resistant clones by reducing competition with susceptible clones. These insights were initially explored in models that showed that patient survival could be increased by modulating chemotherapy to maintain a stable population of sensitive clones that can suppress resistant clones in the absence of chemotherapy (Gatenby et al. 2009 ), a result later confirmed by modeling the specific case of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (Cunningham et al. 2018 ). This approach, called adaptive therapy, can only be done safely with cancers whose growth can be followed with imaging or other methods, for it is essential to know when the tumor burden has been stabilized. A key insight is that although the evolution of resistance to every currently available therapy is inevitable, the expansion of resistant cells is not: it can be delayed, perhaps indefinitely, with interventions based on understanding clonal dynamics . With proof-of-principle now demonstrated in model systems that include mice (Gatenby et al. 2009 ) and cultures of human breast cancer cells (Silva et al. 2012) , the approach has moved into a Phase 1 clinical trial (Gatenby pers. comm.) .",

Because every cell in the body contains all the genetic information needed to carry out the functions of all cells at all stages of life, it would make sense that organisms with cells that can invade the endometrium during implantation would contain adult cells that could reactivate those capacities as metastatic cells capable of moving among tissues and establishing themselves in new environments. Molecular evidence indicates that the same genetic networks are deployed in placental and in cancer cells (Ferretti et al. 2007 ). The phylogenetic evidence suggests that invasion was the ancestral state in Eutheria. Invasion involves two actors: fetal cells invade, and maternal cells resist. The comparative evidence suggests that the ancestral state, fetal invasion, was countered by maternal resistance that was stronger in ungulates than in carnivores (D'Souza and Wagner 2014).",

Both types of bovine cells were more resistant to invasion than were either type of human cells. Moreover, genes with higher expression in human than in bovine fibroblasts were identified, and when they were knocked down in human fibroblasts, those cells resisted invasion significantly more strongly. This work suggests that the permissiveness of stromal tissue to invasion is a single character involved in both the invasion of the endometrium by fetal cells and the invasion of various tissues by metastatic cells (Gupta et al. 2019 ).

This approach has been successful in treating patients whose cancers are associated with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, which increase the risk of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer (Ashworth and Lord 2018) . The evolutionary twist comes from noting that many pairs of synthetic lethals are functionally redundant paralogs. One research opportunity for those with skills in molecular evolution is the efficient identification of paralog synthetic lethal pairs in platforms tailored for genomic analysis of cancers; this would enable a broader range of individualized therapies (Hu pers. comm.).

That fact gave special force to the results of one of the first phylogenetic analyses of metastases. It compared metastases from pancreatic cancers in seven individuals, finding that a decade elapsed between the initiating mutation and the birth of the non-metastatic founder cell and that at least five more years elapsed before metastasis began, after which patients died within an average of another 2 years (Yachida et al. 2010) . The insight that oncologists had a much longer time than had been thought in which to detect such a cancer helped to motivate the many subsequent phylogenetic analyses of metastases. One issue that such studies seek to resolve is whether metastases spread from metastasis to metastasis or as parallel metastases from a primary tumor. Simply observing the monophyly of metastases does not distinguish between those options; doing so requires ultra-deep sequencing to identify the complete phylogeny of clones within the primary tumor (Hong et al. 2015) . A later study demonstrated that in fact metastases can originate from different lineages within the primary tumor; confirmed that metastatic lineages arise early within primary tumors, often long before diagnosis, focusing attention on identifying driver mutations that originate early; and showed that the sequence in which driver mutations arise can be inferred from the phylogeny, thus informing strategies for targeted therapies (Zhao et al. 2016) . It is clear that the harvest of insights into cancer biology from molecular phylogenetics has been fruitful (Naxerova and Jain 2015) and is not yet complete.",

Two patterns stimulated it. The first was the temporal correlation, in developed countries, between a striking increase in the incidence of autoimmune diseases and the decrease in infectious diseases in the twentieth century. The second was the lack of autoimmune diseases in tropical countries in which helminth infections are widespread. Those two patterns, one in time, the other in space, suggested the idea that cleaning up our environment had the unintended side effect of perturbing our microbiota so seriously that immune pathologies resulted. Initially, helminths were the prime suspect, for their life histories suggest that they should have highly developed capacities to manipulate the immune responses of their hosts. Helminths suffer huge mortality losses in transmission among hosts, losses that can only be balanced by long persistence and high fecundity once established in a host, functions greatly aided by ability to manipulate the host immune system. Other pathogens, parasites, and symbionts have also experienced major challenges as their human hosts acquired them and then domesticated themselves via the agricultural, industrial, and epidemiological revolutions, a series of rapid cultural changes that have left our biology in general and our microbiota in particular mismatched to our current environment (Rook 2012) . If removing an element of our microbiota, such as helminths, results in immune pathologies, then identifying what helminths are doing when they are present should yield clues to therapies for autoimmune diseases that include Type I diabetes, the various irritable bowel syndromes (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease), multiple sclerosis, allergies, asthma, and others. Such therapies are sorely needed, for up until now, physicians have usually only been able to treat the symptoms, not the causes, of autoimmune diseases, most of which cause great suffering. Some can kill.",

In human females, the ovaries form in the fetus in the third month and are stocked with about 7 million primary oocytes that are arrested in prophase I of meiosis. The process of oocytic atresia then starts to decrease that number. Roughly a million are left at birth, a few thousand when a young woman starts to menstruate at menarche, when oocytes start to be recruited for ovulation (Kerr et al. 2013 ). The process continues at a less dramatic pace until the number of follicles drops below the endocrine threshold needed to sustain ovulation and menstruation and the woman enters menopause. Thus, women start with a finite number of primary oocytes and steadily lose them (some replacement may be possible Kerr et al. 2013 ) until they run out. In contrast, sperm are not produced in the testes until puberty. Spermatogonia then continue to undergo mitosis and meiosis throughout life, producing millions of sperm per day. When the concentration of male sex hormones starts to decline between the ages of 40 and 60, sperm production decreases, but it usually only ceases completely with death.",

The mechanisms involved are being discovered: one is DNAdamage-induced apoptosis of resting oocytes mediated by p63, a member of the p53 family (Tuppi et al. 2018) . Oocyte death can also be triggered by defects in the synapsis and recombination of chromosomes during meiosis that produce double strand breaks, which also induce apoptosis (Qiao et al. 2018 ). While we know that many defective oocytes are eliminated, and some of the mechanisms involved, we do not yet have good estimates of the average quality of a random oocyte selected at each age of a random female's life, and thus, especially given the possibility of some replacement, cannot yet provide a reliable answer to the question, Does oocytic atresia improve egg quality? There is some evidence that quality control deteriorates with age: the percentage of trisomies in recognized pregnancies increases from 2 to 3% at ages 15-25 to 25-35% at ages 40 and over, with a striking acceleration in incidence starting at ages 32-33 (Crow 2000b) . Does atresia reduce the rate at which damage increases with maternal age? Clearly there are intriguing research opportunities with significant therapeutic implications in the age-related molecular population genetics of oocytes and in the study of the age-related mechanisms that mediate their quality. We need direct molecular evidence for or against the idea that the genetic quality of eggs is improved by atresia.",

This striking question has stimulated several hypotheses on why menopause evolved. One, the Grandmother Hypothesis, sees menopause as an adaptation that allows an aged female to gain more fitness by helping her offspring rear grandchildren than she would by having another child herself at an age when she might not be able to care for it properly until it was independent (Hawkes et al. 1998 ). The Grandmother Hypothesis has stimulated a substantial literature; while there is some support, overall evidence is mixed (e.g. Strassmann and Garrard 2011) . A second hypothesis views menopause not as an adaptation but as a byproduct of quality control, the end result of finally running out of oocytes subject to continual atresia (Stearns and Ebert 2001) . A third hypothesis combines the first two, viewing the postreproductive lifespan of human females as a consequence of decreased mortality rates (self-domestication) that allow them to survive to ages at which they run out of oocytes that are being filtered for quality control, at which point evolution then makes use of the presence of older females by adapting their behavior to grand-mothering (Ellison and Ottinger 2014) . Other possible causes include impacts on females mediated by intra-locus cross-sex effects that originate in selection on males, whose reproductive ability continues to greater ages than does that of females (Stearns et al. 2012) . While investigating the molecular population biology of oocytes and the age-dependent mechanisms that control their quality will not by itself discriminate among these hypotheses-that will require case-control studies of lifetime reproductive success-it will provide relevant information that will advance the discussion and constrain the range of plausible ideas.",

That has been followed by 14 outbreaks, the largest of which occurred in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in 2013-2016; the most recent continues at this writing in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The case fatality rate has ranged from 47 to 89%, and the basic reproductive number R o --the number of new cases originating by transmission from a patient-has been 1.5 to 2.5. Ebola is a strikingly deadly, moderately transmissible disease. The first case in the recent West African outbreak, which caused 28,646 cases and 11,323 deaths (Dudas et al. 2017) , occurred in late December 2013 in Guinea, to which it appears to have moved fairly recently from Central Africa (Holmes et al. 2016) . Molecular phylogeography, practically in real time, has allowed detailed reconstruction of its origin and spread, knowledge that will be quite helpful in dealing with future outbreaks (Dudas et al. 2017 ).",

Chimpanzees were the original hosts of HIV-1, which is the major cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is pathogenic in chimpanzees. Four lineages of HIV-1 have jumped into humans; one or two of those transmissions may have been via gorillas. Their close relatives are simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), which infect more than 40 species of monkeys without apparent pathogenesis. The virus lineage that has caused the AIDS pandemic probably entered humans in the extreme southeast corner of Cameroon (Sharp and Hahn 2010) when a hunter butchered an ape. Detailed study of HIV-1 genomes isolated from 1970s samples has shown that the virus was circulating in North America in the early 1970s, where it arrived in New York City from the Caribbean (Worobey et al. 2016 ).",

In 2007 it emerged on Yap Island in Micronesia with 49 confirmed cases, infecting about 75% of the population (many cases are asymptomatic); the next outbreak, with 396 cases and about 29,000 people infected, was in 2013 in French Polynesia, where more than 40 cases were linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a severe neuropathological autoimmune disease. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that it arrived in Brazil in 2013, where it quickly spread. By the end of 2016 it had appeared in at least 48 countries and territories in the Americas and was linked to microcephalic birth defects. During its expansion it acquired particular amino acid substitutions in the same lineages in which birth defects were detected; those substitutions, combined with reverse genetics in model organisms, are providing clues to its transmission and pathogenesis (Liu et al. 2019 ).",

How do bats tolerate viruses that are so virulent in humans? Several answers have been proposed. Bats have idiosyncratic immune responses restricted to specific viral infections for which they have long evolutionary experience, avoiding immunopathology via tolerance. Their daily flight and torpor, and the seasonal hibernation of some species, produce large variations in temperature and metabolic rate associated with evolved differences in the mechanisms that mediate oxidative stress. Those mechanisms, which manage reactive oxygen species, both allow them to live long lives despite expending about twice as much energy per lifetime as nonvolant mammals of comparable size and may help them to tolerate viral infections (Brook and Dobson 2015) . Clearly clues to treating some of the most virulent diseases known to man could be found in the tolerance mechanisms that bats have evolved.",
