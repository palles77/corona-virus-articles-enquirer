At about the same time the studies of Iwanowski and Beijerinck began to reveal the nature of a then unknown form of infectious agent of plants, and somewhat later a similar revelation emerged from the studies of Loeffler and Frosch on infected cattle. The ubiquity of this kind of agent was revealed by the studies of Twort and d'Herrelle who showed that bacteria too were susceptible to what became known as filterable viruses.",

The introduction by Woodruff and Goodpasture of the use of embryonated chick eggs as an animal virus host greatly stimulated research on animal viruses. The usefulness of this host was extended when Burnet developed a technique for infecting the cliorioallantoic membrane in a manner that resulted in discrete lesions (pocks) which could be readily recognized and enumerated. With the application of the plaque assay for bacterial viruses, and the pock-counting assay for animal viruses, the era of quantitative virology had its inception.",

One result of their extensive studies, which were summarized in great detail (Burnet et al., 1937) , was the conclusion that, with respect to their interaction with antibody, bacterial and animal viruses were basically different. Specifically, the difference resided in the stability of the union of virus and antibody. Whereas bacterial viruses formed stable complexes, animal viruses formed complexes that tended to dissociate readily.",

In 1956 Dulbecco et al. described the interaction of two animal viruses with their respective antibodies. The results of these studies led these investigators to conclude, among other things, that animal viruses, at least the two they studied, reacted with antibodies to form complexes that did not dissociate spontaneously. This interpretation was challenged by Fazekas de St. Groth and Reid (1958) . As more animal virus-antibody systems were studied by many investigators, there seemed to be greater accord for irreversible, rather than reversible, interaction. For this reason, in this article it is assumed that there are no differences between bacterial viruses, as one category, and animal viruses, as a separate category, concerning their interaction with antibody. Rather, differences, when they exist, are considered to be related to the viruses per se. Although this article is intended to survey the neutralization of animal viruses, occasional reference is made to studies on bacterial viruses when these studies are pertinent and illuminating to the topic at hand.",

In 197.1, Notkins and, in 1972 , Majer reviewed the topic of viral sensitization by antibody, i.e., the formation of a virus-antibody complex that continues to be infectious but has acquired sensitivity to such reagents as complement, or antibody specific for the antibody that is bound to the virus. More recently, the same topic was surveyed by who also reviewed the subject of immunopathology as it relates to virus-induced immunocomplexes. Other aspects of the general subject of viral immunology have been reviewed by Cowan (1973) who described the characteristics of the immune response to viral antigens, and by Burns and Allison (1975) who discussed the immune response, the mechanism of neutralization, and the nature of cell-mediated immunity. Methods for studying virus-antibody complexes have been reviewed by Mandel (1971a) .

Thermodynamic studies have indicated that the forward reaction is accompanied by an increase in entropy and a change in mean free energy of the order of -10 kcal/mole. The reaction therefore is \"downhill,\" i.e., is entropy-driven. Studies on the effect of temperature on the reaction rate have indicated that the system is not subject to activation and that the rate changes observed are related simply to changes in collision frequency induced by changes in thermal diffusion, Reaction rates of the order of 10' mole-' sec-' have been reported for several systems, indicating a very rapid process. Hornick and Karush (1969) have suggested that the rate-limiting variable is collision efficiency rather than collision frequency. A successful collision requires that both reactive sites be in apposition a t the time of approach. It has been indicated that, when the functional binding affinity of virus-antibody interaction is examined, the effect of valence is extremely important (Karush, 1976) . In studies with bacteriophage 4x174 there was an increase of more than lo' for bivalent compared with monovalent binding. Blank et al. (1972 I similarly stressed this aspect. In view of the fact that most virus-antibody interactions involve bivalent antibody and multivalent viral particles, it is likely that the majority of virus-antibody complexes are characterized by monogamous bivalent unions, hence by a very high binding affinity.",

(2) The class of antibody produced may depend on the mass of immunogen. It has been shown (Svehag and Mandel, 1964a ) that, with a relatively low amount of poliovirus, only the 19s class of antibody is induced in rabbits. With highcr amounts both 19 and 75 antibodies arc elicited. (3) It has been shown in many instances that the quality, i.e., the effectiveness, of antibodies improves with increasing time during the immune response.

            "text": "It was reported in the earlier literature (e.g., Burnet et al., 1937) that the outcome of a neutralization reaction was not absolute. It may register as a positive or negative result depending on the host cell or animal used as indicator. The importance of this source of variation was reemphasized more recently by the results described by Kjellh and Schlesinger (1959) , and subsequently by other investigators. This may be an important consideration, since the nature of the neutralization phenomenon may be an alteration in the viral capsid of lesser or greater subtlety. This alteration may, for one cell, represent a qualitatively unrecognizable particle but, for another, an altered particle albeit one that the cell still recognizes and can cope with, perhaps inefficiently. Andrewes and Elford (1933b) , for example, discussed the basis for abnormally small plaques in terms of \"incompletely neutralized\" virus. It has also been shown that the rate of appearance is delayed when survivors of animal virus neutralization are assayed (Mandel, .1958; Westaway, 1965a; Yoshino and Taniguchi, 1965b ). An unusual host variation was described by Hawkes (1964) . Antiserum to some, but not all, togaviruses enhanced infectivity providing (1) antiserum was obtained from fowl, not rabbits or mice, and (2) the host was chick cells, not pig kidney cells. Enhancement resulted from interaction with low concentrations of serum, but neutralization was observed with higher concentrations. Subsequent studies (Hawkes and Lafferty, 1967) suggested that enhancement was the result of a modification of the protein capsid that rendered the virus more efficient in its interaction with chick cells.",

With respect to stability, the genotype of viruses is usually very stable, and one can be assured that a given virus will display the same antigenic characteristics a t all times, irrespective of the host in which i t replicates. For enveloped viruses, the situation is complicated by the fact that the antigens are derived from two sources: (1) stable virus-coded proteins and (2) the host-coded lipoproteins that comprise the envelope. It has been thoroughly established that the viral envelope is acquired from the host cell during maturation (e.g., Haukenes, 1977) . Although the envelope contains viral proteins, it also retains the antigenic characteristics of the host. Consequently, these viruses induce and react with two groups of antibodies with different specificities.",

To illustrate, Madeley et al. ( 1971) showed that the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens of influenza virus induced specific antibodies. The antihemagglutinin antibody neutralized infectivity, while the antineuraminidase antibody had no such effect. They reported that these antibodies did not interfere with each other, suggesting that the antigenic structures were so arranged that there was no steric interference. Majer and Link (1971 1 similarly observed specific antibody responses. In addition, they showed that the nonneutralizing interaction with neuraminidase antibody could lead to neutralization by the addition of antiglobulin serum. A reasonable explanation, in the opinion of these workers, was that steric interference with the hemagglutinin antigen followed the secondary antibody reaction.",

For some strains the hexon antibody has neutralizing consequences. It has, however, been shown that this interaction is rather complicated (KjellBn and Pereira, 1968) . The hexon consists of two antigens, one of which is subsurface. The interaction of antibody with the surface antigen results in a rearrangement of the hexon structure that exposes the second antigen. Neutralization is a consequence of the reaction of this antigen with antibody. Recently, Symington et al. (1977) studied the effect of antisera prepared specifically against the two (El, E2) surface glycoproteins of Sindbis virus. Each antiserum alone had poor neutralizing activity. Antiserum versus the intact virion, however, was more active than the two specific sera, separately or in conjunction. Brown and Smale (1970) described a complex interaction between FMD virus (a picornavirus) and viral antiserum that suggests three distinct antigenic binding sites. Two are associated with the vertex regions, and the third with the planar surfaces. There is some specificity with respect to the interactions of IgG and IgM with their respective combining sites. Since all studies were based on agar precipitin reactions and electron microscopy, the significance of these interactions cannot be assessed with respect to neutralization. Subsequent studies (Rowlands et al., 1971 ) revealed that the antigens located at the vertexes were involved in stimulating the production of neutralizing antibody. Recently, Cavan-agh et al. (1977) reported that the VP, capsid polypeptide of FMD virus induced neutralizing antibody. Studies on another picornavirus, poliovirus, showed that antigenic specificity was related to a structural requirement. Subviral 14s particles had the same specificity as the parent particle, however, the 55 substructure of the 14s particle was antigenically distinct.",

Shortly after formation, the complex with 3.5s antibody was the least stable, and with 75 antibody the most stable. Given sufficient time, all complexes approached a uniform state of stability. Inasmuch as 7 and 55 antibodies are both bivalent, Keller considered the likelihood that the Fc fragment contributed to the stability of the virusantibody complex. In light of this report, a subsequent article by Keller (1968) is puzzling. Poliovirus was neutralized with 7 s antibody. Exposure of the virus-antibody complex to pepsin converted the 75 molecule to the 5s form without a change in the neutralized status of the virus. Further treatment with reducing agent converted the bivalent 5s molecule to the monovalent 3.5s form with restoration of infectivity. That the antibody fragment was still associated with virus was shown by the sensitivity of the complex to antibody specific for the attached 3.5s fragment.

In studies with influenza virus, Lafferty (1963b) reported that the Fab fragment neutralized infectivity and inhibited hemagglutination. However, in contrast to 75 antibody, the virus-monovalent antibody complex did not acquire stability. Lafferty attributed this deficiency in the antibody to its monovalency. Neutralization of herpesvirus by Fab fragments was reported by Ashe et al. (1969) . It was also shown that the Fab fragment of anti-antibody neutralized herpesvirus that had been sensitized by viral 7 s or Fab antibody. Shinkai and Yoshino (197513) examined the reactivity of antibody fragments toward herpesvirus. At 2 weeks after initiation of the immune response, F (ab') neutralized poorly, but a t 4 weeks its neutralizing capability equaled that of IgG. At 4 weeks the monovalent Fab' fragment failed to neutralize, per se, as well as in the presence of anti-antibody. Evidence that the fragment had combined with virus was provided by blocking experiments. After 9 weeks into the immune response, Fab' displayed a moderate neutralizing capacity which could be enhanced by anti-antibody.",

(1967) used fragments to evaluate the role of antibody valence in the neutralization of an RNA bacteriophage, R17. A comparison of the neutralization rate constants for bivalent 7 and 5 s molecules with those for monovalent 7, 5, and 3s molecules revealed a 30-fold higher rate for the bivalent molecules. The 7 and 55 monovalent antibodies were hybrid molecules containing one reactive site. These results stress the contribution of valence while minimizing a role for the Fc portion of the antibody molecule. These investigators attributed, speculatively, the lower reaction rate for the monovalent antibodies to a lower binding afkity and a concomitant higher dissociation rate compared with those of bivalent antibody. Rowlands (1967) questioned the role of antibody size and its steric effect on neutralization efficiency. Neutralization rate constants (molecule-l ml min-l) of 7, 5, and 3.5s antibodies were determined using bacteriophage f2 (closely related to R17). For 7, 5, and 3.55 molecules the rate constants were 2.12 x 10-12, 0.44 X 10-l2, and 0.16 X lo-\", respectively. Since there was a considerable disproportionality between rate constant and molecular size, he concluded that size was a relatively minor determinant in efficiency of neutralization. I n studies on the neutralization of two coliphages, T1 and T6, Goodman and Donch (1964) observed that the efficiency decreased as size and valence were reduced in going from a 7s to a 55 to a 3.55 molecule. I n a later study Goodman and Donch (1965) analyzed the role of molecular size in neutralization.",

Neither L, H, nor Fd fragment neutralized bacteriophage T1. However, binding to virus occurred, since neutralization resulted when antibody specific for the respective fragments was added to the virus-fragment complex. These workers proposed that lack of neutralizing activity was related to an insufficiently large fragment size. Stemke and Lennox (1967) compared the neutralization rates of two coliphages, T 2 and T5, by bivalent and monovalent antibody. The bivalent 7s antibody rate was about 40-fold greater than that of the Fsb I fragment, and about 10-fold greater than that of the Fab I1 fragment. They reported the interesting observation that, whereas the interaction of phage T 2 was single-hit with the 75 antibody, it was multihit (about 2.5 average hits) with the Fab fragments. However, all reactions with phage T5 were of the single-hit form. When the reactions were enhanced by the addition of antibody directed against the viral antibody, it was observed that the degree of enhancement was inversely related to the neutralization efficiency. Stemke and Lennox proposed that several parameters such as size, valence, and binding affinity, separately or in conjunction, contributed to the activity of antibody. They also questioned the significance of the use of anti-antibody. Perhaps, they suggested, neutralization that required the secondary effect of anti-antibody was not a bona fide interaction with respect either to the antibody per se or to the viral site to which it binds. Stemke (1969) further corroborated the greater importance of valence over size of the antibody molecule.",

A closer examination indicates that the underlying interactions have important differences. That there is an awareness of this consideration is reflected in the use of the plural form when Daniels (1975) and Burns and Allison (1975) refer to \"mechanisms\" of neutralization in their discussions.

            "text": "One of the conclusions Burnet et nl. (1937) arrived a t in their studies of several bacterial and animal viruses was that the two groups differed fundamentally in their interaction with antibody. Whereas bacterial viruses formed irreversible complexes with neutralizing antibody, animal viruses (those examined by Burnet et al.) formed freely reversible complexes (Burnet, 1960) . The assay inethods employed were at least formally comparable, namely, the plaque method for bacteriophages and the then newly developed pock-counting method utilizing the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated chick eggs for animal viruses. Subsequent studies (Dulbecco et aZ., 1956) of two animal viruses, poliovirus and WEE virus, employing the plaque assay method with animal cell cultures, indicated that the reaction of these viruses with antibody was irreversible. Reversibility, in the present context, represents a dynamic equilibrium between reactants and product with the final equilibrium depending upon association and dissociation rates, which in turn are concentration-dependent. The demonstration of reversibility requires that the sole variation in the reaction conditions be a change in the concentration of the reaction components, usually by dilution. Such a change should then drive the reaction toward dissociation until reestablishment of the equilibrium characteristic for the particular system. This aspect of viral neutralization has been under examination from the time that neutralization was first subjected to experimental scrutiny. Interpretation of early studies indicated that reversibility was characteristic of the neutralization of fowl plague virus (Todd, 1928) , vaccinia virus (Andrewes, 1928; Olitsky, 1930\\, EEE virus (Pierce et al., 1941) , papilloma virus (Bryan and Beard, 1941)' influenza virus (Taylor, 1941; Burnet, 1936 Burnet, , 1943 , and poliovirus (Gebhardt and Bullock, 1931) . However, the reaction was considered irreversible for papilloma virus (Friedewald and Kidd, 1940) and EEE virus (Labzoffsky, 1946) , and partially reversible for influenza virus (Taylor, 1941 ; Burnet, 1943 ).",

This aspect of viral neutralization was examined by Gard (1955) using a particularly appropriate system, namely, a strain of Theiler's virus (FA strain of mouse poliomyelitis) which could be assayed in mice with or without dilution based on the incubation period. He observed that, whereas the undiluted virus-serum mixture indicated neutralization, the diluted mixture did not. However, after 24 hours a t 37\u00b0C or 10 days a t 4\"C, dilution of the reaction mixture showed the expected decrease for a nondissociating complex. Gard proposed that the interaction between virus and antibody entailed two stages-a rapid but weakly cohesive union followed by enhancement of the forces binding virus and antibody. It may be relevant that the source of antibody in this study was serum from normal mice. It was shown by Olitsky (1940) that normal mice almost universally carry the TO strain of Theiler's virus. Antibody in the sera of these mice is TO-specific. The extent of cross-reactivity between the two strains may be a contributing factor to this phenomenon which Gard called \"immunoinactivation.\" However, in subsequent studies with human poliovirus and homologous antibody, Gard (1957) observed the same immunoinactivation characteristics.",

(1956) concluded that the reactions were irreversible were reinterpreted by Fazekas de St. Groth and Reid (1958) to show that the results were consistent with a reaction which is freely reversible and subject to mass-action phenomena. Reaffirmation of the view that a freely reversible equilibrium characterizes virus-antibody interaction resulted from studies on neutralization of influenza virus (Fazekas de St. Groth and Webster, 1963) . The complexity of the neutralization phenomenon has been stressed by Burnet (1960, p. 298) , Dulbecco et al. (19561, Fazekas de St. Groth and Reid (1958) , and Fazekas de St. Groth (1962) . It, is clear that neutralization consists of three domains-virus, antibody , and assay h o s t a n d each domain can be divided into subdomains of varying characteristics. To illustrate, Svehag (1965) compared the dissociability of poliovirus-rabbit antibody complexes when antibody was either early 19 or late 75. In neither case was dissociation evident with simple dilution. When dilution was carried out in conjunction with increasing ionic strength, minor but significant dissociation occurred when virus was complexed to 19s antibody. With 75 antibody no dissociation occurred when salt molarity was increased from 0.14 M to 5.0 M . The bond strength of the complex is a function of antibody type. The results of Svehag (1965) indicate that with late antibody the affinity constant is exceedingly high.",

Shortly after initiation of the reaction, the virus-antibody complex was completely reversible by dilution. Given sufficient time, however, the complex became irreversible. When monovalent antibody fragments were used, virus-antibody complexes were formed but failed to become irreversible. Lafferty (1963a,b) proposed that the transition to irreversibility represented the time required for the second combining valence of a bound antibody molecule to bind to an adjacent antigenic site on the same virion. That such monogamous bivalent binding occurred was demonstrated by electron microscopy (Lafferty and Oertelis, 1963) . Reversibility therefore requires the simultaneous dissociation of both antibody-virus bonds. The probability of such an event is proportional to the square of the probability of the single event. Lafferty (1963a) also suggested that close scrutiny of the methodologies employed in studies of neutralization could reconcile the two views, i.e., that a t least some features of a freely reversible system are characteristic of virusantibody interaction.",

(1937) for several aniinal viruses. With respect to the phages they had examined, Andrewes and Elford proposed that failure to be neutralized was not attributable to genotypic resistance, nor to the tendency for virus-antibody complexes to dissociate. A reasonable explanation for this phenomenon, in the view of Andrewes and Elford, was that combination with antibody had occurred hut without sufficient effect to negate infectivity. This view was supported by observations that (1) abnormally small plaques were produced, and (2) infectious particles were nonfilterable in contrast to the control virus. These surviving particles were designated \"incompletely neutralized.\" As Andrewes and Elford interpreted this phenomenon, a small number of antibody molecules had combined with antigenic determinants of the virus which were distinct from the host combining determinants. The presence of antibody constituted a steric encumbrance, thereby retarding the initiation of replication, hence small plaques were produced.",

Wallis and Melnick (1967, 1970) considered that no unusual interaction between virus and antibody occurred. However, the formation of aggregates, either before or during interaction with antibody, resulted in the shielding of some particles from antibody. A somewhat similar view was proposed by Rappaport (1970) differing, however, in one respect, namely, that for a single virion, binding of antibodies may occur to most antigenic determinants, leaving others free and inaccessible, hence the particle retains infectivity. Bradish et al. (1962) proposed an \"amphoteric\" state for some virus-antibody complexes such that either viral or antibody function dominated, depending on various contributory factors, e.g., the type of host cell comprising the test system. A similar interpretation was proposed by Lafferty (1963a) for rabbit poxvirus.",

Extrapolation of this possibility to representatives of various groups of viruses revealed t,hat in every case filtrates consisting of singly dispersed particles could be completely neutralized, whereas unfiltered virus showed nonneutralized fractions (Wallis and Melnick, 1967) . Further analysis of this problem disclosed that, when monodispersed herpesvirus was exposed to minimal concentrations of antibody, the resultant virus-antibody aggregates became nonneutralizable. Attempts by other investigators to eliminate the nonneutralized fraction by the method of Wallis and Melnick met with varying results. A reduction, but not complete elimination, was reported for VEE virus (Hahon, 1970b) and rhinovirus (Fiala, 1969) . In other studies it was reported that filtration had no effect on the nonneutralized level or neutralization characteristics (Ashe et al., 1969; Hyllseth and Petterson, 1970; Majer and Link, 1970; Huggett et al., 1972; Lewenton-Kriss and Mandel, 1972) , although elimination of a short lag period (Majer and Link, 1970 ) and a slight increase in neutralization rate (Lewenton-Kriss and Mandel, 1972) were observed. Baughman et al. (1968) described a complex result with respiratory syncytial virus. Filtration considerably reduced the nonneutralized fraction when horse antiserum was used. However, when guinea pig serum was used, no difference was seen between filtered and unfiltered virus.",

A recent report (Symington et al., 1977) described in more detail a similar observation, namely, at high-and low-antibody multiplicity the nonneutralized fraction of Sindbis virus was small, but at intermediate multiplicities the fraction was large. These workers considered the situation to be complex in that the serum contained antibodies of different avidities in unequal concentrations, and that the different antibodies either neutralized or protected against neutralization. With varying concentrations of antiserum one or the other kind of antibody had a competitive advantage. In studies with poliovirus evidence was presented that implicated antibody heterogeneity. Ozaki (1968) , Svehag (1968) , and Lewenton-Kriss and Mandel (1972) showed that the level of nonneu-tralized virus was highest with the earliest collected antiserum and decreased the later this antiserum was collected during the immune response.

Westaway (1968) and Ozaki et aZ. (1974) reported similar observations for several togaviruses. It has been shown (Svehag, 1965) that the chronology of the immune response can be characterized by successive changes in the class of antibody produced, as well as qualitative changes within a class. Antibodies produced early are predominantly of the macroglobulin (19s) type with low binding affinity. These are succeeded by the 75 type which tends, with time, to increase in binding affinity. A similar relationship was shown to exist in the response of individuals actively infected with poliovirus (Brunner and Ward, 1959; Ogra et al., 1968) , arbovirus (Bellanti et al., 1965) , mumps virus Daugharty et al., 1973) , coxsackievirus (Schmidt et al., 1968) , or influenza virus (Brown and O'Leary, 1971 1. These observations tend to incriminate a specific type of antibody as the cause of the nonneutralized state. Hahon (1970b) prepared nonneutralized VEE virus with human antiviral antiserum. For mediatcd neutralization he prepared anti-human IgG, IgA, and IgM in goats. The anti-IgG and anti-IgA sera were effective, the latter somcwhat less. The anti-IgM had no secondary neutralizing activity. It was also shown that goat anti-human Fab and anti-Fc sera had secondary neutralizing activity, the latter quite weak. These results implicated IgG and IgA as nonneutralizing antibodies. The absence of anti-IgM activity indicated cithcr that this class of antibody was not involved, or that it was absent in the virus-specific antiserum. A similar result was described by Notkins et aZ. (1968) in their studies on LDH. Virus was sensitized with mouse immune serum. Goat anti-mouse globulin neutralized the sensitized virus. Rab-bit anti-mouse IgG, IgA, and IgF neutralized sensitized virus, but rabbit anti-mouse IgM was ineffective. In another aspect of these studies, it was shown that the monovalent Fab fragment of goat anti-mouse globulin partially neutralized and blocked the remainder against neutralization by the undigested anti-mouse globulin. Ozaki et al. (1974) obtained antisera to JEV early (5 days) and late (28 days). Neutralization showed nonneutralized fractions in each case, the level being higher with the early serum. Neutralizing antibody in the early and late sera were IgM and IgG, respectively. Goat anti-rabbit IgM serum neutralized 99% of the nonneutralized fraction when early serum was used, whereas anti-IgG was without effect. When virus was neutralized with late serum, anti-IgG reduced the nonneutralized fraction slightly, but the anti-IgM not a t all, The same specificity was seen when direct neutralization was carried out by fractionated antiviral IgM and IgG then challenged by the fractionated anti-antibodies.",

The experimental basis was the observation that the level of surviving virus diminished when the filtrate of a virus-serum mixture was incubated. These workers considered this evidence for reequilibration, since virus-antibody complexes, but not antibody or free virus, were retained on the filter. Failure to alter the nonneutralized fraction by altering the concentration of antibody was explained on the basis that equilibrium was established between antibody and the total number of critical reactive sites rather than the number of viral particles.

There is evidence that neutralization is the culmination of sequential events beginning with the union of virus and antibody. It has therefore been proposed (Lewenton-Kriss and Mandel, 1972 ) that, either because of a defect in antibody or because of improper binding of antibody to virus, the reaction does not go to completion.

In support of the latter, evidence. has been presented that clumping may be responsible. Evidence has also been presented that single particles are involved, since monovalent fragments of viral antibody as well as monovalent fragments of the anti-antibody participate in this phenomenon. Although the cluinping hypothesis provides a possible explanatipn for the protected status, no explanation is evident when monodispersed virus is in the nonneutralized state.

From the early studies of Andrewes and Elford (1933s) to recent studies (e.g. , Hale et al., 1969) the presumption has been that the non-neutralized fraction is the result of an unusual virusantibody reaction. As with animal viruses, the nonneutralized fraction is subject to neutralization by anti-antibody. Also, as with animal viruses, some reports indicate that IgM antibody is involved, whereas other reports state that IgG antibody is involved. However, there is unanimity in the observation that antibody synthesized early, rather than late, in the immune response is more responsible for the nonneutralized state. Since it has also been a common observation that early antibodies have a relatively weak binding capability, it is this characteristic that is most likely directly concerned with nonneutralization. Studies with antibody fragments (Stemke and Lennox, 1967) have shown that, although Fab I1 has a higher neutralizing capability than Fab I, both interact with virus to the same degree as shown by mediation with anti-antibody. The interaction of Fab I with antigen may be less likely to result in neutralization than the Fab I1 interaction. It is also worthy of note that aggregation cannot be the basis of this interaction, since these reactions involve monovalent fragments. At the present time there are no experimental data that can account for the refractory state of the nonneutralized fraction. Possibly the infectious virus-antibody complex is sterically hindered, or the antigenicity of the capsid has been modified.",

The presence of a thermolabile substance that participated in the neutralization of Rous sarcoma virus was shown to be present in the sera of geese, ducks, chickens, and rabbits that had been immunized with Rous virus. Neutralizing activity was lost as a consequence of heating (56\u00b0C for 15 minutes) but could be restored by the addition of guinea pig serum if fresh, but not if heated.

Neutralizing activity was affected neither by heat (56\u00b0C for 15 minutes) nor by addition of complement. These results do not necessarily challenge the credibility of previous observations since, in the light of more recent knowledge, the stage in the antibody response that is complement-dependent probably had been passed since, as Howitt stated, the animals had been hyperimmunized. The independence of neutralizing activity was also reported (Strong, 1936) for human sera capable of neutralizing a presumable herpes-like virus, virus W.

Sera from normal (i.e., not knowingly exposed or immunized to the viruses under study) humans, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice with neutralizing activity for influensa virus, mumps virus, and NDV lost activity upon heating (56\u00b0C for 30 minutes), storage (4\u00b0C for 2 weeks), depletion of Ca2+, or decomplementation. Sera devoid of activity as a result of heat or storage were reactivated by the addition of fresh serum from a child with no prior history of mumps or influenza infection. Although these investigators were cognizant of the similarities in characteristics of complement and the accessory substance, they considered the latter to be distinct from complement because of certain quantitative discrepancies. Whitman (1947) suspected the presence of a neutralizing accessory substance in serum from an individual convalescing from infection with WEE virus when neutralizing activity decreased disproportionately with serum dilution. Suspecting the presence of an accessory factor, he confirmed his suspicions by demonstrating its thermolabile character and the augmentation of neutralizing activity by the addition of guinea pig serum to heated (56\u00b0C for 30 minutes) immune serum. In spite of the similarities between complement and the accessory substance, Whitman conservatively eschewed a specific label for the active material. Somewhat earlier, Morgan (1945'1 had reported that discrepancies in the quantitative aspects of the neutralization of WEE virus by immune rabbit sera were related to the use of fresh or heated serum, and that the addition of complement to the latter tended to eliminate the discrepancies. Another togavirus (dengue) was reported (Sabin, 1950) to be neutralized by complement-dependent antibody present in the serum of a convalescent monkey.",

Sera from immunized monkeys, or from human cases of mumps infection either in the acute or convalescent stage, contained neutralizing activity that was nullified by heating or by decomplementation. The addition, in either case, of fresh sera obtained from children less than 3 years of age restored neutralizing activity. These workers attributed the restoration to complement. I n the studies cited thus far, the viruses under investigation were myxoviruses, togaviruses, or poxviruses, all of which are virions containing lipid-rich envelopes. That the presence of an envelope is not required for complement-dependent neutralization was shown by several studies involving envelope-free bacterial viruses. I n 1947, Hershey and Bronfenbrenner described the participation of complement in the neutralization of two coliphages. An enigmatic aspect of this brief report indicated that in some instances a virus-serum mixture that had reacted to completion showed partial reactivation upon subsequent addition of complement.",

(1949) fractionated a rabbit serum containing antibody to WEE virus as well as accessory factor. Removal of the complement system depleted the serum of neutralizing activity. By rcconstituting the serum the neutralizing activity was restored, and the details of the reconstitution procedure indicated that components 2, 3, and 4 of the complement system were essential, whereas component 1 was either not required, or required in trace concentrations. Studies on two other togaviruscs, Murray Valley encephalitis and WN encephalitis, were described by Westaway (1965a). Unlike WEE, Murray Valley encephalitis virus was neutralized only slightly more efficiently with added complement, whereas WN virus neutralization was perhaps slightly inhibited by the addition of guinea pig serum. Another instance of complement-independent neutralization of a togavirus, JEV, was reported by Hashimoto and Prince (1963). The addition of fresh guinea pig serum to either early (18-day) or late (34-day) immune rabbit sera affected neither the rate nor the degree of neutralization. An unusual observation in these studies was the spontaneous partial reactivation of neutralized virus relatively late in the kinetic analysis of the reaction. Ozaki and Tabeyi (1967) observed marked enhancement of neutralizing actvity of JEV by fresh guinea pig serum. The rate and extent of neutralization were both increased. This result is in contrast t o the results reported by Hashimoto and Prince (1963). Of possible relevance to the different results are the observations of Iwasaki and Ogurs (1968s) that JEV grown in porcine cells induced complement-dependent antibodies specific for viral antigens as well as antibodies specific for host lipoproteins comprising the viral envelope. However, virus grown in mouse brain was insensitive to complement-dependent antibody. Whereas Ozaki and Tabeyi (1967) used virus cultivated in porcine cells, Hashimoto and Prince (1963) used virus derived from infected suckling mouse brain.",

Although antibody from horses appeared to be inde-pendent by end point analysis, a complement effect was observed as an increase in the neutralization reaction rate. It has been a common observation that sera obtained from normal individuals contain neutralizing substances, probably immature antibody, against an array of viruses, A rule of thumb to distinguish normal antibody from other inhibitory substances is the greater thermolability of the latter and the inability to replace the latter with complement. McCarthy and Genner (1952) examined normal sera from guinea pigs, rabbits, and humans for neutralizing activity against variola virus, herpesvirus, and cowpox virus. Positive sera lost some, but not all, activity after being heated a t 58\"C, and activity was regained upon the addition of fresh serum. These investigators proposed that the positive sera contained two separate neutralizing factors acting independently. Perhaps they envisioned two classes of antibody, one requiring complement and the other independent of complement, Howitt (1950) surveyed the sera from various animal species for the presence of normal neutralizing activity against NDV. The species examined included some known to have high levels of complement, e.g., human, monkey, rabbit, and guinea pig, and species with little or no complement, e.g., ferret, hamster, and chicken. Sera from human, monkey, rabbit, and guinea pig neutralized NDV when tested fresh, but lacked activity after heating (56\u00b0C for 30 minutes). The absence of neutralhing activity in fresh sera from ferret, hamster, and chick, and the ability to negate activity by heating the sera from complement-rich species, suggested a role for complement in the neutralizing activity of normal sera. Studies on the nature of the bacteriophage-neutralizing substance in normal human sera led Muschel and Toussaint (1962 I to conclude that t,he substance was antibody which was qualitatively indistinguishable from antibody appearing early during the immune response. In both instances, neutralizing antibody was complement-dependent.",

Rawls et al. (1967) examined sera from an infant with rubella infection, from the mother of the infant 1 year after the infection, and from an adult more than 5 years after infection. I n each instance the addition of complement to the heated sera increased the degree of neutralizing activity. Decomplementation resulted in reduced activity. It was of interest to these investigators that, unlike herpesvirus, rubella virus induced complement-dependent antibody long after infection. Leerhoy (1968) observed that, whereas guinea pig and horse sera effectively enhanced the neutralizing activity of human serum for rubella virus, rabbit and calf sera were relatively poor. Since horse sera lack C2 (Leerhoy, 1968) , this component of complement does not participate in this system. However, Maess (19711 considered C2 the limiting factor in the complement-dependent neutralization of equine arteritis virus. This conclusion was based on the distribution of activity following dialysis of a guinea pig serum with complement-effected activity. Hyllseth and Petterson ( 1970) also reported complement-dependent neutralizing antibody for equine arteritis virus in the serum of immunized rabbits as well as in the postinfection serum of horses. Kinetic studies, using horse serum as the source of antibody, showed a very slow rate of neutralization. The addition of complement (i.e., fresh guinea pig serum) 0, 1.5, or 3 hours after the start of the homologous reaction resulted, in each instance, in rapid extensive neutralization. All reactions, homologous as well as complement-effected, were kinetically single-hit. Radwan and Burger (1973a,b) demonstrated that antibody from horses, guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters, and mice immunized with equine arteritis virus was complement-dependent. Such dependent antibody was found to be late-appearing IgG. Early IgG and IgM were nonneutralizing, either per se or with complement. Further studies (Radwan et al., 1973) showed that the addition of complement to virus complexed with dependent antibody eventually resulted in lysis of the viral membrane. However, through the use of trypsin it was shown that neutralization preceded viral lysis. In previous studies on the neutrahation of a coronavirus, avian infectious bronchitis (Berry and Almeida, 1968), it was shown that complement-dependent neutralization occurred in the absence of viral lysis if the antiserum was devoid of antibody to the lipoprotein envelope. In the presence of such antibody, lysis was observed by electron microscopy.",

            "text": "The complexity of virus-antibody-complement interaction is further compounded by the molecular heterogeneity of the different classes of antibody, their diverse reactions with viral antigens, and their differential capacity to activate the complement system. The first stage in complement activation is the binding of the C l q component to the Fc hinge region of the antibody molecule. IgM, being a pentamer of IgG, has a far greater potential for activating complement. Variation in capacity to activate complement exists among the subclasses of IgG, e.g., IgG2, but not IgG1, from the same rat is capable. A study of human myeloma proteins (Spiegelberg, 1974) revealed that IgGl and IgG3 are more active than IgG2, whereas IgG4 is incapable of activating complement. The complexity of this system is further ramified by the variable sensitivity of a given complement system to antibodies of different origins. For example, guinea pig complement reacts maximally with homologous antibody, half as well with rabbit antibody, feebly with dog antibody, and not at all with chicken antibody. Furthermore, the homologous reaction is not necessarily optimal, as shown by the threefold greater reactivity of rabbit complement with guinea pig antibody than with rabbit antibody (Gigli and Austen, 1971) . I n view of the complex nature of complement activation, failure to effect viral neutralization by complement may be due as much to an inappropriate system as to real insensitivity.",

            "text": "In several of the previously cited studies, it was shown that the ability to effect viral neutralization with complement was related to the antibody developmental stage in the immune response. Antibody that appeared early reacted with virus either without neutralizing or neutralizing poorly, but in either case the addition of complement enhanced the degree of neutralization. In contrast, late antibody was independent of complement. Studies on the chronology of appearance of the different classes of antibody (Uhr et nl., 1962; Uhr, 1964; Uhr and Finkelstein, 1967; Svehag and Mandel, 1962, 1964a,b; Graves et al., 1964; Brown et al., 1964; McKercher and Giordano, 1967; Ogra et al., 1968) have indicated that IgM (19s) antibody precedes IgG (75). However, Osler (1976) indicated that, by the use of appropriate methods, the response to a nonviral iinmunogen (human serum albumin) in rabbits and guinea pigs within the first week was predominantly IgG antibody. Although the IgG antibody exceeded by 50-fold the amount of IgM (on a molar basis), the IgG antibody was not detectable by the more conventional serological rcactions. It is likely therefore that the affinity of the very early IgG antibody is of a very low order of magnitude. Cowan (1973) has also qucstioned the interpretation of such data. I n some studies, detection of the early IgM was based on its sensitivity to 2-mercaptoethanol. It has, however, been recognized recently that early IgG has a similar sensitivity. In other studies recognition of the type of antibody was based on separation by density gradient centrifugation or by molecular sieving. Yoshino and Taniguchi (1964) reported that early antibody in rabbits elicited by immunization, or after corneal infection, with herpesvirus could neutralize only when complement was present. Antibody appearing later was complement-independent. Further studies (Yoshino and Taniguchi, 1965al showed that dependent and independent antibodies were of the IgG class, that both resisted thermal inactivation a t 56\"C, or 7OoC for 30 minutes, and resisted inactivation by reduction (2-mercapto-ethanol). It was also shown (Yoshino and Taniguchi, 1966 ) that antibodies induced in guinea pigs by immunization, and in humans following herpes infection, were initially dependent and later independent of complement for neutralizing activity. The additional observation was made that herpes antibody in normal individuals (i,e., not currently, or recently infected) is complement-independent. Hence the presence of complementdependent neutralizing antibody is of diagnostic significance.",

Sera collected 7, 15, and 28 days later contained complement-dependent, thennolabile 19s antibody on day 7, complement-dependent 75 antibody on day 15, and partially dependent 75 antibody on day 28. This investigator suggested that the transition indicated the gradual enhancement of binding strength of antibody with time after immunization. In related studies Hhjek (1966) and Hltjek and Mandel (1966) showed that, whereas normal or early immune antibody t o T2 was complement-dependent, normal or early immune antibody to bacteriophage 4x174 was independent. As a possible explanation for the difference in behavior of the two viruses, it was proposed that binding affinity of antibody to antigen was the determinant characteristic, and that affinity for the relatively simple, small, icosahedral 4x174 bacteriophage was sufficiently high not to require augmentation. These investigators stated that, when the source of normal serum was newborn pigs that had not been allowed to receive colostrum, the sera contained no neutralizing activity against either T2 or 4x174. Pernis et al. (1963) compared antibody to bacteriophage T 2 obtained from normal newborn, normal adult, and immunized adult rabbits. Neutralization with newborn serum required complement, unlike both adult sera. Irreversible (by addition of fresh serum) loss of activity by heating (56\u00b0C for 30 minutes) occurred with newborn and adult normal sera. Treatment with EDTA or zymosan eliminated activity from both normal sera. These workers attributed complement-dependent neutralization to thermolabile 19s antibody. The results of treatment implicate the early components (Cl, C4, and C2) of the classic pathway in complement-effected neutralization.",

In rabbits immunized with a strain specific for humans, Andersen (1971) observed the early appearance of complement-fixing antibody which was incapable of neutralizing even in the presence of complement. Although late sera contained neutralizing antibody, complement was required as late as 18 weeks after hyperimmunization. Pursuing these studies, Andersen (1972) described the failure to detect neutralizing antibody, either complement-dependent or independent, in early sera of infected human subjects, although complement-fixing antibodies were present. Antisera in rabbits were prepared with two human strains (AD169 and C87) and two simian strains (Davis and T27). With the human strains, late sera contained complement-independent antibody, but with the simian strains antibody was dependent on complement for neutralization. In another study Graham et d . (1971) prepared antisera in primates (baboons and monkeys) to two human strains (C87 and AD169) and two monkey strains (GR2598 and GR2757). The hyperiminune sera to the human viruses contained complement-dependent antibody (of 19 and 75 classes), whereas antibody to the monkey strains was independentthe reverse of the results obtained by Andersen (1972) . Graham et al. (1971) have also indicated that antibody from goats hyperimmunized with the human strains was complement-dependent, as with the primate antisera. These workers have stressed the need for inclusion of Freund's adjuvant to obtain reasonably high levels of circulating antibody. Whether the use of adjuvant had any effect on the quality or class of antibody was not discussed. Minamishima et al. (1971) characterized CMV antibodies obtained from subhuman primates in the wild. Complement-independent antibody was detected against a simian strain of CMV. When the sera were tested for neutralization of human CMV strains, one strain (C87) was neutralized only when complement was present, while a second strain (AD169) was not neutralized at all. Finally, Ablashi et al. (1969) described the successful immunization of rabbits with a simian strain (SA6). Success, in this case, was indicative of the production of 7 and 19s antibodies, both of which were complement-independent.",

In the light of more recent knowledge, these data implicate one or more of the early-acting components (Cl, C4, or C2) in neutralization, inasmuch as the alternative pathway was functional. The early suspected implication of the role of properdin in viral neutralization was discussed by Ginsberg and Wedgwood (1959) . Taniguchi and Yoshino (1965) examined the role of complement in the neutralization of herpesvirus by early rabbit antibody. The immune serum was deprived of neutralizing activity by heating (56OC for 30 minutes) , zymosan, and ammonium hydroxide treatments. Individual components of complement (i.e., C1, C2, C3, and C4), obtained by fractionation of guinea pig sera, were added singly and in combination to the deactivated rabbit serum. Only when all four components, in optimal concentrations, were added did the rabbit serum reacquire neutralizing activity. An earlier study of this phenomenon (Dozois et al., 1949) , in which rabbit antibody to WEE virus was examined, resulted in a somewhat different conclusion; whereas components C2, C3, and C4 were required, component C1 was either dispensable or required in trace amounts. A t least one difference in the methodologies employed in the two studies involved the source of the complement components, namely, guinea pig sera and rabbit sera, respectively. Yet another interpretation of this phenomenon was proposed by Daniels et al. (1969, 1970) . Virus was allowed to react with isolated IgM antibody from early rabbit antiserum. Virus-antibody complexes were isolated by centrifugation and shown to be infectious and neutralizable by complement. The addition of either activated C1 or C4 was without effect, but the addition of both resulted in neutralization. The C2 and C3 components manifested activity when C1 was present a t an optimal concentration and C4 a t a suboptimal concentration.",

            "text": "A dependence on the first four complement components for neutralization of NDV by early rabbit IgM antibody was described by Linscott and Levinson (1969) . Neutralization enhancement by fresh guinea pig serum was negated by such treatments as heat, divalent cation depletion, and cobra venom. Activity was restored when all of the first four components were added to the treated serum. A similar conclusion with an interesting ramification was reported by Oldstone et al. (1972, 1974) . Antibody to polyoma, a nonenveloped virus, was induced in rabbits with the aid of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Antibody of the IgG class was isolated from heated antisera. Dependence on complement was a function of the multiplicity of bound antibody: below 10 to 20 molecules per virion required complement, above did not. At a multiplicity of 2, virus was sensitized and therefore neutralizable by fresh serum. Neutralization was also effected by a C6-deficient serum but not by a CCdeficient serum. Neutralization was effected by C l q alone, or by C1, C2, C3, and C4 in combination, but not by combinations of C1 and C4, or C1, C4, and C3. The positive result with C l q is attributed to its ability to aggregate the virus-antibody complexes. As these investigators indicate, this effect is of academic interest only, since C l q is not normally found in the free state in serum but rather as the conglomerate Clq-Clr-Cls, i.e., C1. In the various studies on complement-effected neutralization, several mechanisms to account for this phenomenon have been proposed. (1) The accumulation of complement on a virion-antibody complex produces a shield that, for steric reasons, prevents viral function. (2) Complement components cross-link juxtaposed virion-antibody complexes, resulting in the formation of aggregates. (3) For enveloped viruses, interaction of a virion-antibody complex with the complete complenient system results in lytic lesions in the membrane. (4) Based on the hypothesis that neutralization is the terminal stage of a multistage phenomenon, complement supplements a reaction which in its absence fails to go to completion. ( 5 ) Complement stabilizes a virus-antibody complex which otherwise is readily dissociated by dilution. Daniels et al. (1969 Daniels et al. ( , 1970 observed that complement component C1 failed to effect neutralization of herpesvirus that had combined with dependent antibody. However, the subsequent addifion of C4 resulted in neutralization. These workers proposed therefore that thc additive accumulation of both components was sufficient to interfere sterically with viral infectivity. A similar interpretation was proposed by Linscott and Levinson (1969) for complement-effected neutralization of NDV. The latter workers stressed the exponential manner in which the successive components of complement accumulate, e.g., one molecule of bound C1 may initiate the binding of several thousand molecules of C3. Direct support for this proposal of the amassing of complement on virion-antibody complexes was provided by electron microscopy. Berry and Almeida (1968) Evidence to substantiate the aggregation hypothesis was based on filtration and sedimentation analyses. In studies on herpesvirus (Wallis and Melnick, 1971; Wallis, 1971) it was shown that filterable complexes of virus and dependent antibody became nonfilterable after reacting with complement. This was attributcd to the formation of relatively large aggregates. If, however, the virion-antibody complexcs were highly diluted a t the time of addition of complement, neutralization without loss of filterability resulted. Hence, under the latter conditions, complement exerted its effect through stcric hindrance. In speculating on the nature of complement-dependent antibody, Wallis and Melnick suggested it was, or functioned as, a monovalent molccule. Oldstone et al. (1972 Oldstone et al. ( , 1974 demonstrated the aggregation of polyoma virus-antibody complexes by the increase in sedimentation ratc. The addition of an average of two molecules of antibody per virion increased its sedimentation ratc from 240s to 260s. When the first four components of complement were added, the sedimentation rate increased to 4505, indicating aggregation through the cross-linking action of complement. In these studies virus was doubly labeled radioisotopically, thercby allowing individual tracking of capsid and genome. Although the sedimentation rate was increased and the infectivity was neutralized, the virion remained intact based on the cosedimentation of the capsid and genome radioactivity markers. It should be noted that polyoma is a simple nonenveloped virus. Notkins et al. (1971) examined the effect of complement on herpesvirus complexed with IgM complement-dependent antibody. Although the addition of complement (pooled guinea pig sera) reduced infectivity by 99% , these investigators observed \"little or no effect\" on the sedimentation rate. The reasons for the different results for presumably similar systems (i.e., herpes-antibody-complement) are not discernible. Yoshino and Taniguchi (1965b) demonstrated the stability of complexes of herpesvirus and complement-dependent antibody. Neither extensive dilution nor sonication promoted dissociation. It was also shown that complexes that had adsorbed to host cells continued to show sensitivity to complcment, hence cellular induced dissociation did not occur.",

Antibodies are distinguishable functionally, if not physicochemically, by their neutralizing or sensitizing effect. Neutralizing antibody per se is capable of initiating the sequential reactions that terminate in the neutralization of infectivity. In contrast, the reactions initiated by dependent antibody fail to go to completion. They proposed that, whereas the earliest stages of the neutralization pathway cannot be influenced by complement, the later stages require progressively decreasing amounts of complement. In their studies, Yoshino and Isono (1978) discerned differences in antibodies with respect to how far the antibody could drive the reaction; complement-independent antibody (e.g., late IgG) drove the reaction to completion, and the decreasing order of capability was: dependent late and early IgG, late IgM, and early IgM. The above proposal was based on a concept (Mandel, 1976) of neutralization in which one molecule of antibody initiates con formational transitions between neighboring capsid subunits. The net result is an overall capsid alteration. Evidence underlying this concept was obtained with a picornavirus. Yoshino and Isono (1978) recognized the risk in extending this concept to an enveloped virus such as herpesvirus. However, they considered the possibility that the reactive surface antigens were protrusions of an underlying protein continuum.",

There was no evidence that cofactor reacts directly with virus. The relationship of co-factor to antibody class was studied. Antibody appearing early in the immune response was more sensitive to cofactor than late antibody. Characterization of antibody class showed that 195 antibody, but not late 7s antibody, was sensitive. These investigators considered the interesting possibility that, the early immune response may consist of a 75 antibody that is cofactor-dependent. However, the procedures usually employed for separation of antibody types also segregate cofactor with the 19s antibody. Hence, although 7s antibody may be present, the demonstration of its presence requires cofactor from which it has been separated. Based on this conjecture, these investigators found that in some instances a very early response consisted of 19 and 7s antibodies, both requiring cofactor. Because of this dependence, these antibodies were considered \"imperfect\" in contrast to \"classic\" antibodies.",

Like rheumatoid factor, protein A hinds to the Fc region of IgG that is complexed to virus. I n some instances neutralization is effected, or in other instances requires the addition of anti-protein-A antibody. Failure of rheumatoid factor and protein A to effect neutralization has been attributed (Austin and to their MWs, about 900,000 and about 40,000, respectively. A lower-MW preparation of protein A, i.e., about 20,000 daltons is effective. It was therefore suggested that too few molecules of the higher-MW substances bind to the infectious virus-antibody complex. A survey of other physicocheinical parameters indicated to Austin and Daniels (19741 that net charge and shape were irrelevant. This interpretation is somewhat puzzling, since these workers consider sterie hindrance to be the basis for neutralization. It seems that, if fewer molecules of the higher-MW substance bind to the virus-antibody eoinplex. it is because the complex has been saturated and therefore is as completely sterically hindered as by the lower-MW compounds. Way and Garwes (1970) hsve reported that neutralization of Semliki Forest virus by guinea pig antiserum can be enhanced by the addition of serum from various animal species.

The generality of this phenomenon was extended when it was seen that herpesvirus could be neutralized by an antiglobulin serum (Ashe and Notkins, 1966) . After exposure of herpesvirus to a hyperimmune rabbit antiserum, a considerable proportion of virus survived. Goat anti-rabbit globulin neutralized more than 99.9%.

Goat anti-human globulin, specific for IgG or IgA, neutralized sensitized virus, while IgM was ineffective. It cannot be decided if the ineffectiveness was real or if it was due to the absence of IgM antihody in association with virus. Further studies (Hahon, 1970b) revealed that the Fab fragment of the antiglobulin had mediated neutralizing activity but was less effective than the intact IgG. Hahon (1970a) expressed the opinion that assaying for neutralization by the use of specific serum and antiglobuh when carried out by the quenching of fluorescence of infected cells was more sensitive than by the quenching of infectivity in mice. Majer and Link (1970) studied the kinetics of neutralization of vaccinia virus. Neutralization by human antiviral IgG showed a slight lag, followed by an exponential decline and leveling off. When sheep antihuman globulin was included in the reaction, the lag and leveling off were eliminated. Filtration of virus to exclude aggregates eliminated the lag but not the tendency for the reaction to level off. Radwan and Burger (1973b) presented data indicating that the Fab region of the bound antivirus antibody is the target site for mediated neutralization. They sensitized equine arteritis virus and then cleaved the bound antibody with trypsin. Virus complexed to the fragmented antibody was insensitive to neutralization by complement but retained its sensitivity to antiglobulin, hence this evidence indicated absence of the Fc region.",

A study of each antigen-antibody reaction (Majer and Link, 1971) showed that the hemagglutinin reaction was insensitive to antiglobulin. However, addition of antiglobulin to the neuraminidase reaction resulted in neutralization. It was theorized that the sites were, respectively, critical and noncritical for infectivity. Neutralization via the noncritical site mediated by antiglobulin could be explained on the basis of steric interference with the adjacent hemagglutinin. Or, less likely in the opinion of Majer and Link, the antiglobulin stabilized the neuraminidaseantibody reaction. Presumably, these workers considered that stabilization could have an effect on the neighboring hemagglutinin structures; the term \"stabilization\" was not defined.",

Hence the focus of interest on how antibody functions is restricted either to the direct effect of antibody on the integrity of the virion, or to the subversion of one of the early stages in the replication cycle. As indicated previously (Section I1,E) , neutralization can be the final manifestation of several phenomena that are fundamentally different. At the most elementary level, one can envision a morphologically simple virion (with several copies of a single antigen uniformly distributed throughout the capsid) at a very low concentration interacting with one or several molecules of a homogeneous antibody population, and as a result losing its infectious capability. At the other extreme, one can envision a morphologically complex virus, composed of several diff went antigens in a topographically complex distribution, some antigens being virus-specific and others host-specific, some reacting with one class of antibody and others with a different class (e.g., herpesvirus; see Miyamoto et al., 1971) . In addition, if the relative concentrations of virus and antibody are adjusted appropriately, secondary interactions leading to the formation of large aggregates may occur. Which of the concurrent reactions represents the critical neutralizing event cannot readily be isolated from those that may also lead to neutralization but for superficial reasons.",

It was found that neutralized virus had a decreased probability for elution-about 5% compared with 2545% for unneutralized virus. This observation, together with the enhanced adsorptive capacity, implies that when virus has reacted with antibody the virion has acquired a greater binding affinity for the receptor. With neutralized avian infectious bronchitis virus, there was no effect on elution (Stinski and Cunningham, 1970) , but with NDV (Silverstein and Marcus, 1964) and rabbit poxvirus (Joklik, 1964) elution was greater for neutralized virus.",

Since DNase did not affect the phage, infectivity could not be attributed to released DNA. However, an anti-DNA serum (lupus erythematosus) neutralized infectivity for protoplasts. These workers suggested that the capsid had undergone a rearrangement rendering the DNA accessible to interaction with the external environment. Kjellkn and Pereira (1968) have proposed that the hexon structure of adenovirus is composed of two antigens, one of which is internal.

It has' been shown (e.g., Carthew, 1976; Beneke et al., 1977) that the VP1 polypeptide is most highly labeled, and VP2 and VP3 are relatively inaccessible. VP4 appears to be entirely shielded, although in the free state it can bind the labeling compound. Carthew (1976) showed that, after reacting with antibody, the VP4 polypeptide became accessible, indicating that a rearrangement in the spatial organization of the capsid had occurred. In light of this observation, it is of interest to consider the results described by Breindl (1971) . After neutralisation of poliovirus, the virus-antibody complex was fractionated, yielding a fragment consisting of the atibody bound to the VP4 polypeptide, This result, together with the labeling rcsults, suggest the interesting possibility that antibody initially combines with the reactive site which may not include ' the VP4 polypeptide. Conformational rearrangements may ensue that allow the antibody to transfer its allegiance to a more compatible receptor, the VP4 polypeptide. A schematic proposal of how such a rearrangement might occur has been suggested by Lonberg-Holm and Yin (1973) . An in vitro system for uncoating poliovirus has been developed (De Mandel, 1976, 1977) . When neutralized poliovirus was examined in this system, it was seen to be resistant to uncoating. I n the previous studies on the intracellular fate of neutralized poliovirus (Mandel, 1967b), evidence for a low level of uncoating was seen in the form of degraded viral RNA. However, a similar result was seen with native virus but, unlike neutralized virus, undegraded RNA was also seen. The degraded RNA possibly reflects an aberrant, abortive uncoating process to which neutralized virus as well as native virus is susceptible.",

The law, however, had to be qualified: The concentration of antibody had to be in considerable excess over the concentration of virus. The law has been found to apply to virus-antibody interactions in general. The basis for this relationship can be understood in terms of collision frequency and relative concentrations of the reactants. The number of successful collisions is a function of the concentrations of virus and antibody. If the concentration of antibody is in great excess, the number of collisions per unit time will not decrease as a result of removal of antibody by binding to virus. Since the collisions are indiscriminate, the number involving unneutralized particles will diminish by the same proportion for each unit of time. The result is a reaction of the first order. If virus concentration is increased, the number of collisions will increase accordingly, but the fraction of virus particles undergoing neutralization will be the same as for the lower concentration. From these observations it follows that the rate of neutralization is a function of t,he concentration of free antibody, and the rate will be constant, providing the decrease in free antibody concentration during the course of the reaction is extremely small relative to the total concentration.",

In the case in which n = 1 the equation reduces to A semilogarithmic plot of a reaction that fits Eq. (4) shows a linear course from time zero, indicating that one successful encounter inactivates that particle. Where more than one successful encounter is required, a period of time has to elapse to allow for the total necessary encounters before the first particle will be inactivated. The period of time is indicative of the number of hits required, which is the value of n in Eq. ( 3 ) . When portrayed graphically, this period is seen as a lag or shoulder on the curve preceding the linear course of inactivation. A single-hit mechanism does not rule out the possibility that more than one molecule combines with a particle prior to inactivation. It does rule out the participation of these molecules in the inactivating event. Otherwise their participation would be manifested by a lag in the time course of inactivation. The data of Rappaport (1970) , which showed four or five molecules of antibody per inactivated virion, indicated that all but one molecule were not involved in causing neutralization. Other studies (Yoshino and Taniguchi, 1965b; Ashe and Notkins, 1967; Krummel and Uhr, 1969; Dudley et al., 1970; Hahon, 1970b; Lewenton-Kriss and Mandel, 1972) showed that several molecules of antibody reacted with one virion (animal or bacterial) prior to inactivation. Their presence was detected by the use of antiglobulin to mediate neutralization. I n several of these studies the mediated inactivation showed a more rapid rate but, nonetheless, also characteristically a single-hit mechanism. For example, in the studies of Dudley et al. (1970) and Krummel and Uhr (1969) , the reaction rate of the mediated reaction was three-to fourfold more rapid than the direct reaction, suggesting that the earliest binding molecules were noneffective but could be made effective by the antiglobulin.",

There can be no argument that on the average several molecules of antibody may combine with a virion when it is neutralized. Whether all, or only one, have a function in neutralization is at present undetermined. Possibly all but one may be functionally deficient, or they may have reacted with sites that do not respond appropriately. A relevant observation has been made in several studies; neutralization of infectious virus-antibody complexes by antiglobulin also shows a single-hit mechanism, and at a rate that exceeds the rate of the homotypic reaction. If a virus requires n hits to be neutralized but has received nz hits, it should not be neutralizable by antiglobulin. It is also pertinent that monovalent fragments of the antiglobulin can mediate neutralization.

In this hypothesis the assumption is made that neutralization is the result of one effective collision. Justification for this assumption is based on the interpretation of kinetic data. An effective collision is dependent either on reaction with a critical site, or on reaction with any antigenic site but in a critical manner. Previous studies (Mandel, 19711) ) showed that the poliovirus capsid undergoes spontaneous oscillations between two conformational states characterized by distinct isoelectric points. Inactivation by antibody stabilized the capsid in one of the conformational states. Subsequent studies (Mandel, 1976) with highly diluted antiserum showed the redistribution of the viral population from the normal to the neutralized conformational state by an all-or-none mechanism. The two states differed by more than 2 pH units. Under no conditions were particles of intermediate isoelectric point seen. Moreover, the proportion of virus neutralized and the proportion of virus conformationally stabilized were equal. It was also shown that, in an in vitro system capable of carrying out the early stage of viral uncoating, neutralized virus was refractory.",

These expectations are based on the similarities of the structure of the viral capsid and the structure of proteins subject to allosteric transitions (see Monod et al., 1965 , for a discussion of allosterism) . Particles in this state are incapable of undergoing normal interactions with plasma membrane of susceptible cells.

Crucial to this hypothesis is an appreciation of the variability inherent in antibodies with respect to their class and to their binding affinity. According to their hypothesis the most efficient antibody is capable of initiating a series of physicochemical changes in a virion that culminates in neutralization. Less efficient antibody can induce some, but not all, of the changes. I n this case, complement (and presumably antiglobulin) can mediate the reaction. Very inefficient antibody-\"slow-reacting\" in their terminology -c a n bind to virus but cannot drive t,he reaction to the stage where complement can complete the reaction. In terms of how far the various antibodies can alter the virion toward the neutralized state, these workers classify the antibodies as slow-reacting, early IgM, late IgM, early and intermediate IgG (all incapable per se of neutralizing, and, finally, late IgG antibody that is independent of complement. They have also subdivided the essential changes in the virion leading to neutralization with respect to (1) dependence on time (the early stages) and (2) dependence on temperature (late stages). They propose that one molecule of antibody is sufficient to initiate all reactions whether they fail or succeed in neutralizing. The satisfying feature of this hypothesis is that it allows an interpretation of several distinct phenomena that characterize neutralization: (1) single-hit inactivation, (2) role of antibody diversity, (3) mediated neutralization and, possibly, (4) the nonneutralized state.",

Based on data for FMD virus, Trautman and Harris (1977) have determined that a t least two or three critical sites (the number varies according to the host assay system) that react with IgG are required, whereas only one that reacts with IgM is required for infectivity. The total number of either type of critical site is as yet not known.

Burnet's eloquent assessment of this situation (1960, p. 298) is as true today as then. However, the ability to cope with this difficulty has improved, at least technologically. Daniels (1975) has summarized the neutraliztion phenomenon as representing three pathwaye: (1) saturation of viral antigens, (21 aggregation by cross-linking of multivalent virions by bivalent antibodies, and (3) virolysis. Although the net result in each case is loss of or reduction in infectivity, the underlying mechanisms may be basically different.

Interaction of virus at a very low concentration with the minimum multiplicity of antibody is most likely to reveal why virus has been neutralized. Since under some circumstances neutralized virus can still adsorb to cells, or conversely, since adsorbed virus can still be neutralized, the implication is that the viral capsid has undergone an alteration that subverts subsequent interaction with cells. The nature of the alteration is most likely to be understood on the basis of protein-protein interactions. Some clues have already been described indicating that each reactant has undergone some change from its native state. Antibodies can interact with complement, or bind to cells, only after they have reacted with antigen. Feinstein and Rowe (1965) have proposed that antibody undergoes a conformational rearrangement upon binding t o antigen (for an extensive discussion of this proposal see Feinstein et al., 1971 ) . Several examples have been cited that indicate conformational or degradative changes in virion capsids following interaction with antibody. It is of interest that, whereas early antibody reacts with virus but requires mediation, late antibody can neutralize independently. It has also been shown that one difference between early and late antibody is the greater binding affinity of late antibody. The greater the binding affinity, the greater the stress, involvement, and disorganization in the capsid. Such disorganization may be reversible (e.g., by causing dissociqtion) but in such a state the capsid may not be acceptable t o a cell.",

It hardly needs to be stated that solution of these problems will represent the groundwork for considerations of problems at the next level-in vivo interactions.",
