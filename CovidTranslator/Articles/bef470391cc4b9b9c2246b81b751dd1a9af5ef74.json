After challenge exposure we observed mortality rates of 44% for litters of seven PRCV-infected sows, 40% for litters of four sows orally immunized with the attenuated TGEV strain Nouzilly, and 91% for litters of seven seronegative susceptible sows. A blocking ELISA with two appropriate monoclonal antibodies distinguished serological responses of PRCV-infected sows from those of TGEV-immunized sows. The results suggest that natural infection of the sow with PRCV may induce a degree of protective lactogenic immunity against TGE.",

            "text": "The gut epithelium of the newborn piglet is the main target of the transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) coronavirus (TGEV) which is therefore a specific enteropathogenic virus (Haelterman, 1972) . The tonsils and respiratory tract are considered as secondary targets (Kemeny et al., 1975; Kemeny and Woods, 1977; Furuuchi et al., 1979) and respiratory disorders caused by TGEV are unknown. Since 1984, TGEV seroconversion has been observed in the swine population of different European countries in the absence of any clinical disease. These countries include Belgium (Pensaert et al., 1986) , Denmark (P. Have, personal communication, 1987), France (Jestin et al., 1987) and England (Brown and Cartwright, 1986) . A porcine respiratory, non-enteric coronavirus related to TGEV was isolated in Belgium (Pensaert et al., 1986 ), in Denmark (P. Have, personal communication, 1987 , in England (Garwes et al., 1988) and in France (Duret et al., 1988) . This porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) induces a serological response that cannot be distinguished from that of TGEV-infected pigs by seroneutralization test in cell culture. PRCV and TGEV show a close antigenic relationship and can be distinguished from each other only by use of appropriate monoclonal antibodies (Garwes et al., 1988; Laude, 1988) . This shows that several epitopes located in the C and D domains of gpE2 of TGEV are absent on the gpE2 of PRCV (Laude, 1988) . Our objective was to evaluate the degree of passive protection against experimental TGE challenge exposure among 57 piglets nursing from seven seropositive sows from two herds which had been infected by PRCV > 1 year ago.",

Laude, INRA, 78350 Jouy-en-Josas, France (Delmas et al., 1986) ; it neutralizes TGEV and reacts by indirect immunofluorescence with TGEV antigens, but not with PRCV. MAb 44-4 is used as a representative reagent for enteric TGE viruses. MAb E4 strongly neutralizes both TGEV and PRCV, and is used as a representative of a common epitope located in the A domain (Delmas et al., 1986) of the peplomer glycoprotein E2. A blocking ELISA was developed in Lindholm using pelleted Purdue-115 virus as an antigen. Virus was adsorbed directly onto the plates followed by overnight incubation with dilutions of test sera in PBS-Tween 20. The tests were completed using successively a predetermined dilution of monoclonal antibody and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Titers were calculated by interpolation as the dilution giving 50% inhibition (E4) or 25% inhibition (44-4) compared with a negative reference. A 50% cut-off level was selected for the E4 test on the basis of a statistical analysis of results obtained by examining 748 TGEVseronegative samples. These samples showed, on average, 0% inhibition with a standard deviation of + 11% inhibition. Thus, the 50% cut-off level allows for a very specific test while maintaining a sensitivity that is, on average, four times higher than the neutralization test for serum samples (data not shown). The 25% cut-off level for the 44-4 test was chosen primarily to obtain a reasonable test sensitivity. On the basis of statistical analysis of 197 PRCV antibody-positive samples the 44-4 test showed, on average, 9% inhibition with a standard deviation of + 10%. With a cut-off level of 25%, this would correspond to a probability of getting a false-positive sample of P=0.05 (one-sided test).",

However, protection was not complete in that only two litters out of seven did not show morbidity after challenge exposure, and five out of seven sows had protected their litters. This level was comparable with that of sows vaccinated with the Nouzilly strain, and contrasts with the absence of protection by all the seronegative sows. The age of litters at challenge could be a relevant factor. Age-related resistance to TGEV is well documented and the choice of a highly virulent TGEV for challenge of litters is crucial. We rejected the Miller strain because of its moderate pathogenicity. The mortality rate observed with the Miller strain by Moxley (Moxley, 1983) and by us does not exceed 60-70% (data not shown). In contrast, with the Gep-II strain, most (91%) of the 2-to 17-day-old control piglets died. In this experiment, it is not possible to show any difference by ANOVA analysis between age average of the three groups (F2.,5 = 0.549, P = 0.62). In contrast, the difference in the average mortality is highly significant (F2.15 = 5.047, P = 0.02 ).",

Ten days after challenge, all TGEV-immunized sows showed an anamnestic neutralizing antibody response in serum and milk. An anamnestic antibody response specifically of E4 epitope was detectable in sera of all seven PRCV-infected sows. Hooyberghs et al. (1988) found conflicting evidence that sows naturally infected with PRCV may not adequately protect their litters against natural TGE challenge in the field. This discrepancy could be explained by the conditions used for evaluation of protective immunity. In our case, a standardized challenge with a highly virulent strain of TGEV was carried out under experimental conditions among sows of different but known immune status. During natural TGE outbreaks, the occurrence of other enteropathogens, known for their ability to enhance the pathogenicity of TGEV (E. coli, Rotavirus, Coccidia), cannot be excluded. It is interesting to observe that a decrease of clinical TGE in Europe has been concomitant with development of PRCV seroconversion in the swine population. This feature can be considered as an argument in favor of cross-protection between TGEV and PRCV.",
