However, great progress in measles control has been made in resourcepoor countries through accelerated measles-control efforts. The global elimination of measles has been debated since measles vaccines were first licensed in the 1960's, and this debate is likely to be renewed if polio virus is eradicated. This review discusses the pathogenesis of measles and the likelihood of the worldwide elimination of this disease.",

The disease is characterized by a prodromal illness of fever, cough, coryza and conjunctivitis followed by the appearance of a generalized maculopapular rash. Deaths from measles are mainly due to an increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial and viral infections, which is attributed to a prolonged state of MV-induced immune suppression (BOX 2) .",

The virus was introduced into the Americas in the sixteenth century as a result of European exploration of the New World, resulting in thousands of deaths in native Amerindian populations. Deaths in this susceptible native American population due to measles and smallpox facilitated the European conquest of the Americas 2 .

Remarkable progress in reducing measles incidence and mortality has been made in resourcepoor countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa 20 , as a consequence of increasing measles vaccine coverage, provision of a second opportunity for measles vaccination through supplementary immunization activities, and efforts by the WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and their partners to target 45 countries for accelerated and sustained measles mortality reduction 21 . Provision of vitamin A through polio and measles vaccination campaigns has contributed further to the reduction in measles mortality 1 ",

The Dahlem Conference on Disease Eradication (1997) defined eradication as the permanent reduction to zero of the global incidence of infection caused by a specific pathogen as a result of deliberate efforts, with the consequence that interventions would no longer be necessary. Although modifications to this definition were subsequently proposed, three criteria were deemed necessary for a disease to be considered eradicable: first, humans must be crucial for transmission; second, sensitive and specific diagnostic tools must exist; and finally, an effective intervention must be available. Demonstration of the interruption of transmission in a large geographic area for a prolonged period further supports the feasibility of eradication. Measles is thought by many experts to meet these criteria for eradication 24, 25 .",

Post-measles encephalomyelitis, an autoimmune disorder triggered by MV infection, occurs in approximately 1 in 1000 cases, and is mainly confined to older children and adults. Encephalomyelitis occurs within two weeks of the onset of rash and is characterized by fever, seizures and various neurological abnormalities. Other CNS complications that occur months to years after acute infection are measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). MIBE and SSPE are caused by persistent MV infection. MIBE is a rare but fatal complication that affects individuals with defective cellular immunity and typically occurs months after infection. SSPE is a slow progressive disease characterized by seizures, progressive deterioration of cognitive and motor functions and by death, which occurs 5-15 years after MV infection, most often in persons infected with MV before 2, which years of age. Infectiousness. MV is one of the most highly contagious infectious agents and outbreaks can occur in populations in which less than 10% of individuals are susceptible. The contagiousness of MV is best expressed by the basic reproductive number (R o ), which is the mean number of secondary cases that would arise if an infectious agent were introduced into a completely susceptible population. R o is a function not only of the infectious agent but also of the host population. The estimated R o for MV is generally assumed to be 12-18, in contrast to only 5-7 for smallpox virus and 2-3 for SARS coronavirus. In the 1951 measles epidemic in Greenland, the index case attended a community dance during the infectious period resulting in an R o of 200 (REF. 37 ). The high infectivity of MV implies that a high level of population immunity (approximately 95%) is required to interrupt MV transmission. Further hindering elimination efforts is the fact that persons with measles are infectious during the prodromal phase, several days prior to the onset of rash, and therefore transmit the virus prior to clinical case detection. MV can be isolated in tissue culture from urine as late as one week after the onset of rash. Detection of MV in body fluids by various means, including identification of multinucleated giant cells in nasal secretions and the use of PCR after reverse transcription of RNA (RT-PCR), indicates the potential for prolonged infectious periods in persons immunocompromised by severe malnutrition or HIV-1 infection 38, 39 . However, whether detection of MV by these methods indicates prolonged contagiousness is unclear, and prolonged transmission of MV is not likely to be a significant obstacle to eradication. In contrast to polioviruses 40 , transmission of the live attenuated measles vaccine virus has not been reported.",

HIV-1-infected mothers have defective transfer of IgG antibodies across the placenta, resulting in lower titres of protective antibodies in the infant, which increases the period of susceptibility to MV infection prior to routine immunization. HIV-1-infected children that are vaccinated against MV might become susceptible to MV owing to progressive HIV-1-induced immunosuppression. Children with defective cell-mediated immunity might not develop the characteristic measles rash, and infection might therefore go unrecognized, with the potential for widespread transmission of MV, particularly in healthcare settings. Finally, HIV-1-infected children might have impaired cell-mediated immune clearance and prolonged shedding of MV 39 , increasing the period of infectivity and the spread of MV to secondary contacts. However, even if HIV-1-infected children lose protective immunity over time, the high mortality rate of HIV-infected children, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where approximately one third of untreated HIV-1-infected children die by one year of age and half are dead by two years of age, is such that they do not live long enough for a sizeable pool of MV-susceptible children to accumulate 42 .

The American Red Cross, along with other partners, has played a significant role in establishing the Measles Initiative, which has been responsible for much of the success in measles control in Africa and is committed to reducing global measles deaths by providing measles vaccine to children. The key questions regarding global measles elimination are whether epidemiological conditions are sufficiently different in parts of Africa and Asia to hinder measles-elimination efforts, and whether there will be the political and public support necessary for elimination activities. Interruption of MV transmission could be difficult in densely populated urban environments of Africa and Asia and in regions of high HIV-1 prevalence 24 . Other potential obstacles to global measles elimination have been identified, including immunity that decreases over time, and the possibility of transmission from subclinical cases, although these have not hindered measles elimination in the Americas 24,75 . Measles outbreaks have occurred in susceptible adults, most notably the large outbreak in S\u00e2o Paulo, Brazil, in 1997, but have not led to sustained endemic transmission 24 . Garnering the political will and public support is likely to be more difficult in resource-rich countries where the burden of disease due to measles is not recognized and unfounded fears of serious adverse events from vaccination are more prevalent. Whether the threat from bioterrorism precludes stopping measles vaccination after eradication is a topic of debate, but, at the least, a single-dose rather than a two-dose measles vaccination strategy could be adopted 73 .",

The characteristic clinical features of measles are of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to have a high predictive value in regions where measles is endemic. However, laboratory diagnosis is necessary if MV transmission rates are low or in immunocompromised persons who might not have the characteristic clinical manifestations(BOX 2). Infection with rubella virus, parvovirus B19, human herpes virus 6 and dengue viruses all cause symptoms that can mimic those of measles. Detection of IgM antibodies to MV by enzyme immunoassay is the standard laboratory method for diagnosing acute measles",
