The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses Filoviridae Study Group and other experts have recently established an almost consistent classification and nomenclature for filoviruses. Here, further guidelines are suggested to include their natural genetic variants. First, this term is defined. Second, a template for full-length virus names (such as ''Ebola virus H.sapiens-tc/COD/1995/Kikwit-9510621'') is proposed. These names contain information on the identity of the virus (e.g., Ebola virus), isolation host (e.g., members of the species Homo sapiens), sampling location (e.g., Democratic Republic of the Congo (COD)), sampling year, genetic variant (e.g., Kikwit), and isolate (e.g., 9510621). Suffixes are proposed for individual names that clarify whether a given genetic variant has been characterized based on passage zero material (-wt), has been passaged in tissue/cell culture (-tc), is known from consensus sequence fragments only (-frag), or does (most likely) not exist anymore (-hist). We suggest that these comprehensive names are to be used specifically in the methods section of publications. Suitable abbreviations, also proposed here, could then be used throughout the text, while the full names could be used again in phylograms, tables, or figures if the contained information aids the interpretation of presented data. The proposed system is very similar to the well-known influenzavirus nomenclature and the nomenclature recently proposed for rotaviruses. If applied consistently, it would considerably simplify retrieval of sequence data from electronic databases and be a first important step toward a viral genome annotation standard as sought by the National Center for",

            "text": "The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV, http://www.ictvonline.org), the body tasked by the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS) to make decisions on matters of virus classification and nomenclature, is responsible for the assignment of viruses to taxa (orders, families, subfamilies, genera, and species). This task is supported by the intellectual input from specialized groups, the ICTV Study Groups. Study Groups serve as advisory committees and connect the ICTV taxonomists with laboratory virologists, who investigate viruses scientifically. ICTV Study Groups and other expert groups, but not the ICTV itself, propose unique virus names and abbreviations. Fauquet et al. discussed in 2008 that ''[i]t is de facto accepted by the virologists that there is no homogeneity in the demarcation criteria, nomenclature and classification below the species level, and each specialty group is establishing an appropriate system for its respective family'' [9] . Unfortunately, most ICTV Study Groups or other expert groups have not provided clear guidelines in the past, accepting strain and genetic variant names as they were suggested by different researchers in their publications rather than creating consistent nomenclature schemes that apply at least to all viruses of one family. The status quo is, therefore, that variants of particular viruses are often named according to different standards. For instance, one may be assigned a number only, whereas another may be referred to by a name, whereas yet another one may have been designated with the year of isolation. Such variety is not necessarily cause for grave concern when the number of virus variants is very limited and experts in the field are aware of them. However, their number, and in particular the number of sequences deposited in databases, has increased considerably in recent years. It is therefore becoming difficult for researchers to be aware of them, and in particular, to know their specific characteristics. Decreasing sequencing costs and ongoing improvements in sequencing technology have led to increased submission of genomic consensus sequences of viruses to databases without associated peerreviewed descriptive publications and without fulfilling (yet undefined) minimum standards for sequencing and metadata. In practice, this means that crucial information about these sequences and the associated viruses is lost when, for instance, the date of isolation or the location of isolation, i.e., the ''biological context'' in the form of metadata, are not deposited along with the sequences. In a recent report from a National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) workshop on virus genome annotation, the authors of the report concluded that ''\u2026only when information\u2026[is] included does a viral genome sequence become something more: a sample isolated in evolutionary time and environmental context, which can be compared to others, allowing inferences between sequence, host, chronology, and geography'' [3] . The amount of genomic information for members of the family Filoviridae is unlikely to become overwhelming in the short term. However, their importance in regard to biodefense measures, and recent calls for genetic filovirus variant standardization to expedite countermeasure development [18] , make them suitable candidates for name standardization trends started by influenzavirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus experts. Here, we propose guidelines for the establishment of a standardized nomenclature for natural genetic variants of filoviruses, and how to build designations for them from metadata in GenBank records and publications.",

The most commonly accepted one is the nomenclature for influenzaviruses (family Orthomyxoviridae, genera Influenzavirus A/B/C), which was published in 1953 by the World Health Organization [34] and which has since been updated several times [35] [36] [37] The influenzavirus nomenclature has proven very useful as it allows searching for and identifying particular influenzavirus isolates from the more than 190,000 deposited sequences. It is generally accepted within the influenzavirus research community and has the advantage that the isolate designation is mostly self-explanatory, allowing non-influenzavirus specialists to comprehend it quickly. Its disadvantages are that (a) it has become partially redundant because the three ''antigenic types'' of ''influenza virus'' have been reclassified as three different viruses belonging to three different species (influenza A/B/C virus, species Influenza A/B/C virus); (b) host designation permits the use of non-standardized animal names that lack specificity (such as ''duck'' ? which kind of duck?); and (c) it does not distinguish between strains and variants.",

This nomenclature is again similar to that used for influenzaviruses: The system envisions the use of particular denominators to point out missing information (''XXX''). Suffixes in the \\species of origin[ field point out whether a viral genome has been directly sequenced from a clinical specimen (''-wt'' for ''wild-type''), from tissue/cell culture-derived viruses (''-tc''), from viruses passaged through homologous hosts (''-hhp'') or from laboratory-generated or laboratoryengineered viruses that resemble viruses from nature (''-lab'') or cannot be found in nature (''-LabStr''). Contrary to other nomenclatures described here, the developers of the rotavirus nomenclature did address the need for a standardization of country abbreviations and suggested to use the unique 3-letter (''alpha-3'') country codes used by the Representation of Names of Countries (ISO 3166) as prepared by the International Organization for Standardization (see http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes.htm or https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ appendix/appendix-d.html). A minor problem of this nomenclature is that one denominator asks for ''species of origin,'' yet the provided examples list actual animals (''human'' instead of ''Homo sapiens'' for instance). Furthermore, as in other nomenclatures described above, it is unclear which vernacular name of a given animal ought to be used (for instance: should ''cougar'' be used, or should ''puma,'' ''mountain lion'' or ''mountain cat'' be chosen?). Instead, the authors provide simple examples for the ''species of origin'' denominator, such as ''mouse'' or ''bat,'' which could be more descriptive (which kind of ''mouse'' or ''bat''?), given that there are over a thousand different animals assigned to a roughly equal number of different mouse and bat species.",

This taxonomy, summarized in Table 1 , also delineates the proper use of vernacular filovirus names. It is an attempt to ameliorate the confusion that exists generally among virologists regarding the difference between virus species and viruses [4, 7, 15, [28] [29] [30] by introducing virus names distinct from species names [14] as previously requested by some experts [15, 27] . Lastly, it accommodates recent developments in filovirology, such as the discovery of two novel filoviruses that require(d) the establishment of two new species and one new genus [14, 22, 25] . Whereas the demarcation of individual filoviruses (Ebola virus vs. Sudan virus vs. Marburg virus, etc.) is now clearly defined [14] , it is unclear how to distinguish their individual subclasses (strains, genetic variants, genotypes, mutants, etc.), mainly because of a lack of definitions for these terms and the absence of generally applicable guidelines for assigning viruses to them. The result is not only inconsistency and the ensuing difficulties for non-specialists to understand manuscripts, seminars, or figures [16] , but also a broad range of different designations referring to the same filovirus, as well as typographical and transliterational errors [13] .",

In this article, a standardized nomenclature and guidelines for its further development are being proposed for natural filoviruses, i.e., filoviruses occurring in nature.

            "text": "Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted definition for the terms ''strain'', ''variant'', and ''isolate'' in the virology community, and most virologists simply copy the usage of terms from others. Here, we propose not to add to the existing confusion by constructing radically novel definitions, but rather to employ or extrapolate from the few existing definitions that have been brought forward. It is important to point out here that no matter at which classification level one examines ''a virus'', one always deals with a varied population. A virus-infected cell will, after only one round or replication, already contain a population of genomes, and virions derived from these genomes will vary slightly from each other (quasispecies [23] ). Likewise, a sample taken from a virus culture or an infected animal will contain numerous virions, many of which vary slightly (quasispecies [23] ). While single-virion analysis is theoretically possible, it certainly is not done routinely right now (it would be meaningless as far as naming is concerned), and even if it were, one would still have to work with virion populations to infect animalsand of course virions are not equal to viruses [31] . Consequently, ''a virus'', ''a strain'', ''a variant'', or ''an isolate'' always refers to populations and not to single physical entities, and their descriptions are therefore based on average properties. For instance, ''the sequence'' of ''an isolate'' is a consensus sequence of the population of genomes present in the analyzed sample. [8] . These two definitions are also reflected in the words for ''strain'' in other languages, such as German (Stamm), which back-translate to ''trunk'' rather than ''branch'', i.e., the word implies something fundamentally different from a reference entity despite it being directly related to it, possibly with little genomic sequence variation. A strain is therefore a genetically stable virus variant that differs from a natural reference virus (type variant) in that it causes a significantly different, observable, phenotype of infection (different kind of disease, infecting a different kind of host, being transmitted by different means etc.). ''Genetically stable'' means that the genomic changes associated with the phenotypic change are largely preserved over time through natural selection. The extent of genomic sequence variation is irrelevant for the classification of a variant as a strain since a distinct phenotype sometimes arises from few mutations. ''Observable phenotype'' means, for instance, that within a comparative animal experiment, it would be possible for the researcher to distinguish between the reference control virus-infected animal and the animal infected with the alleged new strain, without knowing which animal received which virus and without having any information about the differences between the two viruses. The designation of a virus variant as a virus strain would be the responsibility of international expert groups. Thus far, despite the abundant indiscriminate use of the word ''strain'' in the filovirus literature, natural filovirus strains according to this definition have not been reported. All described genetic variants of EBOV, for instance, cause a similar hemorrhagic fever in humans and even experimental animals and are transmitted similarly. None of the known EBOV genetic variants can be distinguished from others on clinical grounds alone. In fact, their variety seems to be limited to subtle differences in growth kinetics and plaque formation in vitro or subtle changes in the duration of disease in experimental animals, and ultimately derives from limited, but often stable, differences in genomic sequence [13] . This also holds true for the different genetic variants of MARV, RAVV, BDBV, RESTV, and SUDV (currently, there is only one isolate of TAFV and none of LLOV). We therefore recommend abstaining from using the word ''strain'' in context of any natural filovirus until either a particular genetic filovirus variant is discovered that causes a difference in disease phenotype and/or until expert groups establish a clear-cut definition of what ''phenotype'' means and to which extent phenotypes must differ to establish a filovirus as a strain.",

It would be the decision of international expert groups to change the designation under such circumstances.

Naming isolation hosts in this way is preferable to/more concise than using vernacular names, as these vary from language to language and one particular organism is often referred to by multiple vernacular names.

This means that future developments in filovirology may result in the demand for a modified or different nomenclature, which, however, should not be difficult to create based on the metadata collected and archived for the current system. A logical consequence of this system is therefore also the development of a database that contains the information suggested here in conjunction with metadata available from publications, other databases, or research records.

We would like to emphasize the importance of studies done with now unavailable viruses while urging that it should be made clear to readers that viruses used for said studies are not available anymore and that results of experiments done at present with a closely related isolate may therefore not necessarily fit historical results. To distinguish unavailable filoviruses, we propose to add the suffix ''-hist'' (for ''historical'') to their genetic variant names. Mediumlength designations are not necessary for ''-hist'' viruses, as genomic sequences are not available and therefore the construction of phylograms and alignments is impossible.",
