In this study, the SL-CoV N protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and used as antigen. An Indirect Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (indirect ELISA) was developed for detection of SARS-or SL-CoV infections in bat populations. The detection of 573 bat sera with this indirect ELISA demonstrated that SL-CoVs consistently circulate in Rhinilophus species, further supporting the proposal that bats are natural reservoirs of SL-CoVs. This method uses 1-2 \u00b5l of serum sample and can be used for preliminary screening of infections by SARS-or SL-CoV with a small amount of serum sample. Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) was the causative agent resulting in the SARS",

The His 6 -tagged recombinant N protein was expressed and purified by using a His-bind purification kit (cat No. 70239-3, Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

These results are inconsistent with previous reports published by ourselves and other teams ( 3, 4). Furthermore, we have detected SL-CoV infections in Myotis, suggesting that Myotis species are also susceptible to SARS-or SL-CoV. The positive sera for the SL-CoV N protein were tested for activity to neutralize the HIV/BJ01. The results showed that none of these positive sera could neutralize SARS-CoV. DISCUSSION The N protein is a major structure protein in CoV and highly immunogenic in animals. Previous studies have showed that sandwich ELISA based on the recombinant SARS-CoV N protein is sensitive and specific for the serodiagnosis of SARS-and SL-CoV infections (1, 4). However, these methods need 30-50 \u00b5L of serum sample and are not capable of testing small quantities of serum sample, e.g. sera collected from small animals like insectivorous bats. In this study we developed an indirect ELISA method using the recombinant SL-CoV N protein as antigen and used it for the detection of SL-CoV antibody. Our results demonstrated that this method is sensitive and specific and can detect SL-CoV infection with 1 \u00b5L of bat serum. Further more, the recombinant SL-CoV N protein cross reacted with antisera against SARS-CoV, suggesting that this method can also be used for detection of infections by SARS-CoV. The protein G can bind to the Fc fragment of IgG of many different species. The method developed in this study used can bind to the Fc fragment of IgG of many different species.",

The results showed that a high sero-prevalence of SL-CoV existed among Rhinolophus species, particularly in R. sinicus, demonstrating that SL-CoVs persistently circulates in Rhinolophus populations, further supporting the proposal that bats are natural reservoirs of SL-CoVs. In addition, we have also detected SL-CoV infections in Myotis, implying that Myotis species are also susceptible to SL-CoV. It is not surprising that the positive bat sera to SL-CoV N failed to neutralize the protein. The SL-CoVs have a high similarity to the SARS-CoV in most of the gene products, with the exception of the S proteins which share only 76%-78% similarity. This difference in S protein results in different receptor usage by the SL-CoV (7). Thus, antibody detection based on the N protein can be used as a preliminary screen of infections by group 2b CoVs, whereas the sera neutralization based on pseudovirus can be used to differentiate between infections by SARS-or SL-CoV.",
