By using Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we showed that the purified recombinant M protein could be recognized by four SARS-CoV-positive human sera even when those sera were 12,800-fold diluted. Furthermore, we characterized one representative IgG2 MAb, 3H9, which exhibited a strong immunoreaction to both recombinant M protein and native viral protein of SARS-CoV. We found a B-cell antigenic epitope located between amino acid 1-15 and defined the MAb recognizing region within amino acid 16-28 of M. These findings not only suggest that both recombinant M protein and its specific MAbs may be used as the diagnostic reagents for SARS, but also provide a potential target site for the design of an epitope-based vaccine against SARS.",

SARS-CoV, a novel human CoV (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus), is a large, enveloped, positive stranded RNA virus, and structurally similar to other coronaviruses. The human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, were commonly found in upper respiratory tract infection. So far, little has been done about their immunogenicities and vaccines. The structural proteins of SARS-CoV include membrane glycoproteins S, M, E and nucleocapsid protein (N). Recently, some researches reported that the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV possessed neutralizing epitopes [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, other reports showed that SARS-CoV M protein might elicit the specific antibody [7, 8] and M protein might be involved in virus assembly [9] . The exact function of M protein remains unknown.",

Many of these methods involve live viruses with high infectivity and mortality. Special facilities like the bio-safety level 3 laboratory are required. On the other hand, preparation of large amounts of recombinant SARS-CoV proteins with good immunogenicity and antigenicity as well as their specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) is very important for the usage of these diagnostic reagents and for evaluation of the safety effectiveness of vaccine. It has Chao Qian and Di Qin contributed equally to this work. been established that M protein plays an important role in other coronaviruses' life cycle and inducing immunity [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Therefore, we hypothesize that in SARS-CoV, M protein may also have such functions and may be an attractive target for anti-SARS drug research, vaccine development and the establishment of a serological detection assay. To testify this hypothesis, in the present study, we identified a B-cell antigenic epitope at the N-terminus of SARS-CoV M protein, characterized a monoclonal antibody against the protein, and defined the MAb recognizing region.",

BamHI and XhoI sites are underlined and non-specific nucleotides were positioned 5\u00a2 of restriction sites to facilitate enzyme digestion. The two DNA fragments had a 39-base pair (bp)-overlapping region, which encoded 13 aa. Procedures for cloning of the PCR products and identification of the recombinant plasmids were performed as described above. The recombinant plasmids were designated as pSARS-M1 and pSARS-M2, respectively.",

The results indicated that the purified M fusion protein still reacted strongly with all four SARS-CoV-positive human sera even when the sera were diluted to 1:12,800 (Fig. 2b) . Our data also showed that purified M fusion protein had no cross-reaction with the sera of healthy donors (Fig. 2b ). In addition, to confirm that no antibodies against GST proteins were present in SARS-CoV-positive human sera, ELISA assays were performed using purified GST proteins as antigen to coat 96-well plates. It was showed that no statistical significances were found in OD values between SARS-CoV-positive human sera and healthy human sera (data not shown).

First, our results provide direct experimental evidence that purified M fusion protein could serve as an ELISA reagent for SARS diagnosis. M protein has been previously shown to be high antigenicities in animal coronavirus. For instance, Elia et al. developed recombinant M protein-based ELISA test for detection of antibodies to canine coronavirus, which exhibited an excellent correlation with those of whole virus ELISA and Western blot [30] . Recently, although Han et al. have used the purified recombinant M protein (expressed in Pichia pastoris) of SARS-CoV as an ELISA antigen to detect four undiluted SARS-CoV-positive sera, its sensitivity remains to be evaluated [31] . Here we demonstrated that recombinant SARS-CoV M fusion protein (1-43 aa) expressed in E.coli was highly antigenic and specifically reactive with the sera from SARS-CoV-positive patients even when the sera were diluted to 1:12,800. Therefore, it suggests that our purified M fusion protein may be potentially useful as an ELISA antigen for diagnosis of SARS.",

Since outbreak of SARS in 2003, B-cell epitopes have been of particular interest to investigators who study the humoral response and design epitope-based vaccine to prevent potential antibody-mediated immunopathy [3, 4, 6] . Many of these studies focused on SARS-CoV S and N proteins. For example, by using phage-display library technique, Duan et al. has characterized a human single chain Fv (scFv), B1, which could recognize an epitope within amino acids 1023-1189 of S2 protein and has the potent neutralizing activities against infection by pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV S protein in vitro [34] . More recently, Hu et al. synthesized a 10-mer overlapping peptide library, which spanned the major structural proteins of SARS-CoV for screening and identification of linear B-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV. They demonstrated that five of assembled 22 longer peptides showed high crossimmunoreactivities to 42 SARS convalescent patients' sera from the severest epidemic regions of the China mainland. Among them, S471-503, a peptide located at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, could specifically block the binding between the RBD and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, resulting in the inhibition of SARS-CoV entrance into host cells in vitro [35] . In current study, we demonstrated a linear B-cell antigenic epitope located in the M protein between 1 and 15 aa, which was consistent with the previous reports [7, 8] . Interestingly, when we searched for potential B-cell antigenic epitopes within the fulllength M protein using Bioinformatics tools, we found that there were seven predicted antigenic epitopes within M protein (C. Lu, personal communication). Among them, the first epitope was just located at 8-36 aa of the M protein.

Lane 1: total cellular extracts from IPTGinduced BL21 transformed with recombinant pSARS-M construct (control); Lane 2: total cellular extracts from IPTGinduced BL21 transformed with recombinant pSARS-Ml construct; Lane 3: total cellular extracts from IPTG-induced BL21 transformed with recombinant pSARS-M2 construct antigenic epitope(s) may still locate in this region. While Hu et al. has identified the B-cell antigenic epitope on S2 protein, they also found that two synthesized overlapping peptides, both of which were located within amino acids 29-48 of M protein, could react to mixture of 42 SARS convalescent patients' sera, indicating that other potential B-cell antigenic epitope(s) may still locate in this region [35] . Meanwhile, our experiment showed that the recognizing region of the MAb against M fragment was in the M protein between amino acids 16 and 28. These data supported our primary hypothesis that the N-terminus of SARS-CoV M protein may play a critical role in induction of immune response, particularly in humoral immunity, in human and mouse.",

Our findings may shed light on the establishment of other valid and effective detection methods and development of epitope-based vaccine for SARS-CoV infection. Further studies are needed to better understand whether this B-cell antigenic epitope may induce neutralizing antibody in human body and to better evaluate the sensitivity of both M protein-and its MAb-based diagnostic method for SARS infection.",
