In the Middle East, EDs have been particularly affected by the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirs (MERS-CoV). MERS-CoV is a beta corona virus of the family Coronaviridae, first identified in a Saudi Arabian patient who died of acute pneumonia and renal impairment following a flu-like illness on 23 September 2012 [5] . Globally, 877 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 317 related deaths have been reported to WHO since then [6] . The recommended CDC methods [7] for the diagnosis of MERS-CoV are infiltrates on chest radiograph (CXR), a positive nasopharyngeal swab, or sputum reverse transcriptase-PCR.",

The first case was reported on 15th of August 2012, and the ED was responsible for initial screening of patients with suspected MERS-CoV.

A protocol was developed and revised multiple times during the course of the epidemic ( Fig. 1 and Appendix A, Supplemental digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/EJEM/A93). The ED created a dedicated area in the department called MERS-CoV Corona Triage and staffed it with trained healthcare professionals equipped with level 4 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) [2, [8] [9] [10] . Staff were educated on isolation procedures and the ED worked with the radiology department to prioritize patients who presented with symptoms suggestive of MERS-CoV (fever, cough, shortness of breath) to have CXR evaluation. Posters were displayed throughout the ED to educate visitors and staff on precautions and symptoms of MER-CoV. Personal emails were sent to staff whenever there were updates to the protocol on the latest developments on MERS-CoV triage, treatment, and isolation (28 revisions to date). In addition, classes were conducted by senior clinical staff to ensure compliance and the importance of PPE use was highlighted [3, 4, 14, 15] . Twelve new respiratory isolation rooms were set up and four additional rooms were modified to accommodate isolation procedures. Once a patient was identified to be at risk of having MERS-CoV, a CXR was immediately obtained. If the CXR showed infiltrates, then the patient was admitted to a respiratory isolation room. A nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples were sent for reverse transcriptase-PCR to identify MERS-CoV and other respiratory viruses. Patients with moderate to severe symptoms were treated with oseltamivir and intravenous broadspectrum antibiotics. Patients with normal CXRs and a suspicious history were discharged home with isolation instructions after obtaining nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples for PCR. The home isolation precautions continued until a negative result was obtained from the respiratory samples. If a positive result was obtained, patients were called back to the hospital to be isolated. In addition, patients were advised to report back to the department if their symptoms became worse. All patients presenting to the department with signs and symptoms of fever and acute respiratory distress were treated as probable cases of MERS-CoV until proven otherwise. If a patient was unstable, he/she was transferred to a monitored isolation bed. Any immune compromised patients with symptoms suggestive of MERS-CoV were directly placed under observation in isolation until proven negative for MERSCoV infection.",

The Pandemic Preparedness Committee worked with ED and the laboratory department to shorten the turnaround time to 1 day by ensuring optimal timing of specimen delivery to the laboratory, increasing the virology technical staff, and extending the number of shifts to cover evenings and weekends. This enhanced the process of identifying cases and discontinuing isolation early for those with negative tests and significantly reduced the number of patients admitted to the medical wards. The protocol was continually updated during the epidemic, with 28 revisions, and each revision was communicated to staff using mass emails and regular departmental meetings. A cluster of three cases of MERS-CoV, as a consequence of one patient who was not restricted to his bed, resulted in refinement of the isolation procedures and changes to the protocol to enable mandatory isolation within the hospital. This patient did not follow the isolation procedures, resulting in the transmission of MERS-CoV from an infected patient to him and then transmission from him to another patient.",

Training and auditing of staff has been emphasized in recent Ebola cases in the USA and other industrialized nations [16] [17] [18] . Without constant observation, surveillance, and reporting back of the level of compliance with the appropriate infection control measures, it is not possible to maintain a high level of compliance. It is essential that EDs quickly screen and target high-risk patients to ensure a high level of compliance for those who are truly at high risk. It is clear that different approaches are needed for different epidemics as protocols that work for an Influenza epidemic are unlikely to work for MERS-CoV, Ebola, or other emerging infectious diseases (Hamad General Hospital Emergency Department, unpublished data) [3] [4] [5] [6] . Viral load and viral shedding are disease specific and can result in different periods of potential cross infectivity. CDC's current guidelines, for example, identify temperatures of at least 100.4\u00b0F (\u226538\u00b0C) accompanied by other related symptoms as the threshold for screening Ebola patients [19] , whereas patients with MERS-CoV appear most infective when they develop pneumonic changes on CXR. Hospitals must be able to quickly adjust to a rapidly changing profile of patients as the epidemic unfolds. This requires a system-wide approach as well as a specific ED approach to implementation.",
