            "text": "Feline coronavirus infection is common among domestic and exotic felid species and usually associated with mild or asymptomatic enteritis; however, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease of cats that is caused by systemic infection with a feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a variant of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Currently, there is no specific treatment approved for FIP despite the importance of FIP as the leading infectious cause of death in young cats. During the replication process, coronavirus produces viral polyproteins that are processed into mature proteins by viral proteases, the main protease (3C-like [3CL] protease) and the papain-like protease. Since the cleavages of viral polyproteins are an essential step for virus replication, blockage of viral protease is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Previously, we reported the generation of broad-spectrum peptidyl inhibitors against viruses that possess a 3C or 3CL protease. In this study, we further evaluated the antiviral effects of the peptidyl inhibitors against feline coronaviruses, and investigated the interaction between our protease inhibitor and a cathepsin B inhibitor, an entry blocker, against a feline coronavirus in cell culture. Herein we report that our compounds behave as reversible, competitive inhibitors of 3CL protease, potently inhibited the replication of feline coronaviruses (EC 50 in a nanomolar range) and, furthermore, combination of cathepsin B and 3CL protease inhibitors led to a strong synergistic interaction against feline coronaviruses in a cell culture system.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are single stranded positive sense RNA viruses that contain the largest non-segmented RNA virus genome. Coronaviruses are responsible for highly prevalent diseases in humans and animals, and are divided into the groups alpha, beta, and gamma, based on antigenic and genetic criteria, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses infect mammals (Homes, 2001) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is classified into the beta group of coronaviruses. Feline coronaviruses belong to alpha coronaviruses and affect animals in the family Felidae, including cheetahs, wildcats, lions and leopards (Heeney et al., 1990; Kennedy et al., 2002) . Feline coronavirus is further classified as serotype I or II. Feline serotype I and canine coronaviruses are considered to have originated from a common ancestor. Feline coronavirus serotype II appears to be derived from recombination with canine coronavirus and feline coronavirus serotype I in the S (spike) protein (Herrewegh et al., 1998; Motokawa et al., 1996) . Feline coronavirus serotype I is more prevalent than serotype II, and feline coronaviruses of both serotypes can cause mild or asymptomatic enteritis and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in cats (Benetka et al., 2004; Kummrow et al., 2005; Pedersen et al., 1984a) . FIP is a fatal disease in cats and currently one of the leading infectious causes of fatality among young cats in multiple cat households and shelters (Pedersen, 2009 ). Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causes asymptomatic to mild enteritis among cats with a high prevalence (Pedersen et al., 2008; Vogel et al., 2010) . Unlike FECV which is confined to the intestinal epithelium, FIP virus (FIPV) gains ability to replicate in macrophages and monocytes by mutation of endogenous FECV and can spread through the entire body. The progression to FIP is also influenced by the host's immune responses; a weak or defect in cellmediated immune response is associated with the development of FIP (Pedersen, 2009) . Despite the fatal nature and increasing incidence of FIP, no effective prophylactic or therapeutic agent is currently available for FIPV.",

The cleavage of S proteins varies among coronaviruses. In some coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV)-2, S proteins are cleaved by cellular cathepsins that are cysteine proteases typically present within the endosome/lysosome in the cell cytoplasm (Qiu et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) . FIP and FECV are also found to be highly dependent on the presence of cathepsin B for the cleavage of their S proteins, which enables cell entry for virus replication (Regan et al., 2008) . The importance of the presence of cathepsin function in the replication of feline coronaviruses is demonstrated by the inhibition of some serotype I and II feline coronaviruses, including WSU-1683, WSU-1146, and DF2 strains, by a cathepsin B inhibitor CA074-Me and an irreversible non-specific cysteine inhibitor E64d by inhibiting the cleavage of S proteins (Regan et al., 2008) . This result indicates that cathepsin B may serve as a potential target for the development of therapeutic drugs against feline coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Following entry into the cells, coronaviruses express polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b), which are cleaved by viral proteases into intermediate and mature nonstructural proteins. The viral proteases involved in the cleavage of the polyproteins are papain-like proteases (PL1pro and PL2pro) and a 3C-like (3CL) protease. The papain-like proteases cleave the N-proximal region of pp1a/pp1ab, and 3CL protease cleaves the viral polyprotein at 11 conserved interdomain junctions (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . Coronavirus proteases, like many other viral proteases such as those of human immunodeficiency virus-1 and hepatitis C virus, for which commercial protease inhibitors are available, are highly effective regulators of virus replication. Coronavirus 3CL protease is a cysteine protease that shares common characteristics in structural and functional properties with the 3CL or 3C proteases of noroviruses and picornaviruses, respectively; they possess chymotrypsin-like folds, cysteine residue as a nucleophile, and conserved active sites. Viral 3CL or 3C protease plays an essential role in viral replication; consequently, it is an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. Previously, we reported the generation of new peptidyl inhibitors against norovirus 3CL protease and their broad spectrum activity against viruses that possess 3C or 3CL proteases, including feline coronavirus Tiew et al., 2011) . In this study, we further studied the reversibility and the mode of inhibition of our 3CL protease inhibitors, and compared the antiviral effects of the 3CL protease inhibitors (GC373 and GC376) and cathepsin inhibitors against the replication of feline coronaviruses in cells. We also studied the combined antiviral effects of GC373 and CA074-Me, a cathepsin B inhibitor, against a feline coronavirus in cell culture.",

TGEV 3CL protease at a final concentration of 0.1-0.2 lM and the substrate (Edans-Val-Asn-Ser-Thr-Leu-Gln/ Ser-Gly-Leu-Arg-Lys[Dabcyl]-Met) (Kuo et al., 2004) at 10 lM were used for the studies. Compounds at various concentrations (0-50 lM) were pre-incubated with TGEV 3CL protease in 25 ll for 20 min at 37\u00b0C, and the same volume of substrate was added to the mixture, or the compound was added to the protease immediately before the substrate was added to the enzyme/inhibitor mixture in 96-well black plate. The mixtures were then further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min, and fluorescence readings were obtained on a microplate reader at 360 nm excitation and 480 nm emission wavelengths. The relative fluorescence units (RFU) were calculated by subtracting background (substrate control well without protease) from the fluorescence readings. The dose-dependent FRET inhibition curves were fitted with variable slope (four parameters) using GraphPad Prism software 5 (La Jolla, CA) in order to determine the compound concentration that gives a half-maximum response (IC 50 ). In separate experiments, TGEV 3CL protease (0.2 lM) was incubated with serially diluted GC373 (0-2 lM) in 25 ll of assay buffer and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 min, followed by the addition of various concentrations of substrates (10-200 lM). The mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C, and fluorescence readings were obtained on a microplate reader at every 5 min for up to 30 min. The correction factors to compensate for the inner filter effects were determined empirically as described previously (Chang et The kinetic constant K m was determined by the fitting initial rates to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism software. Lineweaver-Burk plots were constructed using GraphPad Prism software to determine K i values as well as the type of enzyme inhibition. Lastly, recovery of enzymatic activity of TGEV 3CL protease over time (rapid dilution experiments) was studied to demonstrate reversible binding of GC373 to TGEV 3CL protease (Copeland, 2005; Xie et al., 2011) . Rapid dilution experiments were performed by incubating TGEV 3CL protease at 100 times the concentration that is normally used in a reaction with DMSO or GC373 at concentrations approximately 10 times greater than the IC 50 value (10 lM)",

Cathepsin B inhibitor CA074-Me and pan-cysteine cathepsin inhibitor E64d were included as controls. GC373 and GC376 remarkably inhibited the activity of TGEV 3CL protease at 50 lM, but the cathepsin inhibitors did not (Fig. 3A) . The dose-dependent inhibition of TGEV 3CL protease activities by GC373 with or without pre-incubation of the compound with the protease is shown by open circles and filled squares, respectively, in Fig. 3B . The IC 50 values of GC373 and GC376 against the 3CL protease determined in the FRET assay were 0.98 and 0.82 lM, respectively, when the compounds were pre-incubated with the protease. The IC 50 values of GC373 and GC376 against the 3CL protease without pre-incubation were 3.2 and 2.7 lM, respectively, indicating that pre-incubation of the protease with the 3CL inhibitors caused about a 3-fold increase in inhibitor potency. The K m value for the fluorogenic substrate was 15.52 lM. The Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 3C) suggested competitive inhibition of the proteolytic cleavage of the substrate by GC373 with a K i value of 0.43 \u00b1 0.06 lM. Reversibility of our compound was determined by the rapid dilution experiments. As shown in Fig. 3D , the enzymatic activity of the 3CL protease incubated with GC373 at 10 \u00c2 IC 50 concentration recovered after 100-fold dilution of the protease/inhibitor mixture. At the final concentration after the dilution, the inhibitor concentration is 10-fold below the IC 50 .

However, suppression of virus replication by the 3CL protease inhibitors was more potent than those by CA074-Me and E64d at 24 and 48 h, indicated by the EC 50 values (Table 1) . Notably, the antiviral activities of CA074-Me and E64d decreased substantially over time (Table 1). When the 3CL protease inhibitors were added to the cells at the same time of virus infection, the EC 50 values of the compounds increased by 2-to 3.75-fold, compared to those obtained from preincubation of cells with the compounds ( Table 2 ). The antiviral effects of the 3CL protease inhibitors were selective; they were not active against unrelated viruses such as influenza virus and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (data not shown). The antiviral activity of GC373 and GC376 was not due to nonspecific cytotoxicity since the 3CL protease inhibitors did not show any cytotoxicity, in various cells even at 500 lM. The cathepsin inhibitors CA074-Me and E64d also did not show any toxicity at 100 lM. The in vitro therapeutic indices calculated from the ratio of EC 50 /TC 50 of cathepsin and 3CL protease inhibitors are at least 25 and 2900, respectively, at 24 h post virus infection. These results demonstrate that the replication of feline coronaviruses is effectively inhibited by the 3CL protease inhibitors with an excellent safety margin in cells.",

The underlying mechanisms that allow the tissue tropism change is reported to be associated with mutations in the S and open reading frame 3c genes and the aberrant immune response of the host, but the detailed mechanism of the altered tropism has not been clearly established (Chang et Pedersen et al., 2012; Poland et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998) . The feline enteric coronaviruses are present ubiquitously in the environment and easily transmitted via a fecal-oral route. Thus elimination of feline coronavirus from multi-cat environments can be challenging. Although therapeutic measures for FIP are highly desirable to control this fatal disease, limited information on the effective treatment for FIP is available (Legendre and Bartges, 2009; Ritz et al., 2007) . The general treatment options for FIP are supportive therapy, including the use of immunosuppressants such as glucocorticoids, and antibiotics (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008) . Other agents that have been used include interferons, tumor necrosis factor-a inhibitor, propentofylline, and polyprenyl immunostimulant (Ishida et al., 2004; Legendre and Bartges, 2009; Ritz et al., 2007) . However, the therapeutic efficacy of those immune modulating agents was shown to be ineffective or needs further investigation in controlled trials (Fischer et al., 2011; Ritz et al., 2007) . Ribavirin was reported to reduce the replication of FIPV with an IC 50 of 10 lM and a TC 50 of 69 lM, and a later study using specific pathogen free cats infected with FIPV showed that ribavirin treatment at 16.5 mg/kg was not effective at reducing fatality or severity of symptoms (Weiss et al., 1993) . In addition, studies on the antiviral agents that directly or indirectly target virus components and/or replication steps are very limited (Barlough and Shacklett, 1994; Hsieh et al., 2010) . Our group has previously reported a series of new 3CL protease inhibitors targeting the 3CL protease of norovirus (Tiew et al., 2011) . Coronavirus 3CL protease is classified as a chymotrypsinlike cysteine protease and shares a remarkable degree of conservation of the active site with norovirus 3CL protease. Our dipeptidyl 3CL protease inhibitors incorporate in their structure a glutamine surrogate and a leucine residue that correspond to the P1 and P2 sites in the substrate (Tiew et al., 2011) . The amino acid residues in the substrate are designated as P1, P2, etc., starting at the scissile bond and counting towards the N-terminus. Likewise, the amino acid residues reside on the C-terminus side of the scissile bond are designated as P1 0 , P2 0 , etc (Schechter and Berger, 1967) . The 3CL protease inhibitors were originally developed by our group by reflecting the substrate specificity of norovirus 3CL protease where the most frequently found residues in the P1 and P2 positions at the cleavage sites are glutamine and leucine, respectively. These amino acid residues in the P1 and P2 sites are also conserved among coronaviruses, including TGEV, FECV, FIPV, MHV, and in the presence of each compound for 24 h, and virus replication was measured by the TCID 50 method. Drug-drug interactions were analyzed by the three-dimensional model of Prichard and Shipman, using the MacSynergy II software at a 95% confidence interval. Surface above the plane of 0% synergy in the plot indicate synergy.

These highly conserved features among viruses encoding containing 3C or 3CL proteases led to the finding that our dipeptidyl compounds potently inhibit the replication of noroviruses, picornaviruses, and coronaviruses including feline coronaviruses in cells . These peptidyl compounds were previously demonstrated to target coronavirus 3CL protease by the FRET protease assay and the crystal structure of TGEV 3CL protease-GC376 complex . GC373 possesses aldehyde as a potent electrophile that reacts with a cysteine (the nucleophilic sulfur) in the active site of virus protease in a reversible manner, and the bisulfite adduct warhead of GC376 was synthesized from the precursor aldehyde (Fig. 1 ). Since the bisulfite adduct is converted to the aldehyde form to form a covalent bond with cysteine in the active site of virus protease, based on the preliminary results in rats and the crystal structure of the complex of GC376 and TGEV 3CL protease, it is likely that GC376 behaves as a prodrug of the aldehyde counterpart .",

            "text": "In this study, we compared the antiviral activities of our dipeptidyl compounds and a cathepsin B inhibitor CA074-Me and nonspecific cysteine cathepsin inhibitor E64d against feline coronaviruses WSU-1683 and WSU-1146. Both virus strains are cell culture adapted type II feline coronaviruses, of which WSU-1146 is confirmed to cause FIP in experimental settings (Pedersen et al., 1984b) . WSU-1683 was originally thought to be a feline enteric coronavirus since it induced inapparent to mild enteritis without causing systemic infection in experimentally infected cats (Pedersen et al., 1984b) . However, the subsequent sequence analysis studies on the mutations of genes that may contribute to development of FIPV from FECV suggest that WSU-1683 may have lost its virulence as FIPV and reverted to FECV biotype (Chang et al., 2010; Herrewegh et al., 1995; Pedersen, 2009; Pedersen et al., 2008) . In our study, cathepsin inhibitors CA074-Me and E64d significantly inhibited the replication of feline coronaviruses at 24 h, although their potency was 13-to 100-fold lower than that of the 3CL protease inhibitors. However, a rapid loss of activity of CA074-Me and E64d was observed over time in cell culture without daily addition of the compounds, compared to the 3CL protease inhibitors. The shorter duration of the activity of cathepsin inhibitors against viral replication is speculated to be viruses overcoming the antiviral blockade imposed by inhibition of cathepsin activity by resynthesis of uninhibited cathepsins or the relative instability of the cathepsin inhibitors in media. The antiviral effects of non-specific cathepsin inhibition by E64d against feline coronaviruses were more potent than the inhibition by cathepsin B at 24 h post infection, which may be explained by differences in affinity for the protease, stability of compounds, or potential presence of cathepsins other than cathepsin B that are able to process the viral polyproteins. It was reported previously that FIPV and FECV differ in their requirement of cathepsins for the cleavage of S protein to gain entry into cells; both cathepsin B and L are required for FECV, but cathepsin L is dispensable for FIPV strains in cells (Regan et al., 2008) , suggesting the different requirement for cathepsins among the virus strains. When our 3CL protease inhibitors were added to the cells at the same time of virus infection, the antiviral activity of the compounds was reduced, compared to 2 h pre-incubation of the cells with the inhibitors, reflected by the increase of the EC 50 values by up to 3.7-fold. In the FRET assay, the IC 50 values of GC373 and GC376 against the 3CL protease also increased by about 3-fold. However, the antiviral activities of GC373 and GC376 in cells were still potent with nanomolar EC 50 values, even when the inhibitors were added to the cells at the time of virus inoculation.",
