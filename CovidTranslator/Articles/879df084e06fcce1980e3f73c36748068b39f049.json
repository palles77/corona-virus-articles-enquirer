            "text": "The 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak was an unprecedented public health crisis in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone with global impact [1] . As of December 2015, in these 3 most affected countries, there have been 28 601 cases (confirmed, suspected, and probable) and 11 300 deaths [2] . Several other countries also managed patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD), either patients with confirmed EVD transported out of West Africa [3] [4] [5] or those diagnosed after departure from outbreak-affected countries. Because the incubation period of EVD may be as long as 21 days [6] , state health departments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) implemented active monitoring policies for travelers from affected areas, with the goal of rapidly identifying individuals who meet the CDC case definition for \"persons under investigation\" for EVD (PUI) [7] . Because PUI may also unexpectedly present to urgent care or emergency department (ED) settings, it is important for frontline healthcare institutions to consider their capabilities and local public health resources as they develop preparedness plans. To facilitate safe and effective assessments of PUI, CDC developed a 3-tiered strategy that identifies hospitals as frontline healthcare facilities, Ebola assessment hospitals, and Ebola treatment centers [8] .",

Although PUI outside of endemic areas by definition may have EVD, the vast majority of them have alternative diagnoses [9, 10] . Surveillance of ill travelers from West Africa before this outbreak found that febrile and gastrointestinal illnesses are common, and Plasmodium falciparum malaria was the most frequent diagnosis [11, 12] . Similar non-EVD diagnoses have been reported in patients without EVD evaluated at Ebola treatment units in Sierra Leone [13] . Therefore, healthcare facilities must balance the need for appropriate infection control precautions while providing timely diagnosis and management of other common or potentially life-threatening travel-related illnesses that may be present. Unfortunately, delays in the diagnosis of non-EVD conditions due to infection control and prevention concerns have been reported in the United States [9, 10] .",

To ensure complete case findings, the real-time log of cases maintained by the physicians at the Emory tropical medicine clinic was supplemented by querying infectious diseases and ED staff for all PUI evaluated during the study period. During this outbreak, routine screening of all patients to identify those meeting PUI criteria were implemented at all points of entry in the healthcare system, including the ED and outpatient clinics [14, 15] . Screening questions about recent travel and symptoms of illness were asked at the time of appointment scheduling (for outpatients) and arrival at all clinics, EDs, and hospitals.

Triage to the ETU was made on a case-by-case basis and reserved for patients for whom there were high levels of concern for EVD, based on epidemiologic risk factors and clinical symptoms. Persons under investigation referred to EHC by public health authorities (after identification through active monitoring and screening programs) were also triaged in a similar manner. For the outpatients evaluated at the tropical medicine clinic, a detailed protocol for receiving the patient in an isolated ambulance entrance, security-escorted transport to the clinic, and evaluation in the clinic was developed and described elsewhere [14] . When possible, physicians at the Emory tropical medicine clinic, ED, or ETU were notified in advance of a patient meeting PUI criteria. For patients arriving unexpectedly, screening protocols were integrated into the check-in procedures in the EDs and clinics to identify and isolate PUI [14, 16] . Patients screening positive in areas not designated to evaluate PUI were urgently evaluated by an on-call infectious disease staff to confirm their status and arrange transport to the tropical medicine clinic or ED if needed.",

The screening and triage protocols that were implemented in our EDs and clinics [14] [15] [16] were critical for the prompt identification and management of these patients. Using epidemiologic screening and decision trees developed by the CDC and Emory [7, 15] , the majority of patients were determined to be of low risk for EVD, and they did not require specific Ebola virus testing. Routine Ebola virus testing for all PUI was not practical; furthermore, the imperfect sensitivity of Ebola virus testing in the first 3 days of illness [20] would have limited its utility in ruling out EVD with certainty in the majority of the patients, because most presented within 1 day after onset of symptoms. Given these limitations, the decision of whether or not to perform Ebola virus testing was individually made for each PUI, considering the epidemiologic risk, symptomatology, and duration of symptoms. Therefore, our clinical approach was to carefully evaluate each PUI, rule out other potentially lifethreatening conditions, and use Ebola testing judiciously. Because patients who recovered were considered ruled out for EVD, diagnosis and prompt treatment of other suspected or confirmed causes of infection was particularly important during the monitoring period. Although none of our patients were empirically treated for malaria, this might be considered in situations in which the patient is clinically unstable and there is limited ability to perform malaria rapid diagnostic testing.",

Given the relatively short incubation period of influenza and other respiratory virus infections, it is likely that many of the respiratory infections were acquired after arrival in the United States. The 2014-2015 North American influenza season peaked locally in the Atlanta area in December [22] , and influenza A contributed to the peak of PUI evaluated during that month (Figure 1 ). Although several patients developed influenza A infection despite immunization with the seasonal influenza vaccine (consistent with reports of limited vaccine efficacy during the 2014-2015 influenza season [23] ), the number of influenza cases observed strongly supports influenza vaccination for all travelers who do not have contraindications whenever the vaccine is available. In addition to risks of seasonal transmission in the United States, influenza is among the most common vaccine-preventable travel-related infections among international travelers [24] and can circulate year-round in tropical areas [21] . Prophylactic oseltamivir for returning travelers from Ebola-affected areas during influenza season may even be considered to reduce the chance of acute influenza illness during the 21-day monitoring period, particularly when the traveler is exposed to close contacts diagnosed with influenza.",

It is worth noting that none of the patients diagnosed with malaria had taken malaria prophylaxis, underscoring the importance of this preventative measure for travelers to endemic areas [21] . The majority of patients in this case series had traveled for Ebola response work, and none of the PUI who had traveled for Ebola response had malaria, which might be reflective of the high rates of malaria prophylaxis use reported by these patients. In contrast, the 3 patients diagnosed with malaria had traveled for other reasons, and none had taken malaria prophylaxis. A different spectrum of illness would probably have been observed if there were more travelers of other types, particularly VFR travelers, a group that often does not seek pretravel advice despite increased risk of travel-related infectious diseases [21] .",

We found that most PUI in our series had low suspicion for EVD and could be managed without admission to our ETU or testing for Ebola virus. Other Ebola assessment centers are advised to work closely with their local health departments and institutional laboratory personnel to determine their approach when evaluating PUI for EVD [25] , with particular attention to Ebola virus testing and other tests needed for the timely diagnosis of other potentially life-threatening infections. Because PUI may present unexpectedly at numerous clinical sites, we found that screening at all potential sites of patient intake was critical, including the screening of outpatients over the phone when appointments are scheduled. Precautions to minimize visibility of PUI (eg, using an alternative, low traffic entry point to the tropical medicine clinic) were important to protect patient privacy, especially because the level of PPE used may attract excessive attention from patients and staff. Evaluation of PUI in the clinic and ED was time and resource consuming in numerous ways. In addition to enhanced PPE, our protocols required dedicated staffing for each PUI at numbers beyond what is routine in the clinic or ED, and each evaluation typically required several hours total, from the time of triage to final disposition. Because PUI are restricted from using public means of transportation, the transport of PUI also presented challenges when patients lacked personal means of transport. In this situation, close collaboration with the local health department was needed to arrange for ambulance transport using appropriate precautions. Regular practice drills and tabletop exercises were important to train staff and identify gaps in our procedures. Although our procedures presumably incurred significant direct and indirect costs for our healthcare system, we believe that the high consequences of EVD warranted a specialized plan for PUI.",
