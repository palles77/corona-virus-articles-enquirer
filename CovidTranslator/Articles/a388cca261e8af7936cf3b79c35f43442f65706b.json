Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants.",

A recent study by computational modeling suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has a lower binding affinity to human ACE2, as a result of the loss of one hydrogen bond interactions 18 . However, another publication using structure analysis suggested similar binding affinities to SARS-CoV 9 . By using biolayer interferometry binding assay, Tian et al. 9 measured the SARS-CoV-2 RBD's binding affinity to human ACE2 protein to be 15.2 nM, which is comparable to previously published affinity data for SARS-CoV spike protein 19 . The above comparison of spike proteins' binding affinities to human ACE2 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were inconclusive or indirect, hence, a direct head-to-head comparison is desired for the understanding of the infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

RBD sequence alignment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the predominant residues that contribute to the interactions with ACE2. The distinct interactions of RBD and ACE2 for the two viruses are indicated by the down-pointing orange triangles and up-pointing red triangles, respectively. RBM residues are underlined. The one-residue insertion is indicated by the red arrow. Asterisks indicate positions of fully conserved residues. Colons indicate positions of strictly conserved residues. Periods indicate positions conserved residues. B. Conformational comparison between the RBD-ACE2 complex structures for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The RBD and ACE2 structures in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex model are shown as orange and pink tubes, respectively. The RBD and ACE2 structures in the optimized SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex structure are shown as blue and green tubes, respectively. The location of noticeable subtle conformational difference is indicated by an arrow. C. Distinct interaction patterns in the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 interfaces. Structures of RBD and ACE2 are shown as cartoon in pink and green colors, respectively. The side chains of the residues in both protein components, representing their unique interactions, are shown as sticks. Polar interactions (salt-bridge and hydrogen bond) are shown as blue dash line. Non-polar interactions (\u03c0-stack, \u03c0-anion, and hydrophobic interactions) are shown as orange dash line.",
