A novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), has been identified as the etiological agent for SARS (6) . For serodiagnosis of the SARS-CoV infection in clinical microbiology laboratories, the recombinant antigen-based enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting specific antibodies is well known to offer higher reproducibility and to be more easily standardized and less laborious than either an indirect immunofluorescence assay based on virus-infected cells or an ELISA based on whole-virus lysate and does not require cultivation of the SARS-CoV (12) . Since the specific antibodies to nucleocapsid (N) protein are most abundant in the sera from SARS patients (5) , several groups have developed some recombinant N protein-based ELISAs. In general, these new assays are more specific and sensitive than the ELISA based on whole-virus lysate, but some false-positive results still occurred with sera from non-SARS patients or healthy people, even with sera collected several years before the SARS outbreak (3, 7, 8, (10) (11) (12) .",

However, this concern is very minimal, since the two known human coronaviruses (strains 229E and OC43) do not cause severe clinical diseases and we still do not have data about the prevalence of the antibodies to other coronaviruses or relevant microorganisms in human populations (4, 6, 8) .

The cutoff OD 450 value for a positive diagnosis in both tests was 0.17 (mean \u03e9 5 standard deviations). With this cutoff value, no cross-reaction with the sera from healthy people was found by the N13-based ELISA, while 3.4% (1 of 29) of the sera was shown to be positive by the N-based ELISA. Of another 84 sera taken from non-SARS pneumonia patients more than 1 year before the 2003 SARS outbreak, 1.2% (1 of 84) and 6.0% (5 of 84) of them were positive by N13-and N-based antigen-capturing ELISAs, respectively, while 4.8% (4 of 84) were positive by an indirect ELISA based on whole-virus lysate. All the above-described positive reactions were confirmed to be false by immunofluorescence and neutralization assays. To compare the sensitivities of these three tests, one serum sample from a SARS patient was serially diluted twofold with SARS-CoV-negative serum and then analyzed by these assays. As Fig. 1 shows, the positive results were recorded at maximum dilutions of 1:256, 1:64, and 1:16 by the N13-based antigen-capturing ELISA, the N-based ELISA, and the indirect ELISA, respectively, and the OD 450 values from the N13-based antigen-capturing ELISA were always higher than those from the other two assays.
