            "text": "Recently, bats have gained attention as potential reservoir hosts for emerging zoonotic single-stranded (ssRNA) viruses that may prove fatal for humans and other mammals. It has been hypothesized that some features of their innate immune system may enable bats to trigger an efficient early immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a first line defense within the innate immune system and lie directly at the host-pathogen interface in targeting specific microbe-molecular patterns. However, the direction and strength of selection acting on TLRs are largely unknown for bats. Here, we studied the selection on viral ssRNA sensing TLR8 based on sequence data of 21 bat species. The major part (63 %) of the TLR8 gene evolved under purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. We also found evidence for persistent positive selection acting on specific amino acid sites (7 %), especially when compared to viral TLR evolution of other mammals. All of these putatively positively selected codons were located in the ligand-binding ectodomain, some coincidenced or were in close proximity to functional sites, as suggested by the crystallographic structure of the human TLR8. This might contribute to the interspecies variation in the ability to recognize molecular patterns of viruses. TLR8 evolution within bats revealed that branches leading to ancestral and recent lineages evolved under episodic positive selection, indicating selective selection pressures in restricted bat lineages. Altogether, we found that the TLR8 displays extensive sequence variation within bats and that unique features separate them from humans and other mammals.",

Over the past years, bats have attracted growing attention as a potential reservoir of emerging zoonotic viruses that may have a high impact on human health such as the severe acute respiratory syndromelike (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-like (MERS) coronaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, Hendra, Nipah, and other newly recognized paramyxoviruses, hepaciviruses, pegiviruses, and hantavirus, as well as new lineage of influenza A virus (reviewed in Calisher 2015) . In addition, bats have long been known as vectors for lyssaviruses causing rabies. Apparently, all aforementioned viruses are single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses and, except for lyssaviruses, cause little or no pathology in bats (e.g., Wynne and Wang 2013; Brook and Dobson 2015) . This raises the question why certain viruses can infect and persist in apparently healthy bats whereas they may cause severe symptoms and even death in other vertebrate species Bean et al. 2013; Plowright et al. 2015) .",

Resistance to virus infection can evolve by selection of mutations that alter amino acids in the binding region of receptor molecules. This sort of positively selected residues point to specific molecular recognition interfaces between host and viral components that have adapted and counter adapted in a long series of classical Red Queen conflicts and can be used to infer the history of the host-virus \"arms race\" during their co-evolution (Daugherty and Malik 2012; Hancks et al. 2015) . Thus, PRRs may rapidly evolve to evade pathogen antagonism and to ensure activation of a robust immune response. Although bats appear to share the immune cell and gene repertoire with other mammals, it has been repeatedly hypothesized that the long-term co-existence of bats and viruses must have imposed strong selective pressures on the bat genome and that those genes related to the first line of antiviral defense within the innate immune system, e.g., TLRs, may reflect this co-evolution (Wibbelt et al. 2010; Cowled et al. 2011; Baker et al. 2013; Wynne and Wang 2013; Zhang et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "Studies of the evolutionary dynamics of TLRs have revealed that selective pressures vary between TLRs and taxa. In general, a high degree of purifying selection is found for all TLRs and is particularly reported for nucleic acid-sensing TLRs due to functional constraints (Roach et al. 2005; Barreiro et al. 2009; Mukherjee et al. 2009 ). However, an increasing number of studies detected specific residues within the LRR binding region to be under positive selection in almost all TLRs (mammals: Areal et al. 2011; apes: Wlasiuk and Nachman 2010; rodents: Tschirren et al. 2011; bats: Zhang et al. 2013 , Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2015 birds: Alcaide and Edward 2011; Grueber et al. 2012; amphibians: Babik et al. 2014) indicating that the ligand-binding domain is subject to classical Red Queen conflicts as mentioned above (Daugherty and Malik 2012; Hancks et al. 2015) . Indeed, a recent study highlighted that nucleic acid sensing TLRs in bats exhibited unique mutations fixed in ligand-binding sites (Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2015) . They found further evidence for episodic positive selection acting specifically upon the bat lineage (based on eight bat species belonging to three families) suggesting potential functional differences between bat and other mammalian TLRs. Further, several ancestor genes involved in innate immunity (e.g., TLR7, NLRP3, and MAP3K7) were found to be under stronger positive selection in the genomes of the Australian black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) and David's Myotis (Myotis davidii) than their orthologues in seven other mammalian species (Zhang et al. 2013) . Interestingly, TLR7, which is besides TLR8 and RIG-1 (an intracellular PRR of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I family, Jensen and Thomsen 2012) responsible for the detection of ssRNA viruses, was one of those being under positive selection. This is remarkable because TLR7 has been suggested to be under strong purifying selection in other mammalian taxa (Barreiro et al. 2009; Georgel et al. 2009 ; but see Areal et al. 2011) . Here, we investigated traces of selection acting upon the viral ssRNA sensing TLR8 gene to shed further light on evolutionary dynamics of the viral sensing TLRs within different bat orders and their potential implications in ligand-binding affinities. In addition to the aforementioned studies, we expanded the number of investigated bat taxa to 21 bat species, belonging to seven families, to increase resolution. We included three species of the Rhinolophoidae, which are known as a main reservoir for beta-coronaviruses. Specifically, we studied the molecular variation, the strength and direction of selection, focussing on the presence of putatively positively selected amino acids in the LRR-binding region. Finally, we discuss the altered amino acid residues and their potential implications in ligand-binding affinities in detail and in comparison to new data on two ssRNA ligandbinding sites of the human TLR8 molecule (Tanji et al. 2015) .",

We captured wild bats using mist-nets or harptraps, depending on the specific efficacy, when bats emerged from their roosts. A 4-mm wing-tissue sample was collected using a sterile biopsy punch and the sample immediately stored in 96 % ethanol until DNA isolation. Liver samples (stored in RNAlater at \u221220\u00b0C) of M. myotis and N. albiventris were used for RNA analyses. Animals were euthanized in accordance with appropriate guidelines (Gannon and Sikes 2007) and under the license of national authorities. In addition, we received frozen tissue material from a museum specimen from Eidolon helvum (Natural History Museum Berlin). In Germany, we collected tissue material from four bat species that were obtained from central depositories where bats killed at wind turbines are deposited. Samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C after collection (Nyctalus noctula, Nyctalus leisleri, Vespertilio murinus, and Pipistrellus nathusii, Landesumweltamt Brandenburg, Vogelschutzwarte Buckow). Total DNA was extracted from the biopsies using standard protocols (DNA extraction Kit, Genial). RNA of M. myotis and N. albiventris was extracted using RNA extraction-kit (RNeasyKit, Quiagen). Possibly remaining genomic DNA was removed by digestion and the cDNA-library established by reverse transcriptase (RevertAid H Minus First cDNA Synthesis Kit, Fermentas).",

We estimated the relative rates of dN and dS according to the Nei and Gojobori (1986) method, applying the Jukes-Cantor correction for multiple hits in 500 replicates (Jukes and Cantor 1969) implemented in MEGA. Evidence for persistent positive selection in the past was assessed through the program CODEML (included in the software package Paml 3.15, Yang 2007), which estimates \u03c9 among sites applying different models of codon evolution (neutral, purifying, or positive). First we tested whether \u03c9 differs among sites by comparing model M0, which assumes a constant \u03c9 across all sites to model M3 (discrete), which allows \u03c9 to vary among sites, estimating the proportion of conserved, neutral and positive selected codons from the data. To test for the presence of sites evolving under positive selection we used the nested model pair M7, allowing codons only to evolve neutrally or under purifying selection and M8, which adds a class of sites under positive selection assuming a beta distribution for \u03c9. The two nested models pairs were compared using the likelihood ratio test (LRT, \u03b1 = 95 %) with two degrees of freedom (Yang et al. 2005) . For a better comparison to number and position of positively selected sites detected in TLRs of other taxa we applied a set of methods to detect candidate-codons under persistent positive selection.",

It has been suggested that the application of several selection assessment methods, followed by the classification of sites detected in consensus as positively selected can minimize false positives (e.g., Kosakovsky Frost 2005, Maldonado et al. 2014) . We applied Model M8 implemented in the PAML package and the SLAC (single likelihood ancestor counting), FEL (fixed-effect likelihood), REL (random effect likelihood), and FUBAR (Fast, Unconstrained AppRoximation analyses) methods implemented in the Hyphypackage (www.datamomkey.org; Kosakovsky Delport et al. 2010; Murell et al. 2013) . Codons with p values <0.1 SLAC and FEL, with Bayes Factor >50 for REL, and with posterior probabilities >0.9 for M8 and FUBAR were considered as candidates under positive selection. We further tested the degree of dissimilarity of amino acid substitutions according to their physiochemical properties using PRIME (Property Informed Model of Evolution), with the amino acid property set according to Atchley et al. (2005) , also available in the Datamonkey web server. A change on this properties was considered significant if the posterior probabilities exceeded >0.9. The evolutionary conservation of amino acid positions was then predicted using the ConSurf tool (Ashkenazy et al. 2010) , with the assumption that positively selected residues were least conserved.",

The LRRfinder tool (www.lrrfinder.com, Offord et al. 2009 ) was used to calculate, in addition to the domain architecture, the surface accessibility (buried or exposed) and the predicted secondary structure (helix, coil or strand) for each amino acid, which we used to discuss the potential functionality of amino acids that have been predicted to have evolved under persistent positive selection. Tertiary protein structure predictions were generated using Swiss Model (Biasini et al. 2014 ) based on the known crystallised human (hTLR8) structure. Positions of sites of persistent positive selection affecting particular amino acid positions in the protein were visualized by PyMol 1.2.8 (De Lano 2002). Amino acid positions and LRR numbering were assigned according to the human h TLR8 molecule throughout the article (Tanji et al. 2013 (Tanji et al. , 2015 .",

According to model M3 the large majority of codons evolved under purifying selection (63 %, \u03c9 = 0.06), 30 % of sites evolved neutrally (\u03c9 = 0.83) and 7 % of all sites were detected to evolve under positive selection (\u03c9 = 2.34; Table 2 ). When comparing models that estimate \u03c9 with a beta distribution also model M8 allowing for positive selection fitted the data significantly better than model M7 that considered only neutral sites (p < 0.001). To identify specific sites that might have evolved under persistent positive selection, we used different analytical approaches (see method section, Supplementary Table S4 ). Estimated PSS occurred clustered in certain regions within the amino acid sequence alignment and were all located in the ligandbinding LRR ectodomain (Fig. 1, Supplementary  Fig. S3 ).

Analyses also indicated that terminal branches of single species have been under positive selection pressure, including M. brandtii, R. hipposideros, S. bilineata, and V. murinus. The branch leading to S. bilineata might concern the whole family of Emballonuridae, because only a single species of this family was included in our analyses. The MEME analyses revealed 34 sites of episodic positive selection along branches (Fig. 2 , Table 4, Supplementary  Table S4 ). Besides lineage-specific codons, some of the identified sites coincided with codons detected to evolve as well under persistent positive selection. Position 351 involved in ligand binding and dimerization was positively selected in the ancestral branches leading to Yinchiroptera, Rhinolophoidae and within the Myotis branch. Position 539 which has been described as a ligand-binding-site mutation in bats by Escalera-Zamudio et al.

The main region concerned several PSS located in a section between LRR10-18 including the Z-loop, which has been found to be involved in dimerization and in binding uridine-rich degraded ssRNA at two distinct binding sites (Tanji et al. 2013 (Tanji et al. , 2015 . Five PSS (312, 338, 368, 420, 421, and 481) were situated in a concavity surrounded region of LRR 10, 11, and 14 and parts of the Z-loop, which are considered to bind ssRNA oligonucleotides (Tanji et al. 2015) . Here, position 338 had the strongest support by convergent findings in all our analyses and was also indicated as PSS in mammals (Areal et al. 2011, Supplementary Table S4 ). Out of the 21 amino acids predicted to be directly involved in RNAbinding at that site, 12 exhibited amino acid mutations and nine were conserved in bats (Supplementary Table S4 ). Three PSS (352, 354, and 356) were located within or next to another binding site predicted to bind the base uridine and small chemical ligands, also known to be responsible for TLR8 dimerization (Figs. 3 and 4) . Here, PSS 352 has been found to interact directly with the base uridine, as does position 351, which was found to be under episodic positive selection in bats. Some of the predicted amino acids representing this uridine binding site in hTLR8 were also conserved in bats (11 out of 16 aa) and five positions showed variable amino acid substitutions (Supplementary Table S4 ). Interestingly, PSS 447 was located in the Z-loop within a part (position 442-457) predicted to be cleaved in hTLR8 (Tanji et al. 2013) .",

In all investigated bat species, the coding sequence of TLR8 is encoded within a single large exon, which is in agreement with the gene structure of other mammals. However, indels lead to structural length differences in the LRR ectodomain between different bat families. Also, the number and location of LRRs within the ectodomain varied substantially between species, suggesting alterations in molecule structures which might have an effect on ligand-binding affinities. The observed percent sequence identities at the amino acid level were highest in the TM and TIR domain when compared to that of other mammals and within bat species, indicating the importance of a conserved function in these domains for triggering the intracellular immune cascade. These contrasts to finding in the LRR ectodomain were less similarity was found at the amino acid level indicating selection mechanisms towards amino acid mutations. Altogether intraorder variability between bat taxa was high especially in the ligand-binding LRR ectodomain, and reached percent sequence identity values as different as to that to other mammal taxa, like human and horse. This finding might point to a long history of speciesspecific adaptation processes in the co-evolution with viral pathogens within the species rich order of Chiroptera.",

            "text": "As a result of the constraints imposed by the receptor protein function, purifying selection has been argued as the dominant selective force in the evolution of all TLRs, particularly for nucleic acid sensing TLRs (e.g., Georgel et al. 2009; Wlasiuk and Nachman 2010; Fornuskova et al. 2013 ; but see Areal et al. 2011) . In bats, we found an excess of synonymous over non- ***p < 0.0001, **p < 0.001 a -2ln\u0394L is distributed approximately as \u03c7 2 with two degrees of freedom b p 0 proportion of sites were \u03c9 < 1, p 1 proportion of sites were \u03c9 = 1, p 2 proportion of sites were \u03c9 > 1 synonymous substitutions when considering the whole TLR8 gene and the LRR ectodomain exclusively, which is consistent with processes of purifying selection. However, the ratio of nonsynonymous over synonymous base pair substitutions reached a relatively high value of 0.517 for omega, a value that is much higher than those observed in most other proteins in mammals (range of \u03c9 = 0.1-0.25, Ellegren 2008). This fact was underlined in our analytical approach of codon evolution, where maximum likelihood models that allowed for positive selection fitted the data significantly better than models that considered only neutral sites indicating besides purifying selection also the occurrence of a positive selection pressure in the history of the TLR8 gene evolution. Overall, the large majority of codons evolved under neutrality or purifying selection, but 7 % of all sites were detected to evolve under persistent positive selection, a high value compared, e.g., to the TLR8 evolution in primates, where only 3 % evolved under positive selection (Wlasiuk and Nachman 2010) and might reflect the longer evolutionary history of bats compared to that of primates (first radiation of bats in the early Eocene compared to the Oligocene in primates). All positively selected sites were located in the LRR ectodomain several within or next to predicted sites involved in ligand binding, which is consistent with findings in TLRs of other taxa (e.g., Areal et al. 2011; Wlasiuk and Nachman 2010; Tschirren et al. 2011 , Escalera-Zamudio et al. 2015 Alcaide and Edward 2011; Grueber et al. 2012; Babik et al. 2014 , Vinkler et al. 2014 . As the recognition of viral RNA is essential for host defense, only such mutations that are advantageous in the recognition of co-evolving viruses should have become fixed and reflected as differences between species (Morozumi and Uenishi 2009 ). This was supported by the observation that the amino acid alterations within PSS led to physio-chemical changes. Physio-chemical alterations are thought to be important in defining the molecular structure and are therefore expected when natural selection promotes a functional change in the structure of proteins (Smith 2003 , Vinkler et al. 2014 Darfour-Oduro et al. 2015) . Our result indicate a similar or even higher level of persistent positive selection acting in TLR8 as described for non-viral TLRs in other mammalian orders (e.g., Tschirren et al. 2011; Areal et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2012 , Darfour-Oduro et al. 2015 and contrast the picture of a more constrained evolution for viral TLRs as reported for other mammalian orders (humans: Barreiro et al. 2009; primates: Wlasiuk and Nachman 2010; rodents: Fornuskova et al. 2013 ; Suidae: Morozumi and Uenishi 2009; Darfour-Oduro et al. 2015 , but see mammals: Areal et al. 2011) . However, we lack information about the diversity of non-viral TLRs in bats, thus an intra-order comparison of viral and non-viral TLR evolution is still needed for the order of Chiroptea.",

We found evidence that the branches leading to higher taxonomic clades have undergone episodic positive selection at several amino acids sites, indicating that the ancestral species within these lineages, especially those of Rhinolophoidae and Pteropodidae, had to undergo adaptive changes at these sites in response to their pathogen environment. Additionally, we detected episodic positive selection in terminal branches leading to single species (M. brandtii, R. hipposiderus, M. brandtii, and V. murinus). Our results indicate that repeated episodes of positive selection, interspersed with purifying selection shaped the observed TLR8 diversity pattern throughout the evolution of bats, and we assume that this adaptive process is currently still in operation.",

Crystallographic analyses of the human TLR8 revealed that this region binds degradation products of ssRNA at two distinct sites (Tanji et al. 2015) . One site within the concave surface of LRR10-14 interacts with ssRNA oligomers of different length and different sequence motifs, but seems to prefer sequences containing purine-pyrimidine dinucleotides. The other site is known to interact with small chemical ligands (e.g., imiquimod, R484) and to bind non-phosphorylated uridine mononucleoside and is furthermore important for the correct dimerization of the TLR8 dimer. These two sites have a synergistic immunostimulatory effect, because uridine-binding has to be stimulated by ligand-binding of RNA-oligonucleotides, but only uridine binding provokes reorganization of the dimer into the active conformation (Geyer et al. 2015) . Thereby, it is conceivable that species-specific pyrimidine rich RNAs determine whether TLR activation is initiated or not. Some PSS (312, 338, 368, 420, 421, and 481) where located in next proximity of this binding site and three of them (236, 338, and 481) , matched with PSS in mammals which did not include any chiropteran sequence (Areal et al. 2011) . Here, we found strongest support for PSS at position 338. Whether these PSS might be involved in ligand binding of RNA oligomers Fig. 2 Phylogenetic tree for Chiropteran TLR8.

Tertiary structure was generated by Swiss-Model based on known human-crystallized TLR8-dimer, ligand-binding site predicted to be involved in dimerization and binding the base uridine (Tanji et al. 2015) are indicated in light (\u03b1-chain) and dark green (\u00df-chain).

According to the 3D localization, a likely involvement in dimerization seems to be possible (Fig. 4) . The amino acids at the cleavage site in the Z-loop (441/442) showed variable amino acid alterations in bats including a deletion of three amino acids in Vespertilioninae (corresponding to human SYA) and coincided with a deletion of five amino acids in mouse and rat (human: RQSYA). The deletion of this motif has been stated to be responsible for the dysfunction of TLR8 in rodents and has been suggested as an important determinant for distinct ligand recognition between rodent and non-rodent TLR8s (Liu et al. 2010; Govindaraj et al. 2011) .",

            "text": "Whether and how the interspecific variation of TLR8 detected in bats play a role in TLR8 activation after binding to the RNAs from different viral pathogens is a complex question. However, it is well known that non-synonymous amino acid alterations at sites which are not directly involved in pathogen binding might indirectly influence the pathogen-binding ability of a receptor by, e.g., changing the conformation of the dimer structure in both the inactivated and activated form (Gautam et al. 2006; Tschirren et al. 2011; Geyer et al. 2015) . This could also account for the three other detected PSS rich regions located outside the defined ligand-binding region of the hTLR8. There is also accumulating evidence that in distinct TLRs different species recognizes either a different ligand or that a particular TLR ligand interaction does not induce the same response within different hosts, as a result of structural differences between the proteins (e.g., TLR4: Lien et al. 2000 , Lizundia et al. 2008 TLR5: Anderson-Nissen et al. 2007 ; TLR8: Govindaraj et al. 2011) . Concerning TLR8, for instance imiquimod failed to activate hTLR8, but activated bovine and porcine TLR8 (Zhu et al. 2008 (Zhu et al. , 2009 ; mouse TLR8 failed to respond to ligand stimulation in the absence of polyToligodeoxynucleotides, most probably because of the missing RQSYA motif (Gordon et al. 2006 , Liu et al. 2010 ; and the synthetical ligand R848 induced human and sheep TLR8 activation 10 to 15-fold, whereas bovine and cat TLR8 were induced less than 5-fold (Liu et al. 2010 ). These variable results indicate complex mechanisms involved in TLR8 dimerization and activation which vary between different species and might concern also TLR8 function within bats. Differences in either ligand-recognition and/or receptor-ligand interactions as well as modifications in the dimer conformation are thought to reflect co-evolution of a host TLR with species-specific microbes, allowing for the detection of species-specific pathogens or discrimination between pathogenic agents and tolerated commensals (Werling et al. 2009; Govindaraj et al. 2011) . Within the co-evolution of bats and their viruses, it could thus be speculated that viruses may inactivate TLR8 simply by inhibiting correct dimerization or conformation of ligandbinding sites.",
