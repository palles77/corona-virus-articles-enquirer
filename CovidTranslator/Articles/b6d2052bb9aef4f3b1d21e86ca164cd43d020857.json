We find that women harbor 31 strains more closely related to those harbored by their familial and social contacts than men; and that 32 transmission patterns of oral-and gut-associated microbiota need not be the same.

Overall microbiome 109 functional profiles also failed to capture transmission signals (Supplementary Figure 20), though this does 110 not negate the potential contributions of individual virulence-or transmission-associated genes 111 contributing to transmissibility. We hypothesized that perhaps the abundance of each organism would be 112 indicative of its overall transmissibility, favoring a mass-action model of transmission, yet this was not 113 the case (Figure 2c,d). 114 These findings lead to an apparent paradox: if most bacteria are transmitted directly between 115 members of the community, then why don't we observe clearer patterns of transmission? We believe 116 there are several factors that contribute to the 'diffuse' signal for transmission observed across this 117 population. First, despite this relatively 'closed' network of individuals, there are inherent difficulties in 118 capturing the full range of individuals' contacts and exposures. Our best approximations of direct transfer 119 may be far from actual events, where indirect transfer between individuals outside of the network or 120 transmission from unknown and unsampled environmental reservoirs may play a consequential role. 121 Second, we focus on a snapshot in time, not knowing a priori what types of interpersonal interactions 122 result in transfer nor whether transmission occurs during particularly volatile points in an individuals' 123",
