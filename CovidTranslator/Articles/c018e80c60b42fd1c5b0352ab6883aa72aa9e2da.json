Patients who have been operated on or who have undergone anticancer chemotherapy in the month preceding the appearance of the virus had a higher risk (75%) of developing a severe episode than those who had not undergone surgery or chemotherapy (43%).

The aerosol released into the room during surgery (leaks) or after the operation (exsufflation), can contaminate personnel and all the furniture and surfaces in the room via airborne particles. If the laparoscopic approach is chosen, surgeons must (i) make sure all the instruments are in order and the aspiration system operates correctly; this last must be used systematically, before incision via a check list, (ii) make appropriate openings to introduce trocars without leakage and use balloon trocars if available, (iii) not create a leak if smoke is hindering surgery, but instead use the aspirator to remove the smoke, (iv) aspirate the whole peritoneal cavity before making an auxiliary incision and when the operation is completed before the trocars are removed.",

The latest research findings show that patients with tumours are more prone to infection by Covid-19 owing to their systemic immunodeficient status caused by the disease, oncological treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy) and surgery. Patients operated on or undergoing chemotherapy in the months preceding the infection had a serious form of infection in 75% of cases, representing a relative risk calculated by multivariate analysis of 5.34 (CI95% 1.80-16.18, p = 0.0026) (1). In this light, exposure of patients to added risk of post-operative morbidity and mortality must be considered and factored into the choice of strategy made.",
