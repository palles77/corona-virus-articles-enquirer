Both vaccines elicited CD4 + T-cell responses, but with significant differences in the phenotype of the Gag-specific cells: the native Gag induced CD4 + responses with a phenotype of central memory-like T cells (CD28 + CD45RA \u2212 ), whereas the LAMP/Gag chimera induced CD4 + responses with effector memory phenotype (CD28 \u2212 CD45RA \u2212 ). Antigen-specific T cells producing both IFN-\u2425 and TNF\u2423 were found in the animals receiving the native Gag, whereas the LAMP/Gag chimera induced humoral responses faster. These results demonstrate that modification of intracellular Gag trafficking results in the induction of distinct immune responses. Combinations of DNA vectors encoding both forms of antigen may be more potent in eliciting anti-HIV-1 immunity.",

            "text": "The major histocompatibility complex type II (MHC II) processing compartment (MIIC) is a lysosomal-like organelle that plays an important role regulating T-cell antigen processing and presentation. Targeting antigens directly to the MIIC compartment of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have been shown to successfully enhance and modulate the immunogenicity of several antigens [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Lysosomal associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1) normally is present in MIIC of immature APCs. The effects of LAMP-1 targeting on the elicited immune responses have been analyzed in immunization studies in several mouse strains, macaques, and in humans. Several laboratories have reported that targeting antigens with the tyrosine based motif (YQTI) of LAMP-1 [1] [2] [3] can enhance the immune responses against a variety of antigens from many pathogens, including HPV-16 E7 and E6; HIV-1 Gag, Env gp120, Env gp160, and Nef; West Nile virus preM-E; dengue 2 preM-E; SARS coronavirus N; listeriolysin \"O\"; and tumor antigens such as the thyroid hormone receptor (TSHR), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTert) and human melanosomal antigen (MAGE-3) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In general, the LAMP-1/antigen chimeras were shown to elicit broader repertoire of antigen-specific CD4 + T-cell responses, greater functional avidity, augmented proliferative response and ability to secrete a variety of interleukins. The increased CD4 + T-cell mediated responses produced by the LAMP-1/antigen formulation are thought to medi-ate enhancement in B cell and CD8 + T-cell responses, as well as the development of immunological memory. When compared to the non-targeted molecules, LAMP-1/antigen chimera elicited higher antibody titers, increased antibody affinity and neutralizing activity, as well as expansion of the number of recognized B-cell epitopes. Similarly, the CD8 + responses were found elevated in several LAMP-1/antigen chimeric systems, as assessed by tetramer staining, IFN-\u2425 enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), cytotoxicity assays, and the functional avidities and T-cell response repertoires of CD8 + cells. The longevity of the immunological memory of B cells and CD8 + cells was also increased in animals immunized with LAMP-1/chimeras [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

Each animal was immunized via the intramuscular (IM) route five times at weeks 0, 4, 14, 24 and 36 with 2 mg of optimized gag or LAMP/gag plasmid using a biojector. HIV-1 Gag-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were determined as described in Fig. 2 . Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and HIV-1 Gag-specific IFN-\u2425 ELISPOT assay were performed as described [12] . The ELISPOT assays were considered valid only when the negative controls had less than 5 spot forming cells (SFC) and the positive controls more than 500 SFC. Responses were considered positive when the sample produced more than 10 spot and the signal in the presence of peptides minus two standard deviations was higher than the signal in the medium control sample plus two standard deviations. Mucosal samples including mouth swabs, nasal and rectal washes were collected periodically. Antibody titers were determined as described [14] , using either a 1:100 dilution of the individual sera samples collected over time or end-point dilutions using a pool of the sera collected at 2 weeks post vaccination 3 and 5, respectively. The reported optical density (OD) corresponds to the value minus three times the OD value of a non-immune serum. The reported titers correspond to the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that gave a three times higher OD value than the corresponding dilution of a non-immune serum. The determinations were performed in duplicate.",

Gag was found in both the cell-associated and the extracellular fractions of transfected cells. We noted further that the fusion to LAMP led to a small increase in protein accumulation in the supernatant (Fig. 1B , right panel) compared to the levels obtained from pCMV-gag.kan encoding the native Gag protein, possibly due to protein stabilization of the LAMP chimera. We have made similar observations studying other HIV-1 and SIV proteins fused to LAMP (V. Kulkarni, C. Bergamaschi, M. Rosati, G.N. Pavlakis, B.K. Felber, unpublished). LAMP/Gag chimera is identical to the protein produced from the previously published vector and was found to colocalize with MHC class II molecules as expected [14] .

As outlined in Fig. 4A , CD3 + T cells were identified within the main lymphocyte population, gated based on their forward and side scatter characteristics. The T cells were also divided in CD4 + or CD8 + cells (middle panel). In addition, subsets of memory T cells were identified based on the presence or absence of CD28 and CD45RA staining: CD3 + CD45RA \u2212 CD28 + represents the population of central memory-like (CM) T cells and CD3 + CD28 \u2212 represents effector memory (EM) T cells (middle panel). In some experiments, staining for CCR7 was also performed, and we found that more than 90% of the T cells show a similar pattern of CD28 and CCR7 expression in all the animals analyzed (data not shown). This is in agreement with the designation of CD3 + CD45RA \u2212 CD28 + cells as T cells with central memory-like surface markers. Using a combination of directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies for cell surface immunophenotyping and intracellular cytokine staining (IFN-\u2425, TNF\u2423, IL-2) of the T cells, the frequency of cytokine + cells (as sum of IFN-\u2425, TNF\u2423, and IL-2 secreting cells) was established within each of these populations (Fig. 4A, bottom) . Fig. 4B and C shows the analysis of the cytokine + T cells in the two vaccine groups at two time points (immunization 3 and immunization 5 + 2 weeks). At the time of the 3rd DNA immunization there was no difference in the frequency of antigen-specific CD3+ T cells between the two groups (Fig. 4B, upper panel) . The number of cytokine + HIV-1 Gag-specific T cells increased at two weeks after the 3rd DNA vaccination in both the gag and LAMP/gag chimera groups (data not shown), and these levels remained similar in the two groups for the entire follow-up period including at 2 weeks post 5th immunization (Fig. 4C, upper panel) .

Analysis of antigen-specific immune responses in the CD8 + T-cell population showed a significant increase in Gagspecific immune responses over the course of the immunization (day of 3rd immunization compared to 2 weeks post 5th immunization; p = 0.0140) in animals that received the CMV-gag.kan plasmid ( Fig. 4B and C, bottom panels) . At 2 weeks post 5th immunization, the group vaccinated with the native Gag had significantly more cytokine-producing CD8 + T cells, compared to the LAMP/Gag group (p = 0.0464, Mann-Whitney test). These data suggest that the fusion to the LAMP signal may induce a more polarized type of immune response, which is controlled predominantly by CD4 + T helper responses and results in earlier antibody production (see below).

Macaques that received the vector expressing the native Gag protein produced antigen-specific CD4 + T cells with a CM phenotype (Fig. 5, middle panel) . Since we did not use CCR7 in these stainings, we cannot exclude that some of the CD28 + CD45RA \u2212 antigen-specific T cells are transitional cells lacking CCR7 expression. This population of cells was significantly increased at 2 weeks post 3rd vaccination and remained at elevated levels up to the 5th immunization (Fig. 5, middle panel) . In contrast, macaques that received the LAMP/Gag chimera showed antigenspecific CD4 + T cells with EM phenotype (Fig. 5, lower panel) . A significant increase in the EM cell population was detected after the 5th immunization with the LAMP/Gag chimera but these changes were absent in animals immunized with the vector encoding the native Gag protein.",

High anti-Gag immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers (1:2700) were present in the pooled sera after 3 DNA immunizations with LAMP/Gag chimera as compared to <1:100 with the native Gag, indicating more effective antibody priming with the LAMP/Gag chimera ( Table 1 ).

On the other hand, depletion of CD4 + central memory T cells is a landmark of disease progression [22, 25, 26] . Clearly, a broad and balanced immune response including both central and CD8 effector memory T cells is desirable in a vaccine against HIV-1. Although central memory cells have been associated with viral control, effector memory cells disseminated in mucosal sites may be a first line of defense. The different properties of the two gag plasmids used in this study open the possibility of combining plasmids encoding native and modified antigens for the generation of optimal responses, which may combine central and effector memory cells.",

The presence of these dual functional cells secreting two cytokines could be of great importance, because it has been shown that the preservation of these cells correlate better with protection during natural infection than the magnitude of the total antigen-specific T-cell responses [24] . It is noteworthy that the T-cell responses elicited by the intramuscular inoculation of Gag-encoding DNA vectors result mainly in IFN-\u2425 producing cells, with low frequency of TNF\u2423 + cells and absence of IL-2 production. These findings do not appear to be related to the detection sensitivity of our assay because the SEB-stimulated cells used as positive control produced all three cytokines and the frequency of IL-2 + cells was higher than that of either IFN-\u2425 or TNF\u2423 secreting T cells (see Fig. 6A ).",

In contrast, HIV-1 infected individuals classified as long-term non-progressors typically have multifunctional memory T cells producing IFN-\u2425 and TNF\u2423 [27] , which is similar to the macaques immunized with the DNA expressing the native Gag. IL-2 production by memory T cells has also been associated with better prognosis [28] ; we did not find significant numbers of Gag-specific IL-2 + T cells in any of the vaccinated animals. The lack of IL-2 production could be overcome by improving the DNA delivery method. In fact, our recent results using DNA immunization of rhesus macaques by electroporation demonstrate increased cell-mediated responses with generation of IL-2 secreting cells [33, 34] .",

            "text": "The route and method of DNA delivery (i.e. intramuscular injection, electroporation) influences the breadth of the immune responses and the type of the induced antigen-specific T cells [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Recent data indicate that electroporation of DNA plasmids encoding SIV or HIV-1 Gag increased DNA vaccination efficiency in rhesus macaques [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] and led to the induction of antigenspecific multifunctional T cells [31, 33, 34] . In the present report, we demonstrate that different forms of HIV-1 Gag (the native HIV-1 Gag and LAMP/Gag chimera) are able to induce diverse immune responses in rhesus macaques. To our knowledge, this is the first report directly comparing different DNA encoded HIV-1 Gag proteins in the macaque model, demonstrating that altering antigen intracellular trafficking modulates immune responses. In addition, the use of 11 rhesus macaques per group allowed for statistical analysis and demonstrated statistically significant difference in immune responses. Previous immunogenicity experiments in mice using vectors encoding the native HIV-1 Gag or chimeras with several forms of LAMP proteins support this observation [9] . In the mouse study, we found broader epitope recognition in animals immunized with either LAMP-1 or DC-LAMP chimeras compared to the native form of Gag. In addition, we also found higher frequency of Gagspecific T cells, measured by either ELISPOT or tetrameric staining of CD8 + T cells, induced by the LAMP/Gag vaccine. Furthermore, we reported that mice immunized with the LAMP-1/Gag chimera showed a predominant Th type 2 response with IgG1 production and presence of IL-4 + Gag-specific T cells, as compared to mice immunized with the DC-LAMP/Gag construct in which the antibody response was predominantly mediated by IgG2a and the frequency of IL-4 producing T cells was significantly lower. These immunogenicity studies in mice demonstrated the critical role of the specific antigen targeting in eliciting distinct immune responses. In another DNA vaccination study in macaques, we further reported that fusion of SIV Gag with the chemokine MCP-3 led to increased humoral immune responses compared to the native Gag [16, 19] . Future studies are required to address the question whether combining DNA plasmids expressing different modified forms of an antigen provides better protection, as suggested by some experiments [16, 19] . In summary, modification of the posttranslational fate of an antigen, in addition to optimization of RNA expression, provides another approach to improve immunogenicity of antigens, to amplify desirable vaccine responses, and to further increase the efficiency of DNA vaccines.",
