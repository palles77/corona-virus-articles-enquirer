As new information is acquired, taxonomies will need to change. Some of the recent changes in the taxonomy of living organisms have involved the highest classes in the hierarchy. The first division of the Eukaryotes was assigned to Class Bikonta and Class Unikonta (analogous to dicot and monocot division in Class Angiospermae) [69] . Class Protoctista has been dropped from the formal taxonomy. Class Rhizaria was introduced. Class Microsporidia was moved from Class Protoctista to Class Fungi.

Taxonomic instability impacts negatively on clinical practice. When the name of an organism changes, so must the name of the associated disease. Consider \"Allescheria boydii.\" People infected with this fungal organism were said to suffer from the disease known as allescheriasis. When the organism's name was changed to Petriellidium boydii, the disease name was changed to petriellidosis. When the fungal name was changed, once more, to Pseudallescheria boydii, the disease name was changed to pseudallescheriosis [102] . Changes in the standard names of a fungus, appearing in the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, should trigger concurrent changes in the standard nomenclatures of medicine, such as the World Health Organization's International Classification of Disease, and the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings, and a variety of specialized disease nomenclatures.

            "text": "Chapter 27, Nematoda \u00c0 Astute readers will notice that the prefix \"trich\" appears often within this chapter on Class Nematoda: Trichostrongylus, Trichocephalida, Trichinellidae, Trichinella, and Trichuris. A wide assortment of organisms, diseases, and medical terms contain the root \"trich\" (pronounced trick) and produce similar-sounding terms (i.e., homonyms). If you want to avoid confusing one disease with another, it is best to \"come to terms\" with this \"trichy\" nomenclature. The suffix \"trich\" comes from the Greek \"thrix,\" meaning hair. Various unrelated organisms with a hair-like appendage, are provided with the \"trich\" suffix. Likewise, medical conditions of the hair are provided the same suffix: trichosis is any pathologic condition of hair; trichilemmoma is a tumor of hair, trichobezoar is the medical term for a hairball, trichotillomania is compulsive hair pulling. Words that sound somewhat like \"trich\" include trachoma (caused by the bacteria, Chlamydia trachomatis) and trachea (the windpipe). In addition to Trichomonas, there are several unrelated \"trich\" organisms that cause disease in humans: Trichinella, Trichomonas, Trichomonad, and Trichophyton. Other \"trich\" diseases include: Trichostrongylosis trichinosis, trichuriasis, trichomoniasis, trichiasis (everted eyelashes that touching the cornea or conjunctiva, often a post-infectious condition).",
