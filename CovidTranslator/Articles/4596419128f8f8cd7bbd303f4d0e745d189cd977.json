            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is animal virus belonging to family coronaviridae (Annamaria, 2011) . According to present virus taxonomy of ICTV (international committee of taxonomy viruses), the coronaviridae family comprises the subfamily coronavirinae and torovirinae. The subfamily coronavirinae is classified into genera alpha-, betaand gammacoronavirus, instead of phylogroups 1 through 3 (Annamaria, 2011; Carstens, 2010) . TGEV, together with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), canine coronaviruses (CCoVs), feline coronavirus (FCoV), belongs to alphacoronavirus (Annamaria, 2011; Carstens, 2010) . In phylogenetic analyses of the genomic region downstream of the S gene, TGEV consistently clusters with extant CCoV-II field strains, suggesting that TGEV is likely to be of canine coronavirus origin (Lorusso et al., 2008; Decaro et al., 2007) . Like other Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has been reported to induce apoptosis in swine testis (ST) cells. However, the mechanisms underlying TGEV-induced apoptosis are still unclear. In this study we observed that TGEV infection induced apoptosis in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells in a time-and dose-dependent manner. TGEV infection up-regulated FasL, activated FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway, leading to activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid. In addition, TGEV infection down-regulated Bcl-2, up-regulated Bax expression, promoted translocation of Bax to mitochondria, activated mitochondriamediated apoptotic pathway, which in turn caused the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-9. Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways activated downstream effector caspase-3, followed by the cleavage of PARP, resulting in cell apoptosis. Moreover, TGEV infection did not induce significant DNA fragmentation in ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) pretreated PK-15 cells or cells infected with UV-inactivated TGEV. In turn, block of caspases activation also did not affect TGEV replication. Taken together, this study demonstrates that TGEV-induced apoptosis is dependent on viral replication in PK-15 cells and occurs through activation of FasL-and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways.",

In consistent with in vivo pathologic changes, TGEV also induces cytopathic effects (CPE) when propagated in vitro cultured cells (Eleouet et al., 1998; Solorzano et al., 1978) .

Results showed that caspases-8, -9 and -3 specific inhibitors significantly prevented cell death as expected (Fig. 2C) . To further determine the effect of initiator caspase-8 or -9 on the activation of caspase-3, we analyzed the inhibitory efficacy of caspase-8 or caspase-9 inhibitor in caspase-3 activity in TGEV-infected cells. The activity of caspase-3 was significantly inhibited in cells in the presence of caspase-8 or caspase-9 inhibitor, and was more significantly inhibited by combining the two inhibitors (Fig. 2D) .

As shown in Fig. 3A , the protein levels of FasL were notably increased in a time-and dose-dependent manner, whereas Fas did not show any changes after TGEV infection. To further determine the mechanism whereby FasL expression was increased, we examined FasL mRNA levels in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the mRNA levels of FasL significantly increased as early as 4 h p.i., and continued to increase with infection time (Fig. 3B) , suggesting that FasL expression is up-regulated in TGEVinfected cells.

To test whether Bid is involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis, we measured the changes of Bid in cells upon TGEV infection. Western blot analysis revealed that tBid appeared in mitochondrial fractions at 8 h p.i., and maintained a high to infection with TGEV (10 MOI) for 24 h. The activity of caspase-3 was measured by colorimetric assay kit. The relative caspase-3 activity (caspase-3 activity with inhibitor/caspase-3 activity without inhibitor) was calculated, after the activity of caspase-3 in cells treated with TGEV or/and inhibitors subtracted the background value (caspase-3 activity in cells without virus and inhibitors). Values are mean AE SEM. **P < 0.01 versus TGEV infection alone without inhibitors. level in subsequent times in TGEV-infected cells but not in mock-infected cells (Fig. 3D) . However, following incubation with z-IETD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase-8, tBid could not be detected in TGEV-infected cells (Fig. 3E) . Moreover, the activation of caspase-9 was partly blocked in TGEV-infected cells in the presence of caspase-8 inhibitor compared to that in cells without the inhibitor (Fig. 3F) , suggesting that block of caspase-8 activity could affect Bid cleavage and caspase-9 activation. Take together, these results suggest that apoptosis signals from the FasL are transmitted to activate caspase-8, which in turn cleaves Bid, activates mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, followed by caspase-9 activation, and that other apoptosis signals might contribute to the activation of caspase-9.",

In contrast, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-X L can prevent this occurrence (Shimizu et al., 1999) . In the present study, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax were detected by Western blot assay and qRT-PCR. In TGEVinfected cells, protein levels of Bax exhibited an apparent increase in a time-and dose-dependent manner, whereas the protein levels of Bcl-2 were down-regulated in a timeand dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) . Consistent with the changes of protein levels, the mRNA levels of Bax were upregulated in TGEV-infected cells as early as 8 h p.i. and continuously increased until 48 h p.i. (Fig. 4B) .

In TGEV-infected PK-15 cells, the activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 and cleavage of PARP were observed, while inhibition of these caspases activities significantly attenuated the apoptotic effects of TGEV infection. These results suggest that the activation of caspase cascades is involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis in PK-15 cells. Similar results have been found in other coronaviruses, including canine coronavirus and infectious bronchitis virus (De Martino et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "There are two main signaling pathways contributing to caspases activation, death receptor and mitochondrial pathways. Death receptor pathway is initiated by death receptor ligation followed by recruitment of adaptor molecules and activation of upstream caspases (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998) . Mitochondrial pathway is dependent on the process of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to the release of toxic proteins from mitochondria, which is subject to the regulation by Bcl-2 family proteins (Shimizu et al., 1999) . Fas/FasL-mediated signaling has been reported in apoptosis in response to infection of several viruses such as Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) (Lin et al., 2009 ) and murine coronavirus (Liu and Zhang, 2007) . Our current study revealed that the induction of apoptosis by TGEV infection was preceded by increased expression of FasL, which was followed by subsequent activation of caspase-8 and -3. This finding demonstrates that caspase-8 activation in TGEV-infected cells can be mediated by ligation of Fas and FasL. Mitochondrial apoptotic signals are controlled prominently by the Bcl-2 family proteins, which include a number of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins to regulate apoptosis progress by changing relative levels (Shimizu et al., 1999) . Some viruses can encode proteins homologous to Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis, while some viruses can induce apoptosis by modulating the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins (Cheng et al., 1997; De Martino et al., 2010; Umeshappa et al., 2010) . Our results showed that TGEV infection down-regulated Bcl-2, up-regulated Bax expression, promoted Bax translocation from cytosol to mitochondria, and induced the release of cytochrome c, resulting in PK-15 cell apoptosis. These results are consistent with the observation in murine and canine coronaviruses (Chen and Makino, 2002; De Martino et al., 2010) , suggesting that modulation of Bcl-2 members might be a key step for coronaviruses induction of CPE and eventually cell death.",

In this process, activated caspase-8 cleaves Bid to tBid, which translocates to mitochondria and initiates the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, leading to caspase-9 activation (Yin, 2000) . Our results also provided evidences for the potential crosstalk between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in TGEV-induced apoptosis. Blocking caspase-8 activity using z-IETD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase-8, did not completely abrogate caspase-9 activation, suggesting that caspase-9 is activated not only by caspase-8 activation but also by other upstream apoptotic signals. In our system, the higher expression of p53 in TGEV-induced apoptotic cell death (our unpublished data) might be involved in the regulation of this process.",

Our results showed that inhibition of virus uncoating prevented the occurrence of apoptosis and that UV-inactivated TGEV lost the ability to induce apoptosis, suggesting that TGEV-induced cell apoptosis depends on viral replication. Then, we investigated whether caspases activation in cells is required for TGEV replication in cells. Although our results showed that inhibition of caspases activation could increase total viral titer, the increase of viral titer is proportionate with the effects of cell viability increase derived from the inhibition of caspases activation, suggesting that block of caspases activation does not affect TGEV replication in fact. All these findings suggest that viral replication is crucial for the induction of apoptosis in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells.",
