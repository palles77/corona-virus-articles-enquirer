            "text": "Despite vigorous effort and substantial financial investments, we still do not have in hand a pluripotent stem cell (PSC) that can be safely and efficiently employed to regenerate damaged tissues and organs. Despite a lot of promises, it is difficult even in animal models to demonstrate, in a reproducible way, that any of the proposed murine PSCs can rebuild organs, contributing not only to fragments of parenchyma but also to vessels, nerves and lymphatics. Therefore, taking into consideration the huge interest and expectations of the public, we should pursue all possibilities and alternative approaches to finding such cells, combine our efforts without hostility and unnecessary competition and leave aside financial interests related to patents, company stock and funding by private investors or government agencies. If embryonic stem cells derived by therapeutic cloning in humans work and are safe, why not try them? 1 Similarly, if induced PSC technology turns out to be effective and safe, why not try this technology in the clinic? [2] [3] [4] [5] But why in this competition are there so many attempts to condemn stem cells isolated from adult tissues? In fact, because of their safety, stem cells isolated from adult tissues are the only ones that have so far been tested in clinical settings. However, we are aware and we have clearly stated several times that many of the positive effects of adult stem cell therapies are related to their paracrine effects, 6-10 but at the same time, we cannot exclude other more direct mechanisms. 6, [11] [12] [13] There has been much debate of late challenging the existence of pluripotent VSELs, these cells which were first isolated in my (MJ Ratajczak's) laboratory 10 years ago, 14, 15 and since have been experimentally confirmed by several independent groups. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Scientific writers fuelled this dispute by mediating their personal views through highly respected journals. 25, 26 Very unfortunately we found many errors and inaccuracies among their accusations. In truth these critical comments were recruited from a rather narrow group of investigators.",

In brief, the small nucleus of attacking scientists declared that VSELs, like other stem cells isolated from adult tissues, have no future in regenerative medicine, and in fact are artifacts. What is absolutely deplorable in our minds is the claim that clinical trials based on VSELs were a fake, or at least were not justified. We cannot help thinking that this was an attack on a grant allotted to investigators working on VSELs through a peer review system by the National Institute of Health and Department of Defense in the United States.",

The unprecedented furor that has been generated around this topic makes one wonder what is really going on? We prefer not to comment on the insinuation that the Vatican is using VSELs to try to control science. 25, 26 Some of us are Catholic, like many others, and yes, we have started this research through curiosity.

[36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] These stem cells have been given various names, depending on the assays by which they were identified. In most of these reports, the stem cell that differentiated into cells from different germ layers has not been directly identified at the single-cell level. Thus, there was always the unanswered question: what stem cell is ultimately responsible for all these multitissue differentiation phenomena? We believe that many of us studying stem cells residing in adult tissues that display early-development markers and show broader differentiation potential are in fact looking at similar, overlapping populations of stem cells that can be quiescent 44 but, if activated, are able to expand into different lineages. These cells reside at different levels of germ layer/tissue specification and can be detected if appropriate experimental tools are employed.",

These dormant, early-development cells show several epiblast/ germline markers that suggest their embryonic origin/ deposition and relationship to early epiblast-derived migrating primordial germ cells (PGCs, Figure 1a ). Epigenetic changes in imprinted genes, such as erasure of the maternal type of imprinting at differentially methylated regions, which are specific marks in PGCs to prevent them from undergoing teratoma formation, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] are also responsible for the quiescence of VSELs in adult tissues. As imprinted genes (for example, those encoded at the Igf2-H19 locus) are involved in insulin/insulinlike growth factor signaling (IIS), epigenetically regulated resistance of VSELs to IIS regulates their quiescent state. 54 However, although these cells can be activated and mobilized into peripheral blood during several known physiological emergencies, 55-60 they may also be involved in maintaining the pool of tissue-committed stem cells. The number of VSELs correlates with lifespan, [61] [62] [63] and their potential role in tumorigenesis requires further attention. 64, 65 Murine BM-purified VSELs possess several in vitro features expected from PSCs, such as a characteristic morphology in transmission electron microscopy (a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio with a thin rim of cytoplasm, the presence of euchromatin and few mitochondria), and express Oct-4 and Nanog at the mRNA and protein levels, 14 which has received further confirmation by promoter methylation studies showing their association with histone codes that promote transcription. 49 Furthermore, VSELs express bivalent domains at promoters of developmentally important transcription factors, 66 and female VSELs reactivate the X chromosome. 67 In appropriate culture systems, these cells can also differentiate into cells from different lineages. Murine VSELs, however, do not form teratomas and do not complete blastocyst development, which is a key feature of classical PSCs, such as embryonic stem cells or induced PSCs. However, this lack of pluripotentiality of murine VSELs should not be surprising, because early-development stem cells present in the adult body should be well protected from the risk of teratoma formation.",

The expression of some of these crucial genes has been confirmed subsequently by demonstrating the presence of transcriptionally active promoters. 68 Based on the molecular similarity between VSELs and PGCs, we presented the hypothesis that one of the mechanisms that keep VSELs quiescent in adult tissues is similar to the one that governs quiescence of PGCs and is based on epigenetic modification of paternally imprinted genes (Figure 1b) .",

In support of this concept, we observed that a 10-day administration of all these sex hormones directly stimulated expansion of VSELs and HSCs in BM, as measured by an increase in the total number of these cells in BM (B2-3x) and enhanced 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation (the percentage of quiescent BrdU \u00fe Sca-1 \u00fe Lin \u00c0 CD45 \u00c0 VSELs increased from B2% to B15-35%, and the percentage of BrdU \u00fe Sca-1 \u00fe Lin \u00c0 CD45 \u00fe HSCs increased from 24% to 43-58%) (K Mierzejewska, manuscript in preparation).",

            "text": "Overall, our 2008 paper demonstrated for the first time that the quiescent state of the most primitive stem cells in murine BM can be regulated by epigenetic changes of imprinted genes, 49 as seen Figure 1 . The overall concept of a presence of developmental early epiblast/germline-derived stem cells in adult tissues. (a) Retention of germline potential during ontogenesis. Cells with germline potential are shown in blue. The earliest and the most primitive cell in the germline is the totipotent zygote. The germline potential is subsequently retained during development in Oct-4 \u00fe cells located in the inner cell mass cells (ICMs) of the developing blastocyst, epiblast stem cells (EPSCs), primordial germ cells (PGCs) and gonocytes in gonads. Epiblast/ germline potential could also be retained in rare early-development small VSELs deposited during development in peripheral tissues as founders for more differentiated monopotent tissue-committed stem cells. Some of these small cells express Oct-4 (shown in blue). (b) The cycle of life-from zygote to germ cells. From a developmental and evolutionary point of view, the germline (shown by red arrows) carries the genome (nuclear and mitochondrial DNA) from one generation to the next, and all somatic cell lines bud out during ontogenesis from the germline to help germline cells accomplish this mission effectively. The germline potential is established in the fertilized oocyte (zygote) and subsequently retained in the morula, inner cell mass of the blastocyst (ICM), EPSC, PGCs and mature germline cells (oocytes and sperm). The first cells that bud out from the germ lineage are trophoectodermal cells, which give rise to the placenta. Subsequently, during gastrulation, EPSCs are a source of PSCs for all three germ layers (meso-, ecto-and endo-derm) and PGCs. We hypothesize that at this stage some EPSCs and PGCs are deposited as Oct-4 \u00fe VSELs in tissues developing from meso-, ecto-and endo-derm (blue circles). Blue box and yellow arrows pointing at VSELs indicate mechanism based on epigenetic modification of parentally imprinted genes (for example, at Igf2-H19 and KCNQ1p57 Kip2 loci) that keeps these early-development cells quiescent in adult tissues. A similar mechanism based on erasure of imprinting also regulates the quiescent state of PGCs.",

            "text": "in the case of PGCs (Figure 1b ). This has been somehow very recently confirmed in a paper by Venkatraman et al., 74 who found that most primitive LT-HSCs in murine BM are kept quiescent by the maternal type of imprinting at the Igf2-H19 locus, which confers resistance to IIS. As mentioned above, we provided evidence that VSELs may become specified into LT-HSCs. 45, 46 RECENT DATA FROM INDEPENDENT LABORATORIES THAT SUPPORT THE EXISTENCE OF VSELS As mentioned above, several primitive cells with the characteristics of pluripotency or multipotency were identified in adult murine and human BM, UCB and adult solid organs that were enzymatically processed to get cell suspensions for analysis. Such cells, more or less depleted of lineage-positive cells, [36] [37] [38] [39] [75] [76] [77] [78] were cultured and expanded in vitro, usually as adherent cell populations, and if they expanded into cells from different tissues, they were assigned various operational names such as multipotent adult stem cells, 36 multipotent adult progenitor cells, 39 MIAMI cells, 37 multilineage-differentiating stressenduring (Muse) cells 76, 79 or unrestricted somatic stem cells. 38 Unfortunately, the phenotype of the most primitive stem cell that initiated these cultures has never been clearly described. In addition to assays based on in vitro cultures, other isolation strategies have also been employed, for example, an interesting population of small cells (ELH stem cells) isolated from murine BM by elutriation (E), lineage depletion (L) and the ability to home (H) to BM has been described, which is able to differentiate into epithelial cells and HSCs. [80] [81] [82] Another group reported the presence of small cells (known as 'spore-like stem cells') in adult mammalian tissues that are able to differentiate into cells from all germ layers and have been isolated from adult mammalian tissues. 83 Moreover, several recent reports based on fluorescenceactivated cell sorting multiparameter sorting strategies were published that supported the existence of small, primitive VSELs and VSEL-like cells in adult tissues (the most important are listed in Table 1 ). For example, murine BM-sorted Sca-1 \u00fe Lin \u00c0 CD45 \u00c0 VSELs have been shown to give rise to type 2 pneumocytes, which produce lung surfactant protein after transplantation into surfactant-deficient mice. 17 Furthermore, small SSEA1 \u00fe Lin \u00c0 CD45 \u00c0 cells that express Oct4 \u00fe sorted from rat BM gave rise in vivo to cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells in an experimental model of rodent acute myocardial infarction. 47 Furthermore, Sca-1 \u00fe Lin \u00c0 CD45 \u00c0 VSELs cells from murine BM 16 or human mobilized peripheral blood 18 cells expressing the SSEA4 \u00fe CD133 \u00fe CXCR4 \u00fe Lin \u00c0 and CD45 \u00c0 phenotype and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting formed murine and human bones, respectively, when embedded in gelatin sponges and implanted into immunodeficient mice. This boneforming activity exceeded the activity of the other populations of BM-purified cells that were evaluated using the same assay. Based on this finding, it has been proposed that these BM-and mobilized peripheral blood-purified VSELs are at the top of the hierarchy for the mesenchymal and endothelial lineages. 16, 18 Cells similar to BM-derived VSELs have been reported to reside in the ovarian surface epithelium in postmenopausal ovaries 19, 48 and normal testes 20 and were able to differentiate into gamete-like cells. As reported, these gonadal VSELs express nuclear OCT-4A, whereas the immediate descendants of these cells express cytoplasmic OCT-4B isoform. 19, 20 Furthermore, human mobilized peripheral blood VSELs have been successfully purified by other researchers, 18, 21 and very small Oct4 \u00fe Sox2 \u00fe cells corresponding to UCB-derived VSELs described by us 15, 46 were purified from UCB by other investigators, who described them as a population of UCB-derived VSELs 23, 84 or UCBderived embryonic-like stem cells. 85, 86 Interestingly, these cells were able to differentiate in vitro into neural progenitor cells. 85 Finally, a corresponding population of primitive Oct4 \u00fe stem cells that resembles VSELs and was named omnicytes was also described as circulating in UCB and was capable of migrating into the maternal circulatory system. 87 In addition to the cells listed in Table 1 , in a recent report, small cells with some VSEL markers were also identified in murine neonatal retina. 88 In another study, small non-hematopoietic lineage-negative (Lin \u00c0 ) cells isolated from adult BM by elutriation (Fraction 25 or Fr25) were involved in retinal regeneration following the induction of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and optic nerve crush injury in a rodent model. 89 In addition, a similar population of small non-hematopoietic CD45 \u00c0 stem cells harvested from BM via elutriation was recently shown to differentiate in vivo into functional insulin-producing cells in chemically induced diabetic mice. 90 Similar small cells isolated by elutriation were reported in the past to give rise to LT-HSCs. 80 Thus, VSELs and VSEL-resembling cells have recently been purified in several laboratories worldwide, and we can expect that the coming years will bring more new information regarding their biology and in vitro and in vivo differentiation potential.",

Eukaryotic cells incubated with SYTO dyes generally show cytoplasmic or mitochondrial staining, as well as nuclear staining'. This was confirmed in recent publication. 99 As cell ploidy is defined by DNA content, clearly SYTO dyes cannot be used as ploidy markers, and the accuracy of the authors' ploidy estimation can be called into question. Despite this obvious mistake, based on the cell distribution shown in Figure 2C On the contrary, we consider the fraction of smaller cells (FCS low ) appearing as Sytox16 dim cells (originally Figure 1C 29 and shown as Figure 2a in this article, red box) to represent potential VSELs because of their well-known low cytoplasmic content and greater resistance to DNA staining, which has been characteristic of these cells in our experience as well as that of other groups. 17, 19, 96, 100 Unfortunately, as Miyanishi et al. 29 decided to sort the Syto16 bri cells (which most likely belong to the CD45 int subpopulation of progenitors or erythroblasts in the analyzed material) as 'VSEL candidates', we are not surprised that they were unsuccessful in isolating VSELs in subsequent steps. Because of this crucial mistake and their resultant focus on the wrong population, the authors' statement 'This indicated that our VSEL candidates were the relatively larger cells in the population analyzed, unlike the VSELs The Sytox16-related signal may vary between cell populations, raising questions about its discriminatory role for diploid cell identification, and this problem is also clearly visible in the example of the CD45 hi /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe cell fraction (located on the border of the \u00b110-mm bead size, originally Figure 1C 29 and shown as Figure 2a in this article, green box), which is close to a half log unit brighter than the majority of FSC hi /CD45 hi /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe cells. 29 We would like to ask: what does this mean? Does Syto16 indicate that these cells are proliferating, 3n, or are they in fact 2n and all fractions that the authors interpret as diploid have indeed a lower DNA content? There must be more controls and more cautious interpretation in such analysis.",

            "text": "VSELs: an update MZ Ratajczak et al years, we clearly suggested that primitive Oct-4 \u00fe , SSEA-4 \u00fe cells should be sought within the much rarer fraction of CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 / CD133 \u00fe cells. 46, 97 Unfortunately, Danova-Alt et al. 27 disregarded our recently published results and followed an incorrect population that we initially isolated 5 years ago and then further studied. 15, 46, 97 Interestingly, although these authors concluded that CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 cells from UCB essentially lack CD34 and CD133 antigens, these cells are visible even in their histograms (originally Figure 2B 27 and shown as Figure 2b in this article, upper panel), but the authors inexplicably overlooked the rare objects, including the VSEL fraction, 27 which we clearly indicated in our analysis done on dot plots (Figure 2b, lower panel) . It is clearly apparent that both CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 /CD34 \u00fe and CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 /CD133 \u00fe cells are present in at least some UCB samples analyzed by Danova-Alt et al., 27 which are indicated in their original histograms by blue boxes marking rare objects corresponding to both populations (Figure 2b , UCB samples 1, 2 and 3). Another important technical problem is that the authors instead of using for CD133 staining as VSELs: an update we recommended in our original protocols antibodies against CD133/1 epitope 100 employed not optimized for VSEL isolation an anti-CD133/2 eiptope antibody (clone: 293C3). Similarly, in the third of the 'con' papers, Szade et al. 28 went a step further and tried to set up an entirely new protocol for isolation of murine VSELs, discounting our already published strategies, and eventually sorted a fraction distinctly different from very small CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe cells, thus presumably losing the VSELs during isolation. Using their de novo protocol, these authors 28 made several cardinal mistakes, including: (1) setting up an enlarged input gate on the forward scatter (FSC) vs side scatter (SSC) plot that, on one hand, included granulocytes and apoptotic cells, resulting in enrichment of sorted fractions with artifacts reflected in further analyses (for example, Annexin V binding) and, on the other hand, excluded some of the critical very small objects from further sorting (originally Figure 1A 28 and shown as Figure 2c in this article); (2) losing very small objects further by cutting them out during gating for 'singlets' (originally Figure 1A 28 and shown as Figure 2c in this article); (3) focusing on selection markers that were not proven to be expressed on VSELs (for example, c-kit); and (4) a selective focus on some populations and discarding other fractions (containing potentially VSELs) based on a superficial interpretation of results such as Annexin V binding. 28 For instance, the entire fraction of CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe /c-kit \u00c0 /KDR \u00c0 was excluded by the authors from further sorting because it was deemed 'apoptotic' (Figure 2 28 ), although it most likely contained not only real Annexin V \u00fe /FSC low /SSC dim/hi apoptotic objects, but also VSELs. Importantly, we have found that healthy normal cells (including VSELs and HSCs) may bind Annexin V following lysis of red blood cells because of microvesicle/microparticle release and posphatydylserine transfer to the membranes of the normal cells. 101 Thus, not all Annexin V \u00fe objects should be interpreted as 'apoptotic', as these may sometimes represent normal, functional cells. 101 In this regard, even though Miyanishi et al. 29 tried to follow our protocols, we noticed several other flow cytometric concerns when analyzing the identification and sorting approaches used by this group. 29 For instance, (1) how is it possible that, following red blood cell lysis, the unfractionated BM cell population does not contain any Syto16 \u00c0 /Sytox-Blue \u00fe objects, and all events are shown to be uniformly nucleated or 2n (based on the authors' Sytox-16 signal interpretation) healthy cells (originally Figure 1C 29 and shown as Figure 2a in this article, magenta box), whereas Syto16 \u00c0 /Sytox-Blue \u00fe objects are shown in subfractions of BM cells in the same analysis (how much of this analysis is reliable?) or (2) why are there, in fact, so few cells indicated in the size region B4-10 mm in the original Figure 2C (shown by an arrow in Figure 1 in this article), although this population was much more prominent in the analysis shown in the original Figure 1 (shown as an example here in Figure 2b )-are these vast numbers of cells resembling VSELs lost following Sytox16 staining or software compensation? Answers to these and several other questions are crucial for the academic community to understand the discrepancies in proper VSEL identification and sorting encountered by Miyanishi et al. 29 as well as other groups struggling with VSEL isolation. 27, 28 We plan to highlight these methodological aspects in more detail in a separate paper focusing exclusively on flow cytometric pitfalls and techniques in rare stem cell characterization, including for VSELs.",

            "text": "Moreover, Miyanishi et al. 29 focused particularly on VSEL cellsize evaluation (originally shown as Figures 1 and 2 , and Figure S1 in Miyanishi et al. 29 ). They, for instance, compared the BM cell distribution with bead standards on different sorting machines (both Aria (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and MoFlo (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA)) and pointed to visible discrepancies. We understand that this approach was related to our sorting protocols suggesting standard-sized beads for gate set-up. However, when it was already clear from their initial experiments (shown in the first and second dot plots in the 29 described and subsequently isolated large-size, Syto16-bright, CD45 \u00c0 /int /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe murine cells as 'VSEL candidates' (lower left plot, blue box), whereas in our opinion, a visible population of smaller, Syto16-dim cells is the most likely VSEL population (lower left plot, red box). Syto16 is not an optimal DNA dye, and its staining also depends on other intracellular components. It is, for instance, visible in the CD45 hi /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe population (lower right plot, green box), which is almost a half log unit brighter than the majority of FSC hi cells (lower right plot, black box). Moreover, we have a general concern about Sytox-Blue and Sytox16 staining in this study because unfractionated BM cells do not contain any debris or dead cells in such a sample (upper right plot, magenta box), which are visible within subfractions of these cells. (Dot plots were adopted from a paper by 27 in their recent studies focusing on human VSEL isolation, concluded that CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 / CD133 \u00fe cells (which we consider in fact to be a population enriched in human VSELs) as well as CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 /CD34 \u00fe cells do not exist in CB, whereas such cells are not only found in our samples (lower dot plots, VSELs marked with blue circles), but also in some CB samples ( 28 in their recent studies on VSELs tried to set up a new protocol for murine VSEL isolation. They were unsuccessful, as they focused on an incorrect fraction and, importantly, lost VSELs during an incorrect gating process. 28 A fraction of the very small objects was lost during: (1) gating on the FSC vs SSC plot (left plot, original gate is shown in black, whereas the suggested classical gate for VSELs is shown by a red circle) and (2) excluding doublets (right-hand plots, original gates are shown in black, whereas suggested gates are shown as red boxes, and arrows indicate areas where VSELs were most likely excluded from sorting gates). (Dot plots were adopted from the paper by Szade et al. (PLOS One; 2013, 8, e63329; part of Figure 1A) published in an open-access journal under Creative Commons Attribution License). 28 (d) Images of selected murine cell populations used for size calculation by imaging cytometry. The left panel shows FlowSightderived brightfield images of CD45 \u00c0 /int /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe /Sytox16 \u00fe objects that were isolated as 'VSEL candidates' by Miyanishi et al.. 29 Despite the fact that these cells do not represent the VSEL population described by the Ratajczak group, the quality of images is too poor for accurate quantitative analyses, including size calculations. 29 Importantly, images were collected on the instrument with a low sensitivity that may not be useful for VSEL characterization (scale indicates 20 mm). (Images were adopted from the paper by Miyanishi 29 The middle panel represents size analysis performed by Szade et al. 28 using the ImageStream X system. The histogram shows size analysis of CD45 \u00c0 Lin \u00c0 Sca-1 \u00fe c-Kit \u00c0 cells, where objects 4-5 mm in size are unfortunately excluded from analysis (as indicated by the orange box), whereas the images are confusingly derived from the distinct CD45 \u00c0 Lin \u00c0 Sca-1 \u00fe c-Kit \u00fe cell fraction, which does not represent VSELs. Importantly, the quality of images is too poor for accurate data analysis. (Data were adopted from the paper by Szade . 28 The right panel shows representative images of murine VSELs (CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe /7-AAD \u00fe cells), HSCs (CD45 \u00fe /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe /7-AAD \u00fe cells) and platelets (CD41 \u00fe /7-AAD \u00c0 objects) obtained with the ImageStream 100 system and used for VSEL size analysis. 96 Importantly, with an optimized instrument and good-quality images, even objects as small as 2-mm platelets may be visible and quantified by IDEAS software. Cyan areas show masking used for calculations of cell size by Zuba-Surma et al. 96 original Figure 1 ) 29 that the cell-size measurement based on the beads employed was not accurate on the particular Aria instrument used for experiments (as all murine white blood cell populations appeared erroneously to be 410 mm), the authors continued the size comparison, which was in fact irrelevant to the final sorting outcome. On the other hand, the authors should reevaluate gating on the instrument they used and VSELs should be sought in the fraction of objects between 4 and 6 mm or even between 4 and 8 mm rather than 4 mm, as all objects are shifted to the upper FSC values when compared with beads (original Figure 1) 29 .",

Unfortunately, these size comparisons obviously did not bring the authors closer to successful VSEL isolation.",

Gating for FSC vs SSC dot plots exclusively on lymphocytes (excluding granulocytes and FSC low /SSC hi objects that may enrich the sorted fraction with different artifacts, apoptotic cells and so on) with extension of the gate to include FSC low /SSC low objects, where a clear cutoff from debris is visible (as shown by our gating strategy in Figure 3 ). Set up a gate enclosing Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe cells to avoid erythroblast contamination. Apoptotic cell and erythrocyte contamination was reported in the paper by Szade et al., 28 the group that significantly modified sorting and eventually isolated a murine BM cell population distinctly different from VSELs. Moreover, the gating for sorting was performed in an untidy fashion, and very small cells were lost at different steps 28 (Figure 2c ). Thus, any major change in gate set-up that results in VSELs being unnecessarily mixed with other objects should be carefully avoided. Use dot plots to visualize populations. We generally do not recommend using histograms for any identification and sorting of rare fractions of stem cells, including VSELs. Although in our initial sorting protocols we used histograms visualizing, for example, CD45 expression for final separation of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, 14, 96 we gradually became aware that replacing such a histogram with dot plots (for example, CD45 vs SSC) was much more informative and gave a better gating set-up ( Figure 3) . Moreover, we found that rare cells such as human VSELs have been simply overlooked by other investigators using histograms showing expression of CD133 and CD34 in CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 human UCB samples, 27 although these very rare SCs would be clearly visible in the same samples and in the same analyses if, for instance, CD133 (or CD34) vs SSC dot plots are employed 97 (Figure 2b) . Importantly, we also exclude any contour plots from our sorting and analysis protocols, which were used by Miyanishi et al., 29 as in our opinion they flatten the view and do not provide complete information about low cell number clusters and the single-cell distribution when we focus on isolation of unique rare objects. We believe that employing contour plots may also potentially lead to technical problems in sorting of rare SCs, as the clear borders of subpopulations are not easily visible. Eventually, when gated properly, CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe cells will 'come back' as a homogeneous population of small objects in a FSC vs SSC dot plot following back gating (Figure 3) . Importantly, our established protocol for murine VSEL isolation has already been successfully followed and fine-tuned by several laboratories and investigators, including groups in the United States, France, India, Japan and Poland, [16] [17] [18] [19] 21, 22, 88, 91, 103 a fact that was not appreciated by any of the investigators (Miyanishi et al., 29 Danova-Alt et al. 27 and Szade et al. 28 ) who faced problems with VSEL sorting.",

            "text": "We have also noticed the interest by Miyanishi et al. 29 in VSEL size measurements by imaging cytometry, a technique in which we are highly skilled and often use in our studies. 94, 96, 97, 104 Unfortunately, in our opinion, FlowSight (Amnis Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA) is not an optimal choice for morphological examination of very small objects such as VSELs. Indeed, the authors should be aware that all of our previous analyses (which they questioned in their paper 29 ) were performed with a much more powerful, sophisticated and higher-magnification ImageStream (Amnis Corporation) system. 94, 96, 97, 104 Based on our observations, although FlowSight is capable of analyzing a majority of large cells with its single \u00c2 20 objective and fixed optical configuration, 105 it cannot provide images of VSELs of the quality required for reliable image processing, accurate masking and feature calculations by Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS). We have already performed such analyses in our laboratory with a FlowSight demo instrument, and we could not obtain reliable IDEAS data based on FlowSight acquisition, even for human VSELs, which are much larger cells than their murine counterparts (E Zuba-Surma, unpublished data). Therefore, and importantly, the majority of small murine VSELs would not be easily visible on a FlowSight instrument because of its limitations in object resolution. This is also reflected by images in the paper by Miyanishi et al. 29 (original Figure S1C 29 and shown as Figure 2d in this article, left panel). FlowSight, with its standard optics pixel resolution of 2 mm, which may be increased maximally to 1 mm/ pixel with the Quantitative Imaging Upgrade, still lacks sufficient resolution for accurate VSEL size measurements. 105 Based on our extensive experience in VSEL size evaluation and imaging cytometry, the following facts have become apparent: (1) the only current imaging cytometer that is optically capable of visualizing VSELs is the ImageStream system (both ImageStream 100 and ImageStream X systems, which were used in our VSEL studies), (2) the quality of images of analyzed objects undermines the accuracy of size measurements by IDEAS software for such small objects as VSELs, which is related, for example, to accurate masking set-up by the software, (3) the masking performed by IDEAS should always be verified by the investigator and often finetuned (for example, decreased), as the contribution of the cellular halo is much more prominent for small objects than for larger cells, significantly affecting the size calculation when masking automatically based on the brightfield image. [94] [95] [96] [97] 100, 104 Unfortunately, the data on size measurements by imaging cytometry provided by Miyanishi et al. 29 do not in fact challenge our previous results 96 because: (1) these studies were not performed with the high-resolution ImageStream system (our major concern), (2) the quality of the images was poor compared with the VSEL images used for initial calculations by Zuba-Surma et al. 96 (Figure 2d ) (major concern), (3) the CD45 \u00c0 /int /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe /Sytox16 bri larger-cell population was analyzed excluding the Sytox16 dim fraction that resembled 'VSEL candidates' (major concern), (4) no information was provided about the analytical approach, including the type of masking or the features used for size calculation, (5) a small number of objects was analyzed and (6) the preparation of cells before analysis was different than in our previously reported studies. 29 Moreover, it would be very valuable to see all-channel images of the only five small objects included in the analysis (original Figure 2D in Miyanishi et al. 29 ), which could give further ideas about morphology and the potential similarity of these objects to the previously described VSELs. On the other hand, the authors showed only highly contrasted brightfield images of analyzed cells. 29 Most importantly, in our opinion, an incorrect population was included in the analysis, and it would be much more valuable to investigate CD45 \u00c0 /int /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe /Sytox16 dim cells based on their full images, including all stained marker populations, to evaluate both size and potential cell content for assessing the VSEL presence in this fraction. Unfortunately, such an analysis will be reliable only when performed on the more capable ImageStream system. However, even access to the high-quality ImageStream X system does not guarantee good-quality images that would provide accurate cell-size measurements, as was evident in the study by Szade et al., 28 who failed to isolate VSELs. These authors contradicted our reported results, whereas, in fact, the image quality of objects used for their size measurements was very poor ( Figure S2 in Szade et al. 28 and Figure 2d in this article, middle panel). Furthermore, the population they focused on as VSELs (CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe /c-kit \u00fe ) was not comparable to our reported cells. On the other hand, the authors carelessly excluded potentially crucial objects (4-5 mm in size based on their unknown masking and diameter measurements) from size analysis in the CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe /c-kit \u00c0 fraction, which could contain VSELs ( Figure S2 in Szade et al. 28 and Figure 2d in this article, middle panel). Thus, such analysis, even performed on an ImageStream X system, was not professionally performed, which underscores the importance of a skilled and knowledgeable flow cytometry-skilled operator who can fully understand and interpret data generated by this state-of-the-art machine. Importantly, the paper by Zuba-Surma et al. 96 represents one of the first studies in the stem cell research field that employed imaging cytometry for identification and morphological characterization of rare and small-sized stem cell objects, and all calculations were performed in close collaboration with a scientific representative of Amnis Corp. to ensure correct object identification and data accuracy (as shown in example images used in this study and shown in Figure 2d , right panel). Moreover, it was the first paper that clearly showed that the fraction of FSC low /SSC low /CD45 \u00c0 /Lin \u00c0 /Sca-1 \u00fe cells sorted by classical flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) may not only contain a great amount of debris and artifacts, but also include small cellular objects such as VSELs. 96 We further showed a similar phenomenon, with even more debris because of enzymatic digestion, for isolation of VSELs from solid tissues. 95 It is noteworthy that all of our previous VSEL size measurements were performed with a \u00c2 40 objective and a resolution of 0.5 mm per pixel (on ImageStream 100 and ImageStream X systems, Figure 2d , right panel). . Agranular, small events ranging from 2 to 10 mm (as initially set up with Flow Cytometry Size beads, Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) are included in an 'extended lymphgate' on an FSC vs SSC dot plot (region R1; a). The population of cells from region R1 may be additionally depleted of doublets (gate R2; b) to enhance sorting purity (b). The single-cell fraction from gate R2 is further analyzed for Sca-1 and Lin expression and exclusively Lin \u00c0 / Sca-1 \u00fe cells are gated (R3) to avoid erythroblast contamination (c). The population from region R3 is subsequently separated into CD45 \u00c0 and CD45 \u00fe subpopulations visualized in regions R4 and R5, respectively, on a CD45 vs SSC dot plot (d). CD45-dim objects are preferentially included in the CD45 \u00fe population (region R5). If BM cells are gated strictly according to these steps (with special caution for R1, R3, R4 and R5 gate set-up), the populations of VSELs and HSCs derived from regions R4 and R5, respectively, separate cleanly when 'back-gated' on FSC vs SSC dot plots (e). Both stem cell fractions may be additionally purified by final gating, including size-related regions R6 and R7 for VSEL and HSC sorting, respectively. Percentages represent the content of each fraction in the representative murine BM sample.",

            "text": "Murine BM-derived VSELs are very well described at the morphological and molecular levels and express several morphological and molecular marks that support their pluripotent character. In addition, evidence has accumulated that these cells cross germ layers in their differentiation potential. The fact that they do not form teratomas and do not complete blastocyst development is well explained by changes in expression of certain paternally imprinted genes. Is it really essential that a PSC should show these properties? There should be scientific deliberation on this-in fact this inability to form teratoma may prove to be a very positive feature; such cells might be destined for regenerative medicine. On the other hand, we have always emphasized that, in contrast to their murine counterparts, much work still needs to be done to better characterize human VSELs. Finally, we frankly wonder why, faced with the difficulties of characterizing VSELs by a handful of other groups, 27-29 these groups have not openly, as is usual in science, requested our help. The scientists are wholeheartedly welcome to address themselves to us.",
