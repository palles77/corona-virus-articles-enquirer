Among immunocompromised patients, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) pathogens were the most frequently identified, and prevalences did not differ from those in immunocompetent patients. Risk factors for immunocompromise were independently associated with neither Pseudomonas aeruginosa nor non-community-acquired bacteria. Specific risk factors were independently associated with fungal infections (odds ratio for AIDS and hematological cancer, 15.10 and 4.65, respectively; both P = .001), mycobacterial infections (AIDS; P = .006), and viral infections other than influenza (hematological cancer, 5.49; P < .001).",

This variability among continents and countries is probably attributable to different healthcare systems and rates of hospitalization of immunocompromised patients. Our analysis showed that the most frequent risk factor for immunocompromise is the chronic use of systemic steroids. Aging of the population and therapeutic advancements have favored the increased burden of chronic diseases and long-term therapies with immunosuppressive agents [8, 9] . In particular, steroids are the agents most frequently prescribed, for their wide spectrum of efficacy in several diseases [13, 17, 19] . Therefore, many patients presenting to the emergency room with pneumonia are receiving chronic steroid treatment. No data are available on this population group, and further studies are needed to characterize these patients and provide individualized management.",

Moreover, neutropenic patients are well represented and mainly affected also by hematological cancer or under treatment with chemotherapy. Our results suggest that patients may have >1 risk factor characteristic and clinical assessment should be comprehensive, taking into consideration risk factors for immunocompromise and their associated biological mechanisms. In contrast, AIDS, lung transplantation, asplenia, and aplastic anemia seem to be less frequent at admission and to represent distinct clinical entities. Findings of previous studies seem to be in line with our results, with AIDS patients considered as a distinct patient population and with very few observational studies available on asplenia and aplastic anemia [21, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] In agreement with previous reports, S. pneumoniae is the leading microorganism in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent groups [32, 33] . Among pathogens covered by standard CAP therapy, only P. aeruginosa was more frequently isolated in immunocompromised compared with immunocompetent patients. These findings differ from microbiological results of previous studies. Gram-positive bacteria, especially S. aureus, were more frequently identified in patients with immunocompromise of different causes [22, 30, 34] . Only Li and coauthors [13] found patients with immunological disorders, treated with systemic steroids and cytotoxic agents, to have a higher incidence of infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, mainly P. aeruginosa. This similarity with our findings could be explained by the prevalence of patients exposed to chronic steroids in our cohort.",

The majority of studies have focused on bacteremia in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with prevalences varying from 6% to 44% depending on the type of bacteria and host-related factors [41] [42] [43] . Few studies addressed this topic in kidney transplant recipients, reporting a prevalence of bacteremia ranging from 25% to 69% [44, 45] . Finally, few studies have addressed HIV and bacteremia, with prevalences ranging from 10% to 25%, depending on the pathogen and grade of immunosuppression [46, 47] . The prevalence of bacteremia in our study was 5T-6% in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Differences in the prevalence of bacteremia are due mainly to differences between the risk factors for immunocompromise in our study (chronic steroid use, hematological cancer, and chemotherapy) and those previously reported in the literature.",

First of all, to our knowledge, this is the first study showing a worldwide perspective on immunocompromise among patients coming from the community with pneumonia, with a large and diverse sample of patients enrolled across different countries in 6 continents. However, we were not able to involve many investigators from Asia and Africa, and most cases occurred in North America and Europe, thus limiting the generalizability of our findings. Another major limitation is the unfeasibility of grading the severity of immunocompromise and, therefore, stratifying patients and defining the physiopathological interaction between different risk factors, especially with regard to the use of biological drugs and chronic steroids. Furthermore, potentially important risk factors for an immunocompromised state, such as solid organ transplants other than lung, have not been specifically investigated. Finally, no outcome data have been collected, and this strongly limits our speculations as to the correct empiric antibiotic therapy for use in immunocompromised patients with CAP.",

At multivariable analysis, M. tuberculosis was independently associated with malnutrition only (OR, 5.14; 95% CI, 2.21-11.93; P < .001).
