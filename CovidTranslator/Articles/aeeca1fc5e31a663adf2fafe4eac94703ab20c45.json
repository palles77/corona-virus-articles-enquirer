Five copies of early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) binding elements were identified in the intron of HSV-1 ICP22 (infected cell protein No. 22) gene, leading to the hypothesis that Egr-1 binds to the viral genome and regulates the viral gene expression. Transient co-transfection assays indicated that Egr-1 negatively regulated the transcription of both full-length and intron-removed ICP22 promoters. The same assays also revealed that Egr-1 repressed ICP4 (infected cell protein No. 4) promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner but showed less inhibition when the intron was removed. Histone deacetylation was not involved in this regulation since histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A did not exhibit any effect on Egr-1-mediated repression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Egr-1 reduced the binding of Sp1 to the promoters and that the co-repressor Nab2 (NGFI-A/EGR1-binding protein) was recruited to the proximity of ICP4 in the presence of Egr-1. These results suggested that the multifunctional transcription factor Egr-1 can repress HSV-1 immediate-early gene expression through the recruitment of co-repressor Nab2 and reduction of Sp1 occupancy, and thus may play a critical role in HSV-1 gene silencing during latency.",

            "text": "We hypothesized that Egr-1 can regulate the transcription of ICP22 and ICP4 (infected cell protein No. 4). To test the hypothesis, nucleosomal-associated episomal plasmids were constructed, containing full-length ICP4 or ICP22 (pICP4 or pICP22) promoters as well as intron-deleted promoters (pICP22-ID or pICP4-ID) ( Figure 1 ). Our cotransfection experiments showed that Egr-1 repressed the activity of both ICP22 and ICP4 promoters. However, the results from intron-deleted mutant promoters indicated that the Egr-1-mediated inhibition was reduced in ICP4-ID, but not in ICP22-ID. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) failed to reverse Egr-1 mediated inhibition, suggesting that histone deacetylation is not involved in the regulation. Finally, our chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that the co-repressor Nab2 (NGFI-A/EGR1-binding protein) was recruited to the proximity of ICP4 promoter, and that the occupancy of Sp-1 was reduced in the presence of Egr-1. These results raise the possibility that Egr-1 plays roles in regulating HSV-1 gene expression and controls viral latency and reactivation.",

            "text": "The episomal vector pREP-SEAP is based on the vector pREP-7 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the removal of RSV promoter and the introduction of reporter gene SEAP. In short, the RSV promoter was removed from pREP-7 by digestion with XbaI and PvuII. A 0.3-kb XbaI-PvuII fragment from pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen) containing the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal was ligated to the XbaI-PvuII vector fragment of pREP-7 to block the expression from cryptic upstream promoters. This plasmid was designated pREP-bghpA. The gene encoding a secreted form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) was excised from pSEAP2-Basic (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) by digesting the plasmid with NotI and SalI and ligating the 2.0 kb fragment containing the gene into NotI-and SalI-digested pREP-bghpA to form pREP-SEAP. To construct HSV-1 promoter plasmids, DNA fragments containing the ICP4 and ICP22 promoter/leader region were amplified by PCR and cloned in pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). The plasmid pAA3, containing the ICP4 and ICP22 genes, was used as a template. PCR was performed using primer 8834 (5\u2032-GGT ACC CCA GAA AAC GTC CCG GAG-3\u2032) and primer ICP4B5 (5\u2032-GGT ACC CGA GCG TCT GAC GGT CTG TCT C-3\u2032) at 55 \u00b0C. The 1208 bp PCR fragment, containing the regulatory sequence of ICP22 and ICP4 promoters with opposite orientation, was inserted into the KpnI site of the pREP-SEAP. As a result, there are two types of reporter plasmids. The resulting plasmid with SEAP driven by ICP22 was named pICP22. The pICP4 contains SEAP, which is driven by the ICP4 promoter ( Figure 1 ). To construct the intron-deleted mutant promoter, primer 9104 (5\u2032-GAC GTT CCC CCG TGC AAA AAA GGC GG-3\u2032) and primer ICP4 B5 were used. The resulting plasmid with SEAP driven by ICP22 promoter without intron was named as pICP22-ID. The pICP4-ID has SEAP reporter driven by the intron-less ICP4 promoter. The map of plasmids is summarized in Figure 1 . The Egr-1 expression vector pJDM948 was a generous gift provided by Dr Jeffery Milbrandt at Washington University in St Louis, MO, USA. The plasmid pH4-2, based on pUC19, contains the Hind III restriction fragment (non-prototype structure) covering the entire long and short internal repeats. This plasmid contains the genes of ICP4, ICP0, and LAT (latency-associated transcripts). Plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used as a control for transfection.",

The authors also showed that Egr-2, but not Egr-1 and -3, inhibited the transcription of HSV-1 LAT, which represents the only major transcript during latency. These studies suggested that EGR proteins are involved during the reactivation from latency. However, the effect of Egr-1 on HSV-1 IE genes was not shown. The present study indicates that Egr-1 negatively regulates ICP4 and ICP22 transcription, and thus may have a role in the establishment of latency. It is likely that Egr-1, but not other EGR proteins, exert negative effect on these promoters upon infection to cause viral gene silencing. It is also possible that the use of our model system, which involves circular plasmids associated with chromatin, may have contributed to uncovering this novel regulatory mechanism.",

These results prompted us to hypothesize that Nab2 may participate in the Egr-1-mediated repression of HSV-1 IE genes. Results shown here suggest that Nab2 was recruited to the IE promoters in the presence of Egr-1. Although the intron is located closer to the transcription initiation site of ICP22 promoter than the ICP4 promoter, Egr-1 induced a greater repressive effect on ICP4 transcription.

Overall, these results indicated that Egr-1 can modulate the binding of Sp1 to HSV-1 promoter and the repression of ICP4 and ICP22 expression may be in part owing to the dislocation of Sp1 and TBP. These results suggest a two-step mechanism for Egr-1 mediated regulation (Figure 7) . First, the binding of Egr-1 to the Sp-1 sites reduced the binding of Sp-1 to its genuine elements and caused a reduction in transcription, presumably by diminishing the action of TBP and the assembly of polymerase complexes.
