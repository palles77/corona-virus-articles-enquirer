ICU 115 beds are, by far, the most pressing need. The supply of hospital beds is likely to face shortages 116 after April 21 and of mechanical ventilators just a few days afterward. The two scenarios for ICU 117 admission (5% and 12% of the total cases) resulted in about 4-6 days difference. With a 12% 118 assumption, Bras\u00edlia would face a shortage of ICU beds by the end of March. Making 50% of 119 usual occupancy dedicated to COVID-19 postpones shortages for less than a week, and placing 120 all resources under state control shifts the capacity threshold by up to one week for hospital beds 121 and mechanical ventilators, and by up to four days for ICU beds.

Given the significant uncertainty in parameter estimates at this phase of the epidemic and 171 the simplifying assumptions of an exponential model, results from our simulated scenarios 172 should not be used as precise estimates for the exact timing and extent of capacity thresholds 173 being reached. Instead, they aim to inform planning and prompt response and do send three 174 important messages. 175 First, the epidemic of COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate existing inequalities if those that solely 176 rely on the SUS are hit the hardest. In communities with high population density and poor 177 infrastructure, it is unfeasible to practice social isolation. In those areas, the transmission is likely 178 to occur fast and the population mostly relies only on the SUS, quickly overwhelming the health 179 system. One alternative to alleviate the is to temporarily put all private hospitals under the 180 control of the state, a measure adopted by Spain. 26 Yet, our results show that this would postpone 181 shortages by about a week.
