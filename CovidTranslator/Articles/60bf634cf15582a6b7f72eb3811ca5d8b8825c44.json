Conditions were optimized for resolution and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites of LA, one of which has not been reported previously as a metabolite of LA in mammalian microsomal incubations. These products, 12-(w)-hydroxy-LA, 1 1-(w-1)-hydroxy-LA, and a novel metabolite, IO-(o-2)-hydroxy-LA, were isolated by HPLC and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In the presence of NADPH, the formation of all three metabolites was linear with time and microsomal protein concentration. Hydrogen peroxide also supported the microsomal metabolism of LA, although the ratio of metabolites was substantially different than that produced by NADPH-supported microsomes. Several biochemical probes (metyrapone, a-naphthoflavone, 2diethylaminoethyl-2,2diphenylvalerate hydrochloride, and lo-undecynoic acid) were used to dissociate the three LA hydroxylase activities. These experiments suggest that the site-specific hydroxylation [w-, (w-l)-, (w-2)-] of LA may be catalyzed by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450.",

However, many of these techniques did not provide sufficient resolution for quantitation of the individual w-and (w-l)-hydroxylated metabolites of LA (8, 12) . One of the most popular methods for quantitation of LA and its metabolites involves HPLC separation and radiochemical quantitation of the methyl esters of LA and its hydroxylated metabolites (13) . This procedure has numerous steps and is therefore time consuming and subject to variability. Two groups have recently reported a simplified procedure for the quantitation of microsomal LA hydroxylation ( 11, 14) .

Therefore, quantitation of the individual metabolites of LA could be used for the characterization of a different isozyme(s) of cytochrome P-450. Studies by Kupfer and co-workers indicate that, in addition to hydroxylation at the w and (w-l) positions, hepatic microsomes also catalyze the hydroxylation of PGE, and PGEz at the (w-2) position ( 15, 16) . Therefore, it is feasible that other lipids such as LA could also be hydroxylated at the (o-2) position by microsomal incubations. In this paper, we describe a technique which allows rapid separation and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites [w-, (w-1 )-, and (o-2)-hydroxy] of LA. Furthermore, we describe an initial biochemical characterization of the three microsomal LA hydroxylases. St. Louis, MO) and water were available ad libitum.

However, certain glucose 6-phosphate regenerating systems (Sigma) resulted in substantially less microsomal metabolism of LA when compared to the metabolism supported by NADPH alone (Table 2 ). This inhibition of LA hydroxylases was due to an inhibitor present in the glucose 6-phosphate.

Preincubation of microsomes for periods up to 1 h resulted in a small (lo-20%) increase in all LA hydroxylase activities when compared to nonpreincubated controls. This increase in hydroxylase activities is unexplained but may reflect metabolism, during the preincubation period, of lipids which are released from the microsomal membrane and inhibit LA hydroxylases. Rat liver microsomes contain 2-2.5 nmol of free fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated, per milligram of microsomal protein (19, 20) . As postulated by Kupfer and others, the amounts and ratios of these fatty acids may affect cytochrome P-450-dependent activities such as LA hydroxylases (2 1). Preincubation of microsomes with UDYA resulted in a time-dependent loss of LA W-, (w-l)-, and (w-2)-hydroxylase activities (Fig.  7A ). Nearly 50% of LA w-hydroxylase activity was inactivated by 50 I.IM UDYA. However, a much smaller percentage (20-30%) of LA (w-l)-and (w-2)-hydroxylases were destroyed under similar preincubation conditions. This preferential inactivation of LA whydroxylases was observed over a large concentration range of UDYA (Fig. 7B) . This differential inactivation of LA hydroxylases was not observed when a nonspecific suicide substrate for cytochrome P-450, l-aminobenzotriazole ( 12) , was preincubated with hepatic microsomes; approximately 70% of all three LA hydroxylase activities was lost following a 30-min preincubation with 100 PM 1 -aminobenzotriazole (data not shown).",

This suggests that the w-hydroxylation of LA was supported by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450 than those which support the (o-l)-and (o-2)-hydroxylations of LA.
