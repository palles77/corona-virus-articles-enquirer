Accumulating evidence shows that ACE2 provides protective effects in peripheral tissues and has great potential for the treatment of RAS-related diseases. The role of ACE2 in the central nervous system is not well established. However, in recent years, much more progress has been made on the studies of this carboxypeptidase in the central regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular function in general. It has been shown that brain ACE2 interacts with the other components of the RAS (ACE, angiotensin II, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor), protects baroreflex and autonomic function, stimulates nitric oxide release, reduces oxidative stress, and prevents the development of or attenuates hypertension. These data support the critical role of ACE2 in the central regulation of cardiovascular function. This review summarizes recently published data on the central effects of ACE2 in the regulation of cardiovascular function.",

Ang I is then converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) into the octapeptide Ang II. Ang II is one of the major players in the RAS, acting on various receptors such as Ang II type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 receptors (AT2R). By binding to AT1R, Ang II promotes vasoconstriction, cell proliferation, and fibrosis, whereas when binding to AT2R it promotes the inhibition of cell growth. Most of the effects of Ang II have been shown to be mediated by AT1R. Increased activity of the RAS is associated with various cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure. Classical treatment of RAS-associated diseases focuses on the blockade of Ang II formation or effects through the use of ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers [1] .",

However, the distribution of the new element ACE2 in the brain was at first controversial because original reports failed to identify the carboxypeptidase in this tissue [2, 3] . A few years later, ACE2 mRNA and protein were found in the brain by our group and others [9] [10] [11] . Using a selective antibody, we reported that ACE2 is widespread throughout the mouse brain, present in nuclei involved in the central regulation of cardiovascular function such as the subfornical organ, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), as well as in noncardiovascular areas such as the motor cortex and raphe (Fig. 1 ). Shortly after our observation, Lin et al. [12\u2022] confirmed the presence of ACE2 mRNA and protein in the mouse brainstem and reported the interaction between ACE2 and AT1R in this region.

It has been shown that upregulated AGT, ACE, Ang II, and AT1R in the brain are involved in the development and maintenance of hypertension and heart failure [7, 14] . Similar to the observations in the periphery, Ang-(1-7) shows opposite properties to Ang II in the central nervous system, serving as an important neuromodulator in the central control of cardiovascular function. It has been well demonstrated that central Ang-(1-7) increases cardiac baroreflex sensitivity [15, 16] , reduces norepinephrine release [17] and decreases blood pressure [18, 19] in hypertensive rats. The depressor effects of Ang-(1-7) in the brain have also been shown to be mediated by increase in bradykinin levels [20] , potentiating the hypotensive effects of bradykinin [21] and stimulating nitric oxide (NO) release [22] . ACE2 provides an important route for the metabolism of Ang II and, as the principal forming enzyme for Ang-(1-7), shifts the balance between the two biological active peptides.",

In vivo, our group showed that overexpression of ACE2 in the mouse brain not only reduces AT1R expression as previously suggested [30] but also increases Mas and AT2R [33\u2022\u2022], whereas blockade of AT1R increases brain ACE2 activity in hypertensive mice [31\u2022\u2022]. Using a gene-silencing approach, Lin et al. [12\u2022] reported that downregulation of AT1R mRNA is associated with downregulation of ACE2 mRNA in the mouse brainstem. In addition, downregulated ACE2 is accompanied by upregulation of ACE levels in the brain of a heart failure animal model [34] and in multiple sclerosis patients [35], indicating a special link between ACE2 and ACE in the brain. These data confirmed and extend previous findings that ACE2 interacts with other RAS components in the brain and strengthens the concept that ACE2 is a significant player in the brain RAS.",

In additional experiments, the syn-hACE2 mice were bred with chronically hypertensive transgenic mice expressing both human renin and AGT genes [37], to generate a triple-transgenic model (SARA) with elevated Ang II throughout the body and overexpression of human ACE2 selectively in the brain. Following chronic measurement of blood pressure in SARA mice, we observed that central overexpression of ACE2 significantly decreases baseline blood pressure in these chronically hypertensive mice [31\u2022\u2022].

Similarly, we previously showed that ACE2 gene deletion on a C57bl/6 background mouse resulted in impairment of the spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (SBRS), increased sympathetic tone, and decreased parasympathetic tone [40, 41] . Moreover, exercise training-induced increase in endogenous ACE2 in the brain of CHF rabbits was associated with an attenuation of sympathetic nerve activity in these animals [34] . Also, overexpressing ACE2 in the PVN, by virus-mediated gene transfer, improves renal sympathetic nerve activity in coronary ligation-induced CHF rats [42] . Global overexpression of ACE2 in the brain also restored the impaired SBRS, normalized the increased sympathetic tone, and decreased parasympathetic tone in transgenic hypertensive mice, contributing to the attenuation of hypertension in these animals [31\u2022\u2022]. In low-dose Ang II infusion, a model of neurogenic hypertension, although ACE2 overexpression in the brain did not alter the increased sympathetic tone, it significantly prevented the decrease in both SBRS and parasympathetic tone and attenuated the development of hypertension [33\u2022\u2022]. Similar observations were made by Gao et al.

            "text": "In the central nervous system, it has been shown that NO reduces, whereas oxidative stress increases, sympathetic activity [45] [46] [47] . Overexpressing ACE2 in the PVN normalized the decreased neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) protein levels in this region in CHF rats and was accompanied with improved sympathetic nerve activity, suggesting the inhibitory effects of ACE2 on sympathoexcitation involve an NO mechanism [42] . Similarly, Gao et al. [43] showed that overexpression of ACE2 in the brain prevented the downregulation of NOS expression in the CHF mice, contributing to the improvement of baroreflex sensitivity and the reduction of sympathoexcitation. This is confirmed by our observation showing that overexpression of ACE2 in the brain upregulated NOS expression and increased NO levels in the cerebrospinal fluid [33\u2022 \u2022]. In addition, ACE2 overexpression in the brain prevented the Ang II-mediated decrease in NOS expression in regions modulating blood pressure regulation [33\u2022\u2022]. Furthermore, we observed that ACE2 gene deletion leads to increased superoxide levels in various brain nuclei of aged mice [48] , supporting the antioxidant capacity of ACE2 in the brain. These data indicate that the protective effects of ACE2 could be linked to an increased NO availability and decreased oxidative stress in the brain.",

The many beneficial effects of this carboxypeptidase on the central regulation of cardiovascular function could be independent or at least partially result from the modification of angiotensin peptides. The potential therapeutic implications of ACE2 suggest that it could be used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases. Increasing brain ACE2 by stimulating endogenous ACE2 activity and/or expression, or administration of exogenous ACE2 may provide beneficial effects in some pathologic conditions and this could be a new strategy for future development of novel therapeutic agents. Further understanding of its role in the central nervous system is needed because it would lead to the exploration of novel therapies for neurogenic hypertension and other cardiovascular as well as neurologic diseases.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 overexpression in the subfornical organ prevents the angiotensin II-mediated pressor and drinking responses and is associated with angiotensin II type 1 receptor downregulation.

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor mediated reduction of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 activity in the brain impairs baroreflex function in hypertensive mice. Hypertension. 2009; 53:210-216. Using a chronically hypertensive model and a triple-transgenic model with chronic overexpression of Ang II and brain ACE2, the authors found that AT1R exerts an inhibitory effect on ACE2 activity in the brain of hypertensive mice, and that brain selective overexpression of ACE2 attenuated the hypertension by improving arterial baroreflex and autonomic function.

Circ Res. 2010 in press. Using a new transgenic mouse model (syn-hACE2) with neuron-targeted ACE2 overexpression, the investigators demonstrated that ACE2 overexpression attenuates the development of Ang IIinduced hypertension by preventing the decrease in baroreflex sensitivity and parasympathetic tone. In addition, these protective effects could be mediated by increased NO availability in the brain, likely resulting from Mas and AT2R upregulation. 34. Kar S, Gao L, Zucker IH.
