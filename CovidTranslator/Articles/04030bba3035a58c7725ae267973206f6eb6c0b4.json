Using mNGS as the reference, PCR-and CRISPR-nCoV both had a specificity of 238 100% in our study. PCR-nCoV was able to detect the virus in 90.4% (47/52) of the positive 239 cases, with Ct's ranging from 28.8 to 40.4 and a median Ct of 35.8. It worth noting that the 5 240 false negative samples by PCR-nCoV had a median mNGS read number of 550, which is 241 much lower than that of the other positive samples at 2,381 reads, suggesting a lower titer of 242 the virus in these samples. CRISPR showed a greater sensitivity by detecting all 52 243 nCoV-confirmed cases (100%), with FC values ranging from 5.0 to 66.3 and a median FC of 244 22.8 (Figure 4A). 245 When the reaction turn-around time (TAT) is compared, the CRISPR-nCoV reaction 246 requires only 40 minutes, which is the least among the three and includes 30 minutes of DNA 247 amplification and 10 minutes of Cas reaction. PCR-nCoV requires about 1.5 hours for a 248 completion run of the PCR program. mNGS takes approximately 20 hours, which includes 8 249 hours of library preparation, 10 hours of sequencing and 2 hours of bioinformatic analysis. 250 Because a positive result may be determined before completing the PCR program, we 251 calculated the effective TAT as the time when the florescent signal reached the threshold. As 252 showed in Figure 4B, CRISPR-nCoV presented a significant advantage in effective TAT over 253 PCR and mNGS. 254 Altogether, we demonstrated a CRISPR-based assay for 2019-nCoV that offered shorter 255 turn-around time and great diagnostic value, even in under-resourced settings without the 256 need of thermal cyclers.

An RT-PCR assay 272 for 2019-nCoV is faster and more affordable. Nevertheless, the need for a thermo cycler by 273 PCR-based diagnostics hinders its use in low-resource settings and curbs the assay 274 throughput. Besides their lower demand for sophisticated temperature controlling instruments, 275isothermal molecular methods are advantageous owing to its faster nucleic acid amplification.",
