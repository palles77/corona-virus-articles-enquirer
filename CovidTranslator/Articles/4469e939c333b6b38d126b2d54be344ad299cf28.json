            "text": "Trypanosoma cruzi is a flagellated protozoan belonging to the Trypanosomatidae family, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease. Currently, there is neither a licensed vaccine nor effective treatment, characterizing an unmet clinical need. The IgY refers to the egg yolk immunoglobulin (Y = yolk) and its production and use are subjects of many studies due to the diversity of its diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Several researchers have shown that the use of specific IgY may prevent and/or control infectious and parasitic diseases. Based on these evidences, the aim of this study was to immunize chickens with trypomastigotes of T. cruzi in order to produce highly effective and pure antibodies (IgY), as well as extract, characterize, quantify, and verify cytotoxic effects of IgY anti-T. cruzi. After the induction of IgY production by chickens, the eggs were collected and the IgY was extracted by method of precipitation of polyethylene glycol 6000. The IgY anti-T. cruzi characterization was performed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), western-blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, the cytotoxic or proliferative effects of IgY anti-T. cruzi was verified by MTT assay. The concentration of IgY in yolk was 8.41 \u00b1 1.47 mg/mL. The characterization of IgY reveled bands of stained peptides with molecular weight between 75 and 50 kDa and 37 and 25 kDa. In the ELISA test was observed that there was antigen-antibody reaction throughout the sample period. The concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 mg/mL of IgY anti-T. cruzi presented no cytotoxic of proliferative effects in mononuclear and VERO cells in vitro. The results indicated that T. cruzi is able to generate a high production of specific immunoglobulins in chickens, it did not cause damage to the cell membrane and no proliferative effect.",

This disease constitutes a serious worldwide public health issue (Coura and Dias, 2009) , that causes a chronic parasitic condition characterized by a life-long infection of the host (Martin et al., 2015) . Clinically, this disease may have an acute phase that lasts for 1 to 4 months characterized by patent parasitemia, and a chronic phase with a life-long phase including a subpatent parasitemia and tissue parasitism (Dias, 1997; Rassi et al., 2010) . The diagnosis of T. cruzi infection during the acute phase is carried out by the direct detection of circulating parasites. However, during the chronic phase, the diagnosis is performed by conventional serologic assays (WHO, 2002; Otani et al., 2009; Carlier and Torrico, 2003) .",

However, the treatment with benzimidazole has many side effects, prolonged treatment time, and low and variable efficacy in the chronic phase of this infection, which is the most prevalent form of the disease (Urbina and Docampo, 2003; Viotti et al., 2009 ). Thus, the search for more effective medications with less adverse effects is one of the main focuses of many studies (Coura, 2007) . In this context, the search for alternative models for the treatment and diagnosis of T. cruzi is essential, mainly because it is a disease considered neglected. Specific antibodies for immunotherapy against this parasite might be a therapeutic alternative in controlling and/or prevention infections. Immunoglobulin Y (IgY) are polyclonal antibodies obtained from egg yolk (yolk = y) of immunized chickens. Such molecules have high specificity for binding and inactivating foreign substances, such as antigenic molecules that are able to invade the body (Karlsson et al., 2004) . For this reason, IgY has been used for diagnosis and therapy (Reilly et al., 1997) .",

This difference might be related to the immunization protocol, since we used only 10 days of intervals. Moreover, this difference may occur due a greater immune response mounted by the chickens opposite to the antigenic epitopes of T. cruzi antigenic epitopes that may be more complex than T. evansi. In addition, regarding the ELISA results, higher optical densities were observed up to 8 weeks, coinciding with the inoculation of a greater number of trypomastigotes (2.4 \u00d7 10 4 trypomastigotes/mL), which shows that the antigen concentration is closely related to the specific production of IgY. Furthermore, there was a major reduction of IgY activity, and this can be due to a reduction in the immune responses of the animals against the antigen, since after several inoculations this antigen cannot be seen as a challenge anymore. 150, 100, 75, 50, 37, 25 and 20 kDa) .

Specific chicken antibodies have been successfully used against a wide variety of antigens (Munhoz et al., 2014) . Various authors reported the efficiency, sensitivity, and specificity of diagnostic tests using IgY from various microorganisms such as Toxoplasma gondii, Schistosoma japonicum, Trichinella spiralis and coronavirus (Ferreira J\u00fanior et al., 2012; Cai et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Palaniyappan et al., 2012) . The results of our experiment regarding IgY anti-T. cruzi indicate that this antibody could not be used in a diagnostic test, since it showed cross-reactivity with antigens of T. evansi. But on the other hand, this finding leaves the possibility that IgY could be used as immunotherapy against many trypanosomes.",

The samples tested were IgY extracted at different weeks after immunization (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13) at different concentrations (1:1000, 1:2000 and 1:5000).

Our results are similar to those found by Sampaio et al. (2014a) , using IgY anti-T. evansi against PBMC cells on concentrations of 1, 5 and 10 mg/mL, other important blood protozoan belonging to the Trypanosomatidae family.
