The serum levels of DcR3 and its TNF-like ligand TL1A and homologous decoy receptor OPG were quantified by ELISA. The values of DcR3 to diagnose sepsis were analyzed by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results showed that DcR3 was significantly elevated in sepsis compared to SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), a condition similar to sepsis but resulting from noninfectious insults. DcR3 showed superior area under the ROC curve (AUC, 0.958) compared to poor AUCs of TL1A and OPG. At a cut-off of 3.24 ng/ml, DcR3 predicted sepsis from SIRS with 96% sensitivity and 82.6% specificity. DcR3 also predicted sepsis from cancer and inflammatory bowel disease with equally excellent values. Therefore, DcR3 serum level has the potential to serve as a reliable biomarker of sepsis.",

            "text": "Sepsis is a life-threatening disease resulting from the failure of our immune system to mount proper defense against invading pathogens. It is initiated by the binding of pathogen antigens to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed in immune cells that in turn results in the induction of various cytokines (Decker, 2004) . These cytokines then mediate numerous molecular and cellular activities that can lead to dysregulated immune responses. The clinical symptoms begin with systemic inflammatory responses and rapidly progress to multiple organ failure and ultimately death. Despite the availability of a broad spectrum of antibiotics and intensive supportive care, hospital mortality ranges from 30% ~50% for severe sepsis and septic shock (Angus et al., 2001) . The problem of effectively treating patients with sepsis is in part attributed to the difficulty of accurately diagnosing sepsis especially in its early stages. Also, incomplete understanding of the complexity of sepsis pathogenesis has hampered the invention of highly effective therapeutic strategies. Therefore, the discovery of a novel protein that possesses the potential to serve as a reliable biomarker of sepsis and to provide further insights into the mechanisms of sepsis development and progression is of significance.",

            "text": "Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) belongs to the decoy receptor family of the tumor necrosis factor receptor super family (TNFRSF) that also includes DcR1, DcR2, and osteoprotegrin (OPG). DcR3 has the closest protein sequence identity with OPG and the two proteins are the only receptors exclusively secreted as soluble receptors among the TNFRSF members. So far, three TNF family cytokines (ligands) namely FasL (Pitti et al., 1998) , LIGHT (Yu et al., 1999) , and TL1A (Migone et al., 2002) were identified to interact with DcR3. Once bound to DcR3, these ligands cannot bind to their cell surface-bound receptors. FasL and TL1A bind to Fas and DR3 (death receptor 3), respectively ([Pitti et al., 1998 ] and [Migone et al., 2002] ). LIGHT binds to both LT-\u03b2R (lymphotoxin-beta receptor) and HVEM (herpesvirus entry mediator) (Zhai et al., 1998) . Like TNF, these three ligands belong to the type II transmembrane protein family that are first expressed as membrane-bound proteins and then cleaved off from the membrane. Both membrane-bound and soluble forms of these ligands are functional. As such, DcR3 was thought to modulate multifaceted immune responses that are mediated by the interaction between these three ligands and their cognate receptors.",

The selective DcR3 expression was primarily due to the preferential expression of TLR receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2/4) in APCs. Increased DcR3 levels were also detected in various human intestinal epithelial cell lines after LPS stimulation and the increase was via TLR4 activation that led to the activation of transcriptional factor NF-\u03baB .

The SIRS group was purposely included as the negative control of sepsis. As the clinical signs between sepsis and SIRS of noninfectious causes are similar and the diagnosis of sepsis has to be confirmed by pathogen detection, it will be most useful for DcR3 to rapidly differentiate sepsis from noninfectious SIRS in ICUs. The majority of pathogens detected in the sepsis group were Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and there were two cases of fungi. The average ages of sepsis and SIRS patients were 65 (age 41~97) and 45 (age 18~84), respectively. The twenty year age difference between the two groups was significant (P = 0.0016) and this difference seemed to accurately reflect the widely known fact that sepsis is more common in the elderly and immunocompromised people. The average WBC counts of sepsis (16,792 cells/\u00b5l) and SIRS (16,857 cells/\u00b5l) were higher than the reference range of 4,000~12,000 cells/\u00b5l but there was no difference in the cell counts between the two groups. There was significant correlation between DcR3 level and age (p = 0.0036) while no significance was found between DcR3 level and WBC (p = 0.4336). As scores for the severity of disease such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACH II) were not obtained for this study, no correlation between DcR3 and the severity of disease was performed.",

However, confirmation of pathogens by cultures is slow and it often yields false negative results (Klouche and Schr\u00f6der, 2008) . Although biomarkers cannot determine a particular pathogen like blood cultures, they can serve as rapid and inexpensive tools to discriminate sepsis from SIRS resulting from noninfectious insults in clinics. SIRS is nonspecific and can be caused by trauma, ischemia, inflammation, infection, or a combination of various insults. As antibiotics are ineffective for patients with SIRS, the differentiation between sepsis and SIRS of noninfectious causes especially in early stages of sepsis will help to reduce current practices of cautionary use of antibiotics on suspected patients. With the emergence of antibiotics-resistant bacteria, this has also become a pressing issue lately. Furthermore, sepsis progresses rapidly from systemic inflammatory responses to multiple organ dysfunction and septic shock and in these stages, antibiotics alone are ineffective to treat patients with severely dysregulated immune system resulting from the induction of numerous molecules upon the activation of TLRs by pathogens.",

Moreover, the regulation of DcR3 expression in response to bacterial antigens is under the control of TLRs that are known to play a key role in the innate immune system. As we reported, monocytes/macrophages and mDC (myeloid-derived dendritic cells) selectively responded to bacterial antigens such as LPS and LTA to induce DcR3 . LTA and LPS mediate signaling preferentially via TLR2 and TLR4, respectively. Fungal antigens are also recognized by TLR2/4 (Calich et al., 2008) . In contrast to mDC, pDC (plasmacytoid-derived dendritic cells) did not induce DcR3 release after LPS or LTA stimulation primarily due to the absence of TLR2/4 expression in pDC. Besides, pDC which expresses TLR7/9 did not induce DcR3 release even in response to the specific ligands of TLR7/9 while it released large amounts of IFN-\u03b1 in culture supernatant. The TLR7/9 ligands were single-stranded RNA, a common feature of viral genome and CpG-DNA motif, respectively. This preferential regulation of DcR3 expression via TLR2/4 but not TLR7 might be one of the reasons that systemic acute viral inflammatory symptoms showed lack of DcR3 elevations.",

It was reported that one out of 31 SARS patients had recovered on antibacterial treatment alone (So et al., 2003) . Antibiotics rarely work for SARS which is caused by a virulent coronavirus. The high DcR3 serum level in one SARS case in our study might have been also due to secondary bacterial infection in the lung. This indicated that DcR3 serum level might be useful to distinguish between viral and bacterial acute systemic infection in emergency situations when causative agents are unknown. Besides, it has been already shown that DcR3 plasma level was significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from the first day of admission and that high DcR3 level predicted the 28-day mortality independently of APACH II scores (Chen et al., 2009) . This study only included ARDS of bacterial origin (mostly bacterial pneumonia) and thus the authors indicated that DcR3 may be a prognosticator for patients with ARDS with an infectious etiology.

It suppresses HLA-DR (Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR) surface expression on dendritic cells and macrophages as well as phagocytic activity of macrophages (Chang et al., 2004) . DcR3 skews the Th1/Th2 (CD4+ helper T (Th) cell type 1 and 2) balance toward Th2 (immunosuppressive phenotype) responses (Hsu et al., 2002) .

Clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytic cells plays a significant role in the resolution of inflammation (Devitt and Marshall, 2011) .

With its potent immunomodulatory function in the immune system, DcR3 level may prove to be a clinically important indicator of sepsis development and progression. The results thus warrant further validation of the clinical value of DcR3 as a biomarker of sepsis. Comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for DcR3, OPG, and TL1A in predicting sepsis from SIRS. Areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for DcR3, OPG, and TL1A were 0.958 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.857 ~ 0.995), 0.578 (95% CI: 0.425 ~ 0.720) and 0.528 (95% CI: 0.377 ~ 0.675), respectively.
