Purity of the virus was confirmed by electrophoretie, ultracentrifugal, and electron microscopic procedures. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis tests revealed one precipitin line with normal mouse brain, three with purified virus, and four with crude virus when tested against anti-pure virus or anti-crude virus animal serums. The association of a host cell antigen with the virion was confirmed by standard HI and CF tests. of the bromelin-treatedvirus was 1.15 g/cm3 and of the intact OC 43 virion was 1.18 g/ems. By analytical ultracentrifugation the corrected sedimentation coefficient (~~0,~) of the OC 43 virion was determined to be 390 f 16 S, and the apparent molecular weight (MW,) was calculated to be 112 f 5 X 106daltons. INTRODUCTION Coronaviruses, a recently described group of human and animal viruses, resemble myxoviruses in size and structure, although various physical and host,-sensitivity characteristics set them apart. These factors have been thoroughly outlined in reviews by Estola (1970) and Bradburne and Tyrrell (1971) .",

Samples thus treated and containing 75-135 pg of protein were stabilized to lo-20% sucrose and applied to the gels. The gels were electrophoresed at 78-86 V and at 3.5 mA per tube at room temperature until a tracking dye, 0.05 % bromphenol blue, migrated to 1 mm from the distal end of the gel (about 60 min). The reservoir buffer in both chambers during electrophoresis was 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, with 0.1% SLS.",

The virus used throughout these studies was purified to a 5000-fold decrease in total protein, with a yield of he purity of the virus (at an HA titer of 1.3 X IOj) was confirmed by immunologic procedures, density gradient centrifugation, electron microscopy, and analytical procedures. Electron microscopy at low and high magnifications showed very clean fields of particles exhibit,ing the pleomorphism typical of this virus (Almeida and Tyrrell, 1967; Almeida and Waterson, 1970; Apostolov eE GEL, 1970; McIntosh et al., 1970; Bradburne and Tyrrell, 1971) . Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a sharp peak at 15,000 rpm with as little as 1.0 mg protein in the sample; this peak had the same sedimentation rate as one of several broad peaks observed when crude virus (at 2-4 mg protein/.4 ml) was sedimented under identical conditions.
