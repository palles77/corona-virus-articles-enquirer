            "text": "Background: In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in hundreds of infections and deaths globally. We aim to assess immunogenicity and protective efficacy of purified inactivated Vero-cell SARS vaccine in monkeys. Methods: The cultures of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) BJ-01 strain infected Vero cells were inactivated with \u2424-propiolactone. Sequential procedures, including ultrafiltration, gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, were performed to obtain purified inactivated SARS vaccine. The purified SARS vaccine was analyzed with electron microscope, HPLC and Western blotting. We immunized three groups of cynomolgus macaques fascicularis with adjuvant-containing purified vaccine, purified vaccine and unpurified vaccine, respectively, and a fourth group served as a control. Antibody titers were measured by plaque reduction neutralization test. The vaccinated monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV BJ-01 strain to observe protective efficacy. Additionally, three groups of rhesus monkeys were immunized with different doses of the purified inactivated SARS vaccine (0.5, 1 and 2 g/time/monkey) on days 0 and 7, and the monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV GZ-01 strain. We assessed the safety of the SARS vaccine and observed whether the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) occurred under low levels of neutralizing antibody in rhesus. Findings: The purity of SARS vaccine was 97.6% by HPLC identification and reacted with convalescent sera of SARS patients. The purified SARS vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies and prevented the replication of SARS-CoV in monkeys. Under low levels of neutralizing antibody, no exacerbation of clinical symptoms was observed when the immunized monkeys were challenged with SARS-CoV. In this preliminary animal trial, no side effects were detected when monkeys were immunized with purified SARS vaccine either at normal or large doses. Interpretation: The purified inactivated SARS vaccine could induce high levels of neutralizing antibody, and protect the monkeys from the challenge of SARS-CoV. The SARS vaccine prepared in the study appeared to be safe in monkeys.",

According to statistics released by WHO on 7 August 2003, a total of 8422 clinically diagnosed cases were reported worldwide, causing 916 deaths, an estimated mortality of 10.9%. A novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the pathogen of SARS [1] , In 2004, some new SARS cases were reported in China, which suggest that SARS may recure in the future. The current medical strategies mainly replying on non-specific anti-viral and supportive treatment are not sufficient. Previous experience in controlling infectious diseases indicates that the most efficient protection against SARS infection is mass immunization. Effective vaccines for protecting the population are urgently needed.",

Antibody levels also increased rapidly after the last boost over a 2-week observation period. The results showed that the neutralizing antibody levels in the adjuvant-containing purified vaccine group were higher and lasted longer than those in other two groups. The quantity of neutralizing antibody production and the time for antibody level maintenance showed no apparent differences between the purified vaccine group (without adjuvant) and unpurified vaccine group, but the antibody levels in the unpurified vaccine group appeared to decrease somewhat faster. The results showed that both the purified and the unpurified SARS vaccines can induce high levels of SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies in monkeys, thus demonstrating high immunogenicity.

In this study it was also demonstrated that the vaccination with adjuvant of aluminium could induce higher antibody production of SARS-CoV, but clinical safety concerns about possible side effects in humans precluded use of the adjuvantcontaining purified vaccine to evaluate immune protection (efficacy testing).
