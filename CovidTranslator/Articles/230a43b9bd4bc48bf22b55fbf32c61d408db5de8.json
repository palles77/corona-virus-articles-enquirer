            "text": "On the 31 st of December 2019, the World Health Organisation (WHO) was informed of a series of unknown pneumonia cases emerging in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. On the 7 th of January, 2020 the causative agent of these infections was identified as a novel coronavirus subsequently named SARS-CoV-2. This virus eventually spread to more than 180 different countries worldwide and in March 2020 the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. At the time of writing (22 nd March, 2020) SARS-CoV-2 has infected >274,000 people resulting in >11,000 deaths. 1 Large data analyses have shown that the elderly are particularly susceptible to severe forms of COVID-19 (the clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection). 2 However, disease severity and transmission amongst the paediatric population is less well defined. In an analysis of the 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China only 2\u00b71% were found to be in children (\u226419 years of age), 2 suggesting a reduced rate of infection in this age group. However, this observation remains controversial as others have suggested that the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children under ten (7\u00b74%) is similar to the population average (7\u00b79%). 3 The current consensus is that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are, on average, milder in children (although severe infections can still occur). [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Such observations are consistent with the lower incidence of severe disease amongst children following infection with other coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 9, 10 However, this lower incidence of clinical symptoms (and therefore lower incidence of detected disease) raises concerns that children could be an important source of SARS-CoV-2 in household transmission clusters. 8 retrieved and reviewed (available in either English or Chinese). Of these, 126 articles were excluded because i) they did not report paediatric infections ii) did not report sufficient individual case data and/or iii) did not report family clusters. Individual paediatric patient data was obtained from the reviewed studies and was only excluded if the individual was recorded as having leukaemia (n = 1) or if the blood panel data was descriptive, rather than numerical (e.g. 'elevated platelets') (n=10). The intra-household transmission clusters were also sourced from information provided by local health authority's news of China, Europe, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea when available. Any intra-household cluster identified in these local sources was included in the study.",

To exclude this possibility, we reanalysed the data looking at the number of families where an adult was identified as the index but one or more children were identified as asymptomatically infected ( Figure 1 ). However, even if we assume that all asymptomatic children in these families were in fact the index case, only 6/28 (21%) children were identified as the index case in the household cluster ( Table 2 ).

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Similarly findings have been made in children infected with either SARS or MERS. 9,10 At present, it remains unclear why children may develop less severe forms of COVID-19. It has been suggested that the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, may be expressed at a lower level in children than in adults. 16 Alternatively, these observations may reflect the fact that the paediatric immune system is more adept than that of adults at dealing with infections for which there is no pre-existing immunity. 58, 59 This is reflected in the comparatively mild infections experienced by children upon infection with measles virus and varicella zoster virus. 60, 61 Understanding age-dependent differences in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 remains a key priority for future research.",

Despite the near absence of children on the ship, 328 of the 634 infected individuals were asymptomatic. These data clearly indicate that asymptomatic infections are not limited to the paediatric population. Therefore, perhaps one of the most effective public health intervention strategies would be to identify and isolate asymptomatically infected adults, as it is these individuals who have numerous contacts outside the home and may be contributing to viral spread.",

Our analysis of household transmission clusters was also based on the assumption that the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 was approximately equivalent in children and adults. Whilst we did not observe any significant difference in the incubation time of infected children and their infected adult relatives (data not shown), others have suggested there might be a longer incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 in children 71 . It is also possible that the analysis performed herein was impaired by the policy within particular countries to only test contacts of a known COVID-19 patient when and if they become symptomatic. This could result in the number of asymptomatically infected individuals being underestimated. Importantly, China rapidly implemented a policy to test both symptomatic and non-symptomatic contacts, suggesting that this limitation would only apply to transmission clusters detected outside of China. Nevertheless, despite these important limitations, these data suggest that children are unlikely to be driving the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
