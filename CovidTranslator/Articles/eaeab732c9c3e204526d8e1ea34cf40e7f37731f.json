            "text": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of heart disease and heart failure in dogs. [1] [2] [3] [4] The traditional concept of the RAAS is as follows: cardiac disease, as well as treatments for cardiac disease, such as diuretics, decrease perfusion of the kidney, activating release of renin, which converts angiotensinogen to the 10-amino acid peptide, angiotensin I (AT1 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ). Subsequently, the dipeptidyl-carboxypeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), cleaves 2 amino acids from the C-terminus of AT1 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) to form the octapeptide, angiotensin II (AT2 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] ). Angiotensin II acts primarily through angiotensin receptor type 1 and causes potent vasoconstriction, sodium and water conservation, aldosterone release, and myocardial remodeling. 5 Thus, the traditional view of the RAAS is that of a linear and maladaptive pathological system that is overactive during heart failure and often suppressed using ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and aldosterone antagonists. This understanding changed with the discovery of a homologue of ACE, called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 6, 7 Like ACE, ACE2 is a membrane-bound zinc metalloproteinase; the catalytic site of which is capable of binding various angiotensin peptides (APs), such as AT2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, ACE2 is a mono-carboxypeptidase and it removes only a single amino acid from the C-terminus of its catalytic substrate. 8, 9 For example, ACE2 acts on AT1(1-10) and AT2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) to produce a 9-amino acid peptide called angiotensin 1-9 (Ang1-9) and a 7-amino acid peptide called angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), respectively. 10 Despite being different by only 1 amino acid, the biological effects of Ang1-9 and Ang1-7 are opposite of those associated with AT2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Specifically, Ang1-9 and Ang1-7 are vasodilatory, natriuretic, diuretic, antifibrotic, and antiremodeling. 9 These beneficial APs mediate the majority of their effects by binding to angiotensin receptor type 2 or an endogenous orphan Mas receptor (MasR), as opposed to binding to ATR1. 11, 12 It is now known 9,13 that the ACE2 system provides an endogenous counterbalance to ACE and that an expanded view of the RAAS involves many different APs with structures differing by 1 to 5 amino acids. Thus, RAAS is considerably more complex than those traditionally viewed, and this discovery has uncovered a broad new set of molecules to explore, understand, and potentially modify in subjects with heart disease.",

Our results identify ACE2 immunolabeling and activity in canine LV myocardium. Previous reports in rats 28 and humans 6,28 indicated similar findings, suggesting an important role for ACE2 in cardiac function. Strong immunolabeling and a high degree of ACE2 activity also was found in the renal tubular epithelium, consistent with previous studies in dogs, 29 mice, 30 and humans. 6, 7 Our results indicate that the ACE2 system is regulated differently in dogs with heart disease as compared to healthy dogs. First, plasma ACE2 activity was significantly increased in dogs with CHF, similar to previous reports in human patients with heart disease. In 1 such study, 31 serum ACE2 activity was significantly increased secondary to ischemic and nonischemic heart disease and was independent of medications or comorbidities. In other studies, 32-34 serum ACE2 activity was positively correlated with echocardiographic heart size, negatively correlated with heart function, and was independently associated with important clinical events, including death or hospitalization. The role of circulating or soluble ACE2, as opposed to tissue-bound ACE2, is not fully understood. As previously mentioned, ACE2 is an integral membrane-bound protein and the balance of tissue versus circulating ACE2 is mediated by membrane metalloproteinases that cleave portions of the cell membrane, which then are released into the surrounding extracellular space. 33, 35, 36 The resultant ectosomes contain ACE2 as well as the immediate surrounding extracellular environment and enter the circulation or urine. This process is described as ectodomain shedding. 36, 37 Previous studies 35 indicate that shedding of ACE2 is more frequent than shedding of ACE, which also is highly membrane bound, and that AT2(1-8), tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1\u03b2, and disintegrin metalloproteases are potent stimuli for ACE2 shedding in mice and humans. [37] [38] [39] Thus, the increase in circulating ACE2 might represent pathological displacement of ACE2 from its normal tissue membrane location, mediated in part by a feedback loop in which various substances decrease the activity of its negative regulator. 39 As a result, circulating ACE2, which is removed from its normal location and ideal environment, is hypothesized to represent wasted or ineffective ACE2. 31, 39 In our study, activity of circulating ACE2 normalized to protein amount was approximately 100-fold less than activity of kidney ACE2, which supports this hypothesis. Our results, however, also indicated that both the kidney and LV ACE2 activity were not significantly different in dogs with CHF as compared to healthy dogs, suggesting that ACE2 shedding was not an important factor in the total extent of tissue-bound ACE2 activity, but a loss of tissue ACE2 into the circulation would tend to decrease the overall compensatory potential of ACE2. 31, 33, 39 Further elucidation of a seemingly complex relationship between circulating and tissue ACE2 is needed.",

Specifically, dogs were segregated into those with preclinical (asymptomatic) heart disease (stage B) and those with current or historical signs of CHF (stage C) or those with signs of CHF refractory to standard PO treatment with furosemide, ACEI, positive inotropes, and spironolactone, and therefore in need of additional diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide or torsemide (stage D). Further classification of dogs in stage B occurred depending on the absence (stage B1) or presence (stage B2) of heart enlargement on echocardiography defined as LVIDdN \u2265 1.7 and LA:Ao \u2265 1.6. 17 Venipuncture, blood collection, and storage were performed as previously described. Healthy dogs were recruited as described above. To provide more uniformity to the equilibrium concentrations results in stages B and C, and to best reflect clinical practice at our institution, dogs in stage B were prohibited from receiving ACEI, whereas all dogs in stage C were required to receive ACEI. The plasma equilibrium concentration of 10 different RAAS APs, including AT1(-7), were quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) performed at a commercial laboratory (Attoquant Diagnostics, Vienna, Austria) using previously validated and described methods. 18,19 Testing samples from humans has shown similar qualitative outcomes when comparing the quantification of circulating and equilibrium AP concentrations. 18,19 Two additional calculations were performed using equilibrium AP concentrations. The first calculation was a surrogate measure of plasma renin activity (PRA surr ) calculated as the sum of the AT1(1-10) and AT2(1-8) concentrations and the second a surrogate measure of ACE activity (ACE surr ) calculated as the ratio of AT2(1-8) to AT1(1-10). 20 To explore the effect of exogenous ACE2 on the relative concentrations of selected RAAS APs, plasma samples from stage B2 and stage C dogs also were incubated with 5 \u03bcg/mL of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota) at 37 C, followed by measurement of equilibrium concentrations of AT1(1-10), AT2(1-8), Ang1-9, Ang1-7, and Ang1-5.

Thus, concentrations of AT2(1-8) were not significantly different in stage C as compared to other patient groups.

The exact biologic actions of certain APs are incompletely understood and are predicted based on extension from studies in animal models. Previous studies in mice50,51 indicated that AT3(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8) binds to ATR1, thereby eliciting effects similar to AT2(1-8). Within the central nervous system, AT3(2-8) is the final effector molecule that mediates effects of AT2(1-8), such as release of vasopressin from the pituitary gland. 50 In contrast, despite differing from AT3(2-8) by only a single amino acid, AT4(3-8) binds to MasR and a novel AT4(3-8) receptor, eliciting effects similar to Ang1-7, including prevention of apoptosis, vasodilatation, and anti-remodeling (Figure 8). 52-54 In our study, equilibrium concentrations of AT3(2-8) and AT4(3-8) in dogs with heart disease were not significantly different from those of healthy dogs. The reason for this finding in dogs with preclinical disease might stem from the relatively low overall activity of RAAS whereas in dogs with severe disease and CHF, formation of AT3(2-8) from its precursor, Ang2-10, is primarily mediated by ACE and would have been blocked by the presence of ACEI. Subsequently, low amounts of AT3(2-8) then would limit downstream formation of AT4 (3-8; Figure 8). Relatively little is known about other APs in the expandedRAAS. A previous study47 reported that Ang2-10 is vasodilatory and antiproliferative whereas another study55 reported that Ang2-10 was vasoconstrictive, but likely only after conversion to AT3(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8). As for the remaining APs, in humans, Ang(2-7) induces mild vasoconstriction,56 Ang(3-7) is thought to be a centrally acting vasoconstrictor, 57 and Ang1-5 binds MasR and causes vasodilatation and increased natriuretic peptide release.58 Thus, results of RAAS AP equilibrium analysis in dogs with CHF receiving ACEI indicated an increase in beneficial APs including Ang1-9, Ang1-7, and Ang2-10; no change in beneficial APs including AT4(3-8) and Ang1-5; an increase in maladaptive APs, including Ang2-7 and Ang3-7; and no change in maladaptive APs including AT2(1-8) and AT3(2-8).

The number of samples obtained for kidney and LV myocardial ACE2 activity was small because of difficulty in procuring such samples, and future studies of larger populations might identify important differences. Evaluation of the expanded RAAS was performed using equilibrium analysis and the reported concentrations are higher than the actual circulating concentrations, but the 2 values are highly correlated, 18 which preserve the ability to ascertain relative differences among APs. The expanded model of RAAS remains a simple representation of a highly complex pathophysiological network with many additional (both identified and unidentified) components and relationships. Regardless, the proposed RAAS model offers new insights and proof of concept for a novel treatment strategy. Dogs were receiving a variety of cardiac medications including diuretics and anti-RAAS agents such as ACEI and spironolactone that might have influenced the results. Dogs in the RAAS AP equilibrium analysis included both dogs with DMVD and DCM, and important differences in the magnitude of RAAS AP concentrations might exist. Studies that specifically examine the effect of various treatments on RAAS are of interest. For example, a previous study (Ames MK, Potter BK, Hess A.
