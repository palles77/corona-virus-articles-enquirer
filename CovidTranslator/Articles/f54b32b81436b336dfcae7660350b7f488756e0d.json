The survey was conducted at 17 hospitals and the methods included a questionnaire, site visits and interviews. Nine hospitals had manuals on nosocomial infection control, and seven had an infection control committee (ICC). The number of hospitals that met the required amount of personal protective equipment preparation was as follows: gowns (13), gloves (13), surgical masks (12). Six hospitals had carried out in-service training over the past one year, but seven hospitals responded that no staff had been trained. Eight hospitals were conducting surveillance based on the results of bacteriological testing. The major problems included inadequate management of ICC, insufficient training opportunities for hospital staff, and lack of essential equipment. Moreover, increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics was recognized as a growing issue. In comparison with the results conducted in 2003 targeting five governmental hospitals, a steady improvement was observed, but further improvements are needed in terms of the provision of high quality medical care. Particularly, dissemination of appropriate manuals, enhancement of basic techniques, and strengthening of the infection control system should be given priority.",

In the healthcare setting, particularly in developed countries, various measures including the organization of infection control teams (ICTs), preparation of manuals, strengthening of surveillance systems, and training of staff have been taken to assure effective control. However, it is only some decades ago that importance was attached to nosocomial infection control and effective measures were employed, even in developed countries [3] .",

It is not overstatement to say that such outbreaks have heightened awareness regarding nosocomial infection control even in developing countries.

The results showed that the majority of hospitals did not have an up-to-date nosocomial infection control manual, that the surveillance system was not established sufficiently, and that preparations against SARS and novel influenza were poor. It is crucial to improve these fundamental systems. Moreover, special emphasis should be placed on observance of basic techniques (standard precautions) such as hand hygiene, effective use of PPE and appropriate practice of disinfection [16] [17] [18] . Enlightenment activities, such as distribution of manuals and teaching materials and the organization of training courses for medical staff, are very useful and effective for the improvement of nosocomial infection control. An increasing number of hospitals have been establishing ICCs in recent years, but the management and implementation of activities need further improvement to achieve effective control measures. Hereafter, ICTs also need to be set up in leading hospitals. Furthermore, the detailed status of nosocomial infections and their causative agents should be strictly monitored and properly utilized in clinical practice.",

Bacteriological testing, supervised by the JICA project, was functioning well and contributing to the surveillance of nosocomial infection based on bacteriological examination and reports from clinical departments for suspected nosocomial infection cases. However, our previous study on pathogens associated with nosocomial lower respiratory infections showed a high frequency of gram negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aerginosa, Acinetobactor baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as a high multiple drug resistance rate for isolated bacteria. In addition, a high rate of extended stratum beta lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria was observed [13] . The spread of multi-resistant bacteria reported by many developing countries is considered to be a facilitating factor in nosocomial infection [19] [20] [21] . Methallo \u03b2 lactamase (MBL) producing bacteria, which originated from India, is also suspected to be spreading to Nepal [13, 22] . These findings suggest the need for more aggressive measures to tackle this global threat. The appropriate use of antibiotics based on accurate bacteriological testing, along with appropriate guidelines, is a worldwide challenge. Nepal, fortunately, has not experienced a SARS outbreak, and no human case of avian influenza has been reported to date. On the other hand, awareness of nosocomial infection control seems to be lagging behind countries where a SARS outbreak did occur as shown in the 2003 study [10] . When a novel influenza becomes an epidemic and human to human infection is common, nosocomial infections may easily occur as seen in the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918-1919. Appropriate nosocomial infection control is also considered useful for novel influenza control. Special importance should be placed on setting up a foundation for appropriate nosocomial infection control in daily practice, training medical staff and establishing a control system, before nosocomial infections become a frequent occurrence.",
