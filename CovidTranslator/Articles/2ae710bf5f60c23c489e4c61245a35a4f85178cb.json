Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 \u2103 prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 \u2103 for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples.

[1] [2] [3] Early diagnosis of suspect cases is critical to reduce and interrupt the transmission of COVID-19 from person-to-person. 4 Currently, laboratory testing of viral nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is the \"gold standard\" for COVID-19 diagnosing. 5 However, the requirement of sophisticated instruments and laboratory conditions, tedious experimental procedures, and longer detection time significantly hamper its widespread applicability. 4 Antibodies produced in the blood after COVID-19 infection are emerging as a promising class of biomarkers. 6 The antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are specific, sensitive, and more importantly, their detection can be much faster and simpler than RT-PCR, which allows rapid screening of suspect cases to be possible. 7 All the biological specimens for COVID-19 testing should be considered to be potentially infectious. Therefore, test must be performed by medical professionals with protective equipment in a qualified laboratory. To further reduce the risk of exposure to infectious agents, viral inactivation before sample handling are usually be recommended. 8, 9 While the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to the conditions of inactivation is unknown, it is reported that many coronavirus such as SARS are heat-sensitive and can be killed at 56 \u2103 for 30 minutes. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] It is thus inferred that heating at 56 \u2103 could be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. 15 However, the effect of heating at 56 \u2103 on COVID-19 antibody detection is unclear.

All patients with COVID-19 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. The antibody detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from KingFocus Biomedical engineering Co.,Ltd (AIE/Quantum dot-based fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, AFIA). The immunoassay quantitatively measures IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples before and after heat inactivation at 56 \u2103 for 30 minutes were analyzed according to the protocol. Briefly, 100 microliters of serum was dropped on the test card and the fluorescence signal was measured after 15 minutes. Detection values above the cut-off threshold are considered positive. Results In the patients with COVID-19, the IgM signals of all the 34 serum samples (64%-99.49%]; P < 0.013) after heat inactivation. The IgG signals were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54% ([95% CI,8.76%-90.32%]), and 12 samples (35.29%) increased with a median percentage of 24.22%. 44.12% of the IgM signals form COVID-19 patients were below the cut-off value after heat inactivation. In the non-COVID-19 group, the IgM levels were decreased in 7 of 9 samples (77.78%) by an average of 43.31% (Figure 2) after heat inactivation and 2 samples (22.22%) increased with an average level of 29.84% ([95% CI,5.44%-54.23%]). The IgG signals were decreased in 7 of 9 samples (77.78%) by an average level of 79.42% ([95% CI,44.54%-114.31%]), and 2 samples (22.22%) increased with an average level of 44.00%",
