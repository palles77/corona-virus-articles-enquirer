It contains evolutionary information and provides intuitive visualization. To further analyze the similarity of proteins, we extract a specific vector from the graphical representation curve. The vector is used to calculate the similarity distance between 2 protein sequences. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to 3 real data sets. The results are consistent with the known evolution fact and show that our method is effective in phylogenetic analysis.",

            "text": "With the number of available biological sequences developing rapidly, how to mine essential information from a huge amount of biological sequences effectively and reliably has become a critical problem. As a result, many methods in information extraction are proposed by researchers. Among them, the graphical representation of DNA sequences is an effective method for the virtualization and similarity analysis. Graphical representation is a kind of alignment-free method. It provides intuitive information of data by visualization of biological sequences. What is more, it is more generally applicable because its mathematical description of data facilitates numerical analysis without difficult calculations. Therefore, numerous works based on graphical representation have been presented by researchers. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] For example, Randi\u0107 et al 1 proposed a graphical representation of RNA secondary structure based on twelve symbols. Bieli\u0144ska-Wa\u017c et al 5 proposed a 2D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences in 2007. After that they proposed more dynamic representations of DNA sequences for generalization. 6, 7 However, the graphical representation of protein sequences is much more difficult because there are 20 amino acids instead of 4 nucleotides. Various approaches have been proposed by researchers only until recently. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Among them, many approaches are based primarily on the physicochemical properties of amino acids. Randi\u0107 9 early proposed a 2-dimensional graphical representation of proteins based on a pair of physicochemical properties in 2007. After that, Yu et al 11 proposed a protein mapping method of protein sequences based on 10 physicochemical properties. Wang et al 10 presented a graphical representation of protein sequences based on 9 physicochemical properties. In the works by He et al 15 and Hu, 16 the physicochemical properties are also indispensable in information extraction from proteins because they have effects on the rate and pattern of protein evolution. From these, we can see that physicochemical properties are widely applied with graphical representation of protein sequences by these researchers and their results seem well.",

By computing the similarity distance between pairs of these vectors, we can obtain a similarity distance matrix. Next, we construct the phylogenetic tree based on our method in Figure 3 . To analyze the results better, we mark 2 typical strains: A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) and A/ Indiana/08/2009 (H1N1). From Figure 3 , it is easy to identify that all virus isolates are mainly classified into 2 groups. This illustrates that there are 2 different kinds of influenza A (H1N1) virus isolates from March 1, 2009 to April 30, 2009. ",
