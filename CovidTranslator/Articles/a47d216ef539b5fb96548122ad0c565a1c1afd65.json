A few studies have pointed out that the ventilation systems in air handling units (AHUs) that treat and transmit a new synthetic clean and conditioned environment can also spread and transport viral particles in buildings. The aim of this work is to study the characterization of adenovirus, a DNA non-enveloped respiratory virus, on the F7 fiberglass filter used in AHUs. In this study, an experimental setup simulating an AHU was used. The SYBR \u00d2 QPCR, Electrical Low-Pressure Impactor (ELPI TM ) and Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS TM ) were used to detect, measure and characterize the aerosolized adenovirus solution. The characterization results showed that the nebulized adenovirus could be aerosolized in different forms associated or not with cell debris and proteins. The quantification and level of infectivity of adenovirus demonstrated that viruses passed through filters and remained infectious up-and downstream of the system during the 25 min of aerosolization. This study showed that AHUs should be considered an indoor source of viral contamination.",

            "text": "From the megalopolis to the individual level, the effects of air pollution are of particular interest. Urban air quality and indoor air pollution, which can lead to human health problems, are the most important topics occupying health authorities. According to the study of Jones (1999) , indoor air is 5-10 times more polluted with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than outdoor air. Bioaerosols are airborne particles that originate from living organisms including microorganisms. Different types of microorganisms have been identified as potential contaminants in indoor air, such as spores, bacterial cells and viruses (Douwes et al. 2003) . Indeed, in industrialized countries, people spend 90% of their time in enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces such as homes, offices, shopping centers, gymnasiums and transportation (Aritake et al. 2004; Siegel 2003; Turcotte 2005; Klepeis et al. 2001 ). Bioaerosols, more specifically viral aerosols, lead to diseases and represent a real challenge for the near future because of their high contagiousness. Viral aerosols can be transmitted by simple direct contact, droplets or aerosols. They can cause anything from an ordinary viral infection to an epidemic outbreak (Tellier 2006) .",

These systems treat and transmit new air with temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) regulation and a decrease in the particle concentration from the outside air (Sepp\u00e4nen and Fisk 2004) . Heating, cooling, humidification and filtration are the different steps performed by air handling units (AHUs) to recondition the air. AHUs should be wellmaintained, contributing to good health and productivity. Filter efficiency is defined according to two main standards (EN779 2012; EN1822 2009 , which describe medium-, high-and very high-efficiency filters. Filters are composed of fiber clusters (felts, mats, glass and papers), and their efficiency is characterized by four different mechanisms: sieving, inertia, interception and diffusion (Bailly 2001) .",

            "text": "In general, we expel by simply breathing, coughing, and sneezing (Morawska 2006) . Different studies have pointed out the number of viral particles exhaled during a single breath, sneeze or cough. For influenza viruses, an infected person can exhale 3-20 viruses per minute (Fabian et al. 2011) . A person infected with Coxsackievirus (a pathogenic enterovirus) can emit 160 viral particles when sneezing and coughing (Couch et al. 1966; Downie et al. 1965) . The same studies showed that two infected people breathing in an office without sneezing or coughing could emit 20 viruses per minute, corresponding to 0.24 viruses per liter of air (without renewal of air in an office of 40 m 3 ) (Couch et al. 1966; Downie et al. 1965) . The results of the study by Miller et al. (2017) showed that fine particulate matter (PM) indoors in mechanically ventilated buildings comes from outside. The study of Zhao et al. (2015) evaluated 11 classifications of HVAC filters (MERV5 to HEPA) and ventilation systems located in 22 US cities and demonstrated that higher efficiency HVAC filters are likely to decrease premature mortality, increase life expectancy and yield monetary benefits in all of the homes and locations investigated herein. Some other studies have demonstrated that filters in the ventilation systems can be a source of microbial air pollution and that the ventilation systems and AHUs can spread and transport viral particles inside buildings (Ezratty and Squinazi 2008; Fabian et al. 2008; Tang et al. 2006; Bluyssen et al. 2003) . Some recent studies have detected airborne viruses such as picornavirus, corona virus and parainfluenza virus on AHU filters (Myatt et al. 2004; Goyal et al. 2011; Prussin et al. 2016) . The persistence of the viral particles can be affected by the temperature and relative humidity (RH%) in the AHU. The persistence of influenza viruses increases with decreasing temperature and humidity (Lowen et al. 2007 ). The review of Gerba (2013) revealed differences in inactivation between enveloped and nonenveloped respiratory viruses, with non-enveloped respiratory viruses surviving longer. The fate of mengovirus, a virus whose structure is close to rhinovirus, on the fiberglass filter of an AHU was studied by Bandaly et al. (2017) , who showed that the mengovirus passed through the filter and remained infectious for up to 10 h up-and downstream of the system.",

Therefore, the adenovirus behavior was explored upand downstream of the fiberglass filter used in the AHU.

This aerosolization was carried out by the medical nebulizer (Omron C29-CompAir Pro, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands), which ensures an air flow of 4.5 l min -1 supplied by compressed air. At the upper side of the cylinder, four circular outputs of 4 cm diameter, which accommodate the filters, are arranged perpendicular to the flow. Three of the four outputs are equipped with the filter to be studied. The fourth output results were used to calculate the number of viruses that theoretically impacted on filters. Downstream of the filters, the BioSampler (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA, USA) samples the particles passing through the filters. The sampling rate is 13 l min -1 at the entry of each BioSampler. Two volumetric pumps are set downstream of the device to ensure the flow of treated air through the filters. The frontal filtration velocity at each filter is 0.16 m s -1 and is representative of the velocity observable in the AHUs on a pleated F7 filter. The device is positioned under a laminar flow hood with clean and sterile air ( Fig. 1 ) (Bandaly et al. 2017) .",

The same filter commonly used in AHUs (F7-Camfil EN779:2012) was employed; a filtration velocity of 0.16 m s -1 was applied, and the efficiency of the filtration was between 91 and 99%. This effectiveness was verified in the study of Bailly (2001) , which determined the air filter efficiency based on the four filtration phenomena curves. Adenovirus, a DNA respiratory virus measuring between 70 and 90 nm, was chosen (Doerfler 1996) . In this study, we carefully studied the molecular detection and infectivity up-and downstream of the filters and the dynamics and characteristics of the adenovirus in the system. The SMPS TM has a median electric mobility size (d ae.50 ) of 87 nm, close to the theoretical size of adenovirus described in the study of Doerfler (1996) . According to the apoptotic phenomenon and the way in which adenovirus multiplies in the HEK-293 cell, we can propose some hypotheses about the virus aerosol. The particles detected by Q-PCR on the stages below the virus size may be DNA fragments because of the apoptosis effect that disrupted the cells (Green 2011) . These disruptions may lead to autodegradation of the cell such as DNA degradation, which affected the DNA virus used in our study (Green 2011) .

This hypothesis corresponds to reality; the function of sneezing is to expel mucus containing irritants from the nasal cavity and microorganisms such as respiratory viruses (Cole and Cook 1998) . Based on Q-PCR and TCID 50 measurement for the quantification and detection of infectivity in the system, the study shows that adenovirus was stopped by the medium F7 filter, but some particles passed through the filters and remained infectious. A negligible loss of infectivity was detected, confirming the study of Davis et al. (1971) who showed that the maximum adenovirus survival occurred at a high relative humidity of up to 89%. This RH value was observed in this experimental setup during the 25 min of aerosolization. The examined literature shows the presence of viruses on the filters of air treatment plants by molecular detection without any notion of the infectivity and fate of these viruses. The study of Goyal et al. (2011) did not detect any infectious viruses in used ventilation filters from two large public buildings, but they were able to detect viruses by PCR, while Farnsworth et al. (2006) showed the difficulty of detecting the persistence of viruses in AHUs since most viruses present on AHU filters are deactivated within a day.",

Morphologically, adenovirus is a DNA virus with a size between 70 and 90 nm (Doerfler 1996) , while mengovirus is an RNA virus with a smaller size between 22 and 30 nm (Faulkner et al. 1961) . The physiologic differences are based on their multiplication in the host cells and their virulence. Adenovirus shows an apoptotic effect in the host cells, whereas mengovirus multiplication has a cytopathic effect. These different types of multiplication lead to different ways of virus release, as shown by comparing this work with the study of Bandaly et al. (2017) in which the initial viral solution had a greater cytopathic effect with mengovirus being released more easily with the bursting of cells than adenovirus in apoptotic cells. The study of Knight (1980) and the review of Gerba (2013) focused on the inactivation rate between respiratory viruses and showed that adenovirus has a low inactivation rate (0.011 log 10 h -1 ), whereas mengovirus, with a similar structure to rhinovirus, has a higher inactivation rate (0.25 log 10 h -1 ). These values are validated by comparing this work with the study of Bandaly et al. (2017) , as adenovirus was more persistent in the system after aerosolization with a loss of \\ 1 log, but mengovirus showed a loss of 4 log of infectivity.",
