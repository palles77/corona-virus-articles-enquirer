            "text": "A microbe-contaminated toilet will produce bioaerosols when flushed. We assessed toilet plume aerosol from high efficiency (HET), pressure-assisted high efficiency (PAT), and flushometer (FOM) toilets with similar bowl water and flush volumes. Total and droplet nuclei \"bioaerosols\" were assessed. Monodisperse 0.25-1.9-\u03bcm fluorescent microspheres served as microbe surrogates in separate trials in a mockup 5 m 3 water closet (WC). Bowl water seeding was approximately 10 12 particles/mL. Droplet nuclei were sampled onto 0.2-\u03bcm pore size mixed cellulose ester filters beginning 15 min after the flush using open-face cassettes mounted on the WC walls. Pre-and postflush bowl water concentrations were measured. Filter particle counts were analyzed via fluorescent microscopy. Bowl headspace droplet count size distributions were bimodal and similar for all toilet types and flush conditions, with 95% of droplets <2 \u03bcm diameter and >99% <5 \u03bcm. Up to 145,000 droplets were produced per flush, with the high-energy flushometer producing over three times as many as the lower energy PAT and over 12 times as many as the lowest energy HET despite similar flush volumes. The mean numbers of fluorescent droplet nuclei particles aerosolized and remaining airborne also increased with flush energy. Fluorescent droplet nuclei per flush decreased with increasing particle size. These findings suggest two concurrent aerosolization mechanisms-splashing for large droplets and bubble bursting for the fine droplets that form droplet nuclei.",

            "text": "The potential for airborne transmission of sewage-related infectious disease was experimentally demonstrated over 100 years ago by Horrocks (1907) , who found that sewage flowing smoothly in pipes as well as bursting bubbles in sewage would produce airborne microbes that could be transported substantial distances in the sewer system air while remaining viable. More recently, airborne transport of the SARS coronavirus by such sewage-related bioaerosols was proposed as the likely disease transmission mode in the 2003 SARS outbreak at the Amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong Kong (Yu et al. 2004 ; Hong Kong Special Administrative Unit Department of Health 2011). Production of both large droplet and droplet nuclei bioaerosols during toilet flushing has been shown for a variety of toilet types and microorganisms (Jessen 1955; Darlow and Bale 1959; Bound and Atkinson 1966; Gerba et al. 1975; Scott and Bloomfield 1985; Yahya et al. 1992 ; Barker and Bloomfield 2000; Barker and Jones 2005) . As initially defined by Wells (1934) , droplet nuclei are the residuals of larger droplets whose water content has largely or completely evaporated; they are of sufficiently small size that they will not settle on surfaces due to the force of gravity but rather will remain airborne and be carried on air currents. Large droplet contamination of toilet seats and lids, the surrounding floors, and nearby surfaces (Jessen 1955; Darlow and Bale 1959; Newsom 1972; Gerba et al. 1975; Yahya et al. 1992; Barker and Jones 2005) is a well-recognized contact transmission risk in health care and other facilities (Sehulster and Chinn 2003) . In contrast, the potential for airborne transmission of infectious disease via \"toilet plume\" droplet nuclei bioaerosols has not been generally acknowledged. This is perhaps due to the difficulty in distinguishing epidemio-logically between contact transmission that may have occurred via contact with large droplets or contaminated surfaces as opposed to airborne transmission that may have occurred via inhalation of droplet nuclei.",

Furthermore, sequential flushes following an initial toilet contamination continue to produce bioaerosols (Barker and Jones 2005; Darlow and Bale 1959; Yahya et al. 1992) . Viruses may be particularly difficult to clear from the toilet; Yahya et al. (1992) found that viral bioaerosols were still being produced even after seven flushes after contamination. These studies suggest a possible role of biological films as a reservoir and the potential for multiple bioaerosol generation events due to a single contamination.",

Some fraction of the aerosol droplets produced when a contaminated toilet is flushed may be expected to contain these microbes (Raabe 1968 ). Whether toilet bioaerosol droplets will deposit on nearby surfaces or evaporate to form droplet nuclei that move with air currents depends primarily on the initial droplet size and the initial vertical distance from a deposition surface (Wells 1934; Xie et al. 2007 ); for a given situation droplets smaller than a \"critical size\" will evaporate to droplet nuclei before reaching the surface, whereas larger droplets will not. The critical droplet size is determined by the droplet evaporation rate and the droplet's settling velocity, which are complex interrelated functions dependent on environmental conditions (Hinds 1999; Xie et al. 2007) . To date no studies have reported the initial droplet size distribution of toilet plume aerosols or how the size distribution and aerosol concentration vary across toilet designs and operating modes. Therefore, it has not been possible to estimate the fraction of total aerosol that may produce potentially infectious droplet nuclei bioaerosols, or the concentrations of droplet nuclei that might result, during toilet flushing. The purpose of the present work was to characterize the initial droplet size distribution immediately after a toilet flush and the droplet nuclei aerosol generation rate for a range of toilet types.",

            "text": "Toilets are sold in a wide variety of designs, and the most common types may be conveniently classed as gravity-flow, pressure-assisted gravity flow, or pressure-valve (commercially termed \"flushometer\") systems. Gravity flow is the type typically found in residences, consisting of a base containing the toilet bowl and a close-coupled or integral water tank (also termed a \"cistern\"). When the flush lever is activated, a valve in the tank bottom opens to allow water to flow under gravity into the toilet bowl, initiating the flush. In contrast, the flushometer toilets that are often seen in public restrooms consist of a base but no tank, with the building water supply attached directly to a flush valve via a 1-inch diameter pipe that delivers a vigorous water flow to the toilet when activated by a manual flush lever or automatic flush sensor. A recent innovation that provides the vigorous flush of a flushometer system without the requirement for a high flow capacity water connection is the pressure-assisted toilet. This toilet has the appearance of a typical gravity-flow toilet in that it has a tank attached to the base; however, a compressed air bladder pressure vessel inside the tank provides stored energy to drive the water flow and thereby simulate the flushometer system.",

Furthermore, water conservation concerns have prompted greater marketing of high efficiency toilets, or HETs. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's \"WaterSense\" specification limits HETs to no more than 80% of the 6 Lpf value, or 4.8 Lpf (1.28 gpf) (United States Environmental Protection Agency 2011). Another water-saving innovation was the introduction of dualflush toilets providing for user selection of a lower or higher flush volume, depending on whether liquid only or solids were being flushed. The first dual-flush toilets were invented in Australia 30 years ago and have long been in widespread use there and in Europe but have only recently been widely marketed in the United States. The lower flush volume on these systems is approximately 3.8 Lpf (1 gpf).",

Previous investigators have noted greater aerosol production with higher flush energies (Bound and Atkinson 1966; Jessen 1955) , as intuition might suggest, and the three post-FEPA toilet types were selected because their different operating modes provide different degrees of flush energy and associated bowl water agitation during flushing.",

Air entering the trapway when the bowl water level falls below the top of the inlet breaks the siphon and some volume of the flushed water drains back into the bowl. A secondary flush water flow passes through perforations spaced around the underside of the bowl rim and washes down the bowl walls during the flush. The jets may be angled to induce a swirling in the bowl water. The three post-FEPA toilet models had been evaluated under the Maximum Performance (MaP) Program, a joint US-Canada effort to test the clearance performance of toilets using a standard protocol, and achieved the highest MaP clearance performance rating (Gauley and Koeller 2009) .

Seals and clamps around a 3 \u00d7 6 ft (91 \u00d7 183 cm) clear plastic access door provided an airtight enclosure. A highfrequency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered air supply, HEPA-filtered exhaust, and blast gate flow damper allowed the WC to be purged under slight positive differential pressure at an effective ventilation rate of approximately 18 air changes per hour (ACH) with particle-free air prior to toilet flushing. Complete clearance of background particles at least as small as 0.3 micrometers (\u03bcm) was verified using a Grimm Model 1.108 aerosol spectrometer (Grimm Aerosol Technik GmbH, Ainring, Germany). The spectrometer was placed inside the WC with the digital concentration readout visible through the clear WC door and operated continuously during the purging period. The logged concentration data were subsequently downloaded and analyzed to determine the effective ventilation rate. Air sampling ports were installed at heights of 22.5 and 64 inches (57 and 163 cm) on the two side walls (Figure 3 ). These ports were connected to air sampling pumps located outside the WC for monitoring and adjustment during air sampling. Pump flows were calibrated at 1.5 liters per minute (Lpm) using a bubble tube primary standard. A glove port in the rear wall allowed the toilet to be flushed from outside the WC.",

No. A020A025A, Toyo Roshi Kaisha Ltd., Japan) were attached at each of the four sampling ports. The cassettes and o-rings were rinsed in acetone and air dried before assembly to dissolve away any polymer microsphere contamination. The Viton o-rings provided with the cassettes were replaced with perfluoroacetate (PFA or Teflon \u00ae ) coated silicon core o-rings (PSP Inc., Denver, CO, USA) due to Viton's incompatibility with acetone and because the Viton o-rings tended to deform when the cassette cap was tightened, wrinkling the filter. Purging for 45 minutes was followed by a 5-min pause to allow damping of WC air currents before flushing the toilet. Because only the simulated droplet nuclei bioaerosols were of interest, another 5-min pause after the flush allowed time for large droplets to settle out on the floor, on toilet surfaces, or back into the bowl water. The WC air was then mixed with a small fan for 5 min to disperse the remaining droplet nuclei aerosols more evenly throughout the WC volume before starting the air sampling pumps. Pump flow rates were closely monitored and adjusted as necessary to maintain constant 1.5 Lpm flow during a 30-min sampling period, providing a 45-L air sample volume. The 0.25-\u03bcm minimum particle size was chosen because this was the smallest fluorescent particle that could be accurately counted; larger particles are easier to count, but there was concern that they would be less likely to be aerosolized as described by Raabe (1968) and would also be less representative of microbes of virus size.

The particle count divided by the aliquot volume and multiplied by the dilution factor provided an estimate of the suspension concentration in each water sample. The ratio of pre-to postflush concentrations was a measure of toilet clearance. The product of the difference in pre-and postflush concentrations and the bowl water volume or the preflush concentration and the bowl water volume provided essentially the same estimate of the number of fluorescent particles flushed, because clearances were usually on the order of 3 logs or 99.9%. The ratio of the number of fluorescent droplet nuclei to the number of fluorescent particles present preflush was used as the measure of droplet nuclei aerosol generation rate, G. This was scaled up via a 10 8 multiplier to give particles generated per 100 million particles present preflush.",

The aerosol spectrometer recorded particle count concentrations in each of 15 particle size bins ranging from 0.3 to >20 \u03bcm every 6 s. The measurement data revealed zero concentrations across size bins after HEPA purging and immediately before the toilet flush. After a flush the instrument usually measured particle counts in nearly all size bins during the first 15 seconds postflush except for the >20 \u03bcm counts, which were typically at or very near zero. The counts for particles larger than approximately 5-\u03bcm-diameter reached a maximum in the 15-30 s period and declined after the first minute, suggesting removal by gravitational settling or shrinkage to smaller sizes by evaporation. Such shrinkage will occur even under saturation humidity conditions, though more slowly than under drier conditions. In contrast, counts across all of the smaller size bins increased to a peak between 1 and 2 min postflush, then also declined. The increases in the smaller sizes were in far greater numbers than the reductions in counts for the larger particle sizes and occurred across all size bins, suggesting droplet growth by condensation in the high-humidity bowl environment rather than simply contributions to the smaller size bins by evaporation of larger droplets. As discussed by Hinds (1999) (pp. 288-292) , heterogeneous nucleation around soluble condensation nuclei can occur even under unsaturated atmospheric conditions, and the droplets will grow to a maximum size that is determined by the mass of solute in the condensation nucleus and the relative humidity. The filtered flush water used in these experiments was from the building mains supply and had a total dissolved solids concentration of approximately 120 ppm. These naturally occurring dissolved minerals would be expected to act as condensation nuclei, along with those naturally present in the air in spite of HEPA filtration.",

The calculations assumed a uniform concentration throughout the bowl air space, and though this could not be verified the estimate provides a basis for comparison across toilet types. After verifying homogeneity of variance using an F-test, a one-way ANOVA of the droplet generation rates indicated a statistically significant difference between toilets/flush conditions (p < 0.0001), and a Tukey's test (overall a = 0.05) further indicated significant differences between the toilets but not between the low and high volume flush conditions for either the HET or PAT. As Table 1 shows, the mean droplet generation rate per liter flushed was highest for the FOM toilet (~25,600) and lowest for the HET (~2100-2200). The mean total number of droplets produced per flush was also greatest for the FOM toilet (~145,000 droplets) and lowest for the HET (~8000-10,000). Notably, the FOM toilet produced 2.7 times as many droplets as the pre-FEPA toilet even though it had less than half (40%) of the pre-FEPA's flushed water volume. It also produced 3.5 times as many droplets as the next highest post-FEPA toilet. This appears to support an association between flush energy and aerosol production.",

These results support the conclusion by Jessen and subsequent investigators that flush droplet production increases with increasing flush energy. Flush energy cannot be directly measured, and at any rate is a surrogate descriptor for the degree of agitation the water undergoes during the flush. The effects of agitation on aerosol production from biological suspensions have been studied with regard to aerated activated sludge sewage treatment systems and aerated fermenters. Brandi et al. (2000) and Sanchez-Monedero et al. (2008) noted that mechanical agitation increased bioaerosol production from aerated sewage treatment plants, and Pilacinski et al. (1990) observed an increase in both the number and size of aerosol droplets produced from aerated fermentor broths as the degree of mechanical agitation increased. It seems plausible that the effects of flush agitation on bioaerosol production from contaminated toilets would be similar, but this is an area requiring further research.",

            "text": "The observation that flush aerosol generation is not proportional to the preflush bowl water particle loading seems contrary to logic if one assumes that the aerosolization mechanism is related to simple splashing. Such an assumption appears to be supported by observations that aerosol production seems to increase with increasing flush energy. Nevertheless, the data show the splash generation model does not hold up, at least for droplet nuclei aerosol production, and we therefore propose a different mechanism be considered. The somewhat bimodal droplet size distributions of the flush droplets were consistent with an aerosol generation mechanism that includes bubble bursting. Bubbles bursting at the liquid surface will produce two populations of droplets: fine \"film droplets\" and larger \"jet droplets\" (Tomaides and Whitby 1976) . Film droplets are produced by the breakup of the bubble film layer as the bubble rises through the liquid surface and range from submicrometer size to approximately 20 \u03bcm (Garner et al. 1954; Blanchard 1963; Cipriano and Blanchard 1981) , whereas jet droplets are produced at the tip of a jet of liquid projected upward from the center of the bubble depression in the liquid surface (MacIntyre 1972). Jet droplets are typically an order of magnitude larger than film droplets (Newitt et al. 1954 ) and may be projected tens of centimeters above the water surface at initial ejection velocities of up to several meters per second (Gunther et al. 2003) . The absence of visible spatter on the toilet cover plate and particle counts in the >20-\u03bcm Grimm spectrometer data from size distribution measurements suggest that jet drops were not a substantial constituent of the toilet flush aerosols. The number of film droplets decreases with decreasing bubble size (Blanchard 1963; Day 1964) , from as many as 1000 film droplets for a 6-mm-diameter bubble (Blanchard and Syzdek 1982) to very few film droplets for bubbles less than approximately 1 mm (Gunther et al. 2003) . In contrast, the number of jet droplets increases with decreasing bubble size, with bubbles less the 0.3-mm-diameter producing five or more jet droplets (Blanchard and Syzdek 1982) . Bubbles in the flush water may be produced when air is entrained in agitated water, as by a submerged jet or during a turbulent flush, in a manner similar to air entrainment in seawater by wave action and whitecaps (see, e.g., the discussion by Kerman 1986) . The resulting bubble burst aerosol would thus be expected to be somewhat bimodal, as was seen by Baron and Willeke (1986) when they measured droplet aerosols above heated whirlpools agitated with jets. Bubble-burst production of aerosols, including bioaerosols, has been studied above bodies of sea water and fresh water (Blanchard and Syzdek 1970, 1972; Baylor et al. 1977; Blanchard and Syzdek 1978; Blanchard et al. 2011) , and to some extent in whirlpool baths (Baron and Willeke 1986 ), but to date has not been explored as a mechanism for toilet aerosol production. Since bioaerosol of respirable size produced by bubble bursting in a whirlpool contaminated with Legionella pneumophila has been associated with an outbreak of Pontiac Fever (Mangione et al. 1985) , and a number of studies have demonstrated the potential for toilets to produce bioaerosols during flushing (reviewed briefly above and in detail by Johnson et al. 2013) . We propose bubble bursting as a likely mechanism for droplet nuclei bioaerosol production from pathogen-contaminated toilets and believe this to be a logical area for further research.",

Pathogens including Shigella, E. coli, Clostridium difficile, SARS coronavirus, and norovirus (Thomson 1955; Caul 1994; Atmar et al. 2008) can be present in vomit or stools of infected persons and can survive on surfaces for weeks or even months (Kramer et al. 2006) . As has been shown, hundreds to thousands of potentially infectious bioaerosol particles, capable of remaining airborne for extended periods and migrating with air currents, may be generated in a single flush of a toilet contaminated with these organisms. Whether a subsequent bioaerosol exposure results in disease would of course depend on the organism's viability under existing environmental conditions, the number of organisms inhaled and their virulence, and the exposed person's immune status among other factors (Cox 1987) , but it is difficult to imagine that such transmission is not occurring. Separating the incidence of disease transmission by contact and droplet routes from that by the airborne route is a challenge that remains to be met.",

Future work should allow for larger sample sizes as determined by power calculations using these observed variances. A second limitation was the data volatility inherent in measurements of very low airborne particle concentrations, as seen with larger particle sizes, which limited the interpretability of these data. A third limitation, from the risk assessment perspective, was the use of monodisperse fluorescent polymer particles rather than actual microbes. However, the purpose of this work was to characterize the initial droplet size distribution immediately after a toilet flush and the potential for droplet nuclei aerosol generation for a range of toilet types, with an eye toward elucidating the toilet design factors governing aerosol production, rather than to provide data directly applicable in risk assessment. Further work using specific microbes of interest is required to better estimate airborne infectious disease transmission risk.",
