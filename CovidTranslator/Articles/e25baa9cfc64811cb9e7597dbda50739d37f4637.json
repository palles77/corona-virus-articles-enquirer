Exact test was used to test association of individual viruses and coinfections with URTI/LRTI. The first sample test positive for any virus was used for this purpose. The first episode of URTI or LRTI was used for analysis, whether or not a virus was isolated. Patients with both URTI and LRTI were classified as LRTI. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between LRTI and clinical variables including age as a continuous variable, gender, race, ANC <500 cells/\u03bcL, ALC <100 cells/\u03bcL, use of steroids \u22642 weeks before infection, underlying disease (LL versus solid tumor versus brain tumor versus post-HCT), in-patient versus out-patient status and the 9 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial pathogens detected. All factors that demonstrated a statistical association (P = 0.15) were included in the multiple logistic regression model. Potential confounders were assessed using exact test. Duration of shedding was analyzed in a descriptive manner. All reported P-values were 2-sided and considered significant if <0.05.

One was a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who developed PIV3 infection while undergoing reduced-intensity conditioning for an allogeneic HCT. He became tachypneic on day +5 post-HCT, requiring mechanical ventilation, and died on day +14, from respiratory failure. The other was a patient with infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia, week 22 of reinduction, who was admitted with respiratory distress, an ANC of 1400 and ALC of 0 cells/\u03bcL. After detection of RSV, therapy was instituted with ribavirin and palivizumab. She improved for several days, subsequently her respiratory distress worsened, requiring mechanical ventilation 4 weeks into hospitalization, and she died 2 weeks later from respiratory failure. This patient was coinfected with HRV.",

There was no seasonality of detection, median duration of shedding was 3 (range 0-49) weeks and 3 (1%) patients had LRTI. 16 HRV showed a seasonal pattern and was detected in 65% of children with LRTI in our series. Progression to LRTI with HRV infection has been noted in immunocompetent children <5 years of age, in association with a high viral load. 17 In a retrospective hospital-based study, hCoV was detected using molecular methods, in 66 of 1043 (6.3%) children. Of 32 children infected with hCoV as the sole pathogen, 13 (41%) had LRTI. Six of the 32 patients were immunocompromised, and 2 had LRTI. 2 Milano et al detected hCoV in 22 (10%) adult HCT patients. Cases were more common in winter, median duration of shedding was 3 (range 0-22) weeks and 1 (0.5%) patient had LRTI. 16 hCoV showed a seasonal distribution, and was seen with LRTI in 5% of children in our series. However, the prevalence of hCoV in 1 series was not significantly higher in symptomatic immunocompetent children, compared with asymptomatic controls. 18 Similarly, others have shown similar rates of detection of hBoV in immunocompetent patients with pneumonia who did not have coinfection with other viruses, compared with controls. 19 Although hBoV was significantly associated with pneumonia requiring hospitalization in that study, coinfections with other viruses were common. Of the 7 patients with LRTI where hBoV was detected in our series, 4 had coinfections with other viruses, only 1 patient required oxygen therapy and all resolved without any complications. Further studies to assess the role of hBoV in asymptomatic immunocompromised controls are needed. The role of hBoV as a respiratory pathogen presently remains unclear.",

Hence ARI may be underestimated if only febrile episodes are studied. A higher incidence of positive tests for respiratory viruses and LRTI has been seen in children with hematological malignancies compared with immunocompetent controls. 23 Our study had the advantage of being prospective, using multiplexed molecular diagnostics to detect newly described respiratory viruses in a unique population. Healthy asymptomatic patients can shed HRV, 1 and hCoV, 18 hence inferences on causality should be made with caution in symptomatic patients. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for quantitative HRV detection have shown that cutoff values for clinical relevance in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are feasible. 24 This could have implications for infection control. Currently all patients with symptoms of ARI are placed in respiratory isolation at our institution. Furthermore, accurate diagnosis of HRV infection in these patients may have future treatment implications. The antiviral pleconaril inhibits in vitro replication of most rhinoviruses. Double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that early pleconaril treatment was well tolerated, and led to significant reduction in symptom severity and frequency of recovery of HRV within 1 day after initiation of therapy. 25 A major limitation of our study is a lack of asymptomatic immunocompromised control patients in each disease subset, for case-control analysis. Nasopharyngeal washes although preferred for respiratory sample collection are not well tolerated by children due to the unpleasant sensation of saline in the nasopharynx. This precluded inclusion of an adequate number of control subjects for case-control comparison. Furthermore, there is absence of viral load data, and sampling was based on presence of symptoms of ARI with no follow-up in patients who later became asymptomatic. The number of repeated samples per patient was likely not often enough to capture true duration of shedding. Because bronchoalveolar lavage was not performed in the majority of patients with LRTI, copathogens may have either not been detected or overrepresented.",
