As part of the risk assessment process, the community looks at its vulnerability to biological events, and as the 2001 Amerithrax incident revealed, each community has some vulnerability to bioterrorism. Community planners and emergency managers need to evaluate the consequence of such an event and ask the question: If it were to happen here, how bad might it be? Along with this question, they must assess their organic capability to handle anticipated consequences. That said, many community planners would determine that, even if a biological event were to happen, the consequences would be minimal. Although that assessment might prove to be true with respect to adverse effects to life, property, and the environment, it greatly underestimates the economic and societal impact of an act of bioterrorism.",

Surveillance data must be timely and complete to accurately reflect the occurrence and distribution of disease. The types of surveillance currently used are: \u2022 Passive disease surveillance refers to the receipt of reports of infections and diseases from physicians, laboratories, and other health professionals required to submit the reports required by public health statute. \u2022 Active disease surveillance is guided by public health statute in each state and refers to the routine gathering of data in an effort to identify cases. This type of surveillance can be seasonal or initiated by a mass casualty event that has resulted in an increased number of individuals or potential cohorts presenting with similar symptoms or illnesses. \u2022 Syndromic surveillance has been used for early detection of outbreaks; to follow the size, spread, and tempo of outbreaks; to monitor disease trends; and to provide reassurance that an outbreak has not occurred. Syndromic surveillance systems seek to use existing health data in real time to provide immediate analysis and feedback to those charged with the investigation and follow-up of potential outbreaks. The fundamental objective of syndromic surveillance is to identify illness clusters early, before diagnoses are confirmed and reported to public health agencies, and to mobilize a rapid response, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. Passive surveillance systems rely on laboratory and hospital staff, physicians, and other relevant sources to take the initiative to provide data on illnesses to the health department, where officials analyze and interpret the information as it arrives. In contrast, in an active disease surveillance system, public health officials contact sources, such as laboratories, hospitals, and physicians, to obtain information on conditions or diseases to identify cases. In theory, active surveillance can provide more complete detection of disease patterns than a system that is wholly dependent on voluntary reporting. Having dedicated personnel to accomplish active surveillance is a challenge for any administrator. Public health departments are traditionally thin on staffing. Taking staff time to look for a problem that may or may not exist, at the expense of one of the many ongoing daily health department programs, is problematic.",

Whenever an act of biological terrorism occurs, no matter how seemingly insignificant, facets of the federal government are set into motion. As such, local communities and state governments must be prepared to receive and work with elements of the federal government. Previous incidents, disasters, and catastrophic events made it clear that the nation needed a uniform approach to managing an incident. Accordingly, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 called for the NIMS to respond to and manage domestic incidents by establishing a single, comprehensive incident management system. The command and management component of NIMS mandates the use of the ICS to allow for a consistent command structure and clear, concise communications through common language to support interoperability between responders from the local level to the federal level. For hospitals, this framework has been extended through the Hospital Incident Command System. For public health agencies, a similar but new framework, known as the Public Health Incident Command System, is being adopted (Qureshi et al., 2005) . Regardless of the agency, small or large, the framework remains the same, although the roles and responsibilities vary based on the agencies' jurisdictional duties and statute.",

ICS provides a framework for coordinated effort to ensure an effective response and the efficient, safe use of resources, regardless of the size or agencies involved. The concept of ICS was developed more than 30 years ago in the aftermath of a devastating wildfire in California. Over a 13-day period in 1970, 700 structures were destroyed and 16 lives were lost, some because of lack of coordination and poor command and control. As a result, Congress mandated that the US Forest Service design a system to effectively coordinate interagency actions. As such, Firefighting Resources of California Organized for Potential Emergencies (FIRESCOPE) was established as a primary command and control system (California Office of Emergency Services, FIRESCOPE, 2004). Its organization delineated job responsibilities and organizational structure for managing the day-to-day operations of all types of emergency incidents. FIRESCOPE eventually led to the ICS.",

Also a part of the National Disaster Medical System, the disaster mortuary response teams can be rapidly deployed to disaster sites to help identify, track, and process fatalities at a CBRNE event. Their specialty is forensics, identification of remains, and temporary holding of corpses pending outcome of the investigation.

After taking off gear, response workers should shower using copious quantities of soap and water. In a known or suspected release, decontamination of biological materials is a four-step process. That process is detailed as follows: 1. Wet down the person; this allows the biological material (contamination) to adhere to clothing and skin, thus reducing the airborne hazard and the potential for ingestion and inhalation. 2. Strip contaminated clothing. 3. Flush the victim with a large amount of water, using soap if available, to remove any remaining contamination from skin and hair.

The lack of mutual awareness and understanding, as well as the absence of established communication procedures, could hinder the effectiveness of law enforcement's and public health's separate, but often overlapping, investigations.

Many experts believe that the inherent rigidity in a standard operating protocol for crime scene processing could be unwieldy and impractical in a bioterrorism event, which may compromise evidence collection in some cases. Therefore consultation among the different entities involved in a response should provide best-practice options framed on established guidelines. The plan can be modified after greater scrutiny of the crime scene or as more information is obtained during the course of the investigation.
