According to its essential role in cellular homeostasis, autophagy has been implicated in several pathologies including cancer, neurodegeneration and myopathies. More recently, autophagy has been described as a mechanism of both innate and adaptive immunity against intracellular bacteria and viruses. In this context, autophagy has been proposed as a protective mechanism against viral infection by degrading the pathogens into autolysosomes. This is strengthened by the fact that several proteins involved in interferon (IFN) signalling pathways are linked to autophagy regulation. However, several viruses have evolved strategies to divert IFN-mediated pathways and autophagy to their own benefit. This review provides an overview of the autophagic process and its involvement in the infection by different viral pathogens and of the connections existing between autophagy and proteins involved in IFN signalling pathways.",

Two major pathways are involved in the degradation of macromolecules in eukaryotes: the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and autophagy. The former is involved in the constitutive degradation of shortlived proteins, maintaining a continuous protein turn-over in the cell [1] . Autophagy, which literally means \"to eat oneself\", is necessary for the lysosomal degradation and recycling of long-lived proteins and entire organelles [2] . This process has been observed in all eukaryotes and is morphologically identical in plants, yeasts and animals. Autophagy can be classified into at least three different types: macroautophagy, J Mol Med (2007) 85:811-823 ",

            "text": "microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The last one is the only autophagic process that is not conserved through evolution and exits only in higher eukaryotes. The first CMA substrate identified was ribonuclase A and a particular motif in this protein, KFERQ, was shown necessary for its selective degradation. This motif is recognised by the chaperone protein Hsc70 and targeted to lysosomal membranes where Hsc70 interacts with the lysosomal membrane protein (lamp) type 2a. The substrates are then translocated to the lysosomal lumen where they are degraded. It is now known that all the CMA substrates contain a KFERK-like motif, which is recognised by the hsc70. This motif is composed of a basic (K, R), an acidic (D, E), a hydrophobic (F, I, L, V), and another basic or hydrophobic amino acid and is flanked by a Q on either side [3] . Microautophagy is characterised by the invagination of the lysosomal membrane that sequesters cytoplasmic constituents and, subsequently, degradation of the sequestered material. Macroautophagy is the major lysosomal route for the turnover of cytoplasmic constituents, and will hereafter be referred as autophagy. This process begins with an engulfment event of portions of the cytosol into a characteristic double-membrane vacuole, called the autophagosome. After maturation, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes for the degradation of the sequestered material by lysosomal hydrolases. This last event allows the recycling of the degraded constituents [4, 5] .",

Interestingly, it has been shown recently that the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and autophagy are connected. Indeed, Atg7 knock-out mice present an accumulation of ubiquitinated aggregates. This observation suggests that, in addition to the proteasome pathway, ubiquitinated proteins can be removed by autophagy [7] . Moreover, it may also reflect a compensatory mechanism in the absence of autophagy.",

Another possibility is that the membranes are unique or formed de novo [10] . Thus, it has been proposed that, in mammals, autophagosomes derived from a unique membrane of unknown origin, called the phagophore. Furthermore, a novel structure necessary for autophagosome formation, called the preautophagosomal structure (PAS), has been identified in yeast [11] .",

The term immunophagy has recently been proposed by Deretic [13] for the specialised role of autophagy in immunity. A new field of investigation is now emerging about the role of autophagy in viral infections. Besides its role as an intracellular host defence pathway against viruses, autophagy can also be used by the virus for its own profit to replicate more efficiently in the cells, or to control cell survival [16] . The term virophagy could be used to define the relationships that exist between autophagy and viral infections. In this paper, presented are the different molecular steps of the autophagic process, its implication in both cell survival and cell death and the relationships that are known between autophagy and viral infections.",

The discovery of Atg genes has been essential in the molecular understanding of this process. A major challenge in the autophagy field is now to decipher the signalling pathways that act downstream the initial autophagy induction signals.

The mammalian class III PI3K/Beclin 1 complex has its yeast counterpart that consists in the association of Vps34 (the ortholog of class III PI3K) with the autophagic proteins Atg6 and Atg14 [22] . The mammalian counterpart of Atg14 has not been identified so far. Recent data suggest that other proteins belong to this complex and thus regulate the outcome of the signalling via class III PI3K. Indeed, Bcl-2 can negatively regulate the activation of autophagy through its interaction with Beclin 1 [24] .

            "text": "The autophagic process depends on two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems essential for autophagosome formation [26] (Fig. 2 ). In general, three different enzymes are required for the process of conjugation: an E1-activating enzyme, an E2-conjugating enzyme and an E3 ligase enzyme. The first conjugation system mediates formation of the conjugate Atg12/Atg5. Atg12 is activated by the E1like enzyme Atg7, and then Atg12 is transferred to the E2like enzyme Atg10. Finally, Atg12 is covalently linked to a specific lysine of Atg5. No E3-like enzyme has been discovered to date. Then, the conjugate Atg12/Atg5 interacts non-covalently with Atg16L (Atg16 in yeast) to trigger homo-oligomerisation, leading to the formation of a macromolecular complex of approximately 800 kDa (350 kDa in yeast) necessary for the formation of autophagosomes. This structure is associated with the outer side of the autophagosomes in formation and dissociates from membranes before the autophagosome completion. The second conjugation system is original because it consists in the conjugation of a protein to a lipid, resulting in the formation of the Atg8/PE (phosphatidyl-ethanolamin) conjugate. Atg8 is a soluble cytoplasmic protein that must be first proteolysed by Atg4 to enter the conjugation system. After maturation by Atg4, Atg8 is activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7, and then transferred to the E2-like enzyme Atg3. Finally, Atg8 is covalently linked to PE. This conjugate is present in both sides of the autophagosomes and seems fundamental for its completion. After autophagosome completion, the Atg8 molecules present at the cytoplasmic face of this structure are recycled after cleavage by Atg4 and the remaining Atg8 proteins present in the inner membrane of autophagosomes are degraded after fusion with lysosomes. There are several orthologs of Atg8 in mammalian cells: MAP-LC3, GATE-16 and GABARAP, each representing a different subfamily [27] . Among these proteins, MAP-LC3 is the best characterised one and represents the most useful marker for autophagosome identification [28, 29] . In addition, there are four mammalian orthologs of Atg4, called autophagins, but only autophagin 1 (also called hAtg4B) cleaves specifically Atg8 and its different mammalian orthologs [30, 31] .",

The mTOR pathway inhibits autophagy in response to Class I PI3K and amino acids. The eIF-2\u03b1 kinases are positive regulators of autophagy in response to starvation, ER stress and viral infection. Autophagy triggering is dependent on the Class III PI3K signalling and on two conjugation systems. First, a pre-autophagosome is formed and sequesters cytoplasmic material. Its completion leads to autophagosome formation that fuses with lysosome to form autolysosome where the sequestered material is degraded far identified, is necessary for the formation of the PAS but is absent in the mature autophagosomes [34] . mAtg9, the human ortholog of the yeast Atg9 has been shown to traffic between the Golgi and endosomes, suggesting an involvement of the Golgi complex in the autophagic pathway [35] .",

Before fusing with lysosomes, autophagosomes can also fuse with endosomes to form amphisomes, making a direct connection between the endo-lysosomal and autophagic pathways [36] . Membrane fusion can be delineated into different steps: tethering, docking and fusion of the membrane bilayers. Tethering and docking events are facilitated by multi-protein complexes, and the specificity of the events is provided by GTPases from the Rab family. In particular, the GTPase Rab7 is required for the final maturation of late autophagic vacuoles and thus for the progression of the autophagic process [37, 38] . Fusion is driven by assembly of pairs of membrane proteins called SNAREs on each fusion partner [39] . Using bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase), it has been shown that acidification of the lumenal space of autophagosomes or lysosomes by V-ATPase is an important step for the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes [40] .",

This event requires the acidic pH of the lysosome to efficiently break the inner membrane of the autolysosome. In yeast, the involvement of the lipase Atg15, which is delivered to the vacuole through the multivesicular bodies, is required for vesicle breakdown [41] . After degradation of the sequestered material, the constituents are recycled through lysosomal transporters toward the cytosol. Recently, the yeast protein Atg22 has been shown to mediate the Conjugation systems involved in autophagy. The first conjugation system mediates the formation of the conjugate Atg12/ Atg5. Atg12 is activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7, and then Atg12 is transferred to the E2-like enzyme Atg10. Finally, Atg12 is covalently linked to a specific lysine of Atg5. Then, the conjugate Atg12/Atg5 interacts non-covalently with Atg16 (Atg16L in mammals) to trigger homo-oligomerization leading to a macromolecular complex necessary for the formation of autophagosomes. This structure is associated with the outer side of the autophagosomes in formation and dissociates from the membranes before the autophagosome completion. The second conjugation system results in the formation of the Atg8/PE (phosphatidyl-ethanolamin) conjugate. Atg8 (LC3 in mammals) is first proteolysed by Atg4, activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7, and then transferred to the E2-like enzyme Atg3. Finally, Atg8 is covalently linked to PE. This conjugate is present in both sides of the autophagosomes and seems fundamental for its completion. The two conjugation systems are connected: The Atg5/Atg12-Atg16 complex is necessary for the formation of the second conjugate. Over-expression of Atg10 facilitates the maturation of MAP-LC3, over-expression of Atg3 facilitates the conjugation of Atg12 to Atg5, and excess amount of the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate inhibits the MAP-LC3 maturation efflux of leucine and other amino acids resulting from autophagic degradation [42] .",

The cascade upstream mTOR includes class I PI3K and Akt, whereas the phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) acts antagonistically to the class I PI3K to induce autophagy. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, activates autophagy whereas amino acids are inhibitors of this process.

A good example to illustrate this aspect is the demonstration of the role of autophagy during the early neonatal starvation period.

It has been shown that autophagy is up-regulated in various tissues during this period, and those mice incompetent for autophagy (Atg5 knock-out mice) die within 1 day after birth [54] . In addition, autophagy has been shown to play a critical role in maintaining cellular bioenergetics and survival during growth factor deprivation in cells incompetent for apoptosis [55] .

Autophagic cell death can be distinguished from apoptosis (type I PCD) by morphological criteria, i.e. the presence of autophagosomes in dying cells. Cell death with autophagic features can occur in cells lacking critical apoptosis executioners, indicating that autophagy can compensate for defect apoptosis [57] . Autophagic cell death has also been described after treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs [58] . However, cell death, characterised by hallmarks of both type I PCD and type II PCD, is frequently observed; thus, making a clear-cut difference between them is difficult [59] [60] [61] [62] .",

These structures are composed of double-membranes and contain markers of the entire secretory pathway, including the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes. This suggests that these double-membrane structures originate from a process analogous to the formation of autophagic vacuoles [84] . More recently, MAP-LC3 and LAMP-1 have been found localised in poliovirus-and rhinovirus-induced vesicles in infected cells. More precisely, the co-expression of two poliovirus-encoded proteins called 2BC and 3A triggers MAP-LC3 and LAMP1 co-localization. Moreover, inhibition of the autophagic process using siRNA directed against the autophagic proteins LC3 and Atg12 decreases both intracellular and extracellular virus yield. The authors suggested that poliovirus and rhinovirus infection induce the formation of autophagosome-like structures to serve as membrane scaffolds for RNA replication and to inhibit their maturation into degradative organelles [85] . Because of the presence of both LC3 and the poliovirus capsid protein VP1 in extracellular structures adjacent to poliovirus-infected cells, Jackson et al. speculate that viral particles may be released by a non-lytic pathway using autophagosome-like vesicles. It has also been suggested that autophagosomes, which can become single-membraned upon maturation, provide a mechanism for the non-lytic release of cytoplasmic viruses and possibly other cytoplasmic material [86] . Very recently, the Arf family of small GTPases, which controls secretory trafficking, has been shown to associate with the newly formed membrane structures used for viral RNA replication after poliovirus infection [87] .",

HIV-1 infection usually leads to progressive decline in functionality and number of CD4 T lymphocytes, resulting in AIDS development [88] . As early as 1991, apoptosis has been proposed as a possible Use of autophagy proteins for the expression of viral proteins mechanism responsible for CD4 T cell depletion in patients infected with HIV-1, and an extensive body of literature since then has supported this hypothesis [89] . In HIV-1infected patients, both infected and uninfected cells undergo accelerated apoptosis, in vitro and in vivo. However, HIV-1-induced apoptosis in bystander uninfected immune cells is likely the major event leading to the depletion of CD4 T lymphocytes since the degree of cell loss largely exceeds the number of infected cells. Furthermore, the vast majority of T cells undergoing apoptosis in peripheral blood and lymph nodes of HIV patients are uninfected [90] . HIV-1 infection is mediated by the binding of envelope glycoproteins (Env) to the receptor CD4 and a co-receptor, mainly CCR5 or CXCR4. Notably, binding of Env, expressed on HIV-1-infected cells, to CXCR4, triggers apoptosis of uninfected CD4 T cells. Very recently, we have demonstrated that, independently of HIV-1 replication, Env-transfected or HIV-1-infected cells that express Env at the cell surface induce autophagy and accumulation of Beclin 1 in uninfected CD4 T lymphocytes, process dependent on the presence of CXCR4. Moreover, autophagy is a prerequisite to Env-induced apoptosis in uninfected bystander T cells, and CD4 T cells still undergo an Envmediated cell death with autophagic features when apoptosis is inhibited [62, 91] . To the best of our knowledge, these findings represent the first example of autophagy triggered through binding of viral envelope proteins on target cells, without viral replication, and leading to apoptosis. At present, we do not know the significance of Env-induced Beclin 1 accumulation in CD4 T cell death and if autophagy has a role in HIV-1-replication, and these points are currently under investigation in the laboratory. It has been shown that HIV-1 uses cytoplasmic late endosomal structures, identified as MVBs, for its budding step, suggesting that HIV-1 may use components of the autophagic machinery for its replication cycle [92] . In contrast, a recent study suggests that the initiating site for constitutive HIV-1 assembly and release is not the endosomal structure but the plasma membrane [93] . Thus, observation of HIV-1 particles in MVBs may be considered as a cellular defence mechanism that restricts the HIV-1 replication cycle by degrading assembled virions.",

To explore the role of Bcl-2 in this context, a yeast two-hybrid screen has been performed and has permitted to identify the autophagic protein Beclin 1 as a Bcl-2 interacting protein in infected cells. The brains of mice infected with a recombinant virus that expresses Beclin 1 show fewer Sindbis virus RNA-positive cells, fewer apoptotic cells, and lower viral titers than the brains of mice infected with recombinant viruses that express a Beclin 1 protein deleted in its Bcl-2 interacting domain, or Beclin 1 containing a premature stop codon.

They are the cause of many domesticated animal diseases and are responsible for up to 30% of human colds. A new human coronavirus has recently been identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which belongs to the coronavirus family, is frequently used to study the formation and function of the viral replication complexes. These complexes present a punctate perinuclear localisation and their number and size increase over the course of infection. Moreover, MHV RNA replication occurs on cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicles whose membranes are issued from the rough endoplasmic reticulum [99] . The co-localization of late endosomal proteins and LC3 with viral RNA-replication proteins on these membranes argues for their derivation from the autophagic pathway [99] . Importantly, the formation of autophagosome-like structures seems beneficial for MHV viral production. Indeed, the yield of extracellular virus is diminished 1,000-fold in clonal isolates of Atg5\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic stem cells. In addition, expression of ectopic Atg5 in these cells restores the wild-type yield [99] . These results demonstrate that Atg5, which is crucial for the autophagic pathway, is required for the production of infectious MHV virions. In consequences, the autophagic pathway may be required for the formation of double-membrane-bound MHV replication complexes and, by this way, may significantly enhance the efficiency of replication. However, the exact role of Atg5 in this process is not fully determined. It would be interesting to know if Atg5 benefits to MHV only by inducing the formation of autophagic membranes or if it has a more specific function in the viral replication cycle.",

It has been first associated with the antiviral action of IFNs [105] . It can be activated by dsRNA, a common intermediate in the replication of many viruses [106] . After interaction with dsRNA, PKR undergoes conformational changes that trigger its autophosphorylation and thus its activation. The major substrate of PKR is the \u03b1-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis [107] . However, PKR can be activated without viral dsRNA or viral infection by different stresses or through protein-protein interactions. For instance, PKR can be activated by interacting with the protein PKR activating protein (PACT), leading to apoptosis [108] .",

Atg12 is activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7, and then Atg12 is transferred to the E2-like enzyme Atg10. Finally, Atg12 is covalently linked to a specific lysine of Atg5. Then, the conjugate Atg12/Atg5 interacts non-covalently with Atg16 (Atg16L in mammals) to trigger homo-oligomerization leading to a macromolecular complex necessary for the formation of autophagosomes. This structure is associated with the outer side of the autophagosomes in formation and dissociates from the membranes before the autophagosome completion. The second conjugation system results in the",
