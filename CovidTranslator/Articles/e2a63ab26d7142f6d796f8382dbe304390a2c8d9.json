Here we report viruslike particles found in intestine epithelium of sea cucumbers reared in North China. It is the first time that sea cucumbers are reported to be infected by virus. Histological examinations showed that the viral inclusion bodies existed in intestine epithelium cells. Electron microscopic examinations show that the virions were spherical, 80-100 nm in diameter, and composed of a helical nucleocapsid within an envelope with surface projections. Detailed studies on the morphogenesis of these viruses found many characteristics previously described for coronaviruses. Virus particles always congregated, and formed a virus vesicle with an encircling membrane. The most obvious cellular pathologic feature is large granular areas of cytoplasm, relatively devoid of organelles. Tubular structures within virus-containing vesicles, nucleocapsid inclusions, and double-membrane vesicles are also found in the cytopathic cells. No rickettsia, chlamydia, bacteria, or other parasitic organisms were found.",

Outside the virus-containing vesicles, but always adjacent to the vesicles, there occurred another kind of tubular structures, averaging 15 nm in diameter. Some of these linear structures were arrayed at low density (Fig. 4a) and some of them were dense compactly, and orderly (Fig. 4b) . Intestinal villi arranged irregularly and the epithelium layer obviously damaged or even disappeared (arrowhead) accompanied with empty areas for histolysis (arrow). Bar, 50 lm. (b) Viral inclusion bodies were observed in epithelium layer. The size of these obviously spherical inclusion bodies ranges between 0.6 and 1 lm, stained purple (arrow). Bar, 3 lm. Orderly tubular structures can also be found around the vesicles. Bar, 50 nm. Inset: a typical virus particle, with an envelope and regular petal-like surface projections (arrow) surrounding the periphery of the particle. Bar, 100 nm. Additional cytoplasmic structures associated with virus infections were double-membrane vesicles, which have been similarly noted in coronavirus-infected cells (Dubois et al., 1982; Gosert et al., 2002) . In contrast, double-membrane vesicles in cytopthic cells of sea cucumber with APED, typically were composed of accumulations of multiple single-membrane vesicles enclosed within an outer membrane (Fig. 5a) , and virus particles were sometimes located between the two membranes. On the other hand, vesicles with tight double-membranes were also found in cytopathic cells of sea cucumber with APED, and their formation seems probably associated with the varicose rough endoplasmic reticula (Fig. 5b) .",

Therefore the frozen section technology was used for the fast detection of these viral infections in our epidemiology and diagnostic study. As to the apply of TEM to discover agents, with SARS, as with previous investigations of outbreaks involving such viruses as Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, and more recently, monkey pox, TEM played an essential role (Goldsmith et al., 2004) .

As has been reported, the cells of invertebrates cannot be cultured, and the viruses of invertebrates cannot be replicated in vitro (Deuff and Renault, 1999) . Only minimal intestine tissue can be obtained as material when the disease occurs, because of the sea cucumbers' peculiar evisceration. Therefore it is difficult to purify viruses from infected tissues. We have tried to purify the viral particles by sucrose gradient centrifugation of homogenates from intestine tissues. Unfortunately, to date, we have not obtained the viruses pure enough for infection experiments, nor for sequencing the viral genome. Currently primary culture of intestine epithelium are being tried to obtain enough viruses for future research.",

From the severe traumas among virus-infected cells, it can be concluded that these sea cucumbers are not the natural hosts, but suffer as victims infected from other hosts. Even worse is that these viruses were also observed in the diseased larvae of sea cucumbers (1 mm), which were just 30 days old. In June of 2006, epidemic disease broke out during the seed cultivation in North China and caused 80% mortality. Similar viruses were observed replicated at high numbers in cytopathic cells, and causing severe pathological changes. That observation suggests that the viruses may now be transmitted vertically from the parents, even though the first infection and origin have not been confirmed yet. Now it seems less important for us to find the origin of these viruses, but to select uninfected parent sea cucumbers for brood stock cultivation.",
