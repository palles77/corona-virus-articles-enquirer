As of 3 March 2020, there have been 80270 confirmed cases and 2981 deaths in China, most of which are from the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan City, the capital of Hubei Province. New COVID-19 cases have been steadily declining in China and more than 60000 patients have been recovered 4 , largely due to the effective implementation of comprehensive control measures in China 5, 6 . Here we report that some of these measures, such as a dramatic and timely increase of medical supplies, may play a critical role such that the mortality and recovery rates of COVID-19 in Wuhan follow exponential decay and growth modes, respectively.",

Results also show that the number of acute care beds from more than 45 designated hospitals plus two newly built ones in Wuhan has been consecutively increasing up to 23 532 (as of Feb 24) under the government-directed re-allocation (Fig. 1D) . This supply thus enabled the severe and critical patients to be treated timely and effectively 6 . More importantly, there have been over 10 temporary hospitals (named Fangcang hospitals) reconstructed from gymnasium and exhibition centers, which provide more than 26 000 makeshift beds for mild patients (Fig. 1D) . These combinations guaranteed nearly 100% percent of COVID-19 patients to be treated in hospitals even if the number of remaining confirmed cases has ten-fold increased up to 38 000 on 18 Feb (Fig. 1D) . In contrast, a lot of patients had to stay at home in the early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan due to the shortage of beds such that many transmissions in households occurred 6 . Accordingly, the effective implementation of comprehensive control measures and infection-treatment practices is critical for combatting any new pathogens, not only interrupting the transmissions but also saving the patients. Timely supplied medical resources, including re-allocation of acute care beds, rapid construction of new hospitals and generous aid of health workers by other less-severe areas, apparently help the epicenter of the outbreak Hubei (Wuhan) to accomplish a unique and also encouraging outcome for life-saving such that the mortality and recovery rates of nearly 50 000 COVID-19 patients exponentially decays and grows, respectively. Other crucial factors contributing to this success may include the improved and optimized diagnosis and treatment strategies 8 , which are critical for saving severe and critical patients 5, 6, 9 . This speculation appears to be supported by the exponential growth of the COVID-19 recovery rate outside Hubei (Fig. 1B) where medical resources are relatively sufficient 10 . Collectively, the achievement made in Hubei (or Wuhan) may provide useful guidance for many countries to be better prepared for the potential pandemic 2 that may overwhelm local health care systems.

Parameters from the regression analyses are shown inTable S1, with R 2 being shown here. (C) Numbers of the aided health workers in Hubei over time. Ratio of the aided health workers to patients was also plotted (note: most of the aided health workers are working in Wuhan; refer toTable S3). (D) Numbers of the remaining confirmed cases of COVID-19, and acute care beds, makeshift beds from Fangcang hospitals and total beds in Wuhan over time. Ratio of beds to patients was also plotted. Here the data of newly supplied beds in Hubei are not available and thus the data for Wuhan were analyzed.",
