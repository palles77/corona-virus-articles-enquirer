In this review, we will summarize recent advances to utilize mice with human immune system components, reconstituted from hematopoietic progenitor cells in vivo. Such mice can be used to study human pathogens that replicate in leucocytes. In addition to studying the replication of these pathogens, the reconstituted human immune system components can also be analyzed for initiating immune responses and control against these infections. Moreover, these new animal models of human infectious disease should replicate the reactivity of the human immune system to vaccine candidates and, especially, the adjuvants contained in them, more faithfully.",

Among all organs, most of these differences fall into olfaction, reproduction and the immune system 1 . Many of the differences in the immune system relate to innate immunity 2 , which ensures the survival of the individual during the first days after infection until the adaptive immune response can be tailored to the specific needs of the particular challenge. Since mice and men encounter virtually non-overlapping groups of pathogens due to their occupation of different ecological niches, these have shaped the innate immune system of the two species quite differently. These differences become especially important, because the innate immune system initiates both rapid and adaptive immune responses, and, therefore, human immune system reactivity towards vaccines, pathogens and human disease causing conditions in general are difficult to model in mice. In these instances the study of human immune cells, ideally in vivo, would be preferable.",

However, only with the advent of the cytokine (IL-2, 4, 7, 9, 15 and 21) receptor common gamma chain (\u03b3 c ) knock-out into mice that already lacked T and B cells due to a scid mutation or recombinase (Rag) deficiency, it has become possible to engraft significant frequencies of cells from all human immune compartments after transfer of fetal or neonatal human hematopoetic progenitor cells (HPCs) into mice 5, 6 . In these mice enhanced engraftment is generally attributed to the lack of xenoreactivity mediated by mouse natural killer (NK) cells, which seems to originate from the loss of IL-15 signaling. Accordingly, NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/or BALB/c Rag2 -/-\u03b3 c -/mice are most often used for human immune compartment reconstitution from transplanted HPCs, even so some studies use parallel transplantation of human fetal liver, fetal thymus and HPCs into NOD-scid mice (BLT), alternatively (Figure 1 ) 7 . Mice transplanted with human HPCs are able to reconstitute 40-60% of human CD45 + mononuclear cells in peripheral blood and spleen with sizable compartments of human B cells, T cells, NK cells, monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) three month after HPC transfer (Table 1 ). In this review we will summarize studies on the immunocompetence of these reconstituted human immune system components and discuss their usefulness for studying infections by human pathogens as well as vaccination approaches against these.",

Without treatment, no NK cells could be detected in this model. However, repetitive treatment with various cytokine/growth factor combinations lead to a transient increase of NK cells within the reconstituted mice lasting 3 weeks 8 . Of note, all cytokine combinations that led to development of human NK cells in vivo, contained IL-15 and flt3 ligand. Human NK cell frequencies (frequency of CD56 + cells among human CD45 + lymphocytes) of 4 to 5% could be achieved in bone marrow and spleen, and even higher percentages of more than 10% in peripheral blood. A CD3 + CD56 + NKT cell population was not induced upon treatment, as CD56 + cells were reported to be CD3 -. The phenotype of the NK cells found in this study was mostly CD56 dim KIRwith CD16 expressed on 50 to 70% of all CD56 + NK cells. NK cells isolated from bone marrow of these cytokine treated mice produced IFN-\u03b3 after additional in vitro stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18, albeit at much lower frequencies when compared to equally stimulated NK cells from human peripheral blood. Interestingly, when in vitro expanded NK cells isolated from reconstituted mice were adoptively transferred into non-reconstituted NOD-scid recipients challenged with K562 tumor cells, a significant decrease of tumor burden was observed (the K562 cell line is a MHC-I deficient erythroleukemic cell line). This study suggests that functional human NK cells can be reconstituted in such mice, but require additional activation by cytokines to maintain their functionality.",

These human NK cells could be divided into the two main subsets present in humans -CD56 bright CD16 -KIRand CD56 dim CD16 + KIR + NK cells -with the latter, irrespective of localization, representing the majority. This, however, is in contrast to the distribution of these two subsets in man, where there are remarkable differences in subset ratio in different organs 10 . Of interest, NK cells almost devoid of CD56 expression could also be detected. These cells were of NK cell origin, as they expressed the NK cell specific marker NKp46 11 as well as NKG2D, CD94, and KIRs. The human NK cell compartment in this model was functional. IFN-\u03b3 secretion after IL-12/-15/-18 stimulation ex vivo and degranulation in response to co-culture with the NK cell susceptible erythroleukemia cell line K562 in the presence of IL-15 could be detected. A direct comparison to NK cell effector functions observed in human samples was not provided. The authors of this study furthermore report an expansion of the human NK cell compartment shortly after the repeated administration of IL-15 or IL-15/IL-15R\u03b1 hybrid molecules. This happened at the expense of a skewing towards a more differentiated CD56 dim CD16 + phenotype, converting nearly all NK cells to a CD16 + population with accompanying acquisition of KIR expression. The duration of this increase in NK cell frequency after IL-15 treatment was not reported. Along these lines two other studies compared NK cell reconstitution in BALB/c Rag2 -/-\u03b3 c -/mice after neonatal injection with cord blood CD34 + cells to reconstitution of this compartment upon HPC transfer into NODscid and C57BL/6 Rag2 -/-\u03b3 c -/mice 12, 13 . In the latter, CD45 + cell development did not occur at all 12 . In reconstituted BALB/c Rag2 -/-\u03b3 c -/mice, the highest frequencies of CD56 + cells were detected in lymph nodes, but the majority of these cells also expressed the T cell marker CD3 12 . Further analysis of CD3 -CD56 + NK cells showed that NK cells in the lymph node were virtually devoid of CD16 expression 13 . In the spleen, CD3 -CD56 + NK cells were CD16whereas in the blood most NK cells expressed CD16 12 . Administration of an adenoviral vector encoding human IL-15 led to the expression of CD16 and KIRs on almost all splenic NK cells and to a significant increase in the frequency of CD56 + cells in the spleen to around 2% (% of CD45 + cells) 24h after administration 13 . These data suggest that significant NK cell frequencies can only be achieved after HPC transfer into BALB/c Rag2 -/-\u03b3 c -/mice with additional supplementation with IL-15 and that terminal differentiation of NK cells from CD56 bright CD16 -NK cells can be achieved by the application of this cytokine.",

An expansion of NK cells in blood, spleen, bone marrow, liver and lung similar to the above mentioned was reported by Chen et al. after hydrodynamic injection of plasmids encoding for human IL-15 and flt3 ligand 14 . Frequencies of CD3 -CD56 + NK cells of more than 10% (among human CD45 + cells) were detected one week after gene delivery with a steady decline to still elevated levels over an observational period of 30 days. Nine days after hydrodynamic injection of IL-15 and flt3 ligand encoding plasmids, the absolute NK cell number per spleen was as high as 2 \u00d7 10 6 . Of note, the administration of IL-15 and flt3 ligand encoding plasmids led to an overall increase of CD45 + cells content in spleen (above 20 \u00d7 10 6 ) and bone marrow with concomitant increases in DC, monocyte/macrophage, B cell and T cell numbers. Apparently, the cytokine-induced NK cell expansion did not occur at the expense of a loss of the more immature CD16 -KIRphenotype, as the majority of NK cells in bone marrow and spleen did not express CD16 or KIR molecules. However, a direct comparison to the NK cell compartment in reconstituted NSG mice without treatment was not conducted. NK cells isolated from bone marrow and spleen of reconstituted NSG mice treated with cytokine-encoding plasmids were able to specifically lyse K562 tumor cells in vitro and produced IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of poly(I:C) and autologous human dendritic cells (DCs). IFN-\u03b3 levels were also increased in sera of cytokine treated mice after in vivo poly(I:C) stimulation.",

Recently, our group reported robust and stable overall NK cell reconstitution in NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice, neonatally reconstituted with CD34 + human fetal liver HPCs by intrahepatic injection 15 . This model allowed multilineage reconstitution with CD45 + frequencies in peripheral blood of 60%. NK cell numbers in the spleen were on average 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells with frequencies ranging from 1.7 to 3.4%. In peripheral blood of these mice, NK cells represented on average 5% of human lymphocytes. NK cells were detected in all organs analyzed, with the lowest frequency in the bone marrow. The analysis of the human NK cell compartment demonstrated development of all NK cell subsets present in human cord blood. Interestingly, a CD3 -NKp46 + CD56 -NK cell subset was found that also exists in human cord blood but is present only at very low frequencies in human adult blood. This subset upregulated CD56 expression in vivo when transferred into autologously reconstituted NSG mice as well as in vitro in the presence of IL-15. In comparison to PBMC derived NK cells, a decreased functional capacity of NK cells from both mice with human immune system components and cord blood was detected. This deficit was mainly confined to the CD56 dim and the NKp46 + CD56 -NK cell subsets. Importantly, pre-activation of the human NK cell compartment from reconstituted mice and from human cord blood with IL-15 in vitro or poly(I:C) in vivo rendered these NK cells capable of secreting IFN-\u03b3 and degranulating in response to the target cell line K562. Levels of activation were similar to human adult peripheral blood NK cells. In addition, preactivation with poly(I:C) in vivo led to enhanced killing of MHC-class I negative tumor cells compared to parental MHC-class I expressing tumor cells. These studies demonstrate that functionally competent NK cells can be reconstituted to half of the human physiological frequencies after neonatal HPC transfer into newborn NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice. Cellular frequencies can be further expanded by activation with IL-15.",

This is due to the fact that DCs and monocytes/macrophages are only found at low frequencies after reconstitution in immune compromised mice (3% human myeloid cells among CD45 + leucocytes, and around 1% DCs, barely detectable levels of granulocytes). One study reported the presence of CD15 + neutrophils in the bone marrow at a frequency of 4% at 8 to 12 weeks after reconstitution of newborn NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice 17 . The same group also characterized delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in these mice after repeated challenge with trinitrobenzenesulfonate (TNBS). Administration of IL-7 prior to immunization augmented this response, suggesting the existence of an intact innate and adaptive immune system involving macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells. When using keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a DTH response inducing antigen in reconstituted NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice, T cells and macrophages infiltrated the site of injection, but no swelling could be observed 18 . In a model using parallel transplantation of liver, thymus and HPC components into NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice, DTH responses to tetanus toxoid and collagen V could be elicited with swelling and an influx of human CD3 + T cells, CD68 + macrophages and mouse Ly6G + leukocytes at the site of injection 19 . Furthermore, administration of the superantigen toxicshock-syndrome-toxin-1 into classical BLT mice led to a marked increase in cytokines, an expansion of specific TCR V\u03b22 + T cells and the upregulation of maturation and activation markers on CD11c + DCs 7 . Moreover, our group could prime antigen-specific T and B cell responses in a vaccination study targeting human DCs in NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice with human immune system components 20 . These studies suggest functionality of myeloid cells and DCs during T cell priming, DTH and superantigen driven immune reactions. Mice reconstituted with human immune system components might therefore be a useful tool to evaluate DC targeted vaccine candidates.",

Since this cellular subset of human lymphocytes poorly reconstitutes and survives in the xenogeneic mouse environment, experimental studies on EBV immune control in mice have long been limited. As early as 1990 it was shown that transfer of PBMC from healthy EBV carriers to scid mice leads to the development of tumors that in many aspects resemble EBV driven lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) 32 . However, the poor survival of human T cells within the transferred PBMCs did not allow any assessment of T cell mediated immune control. Nevertheless, autologous ex vivo expanded EBV specific CTLs did home to sites of tumor formation in this model and specifically killed infected tumor cells 33 . The first mouse strain allowing direct EBV infection in mice after reconstitution with human immune cells was the NOD-scid mouse 34 . Upon injection of HPCs, human B cells develop in these animals and can be infected with EBV by injection of virus containing culture supernatants. 4-6 weeks after infection mice showed disseminated LPD and high titers of viral DNA could be detected in peripheral blood. Like most EBV driven tumors found to date in mice with human immune system components, these tumors expressed EBER, LMP1 and EBNA2, thereby indicating latency III. Residual mouse NK cell activity in NOD-scid mice, however, limits the development of human T cells and thereby hampers attempts to analyze T cell mediated immune control.",

In a seminal publication Traggiai et al. could show stable human T-cell homeostasis in BALB/c Rag2 -/-\u03b3 c -/mice reconstituted with human HPCs 6 . These T cells expand upon EBV infection. Since, similar to primary EBV infection in humans, the vast majority of expanding T cells are CD8 + T cells, this induces an inversion of the CD4 + T cells / CD8 + T cells ratio in the spleen. T cells isolated from infected mice produce IFN-\u03b3 when stimulated with autologous LCLs, thereby proving in vivo T cell priming. Similar findings were also reported using BLT and NODscid \u03b3 c -/mice 7, 35 . The latter mouse strain has been used by our group and others to further characterize EBV infection and immune control in reconstituted mice. EBV infection in these mice shows a dose dependent effect. Low dose infection (10 4 Raji infectious units) leads to T cell reactivities against LCLs and asymptomatic EBV persistence. In contrast, intermediate and high dose EBV infection (10 5 and 10 6 RIU, respectively) results in a stronger expansion of EBV specific T cells and especially high dose infection even results in EBV driven tumor formation. Expanded T cells furthermore show direct cytotoxicity against autologous LCL and their EBV-epitope specificity could be identified by peptide stimulation. Among expanded T cells, high frequencies of CD45RO + and HLA-DR + cells can be detected, indicating an activated, memory T cell like phenotype 36, 35 . Research from our group demonstrated that the observed priming of EBV specific T cells is of protective value 36 . Depletion of human T cells prior to EBV infection resulted in the development of disseminated LPD and higher viral DNA loads in the spleen of infected animals at early time points after infection. Of note, CD4 + T cell depletion alone as well as sole CD8 + T cell depletion lead to a significant increase in viral DNA load. Yajima et al. who reported a more rapid onset of LPD and a shorter lifespan in reconstituted EBV infected mice after T cell depletion, confirmed the protective value of T cells in this system 37 .",

This unphysiological selection process, which includes selection on human MHC as well as on mouse H2 molecules, seems to result in different affinities and specificities than T cells selection in an all-human setting. This might explain why the detected T cell specificities were mostly directed against subdominant EBV epitopes. Such limitations can be overcome by the introduction of human HLA transgenes into the mouse genome. After insertion of a human HLA-A2 heavy chain transgene into NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice (NSG-A2 mice) immuno-dominant peptide specificities against EBV lytic and latent antigens can be detected at relatively high frequencies 36, 38 .",

It primes protective antiviral T cell responses in a dose-dependent manner and primed T cells recognize EBV derived epitopes that can also be found in human EBV carriers. At higher viral doses, EBV can cause LPD formation and by their expression of latent EBV proteins, these LPDs resemble tumors that are normally found in immunocompromised patients.",

They are transmitted by mosquito bites and global incidence has increased drastically over the past decades, especially in Asia. Infection can lead to a flu-like disease called dengue fever (DF). Symptoms range from mild to severe and include fever, rash, headache, nausea and vomiting as well as muscle and joint pain. The cellular basis and contribution of the host's immune system to disease are not understood in detail. In some cases and especially after secondary infection with another serotype, patients develop dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) with thrombocytopenia and plasma leakage, which can be fatal. To date, there is no specific antiviral treatment or licensed vaccine available partly due to the lack of an appropriate animal model. Nonhuman primates support productive infection, but they do not show symptoms of DF or DHF. Several mouse models have been used to study aspects of DENV infection in the past, however the relevance of the results for the human setting is limited. Infectious doses were un-physiologically high or the mice were not fully immunocompetent. Furthermore, mousebrain-adapted virus strains were used or virus was injected into the CNS directly. To overcome some of these limitations, Bente and al. infected NOD-scid mice reconstituted with CD34 + cord blood cells with DENV serotype 2 subcutaneously to mimic mosquito bites. Mice developed symptoms associated with DF like an increase in body temperature, rash and thrombocytopenia 43 . Mota and Rico-Hesse used reconstituted NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice to compare the severity of these symptoms induced by different strains of DENV serotype 2 after a low dose, s.c. injection. In accordance with experiments in human target cells, a southeast Asian strain was the most virulent one in this mouse model. It was also the only strain that induced the production of DENV-specific antibodies 44 . Also reconstituted Rag2 -/-\u03b3 c -/mice support DENV infection. Similarly, they develop fever, but unlike reconstituted NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice, they do not display signs of rash or hemorrhage after combined i.p. and s.c. DENV injection. They did, however, generate DENV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies, which in part had neutralizing capacity 45 . It is also possible to generate a DENV-specific T cell response in reconstituted mice. When Jaiswal et al. infected HLA-A2 transgenic NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice reconstituted with HLA-A2 positive HPCs, they detected T cells that secreted IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 or TNF-\u03b1 after restimulation with a DENV peptide pool 46 .",

            "text": "HIV-Despite all efforts, infection with human immunodefciency virus (HIV) and the resulting immunodeficiency are still a major threat to global health. In 2008, 2.7 million people were newly infected with HIV, with a total of 33.4 million people being HIVpositive worldwide (WHO). The most common form of transmission is by sexual intercourse. In the acute phase of infection, HIV levels in plasma peak. Subsequently, HIV levels drop, most likely due to a CD8 + T cell response that eliminates infected cells. The major target cells are CD4 + T cells, but also monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells can be infected. In the latent phase of infection, the human immune system controls viral infection, resulting in low viral levels in plasma. Over time, CD4 + T cell levels decrease causing the immune system to lose functionality. This gives rise to opportunistic infections and cancer development that eventually will cause death. Combined antiretroviral therapy delays disease progression, but there is no cure or vaccine available to date. Major problems pose the integration of the viral DNA into the host DNA for long-term viral persistence and the high mutation rate of the virus facilitating immune evasion. Furthermore, we lack a suitable animal model to study HIV infection and to test new antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. Experiments in chimpanzees, macaques, cats, rats and mice have allowed insights into several aspects of HIV biology 47 . However, HIV pathogenesis in these models as well as the resulting immune response differs from human infection. To overcome these problems, several mouse models with reconstituted human immune system components have been tested to date. Early experiments were carried out in scid mice with a human fetal thymus and liver transplant (SCID-hu thy/liv mice). HIV isolates could infect T cells and thymocytes in the engrafted human thymus of these mice and infection lead to T cell depletion 48, 49, 50, 51 . Therefore, this model allows in vivo drug testing and the study of viral cytopathogenicity. The major limitation is the lack of a complete immune system with circulating lymphocytes and human antigen presenting cells. In contrast, more cellular compartments can engraft in scid mice, when transplanted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (SCID-hu-PBL). Nevertheless, this model mainly allows the analysis of the acute phase of infection and the evaluation of antiretroviral therapy, as also here CD4 + T cell depletion is rapid and T cells are not replenished 52, 53 .",

All models support viral infection with viremia in the plasma, show dissemination of the virus to various organs and exhibit CD4 + T cell depletion 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 . Most importantly, all these reconstituted mice mount at least weak immune responses to HIV. Several groups detected a humoral immune response, however at low frequencies. For example, Baenziger et al. reported one IgG producing mouse after HIV infection in reconstituted Rag2 -/-\u03b3 c -/mice 54 . Three out of 14 reconstituted NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice produced antibodies that were specific for env gp120 or gag p24 57 . In the same mouse background, Sato et al. found IgG in seven out of seven infected mice (data shown for two), which were in part specific for gp41 62 . One reason for a higher IgG frequency in this study might be the long period of time between infection and analysis. Also the majority of infected BLT mice generated HIV-specific antibodies with epitopes including gag, nef, pol and env after prolonged time periods of infection 63 . In addition to a late time point for analysis, having a human thymus in BLT mice might allow the generation of more potent T helper cells and thereby more frequent antibody responses.",

In addition, they detected HIV-specific T cell responses nine weeks post infection. CD4 + as well as CD8 + T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 after ex vivo peptide restimulation 63 . Interestingly, gag and nef were the most frequently recognized T cell antigens in these mice as is the case in human HIV infected patients. Despite this robust immune response, also the BLT mice of this study did not show decreased viral load after T cell priming. One possible explanation might be emerging T cell exhaustion. As in chronic human infection, HIV lead to an increase in frequency and expression levels of PD-1 on CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in BLT mice. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the percentage of PD-1 positive cells and plasma viremia 63 , which supports this hypothesis.",

In a nasopharyngeal carcinoma trial using ex vivo generated DCs pulsed with peptides derived from EBV proteins, expansion of EBV-specific CD8 + cytotoxic T cells could be detected. Clinically, however, no remission or slowing of tumor growth could be observed 78 . This data indicates that it is crucial to test whether the primary T cell responses elicited in vitro will confer protection against virally transformed cells and tumors in vivo. As EBV specific T cell responses limit viremia and tumor formation during infection in reconstituted NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/mice 36, 37 , this particular mouse model seems suitable to test vaccine candidates that aim to induce protective T cell responses. Along these lines, we tested vaccination with an EBNA1 fusion antibody targeting the endocytic DEC-205 receptor on human dendritic cells together with the application of a TLR3/mda5 agonist as adjuvant in such reconstituted mice. In response, they elicited EBNA1-specifc T cell response as well as anti-EBNA1 antibodies 20 . However, the observed levels of T cell reactivity in most vaccinated mice were tenfold lower than the levels of reactivity observed during intermediate dose EBV infection 36 . Therefore, these encouraging results will need further improvement before vaccinated mice can be challenged with high dose EBV infections. Such improvements might include selection of more efficient adjuvant formulations to boost dendritic cell maturation for more efficient T cell priming after antigen has been targeted to them.",

The virus envelope has evolved to evade neutralizing antibodies and continuous mutations of the virus are enabling it to evade anti-HIV T cell responses 80 . Two highly publicized HIV vaccine trials were prematurely terminated due to a high frequency of seroconversions among vaccine recipients, indicating non-effectiveness of the vaccine 81 . With these disappointing results, there has been increased interest in rodent models with human immune system components for HIV infection in order to test preclinical vaccine candidates. Earlier studies using SCID-hu-PBL mouse models showed that high doses of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody IgG1b12 can block viral entry and thereby can protect the host from developing high plasma viremia 82, 83 . However, the transferred PBMCs in this mouse model did not sustain T cell reconstitution and, therefore, HIV-1 infection. Over time, such mice furthermore suffer from a severe (xeno-) graft versus host disease (GvHD), due to high xenoreacitivy of the transplanted human PBMCs against the murine host's cells. Rag2 -/-\u03b3 c -/-, NOD-scid \u03b3 c -/and BLT mice, on the contrary, support long-lasting and robust in situ development of human hematopoietic cells, relevant to HIV infection 54, 57, 59 .

This model was for example used to test an adenoviral cancer vaccine to human carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) 86 . Camacho et al. demonstrated that engrafted human lymphocytes responded to the cancer vaccine by producing IFN-\u03b3 when the restimulated in vitro with CEA peptides. However, the protective value of the induced T cell responses was not explored and even na\u00efve, but fully educated human T cells might raise xenoreactive immune responses towards their mouse host over time, thereby at least in part contributing to the observed T cells activation. In newborn mice transplanted with human HPCs, developing human lymphocytes are tolerized against mouse tissue due to their selection in the mouse thymus. Therefore, these models might be more favourable for vaccine studies.",

Furthermore, a recent study showed that NOD-scid \u03b22m -/mice engrafted with adult human CD34 + HPCs and further reconstituted with human T cells, can mount specific immune responses against influenza virus vaccines 87 . Influenza matrix protein 1-specific CD8 + T cells were expanded in mice vaccinated with inactivated trivalent influenza virus vaccine. The expansion of these antigen-specific CD8 + T cells required reconstitution of the human myeloid compartment. Nevertheless, the protective value of this vaccine response against influenza virus infection was not investigated in this study.",

These mouse models can serve as tools to study infection and to some extent immune control of human pathogens in vivo. While innate immune responses and T cell responses can probably be modelled fairly well, the lack of steady-state germinal center formation and the associated defect in isotype switching and affinity maturation of humoral human immune responses, will probably limit the usefulness of these new models against pathogens that require antibody mediated neutralization for immune control. However, these models might be rather suitable to study pathogens like EBV that are primarily controlled by T cell mediated immunity. Furthermore, vaccine development that aims to primarily evaluate antigen plus adjuvant candidates for improved T cell immunity might be advanced in these mice. As pathogen associated molecular pattern recognition differs between mouse and man and strongly affects adjuvant recognition during vaccination, vaccination studies might especially benefit from these new models.",
