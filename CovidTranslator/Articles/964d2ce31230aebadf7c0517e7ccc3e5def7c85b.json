Temperature-sensitive mutants (ts mutants) induced by N-methyl-N'nitrosoguanidine and 5-fluorouracil were isolated. Twelve mutants which were able to induce the formation of syncytia at 33 \u00b0C but not at the restrictive temperature (39.5 \u00b0C) were selected for detailed study. No viral RNA synthesis was detected after infection at the restrictive temperature with six of the mutants (RNA-) whereas six others were RNA +, although they displayed RNA synthesis which was generally reduced. No differences have been detected in the size of the genome or the viral-intracellular RNA species found in wild type virus or ts mutant infected cells at permissive temperature. The pattern of virusinduced proteins analyzed after immunoprecipitation by SDS-PAGE was similar in wild type virus and RNA + mutant infected cells at 39.5 \u00b0C. Complementation experiments between ts mutants enabled us to distinguish five groups. Three of the groups contained RNA-mutants and two of them RNA +. Plaques made by mutants in one group displayed characteristic features that distinguished them from the wild type.",

The first step in MHV-3 RNA replication is the transcription of the genomic RNA into a full-length negative-stranded RNA [14] . This RNA is then transcribed into seven virusspecific mRNAs, the largest being the intracellular genomic form, and the others being the subgenomic mRNAs [5, 13, 15, 23, 25, 33] . These mRNAs have a \"nested-set\" structure such that all share identical sequences as the 3' end [22] . Various strains of MHV cause different diseases in mice depending upon the particular race, age and immune status of the animals [30] . Although the genetic structures of MHV-3 and MHV A 59 are similar [12] , only the former is highly hepatotropic. Accordingly, MHV-3 induces a fatal hepatic necrosis in susceptible mice, the characteristic feature being the destruction of the hepatocytes [8] . Before this takes place the virus interacts with the sinusoidal barrier: i.e. with Kupffer and endothelial cells [19, 24] .",

Maximum titers were reached 16 hours, 24 hours or 32 hours post infection for incubations at 33 \u00b0C, 37 \u00b0C, or 39.5 \u00b0C respectively. In order to induce mutation in the MHV-3 genome, the mutagens N-methyl-N'-nitrosoguanidine (NG) or 5-fluorouracil (FU) were used at concentrations that inhibited virus multiplication one hundred fold. Plaque isolates obtained from mutagenized stocks at 33 \u00b0C were then screened for their ability to produce syncytia at 39.5\u00b0C. Potential mutants isolated using this criterion were further characterized by the efficiency of their plaque formation at 39.5 \u00b0C and 33 \u00b0C. Only mutants, whose relative plating efficiency 39.5\u00b0C/ Temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV 3 (Fig. 1) ; in this case, the size of the plaques did not enlarge after 36 hrs. To understand this phenomenon, the yield in the medium and the yield remaining cell-associated were measured at 33 \u00b0C and 39.5 \u00b0C and compared with the yield of a non-ts small plaque mutant: E20 ( Table 2 ). The percentage of the yield obtained in the medium at 39.5 \u00b0C with mutants D 85 and E 365 was constant during infection (20 hrs and 36hrs p.i.) and close to the percentage measured for mutant E 20.

However, after a pulse-chase labelling, two forms of the proteins N were detected. The molecule of 58,000 mol wt has the same electrophoresis mobility as the phosphorylated N protein product at 39.5\u00b0C (Fig. 3) . It could also be noticed that the phosphorylation was very efficient at 39.5 \u00b0C and poor at 33 \u00b0C; such a difference in the phosphorylation rate may explain the fact that the N pp is found after a short labelling at 33 \u00b0C as a molecule of 56,000 mol wt [26] . Mutants in groups I, II, and III failed to induce the synthesis of viral polypeptides at 39.5 \u00b0C and at 37 \u00b0C only mutants in group III did not synthesize proteins whereas the others displayed a reduction in the synthesis of viral proteins.

The isolation of ts-mutants with MHV-3 appeared to be less straightforward than with other MHV strains since the stock titer of virus was usually low and on account of severe virus inactivation at the non-permissive temperature, a plaque enlargement method could not be employed. Given the low rate of spontaneous mutation, we used the mutagens NG and FU. Among the 12 ts-mutants studied, 6 exhibited complete thermosensitivity at 39.5 \u00b0C and complete (D 222, D 282, F 183) or partial thermosensitivity at 37 \u00b0C (D 224, D 265, F72). With 3 of the mutants, D85, D281, E365, the progeny at 39.5\u00b0C was considerably reduced and plaques obtained at the non-permissive temperature were usually smaller than those of the wild type. The small size of the plaques could be correlated with less efficient release of virus into the external medium. On the basis of yields obtained from mixed infections at the non-permissive temperature the mutants could be divided into five complementation groups. The 5 most thermosensitive mutants belonged to 3 complementation groups, I, II, and III. Viral RNA synthesis was defective in cells infected by these mutants at 39.5 \u00b0C (RNA--mutants). In group V the mutant F 104 began RNA synthesis earlier (at 5 hours) than the wild type virus (8 hours) and the maximum amount of progeny virus likewise appeared at an earlier time.",

The first event after infection is the translation of the 5' end of the genome into one or more polymerase molecules corresponding to the early polymerase detected by Brayton et al. [4] .

            "text": "The detection of negative strand RNA with mutants from groups I, II, and III failed using RNA-RNA hybridization with either the genomic RNA or with E 1 probe. These experiments suggest that the early polymerase was defective at the non permissive temperature. Similar results were obtained with ts mutants of MHV A 59 [R. Baric, personal communication] . In contrast to previous reports we found two RNA + complementation groups but our selection procedure based on the reduction of syncytia formation at 39.5 \u00b0C and not on plaque enlargement could pick out some mutants not fully ts with a mutation in genes not needed for RNA synthesis. With mutants in group V, the efficiency of RNA synthesis was similar at 37 \u00b0C and 39.5 \u00b0C when compared with the wild type virus, but the progeny yield was reduced by one hundred. A mutation in a gene interfering with the viral maturation could explain these results; however, it is known that the mutant virions are more rapidly inactivated at 39.5 \u00b0C than the wild type virus and this may also account for the small yield of mutants. Biochemical evidence indicates that there are at least six MHV genes expressed late in infection which are probably not required for RNA synthesis.",

The fact that, in the case of mutant D 265, viral antigens were revealed in a very small number of cells by immuofluorescence is not in contradiction with the other data as the amount of proteins produced must be extremely small and inferior to the level detectable by the immunofluorescence method. Surprisingly, some mutants of the group IV, although RNA +, synthesized viral polypeptides only poorly at 39.5 \u00b0C.",

However, the apparent molecular weight of the N polypeptide produced at 33 \u00b0C was different from those synthesized at 37 \u00b0C and 39.5 \u00b0C. This difference was due to the degree of phosphorylation of the polypeptide which was most efficient at higher temperatures. There was no amplification of any single polypeptide induced by the ts mutants and this is similar to the results obtained for the other MHVs [2, 9, 201. These studies provide the groundwork for further investigation into the pathogenic properties of MHV-3. It is not yet clear, however, as to whether the ts-lesions and the altered pathogenic effects of some of the mutants are due to the same mutations.",
