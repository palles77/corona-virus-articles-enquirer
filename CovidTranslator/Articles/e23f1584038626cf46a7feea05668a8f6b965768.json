Fifteen air samples were collected with All Glass Impinger-30 (AGI-30) air samplers in each house. Airborne ND viruses were also isolated and virulence identified by in vivo tests. Avirulent viruses were detected both in air samples and swab samples in four houses by degenerate primers based RT-PCR. Virulent viruses were detected only in the air samples by degenerate primers based RT-PCR in two houses. Seven strains viruses were isolated from the RT-PCR positive air samples. Of the seven strains, three strains were virulent viruses and four strains were avirulent viruses identified by in vivo tests. The results showed that it was feasible to detect and differentiate NDV in the air samples using degenerate primers based RT-PCR. This technique could decrease the time it required identify NDV infected flocks while distinguishing between virulent and avirulent viruses. It will help effectively to control Newcastle disease.",

            "text": "Airborne and droplet transmission are the major routes for transmission of animal viral diseases, such as Newcastle disease (ND), Avian Influenza, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) and Foot-and-Mouth disease. Newcastle disease (ND) is included in the World Organization (OIE) for Animal Health list of notifiable diseases (former list A). Historically, ND has been a devastating disease of poultry, and the disease remains one of the major problems affecting existing or developing poultry industries in many countries (Alexander, 1995 (Alexander, , 2003 . Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the causative agent of ND, is a non-segmented, single-stranded, negative sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Avulavirus within the Paramyxovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae family (Mayo, 2002) . Its genome is approximately 15 kb in length and encodes six proteins, namely, nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), Hemagglutinin-Neuraminidase (HN) and large protein (L) or polymerase in the order 3 -leader-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-trailer-5 (de Leeuw and Peeters, 1999; Pedersen et al., 2004) . 'Traditional' routes of NDV transmission like direct animal contact, contaminated feed, water, implements, transport contact or transmission by people were identified (Alexander, 1988 (Alexander, , 2003 . Airborne transmission was also one important route for transmission of Newcastle disease. Alexander (1988 Alexander ( , 1995 Alexander ( , 2003 recognized that the majority of ND infections were attributable to the inhalation of small viral aerosols or viral droplets by susceptible chickens. Airborne transmission was considered a significant factor in the 1970 -1971 ND outbreaks in England (Hugh-Jones et al., 1973 ) and the 1973 ND epidemic in Northern Ireland (McFerran, 1989 . Airborne NDV can also infect humans and cause clinical symptoms such as mild conjunctivitis (Chang, 1981) . Therefore, airborne NDV continues to be a major threat to chickens and people.",

These tests are cumbersome, labor intensive, inhumane and some times inconclusive (Tiwari et al., 2004) . In order to meet the need of production and eradication of Newcastle disease as soon as possible, more rapid methods that enable detection and differentiation of pathotypes of the airborne virus are required. RT-PCR alone using degenerate primers designed from the 'F' gene for detection and differentiation of airborne NDV avirulent strains from virulent strains is described in the present report. This technique could decrease the time required to identify NDV infected flocks while distinguishing between virulent and avirulent viruses. It will help to control effectively Newcastle disease in future.",

A total of 75 air samples and 60 swab samples were collected from the five chicken houses. Both virulent and avirulent viruses were detected by RT-PCR and were also isolated from air samples in the vaccinated chicken flocks (Tables 1 and 2) . However, only avirulent viruses were detected by RT-PCR in the swab samples (Table 2 ). It indicated that only a small proportion of bird samples could not represent all the chickens and bird samples were collected from all the chickens was impractical at the same time. Environmental sampling has several advantages for flock surveillance, including minimizing direct human contact with flocks, eliminating individual bird handling, and providing a time-and cost-efficient sampling technique (Hietala et al., 2005) . Air sampling of poultry environments to detect NDV, is not a new concept. Delay et al. (1948) documented originally the recovery of Newcastle disease virus from poultry environment air samples in 1948, and Hietala et al. (2005) collected successfully air of poultry environments to detect airborne NDV by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR.

The prevalence of ND has been both mild and sporadic. However, NDV still induces a high mortality rate in some regions in the world, which is caused mainly by virulent NDV. In the current study, virulent NDV were detected in seven air samples of two chicken houses, though there was no prevailing of ND. Virulent NDV may have been present in the chicken house and the surrounding environment constantly. Airborne NDV was a major threat to chickens. Once some of the failed immunized chickens were challenged by virulent NDV, the spread of ND will probably occur (Toyoda et al., 1989; Seal et al., 1995) . It is important to develop rapid and accurate methods to monitor and differentiate NDV aerosols in chicken houses. The specificity, sensitivity, and reduced processing time of PCR are suit-able for applications for aerobiological monitoring for the detection of small numbers of targeted microorganisms (Saiki et al., 1988; Alvarez et al., 1995) . Agranovski et al. (2004) had proven that the PCR method could be utilized in detection the Vaccinia virus and considered that even in case of some decay, collected fluid could be tested by RT-PCR to detect qualitatively the existence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus in the ambient air.",

Therefore, differentiation of virulent and avirulent strains in the air is an important aspect of diagnosis of virus aerosol. Kant et al.

(2004) also demonstrated that degenerate primers based RT-PCR was a simple and rapid for the detection and differentiation of virulent and avirulent NDV, which is important for the control of the disease in the event of the outbreaks.",

As demonstrated in the present study, the use of an available air sampler, paired with virus detection using degenerate primers RT-PCR, allows environmental air sampling to be a more accessible, time-efficient, and a practical surveillance tool than described previously, which was also demonstrated by Hietala et al. (2005) . The current study opens new possibilities of moving to a next development stage related to the replacement of the standard RT-PCR with the available multichannel real time RT-PCR capable of providing quantitative results within even shorter time periods for a number of microorganisms simultaneously.",
