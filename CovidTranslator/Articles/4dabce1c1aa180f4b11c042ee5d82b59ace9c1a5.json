In the present study, the 3 0 terminal 7.2 kb of the genome of a recently isolated variant of IBV (N1/03) was sequenced and compared with the sequences of classical and novel strains of IBV, the two main groups of these viruses in Australia. The comparison revealed that recombination between classical and novel IBVs was responsible for the emergence of the new variant. It was concluded that novel IBVs, which have not been detected since 1993, and which are phylogenically more distant from classical IBVs than turkey coronaviruses, might still be circulating and contributing to the evolution of IBV in Australia.",

A number of factors, including mutation and recombination, and the widespread use of live attenuated vaccines, play an important role in increasing the number of new genetic variants [3, 8, 15, 16, 28] . Recombination and mutation are two major forces in coronavirus evolution, and polymerase jumping during coinfection may promote recombination events between coronaviruses [22] . Molecular characterization using sequencing and phylogenetic analysis are effective methods for detection and characterization of recombination events among RNA viruses [29] . N1/62, a nephropathogenic strain of IBV, was the first isolate of IBV obtained in Australia, in 1962 [7] . Since 1962, a number of distinct strains of IBV have been isolated, including a group of strains that were found to have no epitopes in common with other IBV strains on either their N or M proteins [12] . In a study on the pathogenicity of Australian strains of IBV, a change was detected in the prevalence of IBV strains, from highly nephropathogenic strains in the 1960s and 1970s to strains predominantly pathogenic for the respiratory tract in the 1980s and early 1990s, indicating that IBV strains in Australia have undergone a significant change since 1962 [13] .",

The novel IBVs are phylogenetically distant from the classical IBVs, and in fact, classical IBVs and turkey coronaviruses are more similar to each other than they are to the novel IBVs. Recently, the isolation of a new variant of IBV in Australia, from broiler farms located in New South Wales, that had low S1 gene identity to those of classical and novel IBVs but N gene and 3 0 untranslated region sequences similar to those of classical IBVs, suggested the emergence of a new subgroup of IBVs in Australia [14] .

Using Simplot, 456 informative sites were found that could support one of three possible trees. For almost 90% of the S gene (3 kb), 365 informative sites were found, and 84% of these informative sites supported a tree clustering N1/03 with the novel IBV strain N1/88. In contrast, only 8% of the informative sites supported each of the other two possible trees in this region (P \\ 0.0005). For the rest of sequences (3,000-7,200 bp), 95 informative sites were found, with 60% supporting the tree clustering N1/03 with VicS and only 14% supporting the tree clustering N1/03 with N1/88 (P \\ 0.05). This indicated that N1/03 clustered with the classical IBV strain VicS throughout the 3 0 -terminal 4.2 kb of its genome and confirmed that a recombination event had occurred at the end of the S gene region (at around position 3000) and that N1/03 is a recombinant virus that emerged from recombination between these two groups of IBVs in Australia.",

The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are given in the number of base substitutions per site N1/03 was equally different from both the classical and novel IBVs, while the rest of the 3 0 -terminal 7.2-kb region of the genome clustered closely with those of the classical IBVs and was very different from those of the novel IBVs. The similarity of the N1/03 E, M and N genes to those of classical IBVs suggested that this isolate was closely related to the most commonly used Australian IBV vaccine strains. As these strains have been used for a long time in Australia, it is possible that they have contributed to the emergence of variant IBVs in the field. The S gene of N1/03 clustered more closely with the novel IBVs, and similarity plotting and bootscan analysis confirmed the close relationship between the S genes of N1/03 and the novel IBVs and suggested that the crossover event occurred near the 3 0 end of this gene.",

However, it is particularly notable here because of the very significant phylogenic distance between the novel and classical Australian strains of IBV. Indeed, the novel strains of IBV are more distinct from the classical strains than is turkey coronavirus, and they lack several of the smaller nonstructural genes found in classical strains. In conclusion, this study showed that the recombination was involved in the emergence of the new variant of IBV in Australia and that a rapid and reliable technique is needed to determine whether the novel IBVs are still circulating in poultry farms. It would be appropriate to sequence and analyse the polymerase genes of classical, novel and new variant strains of IBV to obtain further information about the relationships between the different Australian IBVs.",
