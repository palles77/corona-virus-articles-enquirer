            "text": "A cDNA library was constructed from the liver of Lampetra japonica. 10077 ESTs were obtained by random selecting clones for sequencing. The results demonstrated that 8515 ESTs were assembled into 648 consensus sequences, represented 2210 unique transcripts, 47.06% of which were predicted as full length cDNAs. In addition, 1562 ESTs were singlets. Using the BLAST to align the assembled ESTs, we found that 93.9% (2053) transcripts shared similarity to sequences published in GenBank databases. The functional annotations to assembled ESTs showed that the genes, involved in immunology, blood coagulation and metabolism of jawed vertebrates, were highly expressed in the liver of L. japonica. Furthermore, 8 potential novel genes were identified. Further comparing liver transcriptome of L. japonica with Fundulus heteroclitus, Mus musculus, Bos Taurus, and Homo sapiens revealed that the genes of Chitinase and Polysaccharides metabolism were more highly expressed in L. japonica than the others, which implied that they may play an important role in immunity of L. japonica. In addition, using the TargetScan, we marked microRNA target within 3\u2032 UTR of L. japonica liver transcriptome. The data indicated that some microRNA targets were homology with the targets embeded in human cancer genes. The result seems to provide a useful clue to the treatment of human cancer. Therefore, the present work will be an important resource for investigating the functional genomics and proteomics of L. japonica as well as evolution of vertebrates.",

Recent archaeological finds indicate that modern lampreyes, compared with the ancestors of 3.6 billion years ago, have little change in morphology structure. Indeed, the lamprey is living fossil [1] . Thus lamprey is the preferred material for revealing the origin and evolution of vertebrates. At present, most studies have been confined to the morphology structure and ecological distribution of the lamprey [2] , whilst other aspects of genomics and proteomics are less known. The transcriptome analysis of sea lamprey intestine [3] and Lampetra japonica oral gland [4] have been published, but the biggest digestive gland-related genes in the liver have yet not been reported. Therefore, the analysis of L. ja-ponica liver transcriptome will provide a theoretical foundation for origin and evolution of vertebrate liver.",

Many of such studies have been focused on the comparative morphology, especially emphasizing the early evolution of vertebrates. For example, some experiments demonstrated the homology of brain genes and pharyngeal structure related genes in the lamprey and jaw vertebrates [6] [7] , and discussed Hox gene duplication mechanism [8] . As an important metabolism organ, liver has increasingly attracted much attention. Savina [9] compared the bioenergetic parameters of liver mitochondria in lamprey and frog during metabolic depression and activity. Rotchell [10] analyzed the catalytic properties of CYP1A enzyme in lamprey liver. Gamper [11] studied the reversible metabolic depression of lamprey liver during pre-spawning. In addition, liver also takes charge the front-line immune defense in the body. Recently, scientists identified a new type of variable lymphocyte receptors from sea lamprey lymphocyte-like cells, which use an unusual gene rearrangements process to produce receptor diversity. This research revealed lamprey has a unique adaptive immune responses [12] . To be brief, Lamprey imprint the evolutionary history from invertebrates to vertebrates, including the evolution information of the various functional genomes. Therefore, further studying on the lamprey liver genome and transcriptome has a very great theoretical and practical significance.",

L. japonica, mainly depending on other fish flesh for food, is semi-parasitic animals, and its potential nonspecific immunity mechanism plays an important role in preventing infection which is the more effective way to remove and degrade pathogenic microorganisms and other harmful substances.

They have an adaptive immune response, in which the receptor is divergent to the jaw vertebrate recombinant antigen receptor. Interestingly, they use an unusual gene rearrangement process to produce receptor diversity [12] . Lymphocyte-like cells in the intestine of the sea lamprey were isolated, but no sequences with significant similarity to MHC and T cell receptor were found. The lamprey was considered to reach a stage for the emergence of adaptive immunity [3] . Although the above various factors were found in our EST sets, the similarity was still very low. Significantly, the heat shock protein was relatively abundant. More and more evidence showed that heat shock proteins participated in specific and non-specific immune response. Besides, the heat shock protein, as a molecular chaperone with antigen information, can promote spe- cific immune response and stimulate the body's immune response, but sometimes heat shock proteins can also activate immune reaction [26] [27] . Due to the lack of B cell, T cell receptor and MHC antigen in L. japonica, it was reasonable to estimate that L. japonica tried to make use of heat shock protein to carry out antigen targeting or activating immune reaction in the early adaptive immunity stages. The other representatives which expressed abundantly were involved in protein synthesis and energy metabolism, such as Blood plasma apolipoprotein LAL2, Ribosomal protein, NADH dehydrogenation oxidase, Cytochrome oxidase and ATP synthase. Previous studies had identified that Blood plasma apolipoprotein LAL1 and LAL2 were abundant in lamprey blood [28] . Here, our results demonstated that they were highly expressed in the liver. Apolipoprotein, playing the major role in transportting, dissolving cholesterol and phospholipids, was controlled by the apolipoprotein E gene which was secreted in the liver. Moreover, it also was responsible for inducing macrophage and cholesterolste accumulation, and significantly promoting macrophage proliferation. Mouse liver SAGE data analysis showed that apolipoprotein mRNA expression was higher than 3.8%. Furthermore, the genes which encoded plasma proteins expressed highly in L. japonica liver. In addition, our results also indicated that 123 transcripts corresponded to the Ribosomal protein.",

Firstly, the chitinase perfects the \"disrupting task\" to the cell wall of pathogenic microorganisms. Next, chitosan stimulates the macrophage proliferation in livers, which can be used to remove or swallow harmful substances via nonspecific immunity. Abundant expression of chitinase in L. japonica liver may be correlated with its specific lifestyle. Chitin exists widespreadly in cell wall of low plant and the shell of fungus, shrimp, crab, insects and crustaceans. As known, lamprey larvae mainly feed on planktonic, lives in freshwater streams, while the majority of adult lamprey are the semi-parasitic animals. They attach to other fish and feed on their blood. In dependent life, they eat plankton. Thus the pathogens from blood and plankton may be the sources of chitin.",

Immunity should be related with chitin metabolism. In addition, with certain factors of the adaptive immune being found in this article, L. japonica could have the ability of adaptive immune. Therefore, we speculated that adaptive immune of L. japonica might be close but different from the jaw vertebrate.",

In the present work, the cDNA library of L. japonica liver was constructed. 10077 ESTs were obtained by random selecting clones for sequencing. Bioinformatics analyses of the EST sequences revealed the pro-tein expression characteristics and the potential mechanisms of higher expressed protein in L. japonica liver. Further analysises of microRNA target within 3\u2032 UTR of L. japonica liver transcriptome demonstrated that some microRNA targets were homologous with the counterparts in human cancer gene regulation, which may provide some useful clews for the treatment of human cancer. Moreover, by comparing liver transcriptome of L. japonica with the other four species, it could be found that the genes of chitinase and polysaccharides metabolism were more highly expressed in L. japonica than in the others, which implied that they may play an important role in immunity of L. japonica. According to the present results, we further speculated the unique immune response model and evolution stage of L. japonica. We have systematically studied the two transcriptomes of oral glands and liver in L. japonica. In conclusion, our work will have very important academic significance and application foreground, as well as provide the foundation for further functional gene cloning and proteintomics study.",

The further analyses indicated that 23107, 1895, 498 of 25500 microRNA target sites were respectively matched to the animal, C. elegans and virus. In addition, our findings also demon-strated that microRNA target sites of different species were highly conserved. For example, the miR-7, miR-92, miR-18 family of 17 species, miR-19a family of 16 species, miR-16, miR-17 family of 15 species, and miR-15a, miR-20, miR-29, miR-100, miR-103, miR-135, miR-181, miR-106 family of 14 species were respectively matched to the same target site in 3\u2032 UTR of lamprey.",
