Regional economic integration not only stimulates labour mobility, but also achieve scale economy, both of which may also influence carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) marginal abatement costs through affecting energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, productivity growth, and technical progress. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies has currently concerned the influence of regional economic integration on CO 2 marginal abatement costs. To fill this research gap, this study first theoretically clarifies the influence mechanism of regional economic integration on CO 2 marginal abatement cost, and then empirically attempts to investigate their relationship in the context of China, with panel data models. To serve this purpose, the provincial CO 2 marginal abatement cost and regional economic integration are estimated by parametric directional distance function and price-based approach, respectively. The results show that China's regional economic integration level indeed gradually improved over 2002-2011 except in 2003-04 and 2006-09 due to the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the sub-prime loan crisis. Moreover, evolution of regional economic integration indeed contributes to the increase of CO 2 marginal abatement cost at 5% significance level. Using robust tests, it can be found that the results are also reliable and robust to sub-samples.",

Nevertheless, there is no unified definition of REI in academe thus far, even though some studies have attempted to investigate this issue (Auer, 2005; Hans et al., 2003) . For instance, Hans et al. (2003) defines REI as a procedure by which states within a given region increase their level of collaboration with respect to political, economic, security, and socio-cultural issues. Auer (2005) notes that REI implies a removal of barriers to free trade in the region, growing the free movement of people, labour, goods, and capital across states. In general, there are five levels, beginning from a free trade area, to customs union, common market, economic union, and finally political union in the evolution of REI (Ester, 2013) .",

            "text": "The evolution of REI in 31 provinces in Mainland China also experiences a similar process from relatively low to high similar to other countries in recent years. Being an agricultural country, given China's economic reform before 1978, provinces could always be selfsufficient, i.e., a province always supports itself with its own resource and products (Li and Lin, 2017) . The level of REI was relatively low as each province is a relatively complete industrial system (Ke, 2015) . After 1978, the new market economy encouraged economic cooperation among provinces and flow of goods, and therefore regional barriers were gradually weakening, which led to an increase of regional economic integration levels, such as that seen in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area, and Yangtze River Delta. The integration of regions not only accelerates the flow of production factors, management, and technology but also stimulates the mobility of labour and capital, according to the Energy Economics 74 (2018) [263] [264] [265] [266] [267] [268] [269] [270] [271] [272] [273] [274] career construction theory (Corse and Rehfuss, 2011) . For example, 8.2 million people flow into Beijing in 2015, accounting for about 37.9% of her permanent population (BSY, 2016) , and 9.8 million did likewise, a share of 40.6% in Shanghai (SSY, 2016) .",

            "text": "Currently, several studies have attempted to investigate REI and its corresponding influences on labour and capital mobility (Berkowitz and DeJong, 2003; Xu and Voon, 2003) . Berkowitz and DeJong (2003) assess the evolution of REI within Russia during 1995-1999 and explore potential determinants of this evolution. The study finds a strong negative correspondence between openness to international trade and internal economic integration. Similarly, Xu and Voon (2003) gauge the degree of China's regional integration using a statistical model, and the results show that China is relatively integrated across provinces and the level of integration has increased over time. Meanwhile, several studies explore the impact of REI on the mobility of labour and capital, investment, and trade (Behrens et al., 2007; Ester, 2013; Kumar et al., 2014; Sch\u00f6b and Wildasin, 2007) . Ester (2013) investigates the relationship between REI and professional labour mobility within the context of the African community. Kumar et al. (2014) analyses the capital mobility caused by regional economic integration within four regional economic communities in Africa. Behrens et al. (2007) investigates the impact of regional economic integration on trade and finds that the benefits of integration come as trade barriers fall; however, to the best of current knowledge, no study has investigated the influence of REI on CO 2 marginal abatement cost (MAC). With increasingly serious climate change, MAC of CO 2 emissions, measuring the economic loss of reducing an additional unit of CO 2 emissions, are intensively discussed over the past decades with a bottom-up approach (Vaillancourt et al., 2008) , macroeconomic approach (Minihan and Wu, 2012; Zhang and Folmer, 1998) , and an efficiency analysis approach (Choi et al., 2012; Du and Mao, 2015; F\u00e4re et al., 2006; Lee and Zhang, 2012; Lee and Zhou, 2015; Leleu, 2012; Tang et al., 2016; He, 2017a, 2017b) . Among these studies, some prefer to evaluate the value of MAC of CO 2 emissions at national, regional, and industrial levels (Lee and Zhou, 2015; Wei et al., 2013) , while some focus on the dynamic relationship between MAC and CO 2 abatement to provide wider application to energy and environmental policymaking (M\u00fcller and Tol, 2013; Guo et al., 2016; Du et al., 2015b) . Meanwhile, some are interested in investigating the determinants of MAC, which includes industrial structure, energy consumption structure, and urbanisation level (Du et al., 2015b) . For a firm, the age, scale, and location are the determinants of MAC (Wei et al., 2013) however, the influence of REI on MAC has been ignored to investigate. In fact, REI has a significant effect on the key parameters used in MAC estimation. On the one hand, the mobility of labour and capital caused by REI will not only contribute to gross domestic product (GDP) growth from the perspective of the production side, according to the Cobb-Douglas production function, but also increase the local energy consumption, and therefore CO 2 emissions and environmental pressure, which may influence the MAC of CO 2 emissions. On the other hand, technological progress benefitting from REI will also have an impact on local production and carbon emissions technology, which is conducive to the improvement of productivity and carbon emissions efficiency, both of which will affect CO 2 marginal abatement costs (Wang and He, 2017b) .",

To serve this purpose, the provincial CO 2 marginal abatement costs incurred during 2002-2011 are firstly evaluated with a parametric directional distance function (PDDF) model. Secondly, following the approach of Parsley and Wei (2001) , a regional economic integration index is constructed using a price-based approach considering the stylised fact that the dispersion of price differentials will be gradually weakening by the evolution of regional economic integration (Li and Lin, 2017; Parsley and Wei, 2001; Xu, 2002) . Finally, a panel data model with 30 cross-sections and 10 periods is established. In addition to empirical results, robustness tests are conducted through the use of a resampling, and different regional economic integration indexes. The study could provide important insights about the determinants of CO 2 marginal abatement cost change.",

            "text": "There is no doubt that the evolution of REI has considerable effects on labour and capital mobility, investment, as well as the CO 2 marginal abatement cost. Based on previous studies, REI could influence the MAC of CO 2 emissions via the following mechanisms (see Fig. 1 ). Firstly, the evolution of REI stimulates the mobility of labour and capital across different regions (Ester, 2013; Kumar et al., 2014) , which may influence the MAC of CO 2 emissions from both production, and consumption sides. On the one hand, the mobility of labour will influence the amount of energy consumption, and therefore CO 2 emissions. On the other hand, labour mobility will also influence local labour input. Proper labour input increases are conducive to regional GDP growth: however, labour mobility may also result in congestion of labour input considering the unbalanced level of economic development, which may worsen productivity and GDP growth (Sueyoshi and Goto, 2016) . Therefore, labour mobility may lead to both positive and negative influences on input-output indicators. If the positive influence is greater than the negative influence, then labour mobility may lead to an increase of MAC and vice versa. Secondly, the evolution of REI is conducive to achieving a certain scale economy, which is regarded as an important source of productivity growth in many studies (Wang and Feng, 2015; Li and Lin, 2017) . The achievement of scale in an economy contributes to productivity growth, which would influence the MAC of CO 2 emissions. Thirdly, the evolution of REI encourages competition among regions, which accelerates technological progress and the improvement of management as enterprises have more incentive to invest in R&D aimed at improving technology and management (Ke, 2015; Li and Lin, 2017) . Finally, regional economic integration encourages specialisation according to comparative advantage theory (Grossman and Helpman, 2015; Li and Lin, 2017) . In the process of REI, the firms tend to have more opportunities to choose collaborative partners with relatively low opportunity cost, which urges firms to promote their technology and management to achieve specialisation to decease their opportunity cost. Specialisation, a source of productivity growth, could also influence the MAC of CO 2 emissions. Nevertheless, regional economic integration is just a small part of the sources of CO 2 marginal abatement cost change, and the main components are technological progress and adjustment of economic structure. With the progress of production and CO 2 technology, the potential of CO 2 emissions reduction would gradually decrease, directly resulting in higher marginal abatement cost, vice versa and regional economic integration merely accelerates this process. Another main component is the adjustment of economic structure. In general, heavy industries are always typified as high energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, low efficiency (Wang and Feng, 2015; Wang et al., 2017) . High emission with low efficiency always results in great potential of CO 2 abatement, and therefore the marginal abatement cost is relatively low. With the adjustment of economic structure, the share of heavy industries is falling, and that of the tertiary industry is increasing. As a consequence, the marginal abatement cost of CO 2 emissions also changes accordingly. In empirical study, we also take technology progress and adjustment of economic structure into consideration.",

Considering data availability, this study chose a price-based approach to construct REI index. In general, as suggested by the law of one price (PPP), the dispersion of the price differentials of the goods across the regions will tend to be stable with the evolution of regional economic integration. In other words, the prices of goods in different regions will converge with the evolution of regional economic integration level as the production factors, goods, technology, and management flow across the regions. Based on this important fact, Ke (2015) and Parsley and Wei (2001) constructed a comprehensive index incorporating price information about various goods, to measure the level of REI with a price approach. Similarly, this study will also construct a regional economic integration index by incorporating price information about eight diversified goods items, covering several categories to reduce the error of estimation.",

(6), we estimate the provincial CO 2 marginal abatement costs during 2002-2011, where the actual price of GDP is assumed to be 1 (p i = 1) following the approach of Du et al. (2015a) . Fig. 1 shows the average CO 2 marginal abatement cost of each province during 2002-2011 with the colour of each province on a map of China. A deeper colour represents a higher marginal abatement cost, while a lighter colour implies a lower cost. As shown in Fig. 2 , Beijing, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Shanghai, with relatively high economic levels of development, have higher marginal abatement cost, and specifically, a cost of more than RMB 300 will be incurred per additional unit of CO 2 emissions abatement. Similarly, other eastern provinces, for instance, Tianjin, Jilin, Fujian, and Shandong, have a relatively high marginal abatement cost. While turning attention to the Central and Western provinces with relatively less developed economies, it could be found that their marginal abatement costs are significantly lower than those of the eastern provinces, especially for some western provinces, such as Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, etc., with less than RMB 100 marginal abatement cost. With higher production technology and more developed economies, scholars agree that China's eastern provinces would suffer more cost per additional unit of CO 2 emissions reduction relative to less developed provinces in the west and in central China (Choi et al., 2012; Du et al., 2015b) .",

Firstly, with the passage of time, the average marginal abatement cost of three areas all consecutively rises from 2002 to 2011. In accordance with macroeconomic theory, technological progress inevitably occurs over time, which certainly leads to higher CO 2 marginal abatement costs. Secondly, CO 2 marginal abatement costs in eastern areas are higher than those in central and western areas: differing from many previous studies which conclude that western provinces had the lowest marginal abatement costs, this study finds that the average abatement cost of central provinces is first slightly lower than that of western provinces before 2009, and then higher thereafter. Although this finding was unexpected, it is, nonetheless, explicable. Du et al. (2015a) found that a significant U-shaped relationship exists between carbon intensity and CO 2 marginal abatement cost. It specifically concluded that when the carbon intensity is relatively low (less than 6 ton/RMB 10,000), the marginal abatement cost will decrease with increasing carbon intensity: however, after exceeding 6 ton/RMB 10,000, the marginal abatement cost will also increase with increasing carbon intensity. Here, it is well known that western provinces have the largest carbon intensity among all provinces, followed by central provinces, and eastern provinces, resulting in the highest CO 2 marginal abatement cost falling of the eastern provinces, followed by that on the central provinces. If the carbon intensity of western provinces was too high, its marginal abatement cost may also be higher than that of central provinces according to their U-shaped relationship.",

(8), P(i, t, k)/P(i, t \u2212 1, k) actually represents the price index of goods k in province i between period t and t -1, therefore, 2400 original data points were collected from consideration of eight types of goods in 30 provinces from 2002 to 2011. With frequent trade, the flow of goods actually happens between any two provinces today. Therefore, 423 (30 \u00d7 29/2) province-pairs with eight types of goods over 10 years generate 33,840 observations. By means of Eqs. (9) and (10), the panel data of regional economic integration with 30 provinces and 10 periods are generated. It should be noted that, while constructing this REI index, the other factors influencing the dispersion of price differentials, such as good-specific heterogeneity, have been filtered out. Fig. 5 shows the average regional integration of eastern, central, western areas, and the whole country during 2002-2011. Generally, regardless of sub-area, or the whole country, their level of REI has gradually improved with the passage of time. This phenomenon is explained as follows: with the development of China's economy and transportation systems, trade activities have become more frequent. For instance, people in Beijing could buy bananas produced in Hainan, and raisins produced in Xinjiang could be traded to Shanghai, Guangdong, etc. The frequent flow of various goods among different provinces prevents the dispersion of price differentials, resulting in the evolution of regional economic integration.",

In these two periods, many relevant trading activities had to be canceled, and the flow of goods was not as frequent as before, resulting in a decline in REI.

Furthermore, the relevant study showed that the marginal abatement cost of CO 2 from coal burning also differ from that of CO 2 emissions from the burning of oil and gas. Consequently, the energy mix may be another factor influencing marginal abatement costs. In accordance with Du et al. (2015a) , the share of coal consumption to total energy consumption is used to proxy for the energy mix. Relevant data are extracted from the China Energy Statistical Yearbook. Fig. 6 depicts the scatter diagram between regional economic integration and CO 2 marginal abatements costs across provinces. The left one presents the original relationship between regional economic integration and MAC of CO 2 emissions, in which it can be easily found the existence of heteroscedasticity. In the theory of econometrics, the logarithmic form of variables could effectively overcome the defect of heteroscedasticity, and therefore the relationship between the logarithmic REI and MAC is shown in the right diagram in Fig. 6 . As shown in the two scatter diagrams, a province with a higher regional integration level always tends to have a higher CO 2 marginal abatement cost. Furthermore, the relationships tend to be different in different provinces, i.e., individual heterogeneity prevails.",

By controlling variables CO 2 emissions intensity, urban level, composition of industry, environmental regulation and energy consumption structure in Models 2 to 6, the regression coefficients of ln(ln(REI)) is significantly positive at 5% significance level, which imply that the evolution of regional economic integration partially contributes to the increase of MAC of CO 2 emissions. In addition, these models also show a relatively stable relationship between regional economic integration and marginal abatement cost as the coefficients of ln(ln(REI)) in Models 2 to 6 ranged from 0.203 to 0.224. Therefore, we can conclude that the evolution of REI indeed contributes the increase of CO 2 marginal abatement cost. In the process of regional economic integration, goods, labour, capital, advanced technology, and management philosophy flow among provinces. Meanwhile, the evolution of REI stimulates the reallocation of resource and energy, which is conducive to the improvement of carbon emissions efficiency. Consequently, the evolution of REI contributes to the improvement of carbon emissions efficiency and technological progress, resulting in the increase of MAC of CO 2 emissions. Earlier studies have shown a positive relationship exists between CO 2 emissions performance and marginal abatement cost, while Li and Lin (2017) also conclude that CO 2 emissions performance benefits from the evolution of regional economic integration. These two important conclusions could also provide indirect evidence for the results of this study.",

Their effect on the MAC of CO 2 emissions could be interpreted as follows: the increase in level of urbanisation implies social progress, thereafter, rural labours flow into cities, which could generate more jobs, contributing to the improvement of labour productivity and GDP growth. Both of these will induce an increase in the MAC of CO 2 emissions. As discussed in Section 4.3.1, environmental regulation may affects MAC positively or nagatively. The significantly positive coefficient indicates that the positive influence is greater than the negative influence. Therefore, the increase in environmental regulation will induce an increase in MAC. It is worth mentioning that the square of environmental regulation significantly contributes to MAC of CO 2 emissions, which indicates that the influence of environmental regulation on MAC will be larger and larger with the increase of share of environment control investment.",

Negative coefficient of CO 2 emissions intensity at 1% significant level provides the strong evidence that technological progress is one of the main sources of MAC increase. As another main source of marginal abatement cost change, economic structure also negatively influences the marginal abatement cost of CO 2 emissions according to the regression results. With the increase of share of heavy industry, typified as high emissions and low efficiency, CO 2 abatement potential increases and therefore the marginal abatement cost of CO 2 emissions falls. Note that in our results, energy consumption structure doesn't significantly influence the MAC of CO 2 emissions. The main reason is that the dependent variable is the logarithm of MAC to overcome the heteroscedasticity.

The phenomenon is easy to understand: in our opinion, regional economic integration is not the only reason for the increasing MAC. The main reason for the increased MAC is technical progress, including the application of energy conservation and carbon abatement technology, which improve the carbon emissions efficiency and reduce the potential for carbon abatement. Regional economic integration just accelerates technical progress. Overall, these key findings suggest that regional economic integration should be further encouraged, as it actually stimulates the decrease of potential for CO 2 abatement, and technological progress.",

The robustness of REI measure. In Section 4.2, we have employed the price index of eight goods to measure the regional economic integration level. Considering the fact that different choices of the goods may potentially influence the regional economic level, in this Section, we construct another eight kinds of regional economic integration indexes (REI1, REI2, \u2026, REI8) by employing the price information of different goods combinations to confirm the robustness of the measure. 1 Note: The definition of variables and significance level are same as Table 4 . Note: The definition of variables and significance level are same as Table 4 . 1 REI1 is measured by the price index of grains, cigarettes and wine, medicines, domestic appliances, fuels, newspapers and magazines, and office supplies; REI2 includes grains, cigarettes and wine, cosmetics, medicine, clothing and shoes, domestic appliances, fuels, newspapers and magazines, and office supplies; REI3 includes grains, cigarettes and wine, cosmetics, medicines, commodities, domestic appliances, fuels, and office supplies REI 4 includes grains, cigarettes and wine, cosmetics, medicines, clothing and shoes, domestic appliances, fuels, and office supplies; REI5 includes grains, cigarettes and wine, cosmetics, medicines, clothing and shoes, commodities, domestic appliances, fuels, and newspapers and magazines; REI6 grains, cigarettes and wine, cosmetics, clothing and shoes, commodities, domestic appliances, fuels, and newspapers and magazines office supplies; REI 7 includes grains, cigarettes and wine, medicines, clothing and shoes, commodities, domestic appliances, fuels, and newspapers and magazines, office supplies; REI 8 includes grains, cigarettes and wine, cosmetics, medicines, clothing and shoes, commodities, domestic appliances, fuels, and office supplies. Fig. 7 depicts the kernel density curves of eight new regional economic integration indexes and original one in Section 4.2. According to Fig. 7 , it can be easily found that nine kinds of regional economic integration indexes almost follow the same kernel density distribution, from which we could conclude that the measure of regional economic integration is robust. Furthermore, to more specifically capture the differences of eight kinds of regional economic integration, Fig. 8 also shows the boxplots of these indicators in 2002 , 2005 , 2008 , 2011 , respectively. Taking 2002 as an example, even though their maximum, minimum, 25 percentage quantiles and 75 percentage quantiles are not totally same, but their differences are slight. For instance, the maximum of REI8, the largest one among these indicators, is just 0.2 greater than that of REI 2, the smallest maximum of these indicators. Moreover, these indexes in other years also follow this phenomenon. Therefore, we could conclude that the measure of regional economic integration is robust to the choice of goods, even though slight differences exist among them. 4.3.3.2. The robustness of regression results. Currently, many approaches are used to test the robustness of such results including using an alternative approach to estimate the results, resampling and so on (Lin and Du, 2015) . In this Section, we firstly would like to employ the eight new regional integration indexes replace the original index in Section 4.3 to check whether the new indexes would also influence marginal abatement cost of CO 2 emissions. And then we will check whether the results are also robust to the subsamples.",

Model 6.1-6.8 use eight new regional economic integration indexes (REI1, REI2, \u2026, REI8) to replace REI index in model 6, respectively. As shown in Table 5 , it can be easily found that all of the regional economic integrations in model 6.1-6.8 positively influence the marginal abatement cost of CO 2 emissions at 5% or 10% significance level, even though the price index of several different goods are used to construct the regional economic integration index. Consequently, these results reveal that the influence of regional economic integration on marginal abatement cost is robust to the choice of goods. Next, we will also check whether the results are robust to the subsamples. Here, we construct four subsamples by excluding some years and some outliers. Specifically, subsample 1 and 2 excludes year 2011 and 2010, while subsample 3 and subsample 4 exclude the outliers above 95th percentile and below the 5th percentile in terms of average regional economic integration across provinces. The regression results are presented in Table 6 . It can be easily found that the coefficients of regional integration are positive at the 5% significance level, and they are also close to those of the full sample. There is no doubt that these results reveal the robust positive influence of regional economic integration on marginal abatement cost of CO 2 .",

To serve this purpose, a parametric distance function model was used to estimate the CO 2 marginal abatement costs in 30 provinces between 2002 and 2011. Then the level of regional integration was estimated by a price-based approach. Finally, a series of panel data models were constructed to investigate the impact of regional integration on marginal abatement cost. The main results may be summarised as follows: i) CO 2 marginal abatement costs vary by region. On average, these of eastern areas with higher level-economies, are the highest, at approximately RMB 300-400/ton, followed by those in central areas. Some western areas have the lowest CO 2 marginal abatement cost at less than RMB 100/ton. Although varying greatly, the CO 2 marginal abatement costs of most provinces present an upward trend from 2002 to 2011, which implied a certain technical progress in these provinces in the sample periods. ii) As expected, the regional integration of China shows an upward trend in 2002-2011 with the exception of 2003-2004 and 2006-2009 due to the spread of the SARS virus in 2003 and the effects of the American sub-prime loan crisis in 2008.Moreover, regional integration also exhibits regional differences. iii) The evolution of regional economic integration indeed contributes to the increase of CO 2 marginal abatement cost at the 5% significance level, as regional economic integration accelerates the labour mitigation, technological progress Furthermore, the results are robust to the choice of sub-sample and several new regional economic integration measured by the price index of different goods.",

            "text": "CO 2 marginal abatement cost is key to policy-making with regards carbon abatement, such as in the setting of CO 2 reduction targets, implementation of a nationwide carbon trading system, etc. Based on this study, some important policy implications arise. Firstly, implementation of a CO 2 trading system is beneficial for the improvement of the costeffectiveness of CO 2 abatement in China. According to the study, CO 2 marginal abatement costs range from 40 to 1200 RMB/ton among 30 provinces, therefore a nationwide carbon trading system is conducive to reducing the total abatement cost considering regional differences in MAC. Nowadays, a nationwide CO 2 trading system covering only 1700 power-generating firms has been established. There is no doubt it helps to improve the cost-effectiveness of CO 2 abatement in the power industry. Therefore, we suggest that a nationwide CO 2 trading system covering all industries should be established as soon as possible. Secondly, while establishing a nationwide CO 2 trading system, the carbon price is crucial. We suggest formulating different provincial carbon prices. Specifically, the carbon price in eastern provinces should be higher than that in western, and central, provinces. The results of the study could provide a more detailed reference for formulating specific provincial carbon price regimes, considering the reliability of the results compared to these of earlier studies. Thirdly, although regional economic integration contributes to the increase in CO 2 marginal abatement cost, Local Government should also encourage, and accelerate, the evolution of regional economic integration. The main reason is that an increase in CO 2 marginal abatement cost implies an increase in CO 2 emissions efficiency, more reasonable resource allocation, and technical progress, therefore regional economic integration actually accelerates technological progress and increases the potential reduction in CO 2 emissions. In particular, western, and central, provinces should accelerate the evolution of regional economic integration through more cooperation with other regions, trade, and the flow of technology.",
