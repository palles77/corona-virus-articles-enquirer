To determine whether the presence of this virus might be related to clinical symptoms, several patient groups were studied prospectively. In 8 of 16 (50%) homosexual males with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or unexplained lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS), coronavirus particles were found. In contrast, such particles were found in none of 18 heterosexual controls and in only 3 of 20 homosexual males without AIDS or LAS. Thus, coronavirus excretion correlated significantly (2c~<0.01) with the clinical diagnosis of AIDS or with syndromes belonging to the AIDS-related complex. In addition, such particles identified in the serum of one patient with LAS and diarrhea suggest invasion and systemic spread of the agent and underline that this virus behaves differently from\" common cold\" human coronaviruses.",

Considerable evidence has recently been accumulated with regard to the etiologic role of human T-lymphotropic retroviruses LAV/HTLV-III [1, 8, 9] . However, high prevalences of antibody to LAV/HTLV-III among homosexuals [5] suggest that the exposure to the virus is much more common than AIDS itself. Thus, host response to infection can be expected to range from subclinical to severe and may be influenced by concomitant infectious agents. Multiple intestinal parasitic infestations and other microbial infections are often seen in homosexual men [19] . In the search for viruses, we observed CVLP in the feces of homosexual men and report here on a prospective study for the presence of these particles in stool and serum specimens of patients belonging to a high risk group of AIDS.",

These tests are orthogonal contrasts a nonspecific irritation was observed. Lymph node histology in all cases with lymphadenopathy revealed follicular hyperplasia. The serological, parasitological and virological investigations are concluded in Table 2 . A high proportion of patients with AIDS or LAS revealed antibodies against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, cytomegatovirus, and syphilis, but so also did homosexuals not belonging to these groups. The parasitological stool investigations revealed that 40% to 70% of homosexual men harbor cysts either of apathogenic intestinal protozoa, i.e., Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba hartmanni, Endolimax nana, Jodamoeba buetschlii, or of pathogenic intestinal protozoa, i.e. Entamoeba histolytica or Giardia lamblia (Table 2) . By the negative staining technique, distinct particles were visualized electronmicroscopically in i 1 homosexual patients. These particles are to be classified as CVLP because of their typical pleomorphic appearance and their regular radiating projections (Figs. I and 2) . No other distinct structural entities resembling known viruses were found in any specimen. In order to distinguish the particles from cellular debris, the material was further characterized by CsC1 density gradient centrifugation. A buoyant density of 1.21 g/ml was observed for those particles which clearly identifies CVLP.

With the exception of the clear immunologic aberrations seen in patients with AIDS or LAS, most of the homosexual males were found to have markers of presumably sexually transmitted diseases to a similar extent. In 50% of the patients with AIDS or LAS, however, we found structurally distinct viral particles in the feces by the negative staining technique. They showed the typical morphology of coronaviruses characterized by a corona of widely spaced radiating projections [15, 16] and resembled a buoyant density (CsC1) of 1.21 g/ml characteristic of CVLP [12] . The sensitivity in detecting CVLP by our protocol of stool preparation and the EM exploration is not known. However, the observed frequency must be considered as a minimum because samples with low numbers of particles might have been overlooked by the EM method. 71 Human coronaviruses (strain 229 E and OC43) are associated with lower respiratory tract disease and are responsible for 15% of common colds [16] . These viruses are distributed world-wide and antibodies ware present with high prevalences [14, 22] . In addition,some human coronaviruses may be associated with enteric infections [2, 3, 13] . However, their causative role and their serological relationship to other human coronaviruses has not yet been demonstrated [25] . Two distinct groups of enteric coronaviruses can be differentiated: one is a minor group of enteric coronaviruses that has been reported from neonates associated with epidemic gastroenteritis [24] , and the other occurs in babies in nursery homes and causes a necrotizing ulcerocolitis [6] . The major group has been reported from many parts of the world in children and adults with gastrointestinal diseases, although a significant proportion of the unaffected population also shed these particles [3, 12] . It is deduced that coronavirus infection might become endemic under low standard of personal hygiene as there is a high incidence found in the rural population in Southern India [15] and among Australian aborigines [23] .",

The particular intimate contacts of homosexuals favor a fecal-oral route of transmission [19] . In epidemiologic studies it has been shown that the enteric coronaviruses are occasionally excreted in the feces over a long period of time (up to 85 months) [3] . This was also found in our patients with LAS or AIDS, even during potent antiviral therapy with rIFN ~A. However, the most striking finding was the presence of the virus in the blood of one patient with LAS and intermittent diarrhea. This illustrates that the organ tropism of most of the known animal or human coronaviruses [25] might not be present in the examined group of homosexual males. In contrast to acute infections caused by most of the known animal and human coronaviruses, some murine and feline types involve multiple organs and have a strong tendency to establish persistent and chronic diseases [10, 25] . It remains open to question whether the detection of CVLP in human feces and blood demonstrates the systemic spread and multiple organ tropism of an up until now unrecognized strain of the CVLP.",
