For from the beginning of his research career he was concerned with clarifying infectious disease mechanisms, with sorting out primary causes from epiphenomena, recognizing the complexities of etiological and epidemiological puzzles, and asking the questions whose answers would really help to bring insight and order. He had particular talent for perceiving patterns and interrelationships, and for noticing -seeing something new even in long-studied systems. To cite just two examples -one from his very first, and one from his last, singleauthor research paper:",

Rowe was the first to suggest a direct correlation between the pathology of a disease and the host's immune response (1,2), now known in the case of LCM to be a T-lymphocyte mediated phenomenon (3). And in a paper finished in early 1983, he described a unique pathological consequence of exogenous infection of young mice with certain murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs), in which the whiskers of infected mice become deformed: curved, shortened, and sparse (4). I can't guess how many Friend-helper or Moloney MuLV infected mice had been examined previously by investigators all over the world without this really striking effect being remarked upon.",

Huebner, for whom he felt and often expressed unending gratitude and respect, and later as Chief of his own laboratory, the Laboratory of Viral Diseases, in NIAID. From just the point of view of research related in some way to laboratory rodents, the area in which significant studies were performed is remarkably broad: Of 15 infectious agents or groups of agents to be covered in this conference, Wally worked with 13, plus one or two not mentioned in the program.",

Wally was a directing or supporting force in studies in which previously undescribed mouse representatives of the adenovirus (5), herpes virus (6), and reovirus (7) groups, were isolated and characterized; and serological and tissue culture assay systems for many murine viruses including polyoma and K viruses, mouse hepatitis virus, Sendai virus, minute virus of mice, and mouse adenovirus, were developed (8-13).",
