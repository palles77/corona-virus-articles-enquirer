By 2 years of age, 91% of children experienced at least one episode of MEE. Children who develop their first episode of AOM before 6 months of age are more likely to develop recurrent disease [6] . In addition to young age, risk factors often associated with frequent episodes of AOM include male gender, race (eg, Native Americans), genetic predisposition (eg, siblings with frequent AOM), underlying medical conditions (eg, cleft palate), low socioeconomic status, daycare attendance, exposure to cigarette smoke in the household, and lack of breast feeding [5, 6] .",

In addition, serum antibodies transudate into the middle ear cavity, protecting it against specific bacterial pathogens [8] . These defenses may be disrupted by respiratory viruses, leading to impairment of ET function. In a chinchilla model, influenza A caused epithelial damage and accumulation of cellular and mucus debris in the lumen of the ET and subsequent negative middle ear pressure [9] . Similar evidence of ET dysfunction has been substantiated in studies of children. Abnormal tympanograms occurred in 75% of children with clinical symptoms of an upper respiratory infection (URI), and 97% of the abnormalities were detected by the 4th day of illness [10] .",

These viruses cause eustachian tube dysfunction that is critical to the pathogenesis of AOM. Vaccines against these viruses would likely reduce the incidence of AOM. In three previous studies, influenza virus vaccines reduced the incidence of AOM by 30% to 36%. Vaccines to prevent infections with RSV and PIV type 3 are undergoing clinical testing at this time. Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), and Moraxella catarrhalis are the three most common AOM pathogens. Heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is effective in preventing invasive disease and AOM caused by serotypes contained in the vaccine.

Strict case definitions were used to diagnose AOM and MEE using pneumatic otoscopy, tympanometry, spectral gradient acoustic reflectometry, and videootoscopy with computer capture images of the tympanic membrane saved in an electronic database. To detect influenza disease, viral throat cultures were obtained with each febrile respiratory illness or AOM. Also, nasopharyngeal colonization with penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae was monitored throughout the trial.",

Cell-surface antigens of NTHi that may be used in vaccines include outer membrane proteins (OMPs), high molecular weight (HMW) proteins, pili, and fimbriae. Six major OMPs of NTHi have been labeled P1 through P6 in order of decreasing molecular weights [43] . Bactericidal activity of antibody to some of these proteins has been demonstrated, but their ability to protect against infection or enhance clearance of organisms in animal models has been variable. Some OMPs demonstrate significant heterogeneity between strains, limiting their usefulness as vaccine candidates. The greatest interest has focused on P6 because it is surface exposed, immunogenic, and highly conserved among strains of NTHi. P6 has been shown to induce bactericidal antibody that enhances pulmonary clearance of homologous and heterologous NTHi in animal models [44] . However, children prone to frequent episodes of AOM may not recognize P6 as an effective immunogen [45] . HMW proteins and pili are important for attachment of NTHi to respiratory epithelium. Immunization of chinchillas with HMW proteins and pili has provided some degree of protection against AOM. Passive antibody to P5 and protein D protected chinchillas against AOM and MEE due to NTHi [46] .",

OMPs and LOS are fairly well conserved across many strains. The chinchilla has been inadequate for evaluation of vaccine candidates to M. catarrhalis, and it has not been shown that antibodies to these antigens are protective against the development of AOM. Kyd et al. [48] have developed a murine model demonstrating enhanced pulmonary clearance of M. catarrhalis following mucosal immunization with killed organisms. Ubiquitous surface protein A elicits bactericidal antibodies in animals, immunized mice clear M. catarrhalis more quickly from the respiratory tract, adult humans have high titers of antibody to this protein, and clinical trials with this protein are in progress [49] . CD is a porin OMP that enhances pulmonary clearance of M. catarrhalis in mice, but no clinical studies have been conducted. Other surface antigens of M. catarrhalis are being evaluated as potential vaccine candidates, but there is much to be learned about their function and the activity of their respective antibodies.",

The incidence and cost of treating AOM have increased significantly in recent years. Antibiotic resistance has become widespread in all regions of the United States. Use of effective vaccines is the most costefficient way to prevent AOM. Viral vaccines can be used to prevent URIs that commonly precede AOM. Influenza virus vaccine reduces the incidence of AOM by approximately one third during the influenza season, but the vaccine is not currently recommended for all children. Future vaccines for RSV and PIV should have even greater effects on reducing the incidence of AOM. Bacterial vaccines are also needed to prevent AOM. Recently licensed PCV will significantly reduce AOM caused by serotypes contained in the vaccine, but protein-based vaccines are needed to cover all strains of pneumococci. Vaccines to prevent AOM caused by NTHi and M. catarrhalis are under development.",
