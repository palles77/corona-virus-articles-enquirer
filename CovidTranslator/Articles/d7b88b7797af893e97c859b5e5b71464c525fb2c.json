The DC family is heterogeneous and is classically divided into two main subsets, each with its unique phenotypic and functional characteristics: myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). Recent results have provided intriguing evidence that both DC subsets can also function as direct cytotoxic effector cells; in particular, against cancer cells. In this review, we delve into this understudied function of human DCs and discuss why these so-called killer DCs might become important tools in future cancer immunotherapies.",

Although the nomenclature of the DC system is still evolving and novel markers to identify and subclassify DCs are being continually identified, it is well established that the DC family constitutes a heterogeneous group of cells that can be categorized in two main subtypes: mDCs and pDCs. Despite the considerable heterogeneity between the different DC types in terms of phenotype, gene expression profile, and function, a common characteristic of all DCs is their capacity for antigen presentation and their unique ability to prime and activate na\u00efve T lymphocytes. As the primary APCs of the immune system, DCs are pivotal in eliciting adaptive immune responses and, as such, in determining the balance between immunity and tolerance [1] . In addition to their central role in adaptive immunity, DCs also occupy a pre-eminent place within the innate immune system. In this context, DCs express Tolllike receptors (TLRs); a family of innate immune receptors involved in sensing viruses and other microbial stimuli.",

Through their role in the induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and through their capacity to harness the cytotoxic activity of innate immune cells (NK cells, NKT cells, and gd T cells), DCs can elicit potent cytotoxic immune responses towards tumor cells [2] . Evidence from animal and human studies indicates that DCs themselves can initiate cytotoxic effector function through which they directly contribute to tumor cell killing. These so-called killer DCs were first described in the mid-1990s, when a population of murine DCs was identified with the capacity to lyse CD4 + T cells in a FAS\u00c0FAS ligand (FAS-L)-dependent fashion [3] . Almost one decade later, three research groups independently reported on the existence of a novel DC type within the murine immune system that bore phenotypic, molecular, and functional characteristics of both DCs and NK cells [4] [5] [6] . This DC subtype was termed natural killer dendritic cell (NKDC) or, alternatively, interferon-producing killer DC (IKDC) [4] because of its NK cell-like properties such as cytotoxic activity and capacity to produce high amounts of interferon (IFN)-g [4] [5] [6] . Although NKDCs were capable of antigen processing and presentation, it soon became apparent that this term was actually a misnomer because NKDCs belong to the NK cell lineage and not to the DC lineage [7] [8] [9] . This apparently erroneous terminology has led to confusion and even skepticism over the actual existence of killer DCs.",

These killer DCs, which have been identified in both rodents and humans, appear to constitute a heterogeneous population of cells that have the following characteristics in common: (i) they are endowed with direct cytolytic potential; (ii) they fulfill the phenotypic and functional criteria to be classified as bona fide DCs; and (iii) they cannot be defined as NK cells despite their cytotoxic activity (e.g., absence of classical NK cell surface markers, and target cell profile different from that of NK cells). Here, we summarize the findings accumulated in recent years on killer DCs and discuss the potential relevance of these cells to future immunotherapy strategies. No major differences in mode of action have been identified between rodent and human killer DCs, and because the existence and function of rodent killer DCs has been excellently reviewed elsewhere [10, 11] , we focus this discussion on killer DCs in humans.",

            "text": "Monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) as killer cells Immature DCs reside mostly in parts of the body that are in close contact with the outside world, such as skin and mucosal tissue, and are able quickly to sense and take up pathogens that could harm the host. After pathogen recognition, the DCs mature and migrate to lymphoid tissues to present the pathogenic peptides to T cells. MoDCs are by far the most widely used cell type for the study of human DCs ex vivo (Table 1) . Although a variety of protocols exist to generate MoDCs, the basic procedure consists of two phases: (i) monocytes are differentiated into immature DCs using a combination of cytokines [e.g., granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-4, IL-15 or IFNa]; and (ii) MoDC maturation is induced with activation stimuli (e.g., proinflammatory cytokines or TLR ligands). Immature DCs exploit a wide variety of pattern recognition receptors to recognize and take up antigens. Several of these differentiating and maturating agents can trigger human MoDCs to acquire a cytotoxic effector function. Different studies have suggested that this cytolytic potential already resides in the monocytic precursor cell compartment (Table 1) . Indeed, human CD14 + as well as CD16 + monocytes stimulated with type I or II IFN, R848 a ligand for TLR7 and TLR8, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) a ligand for TLR4, were shown to exert antitumor activity against a range of cancer cell lines [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] (Table 1 ). In three of these studies, TNF-a-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was implicated in the direct tumoricidal activity of human monocytes [12, 13, 15] . TRAIL-dependent apoptosis has also been reported to play a role in the cytotoxic activity of human MoDCs. Viruses, including measles virus [18, 19] , cytomegalovirus (CMV) [20] , and HIV-1 [21] [22] [23] , TLR ligands (double-stranded RNA), type I IFNs [24] [25] [26] , IL-15 [27] , and the maturating agent CD40L [28] , are all capable of inducing TRAIL expression in MoDCs (Table 1) . Conversely, another study found that CD40 ligation inhibits TRAIL expression in MoDCs, but the cytotoxic ability of these CD40L-matured MoDCs was preserved, suggesting TRAIL-independent mechanisms for induction of cell death [28] . Indeed, as outlined in Table 1 , both cell contact-dependent and -independent mechanisms have been implicated in MoDC-mediated killing and their cytolytic armamentarium includes, in addition to TRAIL, a broad range of cytotoxic effector molecules such as TNFa [21] [22] [23] [24] 29, 30] , FAS-L [20] [21] [22] 29, 31, 32] , caspase-8 [19, [33] [34] [35] , lymphotoxin (LT)-a1b2 [29] , TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) [21] , IFN-g [28] , granzyme B [27, 36] , and programmed death ligand (PD-L1/2) [32, 37] .",

This observation was made in several studies ( Table 1) ; all of which were performed in the context of infectious diseases [21, 32, 37] . The first study demonstrated that MoDCs infected with measles virus can induce paracrine killing of autologous T cells [19] . Monocytes [38] and MoDCs [21] exposed to HIV-1 were capable of inducing apoptosis of HIV-1-infected as well as noninfected CD4 + T cells from either allogeneic or autologous origin. In another study, it was shown that LPS-matured MoDCs derived from tuberculosis patients had an increased expression of PD-L1, which underlined their antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity towards both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [37] . Similarly, LPS-matured MoDCs generated from chronic hepatitis C patients were found to lyse both healthy (allogeneic) as well as patient-derived (autologous) CD4 + T cells in a PD-L2-and FAS-L-dependent fashion [32] . Taken together, these findings indicate that human monocytes and MoDCs, when appropriately stimulated, can function as cytotoxic antitumor effectors and, in the context of chronic infection, also as immunoregulatory cells with T cell killing activity.",

            "text": "Although the observation that ex vivo generated MoDCs can act as direct killer cells is interesting, another relevant question is whether this is also applicable to naturally circulating DCs. Although most studies used MoDCs, several studies have delved into the killer function of blood DCs and have shown that the two main blood DC subsets, mDCs and pDCs, can be cytotoxic. The human blood mDC subset is usually defined as lineage (Lin) -HLA-DR + CD11c + CD123(IL-3Ra) dim cells. Blood mDCs can be further subdivided in nonoverlapping subsets based on the expression of blood dendritic cell antigen (BDCA)-1 (CD1c) and BDCA-3 (CD141) [39] . Classically, mDCs remain in an immature state and migrate from peripheral tissues to lymph nodes after maturation where they can activate T cells. Cytotoxic potential has hitherto been reported for the total CD11c + mDC population, as well as for the CD1c + subset ( Table 2 ). The first description of the direct cytotoxic activity of human blood mDCs dates back to the late 1990s, where CD11c + mDCs, stimulated with IFNa or IFNg, directly lysed various tumor cell lines in a TRAIL-dependent fashion [40] . TRAIL has also been implicated in blood DC-mediated cytotoxicity in two other studies [41, 42] (Table 2). By contrast, TRAIL seems not to be an important mediator of cytotoxicity by TLR-activated mDCs. A recent study showed that neither BDCA-1 + nor BDCA-3 + mDCs produce TRAIL after exposure to TLR ligands [43] . In line with this, it was observed that tumor-infiltrating CD11c + mDCs express and secrete perforin and granzyme B, but not TRAIL, upon TLR7 and TLR8 stimulation [44] .",

Taken together, these data illustrate that killer mDCs, like their in vitro MoDC counterparts, can exploit a variety of cytotoxic effector mechanisms to exert killing function (Table  2) . Similar to MoDCs, most studies on the killer function of native blood mDCs have been performed using tumor cell lines as target cells. The ability of blood mDCs to kill T cells was examined in one study that showed LPS-activated BDCA-1 + mDCs from chronic hepatitis C patients induced lysis of autologous patient T cells as well as allogeneic healthy T cells in a FAS-L-and PD-L2-dependent fashion ( Table 2 ) [32] . This study provides evidence for the ability of native blood mDCs to kill T cells during chronic viral infection; a mechanism that may be exploited by viruses to escape antiviral T cells.",

            "text": "pDCs as killer cells pDCs are defined as Lin -D11c -CD4 + CD45RA + IL-3Ra(C-D123) + ILT3 + cells. Additionally, the markers BDCA-2 (CD303), BDCA-4 (CD304), and immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT)7 are restricted to pDCs both in peripheral blood and bone marrow [46] . On the functional level, human pDCs differ from other DC subsets by their ability to produce large amounts of type I IFNs upon TLR7 or TLR9 ligation by viral or bacterial components [47] . pDCs are generally found to circulate in the periphery, however they can infiltrate tissue in case of infection, inflammation, or tumor [44, 48] . Like their myeloid counterparts, pDCs are also described to exert a direct cytotoxic function ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ). For example, the human pDC cell line GEN2.2 is capable of lysing tumor cells in a partly TRAIL-dependent manner after stimulation with inactivated influenza virus or type I IFNs (Table 2 ). This pDC cell line expresses the NK cell surface marked CD56, whereas other NK cell markers are absent [49] . pDCs activated by the tick-borne encephalitis vaccine FMSE also upregulate CD56, whereas IL-3 or several TLR agonists do not induce upregulation [50] . The CD56 + pDCs express high amounts of TRAIL and granzyme B but neither the cytotoxic molecules nor CD56 are required for the observed cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, the killing capacity is dependent on cell-to-cell contact, whereby FSME-pDCs specifically lyse MHC-class-I-negative tumor cell lines Daudi and K562, but not MHC class I positive cell lines [50] . By contrast, pDCs stimulated with imiquimod (a TLR7 agonist and to lesser extend TLR8 agonist), CpG, or IFNa kill MHC-class-I-positive tumor cells in a TRAIL-and contact-dependent manner [44, 51] . Although TRAIL appears to be an important mediator of pDC-mediated cytotoxicity, other cytotoxic effector molecules are implicated (Table 2) . It has been shown that different cytotoxic effector molecules are expressed by blood pDCs, including TRAIL, granzyme B, and lysozyme. High lysozyme expression by the CD2 high pDC subset has been observed, although this is not related to the increased cytotoxic activity of the CD2 high pDCs as compared to their CD2 low counterparts. It is important to note that the high lysozyme expression in the CD2 high pDC subset could not be confirmed in another independently performed study [51] , indicating that other mechanisms, such as the superior ability of Chronic hepatitis C patients. c Abbreviations: ADCC, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; CB, cord blood; E: T ratio, effector cell to target cell ratio; FADD, FAS-associated protein with death domain; HPV, human papillomavirus; ND, not determined; PB, peripheral blood; TGF, transforming growth factor.",

            "text": "Killer DCs in the war on cancer Indirect cytotoxic effects of pDC-derived type I IFNs pDCs are generally accepted as the major type I IFNproducing cells of the immune system. These type I IFNs can initiate protective immunity through maturation of mDCs and subsequent activation of T cells and NK cells (reviewed in [60] ). Thereby, pDCs may play a central role in inducing indirect cytotoxic activity against tumors via various pathways, for example, apoptosis induction and anti-angiogenesis via signaling through a common IFNa receptor. Furthermore, the direct inhibitory effects on tumor cell growth/functions were thought to be the major mechanisms in the antitumor response in IFN-treated patients. In fact, IFNa can directly inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, and can exert other direct effects on tumor cells (Figure 2 ) [61] . Next to a direct cytotoxic and cytostatic effect, IFNa also has wide stimulatory effects on other immune cells. As discussed above, monocytes can differentiate into killer DCs under the control of IFNa. In addition, recent studies have shown that IFNa also improves mDC survival and the capacity to store and process exogenous antigens, leading to enhanced cross-presentation and cross-priming of antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses [62, 63] . In vivo evidence was recently provided by two independent studies showing that, in mice, type I IFNs were critical for the induction of antitumor immune responses [62, 64] . Furthermore, type I IFNs can regulate NK cell function, by enhancing the of NK cells to kill target cells and to produce IFNg [65] . Also, type I IFNs promote the accumulation and/or survival of proliferating NK cells by the type I IFN and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1-dependent induction of IL-15 [65] .",

Nevertheless, some studies have shown tumor regression upon treatment with several TLR agonists, such as CpG or imiquimod. Stary et al. have shown that, upon treatment of basal cell carcinoma patients with imiquimod, mDCs and pDCs are recruited to the tumor site and express cytotoxic effector molecules [44] . In a mouse model of transplantable melanoma, treatment with imiquimod led to tumor clearance in a manner dependent on production of chemokine CC ligand (CCL)2 by mast cells. CCL2 induced the massive recruitment of pDCs into the skin, leading to a pDC-dependent reduced melanoma growth [73] . In another study, treatment of human basal cell carcinoma with imiquimod resulted in tumor regression by recruiting pDCs that specifically lysed the tumor cells expressing TRAIL receptor 1 in a TRAIL-dependent manner, and mDCs that expressed granzyme B [44] . The fact that pDCs only lysed cells expressing TRAILR1 indicates that these cells have the capacity to act as anticancer effector cells, thereby showing potential as targets for tumor clearance. These data suggest that tumor-infiltrating DCs can act as killer cells that are directly involved in tumor clearance. A recent study demonstrated that depletion of unactivated pDCs in an orthotopic mammary tumor model delayed tumor growth; however, in the same model, intratumoral administration of a TLR7 agonist led to pDCand type-I-IFN-dependent tumor regression [74] . These findings point to a Janus-faced function of tumor infiltrating pDCs, and suggest that their function can be largely determined by context and activation state.",

Many research efforts are currently being undertaken to improve the clinical efficacy of DC-based cancer immunotherapy protocols. Thus far, virtually all clinical trials were based on ex vivo generated DCs, either derived from monocytes or CD34 + progenitor cells.

Both IL-15 and IFNa differentiated CD56 + MoDCs were found to be efficient stimulators of antigenspecific T cell responses [26, 27] . Human pDCs also have the capacity to present antigens and be potent stimulators of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses [2, 50, 76] . The high effector: target ratios that are required to detect killing activity argue in favor of a more predominant role for DCs in the acquisition and presentation of antigens rather than a role as effector cells capable of killing of tumor or virusinfected cells.",

We propose that DCs, and pDCs in particular, present a promising target for immunotherapy because they infiltrate tumor lesions and are, upon activation, capable of specifically kill tumor cells, either directly or via activation of other cytotoxic effector cells. However, many questions remain before killer DCs Figure 2 . Indirect cytotoxicity of human killer DC subsets. Antigen-loaded killer DCs have the ability to activate antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells that in turn can lyse target cells. Whether killer DCs also have the ability to cross-present antigens obtained from killed target cells and thereafter cross-prime cytotoxic T cells is unclear. Furthermore, human pDCs produce large amounts of type I IFNs upon stimulation and, next to a direct cytotoxic effect, can exert indirect cytotoxic effects by: (i) activating NK cells; (ii) enhancing antigen cross-presentation and crosspriming of T cells; and (iii) generating of IFNa-induced killer MoDCs/mDCs.
