Although N-terminal acetylation modulates diverse protein functions, little is known about its roles in virus replication. We found that NatB, which comprises NAA20 and NAA25, is involved in the shutoff activity of influenza virus PA-X. The shutoff activity of PA-X was suppressed in NatB-deficient cells, and PA-X mutants that are not acetylated by NatB showed reduced shutoff activities. We also evaluated the importance of N-terminal acetylation of PA, because PA-X shares its N-terminal sequence with PA. Viral polymerase activity was reduced in NatB-deficient cells. Moreover, mutant PAs that are not acetylated by NatB lost their function in the viral polymerase complex. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation is required for the shutoff activity of PA-X and for viral polymerase activity.",

            "text": "Posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, N-terminal acetylation, and lysine acetylation modulate cellular biological activities. Phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and lysine acetylation modify the target protein to switch on and off of its function after protein biosynthesis (Hunter, 1995; Pickart, 2001; Yang and Seto, 2008) . Unlike these posttranslational modifications, N-terminal acetylation of target proteins occurs during protein biosynthesis (Aksnes et al., 2016) . N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), which include NatA through NatF, preferentially acetylate the N-terminal amino acid of 80% of cellular proteins (Aksnes et al., 2016; Starheim et al., 2012) . Therefore, N-terminal acetylation appears to be one of the major posttranslational modifications in cells. Despite its prevalence among proteins, N-terminal acetylation has not been extensively studied, and its importance has been evaluated in only a limited number of proteins such as Ubc12 (Scott et al., 2011 (Scott et al., , 2017 , Rgs2 (Park et al., 2015) , a-synuclein (Kang et al., 2012; Miotto et al., 2015) , Hsp90 (Oh et al., 2017) , tropomyosin (Singer and Shaw, 2003) , and Arl3p (Behnia et al., 2004) . Consequently, the roles of N-terminal acetylation are not fully understood.",

PA-X, which is expressed from the PA mRNA via a ribosomal frameshift (Firth et al., 2012) , cleaves host mRNAs via its endonuclease activity to suppress host protein expression . The shutoff activity of PA-X inhibits interferon (IFN)-b production and antiviral antibody production in vivo and modulates virus pathogenicity in mice (Gao et al., 2015; Hayashi et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016; Jagger et al., 2012) . The N-terminal endonuclease active site, which is common to both PA and PA-X, and the C-terminal basic amino acids that are unique to PA-X are important for the shutoff activity of PA-X (Desmet et al., 2013; Jagger et al., 2012; Oishi et al., 2015) . PA-X selectively cleaves RNA transcripts derived from the cellular Pol II promotor (Khaperskyy et al., 2016) .

            "text": "N-Terminal Acetylation by NatB Is Essential for the Shutoff Activity of PA-X in Yeast Many viruses, including influenza A virus, encode viral proteins that interfere with host protein expression (Glaunsinger and Ganem, 2004; Nemeroff et al., 1998; Sadek and Read, 2016; Terada et al., 2017) . Although a number of host proteins have been linked to the shutoff activity of various viruses (Gaglia et al., 2012; Kamitani et al., 2006; Nemeroff et al., 1998) , the host protein or proteins that contribute to the shutoff activity of PA-X remain unknown. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) is a powerful model organism for studying fundamental aspects of eukaryotic cell biology. Therefore, it has been broadly utilized as a model for aging, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, the cell cycle, metabolism, and neurodegenerative disorders (Draetta and Beach, 1988; Ferretti et al., 2017; Graf et al., 2017; P\u00e9 li-Gulli et al., 2017; Roychoudhury et al., 2017; Zuehlke et al., 2017) . By using yeast single-gene deletion libraries, several groups have revealed host-pathogen interactions (Matsuda et al., 2012; Naito et al., 2007; Panavas et al., 2005; Tomita et al., 2011) . To examine whether a yeast single-gene knockout library could be used to identify host genes that contribute to the shutoff activity of PA-X, we attempted to express PA-X in yeast. Wild-type yeast strain BY4347 was transformed with an empty plasmid, or a plasmid encoding wild-type PA-X, or PA-X K134A, which lacks shutoff activity (Hayashi et al., 2015) . Transformed yeast harboring the empty or PA-X K134A-expressing plasmid formed colonies. In contrast, yeast transformed with the plasmid encoding wild-type PA-X hardly formed colonies ( Figure 1A) . These results suggest that PA-X suppresses yeast growth via its shutoff activity.

To screen the yeast knockout library, each knockout yeast strain was transformed with a plasmid encoding wild-type PA-X or an empty plasmid, which served as a transformation control ( Figure 1B ). When a knockout yeast strain that was transformed with the plasmid encoding PA-X formed a similar number of colonies to that transformed with the empty plasmid, the host gene lacking in the yeast strain would be required for the shutoff activity of PA-X ( Figure 1B ). Using this screening approach, two knockout yeast strains, DNat3 and DMdm20, were selected as candidates because many colonies emerged. One or two colonies were found in 125 knockout yeast strains transformed with the plasmid encoding wild-type PA-X, whereas more than 1,000 colonies were found in the DNat3 and DMdm20 yeast strains. Upon examination of the PA-X sequences recovered from the single colonies of the 125 knockout yeast strains, we found that 96 clones did not express PA-X and 29 clones harbored plasmids encoding PA-X with an unintended mutation that reduced the shutoff activity of PA-X (Oishi et al., 2018) . To confirm the result, wild-type, DNat3, and DMdm20 yeast strains were again transformed with the empty plasmid or the plasmid encoding wild-type PA-X or PA-X K134A, and then tested for their growth on a selection plate. As expected, DNat3 and DMdm20 grew even when they were transformed with the PA-X-expressing plasmid, whereas the wild-type yeast did not grow when it was transformed with a wild-type PA-X, but did grow when transformed with the PA-X K134A-expressing plasmid ( Figure 1C , left). To exclude the possibility that the growth was caused by a defect in PA-X expression, the expression of wild-type PA-X in DNat3 and DMdm20 was examined by western blotting. The expression of PA-X in DNat3 was slightly lower than that of PA-X K134A, whereas in DMdm20, the expression of PA-X was comparable to that of PA-X K134A (Figure 1C) . We consistently detected double bands in yeast that expressed wild-type or mutant PA-X for an unknown reason. These data indicate that Nat3 and Mdm20 individually play roles in the shutoff activity of PA-X in yeast.",

Each NAT family member preferentially catalyzes the N-terminal acetylation of the N-terminal amino acid of its target proteins. NatB prefers to acetylate proteins beginning with Met-Asp, Met-Glu, and Met-Asn in yeast and mammals (Aksnes et al., 2016; Van Damme et al., 2012) . PA-X starts with Met-Glu. Therefore, we hypothesized that PA-X must be N-terminally acetylated by NatB for its shutoff activity. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a series of plasmids encoding PA-X mutants, which possessed a NatB-permissive substitution at the second amino acid of E to D (PA-X E2D), to N (PA-X E2N), or to A (PA-X E2A), which is recognized by NatA, but not NatB, or to P (PA-X E2P), which should be unacetylated based on a previous report (Starheim et al., 2012) . Wild-type, DNat3, or DMdm20 yeast strains were transformed with an empty plasmid or the series of PA-X plasmids and spotted onto the selection plate. The wild-type yeast strain transformed with the plasmid encoding wild-type PA-X, PA-X E2D, or PA-X E2N barely formed any colonies, whereas wild-type yeast transformed with the plasmid encoding PA-X E2A or PA-X E2P formed many colonies (Figure 1D, top, left side) , indicating that PA-X E2A and PA-X E2P have lower shutoff activity compared with wild-type PA-X. The knockout yeast strains, DNat3 and DMdm20, efficiently grew regardless of the plasmid with which they were transformed ( Figure 1D , middle and bottom, left side). Western blotting revealed that the expression of the PA-X mutants in DNat3 or DMdm20 was comparable to that of wild-type PA-X ( Figure 1D ). These data demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation by the NatB complex of Nat3p and Mdm20p is essential for the shutoff activity of PA-X in yeast.",

            "text": "Because N-terminal acetylation by NatB is essential for the shutoff activity of PA-X in yeast, we asked whether NatB has a similar role in mammalian cells. To this end, we attempted to establish NAA20-knockout (NAA20-KO) and NAA25-knockout (NAA25-KO) cell lines by using HAP1 cells (we used HAP1 because it is a human haploid cell line from which it is easy to generate complete knockout cells) and the CRISPR/Cas9 approach: NAA20 and NAA25 are the human homologs of yeast Nat3 and Mdm20, respectively. We obtained 9 NAA20-KO and 11 NAA25-KO clones; we arbitrarily chose one clone from each group and used those clones for most of the experiments. NAA20 was not detected in NAA20-KO cells ( Figure 2A ). In NAA25-KO cells, neither NAA25 or NAA20 was detected (Figure 2A) , as previously described (Starheim et al., 2008) . Using these cells, together with their parental cells, we compared the shutoff activity of wild-type PA-X by using a luciferase-based shutoff assay (Desmet et al., 2013; Hayashi et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2015; Nogales et al., 2017; Oishi et al., 2015) . Briefly, wild-type, NAA20-KO, or NAA25-KO cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase together with an empty plasmid or a plasmid encoding wild-type PA-X, and firefly luciferase activities were then measured at 24 hr post-transfection. The shutoff activity was calculated as the ratio of luciferase activity in the empty plasmid-transfected samples to that in the PA-X-expressing samples and is shown as relative values. The shutoff activities of wild-type PA-X in NAA20-KO and NAA25-KO cells were lower than that in wild-type HAP1 cells ( Figure 2B ). Usually, the expression of wild-type PA-X is suppressed by its own shutoff activity (Oishi et al., 2015) . However, when the shutoff activity of PA-X was decreased, the expression of PA-X conversely increased. To evaluate the shutoff activity from this aspect, we compared the expression of PA-X in transfected cells. The expression of PA-X in NAA20-KO and NAA25-KO cells was higher than that in wild-type HAP1 cells ( Figure 2B ). Similar results were also obtained by using the other eight NAA20-KO and 10 NAA25-KO clones. Together, these results indicate that NAA20 and NAA25 are important for the shutoff activity of PA-X in mammalian cells. To further confirm that the reduction in PA-X shutoff activity was due to the loss of NAA20 or NAA25 expression, NAA20-KO or NAA25-KO cells were transfected with plasmids expressing firefly luciferase and wild-type PA-X together with NAA20 or NAA25. In NAA20-KO or NAA25-KO cells, low levels of NAA20 or NAA25, respectively, were detected when the expression plasmid for each protein was co-transfected; under these conditions, the shutoff activity of wild-type PA-X increased ( Figure 2C ). In wild-type HAP1 cells, the shutoff activity of wild-type PA-X was not affected by co-expression with NAA20 or NAA25 ( Figure 2C ). These results confirm that the human NatB components, NAA20 and NAA25, are important for the shutoff activity of PA-X in mammalian cells.",

The mass spectrometry revealed that all detected N-terminal peptides of wild-type PA-X were N-terminally acetylated ( Figure 2D ). NatB acetylates the N-terminal first methionine (Starheim et al., 2012) ; consistent with this report, the first methionine was acetylated in all detected N-terminal peptides of PA-X (Table S1 ).

We analyzed the amino acid sequences of PA deposited in the Influenza Research Databases in April 2017 and found that 99.7% of H1N1pdm09 viruses (10,235/10,265 isolates), 99.9% of H3N2 viruses (12,899/12,904 isolates), and all H5N1 (2,382/2,382 isolates) and H7N9 (737/737 isolates) viruses have glutamic acid (E) as the second amino acid ( Figure 4A ). This high conservation supports the concept that N-terminal acetylation of PA-X by NatB is required for its shutoff activity. To experimentally demonstrate the importance of N-terminal acetylation by NatB in PA-X derived from H1N1pdm09, H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 viruses, we performed shutoff assays in NAA20-KO and NAA25-KO cells. The shutoff activities of all tested PA-Xs in NAA20-KO or NAA25-KO cells were lower than those in wild-type cells ( Figure 4B ). These findings indicate that N-terminal acetylation is also important for the shutoff activity of PA-X derived from other subtypes of influenza virus.",

At 24 hr post-transfection (hpi), a dual luciferase assay was performed to calculate viral polymerase activities on the basis of the ratio of firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity. Under conditions where the expression of wild-type PA and Renilla luciferase in the three tested cell types were comparable, viral polymerase activities in NAA20-KO or NAA25-KO cells were significantly reduced compared with that in wild-type cells ( Figure 5A ), demonstrating that NatB also plays a role in the viral polymerase activity. Because PA-X is expressed via ribosomal frameshift from the plasmid encoding wild-type PA used in the minigenome assay, we examined its effect on the minigenome assay by using a plasmid that encodes mutant PA (PA FS); this plasmid expresses wild-type PA but the expression of PA-X via the ribosomal frameshift is decreased to one-seventh of wild-type PA levels . The polymerase activity of PA FS in wild-type cells was comparable to that of wild-type PA ( Figure S2A ). In NAA20-KO and NAA25-KO cells, the polymerase activity of the PA FS mutant was reduced similarly to wild-type PA ( Figure S2B ). These results suggest that our minigenome assay is not affected by PA-X expressed via the ribosomal frameshift.",

The NatB acetylates N-terminal amino acids in proteins that start with M-E, -D, or -N (Starheim et al., 2012) . Phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and lysine acetylation modify target proteins to regulate biological activities, whereas N-terminal acetylation stably modifies the target during protein biosynthesis (Aksnes et al., 2016) . Over 80% of proteins are acetylated at the N terminus by NAT family members, including NatA through NatF, which preferentially acetylate the N-terminal amino acid (Aksnes et al., 2016; Starheim et al., 2012) . Although N-terminal acetylation is a fundamental modification, it is not fully understood, except for its functions in a small number of proteins, for example the binding of the ubiquitin enzyme E2 Ubc12 to scaffold-type E3 ligase Dcn1 (Scott et al., 2017; Scott et al., 2011) , stabilization of Rgs2 (Park et al., 2015) , and maintenance of actomyosin fiber (Van Damme et al., 2012) .

Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured by using a dual-luciferase assay. Viral polymerase activity was calculated by normalization of the firefly luciferase activity to the Renilla luciferase activity. The expression of PA, Renilla luciferase, and b-actin was analyzed by western blotting using anti-PA, anti-Renilla luciferase, and anti-b-actin antibodies.

Moreover, N-terminal acetylation of host proteins by NatB may be involved in viral polymerase activity, virus growth, and shutoff activity because this activity was diminished in NAA20-KO and NAA25-KO cells. Further analysis is required to clarify the importance of NatB especially in virus replication, because NatB also contributes to a wide range of host functions.

Although the shutoff activity of PA-X E2N was lower than that of wild-type PA-X, the polymerase activity of PA E2N was higher than that of wild-type PA ( Figures 3A and 5C ), indicating that the effect of the second amino acid on the shutoff activity of PA-X could be different from its effect on the polymerase activity. Further analysis is needed to elucidate the mechanism of the effects of this amino acid on the polymerase and shutoff activities. In these mutagenesis analyses, PA-X E2A showed an interesting phenotype: it showed reduced shutoff activity, but was recognized by NatA and was N-terminally acetylated at the second amino acid residue after removal of the first methionine. These results indicate that the shutoff activity of PA-X is not solely regulated by N-terminal acetylation. Our data suggest that both the second amino acid residue of PA-X and N-terminal acetylation by NatB play important roles in the shutoff activity of PA-X. PA-X has an acetylated first methionine at its N terminus (Table S1 ). However, although the N terminus of PA-X E2A and PA-X E2P is acetylated, their first methionine is removed and the second residue of alanine and proline, respectively, is acetylated. Thus, although both PA-X and PA-X E2A are N-terminally acetylated, their N-terminal structures may be different, which may affect the shutoff activity.",

Although the suppression mechanisms are varied among viral proteins, the viral proteins of herpes simplex, SARS corona, Epstein-Barr, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes viruses directly cleave mRNA via their endonuclease activity (Gaglia et al., 2012) . Their N-terminal sequences do not match the N-terminal sequences recognized by NatB. Therefore, N-terminal acetylation by NatB is unlikely to be responsible for the shutoff activity of these viruses. However, L proteins of bunya, arena, and hanta viruses, which also have endonuclease activity for cap-snatching, all contain conserved N-terminal sequences that are recognized by NatB (Morin et al., 2010; Reguera et al., 2010) , implying that the L proteins of these viruses may also be N-terminally acetylated by NatB and that their endonuclease activity may be regulated by the NatB. Further analysis is required to determine the importance of N-terminal acetylation by NatB and other NATs in the polymerase and shutoff activities of viruses other than influenza virus.",

In some cases, a plasmid encoding NAA20, NAA25, or GFP was co-transfected to restore expression of NAA20 or NAA25. The transfected cells in three of the wells were analyzed for firefly luciferase activity by using the Bright-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) at 24 hr post-transfection. The shutoff activity of PA-X was calculated by dividing the luminescence value of firefly luciferase co-transfected with an empty plasmid by that co-transfected with PA-X-expressing plasmids. Data are shown as the average of the relative shutoff activity \u00b1 SD (n = 3). To analyze the expression of PA-X, NAA20, and NAA25, the transfected cells in the fourth well were lysed in 2 3 SDS sample buffer at 24 hr post-transfection. The cell lysates were sonicated, incubated for 10 min at 95 C and then loaded onto an Any KD Mini-PROTEAN TGX Gel (Bio-Rad).
