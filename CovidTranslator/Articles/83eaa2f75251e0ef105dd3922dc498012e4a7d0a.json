Consumers can now access online bookings for airlines, accommodation, transportation, sightseeing tours and other related products, so why do they still go to travel agencies for reservations? This article identifies the attributes consumers seek in a travel agency or consultant and determines the relative importance of these in their selection process. The research was conducted in two stages. The first stage was a series of in-depth interviews with 10 travel agency users and three travel consultants.",

Of particular note was that these attributes related to the consultant and not the agency per se. Travel reward programs were seen as the least influential in this research.",

Yet, travel agencies have been regarded as critical information and planning or booking providers for a large number of travellers (Buhalis, 1998; Buhalis & Deimezi, 2003; Duke & Persia, 1993; Mihalik, Uysal, & Pan, 1995) . Other studies have also investigated several different aspects of travel agencies, such as information technology needs (Bennett, 1993; Buhalis, 1998; Buhalis & Deimezi, 2003) , travel agent's role in family decision-making (Michie & Sullivan, 1990) , advertising strategies (Laskey, Seaton, & Nicholls, 1994) , the more effective use of relationship marketing (Bennett, 1993; Richter, 1996) and the selection attributes of travel agencies (Buhalis, 1998; Meidan, 1979; Persia & Gitelson, 1993; Oppermann, 1998) .

This attribute was important, particularly in the travel agency business, since it is a common belief that customers from a competitor can be won over if an attractive list of free 'extras' is offered (Persia & Gitelson, 1993) . Agency advertisement, knowledgeable and experienced travel consultants, and sufficient brochures were important to consumers where they could consider the use of such information, opinions and suggestions provided to evaluate alternatives prior to making the purchase (Bellur, McNamara, & Prokop, 1988; Buhalis, 1998; Gitelson & Crompton, 1983; Joint Travel Agent/Airline Economic and Value Study, 1978) . The increasing public media attention and unsettling world events (such as the London transport system, the Bali attack and the sudden SARS outbreak) contributed to major financial uncertainties for tour operators and travel agencies, which resulted in a need for consumers to evaluate the travel agency's reputation as part of their selection process (Persia & Gitelson, 1993) . The findings in several studies conducted (for example, Kendall & Booms, 1989; Meidan, 1979) revealed that the physical aspects of agency (i.e., agency layout and atmosphere, convenient location and trading hours/days) were regarded as a fundamental concern of travel agency users. The demand for holidays was considered to be 'price-elastic' and therefore the holiday/package price could possibly determine a consumer's choice of travel agency (Meidan, 1979) . Quality and variety of holiday/travel packages were recognised as one of the most important selling points in the travel agency business and consumers could be potentially looking for such attributes in selecting their choice of a travel agency (Meidan, 1979) . Finally, in the serviceoriented travel agency business, helpful and friendly staff could be central to the success of the transaction where integrating consumers' participation becomes part of the process of delivering the outcome (Meidan, 1979; Persia & Gitelson, 1993 ).",

Due to an apparent absence of research literature about travel agencies operating in regional settings and the consequent absence of empirically tested models, it was deemed necessary to develop propositions about the research issues. Therefore a two-stage process was adopted; first interviews with key stakeholders among travel agencies in the regional Australia were conducted in order to test the relevance of the current literature about consumer selection of travel agencies in regional settings, but also to identify other issues that may be specific to travel agencies in such settings. In the second stage, a mail-out survey using information gleaned from the first stage was conducted.",

This technique not only allows the interviewer to gather preliminary information about the research topic but, more specifically, to gain insights and understanding regarding the research objectives (Jones, 1985; Kumar, 1996) . Second, in-depth inter-views also provide the flexibility to allow the interviewer to modify, drop or add propositions in response to evidence from the interviewees, particularly in relation to factors that influence the selection of a travel agency (Jones, 1985; Minichiello et al., 1995) . Thus, the interviewer is able to acquire a more valuable outcome through the use of this technique.",

These respondents suggested that this attribute was not the key driving force in determining their choice of travel agency, but rather as an insignificant associated incentive. Table 3 briefly illustrates the relative importance of the various attributes used to select a travel agency in a regional context. Generally, respondents were consistent in their responses to the importance of the different attributes when selecting their travel agency. However, findings show that there were notable significant differences between some selection attributes as indicated in Table 3 , column 3. Furthermore, there were also notable differences between gender group (such as helpful and friendly staff, travel agency reputation and additional services), age group (such as quality of travel packages, travel agency reputation, additional services, convenient location, agency layout and atmosphere and parking), and household income group (such as holiday/package price, quality of travel packages, travel agency reputation and additional services). Tables 4, 5 and 6 briefly illustrate the differences in these respective groups. The variation can be explained by respondents' level of travel experiences as a whole and also their attitudes towards travel agencies.",

The survey results revealed that knowledgeable and experienced travel consultants were the most important factor in selecting a travel agency, while travel reward programs were seen as the least influential in the selection process. From the findings, it appeared that while the future of travel agencies may be contentious given the introduction of the internet technology, it seemed that the competitive advantage that travel agencies enjoy is the 'human' element (Buhalis, 1998) . Table 3 highlighted the relative importance of those influencing factors and provided consumers with a list of attributes which they could use in their selection of a travel agency. From this study, consumers are able to consider and question the relevance of these criteria and determine the essential factors that require consideration during their selection process.",

A more representative sampling population should be sought to generalise the findings and be tested in another Australian regional setting. The findings from this study could be further investigated in a business organisation context where comparisons to the findings could be made to determine if there are any significant differences between individual consumers and business organisations on the factors influencing the selection of travel agencies in regional settings. Furthermore, the attitude of customers who do not walk through the door (example via the internet) could also be explored, to determine if any differences existed between traditional 'walk in' customers and 'techno savvy' customers who generally make online bookings, when selecting travel agencies.",
