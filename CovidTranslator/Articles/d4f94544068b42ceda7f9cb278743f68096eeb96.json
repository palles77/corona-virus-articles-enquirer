LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE, 2nd edition Individual shipments of swine are best separated by time and distance and in particular, mixing animals from multiple vendors is poor practice. Swine should be purchased from vendor herds that are validated brucellosis-free and qualified pseudorabies-negative by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Commercial sources typically implement a vaccination and parasite-control program beginning at weaning age and dependent on the intended experimental use of the animal, such efforts may or may not need additional attention at the research facility. Quality source herds will worm piglets at 4-to 6-week intervals and administer preventive treatments for ectoparasites.",

Newly received animals should be given a minimum of 72 hr to adjust to the new environment during which time physical exams and screening tests for parasites can be performed. Diet changes should be gradual over several days, with fiber increased if stress-induced diarrhea develops. Adult swine that are housed long-term should have, at a minimum, periodic physical exams that include weight and parasite checks. Vaccination programs for adult swine should be implemented based on risk assessment that considers how the animal will be used in research, what the housing conditions are, and how close the research herd is to new animals of uncertain health status. Ideally, pigs should be purchased from one source of established health status to take advantage of natural herd immunity. The value of good herd health management is illustrated by the observation that swine herds that maintain specific pathogen-free status have an odds ratio of 0.2 relative to that of conventional herds for the development of diarrhea .",

Swine have difficulty with firm footing on these floors, especially when the floors are wet. If contact flooring is used, it should either have a rough surface to provide traction and provide wear on the hooves or it should be covered with deep wood-chip bedding. Wood-chip bedding keeps swine clean and satisfies their rooting instinct. However, wood-chip bedding is eaten by swine, especially when they are fasted. Raised flooring has been found to be satisfactory in many laboratory situations. Plastic-coated metal grids are sturdy and easy to sanitize. However, if a cut becomes apparent in the plastic, swine will strip the flooring and eat the plastic. Slatted fiberglass floors with grit to provide hoof wear are generally ideal in most situations. They are lightweight and easy to remove from pens for sanitation (Swindle, 1998) .",

Cardiovascular diseases of interest include atherosclerosis, coronary arterial stenosis and infarction, congenital heart disease, volume-and pressureoverload heart failure, electrophysiology, and testing of grafts, stents, and interventional devices. Swine are uniquely susceptible to atherosclerosis, which may be induced by feeding of cholesterol and fat-enhanced diets. A more rapid form of atherosclerosis may be induced by damaging the endothelium with a organs, the surgical anatomy, and response to immunosuppressive therapy make them ideal for many of these studies. Swine are being developed as models and donors for xenotransplantation, which has included the development of transgenic strains (Swindle, 1998a) . The anatomic and physiologic characteristics of the skin have made swine a definitive plastic surgical model. Swine have also been developed as models in a wide variety of other surgical procedures, including fetal surgery and procedures in the musculoskeletal, central nervous, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and cardiopulmonary systems. Many other biological models have been developed in swine, including the areas of systemic and dermal toxicology, septic and hemorrhagic shock, immunology, diabetes, malignant melanoma, malignant hyperthermia, and gastric ulceration.

There is considerable variation of the genetic capacity for accretion of lean body mass among the various breeds of swine utilized in biomedical research. The \"farm swine\" include breeds developed for meat production and at 6 months of age may have a lean body weight 5-to 6-fold greater than that of a micropig breed. The published research on swine nutrition is focused on farm swine and maximization of lean growth (Table III) . The majority of mini-and microswine nutritional research is proprietary and is reflected in the com-mercially available formulations offered by feed companies. In general, the nutrient requirements of these breeds are similar; however, the small breeds often require fixed-quantity feeding to control obesity, especially for long-term research studies. This in turn necessitates a higher margin of safety for many nutrient concentrations to prevent deficiencies, since most commercially available diets are designed for free-choice feeding. Diets formulated for the mini-and microbreeds generally have lower-energy and higher-fiber concentrations. The daily energy (Fig. 10 ) and quantity of feed (Fig. 11 ) required by farm pigs will predispose the mini-and microbreeds to obesity.",

Prior to the onset of estrus, sows will exhibit signs of vulvar reddening and swelling, mucous discharge, nervousness, and increased activity. During estrus, sows will stand immobile when pressure is applied to the rump (Braun, 1993) . Silent estrus is common in swine, but the presence of a boar can facilitate estrus detection (Dial et al., 1992) . Optimal fertilization rates occur when insemination takes place 12 hr prior to ovulation. However, the variability in the interval between onset of estrus and ovulation makes it difficult to determine when females ovulate. As a result, commercial producers usually breed sows twice during estrus to maximize conception rates. Litter size also tends to increase with multiple matings per estrus. In pen mating, the sow and boar are left together during estrus. Hand mating involves placing the sow and boar in the same pen at 12-24 hr intervals during estrus until the female is no longer receptive (Dial et al., 1992) . Swine may also be bred by artificial insemination; however, conception rates are typically 10-15% lower than when natural service is used. Satisfactory results are obtained if sows are inseminated 10-30 hr after the beginning of estrus (Einarsson, 1980) .",

They also help maintain the neonates' body temperature since newborn piglets lack the ability to effectively thermoregulate. Environmental temperature should be 85~176 with a supplemental heat source in the stall that results in a temperature of approximately 90~ at pig level (Fisher, 1993) . Hanging heat lamps are commonly used and should be positioned to be effective without causing burns.

Competition is normal among littermates during nursing and can result in inadequate colostrum and milk intake in less dominant animals. Neonates will compete for, and establish, teat order on their day of birth. This hierarchy remains until weaning (Sawatsky, 1993) . If necessary, the technique of split suckling can be used to ensure that all animals can nurse. This involves removing half of the litter comprising the largest piglets 3 -4 times a day to allow the smaller animals to nurse adequately (Reeves, 1993; Dial et al., 1992) .

Pigs have an innate need to root, which can become destructive if they are not provided with an adequate outlet for expression. Housing strategies should accommodate swine behavioral needs as much as possible within the constraints of experimental design. Group housing or housing 2 animals per cage can be used to allow social interactions among animals. If individual housing is necessary, cages should be close together, and their design should include openings at the bottom to facilitate contact. Providing bedding material such as wood shavings is an excellent way to satisfy pigs' rooting behavior. Bedding material has the additional advantage of absorbing excreta but can be more labor-intensive for the husbandry staff than slatted or mesh flooring. Alternatively, a variety of toys, such as balls, chains, or hoses, can be supplied to help provide cage enrichment (Sawatsky, 1993; Fisher, 1993) .",

Gentle handling and the use of a humane restraint sling is warranted whenever swine need to be transported from their home cages or when restraint is necessary during noninvasive procedures. Many pigs respond to gentle rubbing of the ventral abdomen by rolling over onto their sides, enabling caregivers to perform such minor procedures as wound cleansing or suture removal without restraining the animals.

Many homologous CD markers have now been identified, and a limited number are available commercially from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Virginia) and Pharmingen, Inc. (San Diego, California). A monoclonal antiporcine CD3 antibody has been identified that is capable of activating or depleting T cells in vitro and inducing an immunosuppressive state in vivo, which will greatly facilitate studies of the swine immune system, in particular, induction of tolerance in xenotransplantation research (Huang et al., 1999) . Bone marrow of swine is more similar to that of humans than of rodents in toxicity response to lethal irradiation, allowing studies that have demonstrated the benefit of T-cell de-pletion of donor tissues in preventing graft-versus-host disease. Normative data for the swine immune system, such as lymphoid tissue weights and percentages of cell subsets represented in different tissues, are influenced by the animal health status, as data derived from animals of conventional health status (i.e., farm environments) differ significantly from data derived from those housed under specific pathogen-flee, gnotobiotic, or axenic conditions. The pig has a large population of what were initially considered as \"null\" cells, lacking expression of CD2, CD4, or CD8, but now known to express CD3, classifying them as T cells. This lymphoid population is largely y5 T cells and is found in large numbers in various tissues, especially mucosal sites, as in ruminants . Expression of CD4 (T helper) and CD8 (T cytotoxic or T suppressor) is mutually exclusive in most species, but swine have a unique lymphocyte subset that expresses both CD4 and CD8 (Thome et al., 1994) . (Adapted from computer model program, NRC, 1998, with permission.) This subset may represent a type of memory cell or a lineage that differentiates into CD4 \u00a7 -, since CD8 expression is low and the CD8 dimer, normally a13 in chain structure, is as in these cells.",

Located on chromosome 7, swine leukocyte antigens (SLA), the equivalent of the mouse major histocompatibilite complex (MHC), have been cloned and sequenced. As they are in other species, SLA class I genes are universal in tissue expression and function to restrict T-cell activation, particularly antiviral immune responses, and are pivotal for inducing tolerance for \"self.\" The SLA class II genes have been cloned and are restricted in expression to B cells, activated macrophages, a subset of CD8 \u00a7 T cells, and vascular endothelium. The number of SLA class III genes that have been cloned is lower than that found in other species. Member genes of the SLA class III complex function in the complement system, which in the pig is closely aligned with the human systems of classical and alternative pathways of complement activation.

Pairing donor and recipient within a line is used to model for transplants between identical human siblings, between lines as a model for nonidentical siblings, and between F1 hydrids for parentoffspring transplants. Intra-SLA recombinant strains have permitted study of SLA class I and II differences and demonstrated the effect of SLA mismatches on graft survival of various tissues. Matching SLA skin grafts typically survive for 7 to 12 days, but vascular grafts and liver transplants survive much longer, some indefinitely. One-third of renal transplants have survived indefinitely, and when rejection did occur, it led to discovery of non-SLA-linked genes that promoted immunemediated rejection. Acceptance of vascular grafts has been shown to induce tolerance to minor histocompatibility loci, and when performed prior to skin grafting, skin graft survival time was extended. Reversing this process (skin graft first) apparently sensitizes the host to reject vascular grafts hyperacutely.",

High titers of natural \"xenoantibodies\" in the human (or experimentally, in the nonhuman primate) target carbohydrate antigens, such as Gal(c~I-3),Gal(c~I-4),GlcNAc-R, expressed on donor tissue endothelium, resulting in complement activation and subsequent vascular injury and in severe cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). One strategy has been to eliminate natural xenoantibodies from the circulation of baboons using a-Gal immunoaffinity columns or extracorporeal perfusion through pig liver; depletion is temporary, on the order of days to weeks (Kozlowski et al., 1998) . Sachs unsuccessfully attempted to identify an inbred swine genotype of low a-Gal expression with the objective of using selective breeding of pigs to decrease a-Gal expression (Chae et al., 1999) . Others have suggested screening specific donors for carbohydrate antigen expression levels as a means to diminish antigenic stimulation of the recipient (Papalois et al., 1999) . Brenner et al.

An attractive approach that has shown early promise is the induction of donor-specific tolerance using bone marrow transplantation to create chimeras. Tolerance to fully MHC-mismatched allografts has been demonstrated in mice and primates after first creating a mixed allogeneic hematopoietic chimerism by engrafting donor bone marrow cells into the recipient. However, this hematopoietic chimerism has been difficult to achieve in the discordant pig-toprimate xenogeneic model (Sablinski et al., 1999) , most likely due to species-specific differences in regulatory cytokines and elements of the stromal microenvironment . Representative of a typical experimental protocol and illustrative of the complexities involved, recipient primates underwent whole-body irradiation on days 6 and 5 prior to infusion of pig bone marrow. Primate antipig xenoantibodies were immunoadsorbed by extracorporeal perfusion of recipient blood through a pig liver immediately before the intravenous infusion of porcine marrow (day 0). In addition to cyclosporine for 4 weeks and 15deoxyspergualin for 2 weeks, recombinant pig stem-cell factor and interleukin 3 were given for 2 weeks. Recipient primates required 4 weeks to recover from pancytopenia from whole body irradiation, and antipig IgM and IgG antibodies were temporarily depleted by the liver perfusion for 12 to 14 days. About 2% of the myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow of the recipient were of pig origin, and the chimeric animal was less responsive by mixed lymphocyte reaction to pig-specific stimulators. This was the first report of long-term survival of discordant xenogeneic bone marrow in a primate recipient. Others have re-ported on the poor function of porcine hematopoietic cells in primate marrow microenvironments. Warrens et al. (1998) found differences between swine and human bone marrow cultures in function of two well-characterized ligands known to be important in hematopoiesis, CD44 and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), but they concluded that the differences were not significant enough to explain lack of effective porcine hematopoiesis in the primate marrow, suggesting that other unknown interactions may be important.",

Transcription of the transgene was transient, and xenografts were rejected after 8 to 22 days. This experiment was important because it demonstrated that transfer and expression of xenogeneic class II transgenes can be achieved in baboons, and this therapy may prevent late T cell-dependent responses to porcine xenografts, which include induced non-a-Gal IgG antibody responses. Porcine thymic grafts in immunodeficient mice have been found to support normal development of polyclonal, functional human T cells, and these T cells were specifically tolerant to SLA antigens of the porcine thymus donor, suggesting thymic transplantation may be an approach to achieve tolerance in pig-to-human xenotransplantation (Nikolic et al., 1999) .",

The stress increases shedding by inapparent carriers. Salmonella choleraesuis is fairly host-specific for swine, but S. typhimurium is not host-specific (Schwartz, 1999) .

Affected pigs will tremble, hypersalivate, stumble, and exhibit nystagmus and opisthotonus, often with epileptiform-like seizures. Because of posterior paresis, the animals may be observed actually sitting like a dog. Other signs include circling and paddling, vomiting, and diarrhea. Once CNS signs start, death usually follows within 24-36 hr, and mortality approaches 100%. As the pigs age, the clinical signs become less severe, fewer pigs develop CNS involvement, and mortality declines. Respiratory signs characterized by sneezing, nasal discharge, and cough become the hallmark of pigs that are infected at greater than 9 weeks of age. Morbidity rate is high, but mortality is low with uncomplicated CNS signs such as muscle tremors that occur only sporadically. The duration of clinical signs is usually 6-10 days, with rapid recovery unless the disease has progressed to pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia has been initiated. Sows and boars also develop primarily respiratory signs, although pregnant animals in the second to third trimester abort and in the first trimester, resorb the fetus.",

Infective levels of virus can persist for up to 7 hr in air with relative humidity of 55% (Schoenbaum et al., 1990) . Infective levels of viral particles can also be present in tissues of animals that have died from the disease. Consuming infected carcasses or feed that has been contaminated with the virus is another means of transmission.

Animals that are vaccinated, however, do shed lesser amounts of virus and have a limited tissue invasion by the organism. The gene-deleted vaccinations offer the advantage of producing vaccinated animals that lack antibody against the specific protein coded for by the deleted gene. This allows the vaccinated pig to be differentiated serologically from an infected pig. Pseudorabies is a reportable disease, and in January 1989, a national pseudorabies virus-eradication program was implemented in the United States (Ormiston, 1988) .

Porcine cytomegalovirus (CMV), which is the cause of inclusion body rhinitis, does not cause nasal turbinate atrophy; however, it may damage the nasal mucosa, predisposing it to colonization with one of these bacterial agents. Environmental air pollutants, namely, high ammonia levels (50-100 ppm) and dust (Hamilton et al., 1999) , and genetic factors also play a role. Pasteurella multocida strains A and D produce a thermolabile dermonecrotic toxin (DNT), which severely damages the nasal mucosa, producing a progressive form of nasal turbinate atrophy. Bordetella bronchiseptica also produces a heat-labile DNT and alone will produce a moderate self-limiting form of the disease in which damaged tissues may regenerate in time (Tibor, 1999) . Haemophilus parasuis reportedly causes a mild turbinate atrophy (Cowart, 1995) . Combined infections of toxigenic P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica produce the most severe form. Typically, two or more infectious organisms are required to produce clin-ical disease with permanent nasal distortion and turbinate atrophy. Recently, the term \"nonprogressive atrophic rhinitis\" (NPAR) has been applied to the form caused by B. bronchiseptica alone, and the term \"progressive atrophic rhinitis\" (PAR) to P. multocida alone and combined infections of P. multocida and B. bronchiseptica (De Jong, 1999) .",

The signs are a mild fever (103~176 or 39.5~176 marked \"whooping\" cough, and dyspnea, with high morbidity and mortality possible if untreated. This organism is frequently isolated from pneumonic lesions of older pigs; however, its role as a pathogen in this situation is questionable (De Jong, 1999) .

In some cases epistaxis is seen. Inflammation of the nasolacrimal duct, which causes occlusion of the duct and subsequent tear staining visible at the medial canthus, frequently occurs. The most characteristic clinical sign is the dorsal and/or lateral deviation of the snout as the pig grows. This is caused by the abnormal bone growth, which occurs as a result of unequal nasal turbinate atrophy. Brachygnathia superior (BS) is the most common form seen and is due to slower bone growth in the upper jaw which gives it an upturned appearance. Significant turbinate atrophy can be present without visible snout abnormalities. Commonly, this atrophy is subjectively measured at necropsy by visual scoring of a section at the level of the second premolar. Techniques for objective quantification of this atrophy by digital image analysis or digitization (Gatlin et al., 1996) and computed tomography (Shryock et al., 1998) have been published. The latter method allows morphometric analysis of live pigs. In the more severe cases, whole-body growth rate will be decreased (De Jong, 1999) , and this may be due in part to the possibility that the toxin produced affects the growth of the skeletal system (Ackermann et al., 1996) . Differentials for PAR include other causes of facial deformities, including paranasal abscesses and breed variations.",

Piglets infected in the first week of life will generally develop more severe lesions than those infected at 4 weeks or later. Those infected at 9 weeks show almost no lesions (De Jong, 1999) . The quantity and quality of passive antibody obtained from the sow also affects the severity of lesions. In SPF herds the mode of transmission is often the introduction of new carrier animals to the herd.

Development and maintenance of an SPF swine facility using cesarian section, medicated early weaning, and segregated early weaning are the most satisfactory methods of prevention. The focus should be on assuring freedom from toxigenic P. multocida since this is the most pathogenic etiologic agent of this multifactorial disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays directed at the gene that encodes for the dermonecrotic toxin produced by toxigenic strains of P. multocida are reportedly specific and sensitive when used on nasal and tonsillar swabs (Kamp et al., 1996; Lichtensteiger et al., 1996) and colostrum (Levonen et al., 1996) . Assays of this type and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) may be used for herd-health monitoring, facility biosecurity, and clinical diagnosis.",

Primary isolation may be achieved by cross-streaking on a blood agar plate with a staphylococcus, which produces NAD.

This organism also shows the Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen (CAMP) phenomenon or reaction when colonies are grown near a [3 toxigenic Staphylococcus aureus.

Histopathologic lesions are a necrotizing, fibrinous, and hemorrhagic pneumonia that is predominantly lymphocytic and histiocytic, as well as a vasculitis with thrombosis of vessels and lymphatics (Didier et al., 1984; Nielsen, 1973) .",

An ELISA utilizing the A. pleuropneumoniae ApxlI antigen has been shown to be useful for this purpose (Leiner et al., 1999) . In addition, PCR on mixed bacterial cultures from swine tonsils may be more sensitive than culture for detection (Gram et al., 1996) . Vaccination of seronegative animals prior to introduction and maintaining optimal ambient temperature, ventilation, and humidity are useful for minimizing clinical disease in infected herds (Taylor, 1999) . Segregated early-weaning practices can potentially eliminate APP; however, this is difficult because this bacterium is an early colonizer (Maclnnes and Desrosiers, 1999) .

Oral chlortetracycline (CTC) has been found to offer better protection from clinical disease than oxytetracycline (OTC) in experimental APP serotype 1 clinical challenge.

The agent is distributed worldwide, and antibodies to the virus are found in about 45% of the sampled pig populations. The influenza A viruses belong to the family of RNA viruses, Orthomyxoviridae. The type A viruses are further classified based on the glycoprotein spikes that extend from the viral particle (hemagglutinin [H] and neuraminidase [N]). The antigenic characteristics of these spikes provided the basis for dividing these viruses into subtypes. Antigenic comparison of the H1N1 swine viruses has shown, in contrast to human strains, that there has been little antigenic variation over the last 50 years (Sherrar et aL, 1989) . This could be attributed to the fact that the virus is able to propagate in an ever-present population of nonimmune pigs. Strain H3N2 is also very prevalent in swine.",

The ETEC organisms contain a mucopolysaccharide capsule that is antiphagocytic and not very antigenic. The K1 polysaccharide enhances bacterial resistance to complement mediated killing by inhibiting the alternative pathway to complement activation. The very long O chain polysaccharide chains in the cell wall bind the membrane attack complex resuiting from complement activation distant from the cell membrane so that it cannot lyse the cell (Gyles and Thoen, 1993) . Specialized fimbriae, K88(F4), K99(F5), F6, and F41, permit the adherence and colonization of the enterocytes. The ETEC also produce heat-labile toxins, which elevate levels of adenylate cyclase leading to the efflux of Na and C1 ions and water out of the cell. In addition, SLT-IIe, a heat-labile, Shiga-like toxin, binds to and damages vascular endothelium, resulting in edema, hemorrhage, and thrombosis (Gyles and Thoen, 1993) .

They are stable in the environment and are relatively resistant to effects of temperature, pH, and disinfectants. Clinical signs and differential diagnoses. Disease is most severe in naive pigs first exposed at 1 to 5 days of age. Typical signs include anorexia, lethargy, some vomiting, and profuse watery diarrhea that is white to yellow in color and contains flocculent material. In pigs that will recover, consistency of feces slowly returns to normal after 3 to 5 days of diarrhea. Death loss due to dehydration can reach 50-100% of affected piglets. Clinical signs and losses are less severe if exposure occurs after piglets are 7 days of age, and infection is commonly subclinical if it occurs after they are 21 to 28 days of age. Disease is usually mild and self-limiting if other enteric pathogens are absent. If rotaviral infection is detected in clinically ill pigs of postweaning age, mixed infection with other agents such as TGEV should be suspected.

Clinical signs. Acute infection of both postnatal and pregnant dams is subclinical; however, the pigs will have a transient, mild leukopenia within 10 days after the initial exposure. The only clinical sequela to exposure is maternal reproductive failure. Dams can cycle back into estrus, farrow fewer pigs per litter, or farrow a large proportion of mummified fetuses. Typically, an epizootic of PPV starts as a subclinical infection and culminates with the delivery of mummified fetuses, usually at or near term. Most of the infected fetuses have a crown-rump length of 17 cm or less because those infected after day 70 are able to respond to the viral assault and survive (Mengeling et al., 1993) . Infertility, abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, prolonged gestations, and reduced neonatal viability have also been attributed to PPV.",

The agent is considered to be a \"slow spreader.\" The virus can be identified in semen prior to seroconversion as well as after cessation of viremia, indicating that virus isolation from serum and serology may not be an adequate indicator of infection status in boars.

Additional treatment includes sodium bicarbonate to combat the metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia. Active cooling of the animal may be done by ice packing and IV administration of cooled fluids, or by gastric and/or rectal lavage with iced saline. Dantrolene, an agent that prevents PSS by decreasing release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum while allowing calcium uptake to continue, is highly effective in stopping the progression of the syndrome when administered at the onset of signs. After the crisis is alleviated, the animal must be monitored closely for 48 hr; redevelopment of the syndrome in response to minor stressors can occur. Dantrolene can also be given as preventive therapy in animals known to be susceptible.",

This condition has been diagnosed with increasing frequency since the 1950s, with the distribution being worldwide and varied in occurrence. To date, the pathogenesis of the disease remains speculative. Clinical signs and differential diagnoses. The clinical signs vary depending on duration of the ulceration. In the peracute form, apparently healthy animals are simply found dead. In the acute form, pigs will become pale and weak, with an increased respiratory rate. Vomiting of blood and passage of bloody, tarry feces are seen. In the subacute or chronic form, the animal will be anemic and anorexic, with passage of dark feces that may be intermittent or persistent. Occasionally, the only sign observed may be the passage of dark, hard feces. Pigs of either sex and any breed may be affected. Usually, single pigs are affected, and body temperature is normal or slightly subnormal. Anemia can be detected hematologically if the chronic/subacute form is present. Differential diagnoses include swine dysentery, Salmonella choleraesuis, transmissible gastroenteritis, and intestinal hemorrhagic syndrome. These diseases can be differentiated relatively easily, as they impact on groupings of animals and result in high body temperatures, except in the hemorrhagic syndrome.",

The basis for this behavior probably stems from the natural tendency of pigs to root and chew to obtain food in their natural environment. In confined group housing, pen mates, for lack of anything better, take the place of natural rooting structures. Iron deficiency anemia has been considered a possible cause for this behavior in piglets. Inadequate ambient temperature control, ventilation, pen and feeder space, and access to water (Rizvi et al., 1998) are also considered contributing factors. However, the most plausible explanation is the lack of sufficient environmental enrichment. Corrective measures should include access to rooting materials, including wood-chip bedding, straw, and \"indestructible\" polyethylene balls. When groups are formed, the animals should be of similar age and size and of numbers appropriate for the space. Tail docking is also considered a preventive measure since this reduces the incidence of tail biting (Hemsworth, 1999) .",
