Two unrelated batches of CAV16 samples were purified using (a) 15 to 45% (w/v) and (b) 10 to 40% (w/v) sucrose density gradients at 103614g for 3.5 h and 3 h, respectively. (a) Two states of CAV16 particle were separated from the first sample, one band is located one third from the top of the tube containing ~25% sucrose, the other ~29% sucrose. The absorbance ratio (\u03bb260/\u03bb280) is 0.85 for the top band that corresponds to empty particles containing no RNA , and 1.66 for the bottom band that corresponds to particles containing RNA .

            "text": "sucrose. The absorbance ratios indicate that the top two bands (260/280=0.63; 0.64) are composed of empty particles and the lower band (260/280=1.67) full particles. 3 Supplementary Figure S2 Analytical ultracentrifugation. The sedimentation coefficients for the particles from the two batches of CAV16 samples were determined independently, (a) for the sample shown in Supplementary Figure S1a, using a virus concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 0.2M PBS buffer in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge in which the temperature of the rotor was regulated at 4 \u00b0C to maintain the integrity of the samples. Velocity experiments were performed at 29068g, collecting sample distribution profiles every 5 minutes using absorbance optics with incident light of 300 nm and also using interference optics. The data were analyzed using the program SedFit 40,41 in c(s) mode to give an apparent distribution of sedimentation coefficients; the 5th to 40th scan were used in each case for the c(s) calculation. The plots of the apparent c(s) distribution for a series of absorbance scans have two major peaks with sedimentation coefficients s(T,b), where T is 4 \u00b0C and b 0.2 M PBS, of 55S and 75S, equivalent to 85S and 120S at 20 \u00b0C, respectively 42 . We will thereafter refer to the former as empty and the later as 135S-like particles solely to reflect their structural features (see main text). (b) The same procedure was carried out at 20 \u00b0C for the sample shown in Supplementary Figure S1b, and produced two major peaks with sedimentation coefficients of 85S for the top two bands and 156S for the lower band, and these will be referred to as empty and 160S particles. 4 Supplementary Figure S3 Protein compositional analysis of the 3 states of CAV16 particles by NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen). Lane 1 shows markers (molecular weights provided for reference), lane 2 160S particles, lane 3 empty particles and lane 4 135S-like particles. The 160S particles have all 4 capsid proteins, the natural empty particles contain VP0, VP1 and VP3 while the 135S-like particles contain VP1, VP2 and VP3, but no VP4. Note the evidence of higher molecular weight 'ladders' consistent with some proteins being crosslinked during the formaldehyde inactivation process. 5 Supplementary Figure S4 PaSTRy assay. To characterize the stability of the three types of CAV16 particles, differential scanning fluorimetry assays were performed with dyes SYTO9 (to detect RNA exposure) and SYPROred (to follow protein melting) 25 . (a) The raw fluorescence traces of CAV16 160S, 135S-like as well as the empty particles from the two top bands in Supplementary Figure S1b incubated with SYTO9 are shown as blue, grey, red and green lines, respectively, confirming that the empty particles contain no detectable RNA, while 160S and 135S-like particles do contain RNA. The higher SYTO9 fluorescence signal at low temperature for the 135S-like particles implies that these particles are porous to the dye at low temperature whereas RNA in the 160S particles only becomes accessible at ~58 \u00baC. (b) The raw fluorescence traces of SYPROred. The higher fluorescence signal at low temperature for 135S-like particles (grey line) suggests that some hydrophobic regions of the capsid are solvent exposed. The proteins of empty particles (red and green lines) have higher themostability, which is in agreement with that of EV71 empty particles 14 . 6 Supplementary Figure S5. Comparison of the structure of the CAV16 135S-like and EV71 80S-like protomeric units 14 in cartoon depiction. VP1, VP2, VP3 and the VP1 N terminus of CAV16 are coloured in blue, green, red and magenta respectively, EV71 in grey. 7 Supplementary Figure S6.
