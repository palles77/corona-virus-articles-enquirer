The aim of the present study was to evaluate the validity of a commercially available automated human SAA turbidimetric immunoassay (SAA-TIA) in detecting and measuring SAA concentrations in cats, by means of assessing imprecision, inaccuracy, detection limit and overlap performance.",

Linearity during dilution using physiological saline was determined to indirectly estimate inaccuracy by duplicate within-run measurements on continuous dilutions (0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100%) of the high SAA concentration serum pool (Jensen, 2000) .

This variation between studies is most likely due to the use of different methodologies and the lack of available material for standardization of feline SAA assays. Detection limit was estimated as 0.38 mg/L, which was within the observed physiological range of SAA concentration of healthy cats. This should not impair clinical application, as the primary purpose of SAA measurements would be to identify ( Horizontal lines indicate median SAA concentration of the individual groups except those with neoplasia. This is in accordance with previous reports of the overlap performance of feline SAA (Kajikawa et al., 1999; Sasaki et al., 2003) . Furthermore, the differences appeared to be of a magnitude that would make the observed imprecision and detection limit acceptable for clinical use. The cut-off value for AGP used to differentiate between cats with and without an acutephase response was established independently of the present study (upper 95% confidence limit (Solberg, 1996) of the AGP levels in healthy cats; data including 51 healthy cats in which the AGP serum concentration was measured using the same method as in the present study (Selting et al., 2000) ). The previously reported kinetic differences between SAA and AGP (Kajikawa et al., 1999) could cause minor uncertainties regarding the parallel presence of both proteins during an acute-phase response, but the effect was considered to be negligible in the present study. This assumption was sustained by the observed significant correlation of the two acute-phase proteins.",

Thus, the assay demonstrated an overlap performance expected for feline SAA. Variation due to the freezing and storage of samples in the present study should be negligible as SAA has been reported to be stable at \u221220 \u2022 C (McDonald et al., 1991) and AGP is reported to be unaffected by freezing (Ganz et al., 1983) . Previous reports are available on species-specific determination of feline SAA (DiBartola et al., 1989; Sasaki et al., 2003) and on heterologous determination by means of rabbit anti-canine SAA-antibodybased ELISA (Kajikawa et al., 1996 (Kajikawa et al., , 1999 and anti-human SAA-antibody-based ELISA (Giordano et al., 2004) . However, none of these assays seem to be sufficiently practicable for routine application in terms of availability and automation. To the authors' knowledge there are no previous reports that demonstrate sufficient reliability of an SAA-TIA based on anti-human SAA antibodies for heterologous determination of feline SAA concentration. Analogously to their use in human medicine, feline SAA measurements are suggested to be applicable for diagnostic and monitoring purposes (Kajikawa et al., 1999; Sasaki et al., 2003) . The availability of a fast, reliable, readily available and automated assay such as the SAA-TIA should facilitate measurements of feline SAA in diagnostic laboratories and thus routine applicability in feline medicine.",

Investigation of overlap performance indicated (A) that the SAA concentrations (median [range]) of the cats with (21.3 mg/L [0.3-150.6 mg/L]) and without (0.4 mg/L [0.0-60.4 mg/L]) an acute-phase response, respectively (Figure 1), were significantly different ( p < 0.0001) and (B) that the median SAA concentrations of the various clinical groups also differed significantly ( p < 0.0001; 0.4 mg/L [0.0-3.9 mg/L], 46.6 mg/L [1.2-150.6 mg/L], 0.5 mg/L [0.3-11.6 mg/L], 1.5 mg/L [0.2-60.4 mg/L], 0.5 mg/L [0.2-21.3 mg/L] for clinically healthy cats, cats diagnosed with inflammatory/ infectious diseases, endocrine/metabolic diseases, neoplastic diseases, and miscellaneous disorders, respectively). Further comparison of the SAA concentrations in the individual groups (Figure 2) revealed that the serum SAA concentration in the group of cats with inflammation/infection was significantly higher than that of the cats belonging to the groups of clinically healthy cats ( p < 0.001), cats with endocrine disorders ( p < 0.01) and cats with miscellaneous disorders ( p < 0.001). No other pair of groups differed significantly in SAA concentration.DISCUSSIONThe TIA measured feline SAA with acceptable imprecision and the investigation of linearity during dilution revealed no sign of significant inaccuracy. The observed level of SAA in clinically healthy cats (range [median] 0.0-3.9 [0.4] mg/L) was comparable to that reported bySasaki and colleagues (2003)  (0.6 \u00b1 1.1 mg/L) but slightly lower than observations of others (20.5\u00b18.1 mg/L(DiBartola et al., 1989), 16.6\u00b111.4 mg/L",
