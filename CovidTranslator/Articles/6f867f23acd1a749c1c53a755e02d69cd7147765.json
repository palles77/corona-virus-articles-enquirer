            "text": "Studies of the incidence of pertussis in adults have shown that it accounts for only 5-15% cases of prolonged coughing. We assessed the burden of suffering related to prolonged coughing and tried to identify further causative agents. Based on a sentinel study with 35 general practitioners in two German cities (Krefeld, Rostock), with 3,946 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, we estimated the incidence of prolonged coughing in adults. In 975 of these outpatients, PCR and/or serology for adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus A and rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumonia, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were performed. Treatment data were extracted for a subgroup of 138 patients. Descriptive statistics, including Kaplan-Maier curves were generated. Yearly incidence ranged between 1.4 and 2.1% per population in the two cities. Adult patients sought medical attention only after a median of 3 weeks of coughing. Irrespective of smoking and unrelated to the identified pathogens, the median duration of coughing was 6 weeks, with an interquartile range of 4-11 weeks. In 48.3% of patients, possible pathogens were identified, among which adenovirus (15.1%), RSV (7.5%), B. pertussis (5.6%), and influenza viruses (4.0%) were most often found. Symptoms were not indicative of a specific agent and a total of 64% of patients received antibiotics. Prolonged adult coughing requiring medical attention prompts substantial healthcare use. Apart from B. pertussis, a broad range of pathogens was associated with the symptoms. However, patients sought medical attention too late to guide efficacious therapeutic interventions using the diagnostic tests.",

Even in a vaccine trial of an acellular pertussis vaccine in adults with active surveillance of all coughing episodes lasting more than 1 week, only around 5% were caused by B. pertussis [3] . We therefore wondered, which other agents might be responsible for prolonged coughing in nonpertussis cases. We had the opportunity to address this question in a data set originally collected to generate estimates about the population incidence of adult pertussis in Germany [4] . In this dataset, the available biological samples allowed us to extend the diagnostic tests to various pathogens known to be related to acute respiratory infections (ARI) [5] .",

Thus, the burden of suffering is known for pertussis, but unclear for most prolonged coughing in adults, affecting about 1.4 and 2.1% of the adult population annually. The condition is cumbersome owing to a median duration of coughing of 6 weeks, and it is a substantial burden to the healthcare system. In about half of the patients, a possible pathogen could be identified by the tests used in this study. However, patients visited their physicians only after coughing for 3 weeks in median, thus limiting the clinical relevance of diagnostic findings for therapeutic interventions. The duration of coughing was equal for smokers and nonsmokers and the proportion of smokers in our sample (26.1%) was similar to the 24.5% reported in the 2013 microcensus [14] .",

A retrospective database analysis of drug prescriptions in influenza and influenza-like illnesses of much shorter duration of coughing in Germany [17] showed that in that cohort, around 50% of patients did not receive prescriptions.

In their sample, however, only 39% of patients had a healthcare visit. Another US study [19] showed that among adults with febrile or severe ARI, around 40% were positive for any virus, with influenza virus and rhinovirus the leading causes. The importance of rhinovirus was also stressed by a European study pointing to the role of re-infections with another rhinovirus type [20] . Linking a laboratory database with telehealth service data in the UK, Morbey et al. [21] showed that the greatest burden of ARI was associated with influenza and RSV, and that RSV patients most often complained about coughing.",

Unfortunately, our data gave no hint of the potential role of specific clinical symptoms for either agent.

In accordance with a study from the UK [22] , our cohort also showed a higher consultation rate for women among all age groups. To account for annual variability in the circulation of microorganisms, the study was performed over three winter seasons. However, there are some limitations. The sentinels consisted of GPs and internists who worked as GPs. Thus, we systematically missed few patients who primarily attended specialists such as pulmonologists, or ENT specialists. The age distribution differed between HRO and KR, and patients in HRO were younger than those in KR, and we could not identify any cause of this. We used nasopharyngeal swabs for B. pertussis PCR, and pharyngeal washings for viral PCRs. Nasopharyngeal swabs are recommended for pertussis, but pharyngeal washing represents a non-optimal material for viral PCRs [23] . As the patients were coughing for a median of 3 weeks before visiting their physician, the overall sensitivity of PCR testing was reduced, as viral shedding, i.e., for rhinovirus or RSV [20, 24, 25] is mostly shorter. For serology, we only collected an acute serum sample, and could not show titer increases, which would have improved the specificity. Diagnostic serology is relevant for pertussis and mycoplasma infections [13, 26] , and in 9 patients with IgM antibodies to M. pneumoniae, we assumed a polyclonal response to multiple other antigens. Although viral serology is sometimes regarded as obsolete, we have recently shown that applying latent class analysis for validating diagnostic methods in the absence of a Bgold standard,^single-sample viral serology may identify additional cases [27] .",

In respect to influenza, the season 2001/2002 was described as moderate, the 2002/2003 season was strong, and the 2003/2004 season was again moderate [28] . Pertussis occurs in 3-to 4-yearly epidemic waves, and notified cases of pertussis in former East Germany [29] indicated that the study was carried out during an interepidemic period. Therefore, it is possible that the proportion of cases with influenza or pertussis might be higher in other time periods. A more timely publication of our results would have been warranted; unfortunately, the data and analyses could only be generated with substantial delay. However, there is no reason to assume that this invalidates our findings.",
