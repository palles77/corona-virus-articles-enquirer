By 10:30 on Mar 19, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases had reached 218,785 globally, including 8,949 deaths. Of the total confirmed COVID-19 patients, about 19.9% were severe cases [1] , which have a mortality rate of about 20%. Severe cases often suffer from underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes that can accelerate the progression of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection [2, 3] . Furthermore, acute respiratory distress syndrome could lead to death in some severe COVID-19 patients, and this is often accompanied by heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure [2, 4] . Therefore, early, simple and effective diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia is of great significance in reducing mortality and shortening the hospitalization period.",

It has been demonstrated that serum urea, CREA and CysC could be potential biomarkers that could rapidly and specifically reflect severe COVID-19, and it is of great significance in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 to reduce the mortality and shorten the hospitalization period for patients with severe COVID-19.

We also found that serum urea, CREA, and CysC, which are biochemical markers of renal function, were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection could damage the kidney, and this is consistent with part of the latest findings [9] . Furthermore, there were no differences in the serum HCO 3- results between severe and mild COVID-19 patients, and this further suggests that the glomerulus could be one of the target organs for the coronavirus in severe patients and may be related to the high expression of ACE2 in glomerular cells [10, 11] .",

The analysis included 4,166 test results from 28 COVID-19 patients, including 8 confirmed cases of severe COVID-19 (with a mean age of 66\u00b122 years) and 20 confirmed cases of mild COVID-19 (with a mean age of 41\u00b119 years), and the remaining baseline characteristics are shown in the Table 1. The serum biochemical analysis data, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), cholinesterase (CHE), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), creatine kinase (CK), creatine phosphokinase-isoenzyme-MB (CKMB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), CysC, CREA, urea, uric acid (UA), bicarbonate (HCO 3-) and C-reaction protein (CRP), were collected from COVID-19 patients when routine blood screening tests were performed. The above biomarkers were all determined by detection kits (Beckman Coulter, Suzhou, China) on a Beckman Coulter AU5821 biochemical analyser (Tokyo, Japan). Low-and high-value human serum matrix standards from Bio-Rad (California, USA) were used as quality controls in the biomarker tests, and all biochemical indexes were approved by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL) external 4 All rights reserved.
