            "text": "Type I interferon Interferon transcription factor 7 Japanese encephalitis virus Antiviral response A B S T R A C T Karyopherin \u03b14 (KPNA4) is an adaptor molecule that mediates type I interferon (IFN) production by facilitating the nuclear translocation of IFN transcription factors. Here, we cloned the duck KPNA4 (duKPNA4) gene and analyzed its involvement in type I IFN expression as well as antiviral response against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The full-length duKPNA4 gene encoded a 520-amino acid protein that shared 97.3-98.7% sequence similarity with its orthologues in chickens, humans and mice. The duKPNA4 was extensively expressed in various duck tissues at the mRNA level. Analysis of the subcellular localization of duKPNA4 by immunofluorescence assays indicated that the duKPNA4 was primarily distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in primary duck embryonic fibroblasts (DEFs). However, it translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to poly(I:C) stimulation or JEV infection. The duKPNA4 interacted with duck IFN regulatory factor 7 and facilitated its nuclear translocation, thereby up-regulating the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in DEFs in the presence of poly(I:C) stimulation. Exogenous expression of duKPNA4 significantly elevated the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 induced by JEV infection and inhibited JEV replication in DEFs. These data demonstrate the importance of duKPNA4 in type I IFN signaling as well as the antiviral response against JEV replication.",

In mammals, human KPNA4, a specific adaptor molecule, mediates the nuclear import of interferon (IFN) transcriptional regulators, such as NF-\u03baB p50/p65 heterodimers and IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3, thereby regulating type I IFN-mediated immune responses (Canton et al., 2018; Shaw et al., 2005) . Recently, pig KPNA4 has been demonstrated to bind pig IRF3 and initiate IFN-\u03b2 production during porcine circovirus infection . However, the role of avian KPNA4, especially duck KPNA4 (duKPNA4), in type I IFN expression was unknown. The IRF3 gene is absent in ducks, and the functions of duck IRF7 (duIRF7) complement most of IRF3's functions in regulating type I IFN expression (Magor et al., 2013) . Therefore, we sought to explore whether duKPNA4 interacts with duIRF7 and induces type I Li, et al. Developmental and Comparative Immunology 104 (2020) 103535 expression. Domestic duck farming is a popular business in China. In addition, ducks, as an amplification host, are susceptible to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection (Xiao et al., 2018) . JEV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus of the flavivirus genus that is transmitted by mosquitoes and vertebrate-amplifying hosts including birds (Dhanda et al., 1977) . JEV infection causes stunted growth and death in ducklings (Xiao et al., 2018) . In addition, JEV NS5 protein interacts with human KPNA4 and inhibits the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB in human cells (Ye et al., 2017) . We therefore cloned the duKPNA4 gene and analyzed its role in type I IFN expression as well as the antiviral response against JEV in primary duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs).",

Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that duKPNA4 had 98.7%, 98.7%, 98.1% and 97.3.0% sequence similarity to the chicken, helmeted guineafowl, human and mouse KPNA4 sequences, respectively (Fig. 1A) , and showed a high degree of sequence similarity to orthologues in other species. Structurally, duKPNA4 contained three domains that were conserved in all orthologues of other species, including an N-terminal importin \u03b2-binding (IBB) domain, a series of armadillo (ARM) repeats and a conserved short acidic cluster (Fig. 1A) . The ARM repeats are essential for NLS-binding and are composed of eight regions (ARM1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8), which shared nearly 100% sequence identity with sequences from other species (Fig. 1A) . Phylogenetic analysis indicated that duKPNA4 clustered together with chicken and helmeted guineafowl KPNA4 in the bird group and was closest to chicken KPNA4 (Fig. 1B) .",

In mammalian cells, KPNA4 interacts with IRF3 and subsequently promotes its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thus triggering the expression of type I IFN . The IRF3 gene is absent in the duck genome; therefore duIRF7 substitutes for most of IRF3's functions in regulating type I IFN expression (Chen et al., 2018) . Given that duKPNA4 upregulated type I IFN expression, we investigated whether duKPNA4 might interact with duIRF7 and promote the translocation of duIRF7 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. DEFs were co-transfected with plasmids for expression of duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc, and their co-localization was determined by IFAs in the presence or absence of poly(I:C) stimulation. The expressed duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc mainly co-localized in the cytoplasm in the absence of poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 5A) . However, in response to poly(I:C) stimulation, both the expressed duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and co-localized in the nucleus (Fig. 5A) , thus suggesting a possible interaction between duKPNA4 and duIRF7. To confirm this interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation in DEFs co-transfected with plasmids for expression of duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc, by using anti-HA antibody for immunoprecipitation and anti-Myc antibody for detection of the immunoprecipitated proteins. The duKPNA4-HA co-immunoprecipitated with duIRF7-Myc (Fig. 5B) , thus revealing that duKPNA4 interacted with duIRF7 in DEFs. To further analyze whether duKPNA4 promoted the nuclear translocation of duIRF7, we extracted the nuclear fractions from DEFs co-transfected with plasmids for expression of duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc, in the presence of poly(I:C) stimulation, and performed western blotting analysis to detect the protein levels of duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc. The expression of duKPNA4-HA and duIRF7-Myc in the whole cell lysates (WCL) of DEFs was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 5C ). Analysis of changes in the protein levels of duIRF7-Myc in the nuclear fractions revealed that the nuclear accumulation of duIRF7-Myc increased, an effect correlated with the increased nuclear accumulation of duKPNA4-HA ( Fig. 5C and D) , thus indicating that duKPNA4 facilitated the nuclear translocation of duIRF7, thereby upregulating type I IFN expression.",

DEFs were infected with JEV at different MOI (0.5, 1 and 5), and total RNA was extracted from JEV-infected cells to detect the endogenous mRNA expression levels of duKPNA4. The qRT-PCR analysis indicated that JEV infection did not significantly affect the mRNA expression of endogenous duKPNA4 in DEFs (Fig. 6A) . However, the subcellular location of duKPNA4-HA shifted from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in DEFs in response to JEV infection (Fig. 6B) , similarly to the translocation induced by poly(I:C) stimulation (Fig. 3) . Analysis of type I IFN expression in JEV-infected DEFs with or without overexpression of duKPNA4-HA revealed that exogenous expression of duKPNA4-HA significantly elevated the mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 induced by JEV infection, as compared with the levels in JEV-infected DEFs without duKPNA4-HA expression (vector control) (Fig. 6C) .

Knockdown of human KPNA4 in MCF-7 cells significantly inhibits NF-\u03baB activity and impairs IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression, thus leading to immunological dysfunction (Zhu et al., 2015) , whereas up-regulation of KPNA4 enhances NF-\u03baB activation (Chen et al., 2016) . Porcine KPNA4 has been found to be involved in the IRF3mediated type I IFN signaling pathway during porcine circovirus type 2 infection . In ducks, the toll-like receptor signaling pathway and the retinoic-acid-inducible gene I signaling pathway largely resemble the human pathways (Evseev and Magor, 2019) and play essential roles in the regulation of type I IFN expression and host antiviral response (Yu and Levine, 2011) . Notably, IRF3, as a downstream molecule in the toll-like receptor signaling pathway and the retinoicacid-inducible gene I signaling pathway, is absent in ducks, and duIRF7 instead performs most functions of IRF3 in inducing type I IFN expression (Santhakumar et al., 2017) . In the current study, duKPNA4 interacted with duIRF7 and facilitated the nuclear translocation of duIRF7. Mechanistically, duKPNA4 promotes type I IFN expression, probably via the duIRF7-mediated type I IFN signaling pathway, in contrast to mammalian KPNA4.",

(A) Sequence alignment of duKPNA4 with its orthologues. The amino acid sequence of duKPNA4 is compared with those of chicken (NM_001007963.1), helmeted guineafowl (XM_021393958.1), human (NM_002268.5) and mouse (NM_008467.4) KPNA4. IBB, N-terminal importin \u03b2binding domain. ARM, armadillo repeats. (B) A phylogenetic tree of KPNA4 was constructed by neighbor-joining by using amino acid sequences aligned in MEGA; the scale bar is 0.02. The duKPNA4 cloned in this study is labeled with a red dot.
