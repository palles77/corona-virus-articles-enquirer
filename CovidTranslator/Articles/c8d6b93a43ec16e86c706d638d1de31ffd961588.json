Methods Using Danish medical databases, we included all patients with a first-time hospital diagnosis of ON during 1995-2012. Each ON case was matched with 10 randomly selected population control subjects from general population. For all participants, we obtained a complete hospital history of comorbidities included in the CharlsonComorbidity Index 5 years preceding the inclusion date. results 4107 ON cases and 41 063 controls were included. The incidence of ON increased from 3.9 in 1995 to 5.5 in 2012 per 100 000 inhabitants. Solid cancer was the most common comorbidity, associated with an adjusted OR (aOR) for ON of 2.0 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.2). For advanced metastatic cancer, leukaemia and lymphoma, aORs of ON were 3.4 (95% CI 2.5 to 4.5), 4.3 (95% CI 2.7 to 7.0) and 5.8 (95% CI 4.3 to 7.8), respectively. Among other chronic conditions, aORs were 3.5 (95% CI 3.0 to 4.1) for connective tissue diseases and 2.3 (95% CI 2.0 to 2.7) for chronic pulmonary diseases. aORs were also increased at 2.8 (95% CI 1.9 to 4.1) and 4.5 (95% CI 2.5 to 8.2) for mild and moderate-to-severe liver disease, respectively, and 4.2 (95% CI 3.4 to 5.2) for renal disease. Conclusion This large population-based study provides evidence for an increasing ON incidence in the general population and documents an association between several common comorbid conditions and risk of ON.",

These associations may be mediated by use of corticosteroids 8 or other immunosuppressive drugs, 33 or may be related to the specific disease activity itself. 34 There are few data in the literature regarding a positive association between chronic pulmonary disease and increased risk of ON, as documented in our study. Presence of asthma has been reported in 4.5% of patients with steroid-induced femoral ON 8 and 8.0% of those with humeral ON. 5 Cooper et al 2 , in a case-control study, found a crude OR of 1.7 for an association of asthma with ON. Another study found no dose-response relationship between chronic corticosteroid use and risk of hip ON development. 9 On the contrary, in severe acute respiratory syndrome, risk of ON appeared to be correlated with the maximal corticosteroid daily dose used. 10 Tobacco smoking is a strong risk factor for many chronic pulmonary diseases, and current smoking itself has been associated with a relative risk for ON of 3.9-4.7. 16 17 Hepatic diseases have previously been associated with a 5.0-fold increase for incident ON 16 35 in accordance with our findings. Alcohol overuse is a known ON risk factor. 16-18 35 Previous studies found an estimated relative risk for ON development of 3.2 for occasional alcohol drinking, 17 7.8-13.1 for regular drinkers 16 17 and 17.9 in current drinkers with intake of greater than 1000 mL of alcohol weekly. 16 However, other factors than alcohol intake may play a role for increased ON risk in liver diseases. 35 ON occurrence seems to be lower in patients who have an immediate increase of cytolysis liver enzymes under steroid therapy, than in those without this quick response. 36 Furthermore, alcohol-related ON seems to be more closely associated with alcoholic liver disease than with alcohol-related pancreatic disease. 37 Also, other pathologies associated with bone impairment, including thrombocytopenia, 8 anaemia 19 or malnutrition with calcium and vitamin D deficiencies 38 are frequently found in patients with cirrhosis.",

            "text": "Only few studies have investigated the association between renal disorders and ON. A nationwide study found nephrotic syndrome to be present in 6.3%, nephritis in 2.5% and previous renal transplantation in 3.6% of patients with ON treated with corticosteroids. 8 ON occurrence in patients with renal pathology was at least partially attributed to corticosteroid use in other Open Access studies 13 20 but also to the underlying disease. 34 In patients with renal transplantation, any ON lesions tend to occur rapidly after surgery; renal homeostasis alteration as expressed by urea nitrogen levels 39 or metabolic changes, like high calcium and low phosphorus levels, seems to increase the risk of ON development. 40 Finally, our findings of an association between HIV infection and ON confirm results found in previous studies. 41 42 Our study has some limitations. The hospital diagnosis codes do not capture in detail the severity of the chronic diseases nor their medical therapy. Still, this limitation is present both in cases and controls with sparse effect on our relative risk estimates. Also, ICD-10 codes do not properly capture the type and location of ON. In a recent report, of 83 jaw ON cases confirmed in medical records during a period of 5 years, only two cases were coded using M87.1 and 8 cases were coded using M87.8, while other ICD-10 codes than those used in our report were used for the rest of the cases (K04.6, K10.2 or K10.3). 30 Thus, our comorbidity results likely cannot be generalised to jaw ON, which has rather different risk factors and prognosis than other ON cases. Also, we lacked information on potential important confounders such as lifestyle factors including smoking and alcohol consumption, and prescription medication including corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs, which may lead to residual confounding and an overestimation of the risk conferred by comorbidities. Nonetheless, we were able to mutually adjust for several comorbid conditions as surrogate measures, for example, chronic pulmonary diseases, lung cancer or peripheral vascular disease as markers of smoking, and connective tissue diseases, pulmonary diseases or haematological cancers as markers of corticosteroid use.",

In order to control for confounding, we could match ON cases and controls by sex, age, ethnicity and geographical region. Control subjects were randomly selected from the Central Population Registry among the study base giving rise to ON cases, diminishing risk of selection bias. There is no recall bias in our case-control study because the data on comorbidity are based on information already prospectively collected, independently of our study goals. The comorbidities analysed were coded prior the index date and are thus unlikely to be ON sequels.",
