Immunopathol., More than 2000 cats sent for necropsy in order to provide a diagnosis were investigated immunohistologically using paraffin sections for the presence of a persistent infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). The spectrum of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases associated significantly with FeLV infection was determined statistically. Three-quarters of the cats with persistent FeLV infections died of non-neoplastic diseases and about 23% died of tumors, nearly exclusively those of the leukemia/lymphoma disease complex. A strong association with liver degeneration, icterus and a FeLV-associated enteritis was found in addition to the known association with non-neoplastic diseases and conditions such as anemia, bacterial secondary infections and respiratory tract inflammations due to the immunosuppressive effect of FeLV, hemorrhages and feline infectious peritonitis. Surprisingly, diseases and conditions like feline infectious panleukopenia, enteritis (of other types than FeLV-associated enteritis and feline infectious panleukopenia), glomerulonephritis, uremia and hemorrhagic cystitis were not associated with persistent FeLV infection. Another unexpected finding was that most pathogenic infectious agents demonstrated in the cats were not FeLV-associated either. Thus, immunosuppression due to FeLV infection seems to make the animals susceptible to certain pathogenic infectious agents, but not to the majority.",

However, there has been comparatively little study of how often FeLV induces which disease, and how stringent is the association between a given disease and spontaneous FeLV infection. We therefore studied the frequency of FeLV infection in a large population of cats sent for post-mortem examination and determined the association of diseases and conditions of these cats with FeLV infection.",

Neither deterioration of the corpses nor time span between death and post-mortem examination seem to be of importance for the outcome of the test, at least not within the normal range for these factors in our material, where post-mortem examination usually takes place 1 to 5 days after death. The results of immunohistological investigation after death and demonstration of FeLV infection in blood smears in vivo are identical. In one case, FeLV infection was detected immunohistologically even 20 days after death in a cat in the state of advanced putrefaction and autolysis. Freezing of corpses also does not alter the outcome of the test. Immunohistological investigation of bone marrow and spleen are sufficient to detect persistent FeLV infection in more than 99.9% of the FeLVinfected cats.",

This difference in the frequency of FeLV infection in the two populations is highly significant and stresses the pathogenic importance of FeLV infection in cats. The figure of 16% FeLV infection indicates that FeLV is the most frequent cause of a lethal infectious disease in cats. It occurred twice as often as feline infectious panleukopenia and was even more abundant than feline infectious peritonitis which was present in about 14% of the cats sent to our department for necropsy. Only about 20% of the persistent FeLV infections diagnosed in our series of animals have been diagnosed in vivo by practitioners or clinicians.

However, 19% FeLV infection in cats with FIP is not significantly above the percentage of FeLV infection in our total necropsy cat population which is 16%. Thus, the stringency of the association between FeLV and FIP is not above the average of all diseases associated with FeLV.

No parvovirus infection could be shown in these animals by virological methods. Intestinal alterations of cats suffering from FeLV-associated enteritis resemble histologically those of feline infectious panleukopenia since crypt epithelium degeneration, crypt dilatation, vanishing of crypts and villous atrophy are also present. In bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, however, the typical lesions of feline infectious panleukopenia are absent. In contrast, these tissues are unaltered or even hyperplastic with blast proliferation. Of all cats with this type of enteritis, 72 % were infected with FeLV. The animals with FeLV-associated enteritis show immunohistologically FeLV protein synthesis in the crypt epithelium of the small intestine. Since FeLV, however, is not cytopathogenic by itself, there might be a second pathogenic mechanism associated with this disease. First immunohistological data indicate that the percentage of intestinal corona virus infection in cats with FeLV-associated enteritis is higher than in cats with other types of enteritis.",

No significant association was found for pseudorabies virus, feline parvovirus, feline herpesvirus 1 and feline calicivirus. The lack of significance in the association of feline herpesvirus 1 and feline calicivirus is astonishing since, as already mentioned, feline coryza (feline upper respiratory tract disease) and rhinitis were significantly FeL\u00a5 associated. Seemingly, FeL\u00a5 infection alone may lead to coryza or rhinitis, or agents other than feline herpesvirus 1 or calicivirus (not tested for in our studies) may be responsible for most of the nasal and upper respiratory tract conditions as a result of immunosuppression from FeLV infection.",

However, this holds true, at least in our study, only for the diseases of the leukemia/lymphoma complex. This group of diseases is the only one in which FeLV-positive cats (mean age 137 weeks) were significantly younger than FeLV-negative animals (mean age 263 weeks). All cats, however, which died of non-neoplastic diseases and suffered from FeLV viremia were significantly older when they were FeLV infected than FeLVnegative cats with the same diagnosis, provided a statistically significant difference in age between FeLV-positive and FeLV-negative cats could be shown at all. This holds true for cats with anemia (mean age of FeLV-positive cats 136 weeks, of FeLV-negative cats 105 weeks), emaciation (mean age of FeLVpositive cats 162 weeks, of FeLV-negative cats 95 weeks), icterus (mean age of FeLV-positive cats 286 weeks, of FeLV-negative cats 187 weeks) and FIP (mean age of FeLV-positive cats 177 weeks, of FeL\u00a5-negative cats 94 weeks).

On the other hand, liver degenerations like liver cell dissociation, fatty liver, focal liver necrosis and icterus, which have not been recognized to have any connection with FeLV infection until the present study was done, are significantly FeLV-associated and occur often in FeLVpositive cats.
