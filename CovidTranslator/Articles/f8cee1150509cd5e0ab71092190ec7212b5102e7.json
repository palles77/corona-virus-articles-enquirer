Often, these congenital anomalies are first diagnosed during the initial clinical examination before vaccination or as the result of obviously limited exercise tolerance or failure to grow. Anatomic anomalies include cleft palates, cranial deformities, agenesis of the small or large intestines, respiratory and cardiac anomalies, extensive umbilical or diaphragmatic hernias, anomalies of the kidneys and lower urinary tract, and musculoskeletal anomalies. Congenital anomalies of microanatomic or biochemical type probably account for an equal number of puppy and kitten losses (Pedersen, 1991) .

Many faders that die in the first weeks of life are of normal size, but their growth is slow, and their weight is well below normal at the time of death; therefore, it is important to not only weigh puppies and kittens at birth but also to weigh at frequent intervals until they are at least 6 weeks of age or completely weaned.",

The animal's breed, mental status, and general body condition should be assessed. An animal with stunted growth and poor body condition is likely to suffer from malnutrition or hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, or cardiac disease. Most endocrinopathies that result in poor growth leave the animal in good physical condition compared with the effects of the metabolic diseases. Certain breeds or lines of dogs and cats may exhibit a higher than normal incidence of failure to thrive, which may be indicative of an underlying genetic disorder.

It is preferable to sacrifice the puppy or kitten and perform a fresh necropsy as soon as it becomes apparent that death is inevitable. Puppies and kittens that die before they are euthanized should be immediately refrigerated; freezing ruins tissue for gross and histopathologic examination. Competent people must do the necropsy. Gross abnormalities are often subtle and may go unnoticed by untrained eyes. Representative tissue should be taken as aseptically as possible and frozen for microbiologic (i.e., viral, bacterial, and fungal cultures) or toxicologic studies, should they prove to be necessary. A wide sampling of tissue should also be preserved in formalin for histopathologic examination. Formalin-fixed tissue, along with detailed descriptions of gross lesions and clinical histories, should then be forwarded to veterinary pathologists for microscopic examination. If tissue indicates an infectious or toxic disease as the cause of death, samples of frozen tissue can then be submitted to competent microbiologists or toxicologists for further study.",
