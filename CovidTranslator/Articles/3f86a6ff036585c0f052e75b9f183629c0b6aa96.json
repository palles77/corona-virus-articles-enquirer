Their valuable time and insights, shared during a series of cross-sector consultations beginning in 2010, helped build a comprehensive pathogen and toxin framework and its supporting programs that strengthened biosafety management systems to safeguard public health in Canada.We would also like to thank our multidisciplinary group of colleagues both internal and external to the Centre for Biosecurity and the Agency. In particular the advice, support and continued contribution from colleagues in the Department of Justice and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency have been essential for the full implementation of the Act and Regulations.",
