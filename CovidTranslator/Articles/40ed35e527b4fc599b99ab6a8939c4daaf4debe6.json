Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of the EVD Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) educational program. Methods: Informational sessions, online course links, and a targeted, self-directed slide presentation were developed and implemented for the EVD educational program. Three student surveys administered at different time points were used to evaluate the program and change in students' EVD knowledge, confidence in knowledge, and risk concern. Discussion: Implementation of a JiTT educational program effectively achieved our goals to increase EVD knowledge, decrease fear, and enhance student confidence in the ability to discuss EVD risk. These achievements were sustained over time. Conclusion: JiTT methodology is an effective strategy for schools of nursing to respond quickly and comprehensively during an unanticipated infectious disease outbreak.",

            "text": "The Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic of 2014/2015 presented Atlanta-area health care providers, health care professions schools, and students a unique challenge to quickly prepare for the care of EVD-infected aid workers from African countries affected by this disease. The decision to accept these patients resulted in the activation and expansion of the serious communicable diseases unit (SCDU) at Emory University Hospital (Feistritzer, Hill, Vanairsdale, & Gentry, 2014) . Intense public interest followed the decision and resulted in tremendous media coverage. Between July 31 and September 22, 2014, >42,000 stories went out on broadcast and >18,000 print stories were written mentioning Emory and Ebola (\"Telling the Story,\" 2014). Some of the attention heightened the fear and anxiety associated with caring for individuals in our community because of the highly infectious nature of EVD. People spoke out on social media, fearing that our caring for these patients put our larger community at risk. In response to the public outcry, Susan Grant, the Chief Nurse for Emory Healthcare wrote in the Washington Post, \"We can either let our actions be guided by misunderstanding, fear, and self-interest or we can lead by knowledge, science and compassion. We can fear, or we can care.\" (Grant, 2014) .",

Both the CDC and Emory Healthcare are key partners for the clinical and public health education of our student nurses. The treatment of patients with EVD at Emory University Hospital, combined with our CDC colleagues' response to the EVD epidemic in Africa and the status of Atlanta being a major international transportation hub, necessitated a swift response by key public health faculty and administration of the NHWSN to educate our students and fellow faculty colleagues and staff members about EVD. EVD education needed to include modes of transmission, risk for exposure and transmission, signs and symptoms of infection, therapy, and counseling techniques to allay fear and anxiety associated with living in Atlanta and working or training within the health care facilities treating EVD-infected patients. It was our goal to increase EVD knowledge, decrease fear, and enhance students' confidence in their ability to discuss EVD risk with family and friends.",

Providing information expeditiously during complex humanitarian emergencies, such as a disease outbreak, is essential to quelling the fears of nursing students, who may encounter affected patients during clinical rotations, and communities who are uncertain about essential facts and who might be influenced by media coverage that at times dwells on unpleasant details and fuels the public's apprehensions (Stirling, Harmston, & Alsobayel, 2015; \"Teaching in a time,\" 2015) .

Interested students and faculty attended other educational events at our university's School of Public Health.

Additional goals for providing education were to increase student knowledge of EVD risks and ways to mitigate exposure, decrease fear of EVD, and enhance students' confidence in discussing EVD with others, including family, friends, and patients. Faculty course coordinators of classes addressing professional role content for each cohort of undergraduate students created an Ebola information page on their electronic course sites. The Ebola information content included links to CDC, Emory Healthcare, and other Atlanta-area health care EVD policies and guidelines. In addition, a 23-slide PowerPoint presentation was developed using CDC guidelines and the newly developed Emory Healthcare Ebola Preparedness Protocols. The presentation, posted on the course sites, included an overview of the EVD outbreak, EVD facts, modes of transmission, signs and symptoms of early and later stage infection, Emory University's EVD-specific travel policies, Emory Healthcare's publically available Ebola Preparedness Protocols, and CDC's published \"Frequently Asked Questions\" and answers.

The data manager did not serve in a faculty capacity to any of the students at the time. The e-mail stated that faculty were interested in students' perceptions about educational information that had already been provided to them about EVD and their experiences and level of comfort with discussing EVD with others, such as family members. The e-mail invitation described that the new education program included completing a pretest, viewing a PowerPoint slideshow, and completing two post-tests (immediately after the training and five weeks later) and that participation was completely voluntary. The pre-and post-tests were identical. Students were enrolled in one of three classes, and faculty members teaching those classes agreed to offer a small incentive in the form of bonus points to students who participated in the study. Application of the bonus points was determined by the individual faculty member for each course.",

Time to complete the pretest was estimated to be about 15 min. The pretest link remained active for 3 days after the initial e-mail was sent. The pre-test survey consisted of three demographic questions, one item related to who they may have already provided any EVD information to, two questions related to the student's confidence level providing education to others about EVD, one item asking if they felt they needed additional EVD training, 13 knowledge questions, two questions related to the student's level of concern about their risk to EVD, and one question about attendance at recent campus educational programs about EVD. A few of the students either did not receive the initial e-mail or did not receive a valid link to the pre-test; these issues were resolved by sending e-mails to these students individually. The survey link was e-mailed again to students who experienced technological difficulties; no duplicate surveys occurred as a feature of the RedCap system.",

Missing items on the knowledge test portion were treated as incorrect responses. Most of the data collected were categorical and ordinal in nature; thus, most items were summarized using percentages and frequencies. Age was normally distributed, so the mean and standard deviation were reported. Descriptive statistics were compiled for all student characteristics, demographics, knowledge test scores, training needs, comfort, and confidence items. Knowledge scores were computed as the percentage correct out of the 13 EVD content items. The two concern items and three confidence items were scaled with four response ordinal categories (not at all, somewhat, very, and extremely). The two concern items were averaged together, and the three confidence items were averaged together. Reliability was assessed for each of the averaged items using standardized Cronbach alpha and the split-half SpearmaneBrown formula (Eisinga, Grotenhuis, & Pelzer, 2013) . Average concern was significantly right skewed and still ordinal in nature and was dichotomized into subjects who were \"not at all\" concerned (score \u00bc 1) vs. those who were somewhat to extremely concerned (scores > 1). Average confidence was also right skewed and still ordinal in nature and was also dichotomized into subjects who were \"not at all\" or \"somewhat\" confident (scores 2) and those who were \"very\" or \"extremely\" confident (scores > 2).",
