Continued lactose tolerance in adults is an example of a trait that has evolved in certain populations within the last 10,000 years, since the domestication of milkproducing livestock (Tishkoff et al. 2006; Swallow 2003) . \"If a doctor can become aware of how all these different traits actually interact with each other, then you begin to see your individual patient as something that isn't just the symptom sitting in front of you in the office that day,\" Stearns says. \"If you treat that symptom, then the perspective of evolutionary biology will tell you what all of the possible associated reactions are. The point is, they're a bit broader, and they may contain more surprises than a strictly medical orientation would give you. Evolution gives you a broader view of the whole way an organism reacts, and why it does sobecause it's been shaped by evolution in certain ways.\" Psychiatrist Randolph Nesse of the University of Michigan, a strong advocate of evolutionary medicine, agrees: \"Once a doctor starts understanding how the body came to be, instead of seeing the body as a machine-which it's not-he or she starts seeing the body as a product of natural selection, where everything in the body is pretty good, because it's got to be, and nothing is perfect\u2026.This perspective is needed for literally every aspect of the body that's vulnerable to disease. Why hasn't natural selection made it better? There are always good reasons.\"",

Just looking at mating success, high testosterone levels may provide a man with a competitive advantage in securing a mate, but will also decrease his resistance to pathogens and parasites (Muehlenbein and Bribiescas 2005) . A woman who has regular and frequent menstrual cycles has more opportunities to become pregnant, but is also at increased risk of cancer (Strassmann 1999) . Exposure to higher hormone levels, either incidentally or by design, can have unexpected side effects because of this evolutionary trade-off. Reproductive success is ultimately the more important factor in evolution, as one's evolutionary fitness is measured by the number of offspring that survive to reproductive age themselves. The compromise results from the fact that we produce only one or two offspring at a time, and human offspring require extended parental care. Humans who threw everything into mating but did not survive long enough to raise the few resulting offspring would be unsuccessful because their offspring would not survive either. Radically changing traits that have been shaped over time runs the very real risk of tipping the balance in unexpected, and potentially unpleasant, directions.",

Agriculture required groups to abandon a mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyle and live in sedentary populations, such as farming villages. Ultimately, agriculture provided the ability to support large urban populations. Sedentary groups encounter issues such as accumulation of wastes and transmission of epidemic diseases (Armelagos et al. 2005) , issues that increase with population size. Even more recently, increases in expected life span and change in diets have led to a rise in the frequency of chronic diseases (Armelagos et al. 2005; Leonard 2007 ).

In simple terms, many aspects of our modern environment and lifestyle, including diet, exercise, exposure to chemicals, hygienic practices and circumstances, and a variety of other elements, are mismatched to our bodies' evolutionary state. For example, if-thanks to our prehistoric ancestors-our physiology is evolutionarily hardwired for low caloric intake and intense physical activity, our rich modern diets and sedentary lifestyles mismatch our innate metabolism (Neel 1962; Wang and Mariman 2008) . Evolutionary medicine tells us that many of today's so-called \"diseases of civilization\" that are so highly prevalent and growing rapidly in incidence, such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, may well be fueled by a metabolic mismatch (Leonard 2007) . This phenomenon can be readily observed in contemporary populations that have undergone a \"nutrition transition\" in which rapid socioeconomic, demographic, and technological changes have brought profound changes in diet and activity patterns, often resulting in sudden and widespread increases in metabolic disorders. For example, a recent paper examined the changes in diet and health in the rapidly urbanizing black South African population. The study found that the change in lifestyle was accompanied not only by an improvement in micronutrients but also by an increase in obesity and chronic diseases (Vorster et al. 2005 ). Characterizing such mismatches through the use of today's analytical tools promises to shed important new light on the etiology of these and many other common, complex disorders (e.g., autoimmune, inflammatory, and mental/behavioral conditions) and offers an innovative approach to the identification of novel interventions and therapies.",

For example, recent studies have demonstrated a connection between decreased intestinal parasite load and increased incidence of autoimmune diseases such as asthma (Lau and Matricardi 2006) . In one study, children who had been dewormed showed an increase in the occurrence of allergic reactions to house mites. Why? What was the link between removing worms and developing allergies? One proposed explanation is the \"hygiene hypothesis\" (Strachan 1989) , which takes an evolutionary view and considers that the historically \"normal\" condition for humans is a constant barrage of parasites and that the immune response evolved in response to these conditions. An over-reactive immune system is a recognized cause of allergies, and it turns out that the presence of helminthes, common intestinal parasites, actually increases regulation and control of the immune response. When these children were dewormed, regulation of their immune response decreased, allowing an allergic response to house mites. An interesting application of this research is the experimental use of intestinal parasites in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as irritable bowl syndrome, Crohn's disease, and multiple sclerosis (Wickelgren 2004) .",

Occasionally, more serious complications arise. However, there is significant evidence that this physiological process is associated with successful pregnancies (Weigel and Weigel 1989) . One tested hypothesis posits that this response is beneficial to both mother and embryo because it reduces the mother's intake of, and embryo's exposure to, potentially toxic chemicals and pathogens during key developmental stages (Flaxman and Sherman 2000) . In addition, the foods most commonly avoided are animal products which tend to harbor more pathogens than plant foods. The immune system of pregnant women is depressed to avoid rejection of the fetus, so both mother and embryo are at higher risk from pathogens. The benefits of this response may well justify the discomfort and risks-or at least provide some psychological comfort to suffering women.",

One need look no farther than the local news or health clinic for proof. The evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains of tuberculosis made the news in spring 2007 when a man with extremely drugresistant (XDR) TB made multiple international flights (CNN 2007) . Fortunately, no one else was infected in this instance, but the recent evolution of drug-resistant TB has revived old fears, especially in places where the complicated medical treatment required for these strains is not available. Evolutionary medicine can help physicians take into account the effects of people's changing environments and lifestyles. Human behaviors such as conflict, poverty, and urbanization provide opportunities for infectious diseases to spread (Halstead 1996) . Today, more people live in areas of high population density-a change from the more traditional small community. High population density urban centers are ideal for transmission of pathogens, particularly when coupled with high rates of poverty (Armelagos et al. 2005) .",

For example, logging brings roads to new areas, providing easy access for local inhabitants who come to hunt for food. In the process, hunters either become prey themselves as they are infected by novel pathogens or bring the pathogens back to populated areas in the form of bush meat (Chomel et al. 2007 ). Sometimes, the infection is relatively benignfor example, children often pick up worms from household pets-but sometimes, the transfer is deadly. The ancestor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the simian immunodeficiency virus, which is found in a wide range of primate species and rarely causes disease in the primate host (Hahn et al. 2000) despite the fact that HIV is devastating in humans.",

When the mysterious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus emerged on the world scene, researchers quickly gathered information about its physical structure, life cycle, and genetics. By comparing its characteristics with those of known viruses, researchers were able to quickly identify the novel SARS virus as a coronavirus (WHO 2003) . That crucial piece of information allowed health care professionals to develop appropriate diagnostic tools, preventive measures, and treatments based on knowledge of how other coronaviruses behave. Additionally, the information about viral type allowed field researchers to identify the source of the infection based on known hosts of coronaviruses. Civet cats, sold live in meat markets, were frequently found to be infected with a SARS virus. Further research indicated that horseshoe bats, which were also sold in these markets, had a more ancestral variant of the virus (Britigan 2005; Lau et al. 2005; Wendong et al. 2005) . The virus was also found to be more widespread in bats. The civet cats probably act as an intermediate host, or \"amplifier.\" Understanding the lifestyle and environment in which the disease arose helped to rapidly control it, preventing a feared worldwide epidemic.",

Evolutionary medicine plays a critical role in the interpretation and application of this information, since human evolutionary history has shaped the genome. Humans as a species are relatively young with a mere 100,000-year history. The pattern of our relatively recent global dispersal from our home in Africa is reflected in our genes.

Comparisons between the human genome and more distantly related organisms provide information about ancient genes that play important roles in fundamental processes such as development and physiology.

In a recent GWA, researchers identified genomic polymorphisms potentially associated with seven different diseases (Wellcome 2007). This information can be used to guide future research on the genetics of these diseases. The GWA is yet another method based on enormous data sets that may lead to significant advances in medicine. Resources to promote this kind of megaanalysis include the Human Genome Project and the HapMap, which uses collections of single-nucleotide differences as markers for larger genetic regions. The HapMap is important because genomes of any two humans differ only by 0.1%. Researchers can use the general markers from the HapMap to narrow down their searches to areas of variation.",

This is a difficult problem for several reasons: genomic data are not usually collected from a specific individual with an extensive health history; family medical histories are rarely complete; environmental conditions vary between populations, etc. One approach to deal with this issue is the use of large, long-term studies of specific populations. The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is the quintessential large cohort, long-term study. Initiated in 1948 to investigate the causes of heart disease and stroke, the project collected data on more than 5,000 people living in Framingham, Massachusetts. In addition to birth, marriage, reproduction, and death data, the participants were given physical exams and lifestyle interviews. Followup physicals were given every 2 years. Adult children of the original cohort and the children's spouses, as well as the original cohort's grandchildren, also participated in the study. This study allowed researchers to identify the major environmental risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as smoking and high blood pressure. Because of the extensive data collected for the project and the virtually unprecedented length of the study, the FHS is incredibly valuable to medical researchers. The data are now being mined by groups researching other diseases such as obesity and eye and lung diseases.
