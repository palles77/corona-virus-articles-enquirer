GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Of all of the organ systems, the respiratory tract may be unique in its vulnerability to injurious agents. The involuntary nature of ventilation, necessitated by aerobic respiration and the need for oxygen, actively pulls large volumes of air into the lungs (estimated at 5,400 L/day in dogs and 11,400 L/day in horses). Along with this air, there is a variety of potentially injurious materials. In addition, the flow of the entire cardiac output through the extensive and delicate vascular bed of the gas exchange region of the lungs provides a separate avenue for the delivery of potentially harmful substances to the respiratory tract. These dual exposure routes are particularly important in determining the expression of disease in the lung, with distinct patterns of lesions depending on whether the route of entry is airborne (aerogenous) or vascular (hematogenous) . The array of potentially injurious agents includes airborne microorganisms, particulates, and toxic gases in ambient air, and a wide variety of infectious agents and extrinsic or intrinsic toxins delivered via the pulmonary circulation. Together, the injury, inflammation, and reparative responses to these insults compromise the gas exchange functions of the respiratory system.",

There, the ventral, middle, and dorsal meatuses are demarcated by the osseous and cartilaginous conchae (turbinates). Air flows past the ethmoid conchae in the caudal nasal cavity, through the choanae and into the nasopharynx. The presence of respiratory turbinates is restricted to mammals and birds, and is assumed to be important in the evolution of endothermy and the high levels of oxygen consumption associated with metabolism in these species; similar structures are not present in ectothermic animals. Functionally, the respiratory turbinates warm and humidify the inspired air to prevent desiccation of the lower respiratory tract, and reclaim moisture and heat from the saturated vapor leaving the lungs. The nasal submucosa is richly supplied with a complex vascular plexus, nerves, and mucosal glands. In addition to the air-warming functions, most species have vascular shunts between the respiratory turbinates and the brain vasculature, suggesting a role in cooling the brain during periods of intense activity in mammals and birds. Stimulation of the parasympathetic innervation in the nasal cavity leads to increased vascular permeability and mucosal gland secretion, which may occlude the nasal airways and increase resistance to airflow. This is countered by the sympathetic nerve fibers, which favor vasoconstriction and decreased vascular permeability.",

The relative distribution and extent of each of these cell types vary among species. Stratified squamous epithelium is confined to the nasal vestibule at the entrance to the nasal cavity. Separating the squamous epithelium from the more caudal respiratory epithelium is a zone of nonciliated cuboidal to columnar cells, the transitional epithelium. Most of the epithelium lining the nasal mucosa is composed of pseudostratified respiratory epithelium. This is a complex epithelium that includes ciliated, mucous, nonciliated, and basal cells (Fig. 5-1) . Olfactory epithelium is located in the caudal and caudodorsal nasal cavity, lining the ethmoid conchae. This is the most phylogenetically conserved of the nasal epithelium, reflecting the ancient origins of olfaction. The epithelium is composed of olfactory sensory neuronsbipolar neurons that have immotile cilia forming dendritic knobs bearing the olfactory receptors-as well as sustentacular cells and basal cells. Olfactory mucosa is readily recognized by a line of sustentacular cell nuclei at the mid-level of the epithelium, basal cells adjacent to basal lamina, and olfactory neurons scattered between these 2 layers, as well as Bowman's glands and prominent olfactory nerves in the lamina propria (see Fig. 5 -1). Olfactory epithelium is rich in cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. These enzymes are essential for olfaction, and their biotransformation activity confers susceptibility to inhaled or ingested toxins, such as 3-methylindole in horses.",

In humans, pigs, and cattle, lobulation is highly developed, with individual lobules readily seen on the pleural surface of the lung. Equine, ovine, and caprine lungs are intermediate in lobulation; canine and feline lung are essentially devoid of septation and lobule formation. A bronchopulmonary segment is the area served by a tertiary bronchus that arises from the lobar (secondary) bronchi. Well-developed interlobular septa that nearly completely surround individual bronchopulmonary segments, as in the pig and cow, limit collateral ventilation as well as the movement of cells and molecules between adjacent segments. Functionally, this is important in these species in limiting the extension of inflammation between lobules. Well-developed connective tissue septa can effectively sequester inflammation in affected lobules, leading to the characteristic gross lesions especially common in bacterial bronchopneumonia, with severely affected lobules adjacent to those less affected. The lack of collateral ventilation is also largely responsible for the common, incidental, interlobular emphysema found in cattle lungs at the time of autopsy.",

This unique system of perfusing the lung with blood has implications in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease. The pulmonary arterial circulation receives the entire output of the right ventricle and is characterized as a high-flow, low-pressure system. In contrast, the bronchial arterial circulation, being a part of the systemic arterial blood vasculature, is a low-flow, high-pressure system. The bronchial circulation can arise from a variety of sites, including the aorta, intercostal arteries, and subclavian arteries. It delivers nutrition to the bronchi and bronchioles, and in some species also to the blood vessels, pleura, and much of the interstitium. Species vary in their vascular supply. The bronchial artery supplies the airways of dogs, and its obstruction causes bronchiolar necrosis, whereas this does not occur in rabbits because of contributions by the pulmonary artery. In cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses, the bronchial circulation also supplies the pleura, whereas in species with thin pleurae (dogs, cats, rodents), the pulmonary circulation serves this function.

The function of the guttural pouches is not completely understood, but they may play a role in cooling blood destined for the brain during periods of intense activity and respiration. This respiratory-based cooling mechanism is facilitated by the anatomy of the internal carotid artery as it courses in a crease along the caudal wall up to the dorsal surface of the pouches.

Within the pleura and just below it, the interstitial space leading into proper lymphatics can be considered as prelymphatic space. This is a site of fluid accumulation during pulmonary edema and also, given that it collects fluids bathing the entirety of the surrounding tissue, is important in delivering antigens to regional lymph nodes. The prelymphatics in the pleura blend into reservoir lymphatics, which eventually connect with conduit lymphatics. Within the lung, saccular and tubulosaccular lymphatics surround all airways and noncapillary blood vessels (arteries and veins). These lymphatics are large (some >100 \u00b5m) and thin walled. Although they are histologically indistinct and are often overlooked, the lymphatics distend greatly with fluid as a result of pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Metastatic emboli filling lymphatics sometimes reveal the distribution of the pulmonary lymphatic system, and aggregates of inflammatory cells may accumulate around terminal airways and blood vessels in association with the local lymphatics. Thus the lung lymphatic system is important in fluid movement, regulating alveolar hydration, and acting as a conduit for movement of antigens, leukocytes, and metastasizing neoplasms.",

However, smooth muscle cells can undergo hyperplasia in response to paracrine signals arising from the airway epithelium in inflammatory diseases, and this doubtless contributes to the accentuation of smooth muscle found histologically in chronic bronchitis and asthma. Further, smooth muscle cells produce a wide array of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix metalloproteases, allowing them to modify the interstitial matrix directly around smooth muscle bundles. These cells also secrete matrix proteins, including fibronectin, elastin, and a variety of laminins and collagens, which then modulates the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of the smooth muscle cells.

In terrestrial mammals, the radially arranged alveolar septa are tethered to and pull on the bronchiolar wall to maximize the luminal diameter during peak lung volume during inspiration. During expiration, as the forces from the alveolar septa decrease, the bronchiolar lumen decreases in diameter. Because of their smaller diameter, collapsibility and thin-walled structure, bronchioles are much more susceptible to disease processes occurring in the surrounding alveolar parenchyma than are bronchi, and they individually have a higher resistance to airflow than individual bronchi.

The contribution of these cells to the airway surface liquid includes not only mucus but also the innate defense molecules (see Lung defenses, later), immunoregulatory proteins such as club cell secretory protein and annexin A1, and cellular defense molecules, including antioxidants and trefoil factor. Mucous cells (goblet cells) are a source of mucins that form the mucus layer of the epithelial lining fluid. Club cells (formerly known as Clara cells) are nonciliated non-mucus-secreting cells that predominate in the distal airway of many species. The club cell functions as a progenitor cell for epithelial repair within the airway mucosa, as it has the capacity to divide and differentiate into other secretory cells or ciliated cells. Club cells of many species have abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum that possesses high concentrations of cytochrome 20.0 m in experimental and human cases of pulmonary fibrosis. For example, the presence or absence of Thy-1 on lung fibroblasts is associated with variation in fibroblast adhesion to extracellular matrix, production of cytokines, and ability to produce extracellular matrix proteins including collagen.

With each breath, there is cycling between the subsurface surfactant reservoir and the bioactive surface film. Similarly, tubular myelin is constantly converted to a less functional vesicular form that must be recycled by type II pneumocytes or degraded by alveolar macrophages. SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C are important for secretion and recycling of the surfactant lipid, formation of tubular myelin, and the proper insertion of these lipids into the alveolar surface film.

Mucociliary clearance may be as rapid as 10 mm per minute in the trachea, but the pace in the bronchioles is more languid. The airways are covered by a periciliary liquid layer (formerly known as the sol or hypophase) and a superficial mucous layer. The mucous layer contains abundant glycoproteins that are sticky and tend to trap a wide variety of particles that impact on the airway surfaces. The function of the periciliary liquid layer has long been considered to simply provide an aqueous medium in which the cilia can beat. However, recent evidence indicates that this layer forms a periciliary brush composed of mucins that transiently tether the cilia to the overlying mucus, trap water to maintain hydration, and prevent the mucus and other luminal substances from entering the periciliary layer. The quality of the periciliary liquid layer is also critical for clearance of entrapped particulates, because the low viscosity of this fluid permits the cilia of the epithelial cells to beat effectively. Additionally, clearance of sputum from the larger airways by coughing requires that the periciliary liquid layer be fluid and abundant, allowing the superficial mucous layer Interstitial macrophages are the least well-understood class of pulmonary macrophages.

The nasopharyngeal lymphoid (Waldeyer's) ring is a collection of lymphoid tissues that encircles the oropharynx and nasopharynx of animals. The degree of organization of this lymphoid tissue varies by species. In addition, there are lymphoid follicles and loose aggregates of mononuclear cells within the lamina propria. These lymphoid tissues induce a local immune response, and also stimulate a systemic immune reaction to nasally delivered antigens. This tissue is particularly prominent in foals, and gives a finely nodular appearance to the pharyngeal mucosa.",

The main causes include viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections; allergens; inhalation of irritant gases; and particulate dusts (Box 5-1). Most cases of significant acute rhinitis begin with serous exudation, which changes in the course of the disease to become catarrhal, purulent, or hemorrhagic. With pseudomembranous rhinitis, fibrinous membranes can be peeled off without leaving gross underlying defects. In contrast, fibrinonecrotic (diphtheritic) membranes adhere firmly to the underlying tissue, leave a raw ulcerated surface when removed, and are most commonly caused by inhalation of epitheliotoxic gases, alphaherpesviruses, or bacteria such as Fusobacterium necrophorum. Histologically, in acute rhinitis, the epithelial cells are normal or show hydropic degeneration, loss of cilia, or attenuation. Goblet cells may be inapparent from having secreted their contents, or may be hyperplastic. The lamina propria is lesions include nasal trauma, severe rhinitis (lymphoplasmacytic, eosinophilic, or suppurative), mycotic infections of the nasal cavity or the guttural pouch, tooth root abscesses, and neoplasms. In contrast, bilateral epistaxis may indicate a severe manifestation of the above, hemorrhagic diatheses such as those causing thrombocytopenia, or lesions in or distal to the nasopharynx. The latter include pulmonary contusions, purpura hemorrhagica in horses, exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage in horses, rupture of embolic pulmonary abscesses in cattle, pulmonary neoplasia or granulomas, pulmonary hypertension, or vasculitis.

In cats, nasopharyngeal stenosis appears as more uniform membranous narrowing of the opening between the nasopharynx and the caudal nasal cavity.

            "text": "Of the round-cell neoplasms, lymphoma is most frequent, particularly in cats. Nasal lymphoma in cats is usually primary, arising from the nasal cavity or uncommonly the nasopharynx, and is not associated with retroviral infection. Less often, nasal tissues can be secondarily affected in cases of multiorgan lymphoma. Feline nasal lymphoma is easily confused with carcinoma, because the large neoplastic cells are often arranged as dense sheets, and faint packeting can result from the presence of delicate bands of stroma. The vast majority are of diffuse large B-cell phenotype, but low-grade follicular B-cell lymphoma as well T-cell lymphoma do occur. Epitheliotropism suggests a T-cell phenotype, yet nasal epitheliotropic B-cell lymphoma is reported. Diffuse large B-cell nasal lymphoma can develop in other organs as the disease progresses basophilic mucus. Lakes of this same material are present between the nests of cells. Transitional carcinomas (nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinomas) form nodules or nests of stratified cuboidal epithelium that lack keratinization ; microcysts are sometimes present within the epithelial layers and must be distinguished from the acini seen in adenocarcinomas. Adenosquamous (mucoepidermoid) carcinomas have mucin-filled acinar components and foci with squamous differentiation, and are reported to be more aggressive tumors. Squamous cell carcinomas are similar to those seen in other organs, with nodules or nests of epithelial cells that keratinize to form abundant glassy eosinophilic cytoplasm and occasional central aggregates of keratin. These are frequent tumors in the cat, where most originate from the nasal vestibule, and in the horse, where the maxillary sinus is a common site. Acinic cell carcinomas have a faintly packeted or acinar arrangement of cells that resemble salivary serous cells, with abundant pale cytoplasm containing fine basophilic periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive diastase-resistant granules; this type is invasive, but metastases are not expected. Oncocytomas form cords or nests of large epithelioid cytokeratinpositive cells with angular borders, with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm containing numerous mitochondria that appear as fine phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin (PTAH)-positive granules; the few cases reported had either noninvasive or invasive growth habits. Neuroendocrine carcinomas have delicate septa of fibrous stroma separating nests or packets of neoplastic epithelial cells and express synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and other markers of neuroendocrine differentiation. Because these markers are also expressed by some adenocarcinomas, the morphologic features are essential for the diagnosis. Undifferentiated carcinomas are solid epithelial neoplasms that lack the patterns of differentiation mentioned previously. Differential diagnoses for nasal carcinomas in general include lymphoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, and amelanotic malignant melanoma. The distinction between carcinoma and lymphoma can be particularly difficult in cats, and immunohistochemistry may be needed to resolve uncertainty. Benign epithelial neoplasms are rare but include papilloma (eFig. 5-7), adenoma, and basal cell tumor (of the vestibule). The pharynx, as the site where the respiratory and alimentary systems conjoin, is exposed to both inhaled and ingested materials, some of which may have deleterious effects on the animal. In pigs, a caudal diverticulum of the pharynx lies immediately dorsal to the esophagus. In young pigs, plant awns and similar foreign materials occasionally lodge in this diverticulum, causing pharyngitis and cellulitis that may lead to dysphagia and death from starvation. Iatrogenic pharyngitis, even with perforation of the caudodorsal wall of the pharynx, may occur in cattle during incorrect oral administration of boluses or esophageal intubation.",

Suppurative inflammation leading to guttural pouch empyema occurs mostly after upper respiratory infections, particularly with Streptococcus equi or other streptococci. Guttural pouch mycosis, generally caused by Aspergillus spp., causes fibrinonecrotic inflammation that extends deeply to invade vessels and other structures . Thus severe complications are much more likely than for guttural pouch empyema. Guttural pouch inflammation can extend to involve nearby vessels, cranial nerves (VII, IX, X, XI, XII), and the cranial sympathetic trunk, or even spread to adjacent bones, middle ear, brain, or atlanto-occipital joint. Thus erosion of the internal or external carotid artery or the maxillary artery causes epistaxis, damage to the glossopharyngeal or vagus nerves causes dysphagia, damage to the cranial sympathetic trunk or cranial cervical ganglion causes Horner's syndrome, or damage to the facial nerve causes facial paralysis. Other complications include laryngeal hemiparesis, or permanent dorsal displacement of the soft palate. Guttural pouch hemorrhage may also result from fracture of the basisphenoid bone. A less common condition is guttural pouch tympany. This (22-67% of cases, depending on the study), but invasion of local tissues, including brain, is the more common clinical problem.

Entrapment of the epiglottis below the aryepiglottic fold is usually associated with congenital hypoplasia or acquired shortening or distortion of the epiglottis. A short epiglottis also predisposes to dorsal displacement of the soft palate, and these conditions sometimes occur together. Persistent frenulum of the epiglottis has been reported in newborn foals, predisposing to oronasal reflux of milk after nursing and aspiration pneumonia. The persistent frenulum of the epiglottis leads to dorsal displacement of the soft palate, which can be assessed endoscopically. Laryngeal paralysis in horses is frequently subclinical but may cause abnormal respiratory noise (roaring) and poor performance. The condition is almost always a left-sided hemiplegia caused by idiopathic degeneration of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The resulting denervation atrophy affects the intrinsic laryngeal muscles supplied by this nerve, but the atrophy is not uniform; the lateral cricoarytenoid muscle is affected first and most severely, followed by the dorsal cricoarytenoid. Grossly, the affected muscles are pale and atrophic ( Fig. 5-9 ). The cricothyroid muscle, which is supplied by the cranial laryngeal nerve, is the only intrinsic muscle not affected. Because the dorsal cricoarytenoid muscle is the main abductor of the larynx, denervation atrophy and dysfunction of this muscle allows the left arytenoid cartilage to sag into the lumen and obstruct airflow during inspiration.

It may include stenotic nares, insufficient pharyngeal space for the soft palate (\"elongation\" and thickening of the soft palate), and tracheal hypoplasia. In this syndrome, tracheal hypoplasia appears as reduced diameter of the lumen resulting from small tracheal rings, with an inapparent dorsal tracheal ligament. Greater negative intraluminal pressures during forced inspiration secondarily cause eversion of laryngeal saccules, hypertrophied and folded pharyngeal mucosa, everted tonsils, laryngeal edema, collapse of the larynx, and/or collapse of the trachea with overlapping of the ends of the cartilage rings . These factors aggravate the problem by further obstructing airflow, as does mucosal thickening or exudates resulting from tracheitis or pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is often present in fatal cases. A comparable condition resulting from narrowing of the larynx occurs in Norwich Terriers. Tracheal collapse refers to dorsoventral narrowing of the trachea resulting in coughing and exercise intolerance. The disease is most common in middle-aged miniature breeds of dogs and is described in miniature horses. The cartilage rings are abnormally shaped and form shallow arcs, and the dorsal tracheal muscle (tracheal membrane) is widened and flaccid ( Fig. 5-12 ). The condition is not limited to the trachea; bronchoscopy reveals bronchomalacia and collapse in many affected dogs. Earlier descriptions of the histologic and histochemical features associated with tracheal collapse describe foci of hypocellularity of the hyaline cartilage and areas where cartilage is replaced by fibrous and/or fibrocartilaginous tissue.

Papillomas involving the larynx are usually part of widespread papillomatosis, as may be seen in immunocompromised animals. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor. The laryngeal epithelium has a florid hyperplastic response to underlying inflammation, so care should be taken in differentiating (non-neoplastic) pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia from laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Plasmacytoma is a round cell tumor with eccentric nuclei, abundant glassy cytoplasm, and occasional karyomegaly or multinucleation. As for alimentary plasmacytoma, laryngeal plasmacytoma has a more aggressive course than those arising in skin. Laryngeal neoplasms consisting of cells with abundant granular cytoplasm include rhabdomyoma, oncocytoma, and granular cell tumor. Laryngeal rhabdomyoma occurs in young dogs as a solitary benign raised nodule in or near the lateral ventricle of the larynx (eFig. 5-12). It consists of lobular masses of angular pleomorphic cells with abundant deeply eosinophilic granular or foamy cytoplasm . Although this appearance has been interpreted as an oncocytoma, the diagnosis of rhabdomyoma is confirmed by demonstrating myosin and muscle-specific actin by using immunohistochemistry. Granular cell tumor, probably of Schwann cell origin, is less common in the larynx than in the tongue of dogs. The neoplastic cells have abundant cytoplasm with fine PAS-positive diastase-resistant granules (lysosomes and phagosomes), and are positive for S100 and vimentin. A miscellany of other neoplasms is described in the larynx (eFig. 5-13). Aitken The larynx is hypoplastic, with thickening of the mucosa and a narrow lumen. The trachea could be stretched to normal diameter, but is collapsed from excessively negative inspiratory pressure, causing overlap of the ends of the cartilage rings. Tracheal carcinoma is recognized in cats and rarely in dogs. Tracheal chondroma and osteochondroma is an uncommon condition of young dogs, and may represent a dysplastic cartilaginous mass rather than a true neoplasm. It forms an expansile mass of disorganized cartilage, with ossification of the central core of some lesions. known, but the increased prevalence during hot weather and the frequent presence of concurrent bronchopneumonia suggest that hyperpnea with negative intratracheal pressures during inspiration may cause mechanical injury to the tracheal mucosa.",

When investigating congenital masses of lung-like tissue, key observations include the location of the lesion and whether it is contained within the pleura or not, the continuity of the trachea and primary bronchus with the bronchi within the mass, and the nature of the pulmonary and systemic arterial supplies. Pulmonary hypoplasia is defined as reduced lung weight; hypoplastic lungs usually also have reduced numbers of alveoli . In contrast, the airways generally develop normally. Pulmonary hypoplasia may accompany malformations in other organs, and may include anasarca. Its development is closely linked to the presence of lung liquid that is secreted by the pulmonary epithelium, fills the airspaces, and is required for growth of the lung mass. Pulmonary hyperplasia is the result of overdistension of the lung, resulting from tracheal obstruction or laryngeal paralysis. In contrast, pulmonary hypoplasia ensues if the lung volume is not maintained. Pulmonary hypoplasia is caused by conditions that compress the lung, including congenital diaphragmatic hernia, intrathoracic masses, pleural effusions, or malformations of the thoracic cage; by oligohydramnios, in which the reduced uterine volume causes abnormal fetal positioning that compresses the chest and lungs; by impaired fetal breathing movements from abnormalities of the fetal nervous or musculoskeletal systems; by a tracheal fistula; and perhaps by reduced fluid secretion as a result of fetal hypoxemia or high levels of epinephrine.",

The growth of the conducting airways occurs primarily in the pseudoglandular stage; in most species, the airways develop through a series of asymmetrical dichotomous branching. Differentiation of conducting airway epithelial cells begins proximally and extends distally at this stage, with development of ciliated cells, mucous cells, basal cells, and bronchial cartilage. At the end of the pseudoglandular period, all branches of conducting airways have developed and are embedded in mesenchymal stroma. Distal airway branches are lined by cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells that contain abundant cytoplasmic glycogen. During the canalicular stage of growth (120-180 days of gestation), vascular \"canalization\" of the interstitium occurs, with capillaries growing in apposition to the airway epithelium to form the developing air-blood interface. Also during the canalicular stage, there is development of type II pneumocytes and type I pneumocytes within the newly formed terminal airspaces. Fetal lung development to the saccular stage (180-240 days gestation in the bovine fetus) is important for survival outside of the uterus. Lung volume and gas exchange surface increase markedly, and there is further reduction in mesenchyme between airspaces. The terminal branches of the conducting airways extend through the nascent parenchyma, and conditions are set for alveolar development. Small accumulations of elastic fibers, the site of secondary alveolar septal development, are deposited during this stage. During the alveolar stage of lung growth (240-260 days), true alveoli form by ingrowth of septa from intersaccular crests at the sites of elastic fiber deposition. These secondary septa have a doubled capillary layer separated by mesenchymal tissue (eFig. 5-15). The acquisition of a mature air-blood interface, with a single capillary layer, occurs after birth in the final stage of lung development, the stage of microvascular maturation. The end result is a reduction of the interstitium and maturation of the interalveolar wall. Further subdivision of alveolar septa results in continued increases in alveoli and alveolar surface area during a period of rapid postnatal growth. Airways increase in diameter and length through coordinated growth as overall lung volume and weight increase.",

They may be located anywhere in the thorax but are most frequent near the hilus of the lung or in the mediastinum.

Accessory lung (extralobar sequestration, choristoma) is a mass of pulmonary tissue completely separated from the lung (with a separate pleural covering) and found in the pleural space, mediastinum, or abdominal cavity. The term sequestration refers to the lack of connection to the normal airways. Bronchi are absent or rarely connect to the upper alimentary system (bronchopulmonary foregut malformations), and the mass is supplied by systemic but not pulmonary arteries. Various sequelae of bronchial obstruction probably underlie the following malformations, and indeed, several of these can occur together. Bronchial atresia or complete obstruction results in accumulation of secreted mucus in the isolated lung tissue distal to the defect. This excessive lung fluid induces hyperplasia of bronchial tissue (adenomatoid malformation) or alveolar tissue (polyalveolar lobe). Conversely, partial obstruction of a bronchus, such as from maldevelopment of the cartilage or compression by external masses, leads to air trapping within the distal areas of lung after birth (congenital lobar emphysema, described later in Pulmonary emphysema). Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (adenomatoid hamartoma) is characterized by one or more intrapulmonary masses that are swollen, spongy or cystic, fluid-or air-filled, and lobulated (eFig. 5-17). The masses are formed by cysts varying from microscopic to several centimeters in diameter, which are lined by pseudostratified columnar or cuboidal epithelium. In the microcystic form, these give the lung an adenoma-like appearance. Microcystic spaces are separated by loose connective tissue, whereas the larger cysts may have walls of fibromuscular tissue.

Atelectasis is a common artifact in immersion-fixed lung tissue. In congenital atelectasis, the lungs appear as in the fetus, but dark red-blue because of dilation of alveolar capillaries, of fleshy consistency and do not float . Obstructive atelectasis is caused by complete airway obstruction. Whether atelectasis follows obstruction depends on the size of airway obstructed and the degree of collateral ventilation. A lobular pattern of atelectasis suggests bronchial obstruction as the cause, prompting a search for the offending exudates or tumors. Compressive atelectasis is caused by pleural or intrapulmonary space-occupying lesions. Examples are hydrothorax, hemothorax, exudative pleuritis, and tumors. In large animals, the atelectasis caused by pleural effusions often occurs below a sharply demarcated fluid line. Abdominal distension, as in severe ascites and ruminal tympany, may cause partial atelectasis, typically in the cranial regions where ventilatory movements are most easily compromised by intra-abdominal pressure.

Interstitial emphysema without alveolar emphysema occurs frequently in cattle, presumably because of their well-developed interlobular septa and lack of collateral ventilation of the alveoli . It is an incidental finding in cattle at slaughter, and is common in recumbent (\"downer\") cows with periparturient paresis or toxic mastitis, where it may develop as cows forcibly exhale or grunt against a closed glottis. Thus the finding of interstitial emphysema in cattle does not necessarily imply primary lung disease. Dramatic interstitial emphysema occurs in cattle with respiratory distress caused by 3-methylindole toxicity, other toxins, or pneumonia caused by bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Interstitial emphysema in such cases may result from abnormally high intra-alveolar pressures caused by increased expiratory effort or bronchiolar obstruction, or perhaps from altered permeability or strength of the barrier between airspaces and interstitium.

Increased intracranial pressure from trauma to the central nervous system causes \"neurogenic pulmonary edema,\" probably related to catecholamine-induced pulmonary hypertension and increased vascular permeability. Hypoxia resulting blocking ventilation of the alveoli, obstructing gas exchange across the alveolar septa, and reducing the surface area of the air-liquid interface in the alveoli. In addition, proteins present in the edema fluid interfere with surfactant function, further reducing compliance and contributing to pulmonary dysfunction. Edema of the lung is, in many respects, similar to edema of other tissues, and is governed by the permeability of the vascular wall and by Starling forces-the balance of hydrostatic and osmotic pressures between the intravascular and interstitial compartments. Distinctive aspects of edema in the lung include the importance of type I pneumocytes as barriers to fluid movement, the role of type II pneumocytes and club cells in active transport of water from the alveolus, the effect of surface tension on fluid movement, and fluid exchanges between the alveolar and bronchiolar airspaces and the pulmonary interstitium.

Complementing the barrier function of the type I pneumocyte are Na + -K + -ATPase channels (sodium pumps) on the basolateral surface and passive sodium channels on the apical surface of type II pneumocytes. The net effect is to actively transport sodium out of the distal airspaces into the interstitium, drawing water along the same pathways by osmosis, thus resulting in a slow but steady flow of liquid from the alveoli to the interstitium. Drainage of interstitial fluid from the interstitium to the lymphatics is facilitated by negative pressure in the lymphatic vessels. In addition, the surface tension in airways may draw fluid out of alveoli into distal bronchioles, where fluid resorption by club cells is driven by a variety of ion channels.

Equine exercise-associated fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. Massive diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage and edema are among the most common causes of sudden death in racing horses. Because these animals die during or shortly after strenuous exercise, often in the warmer months, there is often considerable autolysis by the time they are examined by the pathologist. Blood may be noted at the nares and often pours forth from the nose when the carcass is shifted. The gross pathology of exercise-associated fatal pulmonary hemorrhage (EAFPH) consists of widespread hemorrhage and edema in both lungs (eFig. 5-28).

Further, the lung involvement in horses dying from EAFPH is much greater than for EIPH, which is mostly a disease of the caudodorsal lung. It is speculated that if, during exercise, horses developed sudden widespread spasm of small postcapillary venules within the lungs, this could lead to a rapid rise in capillary pressures that might be sufficient to cause widespread acute rupture and hemorrhage, as is seen in EAFPH. In rodents, there are smooth muscle sphincters in postcapillary veins that are capable of constricting and regulating local vascular perfusion and pressures through adrenergic receptors. If such structures are present in the equine lung, this might provide a mechanism for the sudden global edema and hemorrhage that occurs in EAFPH. This hypothesis remains to be tested.",

The bleeding in EIPH has been postulated to arise from rupture of the alveolar capillary bed as a result of the high vascular pressures achieved within the lung during strenuous exercise. However, the distribution and features of the gross and histologic pathology of EIPH are not explained by simple pressure-induced capillary rupture. The most recent data suggests that the cause of EIPH is regional venous remodeling. This remodeling likely occurs as a result of the high vascular pressures and flow experienced by veins in the caudodorsal lung. It is known that blood flow is preferentially distributed to the caudodorsal lung of horses at rest and increases further to this lung region during exercise, which could explain the regional distribution of the venous lesions in the EIPH lung. Further, data have shown that the other lesions in the EIPH lung, mainly reflect chronic remodeling of pulmonary arterioles. These include thickening of the tunica intima by endothelial cell proliferation and later by fibrosis, hypertrophy of smooth muscle in the tunica media, and more variable fibrosis or edema of the adventitia . Small arterioles at the level of the terminal airway that normally have a thin tunica muscularis may become muscularized. A range of morphologic variants in cases of PAH in humans are recognized: intimal proliferation that may be concentric (in familial PAH), eccentric (as a result of thromboembolism and other causes), or obliterative; thrombosis and recanalization of the lumen; and plexiform lesions. The latter are web-like plexuses of vascular lumens, each surrounded by concentric rings of endothelial cells and matrix, which appear as a branching or outpouching of a larger artery, and are thought to represent chronic attempts to repair damage to the parent vessel wall (Fig. 5-21) . Severe acute PAH results in endothelial degeneration, vasoconstriction, fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall, vasculitis, and \"onion skin\" fibrosis and proliferation of smooth muscle cells .",

In veterinary medicine, this is usually measured using echocardiography rather than direct catheterization of the right heart. Pulmonary hypertension is often classified by the underlying cause (Box 5-4). The pathogenesis of PAH historically had been considered to involve excessive vasoconstriction and thrombosis leading to vascular remodeling. PAH is now understood to be a vasculopathy, characterized by dysregulation of vascular tone, abnormal vascular cell growth, and apoptosis, along with inflammation. The vascular remodeling characteristic of PAH is a cause rather than a result of the disease. The dysregulation of vessel tone in PAH is caused by an imbalance in vasodilatory (e.g., prostacyclin, nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate) and vasocontricting (e.g., endothelin, thromboxane A 2 , serotonin) molecules, whereas a number of growth factors and cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b2, bone morphogenetic protein 2, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growth factors are implicated in the vascular lesions of PAH. Gross lesions in cases of primary idiopathic PAH are often not present within the lungs. In secondary PAH, the gross lesions reflect the precipitating disease, such as interstitial lung disease, canine heartworm disease, or pulmonary thromboembolism. Severe PAH leads to right ventricular and sometimes atrial dilation, and hypertrophy develops with time. Lesions of right heart failure may be present. Irrespective of the cause, PAH has a spectrum of characteristic histologic lesions that results from progressive remodeling of pulmonary veins.

Dogs with uremic pneumonopathy may have tachypnea and dyspnea. The magnitude of respiratory signs and lesions is not related to the severity of renal dysfunction nor to the clinical outcome. There are often no gross lesions, or the lung may be gritty and porous. Mineralization occurs within the smooth muscle and connective tissue fibers in alveolar septa, pulmonary veins, and the walls of bronchioles . Alveoli are edematous and contain increased numbers of macrophages, and giant cells occasionally engulf the mineralized material. Hemorrhage, thin strands of fibrin, and edema may be prominent in acute exacerbations (see . Alveolar septa and pulmonary veins, such as the gastric mucosa, may be predisposed to mineralization because of the alkaline microenvironment resulting from carbon dioxide excretion. Mineral deposits in the lung undergo ossification with time. Papillary adenomas are solitary circumscribed tumors of the bronchi or lung parenchyma, characterized by papillary growth of well-differentiated epithelial cells; these occur in dogs but are rare. Peribronchiolar metaplasia (Lambertosis) is a non-neoplastic condition thought to result from bronchiolar injury, which involves hyperplasia but not dysplasia of the terminal bronchiolar epithelium, and extension of club cells, goblet cells, or squamous cells into adjacent alveoli (eFig. 5-34). The bronchiolar origin of the alveolar cells can be confirmed by detection of specific cytokeratins. Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma in situ (see Table  5 -1) do not cause clinical disease in humans; its occurrence in dogs has not been defined. Minimally invasive, lepidicpredominant, and papillary predominant adenocarcinomas (see Table 5 are the most frequent lung tumors in dogs, forming pale moderately firm masses, usually arising in subpleural or peripheral areas of lung. Some neoplasms have accumulations of eosinophilic secretion within the lumen of the tumor, or mucus secretion is occasionally prominent. Minimally invasive and lepidic tumors in dogs are associated with prolonged survival, whereas papillary predominant tumors behave similarly but occasionally invade adjacent tissues or metastasize. In contrast, acinarpredominant or solid-predominant adenocarcinoma, although less frequent in dogs, carry a higher risk of invasive growth and metastasis. Micropapillary adenocarcinoma seems to occur as an aggressive neoplasm in dogs and cats but has not been formally described.",

            "text": "Primary pulmonary neoplasms are encountered most often in dogs and cats, and are rare in other domestic animals. A variety of mechanisms explains the clinical effects of lung tumors. Respiratory failure is rare but may ensue if tumors occupy a large proportion of lung parenchyma. More commonly, effects on specific anatomic structures explain the clinical signs: coughing caused by compression of a bronchus, pleural effusion and dyspnea caused by invasion of pleural lymphatics and regional lymph nodes, hemoptysis from erosion of blood vessels, or rarely regurgitation caused by esophageal obstruction. Other sequelae include cytokine production, leading to malaise, anorexia, and cachexia; the distant effects of metastasis; and paraneoplastic syndromes, including hypertrophic osteopathy, hypercalcemia, fever, or adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. Epithelial tumors are the most frequently encountered type. For primary epithelial lung tumors, hilar or central neoplasms are more likely of bronchial origin, whereas peripheral tumors, which are far more common, are more likely to have arisen from distal bronchiolar or alveolar epithelium. Because the lung is a frequent site for metastatic neoplasms, it is essential to differentiate metastases of a distant tumor from primary lung neoplasms. Features supporting the diagnosis of a primary lung neoplasm include the absence of a primary tumor in a distant organ, the presence of a single large lung mass with or without smaller metastases (eFig. 5-33), detection of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), or mucus production or ciliated cells (neither of which are commonly present even in primary tumors). Because pulmonary carcinomas often form intrapulmonary metastases, the presence of tumor emboli within vessels is not helpful in distinguishing primary from metastatic tumors. Expression of TTF-1 is detected in most (64-95%, depending on the study) primary pulmonary adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas, but is usually absent in pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma, mucinous pulmonary adenocarcinoma, mesothelioma, or nonpulmonary nonthyroid metastatic tumors. Thus peripheral neoplasms of bronchioloalveolar origin are generally TTF-1 positive, whereas central neoplasms arising from large airways are negative. Pulmonary adenocarcinomas are consistently labeled for pancytokeratins (AE1/AE3), and vimentin is co-expressed in the less-differentiated tumors.",

The lepidic pattern of growth is an important feature of several neoplasms described later, and is characterized by pre-existing alveoli whose septa are covered by a single layer of neoplastic epithelial cells that do not invade the connective tissue (see eFigs. 5-30, 5-35). Simple finger-like ingrowths may occur, but secondary or tertiary branching indicates a papillary rather than lepidic pattern. Identifying elastic fibers in the walls of alveoli (lepidic pattern) may be useful, as these are absent in papillae. The name lepidic refers to the resemblance to a row of butterflies perched on a branch. In addition to lepidic, other patterns of growth are papillary (see Fig.  5 -25B; see also eFig. 5-36), acinar, micropapillary, and solid. 3. Invasion does not refer to extension of neoplastic cells into lung tissue adjacent to the neoplasm, but instead indicates invasion of neoplastic cells into the tumor stroma (see Fig. 5 -35C, eFig. 5-37), blood or lymphatic vessels, or pleura. Invasion of stroma is recognized by areas of fibroblastic or myofibroblastic stroma (desmoplastic reaction) containing neoplastic cells. In addition, any papillary, acinar, micropapillary, or solid growth pattern is considered invasive growth. 4. Invasive adenocarcinomas often have more than one morphologic pattern in a single mass, and the classification is based on the predominant pattern across the entire tumor. It is recommended to state the percentage of the mass comprising each of the various patterns, in 5% increments.",

In humans, key elements of staging include the size of the mass, invasion along a bronchus (rare in animals), careful examination of pleural puckers to detect invasion through the elastic layer of the pleura or through the pleural surface, invasion across an interlobar fissure into a different lobe, formation of physically separate additional tumor nodules (only those recognized grossly, not incidental microscopic nodules) of the same histologic subtype in the same or different lobes, and lepidic, papillary, acinar, and adenosquamous patterns (see Box 5-5 and Table 5 -1).

Affected cats develop progressive dyspnea and coughing from the expansile tumor, or there may be intrapulmonary metastasis, or pleural invasion with effusion arising from the intrapleural metastases (eFig. 5-39).

Unlike true epithelial neoplasms, which have features consistent with their clonal origin, feline IPF is a heterogeneous lesion with evidence of smooth muscle proliferation, fibrosis, and honeycomb lung formation.

The consequence is failure of alveolar ventilation that may cause hypoxemia and hypercapnia. As a result of alveolar hypoxia inducing reflex vasoconstriction, there is reduced perfusion of hypoventilated areas of lung that, if widespread, may lead to pulmonary hypertension.

The etiology is rarely identified. Proposed causes include dry air; airborne pollutants, including sulfur dioxide and particulates; environmental tobacco smoke; chronic gingivitis with aspiration of debris; immune-mediated inflammation; and viral infection. Opportunistic bacterial pathogens are occasionally isolated, but their significance as a primary cause is questionable; similarly, viral and bacterial infections are well recognized to induce acute exacerbations in human patients with chronic bronchitis in which infection is not the primary cause.

In purulent bronchitis, the exudate is yellow or white and viscid. Fibrinonecrotic bronchitis resulting from viral or occasionally mycotic infection is characterized by areas of epithelial necrosis with loosely adherent fibrinous exudate.

Other cats have chronic rather than episodic coughing or wheezing; chronic bronchitis is a more accurate diagnosis in these cases if it cannot be demonstrated that the signs are readily reversible. Cats parenterally sensitized then challenged with Bermuda grass allergens develop allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), IgG, and IgA; airway hyper-reactivity; and the following histologic lesions in the bronchi: narrowing of the lumen, smooth muscle hypertrophy, infiltrates of eosinophils in the wall and lumen, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of goblet cells and bronchial glands, and hyperplasia and exfoliation of the surface epithelium. The histologic findings in natural cases are not as well characterized because mortality is uncommon. In addition to smooth muscle hyperplasia and eosinophil infiltration, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with lymphoid follicles may develop in the adventitia of the bronchi, and bronchioles may contain similar lesions. Chronic bronchitis in cats may be a manifestation of ongoing low-grade allergic reactions, although these do not fulfill the criteria of acute onset of reversible airway obstruction, as is necessary for the diagnosis of asthma.

Bronchiectasis is defined as permanent dilation of bronchi as a result of chronic bronchial obstruction and infection. Such bronchi become unable to clear the inflammatory exudate and will no longer perform their normal functions. Although most cases are a complication of bronchopneumonia or bacterial bronchitis, bronchiectasis may occur with immune-mediated bronchitis, or rarely as a congenital malformation. Bronchiectasis is relatively common in cattle with chronic bronchopneumonia, because complete lobular septation and lack of collateral ventilation both impair resolution of bronchopneumonia and lead to more extensive atelectasis because of airway blockage. Bronchiectasis is common in dogs. The lesions commonly affect the right cranial or middle lung lobes, and are usually the result of eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy, bacterial infection or occasionally tumors, bronchial foreign bodies, or ciliary dyskinesia. The condition in cats usually affects the caudal or middle lobes, and is often a sequel to chronic bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, or pulmonary neoplasia. Endogenous lipid pneumonia and emphysema are concurrent findings in some cases. Bronchiectasis infrequently develops in pigs, sheep, and goats with severe parasitic bronchitis.

Airway obstruction occurs more readily in bronchioles than in bronchi because their lack of cartilage rings and small luminal size readily permits collapse and occlusion by exudate. According to Poiseuille's law of frictional resistance, resistance to airflow varies with the fourth power of the radius, so narrowing of the airway by half will increase airway resistance 16-fold.

Complete airway obstruction causes atelectasis, whereas partial obstruction leads to air trapping and overdistension of alveoli (see Fig. 5 -17).

These structures contain hundreds of proteins, so it is not surprising that primary ciliary dyskinesia is a diverse collection of disorders involving mucuspropelling cilia in the nasal cavity and bronchi, sperm flagella, nodal cilia in the developing embryo, water-propelling cilia in the ependyma and epididymis, and cilia in the middle ear and retina. Primary ciliary dyskinesia, or immotile cilia syndrome, is an inherited condition reported infrequently in many dog breeds, which manifests as recurrent or persistent rhinitis and sinusitis, bronchiectasis, bacterial pneumonia, and/or male infertility caused by reduced spermatozoal motility with abnormal tails. About half of affected humans and dogs have Kartagener's syndrome, defined as the combination of sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus. The latter is a left-right reversal of the thoracic and/or abdominal viscera resulting from dysfunction of cilia in the embryologic node. Otitis media or hydrocephalus may occasionally be present.",

Autoimmune disorders, drug reactions, and reactions to mineral dusts are further causes of bronchiolar injury in humans. In addition, bronchiolar lesions are frequently an extension of bronchitis, bronchiectasis, or bacterial bronchopneumonia. The designation of bronchointerstitial pneumonia is appropriate when necrosis targets both the bronchiolar and the alveolar epithelium, as occurs particularly in viral infections and toxic injury (see Fig. 5 -30). Bronchiolar epithelial Lungs tests induce delayed rather than immediate reactions and do not correlate with airway reactivity, antigen-specific IgE levels are similar to controls, and stimulated bronchoalveolar lavage cells in horses with RAO produce both interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-\u03b3 (in addition to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8) mRNA, suggesting that a pure type 2 immune response is not characteristic of this disease. Alternatively, dysregulation of the normal anti-inflammatory functions of club cells may promote airway inflammation in affected horses. Challenge with molds, mold extracts, or endotoxincontaining dusts has induced airway neutrophilia and obstruction in heaves-susceptible but not normal horses, implying that all of these factors contribute to the airway responses. The disease occurs in stabled horses in northern regions and as a summer pasture-associated form in warm wet climates. Affected horses have chronic cough, increased expiratory effort, wheezing, variable nasal discharge, and exercise intolerance. Increased pulmonary resistance and reduced dynamic compliance are typical functional changes, and the bronchioles are hyper-responsive to agonists. The signs wax and wane depending on exposure to dusts, and a seasonal effect is common, but many cases are slowly progressive over the course of months or years.",

Aspiration pneumonia (described later) is an obvious situation where pulmonary challenge with massive numbers of bacteria overcomes the lung defenses. Similarly, in cattle, stress leads to increased numbers of Mannheimia haemolytica bacteria colonizing the nasal cavity, with increased numbers of bacteria in inhaled droplets challenging the lung defenses. The causes of impaired lung defenses include stress, viral and mycoplasmal infection, unadapted exposure to cold, toxic gases, and inherited conditions. Agents or conditions that impair mucociliary clearance include exposure to cold, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, a variety of toxic gases, and ciliary dyskinesia. Corticosteroids (stress) and bovine viral diarrhea virus dampen the ability of airway epithelial cells to produce antimicrobial peptides. Alveolar macrophage function is reduced by bovine herpesvirus 1, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, stress, aflatoxin, and T-2 mycotoxin. Conditions that reduce the number or function of circulating neutrophils may also predispose to opportunistic bacterial pneumonia, including parvoviral enteritis, acute bovine viral diarrhea virus infection, chemotherapy, stress, acidosis, uremia, and several mycotoxins. Bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD) is an autosomal recessive disease present in Holstein cattle. Neutrophils in affected animals have abnormal expression of the characteristic, whereas leukocyte infiltrates in the airway wall and smooth muscle hyperplasia are seen in horses without RAO. Lesions are more severe in the caudodorsal lung. Eosinophils are usually infrequent but numerous in some cases; their presence perhaps reflects a different stage of the disease. Mucus spills into the adjacent alveoli in severe cases. Overinflation of alveoli may result from trapping of air distal to the obstructed bronchioles, but true emphysema with destruction of alveolar septa is not expected. Inflammatory airway disease is a term used to describe an RAO-like condition in younger horses. It occurs in 2-to 4-year-old horses, causes no clinical signs at rest, but exercise induces excessive airway mucus production and coughing, leading to exercise intolerance and poor racing performance. Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology reveals mild neutrophilia in some cases, eosinophilia in others, and some with increased numbers of mast cells. The histologic features are not described.

If there is minimal damage to the alveolar septa and blood vessels, catarrhal or mild purulent bronchopneumonia can begin to resolve within 7-10 days and return to normal within 3-4 weeks. In ruminants and swine, the lack of collateral ventilation impedes clearance of alveolar exudates, and these species have a greater propensity to develop chronic suppurative bronchopneumonia.",

The characteristic pathologic finding is the presence of hyaline membranes, which are aggregates of fibrin, other serum proteins, and cell debris (see Fig.  5 -39B). These appear in alveoli and/or alveolar ducts as linear masses of discrete, densely eosinophilic material lining the junction between the airspace and the septum.

This contrasts with bronchitis and bronchiolitis, which involve the airways, and bronchopneumonia, which forms exudate in the airspaces of the alveoli and distal airways (see Fig. 5 -30). The terminology used to classify the interstitial lung diseases suffers from a lack of consensus in veterinary pathology. We use the term interstitial lung disease to define a broad range of conditions affecting or arising from the pulmonary interstitium. In addition to diffuse alveolar damage, other forms of interstitial lung disease in animals include granulomatous and eosinophilic pneumonia; mononuclear cell infiltrates targeting alveolar septa and vascular adventitia (e.g., porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, maedi, and metastrongylid nematode infections such as Muellerius and Aelurostrongylus), multifocal lesions dominated by necrosis (e.g., toxoplasmosis or canine herpesvirus infection) or epithelial proliferation and fibrosis (e.g., equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis), and most pneumoconioses. There are many histologic patterns of interstitial lung disease identified in humans, including diffuse alveolar damage, usual interstitial pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia; most of these have little relevance to diseases of domestic animals. The term \"interstitial pneumonia\" is used in 2 different ways in veterinary medicine: as a synonym for interstitial lung disease to describe a broad range of inflammatory (e.g., viral) or noninflammatory (e.g., toxic) diseases affecting the interstitium, or more narrowly to describe increased numbers of leukocytes, usually lymphocytes and macrophages, within the is initially observed at 2-3 days and is extensive by 6 days after insult. It is a dysfunctional stage of epithelial repair because these cuboidal cells block effective gas exchange. Type II pneumocytes are the major source of basement membrane if this structure has been previously damaged. If the injurious stimulus has been removed, then the type II cells differentiate into type I pneumocytes, and surplus cells undergo apoptosis. The cuboidal type II cells may no longer be visible histologically by 5-7 days after a single mild insult, but may remain for prolonged periods if the injurious stimulus persists or in the presence of interstitial fibrosis.

Usually, it denotes the presence of both bronchiolar necrosis and diffuse alveolar damage, and is thus a manifestation of injury to both the bronchiolar and the alveolar epithelium (see Fig. 5 -30). In this context, bronchointerstitial pneumonia can be caused by aerogenous viral infections or inhaled or ingested toxins that affect both of these cell types. Alternatively, bronchointerstitial pneumonia has been used to describe diseases in which mononuclear cells encircle airways and infiltrate alveolar septa, such as in Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections of swine or in mild or subacute viral infections. These patterns are not to be confused with bronchopneumonia, which in a sense is the opposite of bronchointerstitial pneumonia. In bronchopneumonia, bronchioles and alveoli are filled with leukocytes as a result of bacterial infection of the airspace, but necrosis of the bronchiolar or alveolar epithelium is not usually present. necrosis; this pattern of damage to bronchioles and alveoli represents bronchointerstitial pneumonia and is discussed later. Noninfectious causes of direct injury to type I pneumocytes include physical forces (as in surface tension in neonatal hyaline membrane disease, or ventilator-induced lung injury); thermal and chemical injury from inhalation of steam or smoke, as occurs in barn or house fires; acid-induced injury from aspiration of sterile vomitus in monogastric animals (associated with vomiting, anesthesia, or seizures); and inhalation of toxic gases, such as chlorine, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, phosgene gas, and high concentrations of oxygen. Other xenobiotics must be metabolized by type II pneumocytes to reactive intermediates that damage the alveolar epithelium. These include 3-methylindole, ipomeanol, perilla mint, Crofton weed, and chemotherapeutic nitrosourea, and are considered in the section Toxic lung injury.",

The most intuitive mechanism is overdistension of alveoli with damage to the septa, leading to interlobular emphysema, pneumomediastinum, or pneumothorax. Less obvious is the repetitive trauma suffered by alveoli and small bronchioles as they collapse at the end of expiration and are subjected to the high pressures required for reinflation. This mechanical strain and shear stress damages the type I pneumocytes and endothelial cells, and thus results in alveolar edema, formation of hyaline membranes, and infiltration of neutrophils in the alveoli or terminal bronchioles. Finally, ventilator-induced injury may result in neutrophil influx and increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the alveolar lining fluid, and this inflammatory response may be stimulated by abnormal stretch or strain pressures on macrophages or BOX \u2022 5-6 tic or anaphylactoid is a matter of debate. The onset of disease is typically 2-8 hours after vaccination, whereas IgE-mediated anaphylaxis usually occurs within 5-30 minutes. Histologic lesions include alveolar edema containing macrophages and neutrophils, congested alveolar septa with infiltrates of mononuclear cells and neutrophils, and periarterial hemorrhages. In diagnostic cases, additional testing may be necessary to distinguish anaphylaxis, sepsis, and other mechanisms of postvaccinal reaction. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in animals occurs mainly in adult cattle reared in confinement, and rarely in horses, and often affects multiple animals in the group. It results from chronic inhalation of spores of thermophilic actinomycetes (especially Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, formerly Micropolyspora faeni) in moldy hay, leading to inflammatory reactions that occur through several mechanisms concurrently. The bacteria directly activate complement by the alternative pathway, and there is solid evidence for immune-complex (type III) reactions, even though the morphology suggests a delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction.

The eosinophilic interstitial pneumonias are a compilation of pulmonary diseases united by the presence of eosinophils in the alveoli or alveolar septa. The best described are those caused by parasites, which are discussed more fully in later sections but include both adult parasites residing in the lung and migrating larva. Other conditions probably represent hypersensitivity reactions. Those primarily affecting the airways (including eosinophilic bronchopneumopathy) are discussed above. Eosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis is a rare condition in dogs, characterized by chronic cough, variable dyspnea, and blood eosinophilia. The lungs contain nodular necrotizing lesions formed by eosinophils, epithelioid macrophages, and fibrosis, with type II pneumocyte proliferation and eosinophil infiltrates in the surrounding alveoli. Many dogs with eosinophilic pulmonary granulomatosis have heartworm disease, although microfilariae are not detected in the granulomas. Less severe eosinophilic pneumonias are poorly described in dogs and cats, in part because the steroid responsiveness of many cases precludes their examination at autopsy. The alveoli contain eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, and the degree of fibrosis is variable. A similar condition occurs in be discovered as an incidental finding at autopsy or, when there is more extensive lung involvement, may result in chronic respiratory disease and debilitation. Grossly, DPF appears as multifocal and coalescing large foci of visceral pleural fibrosis (without parietal pleural fibrosis) over the dorsal lungs (eFig. 5-55). Histologically, there is pleural and subpleural fibrosis with subpleural intra-alveolar fibrosis and occasional foci of septal and peribronchiolar fibrosis, as well as arterial and venous intimal fibrosis. In the most severely affected regions, fibrosis extends to the ventral lung. Elastin staining of affected tissue reveals abundant elastin fibers within the regions of fibrosis and disruption of the normal pleural elastic fiber architecture. The pathology of DPF shares features with pleuroparenchymal pulmonary fibrosis in humans, a rare form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. The cause of DPF remains unknown. There is no evidence that the development of DPF is related to lung infection with asinine herpesviruses (AHV) as has been reported with AHV-4 and AHV-5 and the development of chronic interstitial pneumonia in donkeys (see Infectious respiratory diseases of horses, later). Interstitial lung disease in dogs. Diffuse alveolar damage manifesting clinically as acute respiratory distress syndrome is occasionally encountered in dogs of various ages. Affected animals develop acute onset of dyspnea with tachypnea, and variable coughing and lethargy, which is usually rapidly progressive and fatal within 3 days. Findings considered secondary to dyspnea include pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema, and gastroesophageal intussusception. At autopsy, the lungs are diffusely firm with a liver-like texture, edematous and heavy, and mottled (eFig. 5-56; see . Hyaline membranes are a nearly consistent feature and often affect alveolar ducts, with proliferation of type II pneumocytes in the less fulminant cases. Epithelial necrosis or attenuation is often present in terminal bronchioles. Diffuse alveolar damage may be considered to result from either direct injury to alveolar epithelium or as a result of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Specific inciting causes include massive trauma, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, septicemia, bacterial pneumonia in other areas of lung, aspiration of sterile gastric acid, smoke inhalation, oxygen toxicity, other toxins, viral infection, near drowning, and strangulation. Many cases are idiopathic. Similar findings, but localized, may be identified in lung lobes that have undergone torsion, or in areas of ischemia resulting from thromboembolism.",

The disease has been likened to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis) in humans. Lesions are often present throughout the lung, but tend to be patchy or multinodular rather than diffuse (eFig. 5-57). The histologic lesions include multifocal or irregular areas in which alveolar septa are remarkably thickened by smooth muscle, fibrosis, and focal clusters of fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts. Alveoli are lined by prominent cuboidal or columnar epithelial cells, which often contain mucus or occasionally undergo squamous metaplasia. There is variation in the relative prominence of the epithelial proliferation and matrix deposition . Interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes is a variable finding, and concurrent bronchioloalveolar carcinomas are identified in some affected cats. The cause of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in cats and humans is unknown. Emerging evidence in humans and animal models suggests that apoptosis of type II pneumocytes, resulting from shortened telomere length or from endoplasmic reticulum stress, leads to a failure to maintain and repair the alveolar epithelium. Subsequently, epithelial cell apoptosis is known to stimulate fibrosis in the underlying connective tissue. Thus dysregulation of type II pneumocyte survival and function is a possible mechanism for development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Williams K, et Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.

Familial forms of neonatal respiratory distress seem to occur but are not documented in domestic species. Interstitial lung disease caused by mutation of genes involved in surfactant function are described in humans and rodents, and their manifestations vary between genotypes and species: Deficiency of the phospholipid transporter ABCA3 causes lymphocytic interstitial infiltrates and alveolar proteinosis; SP-A deficiency is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or increased susceptibility to bacterial infection; SP-B mutations result in alveolar proteinosis, failure of formation of tubular myelin, and/or diffuse alveolar damage; SP-C mutations in humans cause fibrosis of the alveolar septa with infiltration of mononuclear cells, similar to that seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; and SP-D-deficient mice develop alveolar lipidosis with type II pneumocyte proliferation. A familial form of neonatal respiratory distress is described in pigs, and may result from pulmonary dysmaturity caused by congenital hypothyroidism. Affected piglets have diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes and bronchiolar necrosis, and features suggesting hypothyroidism, including mildly prolonged gestation, fine hair coat, generalized edema, and thyroid follicular hyperplasia with lack of colloid. Lopez Lipid pneumonia and alveolar filling disorders. Lipid pneumonia is a special form of aspiration pneumonia in which droplets of oil are aspirated into the lung. Spectacular flooding of the lungs occurs when mineral oil is drenched through a stomach tube accidentally placed into the lung, or lesser amounts are aspirated if the oil is carelessly given per os. Oily droplets are noticed in the trachea and bronchi, or when sections of lung are immersed in formalin (eFig. 5-60). The reaction is typically dominated by macrophages, but the appearance depends on the nature of the oil. In general, vegetable oils such as olive oil are not irritating and eventually resorbed with little reaction or fibrosis. Oils of animal origin are irritants and provoke early exudation of serofibrinous fluid and leukocytes. This is later replaced by foamy macrophages and giant cells that fill the alveoli; the alveolar septa are thickened by mononuclear cells and fibrosis. The oil is ultimately resorbed. The purest cellular response occurs to mineral oil, which is the usual offender in animals. Mineral oil can be identified by its permanence and by its failure to stain with osmic acid. The alveolar lipid is both extracellular and intracellular within macrophages. In time, lipid-laden macrophages accumulate in peribronchial and interlobular septal lymphatics, and there is fibrosis of these tissues and of alveolar septa. Pneumonias causes include equid herpesvirus 1, septicemia, hyaline membrane disease, and meconium aspiration. Other causes of respiratory disease in neonates include bronchopneumonia secondary to placentitis or aspiration of ingesta, and persistent pulmonary hypertension. The biology of pulmonary surfactant (see Cellular architecture and cell biology of the lung, previously) is central to the pathogenesis of hyaline membrane disease.",

Acute pulmonary injury caused by smoke inhalation is seen in animals trapped in burning buildings (see Fig. 5-14) .

Pneumoconiosis-lung disease ensuing from inhalation and retention of inorganic dusts-is uncommon in animals because they lack occupational exposures that are the basis for most human cases. In general, inorganic dusts are engulfed by and persist within macrophages, which secrete mediators that induce the characteristic fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation. Mild pulmonary anthracosis is a common incidental finding in city-dwelling animals or those cohabiting with cigarette smokers, in which carbon particles accrue within macrophages adjacent to airway bifurcations, including the wall of terminal bronchioles. Asbestosis is characterized by asbestos (ferruginous) bodies-asbestos fibers coated with ferritin and hemosiderin that are linear with a beaded appearance and globose ends-within granulomatous and fibrosing lung lesions.

Silicates, on the other hand, are common crustal minerals formed when SiO 2 combines with a variety of cations, especially magnesium, calcium, and aluminum. Asbestos is a fibrous silicate whose inhalation may result in asbestosis (described previously), whereas nonasbestos silicate pneumoconioses refers to disease associated with inhalation of a variety of non-asbestos, that is, nonfibrous, silicates. The clinical signs associated with silicate pneumoconiosis in horses include weight loss, exercise intolerance, and dyspnea, and the condition in horses has been associated with osteoporosis. Miliary firm or gritty lesions are distributed throughout the lung. Microscopically, the lesions are mainly centered on bronchioles or, less frequently, target the interlobular septa and consist of multifocal fibrosis with granulomatous inflammation, often with necrosis and mineralization in the centers. Clear, brown, or black crystals are indistinctly visible in the cytoplasm of the macrophages. These are sometimes birefringent, can usually be highlighted by acid-fast stains, and are identified by X-ray spectroscopy. Although the cause of this severe pulmonary disease is reported to be the result of inhalation of silicate particles, based on finding such particles associated with the characteristic granulomatous inflammation, no studies have been performed to confirm the pathogenicity of silicates in horses. Histologically, silicates are commonly detected in the lungs of many species as an incidental finding unrelated to progressive fibrosing lung disease, and pulmonary lesions similar to silicate pneumoconiosis have congestion, emphysema, and rarely eosinophil infiltration, but not hyaline membranes; and extrinsic allergic alveolitis, in which lymphocytes and granulomas form beside bronchioles and within alveolar septa.

The CYP isozymes have a species-dependent distribution in nasal tissue, club cells, type II pneumocytes, and to a lesser extent in ciliated epithelial cells, type I pneumocytes, endothelial cells, and pulmonary macrophages. Reactive intermediates generated by CYP isozymes are further detoxified by phase II enzymes, including glutathione-S-transferases and glucuronyltransferases, to form water-soluble metabolites that are excreted. However, toxicity may develop when the phase II systems are inadequate (e.g., when glutathione is depleted or glutathione-S-transferase activity is impaired or absent) or overwhelmed by high concentrations of the reactive metabolite. In these situations, the electrophilic metabolite binds to essential proteins or nucleic acids, or leads to formation of oxygen radicals that damage cell membrane lipids. Thus the cellular susceptibility to toxic injury depends not only on cellspecific expression of the appropriate cytochrome P450 isozymes, but also on the adequacy of the antioxidants (glutathione, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase, and others) and phase II enzymes that protect the cell from injury.

The early ultrastructural changes are necrosis of nonciliated and ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells and type I pneumocytes, and transient swelling of endothelial cells. Although type II pneumocytes have high CYP activity, the high levels of glutathione and phase II enzymes are thought to spare these cells from injury.",

Affected animals have acute onset of dyspnea with expiratory effort, tachypnea, open-mouth breathing, and froth in the mouth. The trachea is filled with foam, and the lungs contain striking alveolar and interlobular edema, resulting in heavy wet lungs that fail to collapse. Interlobular or bullous emphysema is prominent in the caudal lobes in less fulminant cases (see Fig. 5-41) . Histologically, hyaline membranes line the edematous alveoli and alveolar ducts, and type II pneumocyte proliferation is extensive in the subacute stages. The alveolar septa are distended by edema, and may contain eosinophils and/or neutrophils in natural cases. Although bronchiolar lesions are often absent in natural cases, bronchiolar necrosis is described following intentional administration of 3-MI. The differential diagnoses for this histologic picture includes other toxins listed later as well as post-patent forms of Dictyocaulus viviparus infection, for which the histologic lesions are very similar, but recent access to lush pasture would favor fog fever; acute infection with Ascaris suum or Dictyocaulus larvae, which generally occur in younger calves and have many eosinophils with at least a few histologically visible larvae; viral pneumonia, which may be difficult to distinguish without laboratory testing unless viral syncytia or inclusion bodies are present; anaphylaxis, which causes pulmonary edema, erode through the pleura to cause empyema, through blood vessels and into airways to cause massive blood loss, or into a bronchus to cause suppurative bronchopneumonia.",

In normal animals at the time of autopsy, the diaphragm billows caudally with an in-rush of air reflecting the loss of negative intrathoracic pressure when the diaphragm is pierced; these features are absent in cases of pneumothorax (but may also be lost with significant autolysis of the body). In small animals, where detection of this diaphragmatic movement and in-rush of air in normal animals may be challenging, pneumothorax could be detected by opening the chest under water and observing the escape of air bubbles. Pneumothorax results in atelectasis, but in chronic cases, there may also be hyperplasia or metaplasia of the pleural mesothelium as well as type II pneumocyte proliferation in the adjacent alveoli. Pneumothorax can be spontaneous or traumatic. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax refers to rupture of blebs or bullae in the absence of apparent lung disease. Blebs and bullae are common causes of pneumothorax in dogs (see section Pulmonary emphysema, previously). Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax refers to those cases resulting from an underlying lung disease. The causes include rupture of lesions that form a communication between the airway and pleural space, such as parasitic cysts (e.g., paragonimiasis), abscesses, pyogranulomas, neoplasms, migrating foreign bodies, or infarcts. Other causes lead to emphysematous bulla formation: barotrauma (from forced ventilation during anesthesia), bronchopneumonia, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and thromboembolism. Traumatic pneumothorax is usually the result of accidental puncture of the thoracic wall and/or visceral pleura. Traumatic pneumothorax can also be a complication of cardiac resuscitation or biopsy of the lung.

These differences in virulence have not been shown to correlate with simple alterations in specific genes; rather, the virulence of particular strains is apparently determined by a combined effect of many genetic differences. Highly virulent strains have been associated with greater replication of virus within tissues; higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-\u03b3 (which may lead to systemic disease resulting from \"macrophage activation syndrome\"); more severe lesions within tissues; and greater susceptibility to septicemia from secondary bacterial pathogens.",

Distinguishing mesothelial hyperplasia from mesothelioma can be a diagnostic challenge. The latter is expected to fully invade collagenous connective tissue within the pleura and usually extends into underlying lung tissue along interlobular or alveolar septa. In contrast, in humans, features suggesting a reactive lesion include abundant pleural fibrin, multinucleated mesothelial cells in the fibrin, capillaries growing perpendicular to the pleural surface into the fibrin, and parallel rather than storiform arrangement of collagen. Immunohistochemical detection of both vimentin and cytokeratin, and detection of acid mucins by Alcian blue stain, are useful in distinguishing mesothelioma from other epithelial or nonepithelial neoplasms. However, pulmonary adenocarcinomas also frequently co-express cytokeratin and vimentin; positive thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) labeling may be useful for differentiation from epithelioid mesothelioma.

This finding is of clinical importance, as control of M. hyopneumoniae is one strategy for minimizing the effect of PRRSV in endemically infected herds. The effect of PRRSV infection on immune responses to other pathogens has not been fully addressed, but a state of generalized immunosuppression is not a likely feature of PRRS. Animals infected with PRRSV develop apoptosis of alveolar and pulmonary intravascular macrophages, and of mononuclear cells in alveolar septa. Because apoptotic cells are more numerous than virus-infected cells, the mechanism of apoptosis may not represent a direct effect of viral infection.

Since its original identification in 2004, PCV-2b has become the predominant genogroup, but the associated spectrum of lesions appears comparable among the 3 genogroups.",

Serum antibody to PCV-2 is widespread in swine herds, and PCV-2 infection is common in herds with no clinical evidence of PMWS. PMWS usually progresses slowly within the herd, with most cases developing in 5-to 12-week-old pigs. Morbidity is typically 5-10% but may be up to 20%, and most affected animals die or are euthanized. Pigs with PMWS lose weight or gain poorly, and have a variable combination of tachypnea, respiratory distress, diarrhea, pallor, and jaundice.

However, coinfection with PCV-2 and other pathogens, including parvovirus or PRRSV, results in more severe disease. Immunostimulation itself, either as a consequence of viral infection or vaccination, precipitates more severe disease. Thus activation of the immune response may encourage replication of PCV-2, resulting in more severe manifestations of PMWS. The role of PCV-2 in other swine diseases, termed PCV-associated diseases (PCVAD), remains controversial, in part because the virus can be isolated from many healthy pigs. In particular, although many pigs with dermatitis-nephropathy syndrome, proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia, sow abortion and mortality syndrome, congenital hypomyelination, and abortion with fetal myocarditis have evidence of PCV-2 infection, definitive proof of their causal association is lacking.",

Differential diagnoses for bronchiolar necrosis include porcine circovirus 2 infection, proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia, pseudorabies, Nipah virus infection, and airway injury caused by inhaled toxic gases. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR testing of fresh lung tissue, antigen-detection ELISA on nasal or bronchial swabs, or immunohistochemistry on fixed tissues using monoclonal antibodies to conserved type A nucleoproteins. Initial PCR testing can target the conserved matrix gene, followed by subtype-specific testing or sequencing of the hemagglutinin gene. Virus isolation using embryonated eggs or cell lines is advantageous for subtyping, characterization of isolates, and partial sequencing to compare current and past isolates in a herd. Sample selection is critical for the diagnosis of swine influenza. Viral titers are highest 24 hours after infection, before gross lesions are obvious, and virus often cannot be identified by 72 hours after infection. Consequently, selecting tissue from the cranioventral areas of the lung, from pigs early in the course of the disease, is critical for both histologic and virologic diagnosis. Pigs with a high fever are the most suitable subjects for diagnostic investigation. The transient nature of the infection may complicate an investigation of the role of swine influenza in herds with endemic respiratory disease. In these cases, herd-level serology may be useful.

Immunity to respiratory pathogens is dependent on patterns of pig flow through production units, vaccination practices, and alterations in innate resistance caused by social and environmental stresses, nutrition, and management practices. Against this background of host and environmental factors, interactions between multiple pathogens are commonly identified in swine pneumonia.

The cell membranes of many mycoplasmas, presumably including M. hyopneumoniae, contain superantigens that induce polyclonal proliferation of lymphocytes and result in the characteristic aggregates of lymphocytes around airways and blood vessels. Infection with M. hyopneumoniae is mainly transmitted by direct contact with nasal secretions from infected pigs, although aerosol transmission over short distances may occur. A common clinical scenario involves infection of a few young pigs by contact with an infected sow, followed by slow spread neutrophils, and granulomatous infiltrates in lymph nodes suggest PCV-2 infection. Establishing a definitive diagnosis in swine herds with pneumonia often requires laboratory support. M. hyopneumoniae is fastidious in its growth requirements, and isolation in culture is not a useful method of diagnosis. More sensitive confirmation of a morphologic diagnosis can be obtained by identifying antigen in lesional lung tissue by immunohistochemistry, or detection of M. hyopneumoniae DNA by PCR using lung tissue, nasal swabs, or transtracheal washes. Detection of serum antibody by ELISA is a useful method of confirming prior exposure, or validating the M. hyopneumoniae-free status of minimal-disease herds. Kwon D, et ",

Clinical disease caused by Pneumocystis is thought to be unlikely without underlying immunosuppression; identified causes include corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy; severe combined immunodeficiency in foals, sometimes in association with adenovirus or Rhodococcus infection; common variable immunodeficiency of Miniature Dachshunds, demodicosis, or canine distemper in dogs; and perhaps PRRSV or PCV-2 infection in pigs.

The life cycle is based only on morphologic evaluation, but involves a 1-4 \u00b5m diameter, thin-walled, uninucleate, trophic form that replicates by binary fission; and a 5-8 \u00b5m diameter, thick-walled, multinucleate cyst form that develops 8 intracystic bodies, which may be daughter forms that are products of sexual replication. The latter are released, attach to type I pneumocytes, and presumably develop into trophic forms. The cell wall is composed of mannose-rich polysaccharides and the major surface glycoprotein. This glycoprotein A is the immunodominant antigen and mediates binding of Pneumocystis to type I pneumocytes and macrophages, surfactant proteins, and fibronectin. Both macrophages and cell-mediated immune responses are essential 3-5 weeks of age. In the first week after experimental infection, neutrophils are present in airway lumens and, to a lesser extent, in alveoli. The numbers of neutrophils diminish and lymphoid cells increase over the subsequent several weeks to reach the fully developed stage of consolidation.

Because the intermediate host is the earthworm, pulmonary metastrongylosis is now rare in housed swine, but it is common in wild boar. They are believed to be responsible for the occasional transmission of influenza A virus. The adult worms are white, threadlike, and 14-60 mm in length . In heavy infections, which are mostly in young pigs, they may be found in all lobes of the lung. When there are fewer worms, particularly as occurs in older animals, the worms may be restricted to airways along the caudoventral borders of the caudal lobes. In histologic sections, the adults have polymyarian-coelomyarian musculature, cuboidal multinucleated intestinal epithelium with an indistinct microvillus layer, and thick-shelled eggs or embryonated eggs in the uterus (see eFigs. 5-77, 5-78). Eggs are laid in the bronchi, and a few of them hatch there, but most hatch after passing to the exterior in the feces. First-stage larvae are inactive and are capable of prolonged survival in moist conditions. Their further development depends on ingestion by earthworms, which are the intermediate hosts. The larvae develop to the third, infective stage in about 10 days, and then remain quiescent unless the earthworm is eaten by a pig. The larvae may survive for as long as 18 months in the earthworms and, by that time, thousands may be accumulated by a single worm. Migration within the pig is through the lymphatics from the intestine to the lungs. Some larvae pass through the liver and produce focal hepatitis. Even with heavy adult infestations, gross lesions are inconspicuous. The worms live in the smallest airways, and on superficial examination of the lungs, the presence of the parasites is frequently only indicated by gray-pink nodules l-3 mm in diameter and by hyperinflated lobules along the caudoventral margins of the caudal lobes. Histologically, the lesions are similar to those produced by Dictyocaulus spp. The initial lesions are multiple foci of intense accumulations of eosinophils surrounding larvae in alveoli. Subsequently, when reproduction is active, an eosinophilic and granulomatous response occurs to the eggs and larvae in the alveoli. The prepatent period for Metastrongylus spp. is about 25 days, after which the rate of egg production rapidly reaches a peak and then subsides to a low level. At this later stage, the adults persist mainly in the bronchioles, and small bronchi and provoke goblet cell hyperplasia and exudation of mucus, eosinophils, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells. The bronchiolar epithelium is mildly hyperplastic, and eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells permeate the lamina propria.",

Viral glycoproteins often form peplomers that project from the surface of the envelope; in addition to being key targets of protective immune responses, these envelope glycoproteins mediate viral entry into target cells, cellular fusion to form syncytia, and spread of virus between cells without exposure to extracellular antibody. Some envelope glycoproteins act as complement C3b or immunoglobulin Fc receptors, and several herpesviruses encode chemokine or chemokine receptor homologues that modulate the immunoinflammatory response.

The virus grows readily in cell culture and produces characteristic cytopathic effects. Thus virus isolation from nasal swabs, nasal mucosa, trachea, or lung is an excellent means of definitive diagnosis, and has the advantage that novel strains may be identified and archived. PCR tests and immunohistochemistry are advantageous when a rapid diagnosis is needed. An important caveat is warranted when identifying BoHV-1 infection in the absence of characteristic lesions. Cattle with other diseases experience stress-induced reactivation of latent herpesviral infections, leading to identification of the reactivated virus in any of these diagnostic assays. Samples should be obtained early in the course of disease, as antibody in the exudate of subacute lesions may preclude isolation of the virus and block antigen-antibody interactions in antigenbased assays.

The cranioventral lung is atelectatic, deep red or mottled, and rubbery ( Fig. 5-55 ). In contrast, the caudodorsal areas are voluminous because they fail to collapse, and are edematous, heavy, and firmer than normal. Variations in these gross lesions occur commonly: First, occasional cases have a generalized rubbery texture and red discoloration, with no difference between cranial and caudal lung; second, calves that die in respiratory distress may develop marked subpleural and interlobular emphysema with formation of bullae; and third, the raised, consolidated, firm to hard lesions of bronchopneumonia may obscure the aforementioned viral lesions in cases with secondary bacterial infection. Apart from hypertrophy and edema of bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes, lesions in other organs are usually not noted. Chronic cases of viral pneumonia with bronchiolitis obliterans, including those caused by BRSV, may die of heart failure caused by pulmonary Bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is common in North American and European beef and dairy herds. Seroprevalence studies suggest that about half of range calves in North America are exposed to BRSV, and most non-exposed calves seroconvert within a month of entering feedlots. The seroprevalence of BRSV in adult cattle varies from 40-95%. BRSV is an important cause of both acute outbreaks of respiratory disease and \"enzootic pneumonia\" in 2-week-old to 5-monthold dairy and beef calves, with a peak incidence at 1-3 months of age. BRSV certainly causes fatal bronchointerstitial pneumonia soon after arrival in beef feedlots, but rarely causes acute interstitial lung disease in the late feeding period. Finally, BRSV predisposes to bacterial pneumonia in feedlot beef cattle by impairing lung defenses, and occasionally causes respiratory disease in naive adult dairy cows.",

Lipopolysaccharide from M. haemolytica stimulates alveolar macrophages to secrete inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and the chemokines IL-8, epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide (ENA), and growth-regulated oncogene-\u03b1 (GRO-\u03b1). Other effects of M. haemolytica lipopolysaccharide on alveolar macrophages include triggering of oxidative burst, an important bactericidal mechanism that may also lead to oxidative tissue injury; expression of tissue factor, a mediator of the thrombosis characteristic of the disease; and secretion of nitric oxide, which may augment lung defenses but is also a potent mediator of vasodilation and hypotension. Other effects of lipopolysaccharide include activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, and complement activation. The mannose-rich polysaccharide capsule confers resistance of M. haemolytica to phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils, and may also block complement-dependent killing. Neuraminidase enhances adhesion of bacteria to mucosal epithelium by cleaving sialic acid from the surface of epithelial cells, and may reduce mucus viscosity to prevent mucociliary clearance.",

            "text": "Low numbers of M. haemolytica colonize the nasopharynx of normal calves, and there are several potential explanations for the shift from a commensal to a pathogenic relationship. First, stress or exposure to cold results in greater numbers of nasopharyngeal bacteria, so inhalation of droplets containing increased numbers of bacteria may overwhelm pulmonary defenses. The mechanisms whereby stress or exposure to cold induces expansion of the bacterial population, and whether these factors also alter expression of bacterial virulence factors, have not been defined. Second, some studies indicate that stress and cold exposure induce a shift from serotype 2 to the more pathogenic serotype 1. Third, viral infections or stress impair lung defenses. The lung is normally exposed to low numbers of aspirated M. haemolytica, but a combination of mucociliary clearance, antimicrobial function of secreted mucosal proteins, and phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages controls this infection without inciting an inflammatory response. Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 infect ciliated epithelium and reduce mucociliary clearance, and BoHV-1 and BRSV infect and impair the function of alveolar macrophages. In addition, BoHV-1 infection upregulates CD18 on the surface of bovine neutrophils, which, because CD18 is a receptor of M. haemolytica leukotoxin, makes these cells more susceptible to the leukotoxin. Viral infections may also impair secretion of antimicrobial proteins to a feedlot. Affected animals exhibit acute onset of depression, pyrexia, anorexia, rapid and shallow respiration, and mucopurulent nasal discharge. Coughing is variably present, and dyspnea develops in later stages. Most cattle respond rapidly to appropriate antibiotic therapy if given early in the course of disease, but relapses are common. Most reports of shipping fever describe 15-45% morbidity, 1-5% mortality, and case fatality rates of 5-10%, depending on the rapidity with which treatment is initiated. Risk factors for shipping fever include those associated with (1) increased exposure of naive calves to animals shedding viral pathogens, such as mixing of calves from various sources; (2) stress, such as weaning, transport, crowding, disruption of social groups, deprivation of feed and water, handling, vaccination, dehorning, and pregnancy checking; (3) metabolic acidosis, such as rapid introduction to grain or corn silage; and (4) exposure of calves to adverse environmental conditions, such as changes in temperature and humidity, cool weather in the autumn months, snow or rain, or dusty environment.",

The importance of H. somni as a cause of bovine pneumonia varies considerably between geographic regions. As with M. haemolytica, this pathogen uses a broad array of virulence factors. Resistance to serum-and complement-mediated killing is mediated by proteins that bind the Fc component of immunoglobulin, making these Fc receptors unavailable for complement activation. Lipo-oligosaccharide has many proinflammatory effects, analogous to lipopolysaccharide in other gram-negative bacteria. The lipo-oligosaccharide of diseaseassociated, but not commensal, isolates of H. somni undergoes structural and antigenic variation during the course of an experimental infection, and this variation may serve as a mechanism of immune evasion and resistance to complementmediated killing. Transferrin-and hemoglobin-binding proteins enable the bacteria to acquire iron for growth. H. somni binds to and induces apoptosis in endothelial cells in vitro, and although this effect may contribute to the vasculitis that is characteristic of H. somni septicemia, these processes are as yet poorly characterized. Immune-complex deposition is apparently not the cause of vasculitis. H. somni is considered a facultative intracellular pathogen as it survives within monocytes, yet both intracellular and extracellular bacteria are numerous in acute pneumonia, and biofilm formation is described. Finally, H. somni impairs the phagocytic function of neutrophils and macrophages, and induces degeneration of macrophages and apoptosis of neutrophils. Vasculitis in H. somni infection occurs by diverse mechanisms, including induction of an inflammatory response, apoptosis of endothelial cells, activation of platelets, and histamine production by the bacteria.",

Lesions are most severe in the cranial and middle lung lobes, but may also affect the caudal lung. Acute fulminant cases often exhibit lobar fibrinous pneumonia and pleuritis and may die with as little as 30% of the lung affected, because of systemic effects of the infection rather than failure of lung function. Lesions are often sharply demarcated from less affected areas of lung, are by airway or alveolar epithelium. The mechanisms whereby stress impairs innate pulmonary defenses are poorly defined. As a result of one or more of these processes, exposure of the lung to increased numbers of virulent M. haemolytica coincides with a reduction in pulmonary defenses, leading to increased colonization of the cranial lung lobes. The finding that outbreaks are often polymicrobial (with isolates of multiple Pasteurellaceae bacteria, including diverse genotypes of M. haemolytica) supports the notion that this disease results from failure of lung defenses, with colonization by opportunistic pathogens that are well equipped to evade the remaining defenses and incite disease.",

Massive exudation of fibrin into alveoli is a prominent feature of severe pneumonia in cattle, and is mediated in part by a direct effect of lipopolysaccharide on endothelial cells, but also by macrophage-derived inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-\u03b1. Phagocytosis of M. haemolytica by alveolar macrophages is limited unless the bacteria are opsonized by antibody or complement; the significance of other opsonins, such as the collectins, remains speculative. Alveolar macrophages that have ingested M. haemolytica or been exposed to bacterial products secrete an array of neutrophil chemoattractants, including IL-8, ENA, GRO, platelet-activating factor, and leukotriene B 4 . Neutrophils migrate to the alveoli and terminal bronchioles within 3 hours of experimental challenge with M. haemolytica. Neutrophil migration to alveoli uses a \u03b2 2 integrin-independent mechanism, whereas neutrophil recruitment to airways is dependent on interactions between \u03b2 2 integrin and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ICAM-1. In contrast to most bacterial infections, in which neutrophils phagocytose and kill the offending bacteria, neutrophils recruited to the sites of established infection with M. haemolytica are probably lysed by the effects of leukotoxin. Thus this disease is characterized by massive recruitment of neutrophils that are ineffective in killing bacteria, but nonetheless exacerbate the severity of clinical disease. Infiltration of neutrophils and additional macrophages into alveoli is harmful in several ways. The physical presence of these cells precludes normal ventilation and gas exchange; oxygen radicals, nitric oxide derivatives, and proteinases secreted by leukocytes may injure pulmonary cells and the interstitial stroma; expression of tissue factor by activated alveolar or intravascular macrophages promotes fibrin formation in the alveolus and thrombosis of blood vessels in the alveolar septa; and both macrophages and neutrophils secrete chemoattractants that perpetuate the recruitment of additional leukocytes.",

Immunosuppressed individuals, such as those with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), are at particular risk. Ingestion of milk from cows with mammary tuberculosis is a major route of infection in humans, typically inducing cervical lymphadenitis or other nonpulmonary forms of disease. This pattern of disease is of great historical importance as the impetus for identification of the tubercle bacillus and the subsequent pasteurization of milk, but infection from raw milk continues to occur in regions where bovine tuberculosis is common. Transmission from cattle to humans by aerosol or by contamination of cutaneous wounds also occurs, mainly in those in close contact with infected cattle. \u2022 Mycobacteria are nonmotile, nonspore-forming pleomorphic coccobacilli. They are gram-positive but almost unstainable by the simpler bacterial stains because of their high content of lipids.

This property of acid-fastness of the stained bacilli depends on the amount and spatial arrangement of mycolic acids and their esters in the bacterial wall. They are also demonstrable by fluorescent dyes such as auramine. Sometimes, in cultures or in old lesions, the organisms have a beaded or granulated appearance.

Larger lesions may contain liquefied or suppurative exudate and be mistaken for abscesses caused by pyogenic bacteria. initial innate immune response develops at this site of primary infection, as macrophages secrete cytokines-particularly tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and the C-C chemokinesthat recruit additional macrophages and lymphocytes to the site.

The airway mucosa contains infiltrates of eosinophils and mononuclear cells, the epithelium is necrotic or hyperplastic and contains increased numbers of goblet cells, and the peribronchial lymphoid tissue is expanded (eFig. 5-87). The accompanying alveolar lesions consist of atelectasis secondary to the obstructive bronchiolitis, and macrophages, giant cells, and lymphocytes encircling fragments of cuticle, aspirated eggs, or newly hatched larvae. It is complicated in some cases by bacterial bronchopneumonia. Alveolar septa are thickened by cellular infiltration, slight fibroplasia, and inconsistent proliferation of type II pneumocytes. At this stage, the infection may be diagnosed by gross observation of adult worms in the bronchi, examination of histologic sections of bronchi and alveoli, identification of all stages in wet mounts of airway mucus, identifying larvae in feces by the Baermann technique, and/or detection of antibodies in serum or milk by ELISA.",

First-stage larvae are expelled from the lung by coughing, are swallowed, and then passed in the feces. Further development to infective third-stage larvae occurs on the ground over the next 5-7 days. Larval development is optimal in moist cool conditions; the larvae can develop at temperatures as low as 5\u00b0 C, and their viability is prolonged at these temperatures. The third-stage larvae are ingested by cattle, penetrate the wall of the intestine, and migrate via the lymphatics to the mesenteric lymph nodes. In the lymph nodes, they molt to form fourth-stage larvae, and then go by way of lymph and blood to enter the lungs about 7 days after infection. Some larvae accidentally take the portal route and are destroyed in the liver, or rarely enter the systemic circulation to cause intrauterine infections in the fetus. The final molt to the fifth-stage larvae occurs in the bronchioles, and adults develop in the larger airways. Eggs are first detectable in feces at 21-30 days after infection; the infection is usually patent for another 1-3 months. However, a few egg-laying adults may persist in some animals over the winter months, and serve as a source of pasture contamination in the following grazing season.",

Mucosal dendritic cells are thought to deliver virus to lymph nodes, where the mannose receptor is the likely route of entry into macrophages. Ovine lentivirus infects a variety of cell types, including choroid plexus and mammary epithelium, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and monocytes. However, viral replication is restricted in these cells, and complete viral replication and assembly occur in mature macrophages. Viral antigen is widespread, having been detected in lung, bone marrow, mammary gland, lymph node, spleen, synovium, brain, and spinal cord of sheep with maedi, and is most abundant in areas of lymphocytic inflammation. Similarly, viral nucleic acid is demonstrable in lung, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, brain, synovium, intestine, kidney, and thyroid gland of goats with CAE. Infected alveolar macrophages produce cytokines that recruit and activate leukocytes in the area of infection, and may also incite fibrosis and smooth muscle metaplasia.

False-negative serologic tests can result from the delayed development of antibodies after infection, or transient periods of seronegativity. Quantitative PCR assays to detect proviral DNA or viral RNA in blood mononuclear cells or lung tissue may be positive earlier in the disease course than serologic assays. PCR assays are considered less sensitive than serology, but may be positive before development of an antibody titer.

In those that do, the typical incubation period has been estimated to be 2 years, but is age and dose dependent; tumors may develop in 10-20 days if high doses are administered experimentally to neonatal lambs. The increased propensity for tumor development in neonatally infected lambs may relate to the greater frequency of proliferating type II pneumocytes during postnatal lung development. In contrast, lung cells from adult sheep or goat kids are restrictive for JRSV replication. Disease is more common in certain breeds of sheep, but the reasons for this familial predisposition are unknown. The envelope glycoprotein is sufficient to induce similar tumors in immunodeficient mice, and is the likely mechanism of tumor formation in sheep. It is exceptional that a retroviral structural protein should induce neoplasia, but oncogenes have not been identified in JSRV.

Histologically, the nodules are composed of abundant interstitial collagen accumulation, along with irregular alveolus-like spaces lined by cuboidal epithelial cells. Within the lumen of these spaces, there is a moderate inflammatory infiltrate of mostly neutrophils and macrophages.

Both viruses readily infect nasal respiratory epithelial cells, causing local epithelial necrosis and inflammation that result in the aforementioned clinical signs. Less commonly, viral infection extends into the trachea, resulting in coughing in affected horses. Infection is rarely fatal, unless secondary bacterial pneumonia develops. Viral replication occurs in the nasopharynx and associated lymphoid tissue, and the development of viremia is dependent on the strain of the virus and prior exposure of the host. Virus is shed from nasal secretions starting 2-10 days after infection. Viral shedding commonly occurs only during the phase of pyrexia, but is occasionally prolonged up to 3 weeks after infection. Latency for EHV-1 and EHV-4 is established within neuronal cells (e.g., trigeminal ganglion) and lymphocytes, as well as lung epithelial cells in the case of EHV-4. Seroconversion to both viruses is common, with nearly 100% of horses surveyed having seroconverted to EHV-4. Because of this, as well as the prevalence of vaccination for the viruses, serology is of limited use in diagnosing infection with these 2 viruses.

The hyaluronic acid capsule is necessary for virulence, mediates binding of the bacterium to host cells, and confers resistance to phagocytosis. The M protein and a factor-H-binding protein bind fibrinogen and prevent deposition of complement factor C3b, thereby blocking recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages.

The nasal lesions are most common in the nostril, but can form larger masses obstructing the nasal cavity and invading adjacent tissues, including the retro-orbital space. The lesions in sheep are described to most consistently affect the ethmoid conchae.

Other viruses causing inclusion bodies in bronchiolar or airway epithelial cells include canine adenovirus 2, canid herpesvirus 1, and canine minute virus (canine parvovirus 1). Confirmation of the diagnosis benefits from a diversity of diagnostic options, including virus isolation, immunohistochemistry, indirect immunofluorescence, in situ hybridization, and PCR. Canid herpesvirus 1 is occasionally isolated from dogs with acute respiratory disease, although systemic disease in neonatal puppies is a more common manifestation. Aerosol challenge of 12-week-old dogs caused necrotizing rhinitis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, and multifocal alveolar necrosis with infrequent eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. Intraperitoneal inoculation of neonatal puppies with the same viral strain caused necrosis and hemorrhages in many organs, supporting the contention that the manifestation of disease is dependent on the route of exposure and the age of the host. Herpesviruses are infrequently isolated from dogs with kennel cough, either alone or with other infectious agents. The respiratory lesions are those to be expected from herpesviruses, namely necrotizing rhinotracheitis and possibly bronchopneumonia.

Cryptococcus neoformans, the usual cause of disease in temperate climates, is a saprophyte found in soil, pigeon or other avian guano, and decaying organic matter. C. gatti historically was found mainly in tropical climates, but is now considered to have a global distribution and is an important cause of disease in humans and dogs, especially in the Pacific Northwest of North America. C. neoformans and C. gatti exist in these environments in a filamentous form known as a teleomorph, with the name Filobasidiella neoformans and F. bacillosporus, respectively; this form of the organism undergoes both sexual as well as asexual reproduction in the environment. Based on genome sequence information C. neoformans is subdivided into types VNI, VNII, VNIII, and VNIV, and C. gatti is divided into VGI, VGII, VGIII, and VGIV. Where the agents fall in this classification scheme is of more than academic interest, as the pathogenicity and response to therapy varies by subtype of the organisms. Dogs are primarily infected with C. neoformans (except in regions with high endemicity for C. gatti, i.e., the Pacific Northwest of North America), whereas C. gatti is more frequent in cats. Most infected animals do not develop clinical disease. Immune suppression, such as from corticosteroid therapy or pre-existing infections, often underlies C. neoformans infections, but C. gatti is a primary pathogen and may infect hosts without known immune deficiencies. Infection is usually acquired by inhalation of basidiospores or desiccated yeast from contaminated dust. These small forms are inhaled into alveoli, where replication can occur with subsequent spread hematogenously or locally to other organs, such as the brain, eyes, lymph nodes, skin, and other organs. Occasional cases of cutaneous cryptococcosis are probably the result of local inoculation, and cryptococcal mastitis in cows is an ascending rather than hematogenous infection.",

Immature spherules are 10-20 \u00b5m diameter; as they mature, the spherules (or sporangia) enlarge up to 200 \u00b5m diameter and develop numerous 2-5 \u00b5m endospores (Fig. 5-76) . Mature spherules rupture, and the released endospores form either new spherules in tissue or mycelia if released to the environment. Infection of autopsy personnel has been attributed to inhalation of aerosolized tissue endospores, although the paucity of such cases suggests the risk is limited.",

Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis or C. posadasii, is endemic in the semiarid Lower Sonoran life zone of the southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. The fungus can apparently infect all mammals, with reports of disease occurring in a variety of Other fungal infections.

The diagnosis is based on finding adiaspores-large, spherical, uninucleate conidiain the nodules (Fig. 5-77 ).

Serum antibodies to Coccidioides immitis can be detected in most cases, particularly in the acute stages of disease, and high titers suggest active disease. Carnivores are infected by eating the infected viscera of herbivores, and the nymphs migrate to the nasal passages, where they mature. The parasites may be found anywhere in the nasal cavity, and occasionally, they find their way into the paranasal sinuses or pass via the Eustachian tube to the inner ear. They lie on the surface of the nasal mucosa and induce nasal irritation and a catarrhal to lightly blood-stained exudate. The gravid females discharge a large number of eggs that are removed by sneezing. The larvae of Linguatula or pentastomids of other species develop in the alimentary tract of the intermediate host and migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes and other organs, where they develop into infective nymphs within cysts that are encircled by inflamed fibrous tissue. The nymphs have histologic features of arthropods: pseudosegmented body, a chitinous cuticle with sclerotized openings, striated muscle, and a body cavity, as well as numerous brightly eosinophilic glands, and prominent villi lining the cuboidal epithelial cells in the intestine. Eucoleus aerophilus. Eucoleus aerophilus (Capillaria aerophila) is a trichurid nematode (order Enoplida, superfamily Trichuroidea, family Trichuridae) that parasitizes the trachea and bronchi of wild canids, domestic dogs, and occasionally cats. The worms are slender, 2-3 cm long, and embedded in the airway mucosa. Histologic examination reveals characteristic features: bacillary bands, which are segmental thickenings of the hypodermis; a stichosome, which is a deeply basophilic gland encircling the esophagus; and the possible presence of embryonated eggs. The eggs are laid in the airways, move with mucus to the pharynx, are swallowed, and passed in the feces. The eggs are oval with characteristic bipolar plugs, and closely resemble those of Trichuris vulpis of the intestine or Pearsonema (Capillaria) plica of the urinary bladder. The larvae undergo initial development in the egg, and then progress to the infective stage within earthworms, which are a required intermediate host. Eggs also hatch in ~40 days under suitable environmental conditions, but the resulting larvae are apparently not infective. After ingestion of the earthworm, the larvae reach the lungs in ~1 week and are mature in the trachea in ~25 days. Most infestations of E. aerophilus are inapparent and provoke only mild catarrhal inflammation. Heavy infestations cause more severe irritation that may result in obstruction of the lumen of the airways. Chronic coughing and intermittent dyspnea may then be observed, and secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia may occur.",

The mites are presumably transmitted by direct contact. They are usually an incidental finding, but clinical signs include sneezing, head shaking, and impaired olfaction. The mites induce catarrhal rhinitis and sinusitis with goblet cell hyperplasia, hyperemia, and infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. Pneumonyssoides is, in addition to allergic rhinitis, a consideration in cases of eosinophil-rich inflammation in the nasal mucosa. Linguatula serrata: pentastomiasis. Linguatula serrata, a parasitic arthropod, is of wide geographic distribution. Adult pentastomes are large, long-lived, specialized hematophagous parasites of the respiratory tracts of reptiles, amphibians, and carnivorous mammals. They are related to but distinct from the arthropods. The adults of L. serrata are transversely striated and tongue shaped (hence the name). Males are ~2 cm in length and females 1.0-1.2 cm. The definitive hosts are carnivores, but in aberrant parasitisms, herbivores and humans Crenosoma vulpis. Crenosoma vulpis is a common lungworm of foxes, but also occurs in other canids, including domestic dogs, perhaps in mustelids, but not in cats. It is a nematode of the superfamily Metastrongyloidea, family Crenosomatidae, and snails and slugs are intermediate hosts. Adult worms reside in bronchioles and small bronchi. After a prepatent period of 18-21 days, adults produce larvae that are coughed up, swallowed, and passed in the feces. The usual gross lesions in dogs are gray consolidation of the caudodorsal lung. Histologically, the lesions caused by adult worms are catarrhal, eosinophilic bronchitis and bronchiolitis. Aspirated larvae may induce a granulomatous reaction in alveoli. Angiostrongylus vasorum. Angiostrongylus vasorum occurs in endemic foci in parts of Western Europe, and is also reported in Uganda, South America, Eastern Asia, and Atlantic Canada; reports suggest the prevalence is increasing in Europe. Clinical expression of angiostrongylosis varies from mild to severe respiratory disease; cor pulmonale may develop in response to chronic pulmonary vascular disease and lung fibrosis.

Subcutaneous edema, with foci of fat necrosis, pancreatitis with peripancreatic fat necrosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, intestinal crypt necrosis, single-cell necrosis of hepatocytes, and interstitial pneumonia are all reported in VS-FCV infections.

Hyaline membranes may be present, and the alveoli often contain serofibrinous exudate and neutrophils. As the lesion heals, type II pneumocytes proliferate and form a cuboidal lining of the alveoli, and alveolar septa are thickened by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and fibrous tissue in the later stages. Miscellaneous parasites. Mammomonogamus sp. nematodes are reported to infect cats. Depending on the species of nematode, infection may occur in the nasal sinuses, larynx, and trachea.

D. arnfieldi is an occasional cause of chronic coughing in horses. Infection of adult horses often results in failure of the worm to develop to sexual maturity, and larvae cannot be detected in the feces of these animals. The worms can mature if horses or ponies are infected as young foals. The gross lesions are scattered wedge-shaped foci of overinflation, mostly in caudal lobes. In the center of the lesions are small bronchi packed with coiled adult worms. Histologically, the worms are associated with goblet cell hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltrates. Adult worms cause relatively little luminal response, whereas firststage larvae stimulate an intense mucopurulent reaction, or chronic catarrhal and eosinophilic bronchiolitis.Parascaris equorum larval migration causes nodular lesions in the lung. The acute lesions are distinctive by virtue of the mass of eosinophils present and the occasional presence of ascarid larvae in bronchioles or alveoli. However, the chronic nodules consist of aggregates of lymphoid tissue with fibrosis and mineralization, and need to be differentiated from residual lesions of small abscesses or granulomas.Echinococcus equinus causes cysts in the lung of horses in western Europe. The cysts have a characteristic histologic appearance, with an inner germinal membrane containing brood capsules, protoscolices, and mineralized corpuscles; a noncellular laminated middle layer; and an outer adventitial layer of fibrosis and chronic inflammation .Infection with amebae rarely causes encephalitis in horses. Multifocal granulomatous pneumonia with necrosis and thrombosis, with histologically visible trophozoites and cysts, are reported in those cases caused by Acanthamoeba.Miscellaneous parasitisms include Schistosoma nasalis, a cause of nasal granuloma in India; hydatid cysts; and Habronema spp., a rare cause of fibrotic nodules adjacent to bronchioles.

            "text": "Pneumonia caused by opportunistic bacterial pathogens is moderately common in dogs. Because most of the pathogens involved are commonly isolated from healthy dogs, a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia should prompt a search for predisposing causes. Aspiration pneumonia is frequent in dogs and may result from anesthesia, megaesophagus, myasthenia gravis, neurologic disease, laryngeal paralysis, or other causes of regurgitation or vomiting. Alternatively, bacterial pneumonia may arise as a consequence of impaired respiratory defenses. These include respiratory viral infections (reviewed previously); drugs that induce immunosuppression or neutropenia; concurrent disease conditions that impair immune responses or neutrophil function, including uremia, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, parvoviral enteritis, systemic mycoses, or primary immunodeficiencies; ciliary dyskinesia; and environmental and social stresses. Multiple bacterial pathogens may be isolated from the lung of some dogs with bacterial pneumonia, as would be expected if the primary problem in these dogs is a failure of lung defenses. Bordetella bronchiseptica, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. are the most common isolates from transtracheal aspirates of dogs with pneumonia. Bordetella, Streptococcus, and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) are discussed more fully later. Other strains of E. coli are frequently associated with aspiration pneumonia; complications include bacteremia or disseminated intravascular coagulation.The morphology of bacterial pneumonia in dogs does not usually suggest a specific infectious agent (see Bronchopneumonia, previously) . Lesions may affect entire lobes or follow a lobular distribution. Unilateral or lobar pneumonia may suggest aspiration as the cause.Canine influenza. H3N8 influenza A virus infection as a cause of respiratory disease in dogs was first recognized in 2004 in racing greyhounds, with subsequent identification in other populations of dogs. The virus has homology to and is thought to have arisen from equine influenza virus. The virus spreads readily among dogs, and thus is most common in animals involved in racing, shows, or frequent commingling with others. Rarely, dogs are infected with other influenza viruses, but inefficient transmission between dogs has so far limited their impact.Clinically, canine influenza is usually a self-limiting upper respiratory tract disease that manifests as anorexia, oculonasal discharge, and coughing. Histologically, influenza virus infection causes tracheobronchial epithelial cell necrosis, hyperplasia, and infiltration of neutrophils, and a unique lesion that similarly affects the bronchial glands. Less frequent is involvement of the distal airways, with bronchiolar erosion or hyperplasia with neutrophil exudates in the lumen, and alveolar infection with neutrophils in alveolar lumens and subtle proliferation of type II pneumocytes. In racing greyhounds, influenza can cause severe peracute disease and death related to hemorrhagic pneumonia associated with bacterial infection; hemorrhage into the pleural cavity and mediastinum may also be present. Diagnosis of canine influenza is based on RT-PCR assays using samples collected from the upper airways of typically affected dogs. Influenza virus can also be isolated from upper airway-nasal or tracheal collected at autopsy.Aspergillus fumigatus is the usual cause of mycotic rhinitis in dogs, although other species of Aspergillus or Penicillium are occasional causes of otherwise similar disease. These fungi are common in the environment and reach the nasal cavity of most normal animals by inhalation. It is not known whether disease results from exposure to higher numbers of inhaled fungi or from suppression of the normal nasal defenses, but immunosuppression or other predisposing causes have only rarely been identified in dogs with nasal aspergillosis.Lesions are often focal within the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses, and consist of yellow, green, or black plaque-like mats or masses of fungal growth (Fig. 5-72) . The surrounding mucosa is hyperemic and edematous, and there is often purulent exudate, caseous debris, or hemorrhage throughout the nasal cavity. Destruction of turbinate bones is common, and remodeling of the nasal septum or nasal bones may occur. Histologic diagnosis requires biopsy of the fungal plaques, which may be very localized despite the presence of widespread exudate. The plaques consist entirely of fungal hyphae, and occasionally contain conidia (see Fig. 5-72) . Aspergillus spp. hyphae are 5-7 \u00b5m diameter and have parallel sides, frequent septa, and branch dichotomously at 45\u00b0C. The infection is noninvasive, and hyphae are very rarely observed in biopsies of inflamed nasal tissue biopsies, but these tissues do have nonspecific lesions of suppurative or eosinophilic rhinitis. Aspergillus also causes chronic rhinitis and pulmonary fungus ball in German Shepherd dogs, described previously (see eFig. 5-45).",

            "text": "Infection is mostly reported in colonies of laboratory beagles, but cases are described in pet dogs. Adult Filaroides hirthi are 6-10 mm long and contain larvae or embryonated eggs in the uterus. The adults live in alveoli and respiratory bronchioles. Like other members of the Filaroididae, F. hirthi has a direct life cycle, and infective first-stage larvae are passed in the feces. Many infections are probably acquired from the dam.The lesions in most cases are incidental at autopsy, with greytan or black-green, 1-5 mm diameter nodules scattered widely in subpleural regions of the lung. Nodules may have clear cystic centers, or be white and firm. The lesions in fatal cases, which may occur in immunosuppressed dogs, are of severe generalized diffuse or miliary granulomatous pneumonia. Histologically, there is little response to living adult worms, but a severe granulomatous response with many eosinophils occurs around dead or degenerating worms. Killing the worms with an anthelmintic may incite a severe response. Larvae stimulate an acute neutrophilic reaction. Foci of granulomatous interstitial pneumonia can often be found in which worm remnants may no longer be identified. The diagnosis is based on discovery of larvae in smears of bronchial exudate, or identifying the adults in histologic sections of lung. Definitive diagnosis requires extraction of intact adults from the lungs, as the histologic appearance is similar to Andersonstrongylus milksi. Aelurostrongylus abstrusus. Aelurostrongylus abstrusus is a moderately common lungworm of cats. Cats may be subclinically infected and display no clinical signs, but heavy infections cause coughing or increased respiratory rate.Aelurostrongylus abstrusus is a nematode of the superfamily Metastrongyloidea, family Angiostrongylidae. The adults, which are slender and up to 1 cm long, live in the terminal and respiratory bronchioles. The eggs form nodular deposits in alveoli, where they embryonate and hatch to release first-stage larvae. The larvae move to the airways, are coughed up and swallowed, and passed in the feces. Snails and slugs are intermediate hosts, whereas birds, rodents, frogs, and lizards are paratenic (transport) hosts. The life cycle can be completed if a cat eats either an intermediate host or a paratenic host. Infective larvae migrate to the lungs and reach maturity ~4-6 weeks after ingestion of the third-stage larvae.Heavy infections in the prepatent period cause randomly distributed hemorrhages or white foci, which represent an eosinophilic and granulomatous reaction to the migrating larvae. In the patent period, there are 1-10 mm diameter, firm, off-white to pale yellow, slightly raised nodules scattered throughout the lungs. In severe infections, nodules may coalesce to form confluent areas of consolidation.Microscopically, the nodules are formed by masses of eggs and larvae in the alveoli and terminal bronchioles, with fewer adult worms (eFigs. 5-104, 5-105). Eosinophils and neutrophils infiltrate the early lesions, but most cases are dominated by mononuclear cells and giant cells in the alveoli and around degenerating eggs and larvae. Alveoli are dilated, and alveolar septa may be disrupted. Necrosis and mineralization seldom occur. Lymphocytic nodules form around vessels and airways, and there is hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the smooth muscle in the walls of the bronchioles and alveolar ducts. The presence of adult worms, eggs, or larvae in the bronchioles is associated with chronic catarrhal and eosinophilic bronchiolitis; similar inflammation may be present within the tracheal mucosa, presumably in response to larvae moving up the trachea to be swallowed. In older lesions from which eggs and larvae have disappeared, alveoli remain epithelialized and septa are persistently thickened by fibrous tissue and smooth",
