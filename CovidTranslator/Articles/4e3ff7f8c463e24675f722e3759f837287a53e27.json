            "text": "The SARS coronavirus is a positive-strand RNA virus. The 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which are processed to generate the viral replication complex. During viral replication, the replicase polyprotein undergoes extensive processing by two viral proteases namely, chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) and papainlike protease (PLpro). 5, 6 Because of their essential roles in viral replication, both proteases are recognized as attractive targets for development of anti-SARS therapeutics. 7 The structure and activity of active sites of both SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro have been elucidated. Thus far, inhibitor design efforts are mostly limited to SARS-CoV 3CLpro and numerous covalent and noncovalent inhibitors have been reported. 7 In our continuing interest in the design and development of SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, we recently reported structurebased design of a number of potent peptidomimetic SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors (1 and 2). 8 The SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site contains a catalytic dyad where a cysteine residue acts as a nucleophile and a histidine residue acts as the general acid base. 9 The inhibitors bind to SARS-CoV-3CLpro through covalent bonding with the active site cysteine 145 residue. These inhibitors contain peptidomimetic scaffolds and lacked adequate potency, particularly antiviral activity suitable for drug-development. Recently, Wong and co-workers reported a new class of potent small molecule benzotriazole ester-based 3CLpro inhibitors. Compound 3 is the most potent inhibitor among the benzotriazole esters. 10 The mode of action involved acylation of the active site Cys-145 assisted by the catalytic dyad. This irreversible enzyme acylation was verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the inhibited enzyme. While these inhibitors have shown very impressive SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme inhibitory activity, their antiviral activity required improvement. 11 It seems the indole-5-carboxylate moiety plays an important role in binding with the enzyme active site. Another class of hetereoaromatic ester inhibitors was also identified and studied. 12, 13 The 5-chloropyridine moiety in 4 proved to be the key unit for the activity against 3CLpro. The report however lacked antiviral data. We report herein the development of 3-chloropyridyl ester-based SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors that exhibit potent enzyme inhibitory activity as well as very good SARS-CoV antiviral activity in cell culture assays. We have also carried out molecular docking studies to obtain the potential binding mode of these inhibitors.",

In inhibitor 5, the benzotriazole unit was replaced by 5-chloropyridine unit. Inhibitor 5 has shown comparable enzymatic inhibitory potency (IC 50 0.31 \u03bcM) as that of 3. However, inhibitor 3 did not exhibit any antiviral activity while 5-chloropyridine ester 5 has antiviral activity with an EC 50 value of 24 \u03bcM. 18 When the indole nitrogen was acetylated, the resulting compound 6 remained quite potent (IC 50 of 0.40 \u03bcM) as did the tosylated indole 7 (IC 50 of 0.37 \u03bcM). Interestingly, its nitrobenzenesulfonamide analog 8 shows an improved IC 50 value (2 \u03bcM). We then investigated the importance of the carboxylic position on the benzene ring of indole. Accordingly, carboxylate substitution on indole rings at 5, 6, 4 and 7 positions resulted in chloropyridinyl esters 5, 9, 10 and 12, respectively. These inhibitors were evaluated and as it turned out, inhibitor 10, with a carboxylate at the 4-position, was the most potent inhibitor with an IC 50 of 30 nM, a 10-fold potency enhancement over 5 containing a carboxylate at the 5-position. Compound 10 also shows the best SARS-CoV antiviral activity with an EC 50 value of 6.9 \u03bcM. Acylation of 10 to 11 resulted in a 30-fold loss of potency. Penicillin-derived chloropyridine 13 did not show any appreciable activity. Tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative 14, however, exhibited an enzyme IC 50 value of 0.14 \u03bcM.

GOLD3.2 21 was used to dock our most active compound, 10 (GRL-0496), into the active site of the authentic SARS-CoV 3Clpro structure (PDBID: 2HOB). 22 In search of obtaining a model of the associated complex between the unreacted ester and protein, (i.e. prior to nucleophilic attack by CYS145), the distance between the carbonyl carbon atom of 10 and the sulfur atom of CYS145 was constrained to be in the range of 2.5-3.5\u00c5. This pre-reaction or 'collision complex' is shown in Figure 2 , and resulted in a distance of 2.8\u00c5 between the carbonyl carbon of 10 and the sulfur of CYS145. This orientation of the ligand has the pyridinyl chloride group situated in the S1 pocket, with the chloro group pointing towards the surface of the protein. The nitrogen of the chloropyridinyl leaving group is in close proximity (2.4\u00c5) to the imidazole nitrogen of HIS163. The carbonyl oxygen is situated between three backbone nitrogens, forming three hydrogen bonds. As shown in Figure 2 : the first hydrogen bond is from CYS145(NH) (2.32\u00c5), the second is from SER144 (NH) (2.38\u00c5), and the third is from GLY143(NH) (2.78\u00c5). This suggests that a fairly strong hydrogen bonding network is present within the active site which likely aids in positioning and stabilizing the carbonyl group of the ester for nucleophilic attack by the CYS145. The indole group of 10 is positioned near the more hydrophobic S2 pocket, with the indole nitrogen likely interacting with the imidazole group of HIS41, see Figure 2 .",

            "text": "Next, we analyzed the interaction between 10 and 3CLpro in the 'post reaction' or covalently modified state. The product of the reaction of 10 with 3CLpro was docked using a more recently released 3CLpro crystal structure, (PDBID: 2V6N) . 20 This crystal structure contains a benzotriazole ester molecule which has reacted with the thiol of CYS145, forming a covalently bound ligand similar to the compounds presented in this paper. We have used this crystal structure for the post-reaction complex due to the notable movement of the HIS41 in 2V6N, which flips and is able to pi stack with the aromatic moiety of the smaller covalently bound ligand. 20 GOLD3.2 21 was chosen again for generating this model, as it has the capability for docking covalently bound ligands. Figure 3 is a docked model of 10 covalently attached to the CYS145 sulfur atom. The model suggests that the indole group of 10 shifts and positions itself where the leaving group was in the complex, more towards the S1 pocket. This positioning of inhibitor 10 in the complex is not surprising as a similar orientation has been proposed before by James' group for similar esters. 23, 24 More importantly though is the obvious pi-pi stacking of the indolyl of 10 with the imidazole ring of HIS41, which is also seen in the benzotriazole group of the referenced crystal structure (2V6N). 20 There is approximately 4\u00c5 between the aromatic rings of the indolyl and the imidazole of HIS41. This interaction clearly determines the position of the indolyl group of our compounds. Other residues shown in Figure 3 , such as ASP187 and GLN189 are more than 5\u00c5 away from the indolyl, but might come into play with larger substitutents, such as in compound 11.",

Dynamic enzymatic rearrangement in the vicinity of CYS145 have recently been suggested from the Xray structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro that had been reacted with 1-(4dimethylaminobenzoyloxyl)-benzotriazole, 20 and suggests that after covalently linking to CYS145, the indolyl of 10 shifts towards the S1 pocket and stacks with the shifted imidazole ring of HIS41, locking the orientation, with implications of where substitutions on the indolyl ring would be most beneficial. By having both of these models now available, structural modifications of the indole group can be tailored to enhance interactions with the S2 pocket for the complex formation to readily occur, but at the same time, consider that the ligand must be mobile enough to then occupy the S1 pocket post reaction.",
