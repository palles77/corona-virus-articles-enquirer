Patients Patient 1, a 37-year-old woman, had good health before the illness. She was admitted on March 13, 2003, with a history of fever, cough, and general muscle pain for 10 days. Oxygen saturation on admission was 89% on 50% oxygen. The chest radiograph showed patchy haziness. The patient soon developed respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation; ribavirin and antibiotic treatment was then started. The ratio of partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) was 24\u00b72 kPa on the day before death. She died on March 23, after 10 days of assisted ventilation. Patient 2, a 39-year-old woman who was previously well, had indirect contact with a person who developed fever after return from Guangzhou, China. She subsequently developed fever with shortness of breath and diarrhoea. She had lymphopenia at admission, and the chest radiograph showed infiltrates in the left upper zone. Treatment with ribavirin and steroids was started on March 21. She developed respiratory failure the next day and was intubated. She had repeated cardiac arrests and died on March 24. Patient 3, a 64-year-old man, developed influenza-like symptoms and left pleuritic chest pain on Feb 15. A chest radiograph taken a day later showed haziness in the left lower zone. He subjectively improved after self-medication with levofloxacin and penicillin. He visited Hong Kong on Feb 21 as a tourist, but his condition then deteriorated. He was admitted directly to the intensive-care unit and intubated on Feb 22. Investigation showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass changes on chest radiograph and severe oxygen desaturation. Despite empirical antimicrobial coverage for typical, atypical, and hospital-acquired pneumonia, his condition continued to deteriorate. He was empirically treated with oseltamivir, foscarnet, intravenous immunoglobulin and, at a later stage, ribavirin and steroids. After ventilation for 10 days with a peak airway pressure of 36 cm water, tidal volume of 730 mL, and PaO 2 /FiO 2 9\u00b78 kPa, he died on March 4 with acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure.",

He did not respond to doxycycline, amantadine, and cefotaxime. An open lung biopsy was done on March 4. Routine microbiological and virological investigations were negative. He was empirically treated with oseltamivir, steroids, and ribavirin. Non-oliguric renal failure developed and was later complicated by nosocomial pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

He developed influenza-like symptoms while in Hong Kong but still travelled overseas on Feb 26. Investigation at his destination showed lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in the peripheral blood examination, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph. He went into respiratory failure on March 2, and on March 5 was transferred back to Hong Kong, where he was ventilated. The ventilation pressure was 20/10 cm water most of the time. Positive end-expiratory pressure was 15-17 cm water. The tidal volume was generally kept at 450-650 mL, and the PaO 2 was between 70% and 90% and FiO 2 between 80% and 100%. His renal function deteriorated progressively from March 9 to March 12, and at the time of death the urea concentration was 10\u00b76 mmol/L and creatinine 218 \u00b5mol/L. Total bilirubin varied between 18 \u00b5mol/L and 27 \u00b5mol/L. Despite intensive support and antimicrobial coverage with piperacillin-tazobactam, azithromycin, and oseltamivir, he died on March 13. Patient 6 was a 77-year-old man with good health previously. On March 2 he was admitted to hospital for increasing shortness of breath, fever, and cough for Routine microbiological investigations included culture of blood and sputum for bacterial pathogens. 3 Serology was done with complement-fixation tests for respiratory viruses, chlamydiae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.",

Clearing of the chromatin was also seen. Giantcell formation was seen within the alveolar lumen in four cases, and there were a few cells that contained amphophilic to basophilic cytoplasmic granules within enlarged pneumocytes. One patient (patient 3) showed fibrin thrombi within pulmonary vessels, and another (patient 1) showed intimal swelling of pulmonary vessels. In three of four cases, the giant cells were cytoplasm. We therefore hypothesise that this cytoplasmic amphophilia may be due to viral assembly within the Golgi apparatus-a feature seen on electron microscopy of the open lung biopsy sample from patient 4. 3 The histological changes of uncomplicated viral pneumonias are rarely described, and reports tend to be derived from post-mortem examination of patients who succumb to the pneumonia; thus, they may not be representative of the majority of pneumonia patients, who survive. 3, 15 The same is true for SARS, because the patients admitted to hospital have not been in a suitable medical condition to warrant biopsy. However, several features of fatal coronaviral pneumonia can be identified. Coronavirus infection in the early stages seems to stimulate epithelial cells and results in cellular proliferation and squamous metaplasia in the lung. This type-2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy has also been identified with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (an arterivirus tentatively classified under the Coronaviridae 16 ) as well as porcine respiratory coronavirus (previously known as transmissible gastroenteritis virus, respiratory variant). In those infections mild type-2 pneumocyte proliferation is associated with squamous metaplasia. 17 In SARS, macrophage proliferation is more prominent in the consolidated areas of the lung; this distribution is also seen with porcine respiratory coronavirus. 18 In contrast to typical diffuse alveolar damage in which neutrophils and fibroblasts are the main cellular agents and macrophages have a lesser role, 9 in patients with fatal SARS macrophages are the prominent leucocyte in the alveoli, even in the early stages of the disease. The finding of haemophagocytosis in the lung and white-pulp atrophy of the spleen identified in SARS is reminiscent of that reported in fatal influenza subtype H5N1 disease in 1997. 19 Haemophagocytosis has been attributed to cytokine dysregulation. 20 Lymphopenia is another feature common to both SARS-CoV and H5N1 influenza pneumonia. 21 Both viruses have crossed to human beings from animals or birds. 3, 21 Experimental studies in which macrophages are infected in vitro suggest that, compared with conventional human influenza viruses, the subtype H5N1 influenza A viruses isolated in 1997 are hyperinducers of proinflammatory cytokines. 22 Human coronavirus OC43 can replicate in human macrophages in vitro. 23 Taken together, the similarity of clinical and pathological changes in SARS-CoV pneumonia and H5N1 pneumonia suggest that proinflammatory cytokines released by stimulated macrophages in the alveoli have a prominent role in pathogenesis of SARS, resulting in cytokine dysregulation. This idea has implications for the management of coronaviral pneumonia. Intervention with steroids might modulate this cytokine response and prevent a fatal outcome, as has been proposed for nonviral acute respiratory distress syndrome. 24 Although we did not find PCR evidence of a secondary viral infection, such as HMPV, in pigs infected with some isolates of porcine respiratory coronavirus, the respiratory lesions were severe enough to predispose the pigs to secondary bacterial or mycoplasmal infections or to lead to combined viral infections. 25 As we have already mentioned, the histological features of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection are similar to those of SARS-CoV infection; it is possible that SARS-CoV infection in human beings may \"open the door\" to secondary infections, as previously reported. 5 The patients who received ribavirin therapy still had PCR and electron-microscopic evidence of SARS-CoV in the lung. This finding supports clinical evidence that a search ARTICLES THE LANCET \u2022 Vol 361 \u2022 May 24, 2003 \u2022 www.thelancet.com positive for the macrophage marker CD68 (figure 4); in one case, they were positive for the epithelial marker AE1/3. In the patient who had frozen tissue available, no staining was identified to adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, or influenza viruses A or B on frozen-section immunofluoresence.",

In previous studies, healthy controls and patients with unrelated disease had no evidence of SARS-CoV antibody or RNA in the serum or the respiratory tract, respectively. 3 In patients with disease of duration less than 10 days there was hyaline-membrane formation, pneumocyte proliferation, and oedema. Diffuse alveolar damage was seen in cases of longer duration. This diffuse alveolar damage typically goes through an exudative phase followed by a proliferative phase, 9 although others have described a three-stage process: an inflammatory or exudative phase, a proliferative phase, and a final fibrotic phase. 10 Viral infections resulting in diffuse alveolar damage typically fall into two categories; influenza viruses A and B and adenovirus cause most cases of viral pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. Immunocompromised hosts are susceptible to pneumonias caused by cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses, measles virus, and adenovirus. 11 In addition to the diffuse alveolar damage here, morphological features of giant cells and pneumocyte hyperplasia, which appear to be prominent in this viral infection, were seen in these patients. 4, 12 Multinucleate giant cells within the alveoli have previously been reported in patients with SARS, 4,12 but their derivation has remained unclear. We have documented that in three of the patients these giant cells are of macrophage origin and in one other patient they are epithelial in origin. These giant cells were not present in the ante-mortem lung biopsy sample and were present only in patients with disease progression for longer than 8 days from admission. Some animal coronaviruses induce syncytium formation in cell culture, 13 and SARS-CoV also induces focal syncitium formation 4 in Vero cells.",
