In 2001, chronic lower respiratory disease was listed as the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, claiming 123,000 lives, whereas pneumonia and influenza together contributed to 62,000 deaths per year as the seventh leading cause of death. 1 Although the precise relationship of aerosolized pathogens to the lower respiratory death rate is unclear, a suggested mechanism of infection is contamination of the lower airway epithelium by microorganisms from aerosolized droplets. 2 Aerosols that compromise the respiratory system have also been implicated in other diseases, such as asthma, heart disease, and cancer. 3, 4 The body is assaulted by pathogenic microorganisms many times each day. Subsequent development of infection depends on 2 factors: the host's susceptibility to disease and the organism's ability to cause disease.",

Toxin production is another function that enhances virulence.

Factors such as nasal vs mouth breathing, preexisting airway disease, hygroscopic nature of the particles, and breathing patterns are factors that determine the depth of penetration of airborne particles. 6 It has been well documented that dental procedures can introduce oral pathogens into the bloodstream or lymphatic system via direct hematogenous spread or aspiration to cause various medical conditions, including bacteremia, 7 aspiration pneumonia, 8 coronary heart disease, 9 preterm low birth weight, 10 infective endocarditis, 11 gastrointestinal infections, 12 and osteogenic and prosthetic implant infections. 13 The pulmonary defense system usually maintains the 300 million sterile alveoli in the lower respiratory tract, but systemic outcomes are more commonly seen in elderly, institutionalized people or patients with poor oral hygiene or periodontitis. 14 One study estimated that a third of lung abscesses are caused by oral microorganisms after direct aspiration of saliva or dental plaque or from blood dissemination of septic emboli. 15 It has also been found that aspiration of upper airway material occurs more often while a patient is in a state of depressed consciousness-eg, in 45% of healthy subjects during sleep or impaired consciousness. 16 Changes in physical condition might also influence one's predisposition to disease. For example, a recent study suggested that age-related decline of respiratory tract ciliary function can also contribute to greater host susceptibility to respiratory infections. 17 The association of oral bacteria and systemic diseases is further supported when oral hygiene was implemented to reduce colonizing bacteria. Yoneyama et al 18 demonstrated that the risk of pneumonia could be reduced by 1.67 times in the intervention group practicing improved oral hygiene compared with that of the control group.",

            "text": "The American Thoracic Society Statement of 2003 further emphasized that the occupational component of adult-onset asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is authentic, but the recognition is difficult for 2 reasons. \"These are multifactorial diseases strongly associated with nonoccupational exposures,\" and \"the occupational dose-response for obstructive airway disease is complex.\" 20 Both environmental and genetic factors play roles in etiology. The literature review for the statement showed that 15% of both work-related asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease involves a cost estimate of nearly $7 billion in the United States alone. 20 It is estimated that about 150 billion microorganisms can be found in 1 g of crevicular fluid collected from a dental patient with poor oral hygiene, and about 6 billion microorganisms are present in 1 mL of saliva. 21 One study showed that as many as 100,000 bacteria per cubic foot of aerosols can be generated from a patient's mouth that normally contains 300 to 500 different species of bacteria. 22 Despite the lack of definitive epidemiologic studies that link dental aerosols to disease transmission, the reported resurgence of bacterial pathogens with airborne transmissibility such as tuberculosis has raised concerns about potential risks to health care providers as a result of inhalation of aerosol contamination during dental procedures. It has been reported that dental aerosols can contaminate the skin and mucous membranes of the mouth, respiratory passages, and eyes of dental personnel. 23 For example, higher prevalences of aerosol-related symptoms such as nasal, ocular, and skin discharges have been observed in dental hygienists. 24 The concern in dentistry is contamination by aerosolization. An aerosol is defined as a gas generated by coughing, sneezing, or any act that expels oral fluids into the air. If these particles consist of microorganisms or their by-products-ie, endotoxins or mycotoxins-the aerosol is called a bioaerosol. It can consist of cell particles, droplets, and airborne dust and debris. Infectious bioaerosols, on the other hand, are those that are generated as respirable particles. The infectious potential of aerosols depends on several factors, including aerosol generation, particle size and concentration, viability of the contaminating microorganisms, infectivity and virulence, airflow, climate, and host susceptibility. 25 Inhalation of the larger 10 to 15 \u03bcm droplet nuclei particles is more closely related to upper respiratory infections, whereas the smaller 0.5 to 3.0 \u03bcm droplet nuclei tend to accumulate in the lower respiratory tract (1 \u03bcm = 1/25 thousandth of an inch). Most respiratory infections transmitted through inhalation of droplet nuclei are less than 5 \u03bcm in diameter. It was reported that most dental aerosol droplets have a diameter of 5 \u03bcm or less and are concentrated within 2 feet (approximately 61 cm) of the patient's mouth. 26 Particles of 2.5 \u03bcm in diameter can circulate for days in moderately turbulent air, potentially prolonging their harmful effects. 27 The disease potential to health care providers and patients from inhalation of aerosolized oral bacteria generated from dental procedures is unclear. A clinical study showed that airborne infections and tuberculosis occurred more often in dentists than in people in other occupations. 28 Dental students have also been reported to contract more tuberculosis than medical students. 28 Nonetheless, no epidemiologic study on direct transmission of tuberculosis to dental workers from contaminated aerosols has been documented. Similarly, there is no evidence that hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus infection can be transmitted through aerosol inhalation. However, a new study has suggested that severe acute respiratory syndrome can be transmitted by aerosols. 29 In 2000, Greco and Greene 30 found that most inanimate particles of aerosolized composite resin liberated during grinding are mainly 0.1 to 0.2 \u03bcm. These could impose hazardous health conditions for the orthodontist and staff, especially if combined with plaque and debris. They also found that airborne particle liberation secondary to the high speed of bonding resin, ceramic, glass ionomer cements, microetch material, and self-cured acrylic generates a persistent, respirable cloud near the operator and the patient. These particles are not filtered by the mucociliary defenses of the pulmonary tree.",

Dustless and \"dusty\" alginate use generates a respirable cloud that also persists for at least several minutes in tranquil air. These preliminary results showed that 2 commonly used clinical masks are ineffective in protecting the operators from particulate aerosols generated during routine orthodontic procedures; they do not block particles of less that 5 \u03bcm. This is a concerning finding because 10-\u03bcm particles can become lodged in the upper respiratory tract, and particles of 2.5 \u03bcm or smaller tend to be deposited in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. 31 In general, aerosolized bacteria appear to be composed of predominantly grampositive species. Some bacteria that have been implicated in airborne transmission in health care facilities include grampositive, group A streptococci, S aureus, Neisseria meningitis, and Bordetella pertussis. Toroglu et al 32 also found the most common microorganisms in the aerosol spray during orthodontic debonding procedures to consist of grampositive species such as streptococcus, neisseria, staphylococcus and others in 43%, 18%, and 17% proportions, respectively. In a subsequent study, they found that hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B DNA were detected in the debonding aerosol of some but not all carriers. 32 Nonetheless, this study confirmed that the debonding procedure should always be considered a potential health hazard.",

Because fixed orthodontic appliances tend to interfere with conventional oral care, higher rates of intraoral pathogen colonization might result. The risk of disease transmission from infectious aerosols generated during orthodontic proce-dures is reaffirmed when hepatitis B virus DNA in the aerosol sample from hepatitis B virus carriers during orthodontic debonding procedure was detected. 32 We used a novel system developed to collect aerosolized bacteria generated during orthodontic debonding procedures. We assessed the presence of bioaerosols and subsequently liberated speciate bacteria during the removal of orthodontic appliances.

Mask efficacy was found to be variable. Classification of mask efficacy is with particle filtration efficiency (PFE) or bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE). PFE ratings refer to the mask's ability to trap particles with a fixed nonviable particle size of 0.1 to 1.0 \u03bcm. BFE ratings are correlated to the mask's ability to trap viable particles of 1 to 5 \u03bcm. The catalogs of 2 large dental supply companies showed 61 and 70 different clinical masks. Although the cost per mask varied between $ 0.20 to $1.09, there was no correlation between PFE or BFE and mask cost. Other dental supply catalogs list masks predominantly by BFE. It is doubtful whether many dental practitioners are aware of PFE and BFE ratings as measures of mask efficacy. The masks in this study were those used in the principal investigator's office, because of familiarity with the manufacturer's name and advice of supply representatives. Based on our results, masks with PFE or BFE of at least that of the N-95 are advisable (95% filtration rate at 0.3 \u03bcm). PFE and BFE ratings and the efficacy values we determined are independent of mask adaptation. Facial hair and the adaptation of the mask to the operator's face also affect protection levels. 34 Finally, mask users must be aware that viruses are significantly smaller than 0.1 to 5.0 \u03bcm and are commonly aerosolized. 26 Thus, clinicians should consider the use of high-speed suction during all debonding procedures, but reduction of aerosolized viruses by highspeed suction has yet to be verified.",

The diameters of the bacterial species collected by this technique are sufficiently small to be inhaled and deposited in the alveolar spaces of patients and clinicians. In a pilot study of 2 brands of commonly used dental masks, the clinician remained unprotected from aerosolized bacteria because of the mask pore size exceeded the bacterial diameter. An industrial mask was effective in preventing transmission of aerosolized bacteria. Clinicians should choose a protective mask with the most efficient PFE and BFE rating and the best facial adaptation possible. Further mask efficacy study is ongoing.",
