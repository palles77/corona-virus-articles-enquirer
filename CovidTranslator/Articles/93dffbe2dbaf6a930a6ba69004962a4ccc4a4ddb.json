Typically, infl uenza B is associated with relatively mild, local outbreaks, whereas infl uenza A is the cause of world-wide pandemics. Upon infection, two antigens present on the viral surface, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase result in human immunity, but since many subtypes of these antigens exist that vary over time, immunity in the population is blunted. Vaccination is advocated in high-risk groups including patients with underlying (lung) diseases and in the elderly, and needs to be repeated annually with vaccines expected to cover the expected change in viral antigenicity. When started early, antiviral drugs, especially neuraminidase-inhibitors can be prescribed in adjunct to nonspecifi c interventions in an attempt to shorten disease duration and to prevent complications in case of an infl uenza infection. Currently, the effectiveness of antiviral drugs specifi cally in patients with COPD has not been proven.",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by largely irreversible progressive airfl ow limitation. This airfl ow obstruction is associated with an infl ammatory process in the bronchial mucosa. Most patients are current or ex-smokers. Many patients have one or more exacerbations per year, which are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function and decreased quality of life (NHLBI 2006) . Exacerbations are responsible for over half of the direct disease-related costs of care. Viral infections including infl uenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and many other viruses are important causes of exacerbations, excess morbidity and mortality in COPD (Wedzicha 2004; Wilkinson et al 2006) . During seasonal outbreaks of viral infections, patients with COPD are at risk for respiratory illness-related hospitalizations, irrespective of age or disease severity (Gorse et al 2006) . Prevention and early treatment of exacerbations are therefore believed to be an important target in the management of COPD. Inhaled steroids may reduce the number and the severity of exacerbations in patients with severe airfl ow obstruction and frequent exacerbations, but the effects are limited (Burge et al 2000; Jones 2004 ). Inhaled bronchodilators may have similar effects. Annual infl uenza vaccination is recommended in most COPD guidelines and neuraminidase inhibitors are available for the treatment of infl uenza.",

            "text": "The infl uenza virus belongs to the orthomyxovirus group. The infl uenza virus is a spherical or fi lamentous enveloped virus. Virus strains are characterized by different hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) subclasses. Hemagglutinin, a surface glycopeptide, aids attachment of the virus at specifi c receptor sites on the walls of susceptible host cells and facilitates entry of viruses into the cell. The enzyme neuraminidase facilitates cell penetration by pinocytosis and stimulates the release of viruses from the host cell by budding through the cell membrane (Matrosovich et al 2004) . The virus exists in two main forms: A and B. Infl uenza A is generally responsible for epidemics and pandemics. Infl uenza B causes milder, generally more localized and less severe outbreaks, eg, in schools or in camps. A lesser known C form rarely causes disease in humans. 15 H subtypes (H1-H15) and nine N subtypes (N1-N9) have been identifi ed for infl uenza A viruses. New antigenic variants of infl uenza A develop at irregular intervals through the process of antigenic shift, whereas point mutations in infl uenza A and B viruses result in changes in amino acids in the H and the N glycoproteins responsible for humoral immunity, resulting in antigenic drift (Zambon 1999) . These changes render the individual's immune response less able to combat new variants. As a result, major shifts in antigenic profi les of the viruses can cause epidemics. The immune system is less blunted by the minor antigenic drifts that cause less severe outbreaks (Stamboulian et al 2000) . In 1957 the appearance of infl uenza A2 type H2-N2 was associated with over 20 million deaths. The worldwide pandemic that occurred in 1968 was the result of the emergence in Hong Kong of infl uenza H3-N2. Minor antigenic drifts have since then caused smaller outbreaks in various areas of the world. Avian fl u, caused by H5-N1, has emerged in 1997 and re-emerged in 2004-2005 and represents a major change in viral surface antigens, and transmission to humans has been shown to be a serious threat (Beigel et al 2005) .",

In most cases infl uenza is an acute febrile respiratory disease that occurs in annual outbreaks of varying severity. The incubation period of infl uenza is 1 to 3 days. Infl uenza typically causes extensive destruction of airway epithelial cells (Hers 1966) . Symptoms start abruptly and consist of fever, shivering, and diffuse pains in the extremities. Many patients present with early, prominent systemic symptoms and have headache, soreness of the throat, and dry cough that can persist for several weeks (Monto et al 2000) . Mortality can be high in the elderly especially in patients with chronic respiratory or cardiac diseases. Recovery can take up to 3 months and secondary bacterial infections are common, particularly with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus infl uenzae. Staphylococcus aureus superinfections can cause pneumonia that has a mortality of up to 20% (Brundage 2006) .",

Other processes believed to be of importance are an imbalance of proteinases and antiproteinases and oxidative stress. Many cells and mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of infl ammation in COPD. With time this infl ammation can result in structural changes in the bronchial wall and destruction of lung parenchyma or emphysema, and consequently in irreversible airfl ow obstruction and gas exchange abnormalities. Host factors are believed to be important in the pathogenesis of the characteristic infl ammation in COPD, as are viruses (Proud and Chung-Wai 2006) . Also, host behavior in response to viruses and possible aberrant antiviral host responses may infl uence the persistence of infl ammation following exposure to viruses. In stable COPD latent respiratory viruses, such as RSV or adenoviruses have been associated with accelerated lung function decline, independent of smoking status, exacerbation frequency, and lower airway bacterial load (Mallia and Johnston 2006) . RSV may also be associated with systemic infl ammation. Whether other viruses, such as different infl uenza strains, have similar effects in stable COPD is at present unknown. It has been shown that respiratory viruses, such as RSV and also infl uenza viruses, enter into the bronchial epithelial cells where they can replicate and result in epithelial cell destruc-tion and necrosis. This results in increased permeability of the mucosa, which allows other pathogens and irritants to penetrate, leads to neurogenic infl ammation by substance P and bradykinin, M2-and \u03b22-receptor dysfunction, and contributes to bronchial hyperresponsiveness (Wilkinson et al 2006) . Airway hyperresponsiveness causes excessive airway narrowing in COPD patients.",

Of these, rhinovirus and enteroviruses, both belonging to the picornavirus group of RNA viruses, stand out.

Rhinoviruses attach to airway epithelium cells through intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and thereby cause infl ammatory cell recruitment and activation.

Unfortunately, signifi cant variation within the major virus types causing disease limits the success of vaccination programmes. Since infl uenza viruses display antigenic shift and drift, new vaccines must be developed at regular intervals. In response to the arrival of new pandemic strains, new vaccines must be made available in suffi cient quantities. The effectiveness of the vaccines, usually inactivated virus vaccines containing 3 virus strains (2 type A and 1 type B) depends on the similarity between the strains in the vaccine and the virus strains likely to circulate in the upcoming winter. Protection occurs through circulating antibodies to H and N or stimulation of cytotoxic T-cell responses. Protection by infl uenza vaccination is only effective in 70% of patients and only lasts for one year (WHO 2005) . New vaccines must be prepared each year to cover the expected change in antigenicity. As a consequence, by defi nition supplies are limited in case of an emerging epidemic. Obviously, the benefi t of vaccination is largest in epidemic years when the vaccine strain is similar to the epidemic strain.",

The literature regarding the effects of N-inhibitors for preventing and treating infl uenza in healthy adults has recently been reviewed by Jefferson and colleagues (2006) . This excellent review summarizes the result of 52 randomized controlled trials testing N-inhibitors in controlled clinical prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and treatment trials. They conclude that oseltamivir in a daily oral dose of 75 mg and of inhaled zanamivir 10 mg daily have no effect in prophylaxis of infl uenza-like illness compared with placebo. Whether higher doses are more effective is uncertain. The effi cacy of oseltamivir compared with placebo, orally administered in a dose of 75 mg daily, against symptomatic infl uenza is 61%.
