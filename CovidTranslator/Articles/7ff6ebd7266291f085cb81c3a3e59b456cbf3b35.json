As a result, we can readjust the disability weight currently assigned to schistosomiasis-and the resulting DALYs lost-to a much higher level. King's results should trigger a better quantification of the development impact of schistosomiasis. Beyond this, their analysis should encourage a Extending the benefits of deworming for development 1520 www comprehensive re-evaluation of the burden on human and economic development of a group of highly prevalent but still concealed communicable diseases of the poor, including soil-transmitted helminthiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, cysticercosis, echinococcosis, foodborne trematode infections, and trachoma. The past 20 years of schistosomiasis control have been characterised by two major advances. The first is the acknowledgment that even in areas where reinfection is intense, regular chemotherapy can effectively control morbidity. The second is the endorsement in 2001 by the World Health Assembly of a novel public-health strategy for the integrated control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis and schistosomiasis. 7 The aim of this strategy, tailored specifically for areas with high transmission, is to remove the disease burden by regular treatment of high-risk groups within a broader context of preventive measures such as improvement of living conditions and hygienic behaviour. [8] [9] [10] When possible, regular treatment should be delivered through existing channels for the sake of sustainability. School health-programmes, also targeted at non-enrolled school-age children, are an excellent vehicle for the delivery of integrated interventions to a fundamentally high-risk group. Recently, we have also seen a multiplication of country experiences for the delivery of deworming to preschool children, packaged with vaccinations and/or vitamin A distribution. 11 The communitydirected treatment approach used in the onchocerciasis control-programme might be an option for delivery of combined treatment packages to remote communities.",

The first is the need to ensure sustainability of delivery, because regular treatment will have to be delivered for a long time before improvement of living conditions will eventually provide a permanent solution. The second concern is the potential limitation of a chemotherapy-based strategy should drug resistance arise. We therefore believe that appropriate tools need to be developed and mechanisms put in place to enable monitoring of any reduction in drug efficacy so that strategic changes can be made in a timely manner. 13 We also believe that research for new drugs and new control tools, such as the possible development of a hookworm vaccine, should be pursued. 14 King and colleagues have added a further dimension to the effect that chemotherapy against schistosomiasis may have on disability. We believe that this novel information adds strength to the process of development of a comprehensive public-health strategy to control the burden of chronic endemic diseases in the developing world. We also hope that such a strategy will yield a high return on investment in terms of contribution towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals. 15 ",
