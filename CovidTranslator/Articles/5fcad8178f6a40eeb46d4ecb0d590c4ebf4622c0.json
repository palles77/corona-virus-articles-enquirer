Serotherapy reduces GvHD but potentially increases the risk of viral infection by delaying immune reconstitution. Because many PID patients have preexisting viral infections, the optimal dose of serotherapy is unclear. We performed a retrospective analysis in 34 consecutive PID patients undergoing CBT and compared immune reconstitution, viral infection, GvHD, mortality, and long-term immune function between high-dose (n \u00bc 11) and low-dose (n \u00bc 9) serotherapy. Serotherapy dose had no effect on neutrophil engraftment. Median CD3 \u00fe engraftment occurred at 92.5 and 97 days for high-and low-dose serotherapy, respectively. The low-dose serotherapy group had higher CD3 \u00fe , CD4 \u00fe , and early thymic emigrant counts at 4 months compared with the high-dose group. GvHD severity and number of viral infections did not differ between serotherapy doses. Survival from the transplantation process was 90.9% for high-dose and 100% for low-dose groups. In conclusion, low-dose serotherapy enhanced T cell reconstitution and thymopoiesis during the first year after CBT with no increase in GvHD.",

            "text": "Serotherapy in the form alemtuzumab (T and B cell depleting anti-CD52 humanized monoclonal antibody) is added to conditioning regimens to reduce the incidence of GvHD [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Immune reconstitution is delayed by alemtuzumab in patients with malignant and nonmalignant hematological conditions [13, 16, 17] with some studies suggesting slower immune reconstitution with higher doses used [12, 18] . This slower immune reconstitution is, in turn, associated with an increased incidence of viral reactivation, notably cytomegalovirus [17, [20] [21] [22] , adenovirus [14, 23, 24] and respiratory viruses [25] . This is particularly pertinent when considering CBT for PID because many patients have active or latent viral infections at the time of HSCT and CBT is considered to have slower immune reconstitution and be virologically na\u00efve [4, 5] . The role of serotherapy in CBT for PID has not been explored to date. We report the results of a retrospective study of the effects of 2 alemtuzumab-based serotherapy dose regimens on lymphocyte reconstitution, GvHD, viral infection, and mortality in PID patients who underwent CBT at an international center.",

A retrospective study of these patients was performed, of which 14 have been previously reported [6] . There was a systematic change in serotherapy policy at the Children's BMT Unit in 2006 to 2007, when the alemtuzumab dose was reduced to determine if it had the same protective effects on GvHD without an increase in viral infection. Two patients were excluded from further analysis because they received alemtuzumab before conditioning at 3 and 4 weeks before CBT, and another was excluded because the patient received rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) instead of alemtuzumb. Those who received no serotherapy (n \u00bc 11) were also excluded because 6 did not receive chemotherapeutic conditioning and others were selected to this group based on clinical presentation. The remaining patients were retrospectively nonrandomly assigned to highdose (alemtuzumab ! .9 mg/kg given in 5 divided doses before day -10 or between day -8 and day -4; n \u00bc 11) or low-dose (alemtuzumab .3 to .6 mg/kg given in 3 divided doses on consecutive days between day -11 and day -6; n \u00bc 9) serotherapy groups for the purpose of analysis. No alemtuzumab pharmacokinetic studies were performed. Underlying diagnoses by serotheraphy group are shown in Supplementary Table S1 .",

Giving T lymphocytee depleting serotherapy as GvHD prophylaxis prolongs T lymphopenia post transplantation [12, 18] and giving high doses can increase the risk of viral infection further [14, 17, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . In our study, lower dose serotherapy improved T lymphocyte reconstitution with better thymopoiesis at 4 months post transplant than high-dose serotherapy. This is particularly pertinent in the setting of CBT for PID. In our study, the majority of patients had SCID and, therefore, further delay in T cell reconstitution from excessive serotherapy might delay clearance of pre-existing viral infection. The delay in immune reconstitution between high-and lowdose serotherapy could be explained by the prolonged exposure of the graft to lympholytic antibodies when higher doses are given. Lympholytic concentrations of alemtuzumab have been shown to be present up to 56 days after HSCT when very high doses are given in vivo [31] .",

Thymopoiesis was evident at 1 year after transplantation [32] . In contrast to this study by Chiesa et al., our study demonstrated a delayed restoration of median T cell counts until 4 months post CBT when low-dose serotherapy was given and a further delay in T lymphocyte reconstitution to 6 months post CBT when using high dose serotherapy. CD3 \u00fe reconstitution in our study improved at 4 months when low-dose serotherapy was given as compared with high-dose serotherapy, which is likely caused by corresponding improvements in CD4 \u00fe and CD4 \u00fe ETEE counts in the low-dose serotherapy group. The evidence of thymopoiesis in the low-dose serotherapy group at 4 months again contrasts with the study by Chiesa et al. The T cell reconstitution in the low-dose serotherapy group seen in our study at 4 months post transplantation is, therefore, likely to be explained by expansion in both a thymic dependant and independent manner.",

We found the protection afforded against GvHD by lower dose serotherapy to be similar to high-dose serotherapy. In the study by Chiesa et al., 63% of patients had viral infections and 2 patients died from viral infection [32] . In our study, 35% of patients had pre-existing viral infection, and 35% developed new viral infection after CBT, with no difference between high-and low-dose serotherapy groups. This is important in the PID setting where many patients present with pre-existing viral illness. However, our definition of viral clearance and the small numbers of patients with viral infection at time of transplantation make it difficult to determine the effects of serotherapy dose on clearance of pre-existing viral infections. The influence of giving serotherapy on viral clearance in the context of PID and CBT needs further work with larger studies.",

Knutsen et al. demonstrated that in 8 patients with T cell immunodeficiencies who received the same dose of ATG (30 mg/kg/day for 3 days) CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe lymphocyte numbers increased from 3 months and there was evidence of thymopoiesis (using presence of CD4 \u00fe /CD45RA \u00fe cells as marker) from 12 to 24 months [9] . This evidence of thymopoiesis occurs later than that demonstrated by the low-dose serotherapy group in our study. Overall other studies demonstrated higher rates of GvHD grades II to IV than our study [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, these rates of GvHD are more likely to be caused by the greater number of CBT with 2 or more mismatched HLA loci, as compared with our study than the difference in serotherapy used. This, combined with the use of ATG rather than alemtuzumab, makes a direct comparison to our study difficult. There are currently limited data regarding T cell function post CBT. Proliferative responses to mitogens and viralspecific T cell function have been demonstrated as early as 2 months post CBT [9, 30, 32] . The T cell receptor repertoire has been shown to have a skewed distribution at 1 year post CBT but increased diversity as compared with BMT recipients at 2 years post HSCT [33] . Our current study shows that clinically there is good long-term immune function with independence from immunoglobulin replacement by 2 years post CBT and response to primary vaccinations independent of serotherapy dose. Our study is, however, limited to looking at numerical and not functional immune reconstitution and analysis of the effects of serotherapy on T cell functional reconstitution merits further work.",

This is because patients who did not receive serotherapy were preselected based on poor clinical condition at time of transplantation, many of whom did not receive chemotherapeutic conditioning either, or they did not receive serotherapy because they received a matched sibling donor CBT. The only factor that differed significantly between the high and low-dose serotherapy groups was that low-dose serotherapy CBT occurred more recently. This was due to a systematic change in the serotherapy policy at our unit. This would have allowed for introduction of more upto-date supportive measures in the low-dose serotherapy group, potentially influencing survival but not immune reconstitution.",
