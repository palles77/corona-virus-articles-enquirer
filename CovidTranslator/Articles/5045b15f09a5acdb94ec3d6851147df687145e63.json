These differ from one State to another but they do consider the environmental impact and human health of projects, studies or interventions in the natural environment. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this tool still barely integrates biodiversity despite the decisions of various COPs of biodiversity-related conventions 27 . Health impact studies should also be mentioned here; these can be carried out before a project is implemented, in order to study the effects on human health and the environment and alert public authorities on practices that may have an adverse effect (use of pesticides and agricultural production, water pollution). The procedure is still very diverse in different countries. In Thailand, some health impact studies are conducted by local communities and they can challenge public authorities on health issues after conducting their own investigations 28 . Finally, the WHO-supported National Environment Plans provide intersectoral planning and a multidisciplinary approach to health and environmental issues, and clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders 29 .",
