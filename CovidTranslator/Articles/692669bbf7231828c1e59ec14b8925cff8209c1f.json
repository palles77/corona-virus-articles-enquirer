In a recent longitudinal survey McNulty and Logan (1983) reported the detection of rotavirus in 79% of calves during the first 3 weeks of life and of these 80% showed no clinical signs. A similar survey carried out on children found that rotavirus shedding was detected to the same degree in children with or without diarrhoea (Barron-Romero et al., 1985) . The reasons for sub-clinical reactions to infection have not been fully elucidated, but there is experimental evidence that oral administration of antibody during virulent rotavirus infection eliminates any clinical signs of the infection (Snodgrass and Wells, 1976; Bridger and Brown, 1981) . Differences in virulence among bovine rotaviruses have also been reported (Carpio et al., 1981) but naturally occurring avirulent strains have not yet been isolated and characterised.",

Comparison of this technique with ethidium bromide staining for the detection of rotavirus ds-RNA segments showed it to be 1000-fold more sensitive, allowing the successful analysis of all the ELISA positive samples used. Herring et al. (1982) used silver staining to visualise the genome segments and reported an increase of 20-to 40-fold over ethidium bromide. However this method suffers the same problem as ethidium bromide staining in that low molecular weight segments are difficult to detect, because they both depend on the total weight of RNA present in each band whereas the 3' terminal labelling method relies on the number of molecules of each segment.",

Eight different profiles were observed and all were typical for Group A rotaviruses (Pedley et al., 1983) , except for the C7 type which was typified by the lack of a band in the Segment 11 region and the appearance of a band between Segments 6 and 7. Variation in the position of Segment 11 has been reported for Subgroups 1 and 2 of human Group A rotaviruses (Kalica et al., 1981) , although not to the extent seen with the C7 isolates. Rotaviruses with unusual genome profiles have been detected in man and animals (Pedley et al., 1983; Snodgrass et al., 1984) , but these isolates have distinct group antigens and their genome profiles lack a triplet of Segments 7, 8 and 9, having similar electrophoretic mobilities, characteristic of Group A viruses. Therefore, the detection of C7 profile viruses by a Group A specific ELISA and the presence of the 7, 8 and 9 segment triplet in their genome profiles both confirm their assignment to Group A. The detection of these viruses highlights the caution needed if genome profile analysis alone is used to assign isolates to a particular rotavirus group.",
