            "text": "The questionnaire based study gives a combined description of management, infectious diseases and reproductive performance in breeding catteries during 1 year. The mean number of cats per cattery was 6.1, and 25% of the breeders let some of their cats have free access to outdoors. Breeders reported that infection with feline panleukopenia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus or feline leukaemia virus was uncommon, but 8% of the breeders had sold or had themselves owned a cat that died of feline infectious peritonitis. Presence of conjunctivitis was reported by 33.3% of the breeders. Mean litter size was 3.7 AE 1.5, with 9.7% stillbirths and 8.3% kitten mortality week 1e12. The percentage of stillborn kittens increased with the age of the queen and litter size, and also differed among breeds. Kitten mortality differed among breeds, but did not increase with age of the queen. Seven percent of the litters were delivered by caesarean section, significantly more during winter and positively associated with presence of stillborn kittens. C at breeding is growing in popularity in Sweden and the number of registered cats within the Swedish Cat Association (SVERAK) increased by more than 100% between 1985 and 2005 (source: www.sverak.se). Today, 33 different cat breeds have been registered in Sweden, the most popular being the Norwegian Forest Cat, Birman, and Persian. Breeding cats are most often kept in groups, and usually in the home environment of the breeder. Whereas domestic cats usually accept other cats, the wild cat, which they originate from, is essentially a solitary animal. 1 As an effect of this, most breeding cats live in environments that differ markedly from the environments in which the domestic cat evolved. As environment is one of the most important factors in determining the incidence and severity of infectious disease, domestic cats might seem to suffer inordinately from infectious diseases. 2 Despite the increasing number of purebred cats many breeds are numerically small, leading to few potential breeding animals. Even relatively large breeds are often at risk of inbreeding, due to neutering of many male cats before they have mated, to avoid the behavioural changes accompanying sexual maturity. Another reason for inbreeding is the choice to breed only with animals within the owner's cattery, eg, to reduce the risk of introducing infectious diseases. In other species, inbreeding is known to have a potentially negative influence on reproductive performance, eg litter size, 3 dystocia, and stillbirths. 4 Inbreeding also affects total puppy mortality, as well as puppy mortality attributable to infection. 5 Suboptimal management, including breeding strategy, thus puts cat breeders at risk of experiencing problems with both infectious diseases and reproductive performance.",

Litter size was defined as the total number of kittens (live or stillborn) in each litter at parturition. It was treated as a continuous variable and a linear regression model was used to test the significance of possible explanatory variables. The probability of dystocia, on the other hand, was modelled using logistic regression. The probability of stillbirth and of kitten mortality for the first 12 weeks post partum were both investigated using negative binomial regression. The exposure variables in these models were the total number of kittens (live or stillborn) in the litter and number of live kittens at partus, respectively. In all, the potential covariates considered for inclusion in the initial models were: breed, season, age of queen, litter size, presence of stillborn kittens in the litter and caesarean section.

            "text": "This is the first study combining description of management, infectious diseases and reproductive performance in breeding catteries from the breeders' point of view. All data are breeder reported, and not controlled by veterinarians. The fact that the study is retrospective might negatively affect its accuracy. However, the general study period was limited to the previous year, and the recall bias should, therefore, be manageable. All breeders in the target population received a questionnaire and were thus potentially included in the study population. As expected, all did not respond, and the effect of a possible selection bias is not known. The three most common breeds in the survey were those most common in Sweden: Birman, Norwegian Forest Cats and Persian. In other studies, other breeds predominate. 10, 11, 14, 15 As several traits differ among breeds, this must be taken into account when comparing results from different studies, together with factors such as varying management practices. The mean number of cats per cattery was 6.1, and the majority of breeders kept their cats strictly indoors. However, as many as 25% let all or some of their cats have free access to outdoors. These cats are at risk of encountering infections that are not usually a problem for cats kept indoors, such as FIV. Even if only some cats in a group can roam freely, these can in turn infect the indoor cats. However, FIV is not a common infection in Sweden, and in this study no breeder had a cat tested positive for FIV the previous year. Only one breeder had a case of FeLV diagnosed in the cattery. It should be emphasised, that is not known to what extent breeders in the present study have tested their cats for FIV and FeLV. Outdoor cats are at risk of acquiring FeLV in endemic areas, especially when young, but the present study indicates that this infection route is not a major risk for breeding cats. FeLV can also be a problem in indoor cats and especially breeding animals. When introducing new cats into a household, or when mating with cats from other catteries, testing against FIV and FeLV is advisable. 16 Outdoor cats are also exposed to environmental infections, such as FPV, but none of the breeders in this survey reported a case of feline panleukopenia. One explanation for this may be that most cases of kitten mortality do not get an aetiological diagnosis. FPV has previously been shown to cause mortality in kittens in breeding catteries. 17 Another possible explanation is that effective vaccination regimes in breeding catteries reduce the risk of disease. In a previous investigation, infectious diseases were identified in 55% of kitten mortality, and 25% of all kitten mortality was due to FPV. 18 When studying kittens with viral disease, it was demonstrated that non-pedigree kittens were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of FPV than pedigree kittens. 18 Most breeders vaccinated kittens the first time at 8e10 weeks of age. All breeders vaccinated the kittens against FPV, FCV and FHV, which is in accordance with the recommendations from the Swedish Small Animal Veterinary Association and also the World Small Animal Veterinary Association that categorises these vaccines as 'core'. 19 Upper respiratory signs were frequently reported by breeders; they were reported by 19% and conjunctivitis by 33.3%, with a significant variation among breeds and the highest number in Persians and Exotics. These numbers include a potential bias, as the data are retrospective, which can lead to an underestimation, but also overestimation, of the frequency of disease. In addition, definitions may differ among breeders. C felis is an important ocular pathogen, 20 and was the single most common pathogen diagnosed in the present survey, although no diagnosis was made in the majority of cases. Even if infections with C felis can be treated successfully, extended treatment periods are required to eliminate the infection. 21 As most cases of ocular infections in catteries never get an aetiological diagnosis, it can be assumed that several cats infected with C felis are not receiving appropriate treatment, increasing the opportunity for spread of C felis and an endemic situation in catteries. This is also supported by the fact that 18% of Swedish purebred cats had antibodies to chlamydiae in a previous serosurvey. 22 The importance of cat shows for spread of infectious diseases is unclear. Although several precautions are usually undertaken to avoid spread of infections, it is an occasion with a concentration of many cats that can be subclinically infected and potentially excreting the infectious agent. In addition, when signs of infectious diseases occur, cat owners are prone to search for association with a special occasion or event, such as a show. Ectoparasites can spread, but less than 1% of breeders reported acquiring dermatophytosis after a show the previous year and ectoparasite infections were generally uncommon. In contrast, an average of 10.4% of breeders reported conjunctivitis in cats after shows, with a significant variation among breeds, and 14.6% reported other upper respiratory signs after shows. Clinical signs might be due to reactivation of latent infections, due to new infections acquired, due to noninfectious causes and may or may not be related to showing. Due to the brachycephalic anatomical conformation of Persian and Exotic breeds, they are also more prone to ocular problems and dyspnoea. 23, 24 As the diagnoses in the present survey were made by the owners, this might result in an overestimation of reports of conjunctivitis and rhinitis in these breeds. On the other hand it can be argued that owners are used to these clinical signs, and regard them as normal for the breed.",

The cause for this is unknown but, as the cat is a seasonal breeder, it is noteworthy that these are the months when the decrease in daylight culminates in Scandinavia. The risk for dystocia is also higher with the presence of a stillborn kitten, in accordance with a previous study, 15 but the causal relationship is not known. The proportion of litters delivered by caesarean section was on average 7.2%, with 90.5% of litters delivered without any medical or surgical intervention. These numbers are similar to those in previous studies. 15, 31 Maternal causes, mainly uterine inertia, are the most common causes of dystocia in cats, 32 and in brachycephalic breeds foetal malpresentation is also common. 31 The effect of litter size was in litters with only one kitten probably due to insufficient stimulation to initiate labour, while in cases with larger litters overstretching of the myometrium causing inertia is a more likely cause. Breed did not have a significant independent effect on dystocia, indicating that factors other than breed are more important risk factors for dystocia, as previously suggested by Sparkes et al. 15 Both litter size and presence of stillborn kittens were not only associated with dystocia but also differed significantly among breeds.",

The percentage of stillborn kittens increased with larger litter size, as previously described, 15 and also differed significantly among breeds. In Birman, British Shorthair and Persian/Exotic the percentage of stillborn kittens was over 10%. It has been suggested that a high proportion of stillborn kittens in Persians is related to a disproportionately high braincase that causes mechanical obstacles during the birth process. 24 The mean percentage of stillborn kittens, 9.7, in the present study is slightly higher than in previous studies. 10, 15, 30 Kitten mortality including stillborn kittens and mortality from week 1 to 12 was 18.1%, and the percentage surviving kittens at 12 weeks thus 81.9%. These values are in the same range as previously reported. 10, 15 In the cat colony studied by Root et al, 30 overall kitten mortality was higher, and only 70.1% of the kittens had survived by 8 weeks of age. As in previous studies, the majority of kitten mortality in the present study occurred during the first week after birth. As for stillbirths, kitten mortality post partum differed significantly among breeds. In Oriental Shorthair/Siamese and Persian/Exotic it was over 10%.",

Although Swedish breeding catteries are of moderate size, with a mean of six cats, FIP is a challenge to breeders: 8% had experienced this fatal disease. Despite this, measures to control FCoV infection are rarely undertaken. Breed affects several outcomes, both infectious (prevalence of conjunctivitis and URTD) and breeding parameters (litter size, stillborn kittens and kitten mortality). A careful breeding strategy should, therefore, enable both a reduction of infectious disease and an improvement of reproductive outcome.",
