It does not require a priori knowledge of potential infectious agents and is a more powerful tool than traditional viral diagnostic methods, including electron microscopy, cell culture, antigen detection, nucleic acid detection, cytology, histology, and serology [15] . Multiple viruses can be detected simultaneously, and novel or highly divergent viruses can be discovered and genetically characterized using NGS [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, on account of the low virus abundance and high background noise in clinical specimens, the clinical application of NGS in virus detection is still limited. Moreover, other limitations, such as the relatively high cost of library preparation and sequencing, complicated and tedious procedures, as well as tremendous data processing and analysis, also hinder the widespread use of NGS in clinical practice.",

Particularly, a combination method of centrifugation, filtration, nuclease treatment, and random-PCR (rPCR) showed the greatest increase in the proportion of viral sequences [26] . In addition, rPCR is a widely used and efficient method in which reverse transcription is performed by using oligonucleotides made up of random hexamers tagged with a known sequence for the enrichment of low-abundance viral nucleic acids [27] [28] [29] [30] . Recently, a substracted primer set named non-ribosomal hexanucleotides (hexanucleotides) was designed to further reduce noise for reverse transcription, and its viral enrichment ability was verified by cDNA representational difference analysis (RDA) and compared with that of random hexamers [31] . NGS-based evaluation of the viral enrichment abilities of both random hexamers and hexanucleotides is yet unreported. Directly pooling samples at the very beginning (without barcodes) or pooling individual libraries (with barcoded adaptors) for NGS may reduce sequencing costs, but the subsequent verification tests of the interested sample from pooled samples or the individual library construction of each pooled sample are rather laborious and time consuming. In addition, fragmented DNA or RNA libraries are always recommended to acquire much information from the original sample; however, the shear time is difficult to control because DNA or RNA originates from samples with different virus abundance and this treatment may increase the occurrence of artefactual recombination [32] . Moreover, the processing and analysis of tremendous NGS data is always complex, time consuming, and highly dependent on excellent professional bioinformaticians, which is impractical in many laboratories.",

We demonstrate that multiple viruses can be accurately identified from cell culture materials or clinical specimens and verify that the viral enrichment abilities of both primer sets are nearly comparative in model experiments (sequencing three representative viruses). Furthermore, direct testing of clinical specimens associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) using this improved hexanucleotide primer-based NGS approach provides further detailed genotypes of viral pathogens and identifies other potential viruses or differentiated misdiagnosis events appearing in the clinic.

After accomplishing library construction, two sequencing libraries (each containing 10 samples) were loaded onto two 316v2 chips (Life Technology) and separately sequenced on an Ion torrent PGM.

            "text": "There are some advantages of the improved NGS approach. Firstly, the procedure of library construction was simplified without the shearing step. In brief, as shown in common whole genome sequencing (WGS) [30, 44] , Virus Discovery based on cDNA Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (VIDISCA)-combined NGS [45] or virocap-combined NGS [16, 46] , these NGS protocols for library construction are usually tedious, laborious, and time consuming because every sample must be processed individually in the entire workflow. In contrast, in the improved NGS protocol, every 10 enriched products from 10 independent samples are pooled together in one tube and the mixture is regarded as a single sample for downstream processing, including end-repair, adapter ligation, size selection, library quantity, and sequencing ( Figure 1) . Importantly, the improved NGS data obtained from a fragmentation-free library may conserve the natural content of the original samples and reveal factual viral pathogen information. Some artefactual recombination may be introduced into the sheared library regardless of the enzyme digestion or sonication system used for library fragmentation [32] . Moreover, artifactual recombination in NGS generates sequence chimeras, which can affect NGS data analysis by computational pipelines to estimate nucleotide polymorphism frequency or species population diversity and generate incorrect de novo genome assembly [47] [48] . Secondly, the improved NGS approach is greatly time saving, labor saving, and cost effective. Compared with the conventional protocol (samples were processed individually throughout the NGS procedure, construction of the fragmented sequencing library was always preferred, tremendous NGS data were analyzed depending on professional bioinformaticians using expensive hardware configurations or commercial software), and the improved method spent 1/10 of the time and cost 1/10 of the capital to process a sequencing library originating from 10 independent samples. Furthermore, NGS data analysis by using in-house VIP saves further time and cost in that VIP needs minimum hardware configurations and can run on a common desktop personal computer with a 3.4 GHz Intel Core i7-4770 and 16 GB of RAM (running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), and it can be easily manipulated by someone without a background in bioinformatics. Notably, in a practical application, VIP was utilized to analyze NGS data of one unknown sample from a severe Dengue outbreak in Guangzhou, demonstrating that VIP has contributed to timely virus diagnosis (-10 min), allowing detailed virus information to be obtained in acutely ill patients, and has the potential to perform in unbiased NGS-based clinical studies that demand a short turnaround time [39] . In general, the improved approach took approximately 20 h for viral pathogens analysis of 10 samples, comprising 1.5 h for RNA extraction; 4.5 h for viral enrichment; 3 h for library construction; 8.75 h for emulsion PCR, ES, and sequencing; and 2.25 h for data analysis. Therefore, the improved NGS approach combined with in-house VIP is suitable for rapid identification of viral pathogens in clinical application, especially in emerging viral outbreaks when many samples await detection.",

Remarkably, our improved NGS-based sequence-independent amplification with hexanucleotides is more suitable for detection of viral pathogens, not only in cell culture materials but also in clinical specimens with low viral loads, than the previously reported RDA-based sequence-independent amplification with hexanucleotides, which might be restricted to infected cells that contain many copies of a virus.

The total positivity rate of HFMD-associated viral pathogens identified by NGS was 13/20, whereas 16/20 samples were detected by real-time RT-PCR, including 3 samples missed by NGS. Notablely, the viral pathogens detected from these HFMD clinical specimens were detailed typed as Coxsackievirus A6, Coxsackievirus A2, Coxsackievirus B3, and EV 71 via the improved NGS method, whereas all these samples (except EV 71) were classified as HEV without typing information by real-time RT-PCR. Thus, the improved NGS method may play an important role in accurate identification, because it can provide detailed subtype or serotype information on viral pathogens. Meanwhile, these results showed a correlation between the amount of viral RNA from real-time RT-PCR and sequencing reads from the NGS approach. This was particularly strong for Coxsackievirus A6-infected samples where the decreased CT values correlated with increased sequencing reads. This suggests that sequencing reads might be a suitable indicator of viral loads in tested samples. Besides, the prominent advantage of NGS approaches including the improved one mentioned here is that they can provide comprehensive information on samples. The NGS data from twenty clinical specimens showed that these samples contain bacteria, bacteriophage, host information (data not shown), and other viral pathogens unrecognized by specific real-time RT-PCR apart from HFMD-associated viruses. For instance, viral co-infection was detected by NGS, and though few viral sequences were captured, there were enough for identification, such as TTV, TTMV, TTMDV, bluetongue virus, and human herpesvirus in HFMD-positive samples. Interestingly, TTV, TTMV, and TTMDV were also widely found in other diseases, especially viral hepatitis [49] , asthma [50] , and severe lower respiratory tract infections [51] . Here, TTV or TTMV single or dual infection were found in two samples of mild HFMD and TTV, TTMV, or TTMDV single or dual or triple infection were found in five samples of severe HFMD. Up to now, there is little evidence of an association between the infection of TTV, TTMV, or TTMDV and HFMD, we speculate that TTV, TTMV, or TTMDV might be responsible for causing severe HFMD or exacerbating disease progression. Additionally, clinical specimen 9, which was initially diagnosed as mild HFMD in clinic and later tested HEV negative via real-time RT-PCR, was found as measles virus positive using NGS, even though the reads assigned to measles virus appeared low (598) and covered only 77.50% of the complete reference genome. We suspected that the case was probably misdiagnosed by the clinician. One of the clinical characteristics in measles patients is a maculopapular rash [52] , which is similar to the vesicular rash caused by HFMD. Thus, it is difficult to differentiate measles and HFMD at early onset. Moreover, this measles case was successfully validated via real-time RT-PCR and was further confirmed by rechecking the medical records (clinically diagnosed as measles a month later). Therefore, NGS analysis in this study demonstrated that misdiagnoses of HFMD do occur in the clinic.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, similar to other previous studies [53] [54] [55] , the shortcoming of the improved NGS approach is its low sensitivity with respect to agent-specific real-time RT-PCR assays. Here, the improved NGS approach is less sensitive than real-time RT-PCR assays, because a sample with a CT of 33 can be detected whereas one with a CT of 34 is missed, in agreement with Thorburn et al., who state that the NGS method may have a cutoff in the region of CT 32. Furthermore, the average depth of sequencing of clinical samples with low viral loads ranged from 0.02 \u00d7 to 45.48 \u00d7, far less than that of samples with high viral contents, which ranged from 48.88 \u00d7 to 126.79 \u00d7. As Lecuit et al. [56] showed, the sensitivity of a deep-sequencing approach for detecting viruses is dependent on sequencing depth. Probably, the relative low sensitivity of the improved NGS approach is attributable to the low sequencing depth of the ultra-low viral contents of clinical specimens. To address this problem, adopting higher throughput methods will probably increase the viral detection rate, such as using a 318v2 chip to replace the 316v2 chip or selecting a greater capacity sequencing platform, such as the Illumina MiSeq or Ion S5.",

However, the reads enriched by hexanucleotides from samples with low viral loads (Flu B-3 or CVA16) achieved higher sequence coverage than the results obtained by random hexamers, as seen in segments 1-8 of Flu B (range from 43.90% to 81.56% vs. 35.52% to 60.75%) and the complete CVA16 genome (93.53% vs. 85.61%). Moreover, the EBV-related sequence reads enriched by both hexanucleotides and random hexamers covered the nearly complete sequence of the membrane protein gene of EBV (98.05% vs.",
