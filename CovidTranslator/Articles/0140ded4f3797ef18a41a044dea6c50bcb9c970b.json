Douglas Miller was one of the first again to develop international initiatives in South-East Asia. ''Between 1956 and 1960, working with the Colombo Plan, he visited Singapore, Malaya, India and Thailand and, in 1960, he was Visiting Professor in Singapore''. 7 Not surprisingly, he received the Australian Honour of Knight Bachelor in 1961 for his contributions. He had a major influence on neurosurgery in Australasia in the second half of the 20th Century and I, like many others, owe much to him. Douglas Miller worked very closely with the Japanese neurosurgeons and he was a particular friend of Keiji Sano in Tokyo. At the Eighth Congress in Seoul, the Japanese neurosurgeons announced they were minting a special gold medal which was subsequently presented by myself on behalf of the Japanese neurosurgeons to Sir Douglas Miller on 1 September, 1993 in Sydney.",
