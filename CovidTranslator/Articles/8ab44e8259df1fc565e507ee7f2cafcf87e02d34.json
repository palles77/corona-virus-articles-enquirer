            "text": "9-O-Acetylation is a common natural modification on sialic acids (Sias) that terminate many vertebrate glycan chains. This ester group has striking effects on many biological phenomena, including microbe-host interactions, complement action, regulation of immune responses, sialidase action, cellular apoptosis, and tumor immunology. Despite such findings, 9-O-acetyl sialoglycoconjugates have remained largely understudied, primarily because of marked lability of the 9-O-acetyl group to even small pH variations, and/or the action of mammalian or microbial esterases. Our current studies involving 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans on glycan microarrays revealed that even the most careful precautions cannot assure complete stability of the 9-O-acetyl group. We now demonstrate a simple chemical biology solution to many of these problems by substituting the oxygen atom in the ester with a nitrogen atom, resulting in sialic acids with chemically and biologically stable 9-N-acetyl group. We present an efficient one-pot multienzyme method to synthesize a sialoglycan containing 9-acetamido-9-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac9NAc) and compare it to the one with naturally occurring 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac 2 ). Conformational resemblance of the two molecules was confirmed by computational molecular dynamics simulations. Microarray studies showed that the Neu5Ac9NAc-sialoglycan is a ligand for viruses naturally recognizing Neu5,9Ac 2 , with a similar affinity but with much improved stability in handling and study. Feeding of Neu5Ac9NAc or Neu5,9Ac 2 to mammalian cells resulted in comparable incorporation and surface expression as well as binding to 9-O-acetyl-Sia-specific viruses. However, cells fed with Neu5Ac9NAc remained resistant to viral esterases and showed a slower turnover. This simple approach opens numerous research opportunities that have heretofore proved intractable.",

            "text": "The first sialic acid discovered (crystallized by Gunner Blix from a hot mild acid extract of bovine submaxillary mucin in 1936) contained two acetyl groups, only one possibly attached to nitrogen. 1 In retrospect, Blix likely isolated a 9-O-acetyl variant of the common sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac 2 ) (1, Figure 1 ). Neu5,9Ac 2 along with Neu5Ac and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are the three most frequently occurring sialic acid forms in mammals. 2 It has long been known that 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids masks the recognition by influenza A virus hemagglutinin 3 and by other lectins such as Factor H, 4,5 CD22/Siglec-2, [5] [6] [7] and Sialoadhesin/Siglec-1, 7 while being required for the binding of influenza C virus hemagglutinin. 3, [8] [9] [10] [11] Despite such early recognition and understanding of their importance, studies of the biological significance of sialoglycans presenting this common O-acetylated form of sialic acid have lagged far behind those of the parent molecules. The reasons are many, and have been detailed elsewhere, including their lability to both acidic and basic conditions (often used in standard purification methods for glycans and glycoconjugates), their propensity to migrate from one position to another, and their relative or absolute effects in blocking sialidase action. 2, 3, 12 However, when it has been further studied, such O-acetyl group modification turns out to be a key determinant modulating recognition by viruses, 3, 13, 14 antibodies, [15] [16] [17] [18] and mammalian lectins, 6, 7, 17, 19 as well as modulating sialidase action 2,3,12 and cellular apoptosis. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Overall, exploration of the functions of Neu5,9Ac 2 and its biological and pathological interactions has been greatly hampered by the chemical instability of the O-acetyl group and/or the esterase cleavage of such a group. 8 Taken together with the fact that it is eliminated by basic conditions during conventional approaches to glycomic analysis such as beta-elimination and permethylation, it has come to the point where 9-O-acetylation tends to be simply ignored in many studies. Synthetic analogs of Neu5,9Ac 2 with chemical modifications of the 9-position of Neu5Ac generated included a 9-N-acetyl analog, 9acetamido-9-deoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac9NAc) (2, Figure 1 ), which was shown to mimic Neu5,9Ac 2 in binding to influenza C virus without being destroyed by esterase activity of the hemagglutinin-esterase. 25 This observation was not however further explored for chemical and biological studies of Neu5,9Ac 2 . Herein, we report a more efficient chemoenzymatic method for synthesizing Neu5Ac9NAc and a sialoside containing this Neu5,9Ac 2 analog. Applications in glycan microarray and cell feeding studies are presented, laying the foundation for a new approach to elucidate the important roles of 9-Oacetylation of sialic acids.",

The azide-containing glycan was analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). It was found to be pure, without any loss of OAc group. The compound was then subjected to hydrogenolysis using H 2 and Pd-C in water with a drop of glacial acetic acid. The reaction was completed in one hour as detected using MS. To minimize de-O-acetylation during the celite filtration step which uses Na 2 CO 3 as a mild base, 33 filtration after catalytic hydrogenation was replaced by passing the reaction solution through a nylon syringe filter (0.2 \u03bcm). The product was then purified using a short C-18 cartridge (water as an eluant) instead of the commonly and previously used Bio-Gel purification, as it is faster. The fractions containing the pure product were combined and lyophilized. No noticeable loss of the O-acetyl group was observed using the improved procedures described above.",

In comparison, Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (AUS) 34 treatment followed by DMB derivatization at be noted that the final synthetic product is a neutral sodium salt -earlier studies in which the acid form was prepared was associated with some de-O-acetylation, data not shown) and AUS treatment with low temperature DMB derivatization. However, about 3% loss of OAc was observed during storage in phosphate buffer (pH 8.4) at room temperature, a condition popular for current microarray printing. Furthermore, about 5% of the sialic acid was de-Oacetylated under the standard blocking condition used for glycan arrays (ethanolamine in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0). The glycan stock solution was also analyzed again after three months of storage at -20 \u00b0C and a few freeze-thaw cycles. It was noticed that another 4% of the OAc group was released over three months. Therefore, a small amount of de-Oacetylation occurred under the storage conditions and under conditions used for microarray printing and slide blocking. Any further loss of O-acetylation after printing during the binding and analysis, however, could not be directly monitored.",

Results from glycan microarray studies ( Figure 3A ) showed that hSiglec-9 prefers binding to Neu5Ac-glycan without 9-modification at sialic acid (white column), but with observable binding to both Neu5Ac9NAc (black column) and Neu5,9Ac 2 (grey column)-containing glycans. In comparison, both PToV and BCoV prefer binding to both sialoglycans with 9-modifications such as Neu5Ac9NAc and Neu5,9Ac 2 . BCoV is a known viral protein probe for 9OAc sialic acids (both Neu5,9Ac 2 and Neu5Gc9Ac) and especially 7,9-di-OAc sialic acids. 13 The more specific 9OAc-sialic acid viral probe PToV (prefers Neu5,9Ac 2 over Neu5Gc9Ac) 13 binds to both 9OAc and 9NAc glycans although it shows slightly stronger binding to the 9OAc derivative. The specific recognition of 9-modified sialic acid by esterase-inactive PToV and BCoV, the stability of 9NAc, and the esterase lability of 9OAc were evident by comparing the binding study results of esterase active PToV-treated samples ( Figure 3B ) with those non-treated ones ( Figure 3A ).",

After 3 days of feeding, BJA-B K20 cells were probed with human CD22-Fc/Siglec-2 to detect ligands ( Figure 7 ). It was found that there was a high expression of CD22 ligand when the cells were fed with Neu5Ac ( Figure 7A ). However, when the cells were grown in the presence of Neu5Ac9NAc, the expression of the CD22 ligand was minimal ( Figure 7C ). The level of CD22 ligand expressed on the cells fed with Neu5,9Ac 2 ( Figure 7B ) was between the two which could be explained by possible partial de-O-acetylation of Neu5,9Ac 2 . This supports previous observations that human CD22-Fc recognizes \u03b12-6-linked sialosides with Neu5Ac or N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) as the preferred naturally existing sialic acid form and 9-O-acetyl modification on sialic acid blocks the binding. 6, 7 In addition, it demonstrates further that Neu5Ac9NAc can be a suitable substituent for natural Neu5,9Ac 2 while has improved stability.",

The simulations were based on the GLYCAM carbohydrate force field 55 and TIP3P water model, 56 with added electrostatic parameters for describing the N-acetylation. The total length of the simulation exceeded 2 \u03bcs for each of the two sialosides studied, which has previously been noted to provide good sampling of oligosaccharide conformational degrees of freedom. 57 Figure 8 shows the results of our simulations projected onto the (\u03d5, \u03c8) dihedral angles of the glycosidic linkage between Sia and Gal. The main observation is that the conformational ensembles of the N-acetylated and O-acetylated sialosides are highly equivalent. There are three free energy basins on the positive \u03c8 half of the plot with the same shape and the relative free energies between the basins are similar to within 1 kcal/mol. The classical MD simulation approximates the effect of the chemical modification as changing the force field parameters at the acetylation site. In particular, only the partial charges on the N-acetyl functional group are modified. To test this assumption, we used density functional theory to calculate the difference in electrostatic potential as a result of changing O-acetylation to N-acetylation. 58 The results are shown in Figure 9 which confirm that the change in electrostatic potential is entirely localized to the acetylation site, which lends credence to the results of the classical simulations.",

The overall conformational ensemble is shown in the top panel of Figure 10 , and the negative-\u03c8 conformations are shown in the bottom panel, indicating that the position and orientation of Sia differ significantly between the full set vs. subset of conformations. The sialoside spends most of its time in an extended conformation, but occasionally adopts a hairpin-like structure where the C7-C9 part of Sia bends back towards Glc. These hairpin conformations were not observed in the N-acetylated ensemble. The sialosides formed few intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which suggests that the chemical modification alters the conformational ensemble via the local hydrogen bonding network of the solvent; 59 a more detailed analysis of solvent degrees of freedom is needed to test this hypothesis.",

The strategy is replacing the labile OAc group with a more stable NAc group, which otherwise behaved functionally in a generally similar manner on microarrays, incorporation into cells after feeding, and subsequent expression on cell surfaces. The single obvious difference in both the array and cell feeding studies with or without binding studies using human CD22-Fc as a probe was the general resistance of the NAc group to both viral esterases and to endogenous cellular esterases. Of course in both instances we cannot rule out a very low level of esterase cleavage, and further studies are required.",

The incorporation of the 9NAc molecules by feeding now allows one to ask if the cells become targets for infection by viruses that normally recognize the 9OAc group. Many other previously well-recognized but poorly studied biological or pathological roles of sialic acid O-acetylation may now become accessible. For example, while the disialoganglioside GD3 appears to protect cells from apoptosis, the unstable 9OAcGD3 is said to enhance apoptosis. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] If feeding of cells expressing GD3 results in expression of 9NAc-GD3, this phenomenon can now be better studied. Likewise the potential role of O-acetylation in regulating Siglec functions could also now be better explored.",

[71] [72] [73] [74] The energyminimized geometries were used as input to a restrained electrostatic potential calculation carried out using the R.E.D. server using the RESP-C2 charge model as appropriate for the GLYCAM force field. 55 In the charge optimization, the charges for the terminal hydroxyl group were kept at the initial values and all hydrogen charges set to zero. The resulting final set of charges on the N-acetyl group has a slightly different total charge from the original Oacetyl group; the charge on the carbon atom that the N-acetyl group is bonded to is increased by +0.0014, instead of the +0.008 value used for O-acetyl. An analogous calculation was carried out for the ProN 3 functional group to obtain a complete set of charges for Neu5,9Ac 2 \u03b13Gal\u03b24Glc\u03b2ProN 3 . The valence force field parameters for ProN 3 were copied over from the general AMBER force field (GAFF) 75 by comparing GLYCAM atom types to GAFF atom types.",

Monitoring turnover of incorporated Neu5,9Ac 2 (A) and Neu5Ac9NAc (B) in BJA-B K20 cells. Cells were fed for two days with 1 mM of Neu5,9Ac 2 or Neu5Ac9NAc. After two days, the feeding with Neu5,9Ac 2 or Neu5Ac9NAc was stopped and the turnover of these sugars was measured with PToV (esterase inactive) probe by flow cytometry in the course of 4 days. The expected amount of sugar was calculated based on the initial MFI (Mean Fluorescence Intensity) at day 0 and the following cell doubling. Probing Neu5Ac, Neu5,9Ac 2 or Neu5Ac9NAc-fed human lymphoma BJA-B K20 cells with CD22-Fc to detect ligands. Cells were fed for 3 days with 3 mM of Neu5Ac (solid black line), Neu5,9Ac 2 (dashed black line) or Neu5Ac9NAc (dotted line) and then stained with human CD22-Fc to detect ligands (and compared with non-fed cells, gray). The binding was analyzed by flow cytometry.

The difference between the potentials is very small, although NH group has a slightly positive potential relative to O. Figure 8 with snapshots taken 10 ps apart. These rarely seen conformations were only visited in the O-acetylated simulations but are only a small part of the ensemble, being higher in free energy.",

Even more remarkably, the di-O-acetyl form Neu5,7,9Ac 3 quickly yields a dynamic equilibrium mixture of Neu5,7,9Ac 3 and Neu5,8,9Ac 3 , in a molar ratio of \u223c1:1. Both the di-O-acetyl forms and the transient mono-8-O-acetyl form have been virtually impossible to study. While even more challenging to synthesize, N-acetyl versions of the 7,9-di-O-acetyl, 8,9-di-O-acetyl, 4,7-di-O-acetyl and 4,9-di-O-acetyl molecules that are known to occur in nature, as well as the 7,8,9-tri-O-acetyl entity, could be considered. Preparation of the NAc versions of these molecules could give the first hope of potentially understanding functions of the evanescent 8-O-acetyl group, and of differentiating between the recognition functions of 7,9 and 8,9 di-O-acetyl sialic acids,which are normally in a dynamic equilibrium state. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen if NAc analogs of such molecules recapitulate the conformation and biology of their natural counterparts, and also if they can all be efficiently incorporated by feeding the cells.",
