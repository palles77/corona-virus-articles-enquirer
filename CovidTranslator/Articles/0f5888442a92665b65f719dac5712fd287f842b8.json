The combination of natural ventilation and window can also facilitate the removal or dilution of gaseous pollutants from indoor sources in newly decorated buildings. However, the windows on the same facade may cause gaseous pollutant cross-transmission during single-sided natural ventilation between households on different floors close to the source. Although some research has focused on the pollutant cross-transmission in buildings, the simplification of windows into rectangular openings often affects accurate knowledge of pollutant transmission characteristics. Therefore, this investigation explored gaseous pollutant cross-transmission through real windows during singlesided, buoyancy-driven ventilation in a multistory building. Six types of windows were modeled for the indoor pollutant of gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was utilized to solve characteristics of pollutant transmission inside and outside the multistory building. The results indicated that the ventilation rates, thermal profiles and pollutant transmission inside and outside the building varied for each window type, although the open window areas were identical. The re-entry ratio of exhausted air entering upper floors and the infection risk of epidemic viruses caused by airborne cross-transmission was sensitive to ventilation rates and window configurations, while the sensitivities for window configurations varied case by case. The comparisons also revealed that the specification of ambient temperature and pollutant release rate ultimately did not affect the evaluation of pollutant cross-transmission using CFD.",

According to statistical data, construction and expansion are expected to continue through 2050 with 1.8 \u2212 2.0 billion m 2 of floor space every year [2] . These new buildings raise public concerns regarding indoor air quality (IAQ) associated with higher levels of pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [3] . A field survey in Hangzhou, China revealed that the average concentration of formaldehyde (HCHO) in new residential buildings after decoration is 9 times higher than the threshold from World Health Organization (WHO) [4] . The dramatic increase of HCHO in indoor environment greatly enhances the risk of exposure risk to human beings that reside in the dwelling. It is hypothesized that significant exposure to high levels of HCHO has contributed to childhood leukemia incidents in China [5, 6] . As an ordinary but effective solution, natural ventilation is being applied to remove or dilute gaseous pollutants in new decorated buildings [7] . In particular, single-sided natural ventilation is more common than cross-ventilation in practice, and can readily satisfy fire codes, security issues and privacy concerns [8] .",

It was shown that airborne transmission in certain conditions greatly contributed to the cross-infection of pandemic viruses in residential buildings [16] . With IAQ requirements, greenhouses gases deteriorating the atmosphere, and other environmental concerns, more attention should be focused to reduce pollutant cross-transmission in buildings. The airborne transmission of pollutants is often driven by three forces, namely, the buoyancy force, wind force and their combination [17] . Niu and Tung [16] employed carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) as tracer gases to measure the amount of the exhausted air re-entering upper floor windows due to buoyancy effects. It was found that up to 7% of the exhausted air from the lower floor transferred to the adjacent upper floor. Liu et al. [18] numerically investigated the airborne transmission in a high-rise building with buoyancy-driven ventilation. The results revealed that the windows flush with the building facade became major paths of pollutant cross-transmission. To reduce pollutant transmission between floors, Wu and Niu [19] installed a mechanical exhaust system in each room with single-sided, buoyancy-driven ventilation. It was shown that the outflow through the window was weakened when the mechanical exhaust was employed. If the mechanical exhaust rate was large enough, no indoor air escaped through the window. The two-way airflow through the window turned into one-way inflow, and thus re-entry risk was avoided. Lim et al. [20, 21] further confirmed the possibility of pollutant transmission from lower floors to upper floors through buoyancy-driven airflow by means of field measurement and numerical analysis in a hospital setting. Considering the variety of indoor pollutants, Gao et al. [22] utilized Lagrangian and Eulerian models to simulate particulate (pollutant) transmission between adjacent floors. It was concluded that the upward transmission closely depended on the size of the particulate. If the particulate sizes were larger than 20 m, the upward transmission was limited by gravitational settling effects. Compared to pollutant cross-transmission by buoyancy-driven airflow, wind-driven airflow is more complex because of the random nature of wind. Liu et al. [23] [24] [25] measured pollutant transmission and possible cross-infection based on a 1:30 scale model of a 10-story residential building in a wind tunnel. Experimental results indicated that vertical (bidirectional) and horizontal cross-transmission between adjacent flats were both observed. Furthermore, the impacts of transient characteristics of wind on pollutant cross-transmission should be considered when evaluating the risk of cross-infection. To perform accurate numerical predictions on indoor pollutant dispersion around a building, Liu et al. [26] compared three turbulence models based on a high-rise building with 33 floors and 8 units in a prescribed wind field. Obvious differences were observed among the turbulence models, and the simulations based on the realizable k \u2212 \u03b5 model agreed best with experiments. Ai et al. [27] [28] [29] used the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model and the large eddy simulation (LES) model to quantify the dispersion of pollutants during wind-dominated conditions inside and outside a typical multistory building. The results indicated that the incident wind and the balcony created significant changes in the route of airborne transmission and the re-entry ratio of exhaust air.",

Gao et al. [30] considered the combination of forces for pollutant cross-transmission in a high-rise building with single-sided natural ventilation. It was found that the wind could reinforce or suppress vertical cross-transmission of pollutants between floors, which was mainly attributed to wind speed and direction. Mao et al. [31] further extended the research in a 33-story building with closed doors and windows. The pollu- tant cross-transmission between floors was driven by buoyancy and wind effects together. The multi-zone model was developed to analyze pollutant spread in vertical and horizontal directions. The pollutant concentration on the upper floors was 3 \u2212 4 orders of magnitude lower than that on the floor where the source was located. Though the research on pollutant cross-transmission via combined forces has been investigated, it is still far from being fully understood since the characteristics of airflow resulting from the interaction between buoyancy and wind has not been well explained [32] .",

Due to the complex features of airflow inside and outside buildings, there are very few studies that investigate the impact of window configuration; real windows are simplified as rectangular openings. Our previous study demonstrated that there are significant thermal flow differences in natural ventilation with various window configurations [33] , which should also affect pollutant cross-transmission accordingly. Therefore, the investigation herein aims to quantify gaseous pollutant cross-transmission in a multistory building with single-sided, buoyancy-driven ventilation through variable window types.

Based on the airflow predicted by the mathematical models introduced above, one can continue to solve another equation to obtain characteristics of pollutant transmission in indoor and outdoor environment. Generally, there are two methods for modeling pollutant transmission, i.e., the Eulerian method and the Lagrangian method. The Lagrangian method is usually applied to transiently track particle pollutants. Under steady state conditions, both methods can provide reasonable results, while the Eulerian method requires less computing time than the Lagrangian method [37] . Since the densities of air and gaseous HCHO are similar, they can be considered as a passive pollutant. Therefore, the Eulerian method is suitable to quantify passive pollutant transmission.

The dimensions of the test chamber have a length of 2.5 m, width of 3.5 m and height of 3.2 m. The dimension of the environmental chamber exceeds that of the test chamber, but the specific size of the environmental chamber was not provided. A vertical slide window with a 1.23 m width and 1.48 m height was located on the front wall of the test chamber. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) was the tracer gas and was injected into the test chamber with the window closed before measurements were taken. The tracer gases of CO 2 and SF 6 are the most frequently applied tracer gases in ventilation measurements, which are both colorless gases with densities larger than that of air [43, 44] . The test chamber was heated by an electrical heating unit. Once CO 2 concentrations reached 4000 ppm inside the test chamber and the temperature difference between the two chambers was 8 \u2022 C, CO 2 injection and electrical heating ceased, the window was opened and the measurements began. CO 2 concentration in the center of the test chamber at different heights was measured during the buoyancy-driven ventilation. Fig. 4(b) -(e) compare the computed CO 2 concentration with the experimental data at different heights at the center of the test chamber. Due to the lack of information of the environmental chamber, two types of boundary conditions were tested with the CFD modeling. One condition assumed that the upper surface of the computational domain was open to ambient conditions and pressure was specified (BC-open). The second condition assumed that the upper surface of the computational domain was a no-slip wall (BC-close). As shown in Fig. 4(b) -(e), the CO 2 concentration generally decreases with time during ventilation. Compared to the decay of CO 2 at y = 2.8 m, the CO 2 concentration at y = 0.4 m decreases faster at the initial stage (t = 0 \u2212 800s). The concentration of CO 2 predicted by the CFD model is in good agreement with experimental data at the initial stage. However, the CFD predictions gradually deviate from measurements as the time continues. The CFD predic-tions suggest that the boundary condition that specified ambient pressure is more similar to the experimental conditions. Although neither boundary condition tested perfectly agrees with the experimental data, and not knowing the exact experimental conditions, the CFD modeling can be considered reliable.",

When the no-slip boundary (close) is employed at the top of the external domain, the CO 2 exhausted from the test chamber cannot be removed from the external domain, increasing the CO 2 background concentration. However, the CO 2 exhausted from the test chamber can be removed from the external domain over time if the ambient boundary (open) is specified at the top of the external domain, thus maintaining a lower CO 2 concentration. Owing to that, the size of external domain highly affects the background concentration of CO 2 entering into the test chamber. Unfortunately, the dimension of the environmental chamber was not given in the experiment [42] . Nevertheless, it is reasonable to use the scalar transport equation to predict gaseous pollutant transmission via buoyancy-driven airflow.",

As illustrated in the pollutant profiles of Fig. 5 , the indoor velocity, concentration and mass flow rate generally increase when the ambient temperature decreases, while the indoor temperature shows an opposite variation. The pollutant distribution on the first floor and the two upper floors differ greatly because the pollutant source is located in the center of the first floor room. The concentration around the pollutant source is the largest, and the maximum concentration on each floor appears at the height of air inflow, as shown in Fig. 5(c) . The comparison demonstrates that ambient temperature does not produce an obvious impact on the basic characteristics of thermal flow and concentration profiles. To compare the results with our previous research [33] and subsequently determine the best window configuration that minimizes cross-transmission, the ambient temperature is specified as 20 \u2022 C in the remainder of the study. Fig. 6 compares the computed concentration profiles with different release rates of the HCHO source for the VSW case (A 2 = 0.8733 m 2 , T \u221e = 20 \u2022 C). The average concentration of HCHO inside the building obviously increases with increasing release rate for each floor, as shown in Fig. 6(a) . Since the HCHO source is located on the first floor, the average concentration inside shows the most drastic response to the variation of the release rate. According to the threshold for indoor HCHO suggested by WHO (81 ppb), the average concentration in the first floor room is 1.4 \u2212 13.1 times the threshold. As introduced by Guo et al. [4] , the HCHO level in new residential buildings after decoration was found to be over 9 times higher than the threshold. Therefore, modeled a pollutant source of 80 g/s for the VSW case (A 2 ) can best represent the real condition based on the WHO threshold. The average concentrations for the second and the third floor are 62 ppb and 11 ppb in the case of I = 80 g/s, which are 0.77 and 0.15 times the threshold, respectively. If the release rate of the source pollutant increases slightly, the HCHO concentration in the second floor room may be over the threshold, and the level in the third floor room will become worse as well. Therefore, human beings on the upper floor adjacent to the first floor (with the pollutant source) in the multistory building risk cross-infection during single-sided natural ventilation. Fig. 6(b) presents the dimensionless concentration profiles along a line through the center of the rooms and corresponds to different release rates of the HCHO source. Most notably, the profiles collapse and demonstrate that the trends do not change, irrespective of release rate; only the magnitudes change for the raw data. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the specification of the pollutant release rate will not affect obtaining basic characteristics of gaseous pollutant cross-transmission in the multistory building.",

            "text": "As defined by ASHRAE Handbook [45] , the air change rate per hour (ACH) compares the airflow rate Q to the volume of the corresponding space (i.e., ACH = Q/ ). As shown in Fig. 7 (a) \u2212 (c), the ACH for each floor increases with increasing open area for each window type. The ventilation performances of each window type on the first and second floor are very similar, and minor differences are present on the third floor. In general, the VSW and HPW perform best in terms of ventilating the multistory building, followed by the TURN, VPW and TILT. The AW style always performs the worst among the six window types except when the window open area is less than 0.5 m 2 on the first floor, and then TILT performs the worst as shown in Fig. 7(a) . On the second and third floor of the multistory building, the performance of the TILT is better than that of the AW owing to the upward airflow in front of the facade induced by the plane of the TILT, as shown in Fig. 7(b) and (c) . On the first floor of the multistory building, the performances of the TILT and AW are more similar and change with the open area of the window. These findings are consistent to our previous work on ventilation performances of various window types in a one-story building, as shown in Fig. 7(d) [33] . Fig. 8 presents the average HCHO concentration for each floor comparing open area. The average HCHO concertation decreases with increasing open area for each window type. Note that the maximum values along the abscissa are different in Fig. 8 because the first floor levels are significantly higher and the third floor levels are significantly lower. However, the pollutant concentrations on a particular floor with different window types show pronounced differences on the second floor, although the open window areas and release rates of HCHO are equal. This can be attributed to the window style that impacts ventilation rates. As shown in Fig. 8 , the average concentration of HCHO for the HPW case in each floor is not the smallest among the six window cases. However, the corresponding ventilation rate for the HPW case is still the largest, as shown in Fig. 7 . Therefore, the window configuration affects the pollutant transmission between floors in multistory buildings. The HCHO concentration decays with increasing floor level with the same window type. From the first floor to the second floor to the third floor, the average HCHO concentration can reach magnitudes of 100 \u2212 1000, 10 \u2212 100 and 10, respectively. Clearly, the performance of various windows on preventing airborne pollutant re-entering upper floors are different. Among the six window types, the VPW, TILT and TURN styles generally do not perform well and thus does not adequately restrict the pollutant from re-entering upper floors. In contrast, the VSW and HPW styles perform better but the AW style presents the best performance on restricting pollutant cross-transmission, although it is not able to provide larger ventilation rates.",

As shown in Fig. 9 , the HCHO profiles inside and outside the building are sensitive to window styles. By considering the configurations of the VSW and HPW styles, the TURN, VPW and TILT styles present similar characteristics of HCHO distributions because similar transmission paths are created by windows. Among the six windows, the AW style performs the best with low pollutant transmission since the upward airflow is prevented by the window pane. In contrast, the TILT, TURN and VPW styles are not as effective in reducing pollutant cross transmission because the window pane does not redirect the flow. Therefore, the HCHO concentrations in the upper floor rooms for these three window cases are relatively higher. The HCHO concentration reduces by nearly one order of magnitude between the first floor (with the pollutant source) and the upper floors for each window style, while the reduction between the second floor and the third floor is much less than that between the first floor (with the pollutant source) and the upper floors.",

Among the six window types, the AW style shows the best performance for restricting pollutant cross-transmission, although it is not able to provide larger ventilation rates. The VSW and HPW styles perform adequately, and the VPW, TILT and TURN types perform the worst. Considering the performances of each window and the characteristics of pollutant distribution, only the thermal flow profiles corresponding to VSW, AW and TURN are presented. The velocity streamlines near the windows provide a visual understanding of how the pollutant transports through the openings. The upward flow is obviously restricted by the window pane in the AW case, controlling the exhausted pollutant from re-entering the upper floors, as shown in Fig. 10(b) . The TURN style directs the air toward the window opening such that the air exhausted from each floor cascades along the facade and thus enhances the air re-entering the upper floors, as shown in Fig. 10(c) . Compared to the TURN case, the air path passing through each floor window is better separated in the VSW case, so the indoor pollutant cross-transmission is reduced as well, as shown in Fig. 10(a) . The thermal flow profiles for the VSW provides the best ACH ventilation rates, and the overall mean velocity is higher and the temperature is lower than the other cases. The TURN case performs adequately but the velocity field demonstrates reduced circulation, and thus lower ACH but the temperatures are reasonable.",

Fig. 11 presents the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air from the source floor entering the upper floors. As shown in Fig. 11 , the reentry ratio for the second floor is generally larger than that for the third floor because of the smaller transmission distance from the pollutant source. In the second floor room, the re-entry ratios for HPW and TURN cases increase progressively with the ACH, while that for the VSW case exhibits a monotonic decrease. In contrast, the re-entry ratios for the TILT and VPW cases fluctuate with ACH, but the re-entry ratio for the AW case remains constant with ACH. Similarly, various window types are not able to present consistent behaviors in re-entry ratios in the third floor room. Notice that the TILT style always presents the largest re-entry ratio among the six windows, which is most likely because the upward airflow is not restricted by the structure of the window itself. Moreover, the window pane is angled toward the indoor environment and induces the pollutant to re-enter. Thus, the window configurations should be carefully considered for cross-transmission, especially in the control of cross-infection of pandemic virus via airborne transmission, as well as acceptable ventilation. Fig. 11 . Based on the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air entering the upper floors, the infection risk of a pandemic virus via airborne transmission can be estimated by the Wells-Riley equation [46] . The Wells-Riley model was initially proposed in an epidemiological study on measles outbreak, which was based on the quantum theory of infection. A quantum was defined as the number of airborne pathogens required to infect a person. By considering the intake dose of airborne pathogens in terms of the number of quanta to evaluate the probability of escaping the infection, the Wells-Riley equation is derived as [46] [47] [48] ,",

Notice that the Wells-Riley equation was originally applied to evaluate the risk of infection for one room. When it is applied to assess the risk of crossinfection in a multistory building with several rooms, the quantum generation rate for the receptor rooms can be determined based on the re-entry ratio [30, 49] . Therefore, the Wells-Riley equation is rewritten as, The quantum generation rate r in Equation (15) cannot be directly obtained, which is generally estimated from a specific outbreak case of pandemic virus. The breathing rate and the exposure time t 0 can be specified based on the detailed information of infectors. In our study, the parameters n, r, and t 0 are speci-fied according to the work by Gao et al. [30] . In their study [30] , the infection risk in a high-rise building with single-sided ventilation driven by the combination of wind and buoyancy forces was assessed. To illustrate the differences of the infection risk caused by different forces, the parameters for our present study are n = 1, r = 13 quanta/h, = 0.6 m 3 /h, t 0 = 8 h. It is assumed that an infector stands in the center of the first floor room, and the virus transmission is between the source floor and the second floor and between the source floor and the third floor. Fig. 12 presents the relationship of infection risk versus ACH for different floors. As shown in Fig. 12(a) , the infection risks for different window configurations are almost identical in the first floor room due to the amount of virus released by the infector. However, the infection risks for window styles on the second and third floors are different from each other. Obviously, the infection risks for TILT, VSW and VPW cases are relatively higher when the ACH is small in the second floor room. With increasing ACH, the differences between window styles gradually decrease, as illustrated in Fig. 12(b) . On the third floor, the infection risk for each window style further decreases the re-entry ratio of the exhausted air, as shown in Fig. 12(c) . Fig. 12 (d) presents the infection risk in the case of airborne transmission driven by a combination of buoyancy and wind forces determined by Gao et al. [30] . As shown in Fig. 12(d) , the infection risks in the floor room where the infector is located (i.e., source floor) and the receptor room (i.e., upper floor) present similar orders of magnitudes to our study. On the source floor, the infection risk decreases with increasing ACH although ambient wind is considered in Gao et al., which is the same as our findings on the first floor (i.e., source floor). The largest risk of infection is 6.6% on the upper floor when the wind is 2 m/s, which corresponds to the highest re-entry ratio of the exhausted air but does not correspond to the smallest ACH. Therefore, the wind in practical conditions may either reinforce or suppress the pollutant cross-transmission. To represent realistic performances of window configurations on cross-transmission, the incident wind must be carefully considered in future research.",
