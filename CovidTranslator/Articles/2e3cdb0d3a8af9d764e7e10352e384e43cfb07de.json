Objectives: Since most bronchiolitis studies fail to detect any viral pathogen in part of the samples, we sought for the presence of hMPV in a well characterized bronchiolitis cohort. Study design: Nasal washes were obtained from 56 children admitted to the hospital for acute bronchiolitis. RNA extraction and subsequent RT-PCR were used to detect hMPV, and correlated the presence of the virus with clinical characteristics of the disease. Results and conclusions: PCR revealed the presence of hMPV in 16% of bronchiolitis cases, whereas respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 67.9%) was the most frequently encountered viral pathogen. hMPV was identified either as a unique viral pathogen or co-existed with RSV, with whom they shared a similar seasonal distribution. There were no differences in disease characteristics, either clinical or laboratory, between bronchiolitis cases where hMPV was present and those caused by RSV or other viral pathogens.",

            "text": "A new respiratory virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), has been recently isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirates of young children in the Netherlands (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . hMPV is the first human respiratory pathogen classified as a member of the Metapneumovirus genus, which together with Pneumoviruses constitute the Pneumovirinae subfamily within the Paramyxoviridae family (van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Boivin et al., 2002; Viazov et al., 2003) . The clinical symptoms of the children from which the virus was isolated ranged from upper respiratory airway disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . Subsequent studies established the association of this virus with acute RTIs in all age groups (Maggi et al., 2003; Osterhaus and Fouchier, 2003; Boivin et al., 2003; Vicente et al., 2003; Stockton et al., 2002; Boivin et al., 2002; Peiris et al., 2003; Freymouth et al., 2003) . However, several epidemiological as well as clinical aspects of hMPV infection are still to be firmly established and in this context the analysis of well defined respiratory disease cohorts is of particular importance (Jartti et al., 2002; Rawlinson et al., 2003) . We hypothesized that hMPV may be an important pathogen in the context of acute bronchiolitis of infancy. In addition to bronchiolitis cases being reported within the patients of published hMPV studies, this is further suggested by the observation that most bronchiolitis studies fail to identify a pathogen in a considerable proportion of cases.",

Reverse transcription was performed at 37 \u2022 C in a 50 mM Tris-HCl, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 buffer containing 10 mM DTT, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 0.5 g random hexamer primers and 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Superscript TM , Invitrogen). cDNA was stored at \u221220 \u2022 C until used. Primers (upper MPVNF: 5 AGGCCCTCAGCACCAGACA3 ; lower MPVNR: 5 TTGACCGGCCCCATAAGC3 ) were designed against the N (nucleocapsid) region of the 00-1 isolate of hMPV (Genbank accession Nr. AF371337.2) to amplify a 318 bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 505-822 of the published hMPV genome (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . PCR reaction was conducted in the presence of 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 400 M dNTPs, 0.25 M of each MPV primer and 2.5 units Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) for 40 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 40 s, 55 \u2022 C for 40 s and 72 \u2022 C for 1 min. Subsequently, 20% of the PCR reaction volume was run in a 1.8% agarose gel and, when present, 318 bp amplicons were excised and further purified with the Concert Rapid Gel Extraction System kit (GibcoBRL), according to the manufacturers' instructions. Selected samples were vacuum dried and sequenced using the MWG AG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) sequencing facilities. Comparison of the sequenced fragments to the hMPV genome was done by submission to the Genbank using the standard nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST (blastn), whereas comparison between individual amplicons was conducted using blast2.",
