The present study examined the relationship between Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection and three lectins: DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin). Expression of DC-SIGNR resulted in robust JEV proliferation in a lymphoid cell line, Daudi cells, which was otherwise non-permissive to infection. DC-SIGN expression caused moderate JEV proliferation, with effects that varied according to the cells in which JEV was prepared. LSECtin expression had comparatively minor, but consistent, effects, in all cell types used in JEV preparation. While DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR-mediated JEV infection was inhibited by yeast mannan, LSECtin-mediated infection was inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine b1-2 mannose. Although involvement of DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR in infection seems to be a common characteristic, this is the first report on usage of LSECtin in mosquitoborne flavivirus infection.",

While it is known that MVEV and SLEV cause encephalitis, by gaining access to neurons in the central nervous system through the infection of an olfactory nerve or the penetration of the blood-brain barrier, the molecular mechanisms of MVEV/SLEV infection of cells such as DCs, lymph nodes, visceral organs, nerves, and blood endothelium remain unknown. In the case of JEV, histopathological changes are observed in the lung, kidney, and liver of JE patients [4] , but there is no evidence that JEV follows an infectious sequence in the human body that is similar to that of MVEV or SLEV in rodents.",

Usage of DC-SIGN in viral infection has been reported for WNV [8] , DV [9] [10] [11] , and other viruses. Furthermore, nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the DC-SIGNencoding gene are associated with the severity of diseases caused by DV [12] , indicating an important role of DC-SIGN in DV pathogenesis. Given that WNV and DV are mosquito-borne viruses, the use of DC-SIGN as a receptor is most likely to occur following a mosquito bite, when the immature DCs residing in the skin become infected. It is also reported that the two viruses use DC-SIGNR [8, 11] , which shares 77 % amino acid sequence identity with DC-SIGN, to infect the endothelium of lymph nodes and liver sinusoids [7] . Liver sinusoidal endothelial cell lectin (LSECtin) is a recently-identified C-type lectin [13] that is involved in the infections of a number of viruses, including filoviruses, SARS coronavirus, Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [14] [15] [16] .",

The primate cells were infected with JEV prepared in mosquito cells (C6/36), at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02. With the exception of the Daudi cells, JEV titers in the cell lines reached over 10 6 plaque-forming units (PFUs)/ml by 72 hours postinfection (hpi; Fig. 1 ). In contrast, JEV was undetectable in Daudi cells during the culture period ( Fig. 1 ; the detection limit is 5 PFUs/ml). Daudi cells were thus selected for use as a non-permissive host for the following experiments, which tested the role of exogenously expressed C-type lectins.",

As expected, Daudi cells expressing any of the three lectins showed an increase in JEV antigen-positive cell numbers after inoculation with C6/36-derived JEV (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, the increase was highest in DC-SIGNR-expressing Daudi cells, Titer (PFU/ml) followed in order by DC-SIGN-and LSECtin-expressing cells (Fig. 3A) . This is consistent with the JEV growth curves in Daudi cells during the early phase at 12-36 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . The results described above (Figs. 2, 3A) suggested that the degree of JEV proliferation in the inoculated cells was not only dependent on the specific lectin expressed, but also on the cell line that had been used to prepare JEV. Consequently, JEV was grown for use in infection in three mammalian cells: Vero9013 (monkey), A549 (human), and 293 (human). The results were generally similar when C6/ 36-derived JEV was compared with Vero9013-and A549derived JEVs (Fig. 3B, C) . When 293-derived JEV was used, both DC-SIGN and LSECtin expression resulted in an increase in the number of antigen-positive Daudi cells, but the effect was the opposite of that observed for infection with JEV derived from C6/36, Vero9013, and A549 cells. LSECtin-expressing Daudi cells showed a greater increase in the number of antigen-positive cells than DC-SIGN-expressing Daudi cells when infected with JEV derived from 293 cells (Fig. 3D) . However, when infected with JEV derived from C6/36, Vero, and A549 cells, LSECtin-expressing Daudi cells showed less of an increase in the number of antigen-positive cells than DC-SIGNexpressing Daudi cells in each of three independent experiments (Fig. 3A-C) Comparison of surface proteins of JEV grown in C6/36 and 293 cells",

Western blotting with Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) lectin, which binds high-mannose N-glycan structures, detected proteins with a molecular weight (MW) of approximately 50 kDa (Fig. 4A) .

As shown in Fig. 5C , DC-SIGN-and DC-SIGNR-mediated infection was dramatically reduced by treatment with mannan, but not Glc-NAcb1-2Man. In contrast, LSECtin-mediated infection was reduced by treatment with GlcNAcb1-2Man, but not mannan (Fig. 5C) . Thus, it is likely that the effects of DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR on JEV infection were due to the enhanced binding of JEV on lectin-expressing cells via specific carbohydrates. Although binding of the virus to LSECtin-expressing cells was not detected, the observed inhibition of infection by GlcNAcb1-2Man strongly suggested that the effect of LSECtin on JEV infection was caused by a direct interaction with a specific carbohydrate(s) on JEV surface proteins.",

JEV has two surface glycoproteins, the major protein E and the minor protein prM [1] . To our knowledge, all but one of the JEV isolates whose E-and prM-encoding sequences have been determined have one N-glycosylation motif in each deduced peptide sequence. The one known exception is Indonesia isolate JKT6468, which harbors two motifs in its predicted prM protein [25] . Furthermore, in the present study, the JEV-infectionenhancing effects of three C-type lectins (DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, and LSECtin) were inhibited by cognate carbohydrates. Thus, even though only a single JEV isolate was used, the involvement of the three C-type lectins in JEV infection reported here can likely be considered to be a general characteristic of JEV.",

In the case of WNV and DV, DC-SIGN usage has been shown to be Usage of C-type lectins by Japanese encephalitis virus 2029 strongly related to cell origin. Insect-cell-derived, but not mammalian-cell-derived, viruses efficiently use DC-SIGN in infection. This difference is caused by carbohydrate modifications that differ according to the origin of the virus-producing cells [8, 26] . One exception is that WNV grown in Vero cells uses DC-SIGN [8] . In the present study, JEV prepared in an insect cell line used DC-SIGN efficiently, as did JEV prepared in some mammalian cell lines (including Vero and A549). Usage of DC-SIGN by mammalian-cell-derived JEV (Fig. 3B, C) The prM protein does not seem to be significantly involved in DC-SIGN usage, due to the lack of a high-mannose structure and its absence within the JEV virion. DC-SIGN is expressed in immature DCs and a subpopulation of macrophages [7] . Our finding that insect-cellderived JEV efficiently binds to and infects DC-SIGNexpressing cells, suggests that JEV injected by mosquito bites goes toward DC-SIGN-expressing DCs/macrophages in the skin as a first target of infection, which is similar to WNV and DV [8, 26] . DC-SIGNR is typically detected in liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells and in alveolar and placental endothelial cells [7, 28] . Our results indicate that such cells can be highly susceptible to JEV infection produced from a range of hosts and cell types, and therefore that they might be major replication sites for JEV before brain invasion in vivo. Abortion and histopathological changes in the liver and lung caused by infection [4] , virus isolation from the liver and placenta [29] , and placenta susceptibility to infection in vitro [30] may occur due to the distribution of DC-SIGNR. Liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells also express LSECtin [13] , which was shown by the authors to enhance JEV infection. The infection-enhancing effects of DC-SIGNR and LSECtin were mediated by distinct N-glycans, highmannose and GlcNAcb1-2Man, respectively. Thus, in the case of JEV infection, the two lectins are able to function synergistically on liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells.",

However, because the glycan structures and glycosylation levels exhibited by tumor cells frequently differ from those of normal cells[27], DC-SIGN usage by mammalian-cellderived JEV/WNV might not be observed in vivo. Studies with primary cell cultures from various human organs will be required to better characterize the effects of carbohydrate modifications on viral infectivity. Nevertheless, the carbohydrate status of the viral surface proteins of JEV prepared in insect C6/36 cells and mammalian 293 cells was tentatively compared to clarify their relationship to DC-SIGN usage. The results that were obtained suggest that while DC-SIGN usage by JEV is mediated by highmannose structures on the E protein, the interaction between DC-SIGN and high-mannose structures could have been inhibited by structural hindrance of other modifications of the E protein or other unknown mechanisms.",
