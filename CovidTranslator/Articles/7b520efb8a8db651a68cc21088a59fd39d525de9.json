            "text": "Rotavirus in infant-toddler day care centers: Epidemiology relevant to disease control strategies Alfred V. Bartlett infection was conducted concurrently in infants and toddlers in day care centers (DCCs) and in a large pediatric clinic in Houston. The mean number of children in the DCCs was 223; the diarrhea rate during the first 12 months was 2.62 episodes per child-year. Rotaviru s accounted for approximately 10% of the total episodes of diarrhea in the pediatric clinic and DCC populations, but 50% during the winter months. The occurrence of RV in the DCCsparal!eled that seen in thepediatric clinic. Theannual rate of RV infection in DCCs wa s 0.55 episodes per child-year, with diarrhea occurring in only 40% of the episodes (0.22 episodes per child-year). There were 45 diarrhea outbreaks in DCCs, for a mean of 3.8 per center per year; nine of these outbreaks were associated with RV. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of RNA genome patterns of RV strains from eight of these outbreaks showed that in seven outbreaks a single strain was identified in children in that DCC, Whereas multiple strains were identified simultaneously in the community. The age distributions of sYmptomatic and asymptomat!c RV infections in DCC study children were not significantly different. In symptomatic RV-infected children in DCCs, 42% had RV identified in stool specimens within 2 days before diarrllea occurred. Thirty-eight DCC children had more than one episode of RV infection, but only five had two symptomatic RV infections. Diarrhea caused by RV is common in children in DCCs, often occurs in outbreaks due tothe same strain, and parallels disease in the community; asymptomatic RV infection is also common in children in DCCs. We performed a prospective longitudinal study i n Houston infant-toddler DCCs of the incidence of RV infection and diarrhea, the temporal pattern of RV in these DCCs compared With RV illness in the community, patterns of entry and transmission in the DCC child groups, and the role of asympt0matic RV infection in these groups. We also conducted a concurrent clinic-based study 9 of diarrhea and R V in a large pediatric clinic representing a broad cross-section of Houston children comparable to those attending study DCCs.",

Our simultaneous DCC and HMO pediatric clinic surveillance found the temporal patterns of RV diarrhea to be similar in the two settings.

Given the estimated 4-day mean shedding duration of asymptomatic RV infections, we may have failed to detect 43% of such infections. Thus the rate of asymptomatic RV could actually be almost twice that identified, and some detected infections might have been secondary to unidentified asymptomatic infections. On the other hand, our increasing the testing frequency after identifying RV in a group could identify infections more effectively and result in an apparently higher rate of secondary infections. However, our electrophoresis findings are more consistent with intergroup transmission of RV than with simply increased detection of RV present in the DCCs and the community.",

However, we have no information on the RV infection history of these children before they entered surveillance. We did find a shorter duration of symptoms in older children, and in five RV diarrhea episodes following previous RV diarrhea episodes in the same children. In addition, 10 of 38 sequentially infected children had asymptomatic infection after earlier symptomatic episodes. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that older children have increased resistance to illness during RV infection; immunization by naturally occurring RV infection may be one mediator of this increased resistance.",

Additional impact on diarrheal disease in child care settings will require improved hygiene, specific strategies to control other pathogens, and small group size. 3,4,27",
