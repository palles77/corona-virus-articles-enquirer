Blom (1982) reported that the annual calf mortality between day 2 and 180 was 7% in Danish dairy Veterinary Microbiology 137 (2009) [165] [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] Trans-tracheal aspirations from 56 apparently healthy calves and 34 calves with clinical signs of pneumonia were collected in six different herds during September and November 2002. The 90 samples were cultivated and investigated by PCR tests targeting the species Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma dispar, and Mycoplasma bovirhinis. A PCR test amplifying the lktC-artJ intergenic region was evaluated and shown to be specific for the two species M. haemolytica and Mannheimia glucosida. All 90 aspirations were also analyzed for bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 virus, and bovine corona virus by antigen ELISA. Surprisingly, 63% of the apparently healthy calves harbored potentially pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract, 60% of these samples contained either pure cultures or many pathogenic bacteria in mixed culture. Among diseased calves, all samples showed growth of pathogenic bacteria in the lower respiratory tract. All of these were classified as pure culture or many pathogenic bacteria in mixed culture. A higher percentage of the samples were positive for all bacterial species in the group of diseased animals compared to the clinically healthy animals, however this difference was only significant for M. dispar and M. bovirhinis. M. bovis was not detected in any of the samples. BRSV was detected in diseased calves in two herds but not in the clinically healthy animals. Among the diseased calves in these two herds a significant increase in haptoglobin and serum amyloid A levels was observed compared to the healthy calves. The results indicate that haptoglobin might be the best choice for detecting disease under field conditions. For H. somni and M. haemolytica, a higher percentage of the samples were found positive by PCR than by cultivation, whereas the opposite result was found for P. multocida. Detection of P. multocida by PCR or cultivation was found to be significantly associated with the disease status of the calves. For H. somni a similar association with disease status was only observed for cultivation and not for PCR.",

In Denmark, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and coronavirus are the most common viral agents found in relation to calf pneumonia (Larsen et al., 1999) . Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Arcanobacterium pyogenes are the bacteria most commonly isolated from calf pneumonia (Tegtmeier et al., 1999) . Several Mycoplasma species have been isolated in Denmark from bovine lungs.

In addition, the serum concentrations of haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA) were determined to describe the correlation between the presence of infectious agents and acute phase protein response. In order to avoid contamination from bacteria resident in the upper respiratory tract, the sampling was performed by trans-tracheal aspiration. This method has been recommended as optimal for evaluation of the microbiological status of the lower respiratory tract in order to elucidate the etiology of pneumonia in an animal (Espinasse et al., 1991; Rebbun, 1995; Virtala et al., 1996; Pommier, 1999; Pommier and Wessel, 2002) . Finally, an aim was to evaluate whether PCR tests are suitable for obtaining a reliable and quick diagnosis of pneumonia related to bacterial pathogens.",

Clinical disease was defined as a rectal temperature above 39.5 8C in connection with nasal discharge, coughing, or an unprovoked respiration frequency higher than 40 min \u00c01 . The age of the calves ranged from 14 days to 4 months. The average age of the clinically healthy calves sampled in September was 2.1 months (S.D. = 1.1) and for the pneumonic calves sampled in November 2.8 months (S.D. = 0.9). Only four of the calves were sampled on both occasions (one calf in each of herd 3 and 5, and two calves in herd 6).",

These observations are in accordance with previous results, showing that BRSV plays an important role for the development of calf pneumonia in Denmark (Larsen et al., 1999; Uttenhal et al., 2000) . On the other hand, no BRSV-antigens could be detected in herds 5 and 6 and the test of paired sera from these two herds showed that seroconversion to BRSV had not taken place. Consequently, the etiology of pneumonic disease in these two herds was probably dependent on the presence of bacteria alone.

SAA concentrations of the healthy calves were much closer to those of the diseased populations than what was found for haptoglobin. Of the three herds in which healthy and diseased populations were compared to each other, BRSV could be demonstrated in the diseased subpopulations of herds 1 and 3 but not in the diseased population of herd 5. SAA concentrations in herd 5 did not differ between the diseased and the normal subpopulation. This might indicate that SAA needs virus to be present in order to respond while haptoglobin is fully induced by bacterial infection alone. It has previously been shown that SAA seems to be a more sensitive marker for viral infections (Heegaard et al., 2000) and acute inflammation (Alsemgeest et al., 1994; Horadagoda et al., 1999) compared to haptoglobin. In experimental bacterial infections (intra-tracheal inoculation of M. haemolytica), SAA was found to be more rapidly induced than haptoglobin (Horadagoda et al., 1994) . The results presented here show that even if SAA is more sensitive and rapidly reacting, haptoglobin might be preferable in the field, its bigger and more prolonged response giving rise to its higher sensitivity in detecting disease.",

For P. multocida, a higher number of samples were found positive by cultivation than by PCR, but the difference was not statistically significant. The lower sensitivity of the P. multocida PCR compared to cultivation may be due to the large size of the amplicon produced by this method (1250 bp) compared to the H. somni and M. haemolytica PCRs (both approximately 400 bp). Detection of P. multocida by both cultivation and PCR was significantly associated with the disease status of the animal, whereas no such association was observed for M. haemolytica. A previous study on H. somni demonstrated a higher sensitivity of a species-specific PCR test (Tegtmeier et al., 2000b) compared to bacterial cultivation. However, the present investigation indicates that PCR nevertheless is less suited for prediction of H. somni-related pneumonia compared to bacterial cultivation. These observations might be related to the fact that the use of a highly sensitive method such as PCR will also detect the presence of a very low number of bacteria that not necessarily have any correlation with disease. On the other hand, a higher diagnostic value of a PCR test could be obtained if real-time PCR tests were developed, whereby the infectious agents can be quantified and give a result which might better reflect the clinical status of the animal.",
