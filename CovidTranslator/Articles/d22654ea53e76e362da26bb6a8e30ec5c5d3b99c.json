The recent pandemic influenza strain H1N1 2009 emerged in Mexico in April 2009 and produced a late surge in northern hemisphere influenza cases. This virus then rapidly became the dominant influenza strain in the southern hemisphere. Although infections were generally mild, there was marked morbidity in pregnant and obese patients [1] . Determining host genetic factors that influence the innate immune response and susceptibility to novel infections may lead to therapeutic interventions for this and future emerging infections with higher overall morbidity.",

MBL binds to microbial cell surface polysaccharide residues that have characteristic chemical and spatial features that distinguish them from animal cell walls. Having bound to microbial pathogens, MBL mediates killing through lectin complement pathway activation and opsonophagocytosis. MBL has been observed to bind to and neutralize the influenza virus in studies involving nonpandemic H3N2 strains [3] . In this study, the efficacy of MBL-mediated inhibition of these influenza strains that have multiple exposed glycosylation sites on the hemagglutinin head was proportional to the number of glycosylation sites available for MBL binding. MBL null mice have increased susceptibility to H3N2 influenza A viruses [4] . Most recently, however, it has been demonstrated that in contrast to previous, seasonal influenza strains, MBL plays no role in murine models of influenza caused by H1N1 2009 infection [5] .",

Although MBL is predominantly a serum protein, significant amounts are observed in the respiratory tract in the presence of inflammation [8] . Given the in vitro neutralization of influenza by MBL, we believed that MBL deficiency may predispose to infection with influenza. We tested this hypothesis in a population naive to the novel pandemic strain H1N1 2009.",

Large studies of healthy controls confirm that many patients with wild-type MBL2 genotype have levels of MBL in the deficient range [6] . The choice of an MBL level of \u03fd0.5 g/mL to define MBL deficiency is informed by published data [6] . When we used a lower level of MBL to define deficiency, we also observed no indication that extremely low MBL levels predisposed to H1N1 2009 infection. Although there were fewer individuals with MBL \u03fd0.1 g/mL than with MBL levels \u03fd0.5, this only slightly reduced the power to detect our proposed OR of 3. Unfortunately, it was not possible to recruit the greater sample size required (168 participants) to achieve power using this MBL cutoff.

The absence of association between MBL deficiency and predisposition to H1N1 2009 infection we have observed is in line with and highlights the biologic significance of these in vitro data.
