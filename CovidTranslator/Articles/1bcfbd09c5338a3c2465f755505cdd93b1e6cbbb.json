At the same temperature and mass fraction of methanol (n-propanol, acetonitrile or 1,4-dioxane), the mole fraction solubility of ribavirin is greater in (methanol + water) than in the other three solvent mixtures. The preferential solvation parameters were derived from their thermodynamic solution properties by means of the inverse Kirkwood-Buff integrals. The preferential solvation parameters for methanol, n-propanol, acetonitrile or 1,4-dioxane (dx 1,3 ) were negative in the four solvent mixtures with a very wide compositions, which indicated that ribavirin was preferentially solvated by water. Temperature had little effect on the preferential solvation magnitudes. The higher solvation by water could be explained in terms of the higher acidic behaviour of water interacting with the Lewis basic groups of the ribavirin. Besides, the solubility of the drugs was mathematically represented by using the Jouyban-Acree model, van't Hoff-Jouyban-Acree model and Apelblat-Jouyban-Acree model obtaining average relative deviations lower than 1.57% for correlative studies. It is noteworthy that the solubility data presented in this work contribute to expansion of the physicochemical information about the solubility of drugs in binary solvent mixtures and also allows the thermodynamic analysis of the respective dissolution and specific solvation process.",

Therefore, the solubility of active ingredients is a significant physicochemical property to be considered in pharmaceutical design because it affects the drug efficacy, influencing several biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic properties [3, 4] . Moreover, temperaturedependence of the solubility allows evaluating the preferential solvation of the solute by the solvent components in mixtures, which gives a powerful tool in the understanding of molecular interactions in relation to the dissolution processes of drug [5] [6] [7] . Ribavirin (II) (CAS Registry No. 36791-04-5, chemical structure shown in Fig. S1 of Supporting material) is a well-known antiviral drug with a broad spectrum of action. Because of its activity against both RNA and DNA viruses [8] , it is recommended for the treatment of some infectious disorders including herpes [9] , respiratory syncytial viral disease, and acute respiratory infections caused by adenovirus [10] . At present, ribavirin is also part of a combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitis C [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and Lassa fever [14, 15] . Furthermore, it has been evaluated for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and as an anti-cancer drug with successful results for the treatment of leukemia and breast cancer [16] [17] [18] . Due to its good properties, ribavirin has been received great attention. Nevertheless, in spite of the usefulness of this drug, the physicochemical properties of ribavirin in aqueous and organic solutions have not been studied systematically in the previous works [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

It is well-known that solvent mixtures has been widely used in pharmacies long ago [1] [2] [3] [4] , only recently the mechanisms involving in the increase or decrease in drugs' solubility start to be approached from a deep thermodynamic point of view, including the analysis of the preferential solvation of solute by the components of mixtures [5] [6] [7] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . In terms of the considerations mentioned above, the main goal of this work is to report the equilibrium solubility of ribavirin in {methanol (1) + water (2)}, {n-propanol (1) + water (2)}, {acetonitrile (1) + water (2)}+ and {1,4-dioxane (1) + water (2)} mixtures at different temperatures in order to evaluate the respective thermodynamic quantities of the solution, as well as the preferential solvation of the drug by these organic solvents. This research expands the available solubility data about drug in neat organic solvents and solvent mixtures [1] and also allows the thermodynamic analysis of the respective dissolution and specific solvation process. It is noteworthy that methanol and 1,4-dioxane is not used to develop liquid medicines due to its high toxicity. But in some instances methanol is used in drug purification procedures [31] , as well as solvent in some drug microencapsulation techniques [32] . Moreover, methanol is widely used as mobile phase in high performance liquid chromatography [33] . In addition, 1,4-dioxane is widely used as a model co-solvent because it is miscible with water in all the range of compositions although it exhibits a low polarity as described by its dielectric constant [34] . Even more, the Jouyban-Acree model has been used to correlate the solubility of a lot of drugs in {methanol/1,4-dioxane (1) + water (2)} mixtures [35] . n-Propanol and acetonitrile are green solvents [36] and miscible with water in all compositions. In addition, although n-propanol is not widely used as co-solvent for design of liquid medicines, it has been used as solvent in the pharmaceutical industry for resins and cellulose esters [37, 38] . Acetonitrile is most widely utilized because of the high resolution attainable probably due to the low viscosity of water-acetonitrile mixtures [39] . Moreover, the wateracetonitrile mixtures may have a partially hydrophobic character similar to the methanol system since only the OH group in methanol is replaced by the CN group in acetonitrile.",

An excessive amount of ribavirin (II) was introduced into the jacketed glass vessel filled with about 60 ml solvent mixtures. Continuous stirring was achieved by using a magnetic stirrer at a given temperature to mix the solution intensively. The temperature of the solutions was kept at a desired value by circulating (water + isopropanol) mixture from the thermostatic bath through the outer jacket. So as to obtain the equilibration time of the studied systems, about 0.5 ml liquid phase was withdrawn every one hour by using a 2 mL of preheated syringe equipped with a pore syringe filter (PTFE 0.2 lm), and then analysed by the high-performance liquid phase chromatograph (Agilent-1260). Once the composition of liquid phase didn't vary, the system was believed to reach equilibrium. In order to make sure that sampling was performed at equilibrium conditions, two types of experiments were carried out, one starting from a supersaturated solution, in which the solid phase precipitated to reach equilibrium and the other starting from a non-saturated solution, in which solid dissolved to reach equilibrium. The results revealed that it took about 13 h to reach equilibrium for all the studied systems. Once the mixture arrived at equilibrium, stirring was turned off to allow any undissolved solute to be precipitated. One hour later, the upper liquid phase was withdrawn using the 2 ml of preheated or precooled syringe, and transferred rapidly to a preweighed volumetric flask equipped with a rubber stopper. The volumetric flask filled with sample was weighed again with the analytical balance. Subsequently, the sample was diluted with methanol, and 1 ll of the solution was withdrawn for analysis by using the high-performance liquid chromatography.The equilibrium mole fraction solubility of ribavirin (II) \u00f0x w;T \u00de in the four binary solvent mixtures are obtained with Eq. (1), and the initial composition of binary solvent mixtures (w) is calculated with Eqs. (2) and (3).",

In order to demonstrate the existence of polymorph transformation or solvate formation of ribavirin during the solubility determination, the equilibrium solid phase is collected and analysed by XRD. The patterns of the raw material and the solids crystallized in neat solvents and solvent mixtures are plotted in Fig. S3 of Supporting material. It is confirmed by XRD pattern that all the XRD patterns of solid phase of ribavirin in equilibrium with its solution have the same characteristic peaks with the raw material, which corresponds to form II reported in literatures [46] [47] [48] . Therefore, it can be concluded that there was no polymorph transformation or solvate formation during the entire experiment.",

In addition, the relationship between the mole fraction solubility and temperature and solvent composition are shown graphically in Figs. 1-4. It can be seen that, for the studied solvent mixtures, the ribavirin solubility is a function of temperature and solvent composition. The solubility of ribavirin increase with increasing temperature and mass fraction of water for the binary systems studied. The maximum solubility of ribavirin is observed in water. It can also be seen from Tables 1-4 that, at the same temperature and solvent composition, the solubility of ribavirin in (methanol + water) is greater than those in (n-propanol + water), (acetonitrile + water) and (1,4-dioxane + water). This behaviour may be due to the relative strong polarity of ribavirin molecule. At the same composition, the polarities of the four mixed solvents rank as (methanol + water) > (n-propanol + water) > (acetonitrile + water) > (1,4-dioxane + water) [49] . Therefore, the solubilities of ribavirin in (methanol + water) are larger than those in the other solvent mixtures.",

The difference may be due to many factors, such as determination method, equilibration time, purity, sampling, analysis method and so on. Based on study made by Vasa and Wildfong [23] , ribavirin (II) reached a maximum solubility within 30 min. On the other hand, it can also be seen from the plots of the ribavirin (II) concentrations in distilled water as a function of time that, when the dissolution time is 180 min, the concentration of ribavirin (II) in water remains increased obviously. Therefore, it can be speculated that if the time is prolonged, the ribavirin (II) concentration will also increase. In other words, the concentration (149 mg\u00c1ml \u00c01 ) at 30 min is not the equilibrium solubility of ribavirin (II) in water at studied temperature.",

The solubility of ribavirin in the four binary mixtures of (methanol + water), (n-propanol + water), (acetonitrile + water) and (1,4-dioxane + water) are evaluated on the basis of the regressed parameters' values. The calculated solubilities using the Jouyban\u00c0Acree model are plotted in Figs. 1-4. It can be seen from Table S2 that for the studied binary solvent mixtures, the maximum value of relative average deviations (RAD) is 1.57%, which is obtained with the van't Hoff-Jouyban-Acree model for the system of (n-propanol + water). Besides, the root-meansquare deviations (RMSD) are no greater than 2.14 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 . Comparison with the other models, the values of RAD and RMSD obtained with the Jouyban-Acree model is relatively small. On the whole, the three models can all be employed to correlate the solubility of ribavirin in the binary mixtures of (methanol + water), (npropanol + water), (acetonitrile + water) and (1,4-dioxane + water) at all initial composition ranges, and the Jouyban-Acree model provides better correlation results than the other two models.",

The obtained values of correlation volume V cor and dx 1,3 are listed in Tables S12-S15 of Supplementary material for {methanol (1) + water (2) Maximum negative values are obtained with the composition x 1 = 0.75 with dx 1,3 = \u00c02.314 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 to \u00c02.411 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 for the methanol (1) + water, x 1 = 0.75 with dx 1,3 = \u00c06.129 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 to \u00c06.488 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 for the n-propanol (1) + water (2), x 1 = 0.80 with dx 1,3 = \u00c061.20 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 to \u00c066.60 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 for the {acetonitrile (1) + water (2)}, and x 1 = 0.60 to 0.65 with dx 1,3 = \u00c078.98 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 to \u00c033.52 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 for {1,4-dioxane (1) + water (2)} mixtures. In the other regions for the {methanol (1) + water (2)}, {n-propanol (1) + water (2)} and {1,4-dioxane (1) + water (2)} mixtures, the dx 1,3 values of ribavirin (3) are positive. However they are all less than 1.0 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 . For the acetonitrile (1) + water (2) mixtures in water-rich composition, the dx 1,3 values are positive and slightly greater than 1.0 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 (e.g. 1.47 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 at 293.15 K). Nevertheless these values are much smaller than that in intermediate and acetonitrile-rich composition (e.g. -61.20 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 at 293.15 K). Therefore they are just qualitative because of uncertainties propagation effects instead of preferential solvation [59] [60] [61] . So the conclusion can be made that ribavirin is preferentially solvated by water for the four solvent mixtures with a very wide compositions. Probably the structuring of water molecules around the ribavirin molecule contributes to lowering of the net dx 1,3 to negative values in the four solvent mixtures. It can also be seen from Fig. 5 that the temperature has little effect on the preferential solvation magnitudes of ribavirin in the four solvent mixtures.",

It is conjecturable that ribavirin could be acting mainly as a Lewis base in front to water.",
