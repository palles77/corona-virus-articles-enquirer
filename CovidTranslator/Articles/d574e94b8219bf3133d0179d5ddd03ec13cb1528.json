Up to 20 % of videos were reported to have misleading information about various aspects of disease during these outbreaks 8, 10, 11 We are not aware of any studies evaluating the role of YouTube as a source of information on 2019 -nCoV. The objectives of our study were (i) to analyze the quality of the information available on YouTube about current nCoV outbreak (ii) to compare the English language content with the information available in Chinese Mandarin henceforth mentioned as Mandarin. It is the most widely spoken language in Asia and official language of China. The current n-CoV epidemic has affected the Asia Pacific region more than the West. We think that it is therefore important to review the available content in Mandarin",

The default YouTube algorithm of decreasing order of relevance was used for sorting the videos. These 150 videos were saved in a playlist for further analysis because the search results in YouTube can change on a day to day basis 7 . Uniform resource locators (URLs) of these videos were saved separately as back up. Our search methodology is in alignment with previous studies on YouTube content [15] [16] [17] Of the 150 videos screened, 72 videos in English and 42 videos in Mandarin were included in further analysis ( Figure 1A and 1B). Exclusion criterion were : videos in language other than English or Mandarin , absence of audio, videos lacking information on the 2019 novel coronavirus and duration more than 15 minutes. An analysis of 250 top YouTube channels concluded that the optimal length for a video is 10-16 minutes 18 . Videos with longer duration do not receive much viewership. Hence we excluded those videos from our study. The videos with subtitles were included in the group of the subtitle language. All videos were reviewed and analyzed by 2 independent reviewers (WZT and YYL ). Both WZT and YYL have received formal education in English and Chinese and are fluent in both. WZT is a haematologist and YYL is a medicine trainee. Any discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer NKB who is proficient in both English and spoken Mandarin. As this study required analysis of publicly available information, Institution Review Board approval was not required.",

We did not analyze other video sharing platforms such as health sharing websites or news channel websites. In addition, YouTube is not accessible from China. Instead, a platform called Youku is used for video sharing. This affects the applicability of results in China which is the epicentre of this disease outbreak. Restriction of YouTube in China also explains the relative lesser number of views of Mandarin language videos compared to those in English. Nonetheless, Mandarin remains the widest spoken language in Asia Pacific region and videos in this language serve as an important source of information to native Mandarin speakers in this region.

This strategy was based on our preliminary review of number of videos with each search term. The Mandarin term for 2019 novel coronavirus ' 2019 \u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2' showed only 380000 videos compared to 58100000 videos identified with the term '\u6b66\u6c49\u75c5\u6bd2' which means Wuhan virus in Mandarin. This indicated that the former term was not very popular in Mandarin language and hence was omitted from further inclusion. YouTube's search can be affected by the previous search history.

For example a video would be scored 5 for the treatment/outcome component if it mentions all of the following : the symptoms can be self-resolving but some cases can become dangerously ill requiring hospitalization or intensive care unit, disease can lead to death, treatment is mainly supportive, vaccinations not yet available.

The mean number of days since upload on YouTube for useful videos was 6 in our study compared to 61 days asreported by Pathak et al during the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak. It has been reported that the viewership of videos tends to decrease over time and that could lead to higher number of views/day in the initial days of video upload . Regardless, the difference is substantial and high viewership of content in our study should be considered as a reflection of growing popularity of YouTube for health related information. The higher number of views can also be explained by the global spread of this disease compared to previous outbreaks like Ebola which was mainly restricted to Africa. The current content on YouTube in English is mostly informative . There were only 2 misleading videos amongst the included 72 videos. These results are reassuring.

YouTube is gaining popularity for its content in non-English languages too. In the first week of 2019, a total of 243,254 videos were posted on YouTube, out of these 67 % were in languages other than English 27 . This prompted us to evaluate the information available on YouTube about nCoV in Mandarin and compare it to the content in English. The mean DISCERN scores were similar in 2 groups indicating comparable reliability. Similarly, comparable but very low mean total MICI scores were noted in both groups, suggesting overall paucity of good quality scientific information on n-CoV outbreak. The information pertaining to screening and testing was worst with mean MICI scores of 0.95 and 0.31 in English and Mandarin groups respectively. Under representation of government agencies was noted in Mandarin videos as well. News updates constituted most of the Mandarin videos too, however compared to English new agencies, the narrators of news clips in Mandarin often commented on how Chinese government could have acted differently to contain this epidemic early. No videos were shared by academic institutions and hospitals in Mandarin which contributed to slightly higher percentage of misleading videos in Mandarin.Contrary to the English videos, the misleading videos in Mandarin were more popular than useful videos, as evidenced by higher mean number of likes. The misleading information in native language at epicentre of outbreak might have led to undue public distress during early phase of outbreak. YouTube thus should play a more active role in screening the content of such videos and censoring misleading information.",
