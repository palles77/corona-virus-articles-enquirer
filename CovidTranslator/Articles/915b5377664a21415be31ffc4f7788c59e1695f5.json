An important aim in combating the disease is achieving an effective vaccine which can act against both the primary and recurrent disease caused by herpes simplex virus. The company strategy has therefore been to adapt live viruses by genetic manipulation to introduce an acceptable margin of safety through the development of DISC (Disabled Infectious Single Cycle) virus vaccines. These are viruses which lack an essential gene, and are therefore unable to undergo multi-cycle replication in a vaccinated host. They can, however be prepared in a way that allows them to go through a single cycle of replication in cells of the vaccinee, leading to an effective immune response. It has been shown that herpes simplex viruses lacking the essential glycoprotein H (gH) gene can be used as effective vaccines (Farrell et al., 1994; McLean et al., 1994) . The virus is therefore genetically inactivated so that it is unable to spread within the host. * Part of this work was presented as a poster at the ESACT meeting in Tours, France. September 1997.",

The Vero cells were modified to contain the HSV-2 gH gene under the control of the HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) gene promoter (Boursnell et al., 1997) . The complementing cell line was designated CR2. Because the gD promoter requires additional HSV proteins for its induction, gH is regulated so that it is only produced in the cell following an infection with virus. Virus produced from CR2 cells can infect normal cells, but can only perform one cycle of replication. The progeny virus from this replication cycle lack the gH protein and are therefore non-infectious ( Figure 1 ).",

Currently the DISC-HSV is propagated in the CR2 cell line. The CR2 cell line is an adherent cell and therefore routine culture was performed in roller bottle cultures. Whilst this method of cell growth and virus production is suitable for development work it is not a desirable system for the manufacture of the virus on a larger scale. The use of microcarriers as a support for anchorage-dependent cells has been reported previously (Hu et al., 1985; Van Wezel, 1973) . Anchorage-dependant cell lines have been cultured to produce a variety of viruses on a large scale (Talbot et al., 1989; Lesko et al., 1993; Baijot et al., 1987; Meignier, 1978) . Some cell lines such as Vero and MRC5 have been propagated on microcarriers to produce human viral vaccines (Fabry et al., 1989; Griffiths et al., 1980; Montagnon et al., 1981) . Griffiths et al. (1982) have demonstrated HSV-2 production from cells cultured on low (2 g l \u22121 ) concentrations of Cytodex microcarriers. The yields obtained were ten-fold lower when compared to those achieved from a roller bottle system. It was hoped that our current microcarrier system would produce equivalent productivity when compared to the standard roller bottle process.",

Cytodex 3 microcarriers gave a similar cell number as expected but this microcarrier has a pig skin collagen layer on the bead. Cytodex 1 was selected in preference to the other microcarriers because of good cell growth and to remove the issue of animal products in the manufacturing process. We currently use the Cytodex 1 at a level of 5 g l \u22121 . The growth medium used was Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% Foetal Approximately 75% of the final volume of cultivation medium and 5 g l \u22121 of microcarriers were pre-incubated in the culture vessel overnight. The culture parameter set points were controlled by using the Applikon 1030 controlling system for both vessels. The culture pH was maintained by controlling at a set point of 7.2\u00b10.2 by sparging air/CO 2 (90:10%) into the spin filter. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were kept above a minimum set point of 30% saturation by sparging when necessary into a spin filter with air for the 1 l cultures and with pure oxygen in the 15 l cultures. The culture temperature was maintained at 37 \u2022 C throughout the cell growth period by use of a recirculating thermocirculator attached to the jacket of the 2 l vessels and in the case of the 20 l vessels the Applikon controlling system used a similar integral recirculating thermocirculator.",

Cell growth was monitored by estimating nuclei released from a sample of microcarrier culture taken from the reactor after incubation in 0.1 M citric acid containing 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet (Sanford et al., 1951) . Glucose and lactate concentrations were determined using an off-line YSI 2700 glucose/lactate analyser (YSI, U.K. Ltd). Glucose and lactate concentrations were controlled by partial media changes on days 2 and 3 for the 1 l culture and days 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the 15 l culture. The 15 l culture was maintained for an additional 48 h period compared to the small scale 1 l cultures in Figure 5 . The bionebuliser is a low pressure shear disruption method which uses nitrogen as a carrier gas. The disrupter is depicted here schematically indicating how the process disrupts cells. Using a carrier gas pressure of 50 psi cells are drawn up and nebulised. This cell mixture is directed to a ceramic ball bearing where they impact. The cells are disrupted to release the virus and the whole disrupted cell/virus solution is collected. order to provide a maximal cell density at the point of infection.",

It is expected that the microcarriers will be sterilised in-situ inside the production vessels. Preliminary work at 35 l scale employs the use of an internal sieve to aid the washing and conditioning process. At present at the 35 l scale this step takes approximately 2 h to complete. This washing and conditioning step may be an extensive time constraint at a manufacturing scale. Tackling the engineering problem in terms of pipe work and increasing flow rates could reduce this time. This is an issue that is under review and will require suitable development time to reduce it satisfactorily.

This maintenance of the cell productivity has not always been observed when virus production systems have been scaled up. Griffiths et al. (1982) had a tenfold decrease in cell productivity of HSV per cell when switching from roller bottle cultures to a microcarrier system using Vero cells. This may have been an artefact of poor virus release from the cells. In comparison, when culturing the HSV-2 on MRC-5 cells, a significant but smaller decrease in production levels was observed when changing from roller bottle cultures to microcarrier cultures. This observation reinforces the issues made in some early virus production work reported by Giard et al., 1977. They proposed that there are specific virus/cell line requirements coupled with a specific optimisation of the conditions not only for the growth of the cells but also for the virus production phase. The production of hepatitis A in microcarrier culture was reported to be 8-fold lower than when cultured in conventional flask cultures (Widell et al., 1984) . The maintenance of productivity seen in this study is very encouraging in moving the culture system forward to a larger scale which may be suitable for the production of Phase III material and for the supply of commercial requirements. Due to the productivity's shown here, production at a 15 l scale would be large enough to supply material for Phase I and Phase II studies.",
