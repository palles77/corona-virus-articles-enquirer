Recently, hydrogel and nanogel based drug delivery devices poses new prospects to simulate the natural intelligence of various biological systems. Owing to their unique porous interpenetrating network design, hydrophobic drug incorporation and stimulus sensitivity hydrogels owe excellent potential as targeted drug delivery system. Present review is an attempt to highlight the recent trends of hydrogel based drug delivery systems for the delivery of therapeutic agents and diagnostics for the major infectious diseases including Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Malaria, Tuberculosis, Influenza and Ebola.

The infectious diseases come in the category of communicable diseases as they can be transferred from one person to the other that include dengue, malaria and tuberculosis whereas when the transfer occurs from one species to other, flu or influenza occurs. 5 These disease can be broadly classified firstly as diseases, which firmly persist like malaria, tuberculosis secondly earlier unknown diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome and lastly to the diseases, which threaten to enhance in the near future (e.g., avian influenza). The developing countries are the major sufferers and half of the deaths are happening due to these infectious diseases. 6 For a better understanding, we need to gather our knowledge about the bacterial pathogens, which are classified as extracellular and intracellular pathogens on the basis of the in vivo life and pathogenicity. The main target in the localized diseases such as inflammation and infection are the overexpressed epitopes or receptors. The initialization of the use of antibiotics with the penicillin in late 1940s was a great success and further advancements for the stronger antibiotics begun. 7 Though the resistance to the antimicrobial drugs was a threat to the hospitals and community and the number of effective drugs to control infection by the old bacteria decreased. 8, 9 Thus the invention of the nano carrier systems offered antibiotics to be delivered selectively to phagocytic cells and to increase their cellular penetration and the treatment of the intracellular infections. 10 The factors behind these infections include number of aspects owing to the change in the environment, which increases the frequency of the contact with the host carrying an infection and thus increase the chance of encountering the microorganisms formerly unfamiliar to beings. Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most feared diseases until the discovery of antibiotics in 1940s that caused large scale human deaths. 11, 12 Over the last 20 years researchers are in the urge of discovering nanotechnology based drug carriers such as smart materials \"nano/ micro gels\" inside which the cargos can be encapsulated and gives a sustained release of drugs rather than the conventional free drug delivery. 13 In the present article one of the section deals with the brief overview of the disease and the various benefits of hydrogel based drug delivery systems (DDS) for TB. encapsulating various cargos inside these NFs have been the main attention owing to their numerous benefits like low toxicity, effective therapeutic dosages. Among all these nanoforms hydrogels especially nanogels have gained lot of attention and have emerged as an innovative and promising therapeutic interventions. [32] [33] [34] [35] Moreover the clinical applications of these NFs are being upgraded yet the implementations of few strategies require more advanced therapies. 36, 37 The present article focusses on hydrogel based drug delivery systems and clinical applications of these systems to treat major infectious diseases. The other infectious diseases, which have caused destruction to human health care worldwide include the AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, Influenza A, Ebola that have been discussed in the present review.",

Most importantly the helper T lymphocytes activate and coordinate with the other activated cells of the immune system. The surface receptor CD4 helps the HIV to attach to T lymphocytes represented as CD4+. The occurrence of the errors i.e., the mutations by the enzyme the reverse transcriptase during the process of making a copy of RNA to DNA increases, which thereby increases the HIV and eventually enhances the replication process. In a very short interval of time, i.e., within few days the infected persons genital fluids as well as blood get infected simultaneously reducing the numbers of CD4+. The most initial step in the infection cycle of HIV is the union of viral cover with a target cell and followed by the release of its genome into cell. Studies also reveal that HIV enters into cell via endocytosis at the cell membrane. 43 ",

            "text": "Till 1987 the invention of antiretroviral drugs and the treatment consisted of treating complications from opportunistic infections and malignancies. The first effective therapy against HIV was the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine (AZT). The invention of combinations of NRTIs was also not that successful to supress the virus for long periods. Thus highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced instead of early anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Though it is a well-known fact that the NRTI are the major component of drug cocktails and are known to develop a varying degree of myopathy, lipodistrophy, or peripheral or central nervous system (CNS) neuropathy. These side effects are associated with mitochondrial toxicity of NRTIs. All these side effects are usually associated with mitochondrial toxicity of NRTIs that inhibit DNA polymerase \u03b3 and cause mtDNA dysfunction. 47 The reduction in the dosage and targeted drug delivery to the infected cells are the most demanding way to reduce the adverse toxic effects. The advancement in nanotechnology have come up with the development of NFs for encapsulation of the antiviral drugs that are more efficient and known for long term therapy. Moreover the DNA vaccines known for generating long-term humoral and cellular immune responses for protective immunity are accompanied by many major drawbacks such as low immunogenicity in clinical tests and early degradation caused by DNAases and lysosomes. 48 The injected naked DNA plasmids exhibit poor distribution and are inefficiently expressed. Thus nanocarriers as drug delivery systems are efficient carrier of DNA into mammalian cells and increases their stability and protects it from degradation.",

            "text": "Interestingly, the Central nervous system (CNS) is the most loved target for HIV, which gets infected at very initial stages of infection. 49 The hallmarks for HIV in CNS are the asymptomatic neurocongnitive impairment, mild neurocongnitive disorder (MND), HIVassociated dementia (HAD), 50 other disease on later stages of the infections include cryptococcal meningitis and primary CNS lymphonoma. In past few years, researchers have confronted various neurotoxic effects of present antiviral therapy contributing to the low efficiency for the eradication of HIV. Various conventional strategies for the safe delivery of different drugs to CNS include liposomes 51-53 nanoparticles, 54-56 colloidal drug carriers, 57 intranasal 58, 59 and olfactory route of administrations 60 etc. Antiviral treatments are often accompanied by accumulation of antiviral drugs in CNS due to poor permeability, occurrence of associated encephalitis and neurodegenerations in the CNS. As soon as the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) enters the neurons and cause inhibition of mDNA i.e., mitochondrial DNA directly affects ATP production and results in insufficient energy for cellular homeostatis maintenance. The entire permeability of the mitochondrial membrane depends entirely upon the charge and hydrophobicity. From these facts, it is inferred that hydrophilic and negatively charged compounds are less permeable. Thus cationic nanogels, which neutralizes the NTP (Active 5\u00b4-triphosphatases) and increase the cellular penetration are emerging candidates. Mitochondrial toxicity of NRTI has been greatly reduced by the combination of nanogel/NTP nanodrugs. Nanogel, based drug delivery systems are in demand and are now being explored for HIV. 43 Emphasis is given on the exploration of physiological accumulation of the nanogel in the brain, which plays an important role in pathogenesis of neuronal diseases. Nanogels are being modified using hydrophobic moieties or many such compounds, which have the capability to enhance the permeability of BBB by crossing the tight junctions between the endothelial cells. 61 Though various limitations are associated and need to be taken care of such as the decrease in physical restrictiveness of endothelial tight junctions and overcrowding of molecules inside the brain and can cause the flooding and restrict the supply of essential nutrients. Owing to the biodegradability and biocompatibility the bio-polymeric nanogels 62 they are the most demanding delivery systems for the therapeutics interventions for CNS. 63 Nanotechnology based delivery systems including nanogels have found useful to overcome the challenge of the BBB integrity as by using these nanoforms. There is a great enhancement of permeability of the pharmaceutical excipients and thus can target the active site. Surface charge and hydrophobicity of the nanogels have a great influence on the adsorption of the plasma proteins and thus affect the uptake by transcytosis. 64 Polysorbate 80 , a non-ionic surfactant have been exploited by NFs for brain delivery. 65 The endogenous protein widely used by antiretroviral drug delivery systems is transferrin and have proven to be very useful in targeting the BBB. The targeting mechanism may be passive or active. Other than these most importantly cell penetrating peptides i.e., HIV-1 Tat peptides are widely used for enhancing the brain delivery of anti-HIV drugs. Recently, a novel approach demonstrated by showed magnetically guided non-invasive delivery of a drug-nanocarrier to the central nervous system. This method is safe and exhibited improve navigation to the BBB. 66 NFs including nanogels target monocytes/ macrophages due to their significant role in HIV infection of the CNS. These possess various receptors like mannose residues and help them in the recognition and endocytosis of the nanocargos. The hydrogel nanoparticles are also termed as \"nanogels\" 67 are actively been used as DDS for both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs with polymeric matrices and particles having high water absorption capacity. Efforts are being made to functionalize and modify the hydrogel based NFs for the brain delivery to eradicate neuro-AIDS.",

NRTIs are known to be the first-line drugs in AIDS treatment and components of the multi-drug cocktails of the HAART. The study presented a platform for low neurotoxicity and high anti-HIV activity eliminating many side effects for systemic administrations. This study demonstrated the advantages of a nanogel based delivery systems owing to small d\u223c 20nm nanocarriers prepared by the selfassembling spherical cationic CEPL polymer network. 43 Other functional modification by which nanogels are being modified for brain delivery is PEGylation of the cationic nanocarriers. 74 These smart carriers showed great potential to pass through the BBB. PEGylated cationic nanocarriers, loaded with negatively charged drugs, demonstrated longer blood circulation and better chances to penetrate the BBB. 75 It is well reported that the use of NRTIs in antiviral therapy is neurotoxic and it is very difficult to eradicate neuro AIDS by using it. A very innovative and novel study by Greson et al. 73 demonstrated the use of nanogels based formulation as safer alternative to the current antiviral therapy. A low neurotoxicity and excellent antiviral activity of nano-NRTIs was reported ( Figure. 3). The nanogels was synthesized using PEG and PEI using crosslinkers. 76 The synthesized nanogels were then modified with MAL-PEG-NHS (M.w. 5,000, 33% wt) linker molecules. Nanogel NG2 was synthesized using carbodiimide-activated carboxylated PAMAM dendrimer (Generation 5) with an excess of branched PEI (M.w. 1,200) to obtain a PAMAM-PEI core conjugate.

The infection is transmitted by the bite of female Anopheles mosquito. 78 The main reason for malaria proliferation is the increased number of drug resistant parasites. The WHO report (2014) estimates 3.3 billion people are at risk of malaria, among 1.2 billion are at high risk. In high-risk areas, more than one malaria case occurs per 1000 population. 79 Briefly, the pathogenesis of malaria can be best understood by the understanding the mechanisms including parasite invasion, parasite biology, and host defence. 80 The disease in humans occurs by the transmission of Plasmodium sporozoites by a bite from an infected anopheline. The pathway sporozoites take is via salivary glands of the mosquito through bloodstream of the host to the liver and attack the hepatocytes. There occurs a 1000-fold division till the formation of mature schizonts having thousands of daughter merozoites. 81 One of the causes of the morbidity and mortality of malaria is anemia and occurs after the massive erythrocytes lysis due to elevate parasitemia or immune haemolysis.",

In recent years, hydrogels based systems for antimalarial drugs are also being explored which have shown decent results. Curcumin has been described to be effective, either alone or in combination with artemisinin and its derivatives, in mice infected with various Plasmodium strains such as P. falciparum, P. berghei, P. chabaudi, etc. probably due to its immunomodulatory action, its inhibition of histone acetylation and generation of reactive oxygen species, or its action on PfATP6 protein which has reported implications in malarial infections. 91 92, 93 Nanoparticles of curcumin, both polymeric 94 and lipidic 95 are among the many novel approaches being explored by researchers to surmount these problems. The small size of these systems provides longer circulation time to the encapsulated drugs due to enhanced organ penetration and retention. Biodegradable nanoparticles have been developed for intracellular drug delivery. Moreover the emphasis is given on the stimuli responsive delivery systems due to their inherent characteristics like specificity to endogenous stimuli like lowering of the intestinal pH increased concentration of glutathione concentration or an increased level of enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases. These factors are influential at the cellular level such as the sensitivity towards varying pH directly influences the release of the cargo into the late endosomes or lysosomes to the cell cytoplasm. Moreover if at the tissue level it is seen we can further explore the specific microenviornmental changes occurring in the neoplastic diseases as well as inflammatory diseases or pathological states like ischemia. or infections. 96 The parasitic infection \"malaria\" has been the major global health concern in tropical countries like India. Artemisinin and their derivative are the known effective treatments for antimalarial therapy. Though the therapy is restricted due to its high cost and availability and artemisinin combination therapies are in demand (ACT), 91, 97 which further have certain limitations like pharmacokinetic incompatibilities between artemisinin and the combination drugs. Novel strategies are being explored for the improvement of the functional performance of the curcumin to encapsulate it in variety of delivery systems like nanoparticles, hydrogel beads, liposomes, emulsions and biopolymer complexes. Dandekar et al 98 demonstrated the use of nanogels of curcumin in particle form using a combination of hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). The study showed that the in vivo antimalarial action when compared with the curcumin control the hydrogel nanoparticles can be used as an effective adjuvant therapy and prevent the recurrence and/or reduce the dose of the regular anti-malarial drugs. The study demonstrated the extent of DNA damage in the individual cell by using an assay also known as single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE), a sensitive indicator of DNA damage. This technique showed fluorescent staining visualized as a \"Comet\" like structure with a circular head and a tail extending toward the anode due to the overall negative charge of damaged DNA. The length and intensity of the tail are indicative of the amount of DNA damage. The fluorescent intensities of the head and the tail are measured by the Comet software for computing the TL, TM, TMO, and percent DNA damage in animals treated with cyclophosphamide indicating its clastogenic potential. The results showed no Comet formation was observed in the treatment groups in animals of either sex, as well as for the control group. 98 Thus the genetoxicity assays are helpful in confirmation of the nongenotoxicity and cellular safety of the developed HPMC nanoparticles of curcumin.",

Simple Microscopy is the gold standard for malaria diagnosis but in local health centers with restricted resources, malaria is diagnosed presumptively in patients with fever. 100 Other new technologies include Immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that provide an alternative to microscopy at the point of care though carries certain limitation like decreased sensitivity at lower levels of Parasitaemia inhibition at high levels of parasitaemia (prozone effect), inability to quantitate or distinguish malaria species in mixed infections, and failure to detect parasites with mutations in the genes encoding certain target antigens.

This gel based chips were capable of detecting all the plasmodium species with a limit of detection for the plasmodium falciparum of 2 parasites/\u00b5L of blood.

Page 10 predicted that the non-replicating state is believed to reduce M. tuberculosis phenotypically resistant to other bactericidal antibiotics. 110, 111 The introduction of drug resistance phenomena was followed up by the introduction of streptomycin for curing TB by Selman Waksman. Now the call for the worry is the emergence of the extensively drug resistant strain (XDR). The M. tuberculosis strains that are resistant to at least one of the second-line, injectable drug like capreomycin, kanamycin and to any fluoroquinolone drugs like ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin or ofloxacin). Owing to their high cost, toxicity and low efficacy high dosage is suggested as well as for a longer time interval i.e., 24 months. Moreover the use of second line anti tubular drugs also provide improved spectrum of antibiotics. Still we can say that there is a strong demand to develop such DDS using the current anti-tuberculosis drugs for their effective delivery. Nanomedicine is on impulse of developing delivery vehicles for more effective and improved treatments for TB. Here we provide the current overview of the development in nanomedicine for TB highlighting the use of hydrogels based DDS. 112, 113 Regardless of prompt advancement over the last decade, hydrogel technologies have not yet been interconnected in the area of active clinical TB research. Intensive development of nanogels to provide effective delivery pathways with sustained and on demand drug delivery stand-in end-points for novel strategies in nanomedicine. An important investigation demonstrated that the inhalation delivery of poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microspheres (MS) when loaded with the anti-tuberculosis agent rifampicin (RFP-PLGA MS) to alveolar macrophage (M\u03d5) cells could be an valuable drug delivery system for the management of tuberculosis Fig. 6 . 114 Recent trends suggest that Intravenous (IV) administration of microparticles (MPs) which have dimensions larger than the diameter of a capillary poses a great potential for passive drug targeting to the pulmonary circulation. 115 It is known that the capillary beds of organs such as the lung, act as mechanical filters that competently entrap MPs following IV administration. 116 The necessity to traverse the mucus/ surfactant and cell/ mucosal layers encountered from the ventilation gives the opportunity for the passive lung targeting by IV administration. In addition to the cell/mucosal barrier, it is well known that mucus represents a significant diffusional barrier to micron-sized particles.",

The fluorescent signal was seen in the course of the study in 48 hour in kidney and was not observed in lungs at that point of time. Non toxicity was also evaluated by histopathological studies using H & E staining and broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) (Fig. 7) . These investigations suggested that the nanogels can serve as the potential alternatives for the treatment of various pulmonary diseases such as asthma, pneumonia, tuberculosis and disseminated lung cancer. 123 One of the other major known forms of the tuberculosis is the infection to the colon, which give rise to intestinal tuberculosis. Intestinal tuberculosis is a colon infection caused by MTB that is usually treated just like the pulmonary form of the disease. 124 The restriction posed by the recent therapeutics is the long path of antibiotics to eradicate the infection, which requires, isoniazid (INH, 300 mg) and rifampin (RMP, 600mg) taken daily for 18 to 24 months which have a likelihood that the bacteria will develop to the treatment. Though various side effects are associated with both the drugs like effects of INH (rash, abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis, side roblastic anemia, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy) and RMP (hepatitis, liver failure, breathlessness, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and flu-like symptoms) these side effects pushes the patient to discontinue the treatment and thus develop acquired drug-resistant TB during the course of therapy 125, 126 This drug-resistant TB is more severe public health issue in many developing countries due to the high cost of treatment and more medication requirements for a longer time interval. Nano medicine emerged with nanocarriers having characteristics to increase the patient compliance with very less side effects. These nano carriers have increased effects and the drugs can be entrapped into it for the sustained delivery. 127, 128 One of the recent study by Chen et al 129 a poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) nanogel was developed as a carrier of INH and RMP by a two-step approach as illustrated in Fig. 8 . The nanogels showed a uniform spherical morphology (572 \u00b1 23 nm). The LC of INH and RMP was 74.1 \u00b5g/mg and 39.3 \u00b5g/mg, respectively. The LE of INH and RMP was 62.5% and 33.7%, respectively. These gels demonstrated that the PMAA have a sustained release behavior in a medium simulating the gastrointestinal tract, and a case III mechanism. These nanogels demonstrated a potential as a more useful formulation than INH and RMP and is a step forward in the field of treatment against multidrug-resistant intestinal MTB.",

Many research groups had constantly worked on the new laboratory methods for influenza detection, which included the virus detection by conventional virus culture monitored by the serological differentiation 133, 134 and also by the use of RT-PCR 135, 136 . Though these methods own limitations such as their high cost and efficient biosafety facilities. Efforts are made to replace the long-time taking methods like ELISA which is time consuming as well as rapid influenza antigen test 137, 138 by the QCM biosensor based technology detection. [139] [140] [141] The use of aptamers in diagnostics have also been highlighted in comparison to antibodies due to their ability to get chemically modified and easy labelling and stability. Basically aptamers are generally known to be artificial nucleic acid ligands used for specifically targeting against certain targets, such as amino acids, drugs and other bioactives. 142 Herein, we discuss the use of hydrogels for sensitive detection of the AIV H5N1. Moreover the use of DNA and aptamer based hydrogel systems for the biosensing applications have been highlighted. 143 The characteristic properties of DNA of folding into unique secondary and tertiary structures and its inherent biocompatibility and easy synthesis make it a perfect candidate to engineer hydrogel based systems for application in nanomedicine and biosensing. 144, 145 Hydrogel have the superiority to preserve the biological activity of the sensing material as well as diversity of substrates embedded within the hydrogel matrix. Owing to the high loading capability, relatively small amount of hydrogel could be employed and the patterning inside the surface modified microfluidic channels would provide a stable system. A high impact study carried out by Wang et al 2013 146 demonstrated the use of hydrogel based QCM aptasensor for AIV detection. This group developed an aptamer-ssDNA crosslinked polymeric hydrogel as a sensor coating material. The use of the hydrogel coating material made by the use of (acrylamide-coaptamer) H5N1 with the titres of 6, 64, 6.4, 1.28 and 0.128 HAU was detected by the use of QCM biosensor. Figure 9 shows a decrease in resonance frequency shift for the detection of the target H5N1 with titres of 64, 6.4 and HAU and the corresponding resonance frequency was \u2212200, \u221252, \u221222 Hz respectively. 146 The result showed that noticeable signal was obtained for H5N1 with a titre 0.128 HAU as shown by the typical detection curve. It is also observed that the hydrogels possess swelling on the sensor surface.",

The toughest part to achieve a complete protection level against the increasing spread of the deadly virus is in the current vaccine strategies, which require more time to generate billion monovalent doses that have optimum immunization dose for 500 million individuals with that of the two doses of the killed vaccines required for the defence. The two main recognised vaccines for this deadly virus are known as killed virus vaccine given as intramuscular injection and the other is a reduced live vaccine particular as a nasal spray. Though the emerging strains of virus which expresses variant antigenic epitopes urges the need for new vaccine development. Moreover the antigenic drift and shift causes the loss of effectiveness of the current influenza virus vaccines that show antiviral CD8+ T cell responses may evade the major drawback of the commercially available vaccines. Thus vaccines that have the capacity to generate the CD8+ T cell response s against the viral molecules and conserved among the various serotypes of influenza virus and can serve as \"universal vaccines\". 147 The major concern is that yet there is no such CD8+ T cell inducing vaccine against influenza virus. As these cells require replication and the protein immunization is ineffective an interesting study by the Boesteanu et al 148 developed a biopolymer encapsulated live influenza virus to vaccinate C57Bl/6J mice using a subcutaneous route of administration. The infection was induced by the exposure of the respiratory tract to virus. It is well known that from last many years' large doses of influenza virus intraperitoneally (IP) to prime animals for secondary responses [149] [150] [151] with reports of no infection. IP injection of 3\u00d7106 TCID50 PR8 influenza strain induces no inflammatory cytokines in tissues and no viral replication or weight loss in animals. 152 It was established that the subcutaneous route of administration of live virus did not source overt disease and mice neither lose weight, nor appeared sick. It was demonstrated that the subcutaneous vaccination of mice with live influenza virus was found to be safe immunodeficient Rag\u2212/\u2212\u03b3c\u2212/\u2212 mice that received live influenza virus were healthy and had no viral replication in tissues.",

This system was an injectable form of hydrogels that have the tendency to gelate at body temperature enabling prolonged residence time of the H5N1 split antigen in nasal cavity. 153, 154 It was also demonstrated that the system enhanced the transepithelial transport via the paracellular routes due to the disorganization of ZO-1 protein in nasal epithelial tissue. Superior antigen-specific systemic immune responses and mucosal IgA immunity without adjuvants was achieved in comparison to the naked H5N1 split antigen and MF59 adjuvant antigen. Figure 11 demonstrate the potential of the of HTCC hydrogels using non-invasive fluorescence imaging. It was well observed that no signal source from the fluorescence labeled antigen was detected after 1 h when mice were treated with PBS/antigen. Detection of strong fluorescence intensity after 1 h once hydrogel/antigen was directed, and the residence time was for at least 2 h in the nasal cavity. It also shows the quantitative measurement of nasal fluorescence intensity and more than 54% antigen was in the nasal tissue after the co-delivery with hydrogel over 2 h. In comparison, a sharp decrease was observed in PBS/ antigen group, and only 12% of antigen retained in nasal cavity. Thus this system also supported the fact that hydrogels possess an enhanced delivery effect and suggested that the HTCC hydrogels are a perfect candidate to act as an adjuvant -free vaccine delivery systems for intranasal H5N1 split antigen vaccination.",

There is partial success in the development of the therapeutics and prompt diagnostics. 156 The upsurge for the post exposure therapeutics is in demand due to the localized and sporadic nature of ebola infection. The extent of survival of the non-human primates is typically 6-9 days once infected. This poses a great challenge on the treatment for reduction in virus replication till the immune response expands for effective control of the infection ( Figure 12 ). Presently, the post therapeutics are to be given in an hour to completely protect the experimentally infected animals. 157, 158 The strong immunity against the adenovirus significantly hinders its development as antigen vectors. Nanomedicine is emerging as cutting edge in clinical medicine and provides a synergistic approach for design and diagnostics of NFs. The invent of mucosal vaccination over conventional intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous immunization suggest an effective system and mucosal immune response. 159 Recently a research group showed that mucosal delivery of adenovirus-based vaccines could efficiently evade the preexisting immunity. Ad-GPZ antigen co-delivered with QD-60 and QD-79.5 hydrogels encouraged high systemic response as well as the respiratory mucosal immune responses thus exhibiting a magnified humoral immunity. 160 Recent advancements show the use of Nanotechnology based electrochemical immunosensors based miniaturized devices which have the ability to target the analytes (pM level). Researchers suggest the use of miniaturized electrochemical ebola sensing systems for early detection of EBOV level. 161 The emphasis on the developments of hydrogel based sensors based on the dissociation and displacement of protein binding partners.

The interactions of the cell and genes and the hydrogels and the underlying mechanism at the nanoscale level has to be understood for a successful translation from lab to market applications in nanomedicine. As we are towards the beginning of the new millennium new NFs and diagnostic technologies would allow rapid disease cure and diagnosis and make things easier for clinicians to detect the organism causing the specific disease and existence of antimicrobial resistance genes. A long term commitment is required to fight against these infectious diseases. Prospective to exploit the nanotechnology based systems specifically hydrogels is due to their ability to transform the specificity and efficacy of the present existing drugs as well as improve their clinical applications. There is still a need to pursue the effective health infrastructures for the complete eradication of the epidemics and pandemics world-wide. These systems will act as catalyst for individual infectious diseases like malaria, slow down the spread of the deadly Ebola crisis and also the destruction triggered by the HIV/AIDS. Presently, there is an urgent need to outbreak the competences of nanotechnology and boost up the pathogen detection for deadly Ebola virus. 161 The quick detection of Ebola virus is the most important factor in lowering down the circulation rate of the virus inside the patient's body. The detectable virus level is attained in at least 3 days after the symptoms appear. Thus funding agencies like the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports on the research and development for novel diagnostics for Ebola and Lassa fever, an acute viral hemorrhagic fever first known 1969 in Nigeria. The research group at Boston University College of Engineering and School of Medicine in collaboration with the company NextGen Assays, generated a device that detects the disease by means of a single drop of blood from the patient, by shining light on viral nanoparticles attached to a silicon chip. 163, 164 Classically several drugs which are used to cure infectious diseases face an important limitation known as drug resistance. The medical community including the pharmacists and chemist are in the urge of finding a simple regimen of medications for all the severe infectious diseases. Treatment of tuberculosis is one of the major example, which come up with the emergence of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) known as a strain of TB susceptible to few first line medications and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) that is regarded as untreatable. The goal of eradicating the drug resistance for TB has been initiated by various organization such as World Health Organization's DOTS program (Direct Observed Therapy, short course) but are not completely successful to stop the cases of DR-TB. The innovation in development of NFs for infectious disease is by introducing such systems, which could shorten the drug regimen duration, lower the frequency of dosages, improved patience compliance and improve completion rates. Thus the NFs hold great potential in the reduction of drug resistance for many infectious diseases. The versatility in the forms of hydrogels that have been manufactured such as particle form (nanogels), 165 inhalable form, 166 liquid injectable form (intravenous and subcutaneous), 167 as a patch for scaffolds 168 and in oral dosages form 169 make them perfect candidate to be exploited for chemotherapy and drug resistance in infectious diseases. For tuberculosis the nanotechnology based systems allows the increased transcytosis in the gut lumen's M cells which enhance the intracellular uptake in the lining epithelium, and improved uptake in the Peyer's patch. This process reduces the loss of the active anti TB chemical in the bowels prior of entering the bloodstream and radically improve the bioavailability of the drug. 170, 171 The significant features of hydrogels such as particle size and surface can be modulated to avoid the rapid clearance by the phagocytic cells and thus promotes the active and passive targeting of the drug. The design of hydrogels in the form of controlled and sustained release systems improve the therapeutic efficacy and significantly reduce the side effects of the drug. The major advantages of using hydrogel based systems of the NFs to cure infectious diseases is their ability to reach the smallest capillary vessels owing to their tiny volume, porous structure that allow them to penetrate across the tissue by paracellular and transcellular pathways. It is noteworthy that the use of biodegradable polymers like chitosan, cellulose, Polylactic acid, PLGA etc for the synthesis of hydrogels make the NFs backbone completely degradable into compatible monomers which are non -toxic. These polymers owe the feature to be functionalized and have the ability to self-assemble into well-defined particles. Moreover, the nanogels formulations have been reported to show the efficient loading of payloads which is not achieved by the conventional nanotechnology based carriers. 172 NFs have also shown to functions as adjuvants to enhance the immunostimulatory properties of the old vaccines and can increase the immunogenicity of vaccines by activating immune inflammatory reactions which induces memory responses.",

Owing to the tunable structural and functional characteristics of hydrogels obtained by modulating synthesis approach they find great potential as nanocarriers to achieve site-specific drug delivery and release. Recently hydrogels have proven their potentials to develop future personalized nanomedicine to cure infectious diseases. In-spite of significant proven applications of hydrogels to manage infectious diseases, significant efforts should be made to design and develop smart hydrogels in nanodomain with improved characteristics and easy processing needed to develop therapeutics against target diseases. The emphasis to develop injectable hydrogels, nasal sprays and drops should be made for patient compliance. This review is a call to increase such significant efforts to develop hydrogel based therapeutic cargos-specific to target diseases, to be tested using animal model to promote as translational medicine.",
