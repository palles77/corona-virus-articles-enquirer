Of the 18 HRV-A strains, 17 showed close genetic relatedness (80.7%-93.8% nucleotide and 89.6%-98.8% predicted amino acid sequence identity) to HRV prototype strains. One HRV-A strain (GA23584) was highly divergent from the closest prototype, HRV80 (73.2% nucleotide and 73.0% amino acid sequence identity), which suggests that it could represent a distinct previously undescribed HRV. The 3 HRV-B strains were closely related to prototype strains (84.0%-88.6% nucleotide and 89.7%-93.4% predicted amino acid sequence identity). The partial VP1 sequences of genogroup C strains were phylogenetically distinct from HRV species A and B and showed a substantial intragroup diversity (Figure) . VP1 sequence identity of these viruses with the closest match within the same genogroup ranged from 68.4% to 74.6% for nucleotide and from 68.5% to 85.5% for amino acid sequences. These novel viruses were related to other recently described HRVs: HRV-QPM detected in specimens from Australia (4), C024-C026 detected in specimens from Hong Kong (6) , and NAT001 and NAT045 detected in specimens from California (8) (Figure) . Their identity scores compared with HRV-QPM were 66.0%-82.7% for nucleotide and 65.2%-86.9% for amino acid sequences. One of the strains (GA23592) was almost identical in partial VP1 sequence to C026 (Figure) . The degree of genetic diversity among the genogroup C viruses far exceeded that between HRVs defi ned as distinct serotypes by classical serologic methods, which suggests that at least 7 of 8 of these viruses are antigenically distinct from each other rather than minor variants of the same serotype. The genogroup C HRV identity scores were substantially lower when compared with their closest matches from species A and B: 48.2%-51.1% for nucleotide and 38.5%-49.8% for amino acid sequences, and 35.9%-42.8% for nucleotide and 29.3%-35.8% for amino acid sequences, respectively.",

Lower FEV1 with genogroup C infection than with other HRVs suggests a potentially greater severity of asthma exacerbation in patients infected with these HRVs. When one considers the great variation among HRV serotypes in levels of sensitivity to candidate antiviral compounds (12, 13) , genogroup-related differences in associated disease patterns have implications for clinical management of HRV infections in asthma patients and for development of antiviral drugs against HRVs. Preliminary data suggest that HRV-QPM and related HRV-C strains from Hong Kong share certain VP1 sequence characteristics with HRVs that are resistant to a candidate antipicornavirus drug, pleconaril (4, 6, 13) . These data raise the possibility that these novel HRVs might also be resistant to this compound.",
