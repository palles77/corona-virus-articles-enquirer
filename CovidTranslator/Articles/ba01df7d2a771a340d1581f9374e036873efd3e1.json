            "text": "[Keywords: PI3K; genetics screen; synthetic lethality] Supplemental material is available for this article. Received August 31, 2016; revised version accepted December 12, 2016. Devising strategies to selectively kill cancer cells while sparing their wild-type counterparts has been a persistent challenge in cancer drug development (Engelman 2009 ). Selectivity can be achieved by targeting the oncogenic \"driver\" mutations upon which cancer cells become dependent for growth and survival (Jonkers and Berns 2004; Joe 2006, 2008) . For example, tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors are initially efficacious in treating tumors harboring oncogenic receptor TK (RTK) mutations (Paez et al. 2004 ); however, many tumors ultimately become resistant to these drugs (Linardou et al. 2009 ). An alternative approach is to search for genes that exhibit synthetic lethality with oncogenic mutations (Fece de la Cruz et al. 2015) . This approach is based on the concept of nononcogene addiction, which postulates that tumorigenic mutations confer certain critical cellular dependences on the activity of specific genes that are themselves not oncogenes but are required to a greater extent for cell growth and survival in tumor cells relative to wild-type cells (Solimini et al. 2007; Luo et al. 2009 ). This concept broadens the list of potential therapeutic targets beyond the oncogene itself. RNAi screens have been used extensively for the identification of such nononcogenic addictions, although the utility of this approach is often hindered by the inefficiency and off-target effects of reagents (Adamson et al. 2012; Mohr et al. 2014) .",

A key downstream transducer of the PI3K-AKT pathway is the serine-threonine kinase mTOR, whose activation promotes protein synthesis and other anabolic processes (Yuan and Cantley 2008) . mTOR stimulates the translation of specific mRNAs containing highly structured 5 \u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) and 5 \u2032 oligopyrimidine tract mRNAs, encoding cell cycle regulators (such as Cyclin D1 and Myc) and translation factors. It accomplishes this primarily through the phosphorylation of S6K kinase, which enhances translation, and phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of EIF4EBP1/ 2, a negative regulator of translation. Furthermore, by promoting S6K-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor UBF, mTOR increases the rate of rDNA synthesis (Hannan et al. 2003) . More recently, mTOR has been implicated in the promotion of NFE2L1-dependent transcription of proteasomal genes (Zhang et al. 2014) .",

Mutational activation of PI3K outside of this normal regulatory environment is likely to have profound and possibly unbalanced effects on cellular physiology that could produce novel vulnerabilities in tumors. To identify specific vulnerabilities of PI3K mutant tumors, we investigated the genetic dependencies of human cancer cells bearing oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA. Through a meta-analysis of our genome-wide RNAi synthetic lethality screen in isogenic colon cancer cells and large data sets of RNAi-based screens in other cancer cell lines with oncogenic PI3K mutations, we uncovered a particular sensitivity of human cancer cells with oncogenic PI3K hyperactivation to inhibition of ribosomal protein translation and proteasomal protein degradation. By using a gene expression data set from cancer cell lines and human primary tumors, we demonstrate that multiple molecular components of the translation pathway and the proteasome are up-regulated in tumors bearing PI3K mutations. Importantly, a gene expression signature derived from the meta-analysis of our PI3K synthetic-lethal (SL) interactions significantly predicts overall survival in colorectal cancer patients. These results suggest that the disruption of protein turnover homeostasis via ribosome or proteasome inhibition may be an effective treatment strategy for PI3K mutant human tumors.",

Next, by usng the ATA-RIS solutions as quantification of the phenotypic effect of the inhibition of each gene across the two RNAi data sets, we performed a two-class comparison between PI3K Mut and PI3K wild-type cell lines in both data sets (Wilcoxon test) (see the Materials and Methods; Supplemental Tables S4, 5). PI3K Mut cells were defined as those cancer cell lines bearing an oncogenic activating mutation in PIK3CA, while PI3K wild-type cells were defined as those cell lines harboring a wild-type PIK3CA gene that also did not have PI3K-activating mutations or amplifications in KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, AKT1, PTEN, EGFR, or ERBB2 oncogenes (Supplemental Tables S4, S5). As a confirmation of our analysis to identify genes synthetically lethal with PI3K hyperactvation, we found that the PI3K. AKT.mTOR.Activation.Pathway was strongly enriched in both RNAi data sets (Achilles data set: 46% enrichment; COLT-Cancer data set: 84% enrichment) (Supplemental Table S2 ).

In MCAs, depletion of the elongation factor EIF1AX (combined Pvalue = 9 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) to \u223c10%-15% of its endogenous level by two independent shRNAs resulted in a significant selective inhibition of HCT116 PI3K Mut versus wildtype cells compared with two negative control shRNAs targeting Luciferase (Fig. 3F,H; Supplemental Fig. S3D ). Depletion of the ribosomal protein RPL34 (P = 1 \u00d7 10 \u221216 ) had a similar selective decrease in viability for HCT116 PI3K Mut compared with wild-type cells. Additionally, in MCAs, the combination of individual shRNAs targeting EIF1AX with Torin1 and Torin2 did not further increase the selective growth inhibition of PI3K Mut cells versus wild-type compared with treatment with the drugs or EIF1AX shRNAs individually (Fig. 3I) .

Indeed, 10 out of 48 proteasomal genes are contained in the top 10% of the genes ranked by differential overexpression in PTEN \u2212/\u2212 versus PTEN +/+ cells, resulting in an enrichment of 111% over expected (Supplemental Table S9 ).

This increase was mTOR-dependent, since the expression of both genes in PI3K Mut cells was reduced by Torin2 and rapamycin treatment ( Fig. 4B; Supplemental Fig. S4A , B; data not shown).",

Protein synthesis is enhanced and modulated by PI3K activation of the mTOR pathway (Hay and Sonenberg 2004) . Our data suggest that PI3K mutation also enhances protein degradation by the proteasome. These findings are consistent with recent studies that suggest that mTOR activation and a consequent increase in protein synthesis can lead to a concomitant increase in protein degradation that promotes the maintenance of cellular amino acid homeostasis (Zhang et al. 2014) . If this is true, it would predict that the uncoupling of ribosomal protein synthesis from proteasomal protein degradation via the inhibition of either pathway, but not both pathways simultaneously, would compromise cell viability-particularly in the context of mTOR activation. This hypothesis is in agreement with our data showing that simultaneous proteasome and translation inhibition not only did not have a synergistic effect but actually diminished the PI3K-selective vulnerability of inhibiting either pathway alone.",

Interestingly, 4E1RCat, which inhibits CAP-dependent translation by blocking the binding of EIF4G to EIF4E-bound nascent mRNA transcripts, improved the response to chemotherapy in a murine model of EuMyc lymphoma (Cencic et al. 2011) . In contrast, targeting the proteasome has already emerged as a viable strategy for some types of malignancies (Adams 2003) . Bortezomib (Velcade) has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma (http://www.fda. gov). In solid tumors, a number of clinical trials performed in patients with advanced (usually metastatic) tumors did not show a significant benefit of treatment with bortezomib as a single agent (Shah et al. 2004; Yang et al. 2006 ). Among the many potential reasons for inefficacy in these trials are the dose used in the trial, the advanced stage of the disease, and the treatment with bortezomib as a single agent. Furthermore, selection of the patients for the clinical trial, based on tumor molecular markers that may predict the response to a specific agent, is a crucial aspect of new clinical trials for targeted therapy. Our data indicate that the presence of PI3K oncogenic mutations might confer a particular susceptibility to proteasome inhibitors. Additionally, our data suggest that the expression levels of some proteasomal factors might also represent useful molecular biomarkers to identify patients who may benefit from treatment with proteasome inhibitors.",

Among patients with hyperactive PI3K, a gene expression signature derived from PI3K SL hits in colon cancer cell lines significantly correlates with survival. In other words, patients with hyperactive PI3K who show a lower expression of the genes in this defined signature have better survival. Importantly, this expression signature is a significant predictor of survival also in multivariate analysis taking into account the stage of the disease. This result highlights the fact that the PI3K SL genes identified by our analysis also likely represent bona fide SL factors in human tumors. Our findings may also be relevant for wild-type PI3K tumors that harbor other genetic or epigenetic alterations that result in AKT and mTOR pathway activation. Thus, these PI3K SL factors may represent not only biomarkers that can predict patient outcome but also potential therapeutic targets.",

The negative binomial distribution (EdgeR classic method) was used to determine the significance in the relative representation of each shRNA between the end and start populations. The lethality score for each shRNA was defined as the log 10 of the P-value multiplied by the sign corresponding to the direction of the fold change (+1 for genes increasing between start and end population and \u22121 for the opposite behavior). Thus, a positive lethality score corresponds to an shRNA that undergoes a significant drop between the start and the end populations and vice versa for a negative lethality score ( Fig. 1B; Supplemental  Fig. S1 ). Afterward, RIGER KS metrics were applied to the \u0394 lethality score between the PI3K Mut and wild-type cells for each shRNA to determine a synthetic lethality score for each gene in the library. The \u0394 lethality score represented the difference between the lethality score of the PI3K Mut versus wild-type cells.",

For PI3K synthetic lethality, PI3K Mut cells were defined as those cancer cell lines bearing an oncogenic activating PIK3CA mutation, while PI3K wild-type cells were defined as those cell lines having a wild-type PIK3CA gene that also did not have mutations or amplifications in KRAS, HRAS, NRAS, BRAF, AKT1, PTEN, EGFR, or ERBB2 oncogenes.

Tumor sizes were monitored weekly, and volumes were calculated with the following formula: mm 3 = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 width \u00d7 0.5.",
