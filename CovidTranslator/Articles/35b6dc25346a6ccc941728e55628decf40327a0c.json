At hpi 96-120, pig 1 exhibited severe dehydration, loss of bodyweight, and lethargy. Pig 2, which was followed up longer, showed diarrhea until dpi 7. All inoculated pigs exhibited onset of clinical disease similar to that of infection with PEDV strain PC21A (6.3-9.0 log 10 GEs/pig) in gnotobiotic pigs (8) . Immune electron microscopy with hyperimmune serum to PDCoV from a gnotobiotic pig showed only PDCoV particles in the intestinal contents ( Figure 1 ). For pig-passaged OH-FD22 and OH-FD100 samples, RT-PCR results were negative for PEDV, rotavirus groups A-C, TGEV/PRCV, and caliciviruses.

No other internal organs of infected pigs showed in situ hybridization-positive or immunofluorescence-positive staining. In situ hybridization-positive or immunofluorescencestained cells were not detected in negative control pigs (Figure 2 , panels H, L) and PEDV-infected gnotobiotic pigs.

Our data confirm that PDCoV strains OH-FD22 and OH-FD100 are enteropathogenic and acutely infect the entire intestine. However, the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. PDCoV infection caused severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by severe diarrhea, vomiting, or both. These clinical and pathologic features in PDCoV-infected pigs resemble those of PEDV and TGEV infections. Differential diagnosis of PDCoV, PEDV, and TGEV is critical to control virus epidemic diarrhea on swine farms in the United States.
