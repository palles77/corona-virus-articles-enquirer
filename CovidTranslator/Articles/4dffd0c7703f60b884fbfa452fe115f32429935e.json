In the information diffusion process of these super-spreading events, messages are passed on from one user to another and numerous individuals are influenced by a relatively small portion of users, a.k.a. super-spreaders. Acquiring an awareness of super-spreading phenomena and an understanding of patterns of wide-ranged information propagations benefits several social media data mining tasks, such as hot topic detection, predictions of information propagation, harmful information monitoring and intervention. Taking into account that super-spreading in both information diffusion and spread of a contagious disease are analogous, in this study, we build a parameterized model, the SAIR model, based on well-known epidemic models to characterize super-spreading phenomenon in tweet information propagation accompanied with super-spreaders. For the purpose of modeling information diffusion, empirical observations on a real-world Weibo dataset are statistically carried out. Both the steady-state analysis on the equilibrium and the validation on real-world Weibo dataset of the proposed model are conducted. The case study that validates the proposed model shows that the SAIR model is much more promising than the conventional SIR model in characterizing a super-spreading event of information propagation. In addition, numerical simulations are carried out and discussed to discover how sensitively the parameters affect the information propagation process.",

In the circumstance of follower-followee relationship between microblog users, one user transmits a message to his followers simply by reposting this message, and then the information is distributed instantaneously point-to-surface. After the awareness of some non-ordinary stories, various behaviors of participants' on OSNs lead to many kinds of information diffusion patterns: a small group of users remain silent and just being onlookers; the majority will pass the news on, in the same way that they are influenced by each other and this behavior is mocked, recognized as Herd Behavior [5] ; meanwhile, only a very few individuals will transmit the news and influence a very vast coverage of crowds of users than normal users would do, and this minority should be referred to as super-spreaders, and this kind of information propagation should be viewed as a super-spreading event. In most cases, super-spreaders are generally opinion leaders, or those who have quantities of followers on microblog platforms, though sometimes not vice versa.",

Although the probability that one individual user would retweet a piece of message relates to his interests and intention, crowds of users would not resist telling others about uncommon stories from a macroscopic perspective. This pattern corresponds to an individual's infection caused by a contagion, who contacted by an infectious person will get infected, even though some are immune to such a contagion. The emerging super-spreaders and the consequent super-spreading phenomenon in a social media scheme are also both analogous to the respective connotations in the field of epidemiology. In epidemiology, the term super-spreader [8, 9] refers to a host that infects disproportionally more secondary contacts than others who have also been infected with the same virus or bacteria. Correspondingly in information propagation, a super-spreading story will spread in a notably large range on OSNs through a minor portion of users. Cases in disease spreading mostly conform the 20/80 rule [9] , where approximately 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of disease transmissions. Comparably, situations in information diffusion commonly comply the rule of 1% [10] in Internet culture, in which 1% of users contribute to the distribution mostly, while the other 99% spread little.",

[11] modeled information diffusion in implicit networks through a simple linear model, which can be utilized to quantify and predict the influence of users, and inspired us. But their model does not fit quantitative analysis of characterizing super-spreading phenomena. Lerman et al. [6] are the first to characterize the spread of news on OSNs by using epidemic models. Then, Abdullah et al. [7] formulated a clear epidemic-based model for news spreading on Twitter, following whom, there have been several studies based on epidemic models. The simple but operational and adoptable epidemic method of modeling is exploited to track trending topics, rumors and generic information on OSNs. These information propagation models are modified based on conventional epidemic models, such as the SIR model, the SEIR model, etc. Based on the SIR model, Li et al. [12] considered various kinds of user behaviors on Weibo and divide users into four groups with different transition rates between groups. Meng et al. [13] added a new compartment into the conventional SIR model in order to catch the phenomenon of rumor spreading in real life. Xia et al. [14] introduced a new class representing authorities that can diffuse authoritative information to prevent rumors from spreading. Zhao et al. [15, 16] modified the SIR model to integrate forgetting and remembering mechanisms with variable forgetting rate to catch rumor dissemination characteristics. Zhou et al. [4] studied the characteristics of ''information bomb'' by leveraging a modified SIR model, which include influence breadth and strength of dynamic of information diffusion. Work by Xu et al. [17] and Zhao et al. [18] took into account complex network features to model information dissemination in mobile social networks and rumor spreading in the new media age, respectively. Zhang et al. [19] introduced a latent group of users who would be infected by an infectious individual, become latent and later then infectious. Although none of them addressed the super-spreading phenomena that benefits the information diffusion cascades on OSNs, previous work has shed light on the modeling of super-spreading.",

Moreover, many infectious diseases were reported as super-spreading events [21] , i.e., observed infections unveiled evident heterogeneities in pathogen transmission, with some individuals exhibiting a higher ability to infect others. An epidemic compartmental model, SIPR, was proposed to model the super-spreading events during SARS [22] . By splitting the infected people into two classes with different ''removal'' rates, a normal class I for normal infectious individuals and a new class P that stands for super-spreaders, the SIPR model can capture the effect of super-spreaders during the SARS outbreaks in Hong Kong. But due to its focus on particular infectious disease spread, this epidemic model cannot be easily modified to model information propagation. After all, we will build a new model based on the conventional SIR model to accomplish this task.",

            "text": "For the effectiveness criterion, we will see if we can infer the diffusion network of each tweet from the data. It is worth noting that the components and text content of a retweet on Weibo differs from that on Twitter. Unlike Twitter, a retweeter can add some opinions when he reposts the retweet on Weibo, and he will usually keep any text content that already added by previous retweeters. Trails implying the message propagation path from previous retweeters will be generated automatically by Weibo system whenever a post is retweeted, in the form of ''@userC: Repost // @userB: {content_added_by_userB} // @userA: {content_added_by_userA}''. Through this structural form, we know that a tweet posted by an initial user has been reposted by userA, then userB reposts the retweet of userA, and finally userC is the last one to retweet. In this way, we can state that the initial user influenced userA, userA influenced userB, and finally userB influenced userC. Thus, the networks of information diffusion can be extracted from the dataset via all trails like this. In a diffusion network, nodes are users who repost (except the author of the initial tweet), and every directed edge indicates which user reposts whose retweet. Fig. 1 (a) demonstrates an example of the diffusion network of a tweet information propagation. This tweet 2 leads to 1003 retweets influencing 945 users. From this figure, it clearly demonstrates that most of the nodes have no child or at most only one child except the initial node (the author of the initial tweet). However, several nodes emit more edges than the others, and we call them super-spreaders. As for the initial node, the author user of the original tweet, he influences a vast range of users, obviously. Fig. 1(b) shows the distribution of out-degrees of nodes (the initial user excluded) in the example diffusion network shown in Fig. 1(a) . In the diffusion network, nodes are users who repost the tweet, and these nodes have different outdegrees, i.e., the number of users influenced by each user is varied. According to records of this tweet, there are 42 nodes (users), each of which emits greater than or equal to 5 edges, totally influenced 253 nodes; and 18 nodes, every of which emits more than 10 edges, influenced 168 nodes in this diffusion network. The observed data points of this tweet approximate a power-law distribution as shown in Fig. 1(b) . For the entire dataset, the distribution of user influenced counts is depicted in Fig. 2 , in which the distribution shows a long-tail shape that is common in real-world social networks. This distribution suggests that the majority of users influence relatively small portion of other users, and relatively large amounts of users are influenced by a minority of users. In more detailed investigations, we find that the majority of highly retweeted posts share the same trait as demonstrated in the example.",

Meanwhile, the corresponding distributions of users in each category are illustrated in sub-figures (g)-(l), respectively. Furthermore, Fig. 4 illustrates the influence range of users with distinct C infl . In every sub-figure, each point represents a diffusion. It is especially evident that users of C infl = 0 have always influenced no one, as shown in Fig. 4 (a). Other than this case, there always exists situations where the information propagation is achieved by only one type of users, as denoted by the points with value 1 in y-axis in other sub-figures.

This causes their contacts to be exposed to higher viral/bacterial loads than would be seen in the contacts of non-super-spreaders within the same duration of exposure [24] . As a result of aforementioned observations in this Weibo dataset, it is found that in information diffusion, there also exists superspreading event and super-spreaders (users with C infl \u2265 5). To discover the role behavior of super-spreaders, the traditional epidemic-based models may be modified to address the super-spreading phenomena. In this Weibo dataset, it is observed that if a tweet is posted by a verified user, it usually has a high retweet count, which is consistent with the conclusion of a detailed analysis on Weibo user behavior [25] ; while if a tweet is posted by a casual user, but has been retweeted by some verified users, it still has a high retweet count. Hence, we assume super-spreaders in information propagation are these verified users intuitively, and modify the traditional SIR model correspondingly.

Since the total population has a fixed number, r increases proportionally to i. Let Eqs. (10)-(13) be 0, solutions of equilibrium will be obtained. Thus it follows that the equilibria are (s, a, i, r) e = (1, 0, 0, 0) that is a non-diffusible equilibrium (disease-free equilibrium in epidemiology) we will not put analysis on, and (s, a, i, r) e = (s e , 0, 0, r e ) for any s e \u2265 0, r e > 0 with s e + r e = 1 after a super-spreading event. One equilibrium shows that a certain number of individuals remain susceptible (s e > 0), which greatly depends on initial conditions and adjustments of parameters [33] . Although this scenario does exist in the modeling of a disease spread, the number of susceptible individuals in a real event is difficult to be precisely quantified. Furthermore, let us consider a tweet message diffusion on OSNs, the entire population involved in a super-spreading event is a very large quantity of users. But relatively very few users remain unaware of that information after a vast extent of diffusion (remaining users in the S compartment), therefore the fraction of this class can approximately be 0. Furthermore, analyzing zero solution is sufficient, since problems having nonzero solutions can be converted to a modified problem where zero solution is used to analyze the corresponding stability problem [34] .

To establish the connection between the realworld scenario and the mathematic model introduced in Section 3.3, we roughly recognize normal retweeters as elements of the I compartment, verified users as components of the A compartment, assuming that verified users act as super-spreaders. In order to find out the most suitable parameters in the SAIR model to characterize the real-world information propagation of this tweet, and compare the performance of it with the conventional SIR model reviewed in Section 3.2, an objective function is proposed as follows,",

From the simulation, we can find that there is a sharp increase in the number of users in the I compartment in the early stage of the information propagation, which indicates that the SAIR model captures the swift eruption of massive emergence of retweeters (influenced users). As information propagates, the number of influenced individuals reaches a peak and then declines. Finally, the density of compartment I comes down to zero, when this tweet stops spreading on Weibo. During the entire process, it should be noted that the density of the S compartment decreases quickly as the fraction of the I compartment increases. This is because the susceptible users in compartment S quickly transit into either super-spreaders in compartment A or normal infectious spreader in compartment I. As for the A compartment, super-spreaders take up only a small fraction of the whole population but lead the information propagation which can be found in the case study in Section 4.1.",

            "text": "Although the recovery rate \u03b3 is not introduced by the new A compartment, i.e., this rate is inherited from the SIR model, it always fairly affects the information propagation. The pattern of information diffusion with different \u03b3 is similar to the depictions in study [37] . However, the conclusion in this study drawn by Su has some flaws with the underlying truth we observed. Fig. 14 demonstrates the percentage change of each compartment with varied \u03b3 . The range of \u03b3 is from 0 to 2 with step size 0.04. As demonstrated in Fig. 14(a) and (b) , compartments S and A have little change with a varied \u03b3 . It is consistent with the statement made by Su et al. in Ref. [37] , where they argue that the recovery rate does not cause dramatic changes if it varies, and this rate cannot significantly affect the information propagation process. However, our study draws a different conclusion. As shown in Fig. 14(c) , a tuning \u03b3 significantly affects the curve pattern of compartment I similarly to that of compartment A caused by varied \u03b5 (cf. Fig. 13(b) ): the larger the rate \u03b3 is, the lower the peak of the fraction of compartment I is, and the faster it drops after reaching the peak, which implies that if users recover at a high rate (lose interest of a tweet fast), the information diffusion terminates early. For the R compartment shown in Fig. 14(d) , the number of it raises sluggishly if this rate is small, but eventually reaches the equilibrated state as long as \u03b3 > 0.",

The mechanism of super-spreading phenomena in information propagation is discussed, and the notion of super-spreader in information propagation is defined with the help of corresponding definition in epidemiology field. Based on the empirical observation result from real-world Weibo dataset of tweets diffusion, an A compartment characterizing super-spreaders is introduced into the conventional epidemic model, and a parameterized model SAIR is built to characterize super-spreading phenomena of tweet information propagation. A case study of fitting to real world dataset is conducted, and parameter settings are obtained for both the SAIR model and the SIR model. Through comparison between fitted results of both models, the SAIR model is validated to show much more promising to characterize a super-spreading event of information propagation than the conventional one. In addition, numerical simulations are carried out to discover the sensitivity of parameters.",

Another potential extension to our work would be considering the temporal variations of parameters. Not only the recency of burst news is time dependent, but the behavior of users is also time concerning. It has been observed that users on Weibo are more active in the daylight time of China than in the nighttime, which would affect the information spreading pattern. Furthermore, large scale real-world data can be fitted with our proposed model in order to fulfill the task of information influence breadth and strength analysis, information propagation intervention and control, etc.",
