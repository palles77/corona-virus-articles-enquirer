An underdeveloped and underutilized area in microbial forensics is how the host interacts with microorganisms in a way that provides unique signatures for forensic use. For forensic purposes, an immediate goal is to distinguish a potential victim and innocent person from a perpetrator, and to distinguish between a naturally acquired or intentional infection. Two principal methods that are sufficiently developed are characterization of the humoral immune response and identification of vaccine-induced immunity or antibiotics that may be present in a possible perpetrator.",

            "text": "The primary aims of a microbial forensics are to identify the biological agent, its source, and the individuals responsible for the event (Budowle et al., 2003) . Analytic approaches differ when the suspected biothreat agent is encountered in a container or the environment, as opposed to in vivo in a human, animal, or plant. Analyses of trace elements, pollens, growth media, latent fingerprints, and microbial and nonmicrobial nucleic acids are all applicable to the container and environmental sample (States et al., 1999) . However, once the microorganism or its toxin is in the living host, it is no longer possible to analyze the preceding items except the microbial nucleic acid. However, the host's response to the biological agent may be available for analysis for clues. This is akin to other forensic studies where physical traces of bite marks, scratches, wound trajectories, and sizes of wounds are often surrogate evidence of the teeth, fingernails, and bullets (Averill and Odontology, 1991) . While the forensic pathologist is familiar with evidence related to determining the manner of death including the host response, those involved with healthcare alone are more familiar with the host response. In the context of microbial forensics, it is important to integrate all of these with intelligence information so that they may be included in the analytical data and attribution picture.",

            "text": "The host response to a microorganism or other foreign substance is often a wellorchestrated series of events, which may protect the individual from harm (Zabriskie, 2009 ). At the same time, these host responses may provide clues as to identity of the offending microorganism or toxin as well as a rough chronology of when it occurred and for how long it has been persisting. Emerging technologies such as transcriptional arrays and bioinformatic analysis will eventually be refined and methods validated to provide even greater help in delineating more of the pathways and components of the host response to an infectious agent (Sala et al., 2009; Popper et al., 2009; Ko et al., 2015) . Other technologies are sufficiently mature to be of use today. The immune system and its components are a mainstay of our protection against infections and malignancies (Zabriskie, 2009; Paul, 2008; Murphy and Weaver, 2016) . Inflammation is often a side effect as the immune system contains and eradicates a microorganism or eliminates foreign tissue. Specific arms of the immune system can be used as markers in support of or against the presence of an infection. The humoral or antibody response to an invading microorganism is one example of a specific arm that can have forensic value. Some of the antibodies produced may have a protective role together with other parts of the immune system by eradicating the pathogen or neutralizing a toxin. Other antibodies may not be as effective in this role. However, in their ability to recognize unique and specific microbial antigens, they can serve as indicators that a specific microorganism was recently present or was present in the past. In the case of a vaccine, specific antibodies may recognize highly specific epitopes of one microbe versus those of a related microbe (e.g., influenza virus). This is especially so with different recombinant vaccines and could have forensic importance. Substances such as antibiotics, which can rapidly kill a pathogen, may modify the immune response by removing or reducing the infectious driving force for a full-scale response. As noted above, in clinical and veterinary medicine, measurement of the immune response helps the diagnostician decide what infection was present and how recently. In these situations, the intent is to provide treatment. The forensic scientist may exploit parts of the immune response to discover who is likely a victim of an attack and who might be responsible. This chapter will discuss the basics of the host immune response in a simplified manner that can have utility in a forensic sense. Examples will provide a sense of what information is achievable and what is 14. The use of host factors in microbial forensics not likely to provide clues with a high degree of certainty.",

In an infection, immunoglobulins usually appear in the order of IgM, IgG, and IgA. B cells first begin to produce IgM, and then some B cells undergo an irreversible switch to those that produce IgG. Later, some of these B cells undergo a switch to become IgA-secreting B cells. Immunoglobulins persist for varying times; for example, the half-life of particular IgM antibodies is approximately 5 days, while that of IgG can be as long as 21e23 days (Table 14 .1) (Paul, 2008; Murphy and Weaver, 2016) .",

It is rare to find IgG antibody to the VCA or to EpsteineBarr nuclear acid (EBNA) in anything but low titers (levels).

The controlled experiment may be in a laboratory animal or a patient Illustrative concepts receiving a booster vaccine. The uncontrolled but normal clinical event occurs when the patient is reexposed to the infectious agent. Consider a generic antigen exposure. The first time the immune system encounters antigen X (AgX), it responds as shown in Figs. 14.1 and 14.2. Initially, antibodies to AgX are barely discernible; then levels rise and later fall to a plateau. If a simultaneous exposure were to occur with AgX and a new AgY from another microorganism, the immune system would quickly mount a brisk response with high levels of Ab to AgX, while the course of Ab to AgY would be slow and delayed, just as it was in the response to the first exposure to AgX. This phenomenon is termed immunological memory or an amnestic response. This can be useful when the symptoms and signs of exposure to either X or Y are similar. This is the case with the early flu-like symptoms of pulmonary anthrax (Raymond et al., 2009; Waterer and Robertson, 2009; Bush et al., 2001) and with the influenza virus itself (Meltzer et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2009; Lessler et al., 2009) .",

Three years later, the same individual exposed to a partially similar influenza virus responds preferentially to those antigens that were also present on the original influenza virus. The person also makes a smaller initial antibody response to new antigens, that is, those not shared with the first virus. Ten or 20 years later, during a new flu season and exposure to a third strain of influenza, the most brisk responses would be to antigens previously recognized by the immune system. This is the scientific basis for giving the flu vaccine, which contains a variety of possible antigens common to multiple strains of the flu virus so that a rapid and protective antibody response will occur.

The chest X-ray showed a leftsided pneumonia and a small left pleural effusion but no \"classical\" mediastinal widening (Dewan et al., 2002) . The patient was initially given intravenous azithromycin; cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin were subsequently added. A nasal swab obtained on October 5 grew Bacillus anthracis on culture. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed bilateral effusions and multilobar pulmonary consolidation but still no significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pleural fluid aspiration was positive for B. anthracis DNA by PCR. Bacterial cultures of bronchial washings and pleural fluid were negative. Immunohistochemical staining of a transbronchial biopsy demonstrated the presence of B. anthracis capsule and cell wall antigens. During hospitalization, his white blood count rose to 26,800/mm 3 , and fluid from a second thoracentesis was positive for B. anthracis DNA by PCR. Immunohistochemical staining of both pleural fluid cells and pleural biopsy tissue demonstrated the presence of B. anthracis capsule and cell wall antigens. Serial serum samples demonstrated > fourfold rise in serum IgG antibody to the PA component of the anthrax toxins by an ELISA assay.

These questions include was the infection acquired naturally or was it an intentional action that led to the infection; how did the particular individual acquire it if it was not a natural infectiondwas he the target or a bystander. An alternative possibility in the right circumstances is a laboratory-acquired infection. This case also demonstrates that cultures may be negative at different times from different fluids and tissues because of early administration of antibiotics. However, the remnants of the infection, even dead organisms, can be found by probing for antigens and DNA. This patient's response demonstrated a classic principle of infectious disease, a rising antibody titer over time. In this case, it was IgG to a particular antigenic component of the anthrax toxins (Friedlander and Little, 2009; Cunningham et al., 2002) . The subject's antibody response may have been detected earlier if IgM to this component or to other antigens of anthrax had been sought. The case also points out the utility of integrating the presence of antibody with other indications of an anthrax infection such as culture, PCR, and antigen detection. These take on their greatest significance during clinical illness in someone who was possibly exposed.",

Beginning on October 29, 2001, 1657 postal employees and others who had been to the Washington D.C. postal facility went to the D.C. General Hospital for antibiotics in addition to those people whose treatment began on October 21, 2001. Serum samples were also obtained from the 202 individuals who had been to the Washington D.C. postal facility during the precious 2 weeks. All were negative for specific anti-PA IgG, including three individuals who reported a remote history of anthrax vaccination. The consistent negative findings may be explained by the fact that antibiotic therapy was initiated before serum testing and that there were no baseline serum samples available for testing. In addition, the time period from exposure to sampling was very short. Among 28 individuals in the Capitol region with culture-positive nasal swabs who received prophylactic antibiotics immediately, none had a positive culture from a nasal swab repeated 7 days later, and none developed IgG to PA antigen 42 days after exposure. This again emphasizes the limitation and interpretation of a test in someone who had early antibiotic treatment. It does raise forensic utility considerations. Even with these easily disseminated spores, an antibody response may be aborted or modified with antibiotics by early eradication. Furthermore, antibiotics taken before exposure would likely be effective in preventing laboratory and clinical signs of an infection. Detection of microbial DNA, antigen, or the organism itself on a person's body, clothing, or possessions should raise a red flag for exposure.",

The population of Guangdong Province is 86.42 million (2001), of whom 61.14 million are adults over age 14. If we assume that the seropositivity rates among controls is representative of the province as a whole, 734,000 to 1,773,000 adults in Guangdong have at some time been infected by the SARS virus. These figures are 87-to 211-fold the total number (8422) of SARS patients reported worldwide to date!\" This comparison is a good illustration of the advantage of open dissemination and discussion of information as well as the need to question the methodology of acquisition of data before accepting their application in formulas or for analyses for forensics and epidemiology.

Analytic techniques could include genomic analysis of an isolated organism and immunological response of the host. In the new era of rapid and deep sequencing, our capacity to investigate the genomics is growing (Mardis, 2008; Stavnsbjerg et al., 2017) . In consideration of animal reservoirs, ELISA assays were compared with other tests for detection of plague antibody and antigen in multimammate mice (Mastomys coucha and. Mastomys natalensis) (Shepherd et al., 1986) , which were experimentally infected and then sacrificed at daily intervals. IgG ELISA was equivalent in sensitivity to passive hemagglutination and more sensitive than the IgM ELISA and complement fixation. Antibody was detectable by Day 6 after infection using all four tests. IgM ELISA titers fell to undetectable levels after 8 weeks. Plague fraction 1 antigen was detected in 16 of 34 bacteremic sera from M. coucha and M. natalensis. This antibody pattern comparison shows that the principle of IgM versus IgG to this pathogen works to temporally situate the infection as an early versus late or past event. It also shows that when the information is combined with antigen detection, it engenders more confidence in the results. It should be noted that conclusions from this older reference has been substantiated with more defined antigens and assay technologies.",

            "text": "Melioidosis is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei (Ashdown, 1992) . Key clinical signs and laboratory results may raise the possibility of an infection with this pathogen. Whether it is an acute, persistent, or past infection can be determined by assessing several host responses. Often a simple indicator such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP) can raise a clinical suspicion of an infection. In a study of 46 patients with clinical melioidosis, 35 (22 culture-positive and 13 culturenegative) had relatively uneventful disease courses. Initially, they had elevated serum CRP that decreased with antibiotic therapy and returned to normal as the disease resolved. In another series of patients, IgM and IgG were measured by ELISA in 95 sera from 66 septicemic cases and 47 sera from 20 cases with localized melioidosis (Chenthamarakshan et al., 2001) . Sixty-five sera from culture-negative cases seronegative for other endemic infections but suspected of melioidosis were also examined. Other controls included serum from 260 nonmelioidosis cases, 169 high-exposure risk cases, and 48 healthy individuals. The IgG-ELISA was 96% sensitive and 94% specific. All sera from cases with septicemic and localized infections and 61 of 63 sera from clinically suspected melioidosis cases were positive for IgG antibody. The sensitivity and specificity of the IgM ELISA were 74% and 99%, respectively. A geometric antibody index for IgM antibody in the sera of the melioidosis cases was significantly higher in cases compared with that of the noncase controls. In another study by some of the same authors, a rapid test for IgG and IgM was shown to have clinical utility (Cuzzubbo et al., 2000) . A study with the intent of evaluating the utility of an IgG assay compared with other assays illustrates how the clinical and temporal context must be integrated for interpretation (Dharakul et al., 1997) . It also illustrates how there is room for technical improvement in tests but the best setting is often the endemic area itself or at least using samples from that area in which the infections are occurring. These tests were evaluated in the actual clinical setting in an area endemic for melioidosis. Specificity of IgG (82.5%) and IgM (81.8%) assays was significantly better than that of an indirect hemagglutination test (IHA) (74.7%). The sensitivity of the IgG assay (85.7%) was higher than that of the IHA test (71.0%) and the IgM test (63.5%). Specific IgG was found in septicemic cases (87.8%) and localized infections (82.6%). The IgG test was also better than the IgM test and the IHA test in identifying acute melioidosis cases in the first 5 days after admission. IgG antibody to a B. pseudomallei antigen remained high for longer than 5 years in recovered, disease-free patients. Because this is a disease that may have an incubation of days to years, an acute case may very well be detected by a rise in specific IgM if it were a matter of days from infection. Although endemic for Southeast Asia, if B. pseudomallei was used as a biothreat agent in a different environment, its course and manifestations may not be recognized due to unfamiliarity with the disease.",

The concept of predictive value is instructive in determining how useful a test may be. In terms of disease detection, a high positive predictive value indicates the test is useful in determining that the disease is present. A high negativity predictive value would indicate that the test is useful in excluding the presence of the disease. Another zoonotic agent is Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which can be transmitted via aerosols (Clark et al., 2018) . One study with the intent at looking for improved tests showed the utility of IgM to determine an early exposure to RVFV (Niklasson et al., 1984) . Two ELISA IgM tests detected specific IgM antibodies to RVFV during the first 6 weeks after vaccination. Three inactivated vaccine doses were given on days 0, 6 to 8, and 32 to 34. ELISA serum IgM on days 6e8 were negative or in the lower range of detection; on days 32e34 the serum antibody values were strongly positive; on days 42e52, they were waning and in later collected samples were negative. The plaque reduction neutralization test was negative on days 6e8 and became positive in later samples. Similar to the examples shown above, these data suggest that three doses of RVFV vaccine induced a prolonged primary antibody response. The authors of that study concluded that the ELISA IgM may be useful for early diagnosis of acute human infection. Good correlation of a neutralization test and ELISA IgG would indicate a later infection.",

On one extreme is the situation that occurred with the onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) from the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) in the United States. Initially, there were no cases, and therefore a precise highly sensitive and specific test with excellent positive and negative predictive values (such as exists now when a combination of tests are used) would not likely yield a positive result in an area where there was little HIV infection and disease at the onset such as Kansas. A positive test by today's methodologies from a 1970 serum sample from Kansas would be considered a probable falsepositive and warrant further investigation. Today, several viral and nucleic acid assays are available that would provide a definitive diagnosis in a short period of time (Bennett et al., 2015) . However the same sample tested at the beginning of HIV testing could have been positive if the person had adult T-cell leukemia, which is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) because the original tests for what became known as AIDS involved whole viral lysates in which up to 30% of the HTLV-1 sera cross-reacted. Questions regarding the interpretation of the test results could be raised by knowledge of different presentations of the infection. For example, HTLV-1 can actually be used in the laboratory to immortalize cells. In the patient, it actually increases the T-cell count, as is the nature with leukemia, instead of decreasing them, as with HIV infections. Other laboratory indicators such as hypercalcemia would now raise the leukemia as a consideration.",

This is important for the practice of medicine and can have relevance when extended to forensic analysis (Schutzer et al., 2005) . The following examples illustrate this concept. Individuals who have syphilis, a treponemal bacterial infection, can typically have a positive fluorescent treponemal antibody test result for years, even after successful treatment. However, while infected they would have a positive venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, which reverts to negative following successful antibiotic therapy. The VDRL test detects nonspecific anticardiolipid antibodies and can produce false-positive results with other conditions (e.g., pregnancy). There are some notable exceptions related to crossreactive epitopes or autoimmune diseases. These are readily distinguishable by history and clinical information. Similarly, individuals infected with active tuberculosis will likely have a positive skin test (Mantoux) or a positive interferon-gamma release assay (Dewan et al., 2006; Ota and Kato, 2017) , whereas the uninfected healthy person will be negative. In certain instances, a sick person with a cell-mediated immune deficiency will be anergic, that is, he/she will be negative to multiple skin tests including common antigens such as Candida. The key difference here is that there is a great difference between the healthy person being tested and an ill or immunocompromised individual being subjected to the same test.",

However, if this case had occurred as the index case or out of context of the mail attacks, it would have been reasonable to question her travel history, what her work if any was, or if she received or used spore-contaminated products from an anthrax endemic area. Similarly, the Vietnamese woman who died of inhalation anthrax in New York City would also have had these questions investigated. It would have been useful to search for direct or indirect evidence of anthrax by physical examinations of her contacts or close neighbors. Inspection and cultures from her workplace, apartment, and apartment complex (especially contiguous neighbors) are important for detecting the presence of B. anthracis. Coworkers, friends, neighbors, and other contacts could have had their serum analyzed for antibody to antigens of B. anthracis. These samples could have been frozen so that if one were positive it would be available for a comparison study in the future. At a minimum, these types of studies could serve as future control data for the geographic region. With molecular methods, even trace amounts might be detectable (Lasken and Egholm, 2003) although parallel investigation as to background control would be necessary.

This individual could conceivably be the one who knowingly or unknowingly passed the spores to the patient. Given the October 26 onset of illness, which is late in the mailing sequence, it would be less likely that this individual was a perpetrator but rather a recent victim. However, if this person were IgG-positive, then there are several other possibilities. Perhaps, this person had past exposure in an endemic region and was treated (e.g., Haiti, where anthrax is known as \"charcoal disease\"). Or this person could have been vaccinated for bona fide reasons such as a researcher who received it for occupational exposure. Or this person could have obtained the vaccine originally for legitimate or illegal purposes but was nevertheless vaccinated. The vaccine usage may have been for a clinical trial or animal experimentation. Animal vaccines may be more obtainable without strict record keeping. This person could have loaded the mail with relative impunity if there was protective antibody generated from the vaccination. Situations similar to this one will require intelligence information regarding access, ability, and motive. In an area where recombinant vaccines are being developed or used antibody response would be different between someone using one type of recombinant vaccine as compared with someone using another type of vaccine. Nevertheless, finding IgG to one or more antigens of B. anthracis could point investigators toward such a seropositive individual, whereas an IgM finding could justify critical therapy. Where information points to a particular individual, investigation could be extended to search for ingestion or injection of antibiotics as illustrated below in the ciprofloxacin example. Questions would be raised regarding access to antibiotics, recent ingestion/injection of them, half-life of the antibiotic, half-life of the metabolites of the antibiotics, and in which body fluids or tissues can the residual be found. As illustrated from 14. The use of host factors in microbial forensics the data in the earlier sections, someone with antibiotics in their system may be protected following exposure to a potential pathogen. This person would be antibody-negative and likely antigen-and microbial DNA/RNAnegative, because the infection would have been eradicated before the organism can proliferate in any significant quantity. The widespread prophylactic use of ciprofloxacin during the period following the anthrax mailing attacks is illustrative of an understudied area. Ciprofloxacin has been increasingly associated with tendonitis and ruptured Achilles tendons (Akali and Niranjan, 2008; Palin and Gough, 2006; Godoy-Santos et al., 2018) . In the future, better methodology to follow the pharmacokinetics of an antiinfective compound may have forensic implications. In the last example, someone who takes an antibiotic prophylactically while manipulating a lethal microbe may exhibit side effects that in the proper context of an investigation may add to the picture of possible culpability.
