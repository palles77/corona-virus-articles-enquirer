It was originally used for the prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and could also be used to treat influenza due to their common pathomechanism. To elucidate the unclear pharmacodynamic basis of JD, the LC-QExactive-MS system was used to qualitatively analyze its main components in this study. As a result, 89 compounds were identified and 24 important ones were selected thereby to further perform the simultaneous quantification in 8 batches of JD samples using LC-QTrap-MS with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Based on the qualitative and quantitative results in combination with the bioactivities reported, 16 compounds including orientin, 2\u2033-O-\u03b2-l-galactopyranosylorientin, puerarin, trollisin I, rosmarinic acid, 2\u2033-O-(2\u2032\u2033-methylbutanoyl) isoswertisin, daidzin, scutellarin, 3\u2032-methoxy puerarin, vitexin, 3\u2032-hydroxy puerarin, 2\u2033-O-(2\u2032\u2033-methylbutanoyl) vitexin, kaempferol, caffeic acid, 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid, and cynaroside were determined as the major components of JD. This study provides a useful combinational method for analyzing the major pharmacodynamic substances of JD and lays a foundation for the quality control research of the decoction.",

            "text": "Jinlianhua decoction (JD) is a prescription for the prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) issued by State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 2003. It is an aqueous decoction made of Flos Trollii (the flowers of Trollius chinensis), Herba Taraxaci (the whole plant of Taraxacum mongolicum), Folium Isatidis (the leaves of Isatis indigotica), Radix Puerariae Lobatae (the roots of Pueraria lobata), and Folium Perillae (the leaves of Perilla frutescens) in a ratio of 6:15:10:10:6. The entire prescription has efficacies of clearing away heat and toxic material, and dispelling wind and pathogen, and thus can be used for the treatment of Fengwen disease. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Fengwen is a group of warm diseases caused by exogenous evils of wind and heat, which occurs in the warm and windy spring or in the late winter. It starts with fever, cold intolerance, headache, cough and other mild pulmonary symptoms. In addition to SARS, influenza in western medicine or so-called seasonal cold in Chinese medicine also belongs to the category of warm diseases [1] . In Chinese medicine, the treatment of warm diseases not only focuses on direct elimination of influenza virus, but also highlights the relationship among virus, organism and drug. Thus, dialectical treatment through improving the state of human body and regulating its capacity of disease resistance is preferred. Studies have shown that the abnormal increase of various inflammatory cytokines 1 3 as the influenza virus infects the body is the basis of immune damage [2] . TCM not only directly inhibits the replication of influenza virus, but also protects the human body from the damage caused by the virus through regulating the expression of inflammatory factors and the immune network in the body [3] . It is well known that the pharmacological actions of TCM are closely related to its chemical composition. In the previous studies, we have confirmed the anti-influenza effect of JD [4] , and have quantitatively analyzed a part of the components in this decoction by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [5] . However, this is not enough for elucidation of its effective substances because the efficacy of TCM is the result of synergistic effects of multiple effective components [6] . Consequently, the comprehensive study of the composition of JD is of great significance for revealing its acting mechanism.",

UHPLC tandem quadrupole-electrostatic field orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QExactive-MS) system with high-throughput scanning and multiple detection capabilities can provide high-quality mass spectra and accurate molecular weight of compounds. It has been applied to multi-component microanalysis, so as to realize the separation and qualitative detection of the compounds in complex systems [7] . Another technique quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometry (QTrap), which uses a multiple reaction monitoring information-dependent acquisitionenhanced product ion scanning (MRM-IDA-EPI) detection mode [8] , can obtain the high-quality MS/MS spectra of parent ions in the corresponding MRM channel to double characterize the unknown compounds and improve the accuracy of the qualitative analysis. Furthermore, it also can use the high-selectivity and high-sensitivity MRM scan to obtain the peak area of the compounds for quantitative analysis. In view of this, we used LC-QExactive-MS and LC-QTrap-MS to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the constituents of JD, respectively, to provide a basis for the determination of pharmacodynamic substance basis. In addition, we used morphological identification in combination with DNA barcoding technique [9] to identify the crude drugs used in the preparation of JD decoction.",

The qualitative analysis was performed using LC-QExactive-MS under high resolution and high sensitivity. Based on the resultant precise molecular weight, and mass spectrometry fragmentation of the compounds, the composition of JD has been comprehensively explained. The quantitative analysis was conducted by LC-QTrap-MS. This method is fast and efficient, and does not require complete separation of the chromatographic peaks of multiple components. The precision, repeatability, stability and recovery for the assigned compounds excluding indirubin are in well compliance with the measurement requirements.

            "text": "Qualitative and quantitative analyses of JD prepared from eight batches of crude drugs obtained from various places of China were carried out by the above methods. The qualitative results showed that JD mainly contains 89 compounds, and most of them belong to flavonoids, phenolic acids and alkaloids. After these compounds were screened on the basis of their bioactivities related to the efficacy of JD, 24 compounds including 16 flavonoids, 7 phenolic acids and 1 alkaloid were selected to perform the quantitative analysis. The results showed that the compounds whose contents in the decoction were above 100 \u03bcg g \u22121 crude drug included orientin, 2\u2033-O-\u03b2-l-galactopyranosylorientin, puerarin, trollisin I, rosmarinic acid, 2\u2033-O-(2\u2032\u2033-methylbutanoyl) isoswertisin, daidzin, scutellarin, 3\u2032-methoxy puerarin, vitexin, 3\u2032-hydroxy puerarin, 2\u2033-O-(2\u2032\u2033-methylbutanoyl) vitexin, kaempferol, caffeic acid, 3,4-dimethoxybenzoic acid, and cynaroside in descending order. These components are mainly from Flos Trollii, Radix Puerariae Lobatae, and Folium Perillae [15] [16] [17] , and have related bioactivities such as antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects [12, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Therefore, these compounds can be considered as the major components of JD. It was found through statistical analysis that the contents of the 24 components differ greatly in JD prepared from different batches of crude drugs. This might be because the crude drugs of different batches were different in origin, growing environments, preparation process, storage, etc., which resulted in uneven drug quality. For example, based on the results of morphological and molecular identifications, some samples of Radix Puerariae Lobatae used in the experiments were from the roots of P. thomsonii rather than Pueraria lobata. Although the Chinese pharmacopoeia 2005 edition onward has excluded P. thomsonii as the original plant of Puerariae Lobatae, the crude drugs from both original plants are still used indiscriminately in the clinical practice. Thus, the content of puerarin in JD decoction prepared with the roots of Pueraria lobata was significantly higher than that prepared with the roots of P. thomsonii. Our results were also consistent with the findings reported previously [38] . Even for crude drugs of the same origin, their quality is also different due to the diversified growing environment, preparation process and storage condition. The difference of components in the crude drugs and decoctions inevitably affects the consistency of efficacy. The quality control of the chemical components is an important means to guarantee the pharmacological effects of crude drugs and the decoctions [39] . Therefore, the genuine regional crude drugs should be used as much as possible, and the preparation process and storage condition should also be strictly standardized. In addition, indirubin was detected as one of Fig. 3 The structures of 89 assigned compounds the main components of Folium Isatidis in qualitative analysis; however, it could not be quantified due to its poor ion response. In the methodological test of quantitative analysis, the precision, stability, and repeatability results for indirubin were not qualified. Consequently, the quantitative results for indirubin are for reference only, which may be related to the poor stability of this compound. It has been reported that the content of this compound decreased significantly with the increase of standing time under natural light and room temperature, and slightly reduced even under refrigeration conditions [40] .",
