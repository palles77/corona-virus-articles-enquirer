We describe here the characterization of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59) having multiple S protein-related defects. The most remarkable of these was that the mutant, designated Albany 18 (Albl8), assembled virions devoid of the S glycoprotein at the nonpermissive temperature. Albl8 also failed to bring about syncytia formation in cells infected at the nonpermissive temperature. Virions of the mutant assembled at the permissive temperature were much more thermolabile than wild type. Moreover, mutant S protein that was incorporated into virions at the permissive temperature showed enhanced pH-dependent thermolability in its ability to bind to the MHV receptor. Albl8 was found to have a single point mutation in S resulting in a change of serine 287 to isoleucin\u00a2, and it was shown by revertant analysis that this was the lesion responsible for the phenotype of the mutant.",

An understanding of the S protein must balance this sequence diversity against the necessary conservation of essential structure that allows the functions of receptor binding and membrane fusion.",

In addition, to address the possibility that loosely associated S protein on Albl8 virions produced at 39\u00b0C might have been stripped from virus particles during the multiple steps of the purification procedure, culture medium was instead collected and pelleted directly for analysis by both Western blotting and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2A , Western blotting detected equivalent amounts of 90 kDa S protein in virus released from Albl8-infected Sac-cells at 33\u00b0C and from wild type-infected cells at either 33\u00b0C or 39\u00b0C. In contrast, virus released from Albl8infected cells at 39\u00b0C contained no 90 kDa S protein, nor was there S-specific immunoreactive material of any other molecular weight. Examination of the same blot by autoradiography confirmed this result (Fig. 2B ). Because the samples in (Sturman et al., 1980) .

To examine the possibility that Albl8 contained a defect in the M protein leading to an altered ability to associate with S protein, the M gene of Albl8 was cloned and sequenced. No nucleotide difference was found between the M gene of Albl8 and that of wild-type virus in either the coding region or in the upstream intergenic region.

Coinfection of either 17Cll or Sac-cells with both Albl8 and wild-type virus, each at a multiplicity of 5 PFU/ceI1, resulted in a 20-fold reduction of infectious yield at 39\u00b0C compared with that obtained with wild-type virus alone (Table 2 , Experiment 1). The progeny of these mixed infections resembled wild-type virus in thermolability (data not shown). This suggested that at the nonpermissive temperature, Albl8 and wild-type S protein monomers were able to form mixed oligomers that were at least partially defective, and only those progeny having a sufficient concentration of wild-type homo-oligomeric S protein molecules were infectious. An alternative explanation of the data was that inhibition of wild-type infection by Albl8 was the result of a general phenomenon such as nonspecific aggregation between Albl8 S protein and other proteins in the membrane of the ER, including wild-type S protein. To examine this possibility, mixed infections were carried out at 39\u00b0C with Albl8 (or wild-type MHV) and the rhabdovirus VSV. Although VSV assembles at the plasma membrane rather than at intracellular membranes, its envelope glycoprotein follows the same secretory pathway as MHV S protein. The infectious yield of VSV in either 17Cll or Sac-cells was not reduced by coinfection with Albl8 irrespective of whether both viruses were infected simultaneously (data not shown) or even if Albl8 infection was allowed to proceed for 3 h prior to VSV infection (Table 2, Experiment 2).

Owing to the absence of spikes on Albl8 virions released from cells at the nonpermissive temperature, it was only possible to analyze Albl8 virions produced at the permissive temperature. As shown in Fig. 5 , Albl8 virions exhibited the same ability as wild-type virions to bind to receptor (compare non-heat-treated lanes for each). To determine the stability of the Albl8 spikes under conditions whose effects on wild type were already known (Sturman et al., 1990) , virus samples were treated at pH 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 or 8.0 for 24 h at 40\u00b0C. Heat-treatment at pH 6.5 slightly decreased the ability of Alb18 virions to bind to receptor. This effect increased with increasing pH, and by pH 8.0 the receptor-binding ability of Albl8 was almost completely abrogated. By contrast, wild-type virions retained the ability to bind in this assay after all pH treatments. These data show that Albl8 virion spikes could be impaired by heat and mildly alkaline conditions much more readily than those of wild-type virions, indicating that the pH-dependent confor-mational change in S protein (Sturman et al., 1990) is more pronounced or more easily triggered in the mutant S protein of Albl8.",

The most salient feature of this mutant is that at the nonpermissive temperature virions are assembled devoid of S protein. In addition, the lesion results in two other major impediments: the inability of infected cells to form syncytia at the nonpermissive temperature and the thermolability of S protein even after it has been assembled into virions at the permissive temperature.",

This supports the same conclusion reached previously from studies demonstrating that spikeless virions are released by MHV-infected ceils treated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation (Holmes et al., 1981; Rottier et al., 1981) . Similar observations have also been made with human coronavirus OC43 (Mounir and Talbot, 1992) and turkey enteric coronavirus (Dea et al., 1989) . The Albl8 phenotype recalls that of the well-studied VSV mutant tsO45, which also produces spikeless virions at its nonpermissive temperature (Gallione and Rose, 1985; Metsikkti and Simons, 1986 , and references therein). It has been shown that, in virions of tsO45 assembled at the nonpermissive temperature, the ectodomain of the VSV spike glycoprotein G has been proteolytically removed, but an anchor consisting of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions of the molecule remains embedded in the virion membrane (Metsikk6 and Simons, 1986) . We were not able to detect an analogous carboxy-terminal fragment of the Albl8 S protein in purified spikeless virion preparations tither directly or by immunoprecipitation with an anti-peptide antibody, which was raised against the carboxy terminus of S (data not shown). At present, however, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the very cysteine-rich carboxy terminus of S is refractory to immunoprecipitation or standard conditions of SDS-PAGE, as is the VSV G protein fragment (Metsikk6 and Simons, 1986) . If S protein anchors were found in Albl8 virions formed at 39\u00b0C, this would require re-evaluation of the notion that S is only a passive participant in MHV assembly.",

Serine 287 fails a little more than a third of the distance from the mature amino terminus of the S1 half of the molecule (Fig. 3) . It is highly conserved, and it lies between two cysteine residues that are absolutely conserved in all reported coronavirus S sequences. The multiple effects of the Albl8 mutation likely cannot be accounted for at the level of primary sequence. The loss of serine 287 does not eliminate or create a consensus motif for N-linked glycosylation. Moreover, there is no evidence that two other potential post-translational modifications of serine, O-glycosylation or phosphorylation, occur in the MHV S protein; and a third, acylation, has been shown to occur in the $2, but not the S1, half of the molecule . It is noteworthy that the Albl8 mutation falls within the region to which the receptor-binding ability of MHV S has been recently mapped (amino acids 1-330; Kubo et al., 1994) . Conceivably, the lesion in Albl8 S results in a temperature-and pH-dependent conformational change that affects assembly, receptor binding and fusion.",
