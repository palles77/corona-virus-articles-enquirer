These infections complicate about 5-10% of all hospitalizations and may account for as much as $2 billion per year in excess hospital costs. Therefore, nosocomial infections are a significant cause of morbidity and, in some cases, mortality in hospitalized patients. Infection control programs generally focus on bacterial nosocomial infections primarily because diagnostic bacteriologic methods are widely available. Many infection control programs have functioned well using these readily available bacteriologic data. Easy access to this data has allowed the infection control practitioner to be maximally effective by evaluating patients prospectively and hopefully, instituting measures for prevention and control of hospital infections.",

Seasonal infections are generally caused by respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, adenovirus, and some strains of parainfluenza virus. Usually, viruses are first identified in the community and then shortly afterward are seen in the hospital as nosocomial pathogens. Pediatric patients (3, 9, 11) and patients in closed or semiclosed settings such as extended care facilities (4) and psychiatric services (7) appear to be at highest risk for hospital-acquired viral infections. Infections encountered most frequently in pediatrics and longterm care settings are respiratory infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and adenovirus. Hospitalized adults in acute care settings appear to be more susceptible to reactivations of endogenous herpesvirus infections (7) .",

Other viral infections that occur throughout the year may also involve patient care personnel in their chain .of transmission to hospitalized patients. Transmission of agents such as the herpesviruses probably occurs less frequently in hospital settings but has been seen in dental settings ( An unusual isolate from infected bone uate the data. When an institution has no viral diagnostic facilities, the infection control practitioner must use less precise methods to approach viral diagnosis. Serologic methods using acute and convalescent patient sera are helpful in establishing many viral diagnoses retrospectively but generally are useless for the infection control program which functions best using data generated prospectively. The epidemiologic approach to viral diagnosis may also be used. This involves patient assessment based on viruses currently circulating in the community and evaluating patient factors such as age, clinical signs, and symptoms to arrive at this \"best guess.\" This approach is time consuming and, like serologic methods, not always precise. As rapid viral diagnostic methods improve and become more widely available, prevention and control of nosocomial viral infections will become more effective and efficient for the infection control practitioner.",

In contrast to personnel who have direct patient contact, laboratory personnel appear to be at relatively low risk of acquiring viral infections from clinical laboratory specimens because the type of contact that occurs in the laboratory is different from the contact with secretions and body fluids that occurs in the patient care setting. For example, respiratory virus transmission from laboratory specimens is probably a rare event. The greater risk of virus transmission in the laboratory is probably much the same as it is in the clinical setting, i.e., person-to-person transmission via small particle aerosol transmission or close contact transmission from infected individuals (e.g., fellow workers). An exception is laboratory transmission of hepatitis B which is related to blood contact and not to patient contact. However, the microbiology laboratory worker would probably be at relatively low risk for hepatitis B because blood contact is usually less than for other laboratory personnel such as blood bank and chemistry laboratory technologists.",

Finally, incorporating a virology laboratory as a component of the hos-pital's infection control program for patients is an exciting prospect.

In CAPD, dialysis fluid is infused into the peritoneum through a permanent peritoneal catheter. A plastic bag containing dialysate fluid is attached to the catheter and the fluid is allowed to flow in. The empty bag is then rolled up and placed in a cloth waist-purse worn under clothes. Five to 6 hr later, after diffusion, the dialysate fluid is drained back into the bag. The bag is then discarded and a new one attached. This procedure is repeated four to five times daily. Compared to conventional hemodialysis, CAPD offers the patient freedom from machines. The patient can change dialysis bags alone, at home, or at work. ,Dietary restrictions are minimal anal blood access is not a problem (13). CAPD costs about half as much per year as hemodialysis (4).Initially, peritonitis was the major problem among patients on CAPD. Replacement of glass bottles with plastic bags for the dialysate fluid container has greatly reduced the incidence of peritonitis and rates now range from one episode every 6 patient months to one episode every 17 patient months (2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 16) . Rates are lowest when patients pay close attention to sterile technique.Gram-positive cocci are isolated from dialysate fluid in 55-65% of peritonitis episodes and gram-negative bacilli in 15-25%. No organism is isolated in 4-28% (7, 10, 14, 15, 17) . The most frequent isolate is Staphylococcus epidermidis (30-40%) followed by Staphylococcus attretts (10-25%), viridans streptococci (i0-15%), and Enterobacteriaceae (10-20%). Pseudomonas spp. is isolated in 5-",
