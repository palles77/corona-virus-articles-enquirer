In vitro translation of P mRNA in a wheat germ system resulted in the synthesis of two polypeptides of Mr 35,000. Comparison of the deduced P protein sequence with that of the known mammalian pneumoviruses revealed overall amino acid identities ranging from 31 to 34.5%, suggesting a distant relationship. However, there was a much higher identity (63.2-68.4%) in a region of 57 residues, which included a heptad repeat sequence.",

The virus can also replicate in the domestic fowl and other species (for references see Cavanagh, 1992; Naylor and Jones, 1993) . The morphology of the virus particle viewed in the electron microscope, together with the number and mobility of the virus proteins and mRNA species on gels suggested that this was the only example of an avian pneumovirus (APV) described to date (Cavanagh and Barrett, 1988; Collins and Gough, 1988; Ling and Pringle, 1988) . Subsequent molecular analyses have confirmed the close genetic homology of APV with human and bovine respiratory syncytial (RS) viruses, the type member of the genus Pneumovirus of the sub-family Pneumovirinae, and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM), the only other known mammalian pneumovirus. In particular, there are extensive amino acid similarities in the predicted proteins encoded by the fusion (F) (Yu et al., 1991; Chambers et al., 1992) , the matrix (M) (Yu et al., 1992a) and the 22K (or M2) (Ling et al., 1992; Yu et al., 1992b) genes, with conserved structural features in the proteins encoded by the SH (Ling et al., 1992) and G (attachment protein) (Ling et al., 1992; Juhasz and Easton, 1994) genes. Two subgroups, A and B, of APV have been defined on the basis of extensive differences in the G protein (Juhasz and Easton, 1994) .",

            "text": "The major feature which distinguishes the pneumoviruses from other members of the family Paramyxoviridae in the electron microscope is the morphology of the helical nucleocapsid (Berthiaume et al., 1974) . The nucleocapsid complex is formed by an association of the genomic RNA, the major nucleoprotein (N), a phosphoprotein (P) and the polymerase (L) protein. The complex is responsible for the various RNA synthesis processes of virus genome replication and transcription within the infected cell, and as such has a pivotal role in virus replication. Until recently, it was thought that a major distinguishing feature between pneumoviruses and other paramyxoviruses was that the gene encoding the pneumovirus phosphoprotein was monocistronic, while the equivalent gene on other paramyxoviruses encode several protein products, either as a result of internal initiation by ribosomes both within and outside the major open reading frame (ORF), or by virtue of non-templated insertion of bases during P gene transcription making available alternative ORFs (Shioda et al., 1983; Satake et al., 1984; Bellini et al., 1985; Lambden, 1985; Galinski et al., 1986; Spriggs and Collins, 1986; Lopez et al., 1988; Johnson and Collins, 1990; Kondo et al., 1990; Matsuoka et al., 1991; Mallipedi and Samal, 1992) . Recently, analysis of the PVM P gene has shown that it contains two ORFs similar to the situation with other paramyxoviruses and that initiation at internal AUG codons directs the synthesis of several polypeptides in vivo (Barr et al., 1994) . In the light of this difference in the pattern of expression of the P gene of the two mammalian pneumoviruses it was of interest to investigate the P gene of the avian pneumovirus.",

This revealed that the sequence in the genome immediately preceding the GGGACAAGU start of gene M was (in the positive Fig. 1 ) was used to prime synthesis of cDNA on P mRNA substrate (lanes 1 and 6). The same oligonucleotide was used to prime a sequencing reaction using as substrate pBluescript containing APV insert D40, which extends beyond the beginning of the P gene (lanes 2-5). All reactions were analyzed in a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The arrows indicate the primer extension product in lanes 1 and 6 which comigrate with the first nucleotide in the sequence GGGACAAGU derived from D40, confirming that this sequence was at the beginning of the P mRNA. Yu et al., 1992a) . This closely resembles the transcription termination/polyadenylation signal sequence of the other sequenced APV genes. For example, the F and M2 genes have the sequences AGUUA UUU AAAA and AGUUA AUU AAAA at the end, followed by an intergenic region. In the case of the M-F and F-M2 junctions, the intergenic regions comprise only two nucleotides. Thus the P-M junction sequence AGUUA UG AAAAAA U most likely comprises an AGUUA UG AAAAAA transcription termination/polyadenylation signal followed by a single nucleotide, U, intergenic sequence. Analysis of clone D40 showed that immediately before the start of the P gene was the sequence AGUAA UU UUUUUU UAU, part of which is shown in Fig. 2 . The first 13 nucleotides of this sequence probably form the termination/ polyadenylation signal of the preceding gene, the UAU being a trinucleotide intergenic sequence. Northern blotting showed that in addition to the monocistronic P mRNA approximately 40% of P gene transcripts were in the form of polycistronic mRNAs (data not shown).",

            "text": "The nucleotide sequences of the two APV isolates examined in this report were identical. Both were isolated within a few months of each other at different sites in England in 1985, the first year in which APV is known to have caused disease in England. This suggests that they may be isolates of a single strain which was probably introduced into England in 1985. An unusual feature of the APV P protein is the high proportion of glutamate (E) residues in the C-terminal portion. While large numbers of charged, especially glutamate, residues are found at the C-terminus of all pneumovirus P proteins (Fig. 4) , the APV P protein contains many more, occurring consecutively or as short repetitive elements. For example, the sequence GESESEEES (residues 253-261) is immediately repeated almost exactly (Fig. 1) . This was observed with all clones of both strains. The significance of the presence of this highly negatively charged C-terminus is not clear, but the C-terminal portion of the Sendai virus P protein has been shown to be important for interacting with the major nucleocapsid protein in the nucleocapsid complex (Ryan et al., 1991) . If this is also the case for pneumoviruses, the C-terminus may interact with a basic region in the nucleoprotein.",

            "text": "A striking aspect of the aminoterminal portion of the P protein among the pneumoviruses as a group is the high concentration of proline (P) residues; there are 4-to 8-fold more prolines in the first 100 residues than in the remaining 142-190 residues. This suggests that the amino terminal region of the P protein may adopt an unusual conformation. In common with the other pneumoviruses the APV P protein is devoid of tryptophan (W) residues but whereas human and bovine RS viruses have no cysteine (C) residues in the P protein, APV and PVM have two and 5 cysteine residues, respectively. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the avian pneumovirus P protein with other paramyxovirus phosphoproteins revealed significant levels of amino acid identity only with those of other pneumoviruses. The levels of similarity observed with the mammalian pneumoviruses are shown in Table 1 . It can be seen that the overall levels of similarity are lower than any other pairwise comparison within the pneumoviruses, suggesting only a distant relationship. The immediate N-termini show a little sequence similarity, but as with PVM, APV appears to contain an insertion of sequence when compared to the RS viruses. A high degree of sequence similarity was seen only in a region spanning residues 153-209 of the APV P protein. The N-terminal portion of this region contains a heptad repeat sequence which is often involved in the formation of a-helices and coiled-coils ( Fig. 4 ) (McLachlan and Karn, 1983; Cohen and Parry, 1986) . The heptad region terminates with a helix-breaking proline residue. The high degree of conservation of such a motif may indicate that this region is involved in intra-or inter-molecular interactions. The sequence conservation continues beyond the heptad repeat region for a further 26 residues, with one region ARDG/EIRDA, highly conserved in all pneumoviruses sequenced to date. The levels of sequence identity of the various pneumoviruses compared pairwise for this conserved region are shown in Table 1 . This exceptionally high level of sequence conservation suggests that this region may play an important role in either the RNA synthesis processes carried out by the nucleocapsid complex, or in maintaining the structural integrity of the complex.",

            "text": "In vitro translation of the APV P protein resulted in the synthesis of two polypeptides of very similar M r (Fig. 3) . The larger, fainter, of the two observed polypeptides is likely to have been translated by initiation at the 5'-proximal AUG at nucleotides 14-16 while the stronger band probably reflects initiation at one or both of the next two AUG codons which are adjacent at nucleotides 44-49 (Fig. 1 ). Of these 3 AUG codons, the third (nucleotides 47-49) is in the best context for translation in vitro (Kozak, 1987) . The significance of these extra potential translational start sites in vivo is not known, but it is interesting to note that the phosphoprotein described by Cavanagh and Barrett (1988) and by Ling and Pringle (1992) did not appear as a discrete band. Whether this represents heterogeneous commencement of translation in vivo or is the result of heterogeneous post-translational modification such as phosphorlyation is unclear.",
