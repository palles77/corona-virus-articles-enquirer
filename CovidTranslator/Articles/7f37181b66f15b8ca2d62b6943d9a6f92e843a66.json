            "text": "Patrick Manson, a clinician-scientist serving in China (1866\u00b11889), discovered that many tropical infectious diseases require a vector peculiar to warm climate for person to person transmission. He demonstrated the nocturnal periodicity of microfilariae in the blood of patients with elephantiasis. These microfilariae undergo metamorphosis when ingested by the mosquito acting as the vector for the completion of their life cycle. Furthermore, he demonstrated the linkage between the lung fluke and endemic haemoptysis by finding operculated eggs in patients' sputa. He predicted that the miracidium from hatched eggs uses crustaceans, such as fresh-water snails found at tropical conditions, as the intermediate hosts in the life cycle of many trematodes. His vector hypothesis leads to vector control which is now the cornerstone for the World Health Organization's programme for the elimination/control of lymphatic filariasis, dracunculiasis and malaria. Before leaving China, he established the Alice Memorial Hospital, the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese (the forerunner of the University of Hong Kong), and the Hong Kong Medical Society for medical service and education. He also incepted the Hong Kong Dairy Farm for supplying hygienic milk affordable by pregnant women, children and patients.",

His mother, Elizabeth Livingstone, was a distant relative of the great explorer and Christian missionary of Africa, Mr David Livingstone. Manson, as he used to mock himself as`Scandinavian pirate' owing to his Norwegian descent, was described as a dull but curious child. Among his Presbyterian Christian family, he was noticed to have a good memory for being able to memorize the church sermons at the age of 5 years. As he grew up, he was noted for his interest in carpentry, mechanics, cricket and hunting with shotguns. A minor incident foretelling his career was his shooting and dissection of a lean and ferocious cat which yielded a tapeworm inside. However, his initial enthusiasm for mechanics led to his apprenticeship as an ironsmith at the age of 15 years. His will power was obviously much stronger than his physique; he soon developed a spinal curvature and right arm paresis after working for the same hours as other adult ironsmiths. Being medically certified as invalid, he had to give up engineering which turned out to be a blessing in disguise when he switched to biological science. His personal experience of illness and disability might have contributed to his decision to go into medicine, a caring profession.",

            "text": "In 1860, Manson started studying medicine at the University of Aberdeen for 4 years. As he finished his medical curriculum at the age of 20 years which was too young for graduation, he had to spend another year in reading and visiting hospitals, schools and museums before he formally graduated in 1865. He then worked for 7 months as an assistant medical officer at a lunatic asylum in Durham during which time he performed 17 postmortem dissections on patients with psychiatric illnesses for his Doctor of Medicine thesis. He reasoned in his thesis that the severity of the brain pathology in these patients correlates with the diameter of their aneurismal internal carotid artery, which is similar to the situation of a cirrhotic liver and the dilated portal vein due to portal hypertension. 1  FROM AN INEXPERIENCED MEDICAL GRADUATE TO A  MEDICAL OFFICER WORKING ALONE IN TAKAO OF FORMOSA  (NOWADAYS TAIWAN) In 1866, Manson was inspired by his elder brother who worked in Shanghai to take up a medical officer post in the Customs Service of Formosa. He sailed for 3 months from London across the Cape of Good Hope, Madagascar, and finally arrived at Takao (present day Kaohsiung) of Formosa. His official daily duty was to inspect the ships calling at the port, treat their crew and keep the meteorological record. He also attended to Chinese patients in a local missionary hospital where he was exposed to a wide variety of illnesses from elephantiasis to leprosy for his postgraduate training without any supervision. His only research tool was a combination of clinical skill, hand lens and good record keeping. He took pride in fishing out leeches from the nose of patients painlessly by soaking and relaxing the leeches with hypertonic saline. He successfully treated European patients who developed tropical liver after too much meat and wine (probably fatty liver) with a prescription of heavy exercise and dietary discretion. However, he was quite disappointed by the death of a young Chinese patient presenting with heart failure who died the next day following his treatment. The patient was not improving after weeks of treatment by a traditional Chinese doctor. Later he realized that this and many similar patients were suffering from beriberi as a result of vitamin B1 deficiency only after many years. 2 While he became more and more confident with his successes, he also became humbler and wiser with each of his failures.",

The inhabitants were in extreme poverty who subsisted on rice and sweet potatoes occasionally flavoured with vegetable pickles and salted fish.

In 1877, he excised one ton of tissue from patients with elephantiasis, with only 2 deaths out of 61 operations done under chloroform anaesthesia and without support by blood transfusions and antibiotics. Many of these patients could not find a job because of their grotesquely disfigured and enlarged lower limbs and scrotums. They were abandoned by their families because of the financial burden or the superstition about demon possession. In one instance, he encountered a 19-year-old man badly affected by a huge elephantoid tumour who attempted suicide by swallowing arsenic but failed because the excessive dose of poison caused gastric irritation leading to early emesis of the poison. He agreed to be operated by Manson because he did not mind to be killed anyway. This successful operation by Manson earned him reputation and the gradual acceptance of Western medicine by the local Chinese. Besides elephantiasis, he has relieved many patients suffering from the distressing colics due to renal, ureteric and bladder stones by surgical lithotomies. Despite these achievements, he was modest in describing himself as a good carpenter but an indifferent surgeon.",

Despite his daring personality and meticulous surgical skills, he was a conscientious surgeon who did not touch the eye till he had acquired such specialist skill in London. While searching for the most updated information on tropical diseases and entomology, he was quite disappointed to find that such information was scarce and poorly organized. However, he bumped onto the work of Timothy Lewis in the British Museum Library on the finding of a microscopic nematode worm, Filaria sanguinis hominis (Filaria nocturna, Wuchereris bancrofti), in the chylous urine and blood of an Indian patient suffering from chyluria. 5 This struck Manson as he had operated on many cases of elephantiasis who also had chyluria.

He traced the changes of microfilariae in the alimentary tract of female Culex fatigans (Culex quinquefasciatus) mosquitoes fed with infected human blood. 6 After dissecting hundreds of such mosquitoes, Manson found that the microfilariae underwent unsheathing and metamorphosis from the alimentary tract to the thoracic muscles of mosquitoes. In 1899, Thomas Bancroft demonstrated that these infected mosquitoes can inoculate the parasite back to human by biting. 7 Finally, Manson and others successfully discovered the adult worms of W. bancrofti with all stages of microfilariae in their uterus within the lymphatics of patients suffering from elephantiasis. Thus, the complete life cycle of filariasis in humans and mosquitoes was described, which clearly illustrates how human-tohuman transmission occurs through the mosquito vector.",

A light was placed inside this house and the door was opened for 30 min at night. Next morning, mosquitoes with their abdomens engorged with infected human blood were found on the gauze. They were stupefied by tobacco smoke and transferred to labelled glass vials. Then they were dissected and examined under the microscope. 5 Of the 190 Chinese people that Manson examined, 15 who had microfilariae in their blood samples had some sign of elephantiasis or some indication of ill\u00b1health as shown by recurrent fever and oedema. After examining 670 persons, he found that 1 in every 10.8 patients in Amoy was infected and the incidence of infection increased from 1 in 17.5 during youth to 1 in 3 for the elderly.

Soon after the inauguration of the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, he was summoned by Mr Hung-Chang Li, the prime minister of the Ching Dynasty of China who was suspected to have a tongue cancer, to Tientsin in November 1887. Manson was prostrated by a prolonged bout of gout and had to be carried on board by others. Manson found that Mr Li had a sublingual abscess which was incised and drained. Mr Li was deeply impressed by the knowledge and skill of Manson. Later, Mr Li became the patron of the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese from 1889 till his death in 1901. The college was subsequently incorporated into the HKU which was established in 1911.",

            "text": "With the firm foundation laid down by Manson, the following decades saw a slow but sustained development of research in infectious diseases at the HKU. In 1920, HKU established the chair of pathology for Dr Chung-Yik Wang who published extensively on infectious diseases including tuberculosis and syphilis. 14, 15 The first post-second world war chair Professor in pathology (1948) was Dr Pao-Chang Hou who described the relationship between primary cholangiocarcinoma of the liver and Clonorchis sinensis infection. 16 In the inaugural speech of the chair Professor of pathology in 1968, Dr James Gibson emphasized that the fatality of infectious disease is higher than the fatalities due to injuries in wars. He proposed the establishment of the Department of Microbiology which is dedicated to the teaching and research of microbiology. In 1976, Dr Chi-To Huang became the founding chair of microbiology who firstly discovered that Pseudomonas pseudomallei (now renamed Burkholderia pseudomallei) was the cause of a major outbreak amongst the dolphins of Ocean Park in Hong Kong. 17 With the successful control of most tropical diseases in Hong Kong, the direction of infectious disease research has switched to emerging infectious diseases since the 1990s. Among the top three emerging pathogens of global significance, human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A H5N1 virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, the latter two have emerged in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2003, respectively. 18, 19 HKU has characterized these two viruses and their associated diseases which directly impacted on patient care and public health policy. The source of this newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was successfully traced from human to civets and then the natural reservoir in Chinese horseshoe bats. 20 Similar to the key role of arthropods and animal vectors in the transmission of tropical diseases, wild animals have played a major role in the genesis of emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, HKU has continued to search and has subsequently discovered over 40 novel viruses in animals and human. 20\u00b125 Besides serving the citizens of Hong Kong, the medical school has also tried to improve the medical system and education in the Mainland through its participation in setting up the HKU-Shenzhen hospital as a teaching hospital in the Guangdong province in 2012.",

The annual death rate in the British garrison varied between 3% and 13.6%, and many deaths were related to infection ( Figure 5 ). Besides advocating sanitation and public health prevention to improve the dire situation, Manson and others established the Dairy Farm at the Pokfulam district in 1886 for providing a hygienic and affordable supply of milk and dairy products for pregnant women, children and patients. The farmers and the first batch of Ayrshire cows were sent from Aberdeenshire of Scotland, and the pasture of guineagrass grown on the bare hill side of the farm was imported from Queensland. The improvement of nutritional status is vital to our health, including reduced susceptibility to infection. 26 29 This led to strong repercussions from his colleagues and he had to leave Dreadnought. Though he had to pay the price of honesty and conviction by resignation, he was then given a teaching post for tropical diseases at the Albert Dock Seaman Hospital in 1901. But with time, people were more and more convinced of the necessity of tropical medicine, Manson founded the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1899. At the age of 55 years, Manson had to spend 3 h per round trip and travelled 9 miles to the school two to three times per week for his teaching duties. Similar to most eminent scientists, he was always concerned with how to induce continuous interest in future generations to make keen observations in patients and pursue effective control of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "The groundwork of Manson has laid a solid foundation for many clinical practices and epidemiological programmes in modern tropical medicine. Global programmes in vector control remain the mainstay in the control and eradication of malaria, filariasis and dracunculiasis; 30\u00b132 22.8% of emerging infectious diseases since 1940 are vectorborne diseases. 33 Control of arthropod vector-borne diseases includes chemical and biological means, as well as by reducing contact between human and vectors. The best example is the control of mosquitoes, which includes the reduction of the mosquito population by Patrick Manson and tropical diseases KKW To and KY Yuen 5 environmental modifications, larvicides and adulticides, and the prevention of mosquito\u00b1human contact with medicated bed-nets and insect repellants. Alternative biological control strategies under investigation to reduce insecticide resistance and ecological side effects include the use of a bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia to inhibit the replication of the Plasmodium in mosquitoes, entomopathogenic fungi and genetically-modified mosquitoes. 34\u00b136 Our understanding of the life cycle of flukes provides the basis for control programmes of schistosomiasis in China, which mainly aims to minimize contacts of snails from excreta of humans or cattle. 37 Though the incidence of paragonimiasis has been reduced substantially with education programmes and mass chemotherapy, 38 it is the control of the vector population and reduction in human\u00b1arthropod contacts that are most practicable and sustainable. The importance of vector-borne diseases extends beyond parasites. Mosquitoes transmit many viruses that cause epidemics, such as yellow fever, dengue and chikungunya virus. The problem of vector-borne disease is further aggravated by climate change. The geographical range of arthropod-borne infections has expanded in recent years in both latitude and altitude. 39 For example, chikungunya virus, which was previously limited to tropical countries, has now been found in Italy. 40 Many newly described emerging infections also require a vector, for example the new phleboviruses 41\u00b142 and Ehrlichia. 43 A GREAT PERSONAL EXAMPLE OF A CLINICIAN, SCIENTIST AND TEACHER Manson died in 1922. He was a great physician, surgeon, microbiologist and a discoverer without mentors. His long period of stay in the tropics posed significant risk to his health and safety. He has set the personal example of excellence in clinical service, medical education and microbial research. His scientific contributions on the importance of vector control to interrupt the life cycle of many tropical disease agents make him well deserved of the title of Father of Tropical Medicine. In the year 2000, the World Health Organization launched a global campaign for eliminating lymphatic filariasis which would not have been possible without the firm foundation laid down by Manson. 31 His contribution to China did not end after leaving China. In 1896, he helped Dr James Cantlie in saving Dr Yat-Sen Sun from the kidnap and imprisonment by secret agents of the Ching Dynasty in London. If not for their effort, Dr Sun might have been executed, and China may not have been liberated from the feudal Ching Dynasty in 1911. In the pursuit of science and medicine, Manson emphasized that most mistakes do not come from not knowing in medicine, but from not looking. It is not the microscope, but the eyes that look through it that counts. Additionally, never refuse to see what you do not want to see, for it is often the finger pointing towards discovery.",

He obtained his membership of Royal College of Physicians by examination in 1889 and became the physician to the Seamen's hospital at Dreadnought for 6 years. He was a strong advocate on the necessity for special education in tropical medicine. In an introductory address delivered at the St George Hospital of London, he said,`the course of instruction in general medicine usually received in this country is utterly inadequate to qualify for tropical practice. I say so emphatically, basing my assertion on my own experience, my own mistakes, and what I have seen and still daily see of the mistakes of others'.",

This hospital served Chinese patients and was also the teaching hospital for the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese which is the forerunner of the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He was the founding dean who gave his inaugural speech on 1 October 1887 at the City Hall, during which Manson emphasized the role of the college in medical education to fight ignorance, superstition and outdated traditions of the feudal Ching Dynasty, the popularization of Western medical practice to ease suffering and its future contributions of research to advance scientific truth for the Chinese and the world. Hong Kong, Manson also founded the Hong Kong Medical Society in 1886 which later had its regular meetings conducted in Alice",
