Bone marrow collection can be used to stage neoplasia or determine the etiology of hypercalcemia or hypergammaglobulinemia that may be caused by lymphosarcoma or multiple myeloma. Although most healthy cats do not have visible iron stores in the bone marrow, the presence of iron here will eliminate iron deficiency as a cause of anemia. 34 Additional indications for collecting bone marrow include the inappropriate presence of immature hematopoietic cells in the circulation, unexplained leukocytosis or thrombocytosis, and dysplastic changes in the circulating blood cells. Routine evaluation of the bone marrow is not helpful in sorting out the causes of absolute erythrocytosis (polycythemia) because the erythroid morphology of the marrow appears the same in all cases (erythroid hyperplasia). 47 ",

The needle is inserted in a craniomedial direction perpendicular to the long axis of the bone. 19:673, 1989.) Once the needle is seated firmly in the bone, or if it is still in place after aspiration, it is advanced another 1 to 1.5 cm, with the stylet removed, using the same rotational pressure as before. This maneuver should cut a core out of the marrow. At this point the needle need no longer be advanced. The core is broken off by several clockwise revolutions of the needle followed by several counterclockwise twists. The needle is withdrawn a short distance and advanced slightly again, this time at an angle slightly off axis. It should be twisted in both directions several times so that the bevel of the needle cuts the core off at the endosteum. The needle is removed by again rotating in both directions. The core sample should be gently pushed out of the top of the needle using the stylet. Bone marrow biopsy needles are tapered at the beveled end, and forcing the core sample through the tip will damage the sample. Once removed, the core can be rolled on a glass microscope slide for cytology if an aspirate has not been obtained.

Decreased numbers of red blood cells results in decreased tissue oxygenation; they mature so quickly to punctate reticulocytes, the presence of increased numbers of circulating aggregate reticulocytes suggests ongoing hypoxia. An important concept regarding feline anemia is that an increase in the numbers of aggregate reticulocytes (above the reference range for the laboratory) is required before a moderate to severe anemia is considered regenerative. Unless the anemia is mild, and the more immature aggregate reticulocytes are not required, the presence of punctate reticulocytes alone is not evidence of regeneration. In cats the absolute number of aggregate reticulocytes is a more reliable indicator of regeneration than the corrected reticulocyte percentage or the reticulocyte production index. 54 EPO also stimulates hemoglobin synthesis. Feline hemoglobin is unique in that it has less affinity for oxygen than the hemoglobin found in other species; consequently, oxygen is more easily released to the tissues. This may be one explanation for why the packed cell volume (PCV) and hemoglobin concentration in the normal cat are lower than those of normal dogs. 54 In a healthy cat the production and removal of erythrocytes is balanced. The life span of the normal, mature feline erythrocyte is approximately 73 days, after which they are removed from circulation by macrophages in the spleen, and the heme and iron recycled.",

If the card-typing system is used, type AB and type B results should be confirmed by a referral laboratory because some cross-reactions have been known to occur. 104 A recently introduced option for patient-side blood typing is the gel column agglutination test (DiaMed-Vet feline typing gel, DiaMed, Switzerland). This test is easier to interpret than the card method, although it requires a specially designed centrifuge that may be cost prohibitive in some settings. 118 An evaluation of various blood typing methods for the cat concluded that the gel column test is reliable compared with the gold standard, the Penn tube assay. 104 Genetic blood typing using buccal mucosal swabs is available from certain labs and may allow breeders to identify heterozygous type A cats (A/b).

No alloantibodies are produced against antigens that are similar to self-antigens, and no previous exposure to blood products (transfusions) is necessary to produce the alloantibodies. Knowledge of this system is important in the prevention of transfusion reactions and neonatal isoerythrolysis. Cats with type B blood have anti-A antibodies with strong hemolytic potential. Even a small volume of type A or AB blood administered to a type B cat can cause potentially life-threatening hemolysis within minutes of the transfusion. 36 Hemolysis of type B blood administered to a type A cat will result in a reduced life span of the transfused erythrocytes, but severe reactions are uncommon. 42 Ingestion of colostrum from a type B queen by a type A newborn results in absorption of anti-A alloantibodies and subsequent rapid hemolysis of the kitten's erythrocytes.

The blood type of a neonate's parents may be critical information if an ill day-old kitten exhibits signs of neonatal isoerythrolysis. Other signs, such as polyuria and polydipsia, can indicate the presence of chronic diseases. Gastrointestinal signs may lead to the consideration of chronic blood loss or inflammatory disease. Recent surgery or trauma may result in blood loss anemia. Mucous membrane pallor is a common physical finding. If hemolysis is present, the mucous membrane color may be icteric. Decreased peripheral perfusion from causes such as shock or congestive heart failure may also cause pallor, whereas hepatic failure can result in icterus. Evidence of volume contraction, such as tacky mucous membranes or prolonged skin tenting, may be present. Remember that older cats lack skin elasticity and may have a prolonged skin tent even if well hydrated. A moderate decrease in erythrocyte numbers leads to decreased blood viscosity and tissue hypoxia. A soft murmur may be present because turbulent blood flow is directly related to decreased blood viscosity. Hypoxia leads to vasodilation, resulting in an increased heart rate in an attempt to increase cardiac output and oxygen delivery to the tissues. Tachypnea is also a common finding. Fleas or ticks may be found during a detailed examination of the skin, particularly in young animals. Fever may be present in cats with infectious causes of anemia, and splenomegaly is a common finding in cats with hemolysis of any etiology. Small kidneys may be appreciated in a cat with chronic renal disease. Any abdominal mass should be noted for further evaluation. Petechial or ecchymotic hemorrhages indicate bleeding from hemostatic disorders, whereas bleeding wounds may be evidence of recent trauma. Discolored urine may stain the perineum of a longhaired white cat. The severity of the clinical signs shown by anemic cats is more often related to the chronicity than degree of anemia.

The single, best indicator of regeneration is an increase in the absolute aggregate reticulocyte count. 126 The severity of anemia should not be assessed until any volume deficits have been corrected. A CBC with a platelet and aggregate reticulocyte count and a blood smear examination will provide evidence of regeneration as long as sufficient time has elapsed since the initial insult.

If the anemia is nonregenerative, evaluation of the bone marrow may be required to make an etiologic diagnosis. An attempt should be made to biopsy any masses identified during the evaluation. Examination and sampling of the gastrointestinal mucosa may be required to diagnose causes of blood loss from this system.

Correction of volume contraction may improve the patient's attitude and appetite. Intravenous fluids may be necessary if volume depletion is significant. Concerns regarding reduction of oxygencarrying capacity by reducing the PCV with fluid therapy are probably unfounded. The total body hemoglobin and oxygen-carrying ability remains unchanged. However, cats with low plasma protein levels are at risk of edema formation as a result of dilution by aggressive fluid administration. Cats with severe signs related to the anemia, such as respiratory distress or extreme weakness, may require a transfusion. Oxygen administration adds little to the ability to improve tissue hypoxia in anemic patients. 35 The low solubility of oxygen in plasma results in a very small increase in the dissolved oxygen content when 100% oxygen is inhaled.

The half-life of appropriately matched red blood cells in the cat is 29 to 39 days, but for mismatched transfusions the half-life may be a matter of hours.

All cats suspected of being anemic on the basis of the history and clinical signs should have blood drawn for a CBC to include erythrocyte indices, a reticulocyte count, and a blood smear evaluation. The presence of pinpoint hemorrhages (petechiae) should prompt a platelet count. A CBC from a cat with a regenerative anemia should reveal evidence of a reduced erythrocyte mass such as a decreased PCV, red blood cell count, and hemoglobin concentration. The presence of reticulocytes, which are larger and have less hemoglobin than mature erythrocytes, should result in an increased MCV and decreased MCHC. This is why regenerative anemias are classified as macrocytic (increased MCV) and hypochromic (decreased MCHC). Examining a properly made blood smear is very important. The blood smear evaluation may reveal populations of cells of different sizes (anisocytosis) and colors (polychromasia). Morphologic changes may also be present that may give clues as to the cause of the anemia. Blood parasites and Heinz bodies may be seen on a blood smear. Because of the small size of feline erythrocytes, recognizing spherocytes in this species is difficult and is best left to an experienced veterinary cytopathologist. Microscopic agglutination and rouleaux formation can be appreciated when looking at a blood smear. The presence of a population of immature erythrocytes will increase the RDW, and a histogram of cell size versus numbers may contain two peaks representing two populations of cells-mature and immature. If the anemia has not been present long enough, few reticulocytes will be in the circulation and the red cell indices are likely to be within and pleural effusion. In one study of cats receiving Oxyglobin, 20% of cats developing respiratory signs required furosemide or supplemental oxygen during or after treatment. Most of these cats had preexisting heart disease. 32 The lower dose should be used cautiously in cats with cardiac disease. The oxygen-carrying effects of Oxyglobin last up to 3 days in circulation. 42 Adverse effects of blood transfusions can be immunologic reactions to incompatible blood or nonimmune events and may occur within 1 or 2 hours after the transfusion begins. Occasionally, they may be seen up to 48 hours later. 42 In a study of 126 cats that received blood transfusions, 11 cats (8.7%) suffered acute reactions. 53 Multiple red blood cell transfusions (either whole blood or packed red blood cells) are also well tolerated in cats and may be critical for survival of some severely ill patients. 98 Immune-mediated reactions can include hemolysis, allergic reactions, fever, or graft-versus-host reactions. Bacterial contamination of the blood product, hemolysis, hypocalcemia (from citrate toxicity), hypothermia, hyperammonemia, and volume overload are examples of nonimmune adverse reactions. In either case, the life span of the transfused erythrocytes may be shortened. Some reactions are severe enough to cause death. Despite the best efforts to prevent them, transfusion reactions may still occur. Depending on the severity, therapy may include glucocorticoids, epinephrine, crystalloid intravenous fluids, and discontinuation of the transfusion. Fever is usually mild, requiring no treatment. Furosemide should be administered if volume overload occurs. To prevent hypothermia, the blood product can be warmed to no more than 37\u00b0 C. If the reaction is relatively mild, the transfusion can be restarted at a slower rate. Cross-matching blood is the best means of preventing immune-mediated transfusion reactions even if the blood type is known for both cats. It is also imperative that blood be collected and administered as aseptically as possible and that cats receiving blood products be carefully monitored.",

Antibodies may be formed against erythrocyte antigens (type II hypersensitivity), against a non-erythrocyte antigen attached to the red cell surface (type III hypersensitivity), or an antibody may be produced against an unassociated antigen that is similar to an erythrocyte antigen. Alloantibodies present in transfused blood or in colostrum from a type B queen ingested by a type A kitten may lead to immune-mediated hemolysis. Some erythrocyte antigens are hidden and exposed to the immune system only after the cell membrane has been damaged. New antigens that cross-react with red cell antigens or attach to the red cell membrane may be released into circulation by infection or inflammation. 34 The antibodies involved in the immune process are usually IgG, although IgM can be present alone or with IgG. Macrophages of the mononuclear phagocyte system have receptors for the Fc portion of the IgG antibody but not for IgM. Fc receptors are proteins on the surfaces of cells such as macrophages and neutrophils that contribute to the protective functions of the immune system. Fc receptors bind to the Fc portion of antibodies attached to pathogens or infected cells and stimulate the activity of phagocytic or cytotoxic cells. The antibody-coated cells are removed after antibody binds to the receptor on the macrophage, mostly in the red the reference range for the laboratory. It may be necessary to repeat a CBC at a later date to reveal regeneration.",

Endoscopic examination may be required to identify causes of gastrointestinal blood loss. Radiography of the thorax and an abdominal ultrasound examination should be performed to look for the presence of an effusion or mass. Congenital or acquired coagulopathy or trauma may result in a hemorrhagic effusion. A mass lesion may indicate the presence of neoplasia that could result in a secondary immunemediated event. An abdominal radiograph may reveal the presence of a metallic foreign body in the gastrointestinal tract. Such a foreign body may be a zinccontaining coin, suggesting a possible nonimmune cause for the hemolytic anemia. A slide agglutination test should be performed on a washed or saline diluted EDTA blood sample. If there is no obvious agglutination on gross examination of the slide, a microscopic exam should be performed. Because both test for the presence of antibodies coating the erythrocyte, a direct Coombs' test is unnecessary if the slide agglutination test is positive. If the slide agglutination test is negative, a direct Coombs' test should be performed. Occasionally, FeLV will cause immune-mediated hemolysis.

During and immediately after significant blood loss, the PCV may remain normal, insofar as there is loss of both erythrocytes and plasma. A shift of fluid from the interstitial to intravascular space occurs within 12 to 24 hours, diluting the erythrocytes. 129 The result is a decrease in the PCV and total protein concentration. These decreases occur earlier if intravenous fluids have been administered. Erythrocyte morphology at this point will be normal, as will the MCV and MCHC. For 3 to 5 days, the anemia will appear nonregenerative and the diagnosis of a blood loss anemia is made on the basis of suspicion, history, physical findings, and a decreased total protein concentration. Once sufficient time has elapsed, reticulocytes appear and the anemia becomes regenerative. If the bleeding is controlled, the transient increase in aggregate reticulocyte numbers is followed by a rise in the number of punctate reticulocytes as after an extensive workup.

Increased numbers of aggregate reticulocytes should be present. Polychromasia and rubricytosis (nucleated red blood cells) may be present. The hallmark of IMHA in dogs, spherocytosis, is unlikely to be identified. The PCV may be surprisingly low for the condition of the patient; cats seem to tolerate a lower PCV than dogs. 57 The lower the PCV, the higher the aggregate reticulocyte count should be. If the reticulocyte count is not appropriate for the degree of anemia, it may be nonregenerative. In this case an immune response directed at erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow might be considered. Another difference from dogs is the lack of leukocytosis or neutrophilia with left shift in cats with primary IMHA. In the aforementioned study by Kohn and coworkers 57 17 of the 19 cats with primary IMHA had a white cell count within the reference range. The platelet count should be within the reference range, too. Evans syndrome, a combination of immune-mediated damage to both erythrocytes and platelets, is rare in cats. Although evidence of DIC is common in dogs with IMHA, it is uncommon in cats. Before convicting a cat with anemia of also having thrombocytopenia on the basis of an automated cell count, a blood smear should be examined to determine whether platelet clumping is present.

Volume contraction may be reflected by azotemia, which is likely prerenal in cats with primary IMHA. Other changes may be present if there is an underlying disease (secondary IMHA). Any thoracic or abdominal masses should be biopsied. An airway wash with pulp of the spleen. The result is extravascular hemolysis. Complete phagocytosis may not occur, and only a portion of the membrane may be removed. The cell's volume-to-surface-area ratio is reduced, and the cell becomes spherical. Spherocytes are less able to deform, making passage through the spleen more difficult. Because of the nonsinusoidal nature of the feline spleen (see the section on splenic diseases later in this chapter), less cell deformability is required for cells to pass through, and decreased numbers of spherocytes are trapped and destroyed than in dogs. Splenic macrophages also have receptors for complement. If a sufficient quantity of IgG antibodies coat the cell membrane, complement may also bind to the erythrocyte. The presence of complement on the cell membrane increases the efficiency of erythrocyte removal. If a sufficient number of the antibodies are IgM, complement-mediated lysis can occur, resulting in intravascular hemolysis. However, none of the 19 cats with primary IMHA in one study had intravascular hemolysis despite the presence of IgM in 8 of the cats. 57 Cats with IMHA, whether primary or secondary, will exhibit signs related to the anemia. These can include anorexia, lethargy, weakness, or respiratory difficulties. Additional signs as a result of the underlying disease may be present in cats with secondary IMHA. Most of the cats with primary IMHA are young adults. In the previously mentioned report of 19 cats with primary disease, six were younger than 2 years old; the median age for all 19 cats was 2 years. 57 Eleven of the cats were male, and eight female. Cats with secondary disease will have a signalment related to the underlying disease. Physical changes that might be present include pale or icteric mucous membranes, tachycardia, tachypnea, or splenomegaly as a consequence of increased processing of damaged erythrocytes. Tachypnea and tachycardia are attempts at compensating for the decreased oxygencarrying capacity of the anemic patient; pulmonary thromboembolism, so common in dogs with IMHA, is rare in cats. 57 Splenomegaly occurs in many nonimmune disorders causing hemolysis as the organ attempts to deal with the increased numbers of damaged red cells. Body temperature is likely to be normal unless the patient is moribund, in which case hypothermia may be noted. A systolic murmur may be heard during auscultation of the thorax.",

Concerns regarding exacerbating hypoxia by decreasing the PCV with intravenous fluids are unwarranted. Although the PCV may decrease, the total amount of hemoglobin in the body does not. However, rehydration will reveal the true severity of the anemia. Depending on the cat's condition and PCV, a blood transfusion may be required. A major cross-match before collecting and administering blood is imperative, even if the blood type of the donor and recipient is known.

Cyclosporine has little effect on nonstimulated T cells, is not cytotoxic or myelosuppressive, 58 and spares other rapidly dividing cells. 40 Common adverse effects include anorexia and vomiting, which respond to a decrease in the dose. It has a bitter taste that may cause refusal to eat if mixed with food. 87 Hepatotoxicity is not a problem except at extremely high blood levels, 40 but reversible nephrotoxicity, although not as common as in people, can occur in cats at any blood level. 40 Monitoring of renal function in cats receiving cyclosporine is warranted. The gingival lesions seen in dogs receiving cyclosporine have not been reported in cats. 119 Patients receiving cyclosporine may also have an increased risk of developing neoplasia, particularly lymphosarcoma. 40 This effect may be due to decreased surveillance for neoplastic cells by the cellular arm of the immune system. Only the modified formulations of cyclosporine are recommended. A veterinary preparation of the emulsified form, Atopica (Novartis Animal Health), is available in capsules, allowing more accurate dosing in cats. This formulation is administered orally at 1 to 5 mg/kg of ideal body weight every 12 to 24 hours, and routine drug monitoring is generally unnecessary 87 unless the patient is not responding as expected. Measuring 2-hour postadministration cyclosporine concentrations is more splenic macrophages. In addition, they may decrease antibody binding to the red cell membrane and complement activation. 34 There are few direct effects on B-lymphocytes, and therefore there is little effect on antibody production. 27, 90 Cats have fewer and less sensitive cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors than dogs. 16 This may explain why cats typically have less pronounced side effects; for instance, polyuria and polydipsia and steroid hepatopathy are not typical side effects of glucocorticoid use in cats. 27 Cats receiving immunosuppressive doses of glucocorticoids may have difficulty eliminating infections on their own, and some infections may be inapparent because the inflammation associated with the infection may be blunted by the antiinflammatory effect of the glucocorticoid.",

The biological duration of action of these drugs is 24 to 36 hours, which is longer than the plasma half-life. Therefore there is little advantage in dividing the daily dose in two other than to reduce the gastric irritation some patients experience at very high doses. 16 If oral medication is contraindicated because of vomiting or severe oral cavity or esophageal disease, injectable dexamethasone may be substituted at 0.25 to 1 mg/kg every 24 hours subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Repository glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol, Pfizer) prevent accurate titrating of the dose, and their use is not recommended. 16 Response is indicated by a stable or rising PCV and can be expected within a week. Appropriately treated secondary IMHA may respond more quickly. The Coombs' test will remain positive, possibly for months, despite a normal PCV. Once the PCV has reached and remains in the low part of the reference range for at least 1 week, consideration may be given to slowly decreasing the glucocorticoid dose. A rapid response may allow for a more rapid reduction in dose. The dose may be reduced by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 weeks. Once the dose of prednisolone has reached 0.5 mg/kg, alternate-day therapy may begin. It is imperative to ensure the maintenance of remission before each dose reduction. There is no sense in reducing the dose in a cat that is deteriorating. Once a physiologic dose (0.25 mg/kg) of prednisolone has been reached, an attempt can be made to discontinue the drug. Whether this is possible depends on the individual cat. Relapses are to be expected and should be treated by increasing to the last effective dose.",

Although not as potent as cyclophosphamide, it is well tolerated by cats and is the preferred first choice when an additional drug is required. Dosages range from 2 mg/cat orally sodium/potassium (Na/K) ATPase is lost during maturation, and, subsequently, the cytoplasmic sodium and potassium concentrations are similar to plasma. Because erythrocytes lack mitochondria, energy generation is exclusively anaerobic. Pyruvate kinase (PK) is involved in the last step in energy production and catalyzes the production of pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate, yielding a high-energy ATP molecule. 55 Some of this energy is responsible for maintaining the pliability of the cell membrane, which allows the cell to squeeze through small capillaries. Two inherited defects in the feline erythrocyte occur in the related Abyssinian and Somali breeds of cat. Both defects affect erythrocyte survival time. One involves a PK deficiency; the other an idiopathic increase in red cell osmotic fragility. Both are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and are identified in young cats with Coombs'-negative hemolytic anemia. Other, more common causes of hemolysis must be eliminated as possible causes of anemia before considering inherited defects. This requires an exhaustive effort to find other causes of regenerative anemia. A CBC, including an aggregate reticulocyte count and measurement of red cell indices, serum biochemical profile, and a urinalysis, should be performed. The patient should be screened for retroviral and hemoplasma infection and have a direct Coombs' test run.",

These cats exhibit the common signs associated with anemia, including lethargy, weakness, pale mucous membranes, and anorexia. The signs are often intermittent and mild, even in cats with severe anemia. Physical findings are not specific for PK deficiency and may include pallor, lethargy, icterus, or weight loss. Mild to moderate splenomegaly is common. At presentation, most, but not all, cats are anemic, with a PCV between 13% and 29% (median of 25%) reported in one study. 55 The anemia in most is regenerative with macrocytosis, polychromasia, and an aggregate reticulocytosis. Some cats have a lymphocytosis and a polyclonal hyperglobulinemia, possibly as a result of nonspecific immune system stimulation. A genetic test is available for PK deficiency and might be useful in all breeding Abyssinian and Somali cats, particularly those related to cats with anemia. Affected cats are homozygous for the causative mutation and have very low PK activity. 33 Heterozygotes have intermediate PK activity and, because they are asymptomatic carriers, can transmit the defect unknowingly. Therapy is limited for cats with PK deficiency. They are often misdiagnosed with IMHA or hemoplasmosis and receive prednisolone, doxycycline, or both. Prednisolone may be beneficial in reducing the number of hemolytic crises by delaying phagocytosis by macrophages in the spleen. Splenectomy should be considered when recurrent hemolytic episodes occur or if closely correlated with the drug's area under the curve than trough blood levels and more accurately predicts clinical response. 87 Because cyclosporine is extensively bound to erythrocytes, whole blood levels are higher than plasma concentrations. 58 Leflunomide (Arava, Sanofi Aventis) is a prodrug that is metabolized into the active form by the intestinal mucosa. 40 The active form inhibits a lymphocyte growth factor receptor 40 and mitochondrial enzymes, leading to inhibition of T cell proliferation. 40, 92 It is particularly effective in inhibiting B cell proliferation and antibody production. The drug is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine. 92 The gastrointestinal problems experienced by dogs do not seem to occur in cats, 40 insofar as the metabolite causing the gastrointestinal distress is less toxic to cats. 130 Cats with inadequate renal function may, however, accumulate enough of the metabolite to cause gastrointestinal upset. 130 Leflunomide is administered orally at 2 to 4 mg/kg every 24 hours. Once remission is achieved, the dose can be reduced to once or twice weekly to maintain adequate blood levels. 40 Leflunomide orally at 10 mg per day has been used along with methotrexate to induce remission of refractory rheumatoid arthritis in cats.

The disorder has also been identified in Siamese and domestic shorthair cats. 34 All of the cats had normal PK activity. The age at the initial visit was between 6 months and 5 years (mean of 2 years). The most common presenting complaints included lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, and pale mucous membranes-signs typical of anemia. In some cats the signs were episodic. Physical examination revealed the presence of pallor and splenomegaly. As these cats age, the splenomegaly appears to become more profound. As with PK deficiency, the initial presentation may be misinterpreted for some other cause of hemolysis. Most blood samples were severely hemolyzed after an overnight stay in refrigeration. Although the PCV was most often in the range of 15% to 25%, during a hemolytic crisis it dropped to as low as 5%. The anemia was usually mildly to moderately regenerative with macrocytosis, anisocytosis, polychromasia, and an aggregate reticulocytosis. Macroscopic agglutination was present in 50% of the cats but disappeared after proper washing. The agglutination may have artifactually increased the MCV as aggregates of cells passed through the cell counter. Many cats had a lymphocytosis and polyclonal hyperglobulinemia. Retroviral tests were negative, as was a direct Coombs' test. Microscopic examination for hemoplasma infection was negative; because of the insensitivity of this test in detecting the bacteria, cats were treated with doxycycline anyway. Osmotic fragility testing is performed by placing the patient's red cells in serial dilutions of a saline solution. Because mature erythrocytes have no Na/K ATPase, the amount of water inside the cell rapidly equilibrates with that of the solution and the cell increases in volume. Hemolysis of patient erythrocytes occurs at much higher concentrations of saline than control samples. Affected erythrocytes are osmotically fragile even when there are no clinical signs. Whereas some of the cats responded to glucocorticoid administration, others improved without treatment. Splenectomy was performed in cats that did not respond or had recurrent hemolytic events. This effectively removed the organ responsible for phagocytosis of the damaged erythrocytes.",

The addition of the lowered oxygen-carrying capacity of methemoglobin caused by iron oxidation can make the signs of hypoxia appear worse than the lowered PCV would suggest. If over 15% of the hemoglobin is in the form of methemoglobin, the color of the mucosa and blood can be altered to appear darker red or brownish in color. Significant methemoglobin is rarely associated with diet or diseases that produce Heinz bodies. 14 The development and degree of anemia depends on the size, number, and rate of formation of Heinz bodies. Heinz bodies are produced at a slower rate by diet or disease compared with oxidative drugs and are less likely to be associated with acute hemolysis. Anemia is more likely when the Heinz bodies are large and affect over 30% of the erythrocytes. Heinz bodies appear dark when stained with new methylene blue stain. Ghost cells may appear on the slide if the erythrocytes are seen to be extruding the Heinz body. These cells look like empty circular rims with an attached Heinz body. As opposed to dogs, cats often have single, large Heinz bodies. The presence of many large Heinz bodies can artifactually increase the MCHC and automated leukocyte count. Once Heinz body anemia has been discovered, the veterinarian should carefully evaluate the cat for drug or onion ingestion or diabetes mellitus. It is important to search for an underlying cause for anemia even if Heinz bodies are present; they are a sign of disease, not the disease itself. Thoracic and abdominal radiography and abdominal ultrasonography may help identify any malignancies or metallic foreign bodies. Offending dietary substances may be identified on the food's package label. Owners sometimes unwittingly administer acetaminophen to cats that seem to be in pain.",

Carriers are more likely to occur after infection with Candidatus M. haemominutum than with M. haemofelis. 111 The mode of transmission is poorly understood. Traditionally, it was thought that transmission of hemoplasmas occurred by fleas (Ctenocephalides felis). Although PCR tests have documented the presence of hemoplasma DNA in flea larvae, feces, and eggs, ingestion of these did not result in transmission to cats under experimental conditions. 133 Transmission of infection has been found after fleas infected with hemoplasma fed on cats in an experimental setting. Experimental ingestion of infected blood, but not infected feline saliva, 79 also resulted in transmission of infection. Whether these results translate to the clinical setting is unknown, but this research leads to speculation that aggressive interactions between cats may also play a role in the transmission of the organism. 83 Cats infected with hemoplasmas can be males or females of any age and are brought to the veterinarian for reasons similar to those of most other cats with anemia. They are often lethargic, pale, not eating well, and losing weight. The course may be waxing and waning as circulating parasite numbers fluctuates. The severity of the clinical signs depends on the species involved, the rate of development, and the degree of anemia. Cats infected with M. haemofelis or Candidatus M. turicensis are more likely to become anemic than cats infected with Candidatus M. haemominutum.

Most of the erythrocytes will have their normal allotment of hemoglobin, so the MCHC is also in the reference range.",

In most species the anemia of iron deficiency is microcytic (decreased MCV) and hypochromic (decreased MCHC), but cats are less likely to develop these changes. 18 Early in the course of iron deficiency, the anemia is likely to be regenerative. Sufficient polychromasia and reticulocytosis may be present. 18 As iron stores are depleted, polychromasia and reticulocytosis decrease and the anemia becomes nonregenerative. The degree of anemia ranges from mild to life threatening. 129 Variations in red cell shape (poikilocytosis) 129 and fragmented erythrocytes (schistocytosis) 18 are commonly observed on the blood smear.

Lack of regeneration can be caused by decreased EPO production, decreased responsiveness of the bone marrow to EPO, decreased erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, or iron deficiency. Numerous disorders can lead to a nonregenerative anemia, including chronic renal disease, liver disease, inflammatory disease, FeLV infection, immune-mediated destruction of erythrocyte precursors, and primary bone marrow disease such as neoplasia and myelodysplasia. An anemia is nonregenerative if there are inadequate numbers of circulating aggregate reticulocytes for the degree of anemia. It is important to remember that an acute onset of anemia may also appear nonregenerative if there has not been enough time (4 to 7 days) for the bone marrow to produce and release aggregate reticulocytes.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of AID is one of exclusion. Other causes of nonregenerative anemia must first be eliminated. 86 Evidence for this mechanism of anemia may be found in the history or physical examination. Decreases in serum iron concentrations may mimic iron deficiency and are not confirmatory for either disease. Measuring serum ferritin concentrations may be helpful. In addition to being an iron-carrying protein, it is also an acute phase protein and may be elevated in inflammatory disorders. 128 Bone marrow cytology is nonspecific because changes such as myeloid hyperplasia and erythroid hypoplasia are common. This results in an increased myeloid to erythroid (M : E) ratio. 18 Therapy for AID involves treating the underlying disease. When treated successfully, the anemia should resolve within several weeks. 86 Because the anemia is evidence of regeneration; the anemia will be caused by chronic iron loss. Careful evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract may be required insofar as there may be no overt evidence of gastrointestinal disease (e.g., vomiting, melena). 93 Loss through the urinary tract from bleeding transitional cell carcinoma or cystitis is unlikely to lead to iron loss sufficient to cause anemia. 129 Diagnosis of an iron deficiency anemia can be difficult. The changes in the erythron can be similar to anemia of inflammatory disease (AID; see later discussion). Sometimes the diagnosis can be made on the basis of the history and physical examination because there will be evidence of blood loss or active inflammation. Often, more information is required. Healthy cats typically do not have visible iron stores in their bone marrow. Although the presence of iron in the bone marrow rules out iron deficiency, its absence does not prove it. 34, 128 An iron profile can prove useful (Table  25-4) . Serum iron concentrations alone are too nonspecific. 128 Assessing the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and serum ferritin concentrations can be helpful. The TIBC is a measure of the concentration of transferrin, a plasma protein that functions in iron transport. In an iron-deficient cat, transferrin (and TIBC) would be expected to be normal to slightly increased 34 in an attempt to offer more capacity for transport of iron to the cells. Because serum iron is low, the saturation of transferrin is decreased. Iron sequestration and decreased iron transport are a consequence of inflammatory disease so that transferrin concentrations (and TIBC) are decreased. 126 Ferritin is a cytoplasmic protein that stores iron in a soluble phase inside the cell. 34 In states of iron deficiency, cytoplasmic iron stores are decreased, resulting in decreased ferritin requirements and decreased plasma concentrations. Ferritin also Recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) is a genetically engineered protein used to treat anemia in humans. 19 The structure of EPO is relatively well conserved across species, allowing for biological activity of rhEPO in cats. 128 Hormone replacement using rhEPO is the treatment of choice for anemia associated with erythropoietic failure in cats with chronic renal failure. 93 Consideration for use of rhEPO should be limited to patients with severe anemia that affects quality of life. The initial dose is 100 units/kg subcutaneously three times weekly. This dose may be modified if the anemia is particularly severe without requiring a transfusion. If the PCV is less than 14%, 150 U/kg may be administered subcutaneously three times weekly. Should the patient be hypertensive or if the anemia is not particularly severe (yet still causing clinical signs), a dose of 50 U/kg may be effective in increasing the PCV while preventing a further increase in blood pressure. 93 The initial dose is continued for 8 to 12 weeks until the target PCV of 30% is reached. 19 The PCV should be measured weekly so the dose can be altered when the target is reached. 70 At that point, dosing frequency is reduced to once or twice weekly to maintain the PCV above 30%. The dosage and dosing interval must be individualized for each patient. 128 Changes in dose should be made infrequently because there is a lag between a dosage change and its effect on the PCV. Generally, the dose should not be changed more than once monthly. 93 If iatrogenic erythrocytosis occurs, the dose or dosing interval (or both) should be decreased. A cat that does not respond should be evaluated for iron deficiency, external blood loss, AID, or the development of antibodies directed against rhEPO. 19 Improper storage, handling, or administration by the owner should also be considered. 93 The drug vial should be refrigerated, and care should be taken not to vigorously shake the vial to prevent protein denaturation.",

Chronic anemia leads to vasodilation 19 to facilitate delivery of blood to the tissues. Once the anemia is corrected by using rhEPO, total peripheral resistance increases, although clinical hypertension is uncommon. In a study of cats receiving recombinant feline EPO (rfEPO), only 2 of 26 cats that responded developed hypertension requiring antihypertensive therapy. 94 Although the rhEPO molecule is very similar to the cat's endogenous EPO, it is not identical. There is enough structural variation for the immune system of some cats to recognize rhEPO as a foreign protein and mount an usually mild to moderate, specific therapy, such as blood transfusions, is usually not required. Supplementation with iron products is not recommended because the increased iron may promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria or tumor cells. 86 Occasionally, the anemia is severe, and a blood transfusion is needed. In a retrospective study, only 3 of 21 cats with nonregenerative anemia associated with inflammatory disease required a transfusion. 86 ",

Latent FeLV infections are defined as circulating antigen negative and bone marrow positive. The provirus is present in a nonreplicating form in myelomonocytic precursors in the marrow. 107 The viral particles may be identified by performing an indirect fluorescent antibody test on marrow smear or by using a PCR test. A study of a population of cats with various types of nonregenerative cytopenias of unknown origin was performed to assess the role of latent FeLV infections. All the cats had a negative test for circulating FeLV antigen. Only 2 of the 37 cats had a positive PCR test for FeLV proviral DNA in the bone marrow. The researchers concluded that FeLV latency does not play an important role in cats with nonregenerative cytopenias. 107 Any cat with anemia without obvious cause (e.g., trauma, blood loss) should be checked for the presence of FeLV antigen. If the anemia is regenerative, additional testing for blood parasites such as M. haemofelis is indicated. Therapy for cats with FeLV-associated anemia is supportive. Concurrent infection with blood parasites should be treated appropriately. Immunosuppressive immune response against it. 94 Approximately 20% to 50% of cats receiving rhEPO will develop antibodies against the protein. 91, 128 These antibodies usually develop in cats receiving rhEPO for longer than 4 weeks. 128 Unfortunately, these antibodies block the biological effects not only of rhEPO but also of the cat's endogenous EPO. 94 This can lead to a life-threatening red cell aplasia as the patient's PCV drops to below pretreatment levels. This condition is reversible with cessation of the drug, but it may be months before the PCV recovers. 70 Until that time transfusions may be necessary to support the cat. After developing antibodies against rhEPO, its use is contraindicated. Because of the development of these antibodies, rhEPO should be reserved for patients most in need. Proper client education and communication are important when making decisions regarding the use of this therapy.",

Unexpectedly, 8 of the 26 cats receiving rfEPO redeveloped a nonregenerative anemia after an initial response. It was postulated that perhaps there are variations in the endogenous EPO in the cat population, allowing immune response against the molecule. Other possible targets of an immune reaction are the carbohydrate moiety on the molecule or some additive in the rfEPO preparation. 94 Darbepoietin is a longer acting form of rhEPO. Anecdotally, it seems to have similar efficacy and safety as rhEPO. 97 It can be administered as a weekly injection and may be less immunogenic in animals, but this has not been documented. Darbepoietin acts similarly to EPO by stimulating erythropoiesis in the bone marrow. Adverse effects in animals are unknown but are likely similar to rhEPO because darbepoietin causes increased erythropoiesis and improved oxygen delivery to tissues.

Primary or idiopathic myelofibrosis is a disorder of dysplastic megakaryocytes, which produce cytokines that induce proliferation of fibroblasts. 52 Secondary myelofibrosis in cats is associated with immunemediated anemia, myelodysplasia, acute myelogenous leukemia, CRD, 125 and FeLV infection. 52 Most commonly, a moderate to severe nonregenerative anemia is found in cats. 125 Myelofibrosis should be suspected when repeated bone marrow aspirates are unsuccessful, and definitive diagnosis is based on finding excessive fibroblasts on histopathologic examination of a bone marrow core biopsy. 52 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) comprises a group of proliferative hematologic disorders originating from a mutation in a hematopoietic stem cell. 125 Most cats are anemic, and many have other cytopenias.

Inflammation from many different causes increases demands for neutrophils, and the bone marrow responds through increased release of stored mature neutrophils and accelerated production of new neutrophils. If the bone marrow can supply enough neutrophils to meet the needs of the inflamed tissue, there should be increases in the number of mature and immature neutrophils in the circulation. This is called a regenerative left shift and is characterized by a neutrophilia with an increased number of band neutrophils. A left shift should not be thought of as just the result of a bacterial infection, although this is a common cause. Immature neutrophils representing greater than 10% of the neutrophils in a cat with neutropenia is also called a regenerative left shift.",

            "text": "A neutrophil count below the reference range for the laboratory may be caused by overwhelming tissue needs, decreased production or abnormal release of neutrophils by the bone marrow, or immune-mediated destruction (Box 25-4) . Deficient neutrophil production is caused by infection with FeLV, FIV, or feline parvovirus (panleukopenia); drug administration; or myelophthisis. Because the half-life of circulating neutrophils, at 7 to 10 hours, is shorter than that for erythrocytes or platelets, neutropenia is often the first evidence of bone marrow disease. Approximately half of cats with FeLV-related disease have neutropenia. 43 Mild neutropenia appears to be the most common change and is associated with mild lymphopenia and normal hematopoiesis. Moderate neutropenia is associated with hypoplastic bone marrow and must be differentiated from infection with feline parvovirus. 43 Severe neutropenia is caused by ineffective maturation and release of neutrophils by the bone marrow and is associated with a paradoxical marrow granulocyte hyperplasia because the cells produced are not released to the circulation effectively. FeLV can also cause a cyclic neutropenia, with the lowest neutrophil count occurring every 8 to 18 days. 43 Occasionally, a healthy cat will be identified with neutropenia after a CBC is performed as part of wellness or preanesthestic testing. It is often difficult to know how aggressively this finding should be pursued. The history and physical examination should be revisited in a more thorough manner. The veterinarian should ensure that a blood smear has been examined to confirm the neutropenia. A new blood sample of adequate volume should be collected for a repeated CBC to eliminate laboratory or blood collection errors. 13 If the cat is easygoing, the sample may be collected after exposure to a mild stressful event such as running tap water. Epinephrine secretion will mobilize neutrophils from the marginated pool into the circulating pool for sampling. If the neutrophil count is over 2 \u00d7 10 9 /L, monitoring the cat's temperature and attitude at home is probably sufficient. 85 Another reason for an apparently healthy cat to have a mild neutropenia is the manner in which laboratory reference ranges are determined. The reference range is designed to catch 90% of normal patients, meaning that 5% of normal cats will fall below the reference range for neutrophil counts and be considered neutropenic despite being normal for that individual. Sometimes the neutrophil count will persist below 1 \u00d7 10 9 /L, necessitating further investigation. A serum biochemical profile and urinalysis should be performed if not already done. Urine can also be collected for culture. The cat's retroviral status should be ascertained and imaging of the chest and abdomen performed to look for abnormalities. If the neutropenia persists for more than 1 week, the veterinarian should consider performing a bone marrow examination in an attempt to catch bone marrow disease early. 13 An afebrile cat with a neutrophil count below 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L has an increased risk of infection with normal gastrointestinal, nasal cavity, or skin bacteria. Broadspectrum antibiotics should be administered when",

Factor Xa activates and combines with factor V (Va). Factors Xa and Va combine with ionized calcium (Ca 2+ ) and phospholipid on the platelet membrane, which localizes the formation of thrombin from prothrombin to the area of the platelet plug. The formation of thrombin is the beginning of the common pathway. Thrombin catalyzes the conversion of motility. 10 The large granules found in the neutrophils are friable and rupture spontaneously, causing tissue damage such as cataracts noted in cats with this disease. 115 Impaired natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic lymphocyte function has also been identified. Abnormal platelet granule release results in impaired platelet aggregation and an increased buccal mucosal bleeding time. Diagnosis is based on signalment, history, and physical findings. A few large, eosinophilic granules can be found in the neutrophils, and comparison of the hair shafts of affected animals to those of normal cats reveals large melanin granules in the affected cat. 10 At present, there is no cure for the disease. Care should be taken to avoid and control hemorrhage in affected cats. Use of drugs known to cause platelet dysfunction is contraindicated. Administration of recombinant canine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rcG-CSF) or IL-2 has been shown temporarily to improve neutrophil function. A bone marrow transplant may resolve the neutrophil and platelet dysfunction, but the neurologic and renal changes will remain. 10 Affected cats should not be bred, and their unaffected parents, who are obligate carriers, should be removed from breeding programs.",

Its sole purpose is to seal the defects in vessel walls that occur in health and disease until they can be mended. Disorders of this system can lead to clinically significant thrombocytopenia as the platelets are consumed in an attempt to control the bleeding. However, the decrease is usually mild insofar as thrombopoiesis ramps up quickly and the spleen releases sequestered platelets. Very low platelet counts in bleeding cats are usually the cause of the bleeding, not caused by bleeding. 66 Reduced activity or concentrations of clotting factors can be congenital or acquired and result in secondary hemostatic disorders (Table 25 -5) . Factor XII deficiency is the most common congenital coagulopathy in cats. 89 This is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in prolongation of the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or activated clotting time (ACT). Because in vivo generation of fibrin does not require activated factor XII, no spontaneous bleeding is associated with this defect. It is most often identified in the course of a preoperative evaluation before an elective surgery or invasive diagnostic procedure such as a liver biopsy. 12 Factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B) also results in prolongation of the PTT and ACT. 38 This is an X-linked recessive disorder that may lead to bleeding in severely affected male cats. As with all bleeding from factor deficiencies, hematomas and cavitary bleeding are most likely. A definitive diagnosis is based on identification of decreased factor IX activity. Once the gene encoding the feline factor IX protein is sequenced, a genetic test may become fibrinogen to soluble fibrin and amplifies the coagulation process by activating other procoagulant factors, particularly those of the intrinsic pathway. Finally, after activation by thrombin, factor XIIIa catalyzes the crosslinking of the fibrin strands into an insoluble mesh that stabilizes the platelet plug produced by primary hemostasis.",

Therefore it is more appropriate to consider the extrinsic pathway as the initiator of coagulation and the intrinsic pathway as the sustainer or amplifier of coagulation. 103 Inhibition of coagulation prevents excessive and uncontrolled clot formation. Antithrombin (AT), previously known as antithrombin 3, is produced by the liver and inhibits the actions of thrombin, IXa, Xa, and XIa. The presence of heparin on the surface of the vascular endothelial cell augments the function of AT and helps control clot formation at the edges of the damaged vessel localizing the clot to the damaged area. 103 Like factors II, VII, IX and X, synthesis of protein C and protein S is vitamin K 1 dependent, and they are released in inactive form by the liver. After binding to thrombomodulin on the endothelial cell, thrombin loses its coagulant activity and activates protein C, which combines with protein S to inactivate factors V and VIII. 103",

Once trauma has been ruled out, diagnostic evaluation of a bleeding cat revolves around deciding if the abnormality is with primary or secondary hemostasis or both. The initial step is to perform a CBC with a platelet count A combination of primary and secondary disorders may be found in cats with DIC. In one retrospective study, 21 of 69 cats with hemostatic abnormalities had laboratory evidence of DIC, the most common hemostatic abnormality. Most of these cats did not have clinically significant bleeding. Neoplasia, feline infectious peritonitis, and hepatic disease were the most common causes of DIC in this study. 89 Another study identified neoplasia and pancreatitis as the most common diseases associated with DIC. 24 Only 7 of the 46 cats with DIC in this study had evidence of hemorrhage. DIC consists of excessive thrombin formation combined with the loss of inhibitory control and stimulation of inflammation. 105 Normally kept out of circulation by the vascular endothelium, intravascular production of tissue factor by neoplastic cells or inflammatory cytokine-stimulated monocytes initiates DIC. 105 The initial phase of DIC is hypercoagulable, with inhibitors counterbalancing the formation of thrombin. This is the non-overt or compensated stage of DIC. Although difficult to detect clinically, treatment at this stage may prevent progression to the next stage. When coagulation inhibitors are overwhelmed, widespread microthrombosis occurs, leading to tissue hypoxia and death. This overt or decompensated phase is clinically important in the deterioration of the patient's condition. In the study by Estrin and coworkers, 24 43 of 46 cats with DIC died or were euthanized. The thrombotic stage is much more common than the hemorrhagic stage of DIC, as demonstrated by the few cats in DIC that bleed. 24 The late stage occurs when there is consumption of clotting factors and platelets. Neoplasms can also cause hemostatic abnormalities by causing thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction or by producing procoagulants. Inhibition of clotting factors and intrinsic anticoagulants are also potential mechanisms by which substances produced by neoplasms can affect the clotting system.",

Using sodium citrate as an anticoagulant can reduce, but not eliminate, the amount of clumping. A normal platelet count reported by the laboratory is probably normal and can be trusted. A low platelet count reported by an automated cell counter should always be confirmed by a manual count or by examination of a fresh blood smear. Estimation of platelet numbers is performed by examining the monolayer of a smear (which is an essential part of a CBC anyway) under oil immersion and counting the number of platelets in 5 to 10 fields. The average number of platelets per oil field is multiplied by 20 to get the number of platelets \u00d7 10 9 /L. 66 Many clumps suggest a normal number of platelets. A smear examination also allows for identification of shift platelets, evidence of increased marrow production of platelets. The presence of shift platelets precludes the necessity for collecting bone marrow. FeLV infection, a common cause of thrombocytopenia, is also associated with increased platelet volume. 44 Spontaneous bleeding caused by thrombocytopenia in cats usually occurs only when the platelet count is lower than 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L. 51 If bleeding occurs in a cat with a platelet count above this, the veterinarian should consider a concurrent platelet function defect or a secondary hemostatic problem. Because the BMBT evaluates hemostatic abnormalities resulting from platelet disorders in addition to problems with the vascular endothelium, it is unnecessary to perform this test when platelet counts are severely depressed. A prolonged BMBT in a cat with a platelet count over 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L suggests a vessel problem such as vasculitis or an inherited collagen defect, congenital or acquired platelet dysfunction, or von Willebrand disease. A detailed history should eliminate the possible exposure to drugs that can cause platelet dysfunction. Platelet function testing is usually performed only by special hemostasis laboratories and often requires freshly drawn blood samples.",

The test is rather insensitive insofar as it will be normal until more than 65% of the factor activity is lost 103 and is not affected by thrombocytopenia. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) evaluates the intrinsic (amplification pathway) and common pathways by activating factor XII to initiate clotting.

Retroviral testing is imperative because FeLV is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. Thoracic radiography and abdominal ultrasonography might identify evidence of bacterial bronchitis or abdominal masses or organomegaly that may be responsible for immunemediated thrombocytopenia or DIC. Sampling the bone marrow may yield clues as to the cause of unidentified thrombocytopenia.

The next most common cause was various types of malignancy, which affected 16 (39%) of the cats. 51 Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (IMTP) is caused by the removal of antibody-coated platelets by macrophages in the spleen. Similar to IMHA, these antibodies may be directed against antigens on the surface of the platelet or against antigens similar in structure to platelet antigens. Disease may reveal hidden antigens on the platelet surface. Antigen-antibody complexes may deposit on the platelet membrane and elicit a type 3 hypersensitivity response (innocent bystander destruction). Platelets also have Fc receptors on their surface and may bind the Fc portion of an antibody to these receptors. Antiplatelet antibodies may also contribute to platelet dysfunction. 132 Because primary IMTP is rare in cats, it is important not to immediately administer immunosuppressive doses of glucocorticoids to cats with thrombocytopenia.

Polyuria and polydipsia may occur; the pathogenesis is unclear, and it resolves after splenectomy. 2 The most reliable physical finding in cats with splenic disease is splenomegaly. The enlargement may be generalized or focal. However, not all enlarged spleens are abnormal, nor are they always palpable. Gentle palpation is important because a diseased spleen is often friable and may rupture with rough handling. Other physical changes may be present depending on the primary disease. Peripheral or abdominal lymph node enlargement may be present. At times, it is difficult to differentiate splenomegaly from enlargement of the liver.",

Generalized enlargement (or splenomegaly) can be caused by congestion or by infiltration with neoplastic or inflammatory cells and is the most common type found in cats. 113 Focal enlargement can be caused by neoplastic or non-neoplastic lesions. The nonsinusoidal nature of the feline spleen decreases its susceptibility to the formation of nodular hyperplasia and hematomas. 113 Visualizing the spleen is important in determining the type of enlargement. Abdominal radiography allows for easy visualization of the spleen, although the location varies owing to its mobility within the abdomen. The head of the spleen is located caudal to the stomach and cranial to the left kidney and appears triangular on a between 10% and 20% of the circulation erythrocyte mass and up to 30% of the platelets. 68, 113 There are three patterns of blood flow through the spleen. Under normal conditions most (90%) of the blood enters the rapid pool and flows through the spleen in 30 seconds. The remainder flows through in approximately 8 minutes (the intermediate pool) or 60 minutes (the slow pool). Blood can be shunted in and out of these pools as needed during times of stress. Because of the nonsinusoidal nature of the feline spleen, splenic contraction does not result in the movement of as many erythrocytes into the circulation as it does in dogs. 84 Most of the stored platelets are in the slow pool. Iron from recycled erythrocytes is stored in the spleen while awaiting transport to the bone marrow for use in the production of hemoglobin for incorporation into new erythrocytes.",

As erythrocytes squeeze through the parenchyma, they come into contact with macrophages whose function is to remove rigid particulate matter from the cell. These particles include parasites, nuclear remnants (Howell-Jolly bodies), and denatured hemoglobin (Heinz bodies). The high metabolic activity in the spleen results in areas with a slightly anaerobic environment. 113 The decreased oxygen content causes the cell membrane of old, badly damaged, or abnormal erythrocytes to stiffen. This renders them unable to undergo the deformation required to pass through the sinuses, and they are removed from circulation. 113 These cells, and those coated in antibodies, are phagocytosed by nearby macrophages, which process the hemoglobin and recycle the iron. Owing to the nonsinusoidal nature of the feline spleen, the cat is less efficient at removing these cells than is the dog and is one reason that normal cats have higher numbers of Heinz bodies present in the circulation. In addition to obsolete erythrocytes, the spleen also removes bacteria from the blood. 68 The fetal hematopoietic function of the spleen in cats ceases at birth. 68 In situations of increased need overwhelming the bone marrow, the adult spleen can resume these functions. These conditions can include infiltrative bone marrow disease, immune-mediated hemolysis or thrombocytopenia, inflammatory or infectious diseases, and malignancy.

The endothelium in the medulla is discontinuous, allowing for exposure of fluid and particles to the immune cells. Between the cortex and medulla is the paracortical area containing small T cells and macrophages acting as antigen-presenting cells. 46 The lymph node functions as a filter of interstitial fluid. It retains particles, cells, and antigens brought to it by the afferent lymphatics. The best known function of the lymph node is as an immune organ. All the cell types (B cells, T cells, macrophages, and plasma cells) required for an immune response are brought together in the lymph node. 81 These functions form the basis for explaining why a lymph node enlarges. Proliferation of the normal population of immune cells in response to antigens presented to the lymph node will cause it to enlarge, as will neoplastic proliferation of the resident cells. Enlargement will also occur when there is infiltration by inflammatory or neoplastic cells from processes in the region drained by the lymph node. Etiologies causing lymphadenopathy can be found in Boxes 25-7 and 25-8. Neoplastic enlargement is discussed in Chapter 28.",

Two were euthanized because of the positive FeLV status; the other eight were followed for 5 years. One cat developed mediastinal lymphosarcoma, and six experienced complete resolution of the lymphadenopathy over a 2-to 28-week period. The remaining cat had episodic lymphadenopathy. The cause of the spontaneous lymph node hyperplasia in these young cats was not determined.

Circulating non-cell-associated receptors for the cytokines may be present to prevent systemic actions if some should reach the circulation. 23 Normal embryonic development may be affected by alterations in cytokine concentrations, leading to birth defects. 23 Hematopoiesis is modified by the presence or absence of EPO, thrombopoietin (TPO), or colonystimulating factors (Figure 25-18 ).

Activated macrophages elaborate various cytokines important in the acute inflammatory response by altering vascular permeability, increasing endothelial leukocyte adhesion and leukocyte chemotaxis (Box 25-9). The acute phase inflammatory response is, in part, mediated by cytokines secreted by these macrophages.

These interleukins activate natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes, and macrophages. IL-12 is secreted by activated macrophages with subsequent activation and recruitment of new T h 1 cells, thereby acting as a positive feedback loop to amplify the cell-mediated immune response. IL-12 is also a potent stimulator of NK cell and cytotoxic lymphocytes. Large, extracellular parasites activate T h 2 cells to secrete interleukins that result in augmentation of the humoral arm of the immune system. 48 Increases in B lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells follow. T h 2 cells also release the antiinflammatory interleukins, IL-4 and IL-10. These potent inhibitors of INF-gamma secretion by T h 1 cells act to reduce cell-mediated immune activity. These two interleukins also stimulate activation of B lymphocytes and the production of IL-10, an immunosuppressive cytokine. Antibodies against the cytokine or its receptor may help reduce its activity. Inactivation may also be accomplished by the use of direct cytokine antagonists or administration of their receptors in soluble form. IL-2 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP) has shown promise in reducing the severity of inflammatory bowel disease. 23 Manipulation of a single cytokine may trigger mechanisms that control its activity and neutralize or enhance its effect. 114 No treatment is without potential adverse effects, and cytokine therapy is no exception.

Assessment of individual cytokines may present opportunities for intervention in the disease process. Many different body systems and individual infectious diseases have been examined with regard to cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is produced by cardiac myocytes in response to ventricular pressure overload in cats with cardiomyopathy and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiac cachexia, ventricular dysfunction, and the development of congestive heart failure. 73 Evaluations of the cytokine profiles of the nasal and oral cavities in cats suggest that a T h 1 profile of cytokines is present to protect against bacterial and viral infections of these tissues. An increase in T h 1 cytokines is associated with progression of the signs and histologic changes of nasal cavity disease. Humans with allergic rhinitis have T h 2 profiles. 50 IL-4-producing lymphocytes have been found in lesional and nonlesional skin from cats with allergic dermatitis, but not from the skin of healthy control cats, which suggests a role for IL-4 in allergic skin disease in this species. 96 IL-5, thought to be a major regulator for eosinophils, was not correlated with the number of eosinophils in cats with suspected allergic dermatitis, whereas IL-2 was. 80 This is an example of an investigation with a conclusion that steers therapeutic intervention away from what theory suggests should be effective. Antibodies against IL-5 and IL-5 receptor blockers are under investigation for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome. 134 Inflammatory disease in other body systems would seem to be reasonable areas of investigation. Indeed, cytokine evaluation in cats with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an ongoing area of interest. Nguyen Van and coworkers found a statistically significant increase in both proinflammatory and regulatory cytokine expression in cats with inflammatory lesions of the intestine compared with those without inflammation. They concluded that the pathogenesis of IBD involves aberrations in both regulatory and inflammatory aspects of the immune system. 82 The ACVIM consensus statement on gastrointestinal inflammation suggests that a role for decreased immunoregulation is predicted in the pathogenesis of IBD in cats based on the cytokine profile from humans and rodents. 123 The pathogenesis and response to treatment of allergic airway disease in cats involves mast cells. 48 Of course, there is never stimulation or inhibition of only T h 1 or T h 2 cells; a balance must be maintained, or illness ensues.",

The receptor for G-CSF is found on both immature and mature neutrophils and stimulates proliferation and maturation of neutrophils. G-CSF also enhances neutrophil chemotaxis and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and increases the expression of Fc receptors on the neutrophil surface. 63 A neutrophilia reliably occurs 24 hours after administration of recombinant human (rh)-G-CSF to healthy cats and is useful in preventing chemotherapeutic neutropenia. Using G-CSF to reverse an established neutropenia, such as seen in cats with FeLV infection, is unrewarding. The action of rh-G-CSF in cats ends when the patient starts making antibodies against the cytokine. The recombinant canine product, however, retains its efficacy, suggesting that antibodies are not produced. 63 Granulocyte monocyte (GM)-CSF is made in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, T lymphocytes, and monocytes. The targeted cells are neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and their respective progenitor cells. GM-CSF prolongs the survival of the target cells and enhances their function.

            "text": "The changes resulting from SLE are due to inflammation of the affected body part. Dysregulation of the immune system (possibly the result of abnormal function of T suppressor cells) leads to an attack against the body's self-antigens and is responsible for the inflammation. Circulating antigen-autoantibody complexes deposit in the vessel walls of the synovium, glomerulus, or choroid plexus (type 3 hypersensitivity). Complement is alterations in cytokine profiles. An imbalance in cytokine production favoring T h 2 cell products in response to environmental aeroallergens is thought to be a major part of the pathogenesis of this disease. 101 These T h 2derived cytokines lead to increased production of allergen-specific IgE. Investigators are evaluating different substances for their efficacy in altering or inhibiting the activity of these cytokines. 101 Even behavior can be affected by cytokines. Increased IL-2 in certain areas of the brain has been found to potentiate defensive rage behavior in cats. 5 Perhaps the most important area of study of cytokines is in the pathogenesis and treatment of infectious diseases. This area of study may be important in designing prevention and therapies for infections with FIV. Increased IL-10, an immunosuppressive T h 2 cytokine, was found in the early stages of FIV infection corresponding to high viral replication. This was followed by an increase in IFN-gamma levels to bring the ratio back into balance. The increase in IFN-gamma was associated with a decreased tissue viral load. 3 In a challenge study, cats infected with FIV and then challenged with Toxoplasma gondii infections produced significantly lower amounts of T h 1 (proinflammatory) cytokines compared with challenged FIV-negative controls. The FIV-positive cats also maintained the elevated levels of IL-10 found before the challenge with T. gondii. 61 Imbalances in T h 1 versus T h 2 cytokines were also suggested as a cause for the development of lesions in the neurologic form of FIP. It was also thought that a failure to increase IFN-gamma concentrations in the infected tissues might be an important reason these cats succumbed to the FIP infection. 30 Another example of using a cytokine for the treatment of infectious disease is the use of rhIFN-alpha to treat cats with FeLV infections. 23 Although the use of cytokines holds great promise for feline medicine, much research must still be performed to fully understand the complexity of the system and the implications of manipulating it and to develop new strategies for using cytokines to intervene in the management of sick cats.",

A CBC, serum biochemical profile, ANA test, and urinalysis should be performed along with thoracic radiographs to rule out potential bronchial infections. The ANA test is relatively sensitive in identifying anti-self antibodies. The results are reported as a titer along with an immunofluorescence pattern that is clinically insignificant. 106 Many false-positive and false-negative tests occur. False-positive tests may occur in cats with infectious, neoplastic, or chronic inflammatory diseases. About 10% of healthy cats will have a low titer for ANA. 106 Therefore a high ANA titer is more consistent with SLE than is a low titer. A lupus erythematosus (LE) cell preparation identifies neutrophils with phagocytosed nuclei in the cytoplasm. Interpretation depends on the experience of the technician, and many false-negatives occur. 106 Because of the difficulty in performing the test and problems with sensitivity, it has largely been replaced with the ANA test. If there is evidence of a regenerative anemia, the veterinarian should perform a Coombs' test and a PCR test for hemotrophic mycoplasmosis. The cat's retroviral status should also be ascertained. If there is joint pain or effusion, synovial fluid should be obtained for cytology; the synovial neutrophils should be well preserved in a cat with SLE. If the neutrophils are lytic or if bacteria are present, a culture of the fluid should be performed. 69 Cats with azotemia and proteinuria should have the urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio measured.

This occurs rapidly, with evidence of their effects appearing within seconds to minutes of exposure to the antigen. These mediators, which include but are not limited to histamine, heparin, kallikrein, and inflammatory cell chemotactic factors, result in physiologic changes responsible for many of the clinical signs recognized as anaphylactic shock. Histamine bound to H 1 receptors causes smooth muscle contraction in the intestinal tract and in the airways and pulmonary vasculature. H 1 activation also results in increased vascular permeability and neutrophil and eosinophil chemotaxis. Binding to the H 2 receptor is followed by increased production of airway mucus and bronchodilation. The balance between H 1 and H 2 stimulation results in hypotension, bronchospasm, airway obstruction, hyperperistalsis, increased vascular permeability, and pruritus. 15 Chemotactic factors amplify the inflammatory reaction by recruiting neutrophils and eosinophils. Consequences of the release of other mast cell mediators include complement activation, enhanced smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability, and stimulation of pain sensors. 121 Phospholipase A 2 acts on the phospholipids in the cell membranes to form arachidonic acid. Although blood products may be used to replace clotting factors consumed in the process. The addition of heparin alone to augment the effectiveness of the transfusion is controversial.

The owner may be concerned about a lump found while petting the cat or enlarged lymph nodes may be discovered during a physical examination for a vague illness or during a wellness visit. Questions should be directed at identifying potential underlying illness, as well as the duration of the changes. It is also important to find out how fast the lump is growing. Normally palpable lymph nodes include the mandibular, superficial cervical (prescapular), and popliteal. The ileocecocolic lymph node is sometimes palpable in normal cats. All these nodes are more difficult to palpate in cats than in dogs. 81 The fat surrounding a lymph node in an obese cat may give the impression of increased size; however, with more careful palpation the firmer node can be felt in the middle of the fat. If there is significant inflammation, the enlarged lymph node may be painful and the area warm to the touch. Clinical signs in other areas may be",
