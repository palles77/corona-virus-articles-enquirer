The immune tolerance of the liver also might account for the survival of liver allografts and diverse hepatic inflammatory diseases, 2 which highlights the importance of understanding the nature of hepatic immune regulation. Two crucial mechanisms have been proposed for liver tolerance. First, the liver is unlike any other organ in the T-cell biology, as best illustrated by inactivation, tolerance, and apoptosis. 4 Second, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and Kupffer cells play significant roles in the distinctive constraints on hepatic T cells. [5] [6] [7] [8] The exact molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatic T-cell immune regulation, however, have not been elucidated.",

Even so, the understanding of cell-surface regulators for T-cell immunity has been greatly expanded by the introduction of the lectin superfamily. 9 For example, the C-type lectin macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin (MGL) on dendritic cells (DCs) negatively regulates effector T cells via interaction with CD45. 10 A genomewide association study identified the predicted C-type lectin KIAA0350 as a type 1 diabetes gene, suggesting its regulatory role in the activation of cytotoxic T cells. 11 It is clear that lectins are crucial players in immune tolerance and homeostasis, and are involved in diseases of the immune system. It is noteworthy that several lectins also are localized to the liver, although no lectins have been confirmed to be T-cell regulators in the liver thus far.",

We generated LSECtin knockout (KO) mice and observed an increased accumulation of T cells in liver in the absence of LSECtin. In mice with T-cellmediated acute liver injury, the lack of LSECtin accelerated the disease owing to an increased T-cell immune response, whereas the exogenous administration of recombinant LSECtin protein or plasmid ameliorated the disease by down-regulating T-cell immunity. Thus, our results reveal a crucial mechanism by which hepatic T-cell immunity is controlled by the C-type lectin LSECtin.",

To test this hypothesis we screened a series of cell lines to identify the LSECtin ligand by flow cytometry. We found that LSECtin-Fc interacted with the CEM and Jurkat T cell lines ( Figure 1A ). Moreover, when tested after stimulation with phorbol-12myristate-13-acetate (PMA) combination with ionomycin, Jurkat T cells showed markedly increased binding of LSECtin, and this binding required the presence of Ca 2\u03e9 because it was inhibited by addition of the calcium chelator ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N=,N=-tetraace-tic acid (EGTA) ( Figure 1B ). We then sought to determine whether LSECtin receptor is expressed naturally on T cells in vivo. By using flow cytometry analysis, we found that LSECtin-Fc specifically bound peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) activated by PMA and ionomycin, and this interaction could be inhibited completely by the addition of EGTA ( Figure 1C ). However, LSECtin did not bind nonactivated PBMCs. To verify T-cell binding, we purified either CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 cells from PBMCs by positive selection using antibody-coated magnetic beads. LSECtin showed strong binding to activated CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells ( Figure 1D ). To confirm the interaction of LSECtin and T cells at a cellular level, cell-cell adhesion experiments were performed to assess the adhesion of peripheral blood T cells to LSECtin transfectants. Activated peripheral blood T cells specifically adhered to MCF7 cells expressing LSECtin compared with background binding to parental MCF7 cells. This binding was inhibited by a blocking antibody to LSECtin ( Figure 1E and F), confirming the specificity of the interaction.",

To assess the contribution of N-or O-linked glycosylation in LSECtin adhesion, activated T cells were cultured in the presence of tunicamycin or benzyl-\u2423-GalNAc, which could block the formation of proteins N-or Oglycosidic linkages, respectively. Tunicamycin abrogated the adhesion of T cells to LSECtin, whereas benzyl-\u2423-GalNAc did not ( Figure 2B ). Amino acid sequence alignment of the CRD of LSECtin with that of other C-type lectins indicates that 4 amino acids, Glu254, Asn256, Asn 274, and Asp275, interact with Ca 2\u03e9 through their carbonyl groups, and Glu254/Asn256 exist in a conserved EPN motif, which is important for carbohydrate recognition. 12, 19 Thus, we generated a series of LSECtin point mutants, including N256D, N274D, and D275A, in the soluble isoform. Alteration of each residue completely abolished the binding of LSECtin-Fc to T cells ( Figure  2C ), compared with the control substitution L231A. These results indicate that LSECtin binds to activated T cells through a protein-glycan interaction.",

We cultured peripheral blood T cells with anti-CD3 mAb and LSECtin-Fc for 72 hours and found that the up-regulation of cell surface activation molecules, including CD69 and CD25, was inhibited by LSECtin ( Figure 3A ). Proliferation was estimated by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, and it was found that LSECtin significantly decreased T-cell proliferation stimulated by anti-CD3 ( Figure 3B ). To examine the effects of soluble LSECtin ligation on the production of cytokines, culture supernatants from T-cell proliferation assays, as shown previously, were harvested at 48 hours. Secretion of IFN-\u2425, IL-2, and IL-10 was inhibited signif-icantly by LSECtin-Fc, although the production of transforming growth factor-\u2424 was not affected ( Figure 3C ). To further test whether LSECtin on the cell surface inhibits T-cell responses, we established a stably expressing CHO cell line of LSECtin (CHO-LSECtin). PBMCs were cocultured with irradiated CHO-LSECtin cells or mock CHO cells and soluble anti-CD3 mAb for 48 hours. Membrane-bound LSECtin decreased the secretion of IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 in the culture supernatants of PBMCs; on the other hand, its siRNA reversed this effect ( Figure 3D ). The negative effect of LSECtin also was observed in the presence of anti-CD28 mAb ( Figure 3E ), suggesting that the suppression cannot be overcome by co-stimulation. To study antigen-specific signals, we examined the effects of LSECtin on T cells that were expressing an OVAspecific TCR transgene. The secretion of IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 was shown to be inhibited significantly by LSECtin-Fc ( Figure 3F ).",

We first tried a protein therapeutic approach in which we directly administered recombinant soluble LSECtin before Con A via the tail. It was found that LSECtin protein significantly reduced disease severity, as illustrated by H&E and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling staining, and remarkably decreased serum ALT/AST levels ( Figure 7A and B) . However, when given after Con A, LSECtin could not reverse established inflammation (Supplementary Figure 4) . To confirm whether the protective effect was caused by suppression of T-cell activity, we determined the infiltrating lymphocyte subpopulations in the liver. A significant decrease in T-cell infiltration was detected in the livers of LSECtin-Fc-treated mice ( Figure 7C ). Moreover, LSECtin-Fc treatment decreased the numbers of TNF-\u2423and IFN-\u2425producing T cells in liver ( Figure 7D) . A soluble LSECtin cDNA plasmid was transfected into mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. To rule out the possibility that the soluble LSECtin protein blocks the interaction between LSECs and activated T cells, a full-length LSECtin cDNA encoding the membrane-bound protein also was transfected into mice by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. The expression of each in plasma and liver was confirmed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay and Q-PCR, respectively (Supplementary Figure 5) . Considerable protective effects were observed in the transfected mice, which showed both a tremendous decrease in plasma ALT and AST levels ( Figure 7E ) and a clear amelioration of the histologic damage of hepatitis ( Figure 7F ). Thus, it could be concluded that LSECtin is not only a significant negative checkpoint in modulating hepatic T-cell activation, but also a new promising therapeutic target for acute liver inflammatory injury.",

The dual functions of the liver require a delicate balance between immunity and tolerance. 3, 21 The mechanisms behind the unique immune tolerance of liver have been elucidated in the past few years. One of the principal findings is that the T-cell biology in the liver is unlike that in any other organ, highlighted by the remarkable preference for the inactivation, tolerance, and apoptosis of hepatic T cells. 4 In TCR transgenic mice, activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells dispersed from the lymph nodes and spleen, and an increased number of activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells simultaneously were found undergoing apoptosis in the liver. 22 This phenomenon appears to be specific and is evident in a variety of in vivo model systems, suggesting that the liver is a \"graveyard\" or \"killing field\" for activated T cells. 2 In a mouse liver transplant model, CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells were found to infiltrate significantly and then undergo apoptosis in liver allografts. 23 Moreover, many clinical investigations have shown that intrahepatic hepatitis C virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells have functional alterations, including weak IFN-\u2425 production, impaired proliferation, and enhanced apoptosis, which is associated with viral persistence and the progression of the disease to a chronic phase. 24, 25 Obviously, the unique T-cell immune response contributes greatly to specific hepatic tolerance. The exact molecular mechanisms underlying hepatic immune regulation, however, have not been elucidated clearly.",

Dong et al 26 discovered an important role for B7-H1 in controlling the deletion of activated intrahepatic CD8 \u03e9 T cells in the liver via a PD-1-independent mechanism. 26 It is highly likely that hepatic immune regulation is multifactorial. Furthermore, the broad expression of B7-H1 in vivo makes it difficult to solely explain the unique characteristics of hepatic immunity.

            "text": "LSECtin is expressed specifically in LSECs and Kupffer cells. Its specific localization and roles in the negative regulation of T cells give rise to its important function in hepatic immunity and tolerance induction. Indeed, we showed that LSECtin negatively regulates T-cell receptormediated signaling and T-cell immune response stimulated by plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb; this suppression could not be overcome by co-stimulation. Moreover, the role of LSECtin in the antigen-specific activation of T cells was analyzed using T cells from TCR transgenic mice and murine LSECs with physiologic levels of LSECtin expression. The lack of LSECtin in mice resulted in increased accumulation of T cells in the liver both in normal mice and in DO11.10 TCR transgenic T-cell transfer mice. In mice with T-cell-mediated acute liver injury, KO of LSECtin accelerated the disease caused by an increased T-cell immune response, whereas exogenous administration of recombinant LSECtin protein or plasmid ameliorated the disease via down-regulation of T-cell immunity. Thus, our study provides important insight into the molecular mechanism of hepatic T-cell constraint based on investigation of the liver-specific C-type lectin LSECtin.",

            "text": "Recently, the importance of C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) was highlighted by the fact that they have a crucial immune regulatory role. First, CLRs on the surface of DCs could sense the extracellular environment and modulate cellular responses, especially the TLR-dependent inflammatory response. 27 Second, CLRs reversibly could modulate T-cell receptor signaling and exert effects on those immune cells. 10 This strongly implies that CLRs are important players in immune activation, tolerance, and homeostasis, and are involved in diseases of the immune system. It is noteworthy that several lectins also are localized to the liver, including galectin-1, 7 DC-SIGN, and L-SIGN. 28 None of the lectins, however, has been confirmed to be a T-cell regulator in liver thus far. In the present study, we showed that the liverspecific C-type lectin LSECtin recognized activated T cells and negatively regulated T-cell immune response in the liver. Our study not only expands the knowledge about BASIC-LIVER, PANCREAS, AND BILIARY TRACT",

Undoubtedly, research on the mechanisms of hepatic immune regulation will provide new perspectives on liver physiology, and this knowledge will be translated rapidly into more effective therapies in the near future, 29 similar to the noticeable progress with the T-cell regulator B7-H1 in liver diseases and other inflammatory diseases. 30 In our study, we uncovered a novel and crucial molecular mechanism for hepatic T-cell constraint, and successfully used LSECtin protein and cDNA to treat acute liver injury. This hepatic immune regulation mechanism may provide important insights into hepatic physiology and pathophysiology and could be promising for the treatment of hepatic diseases.",
