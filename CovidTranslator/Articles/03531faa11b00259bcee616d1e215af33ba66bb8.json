This variability is independent of the breeding characteristics of the strain. The two strains differed in the slope of the survival curves, with Fischer 344 rats showing a higher survival over the second year of life as well as a lower interindividual variability. A model-free approach based on principal component analysis allowed us to quantify these differences and to highlight some limitations of the classical Gompertzian approach.",

            "text": "RATTUS NORVEGICUS is one of the most frequently used animal models in aging research. Variability in longevity parameters exists among different strains of laboratory rat as well as between populations of the same strain experiencing different environmental conditions (e.g., Chesky and Rockstein, 1976 ; Committee on Animal Models For Research on Aging, 1981) . For instance, housing, climate exposure, physical activity, and dietary condition have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in affecting life expectancy, physiological deterioration, and age-related disease processes in laboratory animals (Committee on Animal Models For research on Aging, 1981; Holloszy et al., 1985; Iwasaki et al., 1988; Coates, 1991; Festing, 1991; Masoro, 1991; Kirkwood, 1992; Pitsikas and Algeri, 1992) . This evidence implies that both genetic and nongenetic variability may result in a different pattern of biological aging among laboratory rats. Although the genetic variability is currently monitored for both inbred rats, that is, to maintain the higher homozygosity (e.g., Festing, 1991) , and outbred rats, that is, to maintain a constant level of heterozygosity (Foisil, 1989; IFFA CREDO, 1990) , the phenotypic variability between rat populations belonging to the same strain has not been systematically investigated (Festing, 1993) . The lack of full information on this matter is fundamentally due to the enormous cost involved in allowing animals to die naturally without being used in experiments. Consequently, longevity data reported in literature are generally referred to a relative small number of animals and never include more then one birth date-class population of the same strain kept under the same environmental conditions. A valuable compromise could be to study a colony of animals using the approach of clinical researches: individuals periodically removed from the group for experiments are considered as drop-outs in the sample group (Armitage, 1971) . In this way the cost of a follow-up would be reduced, and, moreover, sampling could be enlarged. Knowledge of the between populations variability is important to compare data from different experimentations. When we perform experiments on different groups of rats having the same chronological age we presume they have (on average) the same biological status, that is, they are at the same point of their survival curve. The quantitation of between-populations variability gives us some useful information about the reliability and the confidence limits of this assumption. This kind of variability is distinct from interindividual variability, which can be assessed even in a single population of rats. The present study examines the within-and between-strain variability in longevity data among inbred and outbred rats strictly maintained under the same environmental conditions. To this end, over the years 1986-1993, a total of 26 follow-ups for longevity trends were obtained from various birth date-class populations of male Sprague-Dawley and Fischer 344 rats, as are usually used in our studies.",

The correlations among the variables make it possible to describe the data matrix by means of a number P < K of components explaining most of the original variation (Lebart et al., 1984; Stahle and Wold, 1988; Jones and Rice, 1992) . The components are mutually independent of construction and their meaning is easily interpretable by the inspection of the correlation coefficients between the component scores and the original variables (factor loadings) (Lebart et al., 1984) .

F-tests did not reveal significant differences between Fischer 344 and Sprague-Dawley. The entity of the between-groups variability is biologically relevant and of the same size in the two strains. The between-groups variability is measured by the coefficients of variation relative to the different parameters (Table I) . The relevance of this variability is easily appreciable if we consider that Ts0 goes from 23.1 to 29.6 in the Fischer rats and from 22.7 to 28.9 in the Sprague-Dawley strain (Fig. 2) . This variability has nothing to do with interindividual variability that is measured by the Aso and ~ values, where high values of Aso and low values of a correspond to high levels of interindividual variability. The interindividual variability is significantly lower in Fischer rats than in Sprague-Dawley. However, a striking result emerged: Fischer rats tended to modify their parameters as a function of their actual birth date. In fact, statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between birth dates of groups and scores from PC1 (r = -0.830; df --14; t = -5.576; p < 0.0001), but not between birth dates of groups and scores from PC2 (r = -0.388; df = 14; t = -1.577; NS). Consistent results were obtained with the PCI and PC2 related parameters (T75, Tso, T25, and Aso, ct), respectively. Regarding Sprague-Dawley rats, birth dates did not correlate significantly with PC I scores and related parameters, nor with PC2 scores and related parameters. These results point to a general shifting over the years of the survival curves of Fischer 344 toward a decreasing life span, together with a maintenance of their slopes.",

The survival over the second year of life (in our case measured by T75) was significantly higher for Fischer 344 than for Sprague-Dawley rats.

From a methodological point of view it is worth noting that any nonlinear model, for example, the Gompertz equation of survival, implies a discrepancy between the model fitted to the average values (in our case the survival data averaged over all the groups) and the average of the individual Gompertz parameters (in our case the Gompertz equations relative to the individual groups). In our case the mean value of the a parameter (averaged over all the individual fittings) is 0.351 for the Fischer rats (see Table l ), while the ct value deriving from the fitting of the average survival data (Fig. l) is 0.293. The same discrepancy is observed for the other strain. The amount of this discrepancy depends on the between-groups variability: in this case, this variability is not negligible and implies substantially different estimates of the survival parameters (Fig. 2) . It is important to stress that this behavior does not depend on the fitting of the Gompertz equation to real data because the same discrepancy can be observed in simulated curves too (data not shown).",

We purposely avoid discussions about the causal factors explaining our results: the main point of this article is not to explain why, but to measure how much different populations of the same strain can differ in their life expectancy. The populations we analyzed can be considered.a typical sample of the biological material used in aging research: the animals were kept in SPF conditions by Charles River and by our Institute, they experienced the same dietary conditions throughout their life (during his life span a rat experiences at least 10 different food lots, so this source of variability cannot generate any systematic differences between populations). Other noncontrollable variations regarding holding sites, etc. during the 7 years of the overall duration of the study were randomly scattered among the populations: so it is extremely difficult (and perhaps without any real meaning) to emphasize one or more of these variations as causal factors of the observed variability.
