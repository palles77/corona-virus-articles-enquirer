TSHSV-HP2, 3 and 4 were associated with replicase activity, since papain-like protease (PLPs), serinetype endopeptidase, P-loop-containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase, and EndoU-like endoribonuclease motifs were detected. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TSHSV clusters with an arterivirus from a Chinese broad-headed pond turtle.",

This virus has recently become an important factor limiting the sustainable development of T. sinensis farming [5, 13] . When compared with previously discovered T. sinensis viruses, TSHSV appears to be more virulent, causing high mortality both in the wild and in captivity [5] . TSHSVinfected turtles display typical characteristics, namely breathing difficulty, interstitial pneumonia, and hyperemic laryngeal mucosa in the throat [13, 14] . An artificial infection experiment has demonstrated that TSHSV-infected turtles are seriously hemorrhagic in multiple organs, including liver, kidney and intestine [13] . These clinicopathological features induced by T. sinensis are consistent with those typically caused by arteriviruses, including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [1, 4, 7, 11, 18] . In addition, Liu et al. cloned a 435-bp-length amplicon that showed sequence similarity at the amino acid level to the arteriviruses mentioned above [13] . Considering the extremely high degree of infectivity and pathogenicity of TSHSV, it is essential to do more research on this newly discovered virus. In this study, we cloned and analyzed the complete genome of TSHSV, and the biological functions of the encoded hypothetical proteins were predicted.",

Total RNA was extracted from lungs using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Integrated RNA with an OD 260 -to-OD 280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.2 was used for subsequent cDNA synthesis. One \u00b5g of total RNA was reverse transcribed into 5' and 3' cDNA using a SMARTer\u00ae Table 1) . These HPs were calculated to have lengths of 79, 308, 1552, 1692, 169, 194, 329 and 714 amino acids (aa), respectively. Conjoint analysis of a multiple amino acid sequence alignment and NCBI BLAST revealed that TSHSV-HP2, TSHSV-HP3 and TSHSV-HP4 shared partial sequence identity with some arteriviruses, including Chinese broadheaded pond turtle arterivirus, Pebjah virus, PRRSV, Guangdong greater green snake arterivirus, Wuhan Japanese halfbeak arterivirus and EAV [10] . The deduced amino acid sequences were most similar to those of Chinese broad-headed pond turtle arterivirus, while only 26%, 27% and 37% identity was calculated for HP2, HP3 and HP4, respectively (Fig. 1A) . Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome sequence of TSHSV revealed that TSHSV and Chinese broad-headed pond turtle arterivirus clustered in the same branch of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B) . In agreement with a previous analysis [13] , the distinct genome and deduced amino acid sequences demonstrated that the TSHSV is a new arterivirus.",

The tree was generated using the neighborjoining method TSHSV-HP4 were found to contain domains involved in specific biological processes (Table 1) . No specific functional domains were identified in the last five HPs. TSHSV-HP2 shared 31% sequence identity with papain-like protease (PLP) 2 at the amino acid sequence level. PLPs of coronaviruses are involved in processing virus-encoded large replicase polyproteins and also function as deubiquitinating enzymes [19] . This protease has been shown to be synthesized during infection with many coronaviruses, including human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) [6] , murine hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59) [3] , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] , and these viruses are capable of synthesizing different amount of PLPs. The genome of the representative arterivirus PRRSV also contains a region encoding a papain-like cysteine protease alpha (PCPalpha) domain, which gives further support for the potential classification of TSHSV as an arterivirus [17] .",

Serine-type endopeptidases are often involved in viral protein processing. Proteolytic enzymes that require a serine for their catalytic activity are ubiquitous and can be found in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes [9] . They can be associated with a wide range of peptidase activities including exopeptidase, endopeptidase, oligopeptidase and omega-peptidase activity [8] .
