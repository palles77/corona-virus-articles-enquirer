It could be months and at the current production rate may not provide timely protection to the population. Intervention strategies that control the spread of infection will be necessary in this situation, such as the use of the US stockpile of antiviral medication coupled with a 6-month school closure. The agent-based simulation model, EpiSimS, was used to assess the impact of this intervention strategy followed by three different vaccine approaches: (1) 2-dose, 80% effective, (2) 1-dose, 30% effective, and (3) 1 dose, 80% effective. Simulations show that the combination of antivirals, school closures, and a strain-specific vaccine can reduce morbidity and mortality while in effect. A significant second infection wave can occur with current vaccine technology once school closures are relaxed, though an ideal vaccine is able to contain it. In our simulations, worker absenteeism increases in all cases mostly attributed to household adults staying home with children due to the school closures.",

Currently, the US Federal Government has only stockpiled enough antiviral courses for approximately 6.7% of the population (US HHS 2006a). Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures will be necessary until adequate supplies of vaccine and antivirals are available.

These guidelines included non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures, which are crucial when combating a newly emergent disease such as a pandemic. Past and recent experiences with deadly diseases have shown dramatic behavioral changes in the affected population. For example, seven communities used protective sequestration during the second wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic in order to prevent infection (Markel et al. 2006) . Another example of unintended behavioral changes was observed during the 1959 pandemic, in which attack rates decreased during summer school closures (WHO Writing Group 2006) . Currently, school closures continue to show a dramatic decline on seasonal influenza morbidity (Heymann et al. 2004 ). In addition to the behavioral changes mentioned above, other behavioral changes have been observed during epidemics such as wearing protective masks, avoiding crowded places, closures of public places, cancellations of social and sports events, people staying home from work, and business closures. Several of these behavioral modifications including school closures were observed during the SARS outbreak, which helped control its spread (Pang et al. 2003) . Therefore, it is crucial to assess the impact that nonpharmaceutical interventions could have on future disease spread and how they can be optimized .",

One study shows that administering a single dose vaccine with about half the protection of two doses to twice as many people can be more useful than two doses when supplies are limited (German et al. 2006) . Other approaches are being explored to increase vaccine production, such as adjuvants for reducing the amount of antigen required per dose, use of live attenuated influenza vaccine, whole-virus based inactivated vaccines, cell-culture production, and dilution (WHO 2006; Washington Post 2005) . These technology developments might reduce the lag time between identification of the influenza strain and initial availability of vaccine, and might also allow higher US production rates. An ideal vaccine would require only one dose per individual for protection with a high efficacy.",

In brief, EpiSimS is an agent-based model that explicitly represents every person in a city, and every place within the city where people interact. A city or region is represented physically by a set of road segment locations and a set of business locations. EpiSimS simulations were run with a synthetic population constructed to statistically match the 2000 population demographics of southern California at the census tract level. The synthetic population consists of 18,828,569 million individuals living in 6 million households, with an additional 938,000 locations representing actual schools, businesses, shops, or restaurant addresses. EpiSimS employs a set of simplifications, approximations, and assumptions that are gradually being improved. The synthetic population of southern California represents only individuals reported as household residents in the 2000 US Census. It does not represent the 2.11% of the population reported as living in group quarters (e.g. jails, dorms, nursing-care facilities). It is not clear to what extent the synthetic population captures the activity patterns of the undocumented population, which made up an estimated 6.5% of the California population in 2000 (US INS 2003) .

(In EpiSimS terminology, a location represents a street address, and a room or mixing place represents a lower-level place where people have face-to-face interactions.) When an infectious person is in a mixing-location with a susceptible person for some computed number of minutes, we compute a probability of disease transmission that depends on the last three of the variables listed above.

Thus, two members of a household might be in contact for 12 hours, even though they would spend 8 hours sleeping in separate bedrooms. Similarly, two co-workers might be counted as spending 5 hours together even though they might spend a small fraction of that time face-to-face. Although EpiSimS has provisions for a user to adjust the relative strength of contact of each activity type for each demographic group, data do not exist to justify such adjustment factors. It is therefore quite possible for EpiSimS to overestimate (for household members that sleep in different bedrooms) or underestimate (for spouses) the household transmission. Nevertheless, EpiSimS obtains a fraction of infections acquired at home that is in rough agreement with other published results (Ferguson et al. 2005; German et al. 2006; Longini et al. 2004) , which suggests that the correlation we observe between average household size and local disease severity is more than an artifact of our assumptions.",

The model consists of five main epidemiological stages: uninfected, latent (non-infectious), incubation (partially infectious), infectious, and recovered. The infectious class is sub-divided into three states: sub-clinical infectious (33% of the cases), symptomatic non-circulating (33%), and symptomatic circulating (33%). We assume that individuals in the subclinical state are half as infectious as the symptomatic individuals and people in the symptomatic non-circulating state are the fraction of the population that self-isolates at home. EpiSimS takes that 50% of adults and seniors, 75% of students, and 80% of pre-schoolers will stay at home within 12 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms. Furthermore, we assume that if a child under the age of 12 self-isolates, an adult will stay at home with the sick child until he or she recovers or dies. The incubation period for influenza has been reported to be from 1 to 3 days with a mean of 1.9 days, which is slightly longer than the latent period. We assumed an interpolated half-day interval histogram with mean 1.9 {0, 0.12, 0.18, 0.259, 0.238, 0.13, 0.07, 0.003} (Longini et al. 2004) , giving respectively the fraction of cases that incubate for a period of between 0 and 0.5 days, 0.5 and 1.0 days, etc. before transitioning to the symptomatic stage. The infectious period ranges between 3 to 6 days with mean of 4.1 days. Thus, we assumed a half-day interval histogram with mean 4.1. The symptomatic stage sojourn time distribution is described by the histogram {0, 0, 0, 0, 0.005, 0.125, 0.16, 0.205, 0.205, 0.12, 0.08, 0.06, 0.04}, giving the fraction of cases that are symptomatic for 0 to 0.5 days, 0.5 to 1.0 days, etc. To simulate the higher attack rates seen in children, we assume that the infection rate in children was double that in adults.

As a result, protection of children is important in a pandemic. Closing schools limits their contacts and exposure to potentially infected classmates and can block paths of spread between families and neighborhoods (Ackerman et al. 1984) . School closures in EpiSimS are implemented as a general closure of selected activity locations. Based on the CDC pandemic guidelines, closures follow a step-like function and are specified in EpiSimS with a start and stop time, the activity to close, a single location, or a fraction of all locations of the specified activity type that will be closed. During the time a closure is in effect, anyone whose activity schedule would have taken them to one of the closed locations will go home during that time instead. They will follow their other scheduled activities as usual. Although, concerns have been raised about alternative activities that children could undertake during school closures, data does not exist to justify such adjustment factors. Given the fraction of schools that the analyst wants to close, schools are chosen at random from the six counties in southern California. In this study 100% of the schools are closed for 6 months starting when 0.1% of the population is symptomatic (day 53), intentionally overlapping vaccination delivery.",

Thus, a baseline scenario was constructed under the assumption of no specific intervention to contain the pandemic and an infection attack rate of 45% with a clinical attack rate of 30%. A value for the reproductive number 0 of 1.8 was calculated for the baseline, which is in agreement with estimated reproduction numbers for pandemic influenza (Longini et al. 2004; Ferguson et al. 2005 ).

A stockpile of antiviral courses for 6.7% of the population is available from the beginning of the simulation. For these scenarios, it is assumed that schools close when 0.1% of the population is symptomatic (day 53) and they remain closed for 6 months. The first wave is defined as the first 233 days when antiviral distribution and school closures are active. This includes some vaccination delivery beginning around day 150. The second wave runs from day 234 till the end of the epidemic and represents time when vaccination and limited antivirals are available. Table 2 shows that in the absence of any intervention, the model predicts a 30.6% clinical attack rate and 614 influenza related deaths per 100,000 persons in the population. Antivirals + school closures for 6 months reduces the clinical attack rate to 1% and a loss of up to 10 lives per 100,000 persons during the first wave. The second wave is dependent on the vaccine approach. Even with a 2-dose vaccine the clinical attack rate is reduced from baseline. The 1-dose (30% effective) vaccine performs similarly, though mortality is lower.",

All the antivirals are used up in the second wave for the 2-dose and 1-dose (30% effective) vaccine approaches by day 323 and 327, respectively. The ideal vaccine approach only uses antivirals for an additional 0.3% of the population in the second wave and results in an overall mortality rate of 9 per 100,000, comparable to 12 deaths per 100,000 for a US flu season. In Fig. 1A -D the symptomatic percentage of the population as a function of time is shown for the baseline and antivirals + school closure scenarios. The arrows denote the time schools are closed. School closures are relaxed after 6 months due to the availability of a strain-specific vaccine. However, given the slow delivery rate of vaccine courses, a second infection wave of cases appears. A 2-dose vaccine and a 1-dose (30% effective) vaccine result in similar second waves. The ideal vaccine approach (see Fig. 1D ) is shown at a smaller scale in comparison due to much smaller numbers of cases in the first and second waves. The first wave is similar across all scenarios with vaccine delivery, though the ideal vaccine results in a much smaller second infection wave. Our results show that an antivirals + school closure scenario can effectively delay the spread of a pandemic until vaccine is available. The administration of vaccine extends the epidemics to nearly 500 days, more than 2.5 times the duration of the baseline scenario. Table 4 shows the percentages of new infections based on the population that occur during home, work, and school activities by wave. In the first wave, new infections are kept low across all activities. New infections increase in the second wave, most significantly at home. The overall percentages are still less than baseline. The ideal vaccine approach provides the best results, keeping new infections lower in the second wave than in the first. Table 5 shows the peak percentage of worker absenteeism and cumulative days absent per worker for each wave. The worker absenteeism peak typically follows the epidemic peak by a few days in an EpiSimS simulation. Antivirals + school closures reduce peak worker absenteeism to about 3% from 8% for the baseline in the first wave, though cumulative days lost has gone up to 5 days. In the first wave, worker absenteeism is mostly because of parents staying home with children due to illness or school closure. In the second wave most absenteeism is due to worker illness, since less people have been effectively vaccinated. The ideal vaccine keeps worker absenteeism in the second wave quite low.",

Even with two waves, the overall clinical attack rate was still lower than the baseline. Besides the benefits of reducing morbidity and mortality, this may reduce the impact on the healthcare system. The typical 2-dose 80% effective vaccine and the single dose 30% effective version were shown to give similar results with a 22% clinical attack rate, though 1-dose results in less mortality. Even at today's vaccine production rates, simulations have also shown that a 1-dose high-efficacy ideal vaccine is able to sustain the clinical attack rate achieved with less than the national stockpile of antivirals and a 6-month school closure, results being comparable to seasonable flu.",
