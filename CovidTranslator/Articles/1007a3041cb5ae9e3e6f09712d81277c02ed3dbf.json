Lober et al. [5] provide a good description of the information sources that can be monitored to detect an outbreak as early as possible. Where affected people present may depend on the type of disease and on the organisation of the healthcare service. In Norway, which has a system of personal general practitioners (GPs) with gatekeeper functions to secondary and tertiary levels of care, patients will typically consult their GP or the casualty clinic in the first instance. Patients are only likely to present at a hospital emergency unit if they are acutely ill (for example, if they have been injured in an accident, or referred to the casualty clinic by the GP). A telephone survey in the USA, in New York, showed that 29.1% of persons with influenzalike illness (ILI) visited a physician, 21.4% called a physician for advice, 8.8% visited the emergency department, and 3.8% called a nurse or health hotline [6] . The EHR systems used by GPs are therefore likely to be very good sources for detecting disease outbreaks in a healthcare context where most people normally consult their GP in the first instance if they get ill. However, using patient data stored in the EHR system is difficult because of the privacy issues involved in exporting data from the EHR systems [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

If a new disease appears, as in the case of SARS, or as result of a deliberate spread, disease surveillance may become more difficult. First, we do not have codes for specifying confirmed, probable or possible cases of the new disease. This may easily be solved if it is sufficient merely to update the coding system. How fast such an update can be performed depends on a number of factors: How fast can the coding system be updated, how fast can the new version be disseminated, how fast can the updated code-set be employed, etc. Updating a disease classification is normally done very infrequently and the reliability of such classifications is therefore problematic when the goal is to count occurrences of a new disease. The creation of an additional coding system for contagious diseases, which enables quick updating, may provide a solution to this prob-lem. However, this is also problematic, because duplication of coding systems adds to the quantity of information, which must be entered into the EHR systems. Basing surveillance of new diseases on existing classification categories is therefore problematic and adds to the complexity of the problem. However, without such disease codes we cannot automatically count the number of cases and get a picture of the geographical diffusion of the disease.",

Conditions with similar symptom patterns may be interpreted as possible or probable cases, thereby polluting the diffusion pattern. In the case of SARS, a visit or contact with a person who had visited a geographic area where there were reported cases was a main indicator of probable or possible cases. Such conditions are not known beforehand [13] . In the case of SARS, the definition of possible and probable cases evolved over the weeks following the outbreak from initially being very vague to becoming a very specific set of symptoms. It may therefore be necessary to distribute new and updated syndrome definitions if local classification of cases based on the syndrome definition is required. This dynamic behaviour of a disease or syndrome definition makes it hard to build software that automatically identifies and distinguishes between possible, probable and confirmed cases.",

[14] are based on the centralised storage and analysis of data. These systems have been classified as using first-or second-generation architectures for data integration [9] . The Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance system (RODS) from the University of Pittsburgh [12] also uses a centralised approach. The emergency departments covered by the system send HL7 messages containing ICD-9 codes in real time to a centralised inference system where outbreaks are detected. When a disease outbreak is detected by RODS, the appropriate authorities are informed about the situation. The outbreak detection process is run periodically on the data available to the system. The Bio-Surveillance, Analysis, Feedback, Evaluation and Response (B-SAFER) system [2, 15] is based on a federated approach involving the open source OpenEMed infrastructure. OpenEMed [16] (formerly known as TeleMed [17] ) is based on the Clinical Observation Access Service (COAS) [18] and Patient Identification Data Service (PIDS) [19] CORBAMed specification of the Object Management Group. B-SAFER and OpenEMed take a more interoperable approach that demonstrates the value of the federated approach to syndromic surveillance, which makes it possible to view and manage information at several levels ranging from local to regional, national and global levels [2] .",

            "text": "We have constructed a system, which we have named \"The Snow Agent system\", after the famous Dr. John Snow. In the Snow Agent system we also take a distributed approach, where all contributors of data to the system also have the opportunity to access information about the current situation in a geographic area directly from the system. In that sense, the Snow Agent system is a true \"peer-to-peer\" net-work among general practitioners. According to Lober's classification [9] , this system would be classified as using thirdgeneration data integration. The Snow Agent system does not depend on the centralised storage of patient information, and may therefore be used by any group of health institutions or general practitioners that want to share data about the health of the population, without exposing any patientsensitive information. It is designed for everyday use by GPs who want to share information about contagious diseases and disease outbreaks in their local community. It also avoids the problematic privacy issues, because no patient-identifiable information ever leaves the EHR system. It also supports the requirement of regular usage, which is important in being prepared for an emergency [3, 20] . The Snow Agent system has a number of other applications besides syndromic or disease surveillance and epidemiology. Most important is the extraction, collection and visualisation of a patient's health record from distributed EHR systems for authorised persons. The system also makes it possible to generate statistics about the activity in the health institutions covered by the system. The messaging system used by the Snow Agent system may also be used for transferring any kind of data between health institutions, which is a valuable spin-off. However, in this paper we focus on the requirements that we argue syndromic, disease surveillance and epidemiology systems may need to meet when facing a local, national or a pandemic outbreak of a communicable disease. Some of these requirements also correspond to the requirements for extraction, collection and visualisation of a patient's health record. The paper presents the core principle utilised in building a distributed system for monitoring and interrogating the status of the population's health, and discusses the results of the initial system tests.",

            "text": "The work reported here has been conceived within the engineering paradigm. The processes involved in building a system can be divided into the distinctive phases of analysis, system specification, design, implementation and testing. The system described here has gone through several iterations of analysis, system specification, design, implementation, and testing. The requirements listed in the section below are derived from the following sources: (1) a project that evaluated the needs and conditions for access to patient information from geographically distributed electronic health records [21] ; (2) an analysis of the SARS outbreak in March 2003; (3) an analysis of a whooping cough outbreak in Troms County in North Norway in October/November 2003. The requirements were validated and augmented by a literature study of syndromic and disease surveillance systems and solutions directed towards early detections of bio-terrorist attacks [2] [3] [4] [5] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . The Snow Agent system is a redesign and a complete reimplementation of the Virtual Secretary system [41] in terms of the requirements reported here. The initial Virtual Secretary system was developed at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Troms\u00f8. The current version is built on top of the Jabber Instant Messaging and Presence system. (see details in Section 4, \"propagation of program control\" below.) To test the system components, we implemented a distributed epidemiology service which extracts epidemiological data from simulated EHR databases. The test data used for constructing the EHR databases is described in the next section. The hardware and software used for system testing is described in Section 2.2 below.",

We assume that all GPs have the same behaviour regarding entering data into the electronic patient record (EHR) system. 3. They all create a consultation entry in the EHR system using the date and time values specified above. 4. They all do a test from the posterior nasopharynx using darcon or calcium alginate swabs, which they send to the hospital laboratory and order a \"B. pertussis PCR\" (Bordertella pertussis) laboratory test (ICPC2 process code-33 Microbiological/Immunological Test) (code 6232 and 6192 in the lab system). 5. If the lab report is negative, the GP does nothing. If the lab test is positive, the doctor creates a telephone consultation with the patient using \"R71 Whooping cough\" as the diagnosis, and prescribes erythromycin. Five days later the patient is assumed not to be contagious to others. (Pertussis is most contagious during the first week. Three weeks after the onset of symptoms, the patient is seldom contagious.) 6. The \"X days since onset\" value for the whooping cough patients will probably vary widely. We assume the distribution of X is Gaussian. We assume that most people will not see their GP before the second stage of the disease has started (7-14 days after onset of symptoms), when the severe cough with whooping and vomiting begins. This value may also vary with the age and gender of the patient. We assume it is likely that babies under the age of one (below 1 year in the test dataset) probably see their doctor earlier than older children do. We also assume male patients wait longer to see their GP than female patients do. Knowledge about an outbreak probably also affects how early a patient sees their GP. We assume that children <2 years see their GP 2-5 days after onset of symptoms, children \u22652, <8 years see their GP 3-7 days after onset, and that children \u22658, <18 years see their GP 5-10 days after onset.

The Agent daemon and the Mission Controller are built as extensions to the Jabber extensible open source server version 1.4.2 [56] , as shown in Fig. 1 . Jabber implements the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (IETF RFCs) [57, 58] , which allows users to show their presence, chat, and exchange instant mes- sages (XMPP messages).

We use the term \"mission agent\" for the incarnation of an agent that runs on a single computer. The mission agent is instantiated by an Agent daemon that creates the mission agent processes. An agent (or agent mission) may therefore consist of several mission agents that run in parallel on multiple hosts or serially as a relay.

In Fig. 2a , the mission specification specifies a spread mode mission, in Fig. 2b it specifies a jump mode mission. Fig. 3 shows the phases of the mission agent's life cycle on the hosts in a spread mode mission. In spread mode missions, the Mission Controller forwards the mission specification to the remote Agent daemons, indicated by the arrows labelled \"1\" in Fig. 2a . The Mission Controller negotiates with several remote Agent daemons simultaneously. This is illustrated by the negotiation phase in Fig. 3 . The Agent daemons may respond with a waiting time for execution. This is illustrated by the waiting phase shown in Fig. 3 . After the potential waiting phase, the mission agents are instantiated by the Agent daemon and the mission specification is transferred (through the connection to the c2s component). This stage is shown as the activation phase in Fig. 3 . When the complete mission specification (including the task specification and data) is transferred, the mission agents become operational and start performing their tasks. This is illustrated by the working phase in Fig. 3 . Mission agents are potentially instanti- ated on each host covered by the mission and run in parallel until the mission has ended. When a mission agent has finished its task, the mission result can be transferred to the mission requester as illustrated by the arrows labelled \"2\" in Fig. 2a .",

A post office may serve all GPs in a county or a single municipality. If the EHR installation needs to be protected by a firewall that blocks incoming connections from the network into the EHR system, the hierarchical model is needed. The Snow Agent system uses two additional Jabber extensions to enable periodical connections to the centralised Snow Agent server (Jabber + Snow Agent system extensions). In this organisation, the Snow Agent servers have two distinct roles, the \"poller\" and the \"post office\" roles. The \"post office\" server provides offline storage and relay of XMPP messages on behalf of the \"poller\" which is the EHR installation. The Snow Agent server behind the firewall, the poller, must take the initiative to connect to the post office (outgoing connection). When the connection is established, and authentication is performed, the poller will receive all messages and processing requests stored by the post office server while the poller was offline (see Fig. 1 above.) The poller may also choose to stay constantly connected to the post office. These two components make it possible to treat a hierarchically organised network as a peerto-peer network. The hierarchical model enables GP clinics protected by firewalls to periodically receive computing requests (in the form of a mission specification). It also satisfies the Norwegian Data Inspectorate's requirements for how small health institutions and GP clinics can connect to a common health network [61] . These requirements state that it should be impossible to open connections from the network into the EHR system protected by the firewall.",

Use of the cache reduces the processing time to an average of 1.53 s (over 10 execution runs with S.D. 0.57) when interrogating the server in Troms\u00f8, Norway from Brisbane, Australia. By relaxing the requirement for freshness of data, and scheduling periodic epidemiology missions to slow hosts, it seems to be possible to achieve an acceptable response time from the epidemiology service even if servers with 1997 technology (server 6) are used.

In a situation with many infected persons, the size of the mission result will increase towards the maximum of all postcodes covered by the GP clinic. The realistic capacity requirement of the system can therefore be estimated by counting the number of postcodes covered by the GP clinic and calculating the maximum throughput required for the system.",

The Snow Agent system approach has the advantage that it is capable of accessing high quality data that precedes disease outbreak detection in a laboratory by many hours. The time advantage may sometimes be as much as a day, depending on geography and sample delivery routines. If the system counts the occurrences of prodromes or even just the rate of lab test requests, it can raise the awareness of local GPs about an outbreak long before the laboratory sees enough cases to issue an alarm. The Snow Agent system also has the advantage that it can count cases that are diagnosed using epidemiological techniques, for instance in situations where a whole family is affected.

From our point of view, such systems should be distributed and decentralised to provide doctors with an appropriate tool to discover local disease outbreaks, and to avoid the associated privacy issues. Such a system must support two-way communication, to enable the participating EHR systems to incorporate new disease or syndrome definitions. The Snow Agent system makes it possible to collect epidemiological data directly from the EHR system in a geographical area based on a task specification. The core principle utilised to achieve this is propagation of program control, which lets computing processes or programs migrate between hosts in the same manner as a mobile-code-based system. In our approach, we do not move code, because of the security and authorisation problems inherent in mobile-code-based systems. Instead, we propagate program control by moving a task specification and data between the hosts.",

The response time of the slowest server limits the response time of the epidemiological service.
