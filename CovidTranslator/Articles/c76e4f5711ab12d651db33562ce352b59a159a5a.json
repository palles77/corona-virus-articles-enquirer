Similarly, the affinity of BToV for the tissues of the respiratory tract has been reported (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1991 (Vanopdenbosch et al., , 1992 , although these finding are still unclear due to possible contamination of the reagents used (Cornelissen et al., 1998) . In addition, a study conducted at a single farm in the United States showed the presence of BToV in both fecal and nasal swabs from feedlot cattle, suggesting that BToV infections may occur in cattle via the nasal route (Hoet et al., 2002) . However, no surveys concerning with the relation between respiratory symptoms and the detection of BToV have been conducted in wide range. Viral isolation via cell culture is the most desirable method for obtaining such epidemiological data, but no reports have described the detection of BToV in cultured cells except for that made by Kuwabara et al. (2007) in which cytopathogenic BToV was isolated from HRT-18 cells derived from a human rectal adenocarcinoma. Amplification of the N gene by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has shown a high degree of conservation among BToV strains (Ito et al., Bovine torovirus (BToV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a causative agent of diarrhea in cattle, but it may also possess tropism for the respiratory tract. However, no surveys concerning with the relation between respiratory symptoms and the detection of BToV have been conducted in wide range. Among 311 nasal samples, BToV gene products were detected in seven samples (rBToV-1 to -7) derived only from calves with respiratory symptoms, suggesting that BToV may be a predisposing factor and/or causative agent for bovine respiratory disease. Regarding the degree of similarity between the spike and hemagglutinin-esterase coding regions, the rBToVs showed over 90.8% similarity with one another and 73.5-99.0% similarity with fecal tract-derived BToVs. rBToV-1, -2, and -3 were identical despite their being collected during different seasons; in comparison, rBToV-4 and -5 were distinct despite the fact that they were collected from the same herd, suggesting the existence of diversity among domestic rBToVs. One animal with a BToVpositive nasal sample also shed the virus in its feces, suggesting dual tropisms for BToV.",

Additionally, isolation of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) was performed using bovine testis and bovine kidney cells. Subsequently, the S and HE gene regions of BToV, which have been shown to be correlated with the antigenic properties of coronavirus (Clark, 1993; Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Jackwood et al., 2005; Phillips et al., 2001; Yoo and Deregt, 2001) , were amplified from the BToV-N gene-positive samples, and their nucleotide sequences were compared to investigate the level of genetic diversity among the BToVs detected in the nasal samples with one another and against previously collected fecal samples (Draker et al., 2006; Duckmanton et al., 1998b; Ito et al., 2007; Kuwabara et al., 2007; Smits et al., 2003) . Nasal swabs were collected from 205 cattle showing respiratory symptoms and 106 asymptomatic cattle raised on 42 farms located in 16 prefectures between March 2006 and June 2008; 264 of the cattle were less than 12 months old.",

Seven BToV-N-positive samples, referred to as rBToV-1 through -7, were identified in six herds from five prefectures (Table 1b) . Compared to the report from the U.S. feedlot, in which BToV was detected in almost all of the cattle during the first 21 days after arrival (Hoet et al., 2002) , the frequency of BToV-positive cattle in this study was significantly lower. The reason of this difference is unclear at present as the sampling condition (population size, nature of farms, sampling period) between Hoet et al. and our study differ considerably. Supporting this idea, Hoet et al. (2002) reported that newly arrived feedlot calves became infected with BToV soon after arrival and shed BToV in their feces and nasal secretions; however, secretion of the virus disappeared according to the calves acquired immunocompetence against BToV. Compared to the detection situation of BCV among the 311 samples, the detection of BToV was restricted to symptomatic calves. In addition, the detection rate was less than half that for BCV; however, our results support the notion that BToV is shed in nasal secretions as well as in feces, and that like BCV, the virus is able to infect its host via oral and nasal routes.",

The BToV-N-positive samples were collected over a relatively long period of time (year-round except during the warmest season) but all were calves that between the ages of 1 and 8 months developed clinical symptoms (Table 1b) . Among the rBToVs, rBToV-1 was also positive for BCV while rBToV-5 was also positive for Mycoplasma bovis. These samples were additionally examined for several other pathogens known to be associated with respiratory disease (M. bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Pasteurella multocida); however, negative results were obtained for the cattle that were positive for rBToV-2, -3, -4, -6, and -7 (data not shown). Therefore, although the etiological role of BToV in the development of respiratory disease is unclear, BToV may be a predisposing factor for and/or causative agent of bovine respiratory disease in young cattle. Additional field and laboratory studies are needed to elucidate the etiological significance of BToV in bovine respiratory disease. The BToV S gene was detected in all of the N genepositive samples except rBToV-7. Regarding the S coding region, the respiratory tract-derived BToVs showed over 91.1% nucleotide similarity and more than 91.4% amino acid similarity with one another. Compared to the previously identified fecal tract-derived BToVs, rBToV showed 89.6-99.2% nucleotide similarity and 89.3-99.5% amino acid similarity (Table 2a) . The BToVs used for the comparison were BRV-1 and -2 from North America; B145, B150, and B155 from Europe; and K-640, K-644, and Aichi/ 2004 from Japan (see Table 2 for the relevant accession numbers). Among the respiratory tract-derived samples, rBToV-1, -2, and -3 were completely homologous despite the fact that the samples were obtained from cattle raised in distinct areas and during different seasons. These tests were performed one or two times to confirm the initial results.",

As our analysis of the S gene was incomplete, we cannot exclude the possibility that respiratory-derived BToVs possess such distinct features compared to fecal-derived BToVs. However, considering the preservation of the HE coding region, the BToVs detected in the respiratory tract in this study did not show dramatic divergence with the fecal-derived BToVs compared to the level of divergence observed between TGEV and PRCV but rather similar to the situation in bovine enteric/respiratory coronavirus; bovine enteric coronavirus and bovine respiratory coronavirus are not currently distinguishable on the basis of this fundamental property.",

In addition, the sequences of the N, S, and HE genes from these concurrently detected BToVs were identical (data not shown). This implies that the BToVs present in the respiratory and intestinal tracts in this case were identical and supports the idea that BToV possesses dual tropisms (to both the intestinal and respiratory tracts), similar to BCV. In conclusion, while we confirmed the possibility of respiratory tract transmission for BToV and a possible association with respiratory disease in young cattle, its etiological importance in cattle still remains obscure. Further investigation into the interactions between BToV and various tissues, viral persistence, and the immunological responses of infected cattle are needed to clarify the relationship between intestinal and respiratory disease and BToV infection. Isolating BToVs capable of being propagated by cell culture (preferably cytopathogenic) and investigating the immunological responses of infected cattle as well as their antigenic properties are of the utmost importance.",
