SHIP has previously been shown to play a pivotal role in limiting the number of immunoregulatory cells and their function. Aim To determine whether SHIP plays a pivotal role in control of immune tolerance in the gut mucosa. Methods Gastrointestinal pathology was assessed in three separate strains of SHIP-deficient mice and their respective wild-type (WT) littermates. Gastrointestinal pathology was analysed in SHIP-deficient hosts reconstituted with WT haematopoietic cell grafts, and WT hosts reconstituted with SHIP-deficient haematopoietic cell grafts including whole splenocytes, purified T cells or natural killer (NK) cells. Major immune cell populations were also analysed in the small intestine of SHIP-deficient mice and WT controls. Results SHIP-deficient mice developed segmental, transmural pyo-granulomatous ilietis that recapitulated classical features of Crohn's disease enteric pathology. Analysis of haematopoietic chimeras showed that WT bone marrow reconstitution of SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 hosts corrects ileitis. Reconstitution with SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 splenocytes transferred ileitis to WT hosts. Adoptive transfer of purified SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 T cells or NK cells to WT hosts did not transfer ileitis. There was a paucity of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the small intestines of SHIP-deficient mice; however, neutrophil numbers were significantly increased.",

            "text": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can affect various sites within the gastrointestinal tract, but classically the ileum, which leads to abdominal cramping, diarrhoea and gastrointestinal bleeding. 1e4 CD histopathological lesions begin with the formation of multiple aphthoid ulcers infiltrated by neutrophils, which progress and coalesce into sharply delimited, regional, transmural inflammations with granuloma formation, thickening of the muscularis propria, strictures, fissures and fistulas. 1e4 Although genome-wide association studies have identified more than 30 susceptibility loci for IBD that disturb either intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) barrier homeostasis or immune effector cell functions and interactions with luminal flora and antigens, 5e7 many susceptibility genes possess differing functions in IEC and haematopoietic cells, and primary IEC or immunological defects in genetically susceptible individuals often remain enigmatic. 8 9 Primary immunological alterations proposed to contribute to the development of CD pathology include increased expression of Th1-polarising cytokines interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon g by cells in the lamina propria, 10 11 aberrant IL-23initiated Th17-associated immune responses, 12 13 defects in regulatory T cell (Treg) modulation of effector functions via transforming growth factor b or IL-10 dependent mechanisms, 14 aberrant B-cell specificity and serum autoreactivity 15 and myeloid cell dysfunction. 16 That primary defects in immune cell function contribute to CD in some patients is supported by reports of disease remission following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. 17 This paper is freely available online under the BMJ Journals unlocked scheme, see http:// gut.bmj.com/site/about/ unlocked.xhtml",

            "text": "The Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing inositol-5-phosphatase (SHIP) protein becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in haematopoietic cells following activation of surface receptors for various cytokines including erythropoietin, IL-3, GM-CSF, M-CSF, or in response to B cell antigen receptor cross-linking, or T cell activation. 29 30 SHIP signalling plays a pivotal role in limiting the number and function of immunoregulatory cells in the peripheral lymphoid system. 31e37 We recently found that SHIP limits the number of immunoregulatory T cells present in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. 35 SHIP performs this role by controlling the number of Treg cells in the periphery either by limiting the survival of FoxP3 + Treg cells or by preventing the inappropriate acquisition of FoxP3 expression by na\u00efve CD4 T cells. 35 Consistent with this finding, the p110 subunit of an enzyme that SHIP opposes, PI3K, is critical for the formation and survival of Treg cells in the periphery. 38 39 SHIP-deficiency also promotes the inappropriate expansion of myeloid immunoregulatory (MIR) cells in spleen and lymph nodes. 32 33 Thus, in major peripheral lymphoid tissues like spleen and lymph node, SHIP-deficiency leads to profound and functional expansion of immunoregulatory capacity. In aggregate these studies establish that inositol phospholipid signalling plays a pivotal role in the formation, homeostasis and function of both myeloid and lymphoid immunoregulatory cell populations. SHIP, through its 5 9 -inositol phosphatase domain, hydrolyses the second messenger PI(3,4,5)P 3 and thus limits PI3K activation of key downstream immune effector pathways such as Akt and NF-kB. 30 40 SHIP-deficient mice are smaller than their WT and heterozygous littermates and exhibit a greatly reduced lifespan with survival beyond 10e12 weeks of life observed only rarely, 32 41 attributable in part to the development of an eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia with infiltration by mixed inflammatory cells resulting in patchy lung consolidation. 41 Eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia is a cause of shortened life span in various genetically engineered mouse models. 42 43 Granulocytes are less susceptible to apoptotic signals in SHIP-deficient mice, and granulocyteemonocyte infiltrations can be found in the liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas lymph nodes and thymus. 44 The increased capacity of SHIP-deficient T cells to differentiate into Treg cells is accompanied by a deficiency in Th17 cell differentiation and a reduced ability to cause colitis after adoptive transfer of CD4 + T cells to T cell deficient hosts. 35 36 Although SHIP expression and function has generally been thought to be confined to cells in the haematopoietic system, recent evidence indicates that SHIP is also expressed by some parenchymal cell types, including osteoblasts 45 and endothelial cells. 46 In fact, we recently identified the first known function for SHIP outside the haematolymphoid compartment as SHIP is required for support of haematopoietic stem cell function and quiescence by bone marrow (BM) niche cells. 45 Given its role in immune regulation and lymphoid function we sought to examine whether SHIP-deficiency might have consequences at enteric mucosal surfaces where greater stress is placed on both immune effector and regulatory processes due to the close and constant interaction with commensal microflora and potential pathogens at this organ site. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals a paucity of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the small intestine with a concomitant increase in neutrophils at this site. Consistent with altered immune status we find spontaneous development of ileitis with features that closely recapitulate those of CD pathology. In addition, the susceptibility factor for this CD-like ileitis of SHIP-deficient mice appears to be in the haematopoietic compartment, and likely granulocytee monocyte, as the CD-like ileitis was transferable to an immunocompetent host following irradiation and reconstitution with SHIP splenocytes, but not following transfer of either T cells or natural killer (NK) cells. Consequently, the SHIP-deficient mouse is the first CD animal model capable of adoptively transferring CD-like disease to an immunocompetent host.",

In brief SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were generated by deletion of the promoter and first exon of SHIP via a Cre-LoxP strategy and then backcrossed to the C57BL6/J background. SHIP DIP/DIP mice were a kind gift of Dr Jeffery Ravetch (Rockefeller University, New York). 47 MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice were described previously. 33 SHIP expression is ablated in these mice following three intraperitoneal injections of polyI/C at 625m/ dose. MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice were sacrificed for tissue harvest 4e5 weeks after the last polyI/C injection. The PI3K haploinsufficient SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 mice analysed in this study possess a mutation in the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K 48 and a SHIP mutation created by Helgason et al. 41 All mice were between 6 and 13 weeks of age at time of sacrifice. All mice were maintained in an accredited, barrier facility confirmed free of a comprehensive list of potential parasites and microbial pathogens including Citrobacter rodentium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., and Clostridium perfringens, Adoptive transfer experiments BM cells were flushed from intact femur and tibia and collected in tissue media (TM) consisting of RPMI, 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). Spleens were crushed with a 10 ml syringe plunger. The single cell suspension was then filtered through a 70 mm strainer (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) and red blood cell (RBC) lysis performed at room temperature for 5 min in 13 RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, California, USA). Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 13 Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS). C57BL/6 recipients were given antibiotic water prior to receiving a split dose of 1100 Rads (600+500) from an x-ray irradiator. Irradiated recipients were then transplanted with 5310 5 BM cells or splenocytes as indicated via retro-orbital injection. For adoptive transfer of T and NK cells, CD3 + NKp46 \u00c0 T and NKp46 + CD3 \u00c0 NK cells were simultaneously sorted from spleens of SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and adoptively transferred into irradiated C57BL6 hosts (550 Rads) via retro-orbital injection. Each C57BL/6 host received 2.4310 5 SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 T cells and 7.5310 3 SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 NK cells.",

The skin, subcutis, skeletal muscle, inguinal lymph node and mammary fat pad, cervical lymph node, salivary glands, reproductive tract and associated glands, liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys and adrenal glands, were evaluated. The larynx, trachea with attached thyroid and parathyroid glands, heart, thymus, and lungs insufflated with 10% neutral-buffered formalin were collected. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutralbuffered formalin, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 3 mm and stained with H&E. Histological sections of each segment of the alimentary tract were masked, assessed and assigned an inflammatory grade of 0e6, with grade 6 representing the most progressed, severe lesion. Inflammatory grades assigned were as follows: inflammatory grade 0\u00bcno significant abnormalities; inflammatory grade 1\u00bcmild predominantly polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocyte infiltrations (<25 PMN/ hpf) of the lamina propria and/or enteric lymph nodule; inflammatory grade 2\u00bcmoderate predominantly PMN leucocyte infiltrations (>25 cells/hpf) of the lamina propria and/or lymph nodule; inflammatory grade 3\u00bcmarked inflammatory cell infiltrations with extension below the muscularis mucosa causing architectural distortion of the mucosa and submucosa with attendant crypt hyperplasia; inflammatory grade 4\u00bcmarked infiltrations with extension into the tunica muscularis; inflammatory grade 5\u00bcmarked transmural leucocyte infiltrations; inflammatory grade 6\u00bcmarked transmural leucocyte infiltrations with extension into the mesentery and/or other organs. In each section the presence of granuloma, crypt abscess, stricture, fissure, and whether dissemination of inflammation to other sites had occurred was noted. Inflammatory scores were compared between cohorts by one-way ANOVA. All reported p-values are two-sided with p<0.01 considered significant. The sections were scored by a single, board certified veterinary pathologist. The sections were scored by a veterinary pathologist with confirmation of scoring system and subsequent gradations by a clinical pathologist.",

Grade 4 ileitis was typically sharply delimited aggregates of pyo-granulomatous inflammatory cell infiltrations, at times in rosary-bead arrays (F, arrows), that caused thickening of the bowel wall (G, arrows) and lumen narrowing. Multinucleated giant cells (H), and pyo-granulomas (I) were frequently present in affected segments, but crypt abscesses (J, arrow) were less frequently observed. of FACS-purified CD3 + T cells, NK1.1 + CD3 \u00c0 NK cells prepared from the spleens of SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 mice was unable to transfer any detectable ileitis to WT hosts (three hosts analysed per cell type). Thus, SHIP-deficient T cells or NK cells are sufficient for transfer of ileitis. We also observed that SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 splenocytes transfer a mild to moderate eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia to WT hosts with progression to patchy pulmonary consolidation in some cases as is observed in both germline SHIPdeficient mice 41 and MxCreSHIP flox/flox mice following gene ablation. 49 Neutrophilia combined with T cell paucity in the SHIP-deficient small intestine Our pathology findings and adoptive transfer studies described above suggest that a granulocyteemonocyte lineage cell may underlie the ileitis that we observe in SHIP-deficient mice. To further evaluate this possibility, we conducted multi-parametric cytometry assays of major immune cell populations including neutrophils, dendritic cells, CD4/CD8 T cells and Treg cells present in small intestines of SHIP-deficient and WT mice. In support of a role for neutrophils in ileitis, we find there is an absolute increase in total number of neutrophils present in the small intestine of SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( figure 10 ). This applied to neutrophils of the Ly6G + CD16/32 + phenotype as well as the CD62L + subset ( figure 10 A,B) . These findings of ileal neutrophilia are consistent with our histopathology studies described above. Surprisingly, we find a profound reduction in the number of both CD4 (figure 11A) and CD8 (figure 11B) T cells present in SHIP-deficient small intestines. When paired with the T cell adoptive transfer studies described above, these findings suggest that the CD-like ileitis observed in SHIP-deficient mice is not attributable to an autoimmune attack by SHIPdeficient T cells. Analysis of CD11c + CD11b + mature dendritic cells and CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells did not show a significant difference in the numbers of these immune cells between SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 and WT small intestines.",

Although elements of CD pathology are lacking in the SHIP-deficient mouse described herein, including development of multiple aphthoid ulcers, pyloric gland metaplasia, granulation tissue, and fistula formation, many CD histopathological features are present. SHIP-deficient ileitis is not precipitated by an apparent dysfunction on the part of SHIPdeficient parenchymal elements as reconstitution of SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 hosts with SHIP-competent haematolymphoid cells prevents development of ileitis. However, these same hosts still retain some facets of eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia indicating that SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 parenchymal elements may contribute to the lung pathology found in germline SHIP-deficient mice. Conversely, we find that transfer of SHIP-deficient haematolymphoid cells from the spleen is sufficient to trigger CD-like ileitis in an immunocompetent host. Transfer of cells capable of a cellmediated immune attack, T cells and NK cells, do not elicit this CD-like ileitis. These findings suggest that a SHIP-deficient myeloid cell may promote the CD-like enteritis that occurs in SHIP-deficient mice. Granulocytes are less susceptible to apoptotic signals in SHIP-deficient mice, granulocyteemonocyte infiltrations can be found in various tissues of SHIP-deficient mice, 44 and mononuclear phagocytes are essential for maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. 50 Retention of components of eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia in the SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 hosts reconstituted with WT BM indicates that aspects of this lung pathology are of a parenchymal, cell autonomous origin. Mass spectrometry analyses have identified Ym1 as the principal crystalline protein of this pneumonia, perhaps secreted by activated alveolar macrophages, and proposed to be involved in eosinophil recruitment, immune activation and tissue repair. 34 However, since SHIP-deficient mice that undergo allogeneic BM transplant have a normal lifespan, 32 these retained features of pulmonary pathology are apparently not sufficient to progress to the fatal lung consolidation that occurs in germline, SHIP-deficient mice. 41 Further, with the present observations, CD-like enteritis should be included among the pathologies that develop and contribute to morbidity and mortality in germline, SHIP-deficient mice.",

There are a number of possible candidates for the enteritis-inducing cell. Because we observed neutrophilic infiltrates in the distal ileum lamina propria of most SHIP-deficient mice, we speculate that inappropriate responses by neutrophils to commensal microflora in the lumen of the ileum may underlie or trigger the immune attack. SHIP plays a pivotal role in preventing neutrophilia, as granulocyte numbers in peripheral blood are profoundly increased in SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 mice 41 as well as mice treated with a SHIP1 selective inhibitor, 3AC. 49 Inappropriate effector function by SHIP \u00c0/\u00c0 neutrophils at organ sites has not been examined to date, and thus our findings represent the first indication of neutrophil-mediated tissue damage in SHIP-deficient hosts. Conversely, it seems unlikely that the enteritis results from inappropriate T cell attack in the small intestine, as SHIP-deficiency causes a profound local deficit in both CD4 and CD8 T cell numbers in the small intestine, while normal numbers of Treg cells are still present at this site.",

Moreover, because the phenotype occurs in the SHIP DIPDIP strain where only the inositol phosphatase domain encoding exons of SHIP are excised, we conclude that the phenotype is dependent on loss of SHIP enzymatic activity. SHIP through its 5 9 -inositol phosphatase domain hydrolyses the second messenger PI(3,4,5)P 3 and thus limits PI3K activation of key downstream survival and effector pathways promoted by Akt and NF-kB. 30 40 However, recent findings indicate that SHIP, via generation of PI(3,4)P 2 , can also promote cellular survival by increasing activation of Akt, 49 consistent with the demonstration that Akt binds to and is more effectively activated by the SHIP product, PI(3,4)P 2 , than by its substrate, PI(3,4,5)P 3 . 51 Tiwari et al found that SHIP can also promote immune effector function via synthesis of PI(3,4)P 2 . 52 It remains to be determined whether SHIP-deficiency is causing ileitis due to a lack of inhibitory or activating signalling in immune cells. This may be dependent on cellular context. For instance, one could envision that SHIP may be required for efficient mucosal trafficking and survival of T cells via generation of PI(3,4)P 2 , but by decreasing PI(3,4,5)P 3 in neutrophils SHIP is also limiting their numbers and function at this enteric site. Future lineage specific SHIP ablation studies using SHIP flox/flox mice and appropriate Cre transgenes combined with biochemical analysis PI3K effector pathways in these models may elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying SHIP's role in preserving normal immune function/regulation in the ileum.",

Tantalising evidence for a role of SHIP1 in human IBD is suggested by the recent demonstration that a chromosome 2 polymorphism located at 2q37 is associated with a significantly increased and early onset of IBD. 53 The SHIP1 locus is also found in the 2q37 region of human chromosome 2. This potential association merits comparison of SHIP enzymatic activity in IBD patients and normal controls using a recently developed fluorogenic assay that measures SHIP1 activity. 49 Future investigations of cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for ileitis in SHIP-deficient mice may also provide insights into how immunological alterations contribute to IBD.",
