Although blood glucose control and management of coexisting risk factors are overall goals, the implementation of dietary management is a highly complex and individualized process. Principles of medical nutrition therapy that generally apply to all diabetes, and specific features that apply to the various types of diabetes, have been discussed; but it must be emphasized that good nutritional management requires the close interaction of each individual patient with a knowledgeable expert in dietetics.

            "text": "Diarrheal illnesses in young children are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Diarrhea is an important cause of morbidity in developed countries as well. In developing countries, children younger than 5 years old suffer 3-10 episodes of diarrhea per year, whereas in developed countries young children have on average 1 or 2 diarrheal episodes per year. The advent of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and its use in the past three decades have dramatically reduced the case fatality rate for diarrhea. However, globally the estimated 3 billion annual episodes of diarrhea account for approximately 2 million deaths in children younger than 5 years old. The majority of diarrhea-related mortality occurs in developing countries and the highest rates of diarrhea occur among infants with malnutrition. The case fatality rate is highest among children 6 months to 1 year old. The primary reason is that for most children this is the period when the immune system is not yet fully matured and the maternal antibodies are reduced. In addition, they may receive contaminated foods to complement breast-feeding, and they begin to crawl, potentially to areas where they may have direct contact with human or animal feces. Although dehydration is the most direct effect of diarrhea, there are many adverse and potentially fatal nutritional consequences when proper nutritional management is not followed. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology of diarrheal diseases, including the interaction of diarrhea and malnutrition, and discusses the treatment of diarrhea, including fluid therapy and dietary management to minimize the nutritional cost of diarrhea.",

            "text": "Malnourished children have defects in cell-mediated immune functions and a decrease in IgA-containing cells in the jejunal mucosa. Malnutrition produces morphological and functional changes in virtually all organs. Changes in the intestine include thinning of the gut epithelium, marked flattening and broadening of villi, extensive infiltration of the lamina propria, and diminished secretion of gastric acid. These changes lead to an increased risk of diarrhea. The risk of developing diarrhea may be predicted by a child's ability to respond to skin test antigens. This effect of impaired cellular immunity is independent of age and nutritional status. Studies have shown that patients with a variety of viral and bacterial infections, such as measles, influenza, tuberculosis, and streptococcal infections, develop impaired cellmediated immunity (anergy). Anergy or reduced responsiveness may also be associated with single nutrient deficiency, such as deficiency of vitamin A, zinc, pyridoxine, folic acid, and iron. Therefore, it may be possible that in an otherwise healthy child, infection or micronutrient deficiencies induce immunodeficiency may increase susceptibility to diarrhea and other infections and lead to a vicious cycle of repeated infections, anergy, and deteriorating nutritional status.",

Community-based prospective studies in developing countries have consistently demonstrated a significant negative effect of diarrhea on short-term weight gain, but studies on the effect on short-term height gain are less consistent. On the contrary, some investigators have concluded that the effect of diarrhea on growth is transient and that efforts to control diarrhea are unlikely to improve children's nutritional status. One possible explanation for the discrepant findings is the heterogeneity of diarrheal illnesses. Most studies that have examined the effect of diarrhea on growth have considered diarrhea as a single entity. Studies that have examined the effect of diarrhea on growth by type of diarrheal illness have suggested that certain etiological (e.g., Shigella spp.) and clinicaltype (dysentery) illnesses are associated with significant growth retardation. It has been estimated that diarrheal illnesses account for 10-80% of growth retardation in the first few years of life, with the magnitude of effect possibly modified by other factors, such as etiology and clinical type, the source and adequacy of dietary intake, treatment and feeding practices during and following illness, and the opportunity for catch-up growth after illness. A cohort study conducted in Bangladesh observed that dysentery had the most deleterious consequences on both ponderal and linear growth, although other types of diarrhea showed a similar but relatively less pronounced negative effect on growth. Losses of approximately 0.5 kg in annual weight gain and 1.25 cm in annual height gain were associated with dysentery in children <5 years old in this population.",

Noninfectious diarrhea tends to be persistent because it is often due to a chronic health problem. However, most persistent diarrhea is due to infection or is a sequeale of infection. Infections can lead to persistent diarrhea in the following situations: (i) Some pathogens cause chronic symptoms, usually parasites but sometimes bacteria; (ii) immunosuppressed individuals, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cannot effectively clear pathogens and can develop persistent diarrhea; and (iii) at times the infection clears, but people develop chronic symptoms, such as irritable bowel syndrome, with diarrhea. If the diarrhea is persistent, it can cause dehydration, malnutrition, and systemic infections. Diarrhea in combination with a severe case of malnutrition (e.g., marasmus and kwashiorkor) is very dangerous and can lead to systematic infections and death. Although many different mechanisms may contribute to persistent diarrhea, the result is a similar pathophysiologic syndrome of mucosal atrophy, inflammation, and malabsoption.

At this time, the body is less able to absorb needed macronutrients, including fats and proteins, as well as some carbohydrates. This is most severe in undernourished children who suffer from persistent diarrhea due to damage to the gut epithelium. When the gut is damaged, food is not properly digested or absorbed. The causes of insufficient nutrient absorption include diminished concentration of bile acids, which are used for fat absorption; damaged epithelial cells, which provide the absorptive surface on the bowel; and a deficiency of disaccharides due to damaged microvilli, which normally produce the needed enzymes. In symptomatic rotavirus infection, the most common cause of acute severe diarheal illness worldwide, there is a 42% decrease in the absorption of nitrogen and fat, a 48% decrease in absorption of carbohydrates, and a 55% decrease in the total carbohydrate absorption. Malabsoption is more severe in both ETEC and shigella diarrhea. In shigellosis, loss of protein and vitamin A is sizeable. Giardiasis leads to malabsorption of vitamin A. A large amount of zinc is lost in diarrhea, usually resulting in a negative net zinc balance during the illness.",

Parents should be encouraged to increase fluid intake as soon as diarrhea begins and to give oral rehydration solution if available. Children presenting with diarrhea should be assessed for dehydration. Thirst is an early sign of dehydration in a child. Other signs are mucosal dryness (e.g., dry mouth), sunken eyes, and loss of skin turgor. The coexistence of fever or vomiting exacerbates dehydration. The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines classify dehydration into two categories-some dehydration and severe dehydration. Weight loss is the main clinical index of degree of dehydration. A vast majority of children with diarrhea present with some dehydration or no clinical signs of dehydration. The cornerstone of treatment for these children is oral rehydration solution (ORS) containing glucose or sucrose and electrolytes. ORS is effective but it must start as soon as diarrhea starts. In children with some dehydration, approximately 100 ml/kg of body weight of ORS should be given within 4 h. Ongoing stool losses should be replaced with ORS. Rehydration and maintenance of hydration in a vomiting child is feasible using ORS by giving small amounts frequently. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency that requires immediate intravenous fluid replacement, and children should preferably be hospitalized. Patients presenting with severe dehydration should receive 40 ml/kg body weight of Ringers lactate or similar intravenous solutions over a 4-h period.

For more than three decades, an ORS containing 90 mmol/l of sodium and 111 mmol/l of glucose was used throughout the world. This solution has been credited with saving millions of lives. WHO and UNICEF have recommended the use of a new reduced osmolarity ORS formulation consisting of 75 mmol/l of sodium and 75 mmol/l of glucose and total osmolarity of 245 mOSm/l. This recommendation was made on the basis of studies that have demonstrated that the reduced osmolarity ORS was at least as efficacious as the standard ORS containing 90 mmol/l of sodium and an osmolarity of 311/l. In addition, in a meta-analysis, the reduced osmolarity ORS was shown to decrease the need for unscheduled intravenous therapy by 33%, the stool output was reduced by 20%, and the incidence of vomiting was reduced by 30%. However, there is concern that this low osmolar ORS may lead to asymptomatic and symptomatic hyponatremia in adults with severe diarrhea. This issue needs to be evaluated in large-scale effectiveness trials. Despite the proven efficacy of ORS, only approximately 20% of children receive appropriate ORS therapy during diarrheal episodes. The barriers to use of ORS include lack of knowledge of the importance of rehydration therapy, lack of access to ORS, and the perception that ORS is not a medicine since it does not stop the diarrhea. The management of a child with persistent diarrhea is often difficult due to other related heath issues.

Stool output reduces dramatically when the milk-or lactosecontaining formula is stopped.

On the other hand, children with kwashiorkor must begin a slow feeding treatment starting as low as 50 kcal/kg/day and work their way up to approximately 110 kcal/kg/day after approximately 1 week. This can be a difficult task since these children are often apathetic and have severe anorexia. The initial diets of all severely undernourished children must be given in small, frequent (every 2 h day and night), semiliquid doses. An example of an initial diet packet is 8 g skim milk powder, 6 g vegetable oil, 5 g sugar, and 100 ml water to make a high-energy (100 kcal/ 100 ml) meal with additional minerals, including 60 mg iron, 100 mg folic acid, and 200 000 units of vitamin A and vitamins B (complex), C, and D.",

            "text": "Diarrhea, a disease of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, is an important worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality among infants and children, especially in developing countries. However, it is also very much a nutritional disease. This is primarily because during periods of diarrhea, nutrient intake and absorption are dramatically decreased, which results in undernutrition even when sufficient food is available. The losses of nutrients affect growth rates, and where diarrhea occurs frequently the child may not grow properly. This is a cyclical pattern in that undernourishment in children makes them more prone to diarrhea. Their immune systems are less robust and the episodes affect them more than well-nourished children. Undernourishment and diarrhea can be a fatal combination that can result in a vicious cycle. This cycle requires intervention, sometimes at a treatment center if the case is severe enough. Therefore, is a matter of not only replacing the fluids and electrolytes but also of managing good feeding practices at all times before, during, and after the illness.",
