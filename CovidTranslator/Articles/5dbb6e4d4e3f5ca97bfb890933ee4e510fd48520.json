By using sucrose gradient centrifugation, the Gl and G2 glycoproteins in PTV-infected or recombinant-transfected cells were found to sediment as dimers after DSP cross-linking, suggesting that the G 1 and G2 proteins are associated as dimers by non-covalent interactions. Pulse-chase and two-dimensional gel analysis indicate that dimerization occurs between newly synthesized Gl and G2 proteins, and that a small fraction of the G2 proteins is assembled into G2 homodimers. The amounts of Gl and G2 proteins were substantially decreased, while the amounts of nucleocapsid protein remained nearly unchanged, when PTV-infected cells were treated with the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin, indicating that the Gl and G2 proteins are unstable if glycosylation is prevented.",

A unique feature of the bunyaviruses, which are enveloped viruses with 3 singlestranded, negative sense RNA genomic segments, is their intracellular maturation by budding at smooth-surfaced membranes in the Golgi region (Murphy et al., 1973; Smith and Pifat, 1982) . Two virion glycoproteins, Gl and G2, are encoded by the M genomic segment, translated from a single mRNA as a precursor glycoprotein, and possibly cotranslationally cleaved into the final protein products (Ulmanen et al., 1981; Eshita et al., 1985) . The PTV glycoproteins specifically accumulate in the Golgi complex during virus infection or when expressed by recombinant vaccinia viruses (Matsuoka et al., 1988; Chen et al., 1991a, b) , indicating that the bunyavirus glycoproteins possess signaIs for retention in the Golgi complex (Matsuoka et al., 1991) .",

Distinct hydrophobic regions preceding both the Gl and G2 proteins of PTV can function as signal peptides (Matsuoka et al., 1988; Chen et al., 1991b) . There is a single hydrophobic membrane anchor domain near the C-terminus of each protein, followed by charged amino acids (Ihara et al., 1985; Chen et al., 1991b1 , as seen for the transmembrane domains of other class I viral membrane proteins (Sabatini et al., 1982) . The information for Golgi retention is located within the Gl and G2 glycoproteins, rather than in the non-structural (NS,) sequence (Matsuoka et al., 1988) . In previous studies, we used a recombinant T7 transient expression system and found that Golgi retention of the G2 protein requires interaction with the Gl protein, and that the Gl and G2 glycoproteins form a Gl-G2 heterodimer (Chen et al., 1991b; Chen and Compans, 1991) . In this study, we have further analyzed glycoprotein oligomerization in PTV-infected cells, and compared the process with that found in recombinant-transfected cells. We have also investigated the effect of glycosylation on the stability and transport of PTV glycoproteins.",

HeLa T4+ cells infected with the VV-T7 virus were transfected with the recombinant plasmid DNA, and pulse-labeled. The cell lysates with or without DSP-cross-linking were centrifuged on 5-20% sucrose gradients. Most of the glycoproteins without crosslinking were detected in one peak in the sucrose gradient, at fractions 15-17, while faster-sedimenting forms of the Gl and G2 proteins were recovered from fractions 11-13 after cross-linking (data not shown). When analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, the proteins from fractions 15-17 appeared as monomeric Gl and G2, whereas the proteins in fractions 11-13 appeared as an additional band with an estimated molecular weight of about 118 kDa and a faint additional band with an estimated molecular weight about 95 kDa, which possibly correspond to dimeric forms of the Gl and G2 proteins (not shown). When the samples were analyzed in the presence of reducing agent, the higher-order structures were resolved into the monomeric Gl and G2 proteins, indicating that the higher-order structures consist of cross-linked forms of the Gl and G2 proteins. Since the chemical cross-linking of the proteins is an inefficient reaction, we have not obtained quantitative estimates of the relative proportions of monomers and oligomers. Nevertheless, these data indicate that the Gl and G2 proteins appear to be assembled into non-covalently linked dimers, which are unstable in sucrose gradients but can be stabilized by DSP cross-linking. We further investigated the sucrose gradient sedimentation of mutant PTV glycoproteins by using a mutant pGEM-G(A-) (Chen et al., 1991b) . In contrast to the native glycoproteins, a fraction of the Gl and truncated G2 proteins without cross-linking sedimented to fractions 12-13 (Fig. 2) . Consistent with the sedimentation profile, the Gl and truncated G2 proteins from fractions 15-16 appeared as monomeric forms, and proteins from fractions 12-13 appeared as dimeric forms (estimated molecular weight about 110 kDa) in non-reducing gels (Fig. 2) . The dimers were dissociated into nearly equal amounts of labeled Gl and truncated G2 proteins after treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol. Thus, the Gl and anchor-minus G2 occur as stable dimers, possibly linked by covalent disulfide bonds.",

When analyzed by using a two-dimensional gel system, with non-reducing conditions in the first dimension and reducing conditions in the second dimension, the 11X-kDa band was resolved into two bands with the same mobilities as monomeric Gl and G2 proteins after treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3B) . The 95-kDa band was dissociated into a faint band with the same mobility as the monomeric G2 protein. Furthermore, when the 95-kDa band was cut, reduced, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, a G2 band was observed (not shown). These results are consistent with previous results obtained using a recombinant expression vector , and indicate that the 118-kDa band is a Gi-G2 heterodimer and the 95 kDa band is a G2 homodimer. Furthermore, the heterodimeric bands were resolved into nearly equal amounts of labeled Gl and G2 proteins in the IO-min pulse-labeling sample, indicating that heterodimerization occurs between the newly synthesized Gl and G2 proteins.",

            "text": "Glycosylation of proteins has been shown to be important for protein stability, and maintaining protein conformation. In the case of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G protein, the unglycosylated form of the protein in some strains of the virus formed aggregates which were unable to exit from the ER (Rose and Doms, 1988) , while the unglycosylated form in other strains was transported to the plasma membrane (Gibson et al., 1978) . In this study, we observed that the amounts of PTV Gl and G2 protein were dramatically decreased when the infected cells were treated with increasing concentrations of tunicamycin. Since tunicamycin is not a single compound but is composed of several homologues, some of which inhibit glycosylation as well as protein synthesis (Mahoney and Duksin, 19791 , the decreased amounts of the glycoprotein might have been due to inhibition of protein synthesis. However, this is unlikely since the amount of nucleocapsid protein remained nearly unchanged at all the concentrations of tunicamycin tested. It is also unlikely that the unglycosylated proteins exhibited a decreased solubility or conformational change which made them unrecognizable to antibodies, since both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the proteins by immunofluorescence staining and immunoprecipitation. It has been reported that unglycosylated forms of viral glycoproteins have different stabilities within the same host cells due to degradation by endogenous cellular proteases (Schwarz et al., 1976) . Thus, we believe that the unglycosylated forms of the Gl and G2 protein are unstable, and are degraded by cellular proteases. A similar effect of tunicamycin on the glycoproteins of Hantaan virus was also reported (Schmaljohn et al., 1986) .",

Although the mechanism for retention of resident membrane proteins is still unknown, at least two alternative mechanisms for protein retention in subcellular compartments may be employed. One mechanism is that a retention signal within the protein sequence is responsible for intracellular retention, examples of which include the C-terminal sequence of the E3/19K protein of adenoviruses, or a transmembrane domain of the El protein of coronaviruses (Machamer and Rose, 1987; Jackson et al., 1990) . Alternatively, plasma membrane proteins may be unable to exit from the ER when they fail to correctly fold or assemble as seen in VSV-G and influenza hemagglutinin mutants (Rose and Doms, 1989) . Our studies show that PTV glycoproteins are able to correctly fold and assemble into dimers, which are transported to the Golgi complex. Thus, the Golgi retention of the PTV glycoproteins is mediated by a specific retention mechanism.",
